Severus Snape stumbled into the Headmaster’s study. One look at the man and anyone could tell he was undone; his normally slicked back hair was wild, small pieces falling in his face. His greasy complexion was disturbingly pale and his hands shook as he approached the headmaster’s desk.

“Tell me it isn’t true,” the Slytherin rasped, his voice thick with emotion. “Tell me Lily was spared.”

Headmaster Albus Dumbledore looked up calmly from his seat behind his large mahogany desk. “I’m sorry, Severus.” The older wizard observed the younger one with sympathy in his gaze. His words broke the man across from him, the Slytherin collapsing into a chair, a strangled cry on his lips.

“No!” Snape cried, burying his face in his hands. A moment of silence filled the room as Snape grieved, shoulders wracked with sobs. “You!” The despair was gone, replaced by anger. His head snapped up; Snape glared at the headmaster, hate in his gaze. “You were supposed to protect her! I came to you so you could keep her safe!”

Dumbledore said nothing as Snape snarled at him. He waited until the other wizard had finished before calmly speaking, though his voice was tight. “Lily and James put their faith in the wrong people, Severus. I gave them every protection the Order and I had to offer, but they were betrayed. Not unlike yourself, Severus.”

Severus moaned into his hands, his shoulders wracked with sobs for the woman he had loved, and now lost. He knew Dumbledore referred to the promise he had extracted from the dark lord regarding Lily’s safety - little good that had done.

“Her child lives.” Dumbledore’s voice was soft, barely a whisper. He offered this information as though it would be a comfort.

The Slytherin appeared not to have heard him through his sobs. Dumbledore didn’t push the matter, allowing the man to wallow in his grief. When his grief subsided, Snape stood with a wild look in his eye.

“I need to get away.” Snape looked Dumbledore in the eyes, pleading. “I need to leave, escape for a while.”

“Running away will not -”,br />“I need to leave.” Snape interrupted the headmaster, face drawn into a scowl. “P-please.” His voice cracked, a testimony to how broken the man was, his dark eyes pleading with the man across from him.

Dumbledore regarded him silently for a moment. “I do have a task I need completed, although rest assured it isn’t an easy one.”

Snape’s head snapped up to the headmaster, determination in his gaze. “I’ll do it.”

“Now, we haven’t even -”

“I said I’ll do it!” Snape snarled, turning his back to the older wizard. “When do I leave?”

Dumbledore regarded him curiously for several seconds before offering calmoly, “Now, if you’d like. After I debrief you.”

Snape managed a jerky nod, angling his body so he could glance at the old man. “Perfect.”

	“Albus!” Snape’s sharp voice cut through the night like a hot knife through butter. The alarming tone in it had every teacher crawling from their rooms to see what trouble could be knocking on the doors of Hogwarts, talking quietly amongst themselves.

Dumbledore could be seen gliding down the halls towards the entrance of the Great Hall, dismissing the nosy teachers as he went. Snape was stumbling up the stairs to the school, a small bundle in his hands. It was the alarm in his eyes that had Dumbledore worried; Snape was generally a calm man.

“What is it, Severus?” Albus couldn’t mask his concern, eyes darting questioningly to the bundle in the Slytherin’s arms.

“Something for you.” Snape gestured at the bundle in his arms before offering it to Dumbledore. When Albus’s brow wrinkled in confusion, Snape unwrapped the blankets around it, revealing a surprising package. Dumbledore’s eyes flew open in shock as he stumbled backwards. Inside, swaddled up in layers of blankets and towels was a baby, a newborn. “Severus...”

Snape opened his mouth to explain, physically still shaken from his experience. Before he could speak, the older wizard held up a hand, silencing him. “Not here. To my study. We will discuss this further there.”

Without another word the headmaster covered the baby back up, cradling it close to his chest as he proceeded into the school. Snape followed numbly after him, his body moving as if on its own accord. His mind was in another place - another time - back on his mission.

Dumbledore had sent him on an extremely time sensitive mission… back to the 1950’s. Dumbledore had explained that Voldemort - currently Tom Riddle in this timeline - was due to return to Hogwarts to request a job as Defense Against the Dark Art Professor. Snape had nearly vomited at the thought of Voldemort being in control of the education of young witches and wizards - especially as DADA professor. As part of his mission, Snape was to remain unseen and attempt to understand Voldemort’s true reason for returning to Hogwarts.

“There is more than a need for employment that urged Tom Riddle to apply as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.” Dumbledore had said gravely. “Tom wasn’t yet Voldemort, but I believe he was already well on his way to becoming him when he requested the position.”

“Then how could you let him in Hogwarts to begin with?” Snape spat at Dumbledore.

Dumbledore looked curiously at the Slytherin before him before speaking. “Let’s not forget your mistakes that have brought us here, Severus. Let’s focus on the matter at hand. Tom Riddle will arrive at Hogwarts, and I want you to go several days in advance to his arrival to ensure he didn’t come early for other reasons. You must remain unseen, but I want you to tail him from the moment he sets foot in Hogsmeade.”

“The dark lord is dead,” Snape denied, “why keep fighting?”

Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes boring into the Slytherin’s before him. “There is a day when that mark on your arm will burn again, and on that day you will be faced with a decision: will you fight for the man who killed the woman you love, or will you fight to ensure that the woman you loved did not die in vain?”

A broken sob left Snape’s throat as he turned to avoid eye contact with the headmaster. Severus hung his head in shame as his shoulders shook with silent sobs, even as the determination inside grew almost as strong as the anguish. Lily’s life would not be in vain. “You know what I will do.”

“Then listen.”

A moment of silence.

“As you wish,” Snape said with a curt nod, all traces of emotion wiped from his face.

“Only one catch, my friend.”

Snape said nothing, not wanting to encourage the dramatics as much as he was ready to be on his way.

“You’re going to need a time-turner.”

He had been sent back in time almost immediately after that discussion, with Dumbledore taking a brief moment to remind him of the time-space continuum laws the Ministry has in effect. Upon arriving at Hogwarts circa 1950, he’d had a moment of panic and fled to the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade, where he learned his current apparel would draw too much unwanted attention. Snape spent the next few days watching, studying, and waiting. He learned how to blend in; to appear as though he belonged in the time as he patrolled the streets of Hogsmeade for any sign of the young Dark Lord.. He remained unnoticed, for several days as he waited for Tom’s arrival. Snape grudgingly used the time he had on his hands to familiarize himself with the use of his old master’s name, reminding himself he was not looking for the man he’d once served.

Tom arrived a little less than two days after Severus arrived in 1950. Snape knew the moment he arrived; the magic in Hogsmeade shifted. It became almost… heavy, as though dark magic had pressed upon it. Snape’s eyes followed the man known as Tom Riddle as they walked down opposite sides of the streets. Riddle was handsome; women noticed him on the streets and would scurry away to point him out to their friends, but Riddle never once acknowledged them. He was tall, dressed in nice clothing, but nothing extravagant. There were large rings on his fingers, and he strode down the street with at least six other men, all heavily clad in black. Severus followed them at a distance, casting a Disillusionment charm so he was unnoticeable. When they reached the road that led to Hogwarts, Tom Riddle stopped and turned to his companions.

“I need to continue on from here on my own,” Tom’s voice held no room for questioning. His eyes sought out each man individually, making them shrink before his steely gaze.

“What about Dumbledore?” One of the men in black called out, clearly misunderstanding his Lord’s tone.

“Dumbledore?” Tom seemed almost amused by his companions' concern. “That old bat is no threat; I’m here about a job, nothing more.”

“Do you forget he defeated Grindelwald?” Another man spoke this time, “He’s bound to have heard of our excursions in Europe-”

“Silence!”

The man stopped talking as if his vocal chords had vanished.

“Dumbledore is a brilliant wizard, I won’t deny that. However, I have set certain… insurances… in place. He cannot kill me, no matter how much he may want to.” Tom turned away from his group, placing his back to them.

“I want you to return to Hogsmeade,” Tom said with a note of finality. “I will join you within the hour, possibly two.”

“Yes, my lord.” One by one the men in black turned and strode back towards the tiny town.

Tom waited several minutes for the men to disperse before stuffing his hands in his pocket, and continuing towards the castle. Snape followed, ensuring he was always a good ways away from the soon to be Dark Lord. Tom didn’t veer off course in any way, he continued straight to Dumbledore’s office, where he waited by the gargoyle.

Snape waited in the corridor outside, content to wait until Tom’s meeting was over. Several minutes ticked by, and the hallways were eerily silent. Suddenly, there was a loud pop! And a bright blue light. When the light dimmed and Severus could see again he saw a woman, dressed in strange clothes. She had a plain white dress on, almost medieval style. It was simple, falling all the way to the ground. The sleeves were long, and angled, hanging several inches longer than Snape thought necessary. Her auburn hair was wrapped around her head in braids, flowers periodically braided in.

“Please!” The woman’s voice cracked as she tried to speak. “H-help me.”

Snape jumped forward, but before he could get to her she collapsed, her arms wrapped around her middle in what he thought was a protective stance. He recoiled as he took her in more detail. Her dress was stained in blood from the waist down; even now some dripped from her legs and pooled at her feet. Her sleeves were splattered in it; she had what appeared as scratches on her upper arms and chest, but now that Severus was looking at her properly he could see they were runes, etched deep enough that it broke the sleeves of her dress and allowed blood to freely drip down. Her hair was ascue, and she had ash on her cheeks as though she had just escaped a fire. All together, his initial assessment was that she had been tortured.

“Help me!” She called again, unaware of his presence. Snape muttered the anticharm for his Disillusionment and stepped into the woman's view. Her eyes snapped to him, and she immediately reached out for him. Snape felt the air leave his lungs the moment her eyes locked onto his. Merlin's beard, this woman looked just like Lily. Snape couldn’t help but freeze, the mountain of emotions burning inside of him. He tried to remind himself that this wasn’t Lily; Lily was dead. The auburn hair was jolting, but more so was the woman’s facial structure - the line of her jaw, the curve of her lips… it mirrored Lily perfectly.

“P-please, sir!”

At her pleas, Snape came forward, unsure of how he could assist this woman. He hesitated, locking eyes with her once more. To his relief, and despair, he realized she had different color eyes. Lily’s eyes were green; this woman’s were amber. Other than the difference in eye color, the comparison was amazing. She had the same facial structure; same hair color as Lily, he had to physically try to steady his own shaking hands. Is this what Lily had looked like in her final moments? Terrified? In pain? He broke the woman’s gaze and scanned her quickly, trying to determine where she was gravely injured. “Where are you hurt?”

“N-no, I’m -” the woman grunted, tightening her grip on a pile of blanket’s Snape hadn’t noticed until that moment. The woman doubled over, obviously in excruciating pain.

“Take her -” The woman unwrapped her arms from the bundle, drawing the top blanket away to reveal a baby, naked. Snape's jaw dropped in shock, looking at the woman as she sunk to her knees, moaning weakly.

“Please! Take her!” the woman begged, offering him her child once more. She was struggling to hold herself up; she was nearly dropping the child so he took the baby bundle from her, crouching down next to her as the woman weakly leaned against the wall. The woman glanced around the dim corridor, looking around as though in fear for her life. Her head whipped around, eyes wide. “This isn’t home.”

“Where is home?” Snape asked immediately, urgently.

The woman glanced hesitantly at him before lifting her shoulders and managing to look slightly more regal, despite the blood splattered on her face and her clammy, pale complexion. “Peverell Manor, of course.”

Snape gasped in shock, gaping at the woman. She ignored his reaction, gesturing instead to the baby he held awkwardly in his arms. “Take her, please… my magic…” The woman started coughing, and on instinct Severus reached for the woman to support her. The woman slid down on the wall until she was virtually laying in his lap, Severus staring down horrifically. The coughs racked the woman’s thin body. When she finally relaxed, she looked up at him and he fell back. Blood coated her mouth and chin, and she was weakly trying to wipe it off.

“Let me get you to a healer!” Severus said, moving so that he was no longer directly underneath the woman.

“Nothing they can do,” the woman shook her head, gesturing weakly to the runes etched into her body. The blood was gushing from them more urgently now, large puddles beginning to pool all around her. “Used all my magic… p-please, don’t let him near us.” She whispered fearfully, eyes wild again.

“Who?” Snape looked around, wand lifted in search of the threat.

“D-dark man,” the young woman whispered, looking up at Snape with her amber eyes. He panicked at her desperation; It was like looking at Lily. “H-he hurt me. He can’t have my baby, please don’t let him have my baby!” She was screaming now, desperately grabbing at Snape’s clothes as he gawked at her in horror. Resolution set in, Snape scowling espite it; he couldn’t have helped Lily, but he could help her.

“He won’t,” Snape assured her, pushing to his feet and surveying the empty hallway for threats one last time. When he saw none he turned back to the woman, dropping on his knees and offering her her child. “Please, let me find you a healer. Someone who can help.”

“N-no,” the woman shook her head firmly. “R-ritual required… a life…” She was about to say more when the moving gargoyle announced the return of Tom. Instantly, Snape cast a DisIllusionment charm, fading them from sight just as the staircase fully descended. He clapped a hand over the woman’s mouth, holding a finger up to his lips to signal her to be quiet. The woman froze, looking fearfully at Snape. Her chest rose and fell quickly, eyes wide. Snape’s eyes followed Tom the moment his figure came into view around the stone gargoyle. Tom strode from the office, anger dancing on his features.

The pair watched him as he turned a sharp right, heading towards the middle of the castle rather than the exit. Snape hesitated, knowing he was supposed to follow Riddle when the woman let out a moan of pain, drawing his attention back to her. He quickly reversed the Disillusionment Charm, fading them back into sight.

“Dark magic… can’t stop him,” The woman moaned, head rolling weakly to look at him.

“What is your name?” Snape prodded her, trying to place the baby in the woman’s arms. The woman was deteriorating quickly, and he was no healer.

“Basilea Peverell,” The woman responded weakly. She looked around the corridor they were in, smiling faintly. “This castle almost looks like my manor.”

Snape merely grunted in response as he summoned towels to wrap the babe in. He set the baby aside and began stripping the towels to try to stop the bleeding. He worked frantically, while mentally his mind spun. The Peverell name was among the first to die out… so that would mean she’s... “What year is it?” he asked abruptly.

The woman’s breathing was shallow, but she managed to hold the baby Severus had placed next to her. He helped her set the baby on her lap as she smiled faintly down at the child before whispering, “1001?” She glanced around, a frown wrinkling her face. “Or that is my time. I do not know what time we are in.”

Snape’s face drained of all color. So she was aware she had time-traveled. She’d done it intentionally. “What are you doing here?”

“Trying to escape,” it sounded as though it was difficult for the woman to piece together sentences. Her voice had become raspy, breath rattling around in her lungs. “Looking for…Albania... didn’t get it… back in time… thought I was going to his time…”

The puzzling words falling from the woman’s mouth made no sense. The baby was starting to fuss, and was slowly slipping from his mother’s arms, so Snape took the baby back in his.“Looking for what?”

The woman didn’t respond. Snape looked down at the squealing, crying baby in his arms and back at the woman. He moved to stand up, so he could scoot closer to the woman when his foot slipped in something. The woman was bleeding still, through the towels.

“No,” Snape murmured, moving the baby to one arm so he could feel the woman’s pulse with the other. It was faint, barely palpable.

“Wake up!” Snape snarled, shaking the woman gently. “You can’t leave your child!”

The woman never regained consciousness. A few seconds later, her pulse had stopped. Snape looked down at the bloody mess around him, and the squealing infant in his arms. Glancing down the hallway where Riddle had disappeared to, and back at the dead woman.

Cursing, Snape stood. He glanced around for a few moments, trying to figure out what he should do. He was about to go after Riddle when his eyes fell on the woman’s body once again. In it’s disheveled state, auburn hair falling in pieces to frame her face. She looked so much like Lily with her eyes closed in death.

Snape gritted his teeth. He couldn’t leave her here. He muttered a scourgify spell that cleaned the blood up, before transfiguring the woman’s body into a Lily flower. He tucked it into his coat pocket, before pulling the time turner Dumbledore had given him from under his shirt.

This woman wasn’t Lily, but she deserved better than what she got. Just like Lily.

Snape was pulled out of the Pensieve, Dumbledore with him. Severus had been too shooken up to attempt to explain what happened, so he’d extracted copies of the memories and given them to Dumbledore.

“Before we do anything else,” Albus said softly as he walked away from the Pensieve. He began to remove the blankets from around the baby in his arms. “Let’s have a look at this young one, shall we?”

The baby cooed as the grey wizard lifted it from it’s warm cocoon. Dumbledore cradled the baby gently in his arms as he spoke softly to it, almost in a fatherly way.

The strength went out of Snape’s body and he sunk into a chair. He buried his face in his hands and cried out. “What have I done?!”

“Severus,” Albus Dumbledore spoke gently, but his voice held an edge. “This isn’t your doing. Something else was at play here.”

Snape exhaled bitterly, racking his brain for the woman’s words. “She spoke of using all her magic.”

“Yes…” Dumbledore mused as he remained fascinated with the child in his arms. “That is peculiar. And her words… what was it she said again? The ‘jumble of nonsense’ I think you called it?”

“She said something about a dark man and he couldn’t get her child.”

“After that, Severus.”

Snape huffed, thinking back to the woman’s words. “Something about Albania and trying to escape. Looking for something… didn’t get it.” Snape thought harder for a moment before adding, “She said ‘back in time’ and then ‘I thought I was going to his time’.”

“Interesting.” Dumbledore remained silent for several long minutes until Snape couldn’t take the silence anymore.

“What do we do? The child doesn’t belong -”

“We don’t know that, Severus.”

Snape stood up in outrage. “The child was born to a mother from hundreds of years ago, to a timeline where her family name no longer exists! Her mere existence is a threat!”

A small smile crinkled the lines around the headmaster’s eyes. “Ah, Severus. So quick to condemn the child. Is it because of the threat to the timeline, or are you against having another child walking around that resembles Lily Potter?”

“Do not speak her name,” Snape snarled at the headmaster, standing immediately to stride towards him. Dumbledore held Snape’s glare with an amused one of his own before turning his attention back to coo at the child in his arms.

The baby in the headmaster’s arms cried, and Snape visibly winced but maintained his icy stare. “This woman… she looked… Professor, she looked like Lily.” Snape looked up at Dumbledore for the first time that night, his eyes bright with tears and longing. “I couldn’t leave her there. I wanted to. But I couldn’t.” Snape threw himself back dejectedly in his chair.

Albus shook his head. “Severus, you knew the risks… but what’s done is done, now.”

“I didn’t complete the mission,” Snape said dejectedly, a hand rising to his brow to massage the worried wrinkles, thinking back to his failure to follow Riddle.

“On the contrary, Severus,” Albus said with a soft smile. “Your memories of your mission might prove more insightful than you anticipate.”

Snape didn’t speak, just focused on the infant in Dumbledore’s arms. Snape’s outburst had startled the child and it was now fussing.The Potion’s Master looked at the child in the headmaster’s arms with mildly concealed hate.

“I couldn’t resist,” Snape repeated softly, staring at the child with disgust. “She was so like her… I couldn’t resist.”

“Basilea Peverell, was her name?”

Snape looked up sharply at the older wizard, his gaze almost wild. “That’s it? No lecture? Punishment? You’re not going to turn me over to the Ministry for breaking about a thousand different Time Laws?”

Albus smiled at the distraught wizard before him, chuckling softly. “Severus…you yourself broke no laws. This is not your offspring; you simply couldn’t leave the child there in an incorrect timeline. Granted, you could have taken her back to her timeline, but it sounded like there was great despair there, so you did the next best thing and brought it here. Children are blessings. I wouldn’t think of turning you over to the Ministry because punishing you, stripping your magic, and throwing you in Azkaban does no good for anyone. Not for me, not for you, and certainly not for this child.”

Snape observed Dumbledore in silence, obviously shocked by his words. A moment later the Slytherin recovered from his shock and answered the headmaster’s question. “I do not know how she got to nearly 840 years into the future; she had no time-turner around her neck, but she was not from the current timeline. You saw for yourself. I did, however, bring it back for you to examine.”

Dumbledore looked up sharply. “You what?”

Snape withdrew the flower from his coat pocket and placed it on the desk before the headmaster. “I transfigured her body; I couldn’t very well leave the body of a bloody, injured  woman dressed as though in the Renaissance, lying in a pool of her own blood in the hallways of Hogwarts, could I?”

Dumbledore seemed to ponder this silently for a moment before speaking slowly. “You have been most useful, Severus. I don’t think this mission is the failure you believe it to be.”

“I brought back a child to the wrong timeline!” Snape bellowed, gesturing to the baby Dumbledore was holding. “Do you not see the catastrophic events that could unfold?”

“Honestly, Severus, how could a witch from nearly 900 years ago possess the ability to transport herself forward in time. Such magic did not exist until it was discovered almost the mid 1500’s. Something else is at play here. Someone else had tampered with this woman’s timeline already, and we are not going to place blame on you, or this child.” Albus spoke firmly.

“I could take her back.” Snape said weakly. “To her mother’s time.”

“No,” Albus shook his head. “I believe Miss Peverell spoke of a man attempting to hurt her. Someone would not flee into the future on a whim.”

“What do we do?” Snape’s voice was broken, reflecting the shell of a man that now resided in his body.

Albus looked shocked at the question. “We will run tests on the child, to confirm it’s maternity and paternity to see if we can gather any additional information on the child’s parentage.” The headmaster paused, looking down his nose at the Professor sitting across from him. “Unless of course, you have information on the mother you could divulge?”

“No,” Severus shook his head dejectedly. “Everything I know about her is in the memories I gave you.”

“I guess all that remains is to determine what to do with the child.” Ablus glanced up at the Slytherin man before him. “Am I too forward to assume you might take responsibility for the girl?”

Snape almost fell out of his chair in shock. “I can’t raise that child.” Snape’s voice carried throughout the entire study, the shock obvious.

“You had sympathy for the child; I thought you might want to continue the responsibility.”

“It will look like… her.” Snape's voice was taunt. “I know it’s mother is not Lily, but she looked so much like her it was uncanny. I cannot bear to see another child that looks like her when she is not here.”

Dumbledore regarded the man silently, if not a little disappointedly. “Then what would you do with the child, Severus?”

“What of the damage to the time-line?” Snape asked desperately. “Does it not endanger the future to have her here, interacting?”

Dumbledore scratched his beard, weighing Snape's words before he spoke cautiously. “Time is a fickle, and fluent thing. Who is to say she is not entitled to this timeline just because she was brought here? Or perhaps the timeline of her mother? But what of her father’s timeline? Clearly someone else has tampered here; who is to say her father isn’t from this timeline? There are too many options for this child, but for now, this one is the safest for her. Trust me, Severus, I will be looking into it a great deal more, but we are not going to inflict judgment onto this child; her presence here is a blessing, not a burden.” Dumbledore seemed to finish his rant before fixing Snape with an emotionless stare. “I ask you again, Severus, what would you do with the child if you can’t raise it yourself?”

“You take it,” Snape spat bitterly, rising to his feet. “You seem to have taken a liking to it. Better you to take the child as your ward then for me to raise it as mine.”

“You would have me raise the child?” Dumbledore seemed rather amused by this idea, and pondered it for a moment.

Snape stood silently, waiting for the headmaster's decision.

“Fine, Severus. It shall be as you wish.”

With that Snape spun to  leave the room, the sound of his robes swishing behind him.

“It’s a girl,” Dumbledore called out at his retreating back. “Do you have a preference for a name?”

Snape paused, his back still to the headmaster. “Anything but Lily.”

"But Albus!" Dahlia Dumbledore stormed around the headmaster's office, waving her hands around angrily. She had grown into a pretty girl, having just celebrated fifteen years as his ward. She'd inherited her mother's looks, except her hair was dark, falling in ringlets past her shoulders."I want to attend Hogwarts, not just live hidden here!"Dumbledore observed his ward fondly, curious at her outbreak. She was usually a calm, reserved child. "There is too much at stake; if anyone - student or professor - were to find out about your... abilities... it would cause questions that we cannot answer."Dahlia whirled about, anger flashing in her amber eyes. The magic in the room crackled to life, springing to the tips of her fingers. "Cannot answer? Or won't?" She challenged, glaring indignantly at her guardianDumbledore opened his mouth to speak, but his ward cut him off again. Her usually tame hair was wild today, dark loose curls pointing at odd angles. Her amber eyes flashed dangerously. The perfect image of her mother - except for her hair - but she didn't know that."I cannot live my life hidden in the castle, Albus. It is more suspicious for me to remain hidden than it does for me to join classes as any other student!" Dahlia's amber eyes were filled with tears as she spoke with conviction. "Do you know how hard it has been for me to stay locked away the past three years with Harry Potter and his friends running around? How long honestly do you think until he finds out about the Room of Requirement? What other prison will you come up with to lock me in?" She threw herself into a chair at the end of her outburst, crossing her arms over her chest and glaring at the older wizard in front of her. Tears threatened to spring into her eyes but she fought them back.Albus said nothing, just observed the young witch in front of him. She had grown into a beautiful young woman at fifteen. He had raised her as his ward, and as she grew older he began to notice certain... abilities she possessed that were stronger than the typical witch or wizard. Dumbledore thought back to the time Madam Hooch had taken her to the quidditch field one night about a year ago. Dahlia had fallen from her broom, but much to the surprise of himself and Madam Hooch she continued to fly... without a broom in a way known only to a few select wizards. Dumbledore's brow wrinkled at the thought. The ability to fly, without magic devices, was extremely difficult to master. Something that should be well beyond the ability of what would have been a third year student. What concerned him most was one day he had taken her on an excursion when she was eight, and she was resting under a tree. She lay on her stomach, her feet swinging in the air as her chin rested on her hands. When Albus approached her, he saw that she seemed to be having a conversation, only he couldn't see who it was. As he drew nearer, he noticed a Maledictus curled before her, it's head lifted. Albus's first instinct was to run for the child. Maledicti were known for their vicious behavior, as well as their dangerous venum. Before he could reach Dahlia, however, he realized that Dahlia was conversing with the snake. He had strained his ears trying to hear her words, but all that reached his ears was raspes. Until it hit him: She was speaking parseltongue.Ever since that day, Dumbledore had made sure he had taken the young girl under his wing for all magic supervision. He'd found extreme brilliance in her mind, and her powers far out matched that of her peers. Those situations, combined with other strange things that had occurred through the years had him nervous to allow her to join a class of her peers; especially with the complicated situation of her birth."Well?" His young ward's voice broke him out of his reverie. "May I take classes?"Dumbledore tapped his fingers against his desk for a moment before speaking slowly. She was right on one aspect; he couldn't keep her locked away for her entire life. She had shown extreme reserve and control this past year, and with her unknowing her past she would likely blend in with the other students, therefore maintaining the -"Albus!"Dumbledore huffed, raising his eyes to quirk his brow at the young witch in front of him. "You may attend classes -"Dahlia squealed, rising from the chair to throw her arms around the headmaster's neck. Dumbledore embraced her for a moment, before setting her back from him to look her in the eyes."No one must know the extent of your powers. You are more powerful than any witch or wizard I have seen come through Hogwarts; myself included. We must not give anyone any reason to investigate you.""I won't! I'll make sure I keep it under control." Dahlia threw her arms around his neck again, squealing. "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"Dumbledore patted her back kindly. "We will need to get you books and robes then."Dahlia pulled back, face lit up with excitement. She jumped up and down, hands clapping. "Does this mean I finally get to go to Diagon Alley?""Ms. Dumbledore!" Dahlia paused, uncomfortable at the use of her surname. She had grown up as Dumbledore's ward, and therefore had taken his surname as a child. However, since her true paternity was unknown, she preferred to just be called by her first name. Considering her main companions were Dumbledore or the houselves, she had never had to answer to her last name before."Yes?" Dahlia looked down the corridor behind her to find a professor scurrying towards her. The woman was tall, hair pulled back in a tight bun at the nape of her neck."I'm Professor McGonagall; Professor Dumbledore sent me to fetch you for the sorting ceremony.""Oh," Dahlia nodded warily, "I was just told to wait here until someone came for me." The butterflies in her stomach were becoming unnerving, and she felt bile rising in her throat."Yes, well," Professor McGonagall peered down her spectacles at the young witch in front of her. She was a stern looking witch who looked to be in her 50's. She had a no nonsense air about her, and a gaze that left Dahlia feeling as though the woman had seen her deepest secrets. "Dumbledore has appraised me to your unique situation. If you will follow me please," and with that the professor breezed by her.Dahlia pondered for a moment exactly what about her "unique situation" Dumbledore had told her, but Professor McGonagall didn't wait for Dahlia to follow. Dahlia stumbled after her a moment later, following the professor into the Great Hall. She had been brought out through the entrance behind the teacher's table, not the great front doors like the first years which could be seen shuffling in, drawing most of the room's attention."Furthermore, this year, before we get on with the sorting, we have a new student!" Professor Dumbledore's voice boomed over the silence of the great hall. He must have just finished his speech. McGonagall gently nudged Dahlia forward, and she took a few hesitant steps towards the headmaster.Dahlia kept her eyes forward, focused on Dumbledore as her feet moved slowly across the floor. Her feet felt like they were made of lead, and her heart was pounding in her chest. She felt the hundreds of pairs of eyes watching her as she crossed the stage."Dahlia Dumbledore, has been studying abroad, and has decided to transfer here for the remainder of her magical study!" Dumbeldore turned to her, and kindly gestured her to his side. Dahlia accepted the hand he reached out to her as he affectionately smiled down at her. She returned his smile, thankful to have somewhere else to look than the hundreds of eyes staring at her.The Great Hall erupted in whispers as the students talked amongst themselves. No doubt caused by her last name, as everyone knew Dumbledore had remained unmarried and childless. They were also probably curious as to why Dumbledore would send her abroad to study, when he was the headmaster of one of the finest wizarding schools already.Dumbeldore and Dahlia had crafted the lie the night before; deciding that it would be better to have attended a school abroad than to have been untrained for years. Of course, with Dumbledore as a guardian she was not untrained. The headmaster had spent hours with her, training her in defensive and offensive magic, as well as transfiguration and potions. The only subject the professor had lacked in teaching was Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures, all of which Dahlia was ecstatic about taking at Hogwarts. Dumbledore had allowed her access to his own collection of books, so she had educated herself as best as she could on the subjects.The Great Hall was still alive with quiet murmurs and gossip. Dahlia winced, knowing the curious stares and questions she would get later. Mentally she shook herself. Now wasn't the time; that was a later issue. Right now she needed to get through her sorting.Dumbledore raised his hand, and instantly the Great Hall fell silent. "We will go ahead and sort Dahlia into her house first, and then proceed with the usual sorting."That was Dahlia's cue to take the stool in front of the podium. She wobbled towards the stool, hoping none of the students could see how shaky her legs had become. She collapsed on the stool with relief, and waited as Professor McGonagall placed the old sorting hat on her head.It went dark; the hat drooping below her eyes. The darkness that enveloped her calmed her, making it seem as though it was only her in the room and not hundreds of students watching. It was silent for a moment and then a quiet voice in her ear spoke."Hmmmm, interesting, interesting," the voice was so quiet it was almost a whisper, but she could hear it clear as day. Dahlia tensed, ready for the judgment to be made."Your father's blood runs strong... yes, yes. Cunning, brave... not a bad lust for power either. You'd make a good Slytherin."Her body froze, and the cold panic she expected to rush over her never did. Dahlia had never been opposed to being in one house or the other; she had just simply desired to be attending Hogwarts. Living in Hogwarts her whole life she had picked up on many negative things about the Slytherins; especially their tendency to support whatever Dark Wizard was in power but the idea of being placed there she had always thought would bring a sense of dread, but none came."However, your mother's blood... how interesting. Predestined for two houses, aren't you?"Predestined for two houses? What does that mean, Dahlia thought, hoping the hat could hear her thoughts."Ancestor of the Savior; child of the Dark one, who is to say where you belong? The mark of two founders, the sign of the prophecy child, you are darkness and light... I supposed since I cannot choose you must."I must choose what? Dahlia thought back to the hat, his riddles playing over and over again in her head. What do you mean by my mother's blood?"Choose your house, United One. Gryffindor will offer your bravery and nobility, and friends with loyalty unwavered. Slytherin will show you power, teach you cunning, resourcefulness, and will give you the ambition to be all you desire. Choose your destiny."Her whole life she had lived, locked up in the room of requirement. Dahlia was allowed to prowl the castle, of course. Only at night, once the students and faculty had gone to bed. Her only friends had been Albus, and the house elves that took care of her. She'd always been so... alone. At that moment, she made her decision.Gryffindor. She thought with certainty. I'm done being alone. Unwavering loyalty sounded good to her."Better be, GRYFFINDOR!" The hat's voice magnified, expanding past her ear to reach the entire hall. The hat was lifted off of her head, and she rose from the stool, a smile on her face. She was shocked by the sight before her. She hadn't dared look up at the sea of students prior to her sorting, and she was now glad she hadn't. Hundreds of curious eyes were looking at her, the students separated into four huge, room-length tables.Her thoughts were still spinning from the words the sorting hat had spoken as she propelled herself towards the table on the far left that had erupted into cheers. A crimson flag of a lion hung over the table, students representing their house colors of crimson and gold. As she approached the table people were shaking her hand, patting her back, and introducing themselves, smiling at her curiously.Dahlia smiled as she greeted them all, doing her best to remember everyone's names. Faces all blurred together until she finally came to a stop at an empty spot on the bench. taking her seat next to a curly headed girl with a book."Hi, I'm Hermione." The girl turned to Dahlia, smiling softly. She closed the book in her lap, giving Dahlia a sincere, friendly look."Dahlia, nice to meet you." Dahlia shyly returned her smile as she slid her legs in beside the girl."You, too!" The other witch regarded Dahlia with curiosity. "Did the headmaster say your last name is Dumbledore?"And so it begins, Dahlia thought as she plastered a fake smile on her face. "Yes, that's right.""You're Dumbledore's daughter?!" Hermione's voice reached near shriek level.Dahlia's face lit up in embarrassment as she ducked her head. "Keep your voice down!"A guilty look flashed across Hermione's face as she furgitively looked around to see who had overheard her. A few students were regarding the two of them curiously, but no one seemed to have heard."I'm his ward," Dahlia explained in a hushed whisper. "I was left on the steps of Hogwarts as a baby, and Albus took me in.""Oh!" Hermione instantly looked embarrassed and guilty for starting the conversation. "I... I am so sorry. I had no idea."Dahlia brushed her off with a smile and patted her hand kindly. "It's not that big of a deal. It's just something I don't like people knowing."Hermione nodded understandingly. "I won't speak of it; I swear."Dahlia let out a small sigh of relief. Hermione seemed nice enough; maybe this could be the start of a friendship. "Thank you.""Tell me all about studying abroad." Hermione turned to engage more fully with Dahlia, and dinner passed quickly as the two became quick friends. Once, Dahlia caught Dumbledore's eyes and received a questioning look. Dahlia withered under his glance for a second, her heart racing. Could he have heard the sorting hat?"Hermione," Dahlia whispered to her new friend as a Ministry of Magic employee began to discuss the rules for a tournament Hogwarts was hosting this year. "Can everyone hear what the sorting hat says during the sorting?"Hermione turned in surprise. "No, of course not! Whatever the sorting hat says while he is deciding where to sort you is private; no one else hears anything until he announces which house.""Oh," Dahlia sagged in relief. Another thought crossed her mind, and she hesitantly spoke again. "You said the sorting hat chooses... does he normally give people a choice?"Hermione looked at the new Gryffindor beside her. "Well... it's not unheard of.""It's not?" Dahlia tried not to sound desperate."No, it happened to me." A male voice from Dahlia's right startled her. She turned to find green eyes that look similar to hers staring back at her. For half a second Dahlia processed the scar on his forehead, the glasses resting on his face, and the dark unruly hair before she realized she was looking at Harry Potter."It...what?" Dahlia seemed lost for words."The sorting hat," Potter prompted, sitting down next to her. "I heard you talking to Hermione, asking if it gives you a choice.""The sorting hat gave you a choice?" Dahlia's eyes grew wide with relief to hear she wasn't the only one."Well, sort of. It never actually said "You have to choose". The hat wanted to place me in Slytherin, but I didn't want Slytherin. I asked for anywhere but Slytherin, so the hat decided to choose Gryffindor."Since I cannot choose, you must.The sorting hat's words echoed through her mind. While the hat had taken Harry's choice into consideration, Dahlia had been given a choice. The feeling that that had not happened before was gnawing at her, but she remained silent. No need to give anyone else another reason to think she was different other than the fact she was Dumbledore's ward.Dahlia barely heard a thing the Ministry official was saying about the Triwizard tournament. They announced the arrival of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students, here for the year to participate. The whole time she avoided her guardian's curious gaze, wondering if somehow he had heard the choice the hat had given her.After dinner the houses were dismissed to their common rooms, but before Dahlia could slip away with the rest of her fellow Gryffindors Dumbledore stopped her."A moment, Ms. Dumbledore?" The headmaster spoke formally. They had agreed to keep their relationship as professor and student while in front of students and faculty."Yes, headmaster?"Dumbledore waited a moment as the last few students filed from the Great Hall. When only a handful of students remained her guardian leaned down and murmured in her ear. "You chose well."Dahlia's heart jumped, realizing the headmaster had indeed heard the sorting hat's words. "Alb - Professor, what d-""Not here, Dahlia," the headmaster's voice turned harsh, warning her that this was not the place. "We will speak later.""Okay," Dahlia nodded numbly as Dumbledore stepped away from her, leaving her alone in the Great Hall. She paused for a moment, tightening the strap on her bag around her shoulder. She just realized that for the first time she didn't know where the Gryffindor common room was."Lost?" A snooty voice rang out from behind her. Dahlia turned to find a pale boy, with beautiful grey eyes and platinum hair approaching her. She observed him for a moment, noting the way he carried himself with a careless manner. His voice was haughty, as though used to having everything handed to him. His face was regal, but beautiful. She had to jerk her attention away from his face, a slight blush tinging her cheeks."No... well, yes," Dahlia decided it was best to just admit she needed help finding her common room."I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy." The blonde stuck out his hand to her, and she took it hesitantly. His hand was larger than hers, but soft. It enveloped hers in a warm embrace, that was cut short when he hastily removed his hand from her grip."Dahlia," the witch answered simply, falling in step next to the wizard."You got sorted into Gryffindor, right?" The disgust in his voice was barely hidden."Yes," Dahlia said, mentally correcting him to chose Gryffindor."Not much for you in Gryffindor, but I suppose you'll find that out on your own. Potter's got the whole house wrapped around his finger. Blood traitors and mudbloods, the whole lot of them," the blonde spoke hatefully. Dahlia's own temper flared at the boy's harsh words."I met Potter and his friends at dinner, and they seemed more kind than some people. But, then again, I don't base my friendships based on blood status."" Dahlia shot back at him, regretting her decision to walk with him to her dormitory. Being raised by Dumbledore had left little room for judgements, blood purity and status being something left out of her curriculum. She knew the discord it brought on the wizarding world, some viewing muggle-borns as unworthy, others accepting."I'm a pureblood," Draco boasted proudly, seemingly unaffected by her sharp words. "Got a long history of wizards in my family. What about you?"Dahlia felt her lip curl into a sneer worthy of the Slytherin next to her. "I don't know."The boy next to her shot her a sharp glance. "What do you mean you don't know? Aren't you Dumbledore's daughter?"Ahh, there it was again. The real reason he had offered to help her find the Gryffindor common room. He wanted to interrogate the headmaster's daughter.Dahlia's nostrils flared as she exhaled sharply, spinning to face him. "I hate to disappoint, but actually, I'm not his daughter, I'm his ward. I was abandoned as a baby and Albus took me in. I haven't got the slightest clue who my birth parents are, nor about my blood status."Malfoy didn't respond to her, just simply continued walking in silence. Dahlia felt a slight surge of pride at having shut up the Slytherin boy, but her joy was short-lived."You should be in Slytherin," Malfoy drawled as they turned a corner."How should you know where I belong?" Dahlia retorted, not forgetting his unkind words about her housemates moments before.Malfoy seemed taken back by her attitude, but recovered quickly. "I just figured with you being new here and all, joining late would be hard on you. You'll need friends."Dahlia stopped walking, and looked at the handsome boy beside her. "Is this your way of offering to be my friend?"Malfoy didn't seem to know what to respond, his jaw opening and closing. "No, I was simply trying to warn you to not make the wrong friends."Dahlia rolled her eyes. "I'm perfectly capable of making those decisions for myself, thank you very much."Malfoy took her answer in silence, his legs quickening their pace. Dahlia found herself trotting to keep up. Her companion walked alongside her in silence, looking straight ahead. An amused smile tugged at the corners of Dahlia's mouth. Malfoy... they were a Slytherin family; an ancient pureblood family that could be traced back centuries. No wonder he was so haughty and pompous. He was probably heir to a fortune and name that would guarantee him anything he wanted for the rest of his days. Despite his haughty manner and rude words, Dahlia felt a draw to him. He was... a puzzle. He intrigued her, so she followed the Slytherin through the corridors and up to a tower until they came to a stop abruptly in front of a large painting."This is your common room." The Slytherin boy turned to smirk at her, finding amusement in her confused look. "I'll leave you to you new friends." He sneered the last words, his lips curling into a sarcastic smile.Dahlia tried to keep the smirk off her face as she watched his retreating back. "Malfoy?"The Slytherin paused, his back to her."If you wanted to be my friend, all you had to do was ask."The Slytherin disappeared without another word, and Dahlia was stuck outside the common room without the password.

Dahlia was settling into life at Hogwarts. The castle was huge, and it quickly became apparent to her that while she might have roamed the castle at night it was clear she hadn't roamed the entire thing. She easily got lost ten times her first week of classes, and if it hadn't been for Hermione and her new Gryffindor friends she would have missed several classes.Dahlia was learning that she had an aptitude for Transfiguration and Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professors Moody and McGonagall were impressed by her wand work, and spell mastery. Even Hermione Granger had a hard time matching her performance and grades in those two classes. Charms she found she was decent at, but lacked interest in. She was still easily near the top of the class, much to Hermione's dissatisfaction. However, in potions she was unmatched. It became obvious to Professor Snape that fourth year potions were a breeze for the young witch. He responded in kind by assigning her more difficult potions, or requiring her to make the potion after having only read the instructions twice. The professor rarely had anything to criticize on her potions work, however. Despite his raising the difficulty, Dahlia always managed to complete the potion he'd given her to perfection. He'd recently taken to rarely speaking anything to her at all.Today, however, was the day Dahlia had been waiting for. After double potions in the morning they had Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures. They were into their second week of school, but those classes had been cancelled for the first week due to weather and an overly aggressive venomous tentacula."Aren't you excited for Care of Magical Creatures?" Dahlia sang as she dug into her lunch. Hermione was sitting next to her, looking hesitant to pop the excited girl's bubble."Er... you have met Hagrid before, right?"Dahlia nodded, her mouth full of food. "Yeah! I met him with you and Harry last week!""Yes, well, he'll be the professor...""Brilliant!" Dahlia nodded enthusiastically. "I've never taken a Care of Magical Creature's course before so I can't wait!"Hermione beamed at Dahlia not only for her excitement, but for her non judgment over Hagrid. "Yes, well, I'm sure the class will be interesting! Just... sometimes it's a little... er... well, dangerous."Dahlia brushed her hand through the air. "I've been waiting my whole life to take a Care of Magical Creatures class. I could die in the class for all I care, and it'll still be brilliant."Hermione laughed at Dahlia's words. "Well, don't say I didn't warn you."Dahlia laughed Hermione's words away as she continued to eat. She didn't see the odd expression that crossed Hermione's face as she leaned towards Dahlia."You mean, you've never taken a Care of Magical Creature's course before? But they're required at Beauxbatons, Hogwarts, and Durmstrang once a student enters third year!"Dahlia tried to hide her wince as she mentally scrambled to come up with an answer that wouldn't blow her cover. Outwardly she smiled and shrugged, inwardly she clawed at strings trying to come up with an adequate answer. "I wasn't at Beauxbatons or Durmstrang."There, simple answer. As long as Hermione didn't push the subject, that should be fine."Oh," Hermione's face fell, then lifted again with curiosity. "Where were you then?"Dahlia shrugged, giving her the only answer she could come up with. "A smaller, private school.""Oh, I didn't realize wizards had private schools."Dahlia inwardly praised herself. Hermione was muggle-born, which meant that she was still learning and adjusting to the wizarding ways, so hopefully she would just accept those answers."What made you want to come to Hogwarts?" Hermione asked another question as she began to eat.Finally a question that she wouldn't have to lie about. Dahlia gave Hermione a genuine smile as she said, "I always wanted to go to Hogwarts. Dumbledore sent me away young, but all I could think about was coming here. It took a few years to convince him, but I finally did it."Their conversation turned to life abroad in other countries. Hermione had done a great bit of travel with her parents over the summers the past few years, and Dahlia was more than happy to sit back and listen to her experiences."Are Harry and Ron meeting us down there?" Dahlia as Hermione as they headed down the grounds towards Hagrid's shack."Yes," Hermione confirmed. "Harry and Ron wanted to see if Fred and George were able to make it past the age line Dumbledore drew."Dahlia snorted, her shoulders shaking at the thought. "Those two honestly think they're going to outsmart Dumbledore's age line?"Hermione giggled as well, nodding her head. "I told them, but they'll find out for themselves."The girls made quick work of the walk down to Hagrid's. They arrived a few minutes before class started, with Ron and Harry running in at the last second."It was brilliant!" Ron wheezed to the girls as he skidded to a stop in front of them.Hermione's eyes flew open wide. "You mean they actually did it?"Harry cracked up laughing. "Merlin, no. They got thrown out of the ring with beards that could rival Dumbledore's!"That mental image sent Dahlia rolling on the ground. Hermione joined her, both of them laughing until their sides ached. Dahlia rose from the ground with a hand from Ron, wiping the tears out of her eyes."I told them it wouldn't work!" Hermione said weakly as she caught her breath from laughing.The four turned back to face Hagrid who was beginning class, but movement by the back caught Dahlia's eye. To her surprise it was Malfoy. She hadn't had a run-in with him since the night of her sorting. He was in Potions with her, and Defense Against the Dark Arts as well, but he had avoided her. A couple times a class she would glance over at him, and he would be fixedly staring at his parchment or the professor.She knew he would look at her though. She could feel his eyes on her a couple times a class, leaving her confused. Part of her was glad Malfoy steered clear; the stories her new friends had told her about Malfoy was more than enough evidence to prove he wasn't the kind of guy she needed to be around. But yet, she couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to him than the haughty, spoiled exterior he presented himself as. After all, it hadn't truly been him that opened the Chamber of Secrets in second year - as much as an asshole as he sounded.Dahlia was jerked from her thoughts when Malfoy lifted his eyes, and met her stare. His grey eyes widened in surprise at catching him looking at her, and he quickly jerked his gaze away. A pale pink flush tainted his cheeks, and Dahlia turned away, a small smile on her lips."Alright, e'rybody! Follow me!" Hagrid's voice boomed out over the group of fourth years, and they obediently followed him down a path towards the forest."We aren't going into the forest!?"Dahlia stifled a snort when she realized it was Malfoy who had spoken, and he sounded almost... scared."Scared, Malfoy?" Dahlia turned, her eyebrows raised. Her words issued a challenge; Malfoy met her gaze defiantly, his features going taunt. He flashed her one of his prize sneers as he growled out, "No, the forest is just off limits to students.""Not when accompanied by a teacher, remember, Malfoy?" It was Ron who spoke this time, his voice echoing a challenge. Dahlia glanced between the Gryffindor and Slytherin, wondering what story laid behind those words. Malfoy tensed up, his face twisted into a scowl as he took a threatening step towards Ron, wand clenched in his hand."That's enough," Hagrid's gruff words silenced any retort Malfoy had been about to speak. Instead, the blond ground his teeth and gave Dahlia a look that made her certain she would regret her words later.The rest of the lesson passed without incident. Malfoy would still throw scowls and death looks towards Dahlia and Ron, but neither side provoked the other again. At the end of the lesson Dahlia was walking up to the castle with Neville; Hermione and Ron had scampered off to another class and Harry was headed to Quidditch.Dahlia and Neville had Herbology next, and were chatting amicably about Snape's horrible potion homework on their way to the greenhouses when a shout behind them drew their attention."Dumbledore!" Malfoy was walking quickly, his hands clenched by his sides as he tried to catch up to her. His anger was visible, grey eyes flashing venomously.Dahlia froze, turning to give the Slytherin boy a cold look. "I prefer to go by Dahlia.""What's your problem?" Malfoy demanded as he stomped in front of her.Dahlia raised her brows at him, sharing a look with Neville. "I really don't know what you're talking about, but I have to get to Herbology."Malfoy sneered at her. "You really think you can insult me and then just walk away?"Dahlia shrugged, grabbing Neville by his arm and turning their backs to him. "Watch me."Neville looked at Dahlia in pure shock as she gripped his arm and marched them away from the stunned Slytherin boy behind them. Dahlia quickened their pace until they were well out of sight of the handsome blonde boy before releasing Neville's arm."Sorry," Dahlia winced when she realized how tight she had been gripping his arm."Don't worry about it!" Neville exclaimed. "That was brilliant!"Dahlia looked at him questioningly. "What was brilliant?""You and Malfoy! I don't know what you did to piss him off, but I've never seen someone stand up to him like that!" Neville blabbed on giddily. "Well, except for Harry," He amended quickly.Dahlia offered him a small smile. "Thanks, Neville."The tall boy held the door for her as they entered the green house for their next class. Dahlia found herself enjoying Herbology even more than Care of Magical Creatures, and was disappointed to find class drawing to an end much too soon.Professor Sprout reminded the class of their homework, and then bid them good day. Dahlia was heading to the common room alone when she bumped into Harry."Hey, Dahlia," Potter greeted her as he fell in step next to her. "How was herbology?""Decent. Hey, what was that thing that Ron said to Malfoy about earlier?" Dahlia was hesitant to ask, but figured the worst she could be told was to mind her business."Oh," Harry shrugged, seeming a little surprised at her question. "I forget you weren't here with us the first year. Our first year me, Hermione, Ron, and Malfoy all got detention one night. We were sent to the Forbidden Forest with Hagrid, where we bumped into Voldemort, in a weird half form trying to stay alive."Dahlia looked at him in shock. Voldemort had been here? On the grounds? And Dumbledore had never spoken to her about it? She managed to keep her face a mask as calm as she expressed her surprise. "Oh, I didn't know! That's scary."Harry shrugged. "The rest of us got over it; I guess it just stuck with Malfoy. You should have seen him when we had to go to the forest last year for our hippogriff lessons."Dahlia nodded as though understanding his words. "Do I even want to know?"Harry laughed as they neared the common room. "Probably not, but you should totally ask Malfoy."Dahlia shrugged, trying to look nonchalant as she spoke. "I don't think he likes me."Another laugh. "Yeah, well, no one really likes him and he really doesn't like anyone."Dahlia glanced at the young wizard next to her. "Why?"Harry stopped walking to grab Dahlia by the shoulders. "Look, you're my friend, and you make your own choices. Just hear me when I say Draco Malfoy is trouble. He always has been rotten, and he won't be good for you. Whatever your interest in him is, I suggest getting over it quickly."Dahlia brushed Harry's hands off her shoulders as she pieced her mask of calm back together. "I don't have an interest in him. I just simply was curious as to why he might have it out for me."Harry regarded her curiously, but accepted her half-assed lie. "It's probably because you're friends with me, Ron, and Hermione. He hates us."She offered him a smile as we entered the common room. "Must be because he doesn't know you guys."Harry snorted, but smiled at her anyways. "Yeah, well, I gotta get ready for dinner. See you there?""Sure will!"Dinner tonight was the talk of the school. Tonight was the night that the champions for the triwizard tournament would be chosen, and everyone of age was hoping for the chance to compete. Dahlia didn't find it all that interesting; a tournament to win eternal glory but you'll probably die? No thanks. She continued calmly eating as she observed the Great Hall around her. Rather than adding additional tables for the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students the four tables in the great hall had simply been expanded to accommodate extra students.The tables were still divided by houses for Hogwarts, but the foreign students mingled and sat where they pleased."Has it always been like this?" Dahlia asked Ron, surveying the segregation. "Do students never sit at other house's tables?"Ron shrugged as he shoveled shepherd pie into his mouth. "Dunno. Why sit anywhere else?"Dahlia chose not to pursue the conversation, instead turning her attention to a particularly lonely blonde boy sitting at the Slytherin table. He was surrounded by fellow fourth years which Dahlia now recognized as Blaise Zabini, Crabbe, Goyle, and the Slytherin whore Pansy Parkinson. Dahlia's lips turned in a sneer worthy of Slytherin as she watched the girl dramatically throwing herself at Malfoy who showed no interest.Malfoy's eyes met hers, and for half a second he looked pleased to catch her looking at him before his face returned to cold stone and he turned away.Huffing at his confusing behavior Dahlia turned to the front of the Great Hall as the choosing began for the TriWizard Tournament. It had been all anyone could talk about. The new rules set in place infuriated most underage students, Dahlia found herself slightly relieved about not having to enter. She was content in her studies, adapting to normal life at Hogwarts quite contentedly. Harry shared her thoughts, having told her how he wanted a normal year at Hogwarts for once, so he was thankful for the age restrictions.The Beauxbatons and Durmstrang schools were chosen first, producing two champions.Viktor Krum, to no one's surprise, was chosen as Durmstrang's champion; A tall, petite French girl named Fleur Delacour was chosen as the Beauxbatons champion. The girl was beautiful, but Dahlia sensed Veela magic in her - she certainly had almost all the men in the room gawking at her. The Hogwarts champion was Cedric Diggory, a seventh year Hufflepuff who was dashingly handsome. Dahlia starred as the champion made his way to the back of the Great Hall. How had she not seen him around the hallways before?"He's taking super advanced classes," Hermione whispered to her. "If you're wondering why you haven't seen him in the halls."Dahlia's cheeks blushed at how Hermione had read her innermost thoughts. She chose to take this information in silence. Thankfully a second later, Dumbledore began to speak, but before the headmaster could launch into his speech, the TriWizard's cup behind him erupted into blue flames again. Albus whirled around just in time to grab the parchment as it fluttered through the air. The entire Great hall stared in confusion, shocked in silence as Dumbledore unfolded the singed paper, scanning the words written."Harry Potter!"The Great Hall went silent as Harry Potter's name was read. Dahlia stared in shock with the rest of her house as Harry shakily stood up, glancing to Hemrione and Ron in desperation. Both were too shocked to speak, gaping in horror. The Chosen One was escorted back to the room with the champions by two aurors as Dahlia's mind spun. There's no way Harry put his name in the cup. Just yesterday he had talked to her about how he didn't want to be in the spotlight anymore than being the Chosen One had already forced him to be. He'd told her how he didn't want to compete in a tournament to the death when he had a prophecy that already forced him into it."He didn't put his name in the cup, though!" Dahlia argued, grabbing Hermione's arm, half standing up. Her words caught a few people's attention. "He didn't want to compete!"Her voice was louder than intended, and it rang through the halls. Dahlia slapped a hand over her mouth when she realized the entire Great Hall had heard, and was now staring at her. She dropped back down into her seat, looking embarrassed but defiant nonetheless. Harry froze on his way out of the Great Hall as though hearing her defend him but continued walking.A second later the tables erupted in protests; underage wizards furious at not having a chance at glory. Beauxbatons and Durmstrang were furious that Hogwarts had two champions. In the midst of it all Dahlia slumped down in her seat, looking miserably at Hermione who looked as confused as she felt."What happens now?" Hermione whispered, her eyes wide."I don't know."Malfoy was waiting in a hidden corridor outside the Great Hall. He hadn't seen the Dumbledore girl leave yet, so he stayed hidden in the shadows, biding his time. The last two weeks he hadn't been able to get her out of his head.That first night of school, her sorting, he had seen her before Dumbledore had introduced her. He watched as she emerged from the door behind the teachers table, looking nervous and anxious. Her hair was as black as night, and it fell in soft curls down her back. She wasn't tall, probably only came up to his shoulders. Watching her make her way across the stage, Draco had been mesmerized by her beauty, and found himself praying she would get sorted into Slytherin. He was so focused on her that he barely registered Dumbledore announcing her name.Dahlia Dumbledore. The shock of that brought him back to reality, and he observed the girl in a new light. She looked nothing like the headmaster, her amber eyes flickering colors apparent even from this distance away. The headmaster had blue eyes, and as far as the world knew, had never been married. So how does he have a daughter?Despair ripped through Malfoy when he realized that as Dumbledore's daughter he would not be permitted anywhere near the girl - by his family, or by hers. This only fueled his need for her to be placed in Slytherin more. She couldn't avoid him if they shared the same house.The seconds had never ticked by slowly as they did when the hat was on her head. Malfoy wondered what could possibly be taking so long; the hat had sat on his head for barely a second before pronouncing him a Slytherin.When the hat announced her for Gryffindor, white hot rage had shot through Malfoy. Gryffindor. She would quickly become one of Potter's blood traitor groups, and then would never give him a second look. Anger spiked through him at that thought, and he silently cursed the girl. Despite knowing that there would be an instilled hatred between them, Malfoy couldn't resist the urge to talk to her so he waited that night to walk her to her common room. It was pure luck she didn't know where to go, and lucky enough he had only gotten lost once on the way there. As they had walked he had tried to initiate himself as her friend, but she seemed to take his advances as insults."You're Dumbledore's daughter, right?" The words had fallen from his lips before he could think twice. Her response had shocked him, the fire in her burned bright and it made him want her more. She wasn't Dumbledore's daughter, only his ward. Inwardly Malfoy sang at that. Perhaps the hatred wouldn't be as deep seated. However, their conversation turned sour once again before he deposited her in front of the Gryffindor common room.Of course she agreed with the blood traitors and mudbloods. She probably deserved to be in Gryffindor. Malfoy had sworn to distance himself and push her away; she didn't even know her blood status. She was Dumbledore' ward, for Merlin's sake. His parents expect him to do much better than that. He was Draco Malfoy, the destined Heir to the Malfoy Estate and Lord of the Manor. His friends were purebloods who's family lines date back centuries, or established pureblood names who have built up a reputable reputation. He could not associate with the ward of Albus Dumbledore, blood status unknown.Her words to his retreating back that night left him feeling vulnerable, as though she had seen through his front and saw him for what he was. Malfoy had made a point to avoid her, after that. He made sure he sat on opposite sides of the room when they had a class together, went out of his way to avoid seeing her but yet whenever they were in the same room he had a hard time not staring at her.The tiniest things about her mesmerized him, like how she chewed on her quill when she didn't know the answer to something, or how she twists the hair behind her ear when she's bored. He never let her catch him watching her. She was Dumbledore's ward; her blood status wasn't even known. How would his parents feel if he brought home a Dumbledore that was most likely a muggle-born? His father would not approve of him even associating with her.Malfoy dismissed the thought entirely from his head. This was nothing more than a mere curiosity about a new student. Nothing more, nothing less. It would dissolve with time.At least, that is what he hoped as he stayed hidden in the shadows, waiting for Dumbledore's ward to leave the Great Hall. Finally, footsteps approached and her merry laugh reached his ears. For a moment he froze, reveling in how carefree and happy she sounded. Until she rounded the corner and he saw who she was laughing with. Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley.Malfoy clenched his fists, stuffing his anger down as he strolled from his hiding place into view of the Gryffindors."Well, looks like Potter's picked up another homeless puppy," Malfoy sneered as he approached them.Harry turned, anger flashing in his eyes and he held Malfoy's gaze. Dahlia stiffened, fixing Malfoy with a cool gaze. "What do you want, Malfoy?""Haven't seen you since Care of Magical Creatures," Malfoy said simply, walking until he was directly in front of Dahlia."Since you were scared of going into the forest, you mean?" Harry's voice was low, a warning.Malfoy turned to give Potter his signature sneer. He looked Dahlia up and down. "At least this ones not a mudblood," Malfoy spat, the vile word hanging in the air between them.No one even had a chance to do anything before Ron launched himself at Malfoy. The two boys went down in a pile of limbs and insults. It was several moments before Harry managed to drag Ron off while Dahlia pushed Malfoy away."Stop it!" Dahlia screamed, throwing herself between the two boys. She placed a hand on Malfoy's chest and gave him a hard push backwards. Harry pinned Ron's arms behind his back, holding him at bay."Don't you dare call her that!" Ron snarled at the Slytherin boy. Blood dripped from a scratch on his face, and his right shoulder was pointed in an odd angle."Harry, he needs to go to the hospital wing." Dahlia pointed to Ron, and for the first time Harry seemed to notice what kind of shape his best friend was in. His nose was pouring like a faucet, already starting to bruise and swell. His shoulder was poking at an odd angle, one side higher than the other."Shit." Harry threw Ron's good arm over his shoulder and started to make his way to the infirmary. Ron jerked his arm away, wincing in pain but snapped, "I'm fine! I don't need help!" Before turning and stumbling towards the infirmary.Harry sighed exasperatedly, before turning back to Dahlia. "I guess I'll go back to the common room. Are you coming?""Yes," Dahlia nodded. "After I'm finished with this one," she jabbed her finger in Malfoy's direction. Harry's eyes widened, but he said nothing. He gave a jerky nod to her and then continued down the hallway.Dahlia waited until they were out of view before turning to Malfoy. He had stumbled back when she pushed him earlier, falling on the ground. He was still laying there, propped against the wall cradling his arm."Get up," Dahlia grabbed his shoulder and hauled him to his feet. He followed her hesitantly as she led him down a smaller corridor and into an abandoned classroom.Malfoy sunk into one of the desks when the door slammed behind them. He turned to find Dahlia standing toe to toe with him, glaring."What the hell was that about, Malfoy?" She demanded. Malfoy simply looked at her, enjoying the way his name had rolled off her tongue. Why did she use it? A small voice in the back of his head whispered that she really was cute, when she was mad. Her cheeks had a red blush, and her curly hair was frizzier than normal. Her hands were planted firmly on her hips as she looked up at him, demanding answers. He quickly dismissed the voice in his head, focusing on her with contempt. She wasn't a pureblood; therefore she was beneath him."I warned you about becoming friends with Potter," Malfoy spoke venomously. He was disgusted with himself for his interest in the new Gryffindor. His reputation demanded better than that; his family's reputation demanded better.Dahlia rolled her eyes. She pulled out her wand with a huff, and Malfoy recoiled. He scrambled for his own wand, falling over the desk he had been sitting on in the process.Dahlia's hand flew over her mouth to stifle her giggle, but it escaped anyways. She stood, staring at Malfoy with wide eyes until another musical laugh left her lips. The next second she was laughing so hard she had to grip the desk to remain standing."You thought I was going to hex you?" Dahlia howled, her arms wrapped around her waist.Malfoy stood up indignantly, brushing himself off with what little dignity he had left. Dahlia was laughing so hard tears rolled down her cheeks, and Malfoy scowled, muttering curses as he rubbed his elbow. "You pulled your wand." He said defensively.Dahlia's giggles subsided, and Malfoy found himself wishing she would laugh like that again. It made him feel free."I pulled my wand to fix your nose," Dahlia gestured to his face. Malfoy looked down and saw with shock that there was a steady stream of blood dripping from his nose."I'm gonna kill Weasley," the Slytherin growled as he attempted to stop the flow with his robes."Stop it," Dahlia said crossly. She pushed his arm away from his face and gestured for him to have a seat on a desk. "It's just a broken nose; I can fix it."Malfoy looked at her warily. "I'll just go to Madam Pomfrey."Dahlia rolled her eyes. "Yes, you should totally show up in the hospital wing with a broken nose five minutes after Ron appears with a dislocated shoulder. No one would guess you've been fighting then!"Malfoy regarded her suspiciously, her words holding a grain of truth. He glanced at her begrudgingly, "Fine."Dahlia turned, and with a flick of her wand went, "Episky."There was a crunch of bones, and a sharp hot pain through his face. Malfoy reached up gingerly to feel his nose, and was relieved to find the blood flow stopped, and the bone no longer crooked.Dahlia took his face in her hands as she observed her handiwork. Malfoy closed his eyes against the feeling of her hands on his cheeks. Her hands felt so soft it was almost like a caress the way her fingers gently touched his skin."Looks much better," Dahlia's voice anchored him back to reality. He opened his eyes as Dahlia backed away, heading towards the door."Why did you help me?" Malfoy called at her retreating back. No one helps someone else without wanting something in return; his father had taught him that at a young age. "Why not turn me in?"Dahlia paused for a moment, before turning back to him. "Friends don't turn friends in."Malfoy let the intensity of her words hit him before speaking. "We're not friends, Dumbledore. I'm a Malfoy."Dahlia laughed again, the delighted carefree laugh he decided he loved. "Yeah, okay, Malfoy. Isn't that what you were trying to ask me the night after my sorting?"And with that, the witch slipped through the door leaving Malfoy alone, feeling as though she might see through him too much.

Malfoy avoided her in the weeks leading up to the first event of the triwizard tournament. The way she had seen through him startled him. She had peaked through his walls so quickly, it unnerved him. However, unfortunately for him, she was everywhere.He couldn't stay far enough away from her during Care of Magical Creatures. Somehow a sniff of her honey-lavender shampoo would catch the breeze, and he would be lost in thought about what it might be like to hold her. It was infuriating.She never approached him, but they exchanged glances any time they were in the same room. Draco could feel his heart hitch every time her emerald greens locked on his stoney grey eyes. It was like an electric shock through his body. The reaction always stunned him, causing him to look away. But not before he would catch her small smile, the way she would shyly look down afterwards. His reaction disgusted himself, and he found that anger was the quickest way to shut down the strange emotions.The first event of the triwizard tournament was approaching, and Malfoy was eager to go, if only to see Potter get his ass handed to him. A small part of him nudged him to admit he was excited he would see her there, but he suppressed it.Malfoy joined his fellow Slytherins on the walk down to the event, which was held in the lowest part of the grounds. Rumor was they brought dragons, but Malfoy scoffed at the thought. Dragons? At Hogwarts? Yeah, right. Malfoy listened half assed as Blaise and Goyle argued over professional Quidditch teams. Draco was more interested in keeping an eye out for the new Gryffindor girl.Finally he spotted her emerging from the champions tent. Her clothes were mussed, and she looked flustered. He picked up his pace, concern rippling through him until the flap of the tent was pushed back and he saw Potter reach out and embrace her."Be careful, Harry!" Her voice carried over the few feet separating them. She still hadn't noticed him. The concern that had been building in him switched to silent rage.Her and Potter. Should have known. Draco snorted, changing directions to head back to Blaise when her voice stopped him, jealousy and anger boiling to the surface."Malfoy!" Her voice caught him off guard, and Draco stopped in spite of himself, grinding his teeth. She was back to calling him Malfoy."What is it, Dumbledore?" He spat at her as she came prancing up.She looked taken back by his cross demeanor. She hesitated slightly, her cheeks becoming an adorable pink. "I thought I told you I didn't like going by my surname."Malfoy shrugged, turning his back to her. "Couldn't care less," he said as he made to walk away from her."Hey!" She grabbed his elbow and swung him around.Malfoy snarled at her, jerking his arm back from her grasp. "What do you want, Dumbledore?"Dahlia's face turned from concerned too angry as she stomped her foot, amber eyes flashing. "Well, I wanted to see if you wanted to sit with me for the first event, but since you're going to be such an ass I would much rather sit by myself!"With that she spun on her heel and stormed away, leaving him feeling empty. He cursed, turning and strutting away from her retreating figure, plotting his revenge on Potter as he stormed back to his friends."Let's get a seat!" He snapped as he rejoined the Slytherins. His friends looked up, surprised at his snarky tone but complied. They filed into seats on the top row of the makeshift stadium. Malfoy observed the open middle of the arena, which was about the size of four quidditch fields. A rough terrain with rocks made it look almost mountainous, sinking into the earth in places and towering above them in others. At the very center of the circle sat a golden egg in a rocky nest."It's dragons for sure," a voice a few rows down carried to his ears. Malfoy turned, and to his disgust found Ron Weasley sitting with his twin idiot brothers, the mudblood, and the absolute imbecile, Longbottom. He opened his mouth to say a smart comment when one of the twins - he never could tell which one - confirmed his brother's statement."It's true! Been sworn to secrecy - our brother Charlie's the one that brought them over." The twin said it with pride. Malfoy paled slightly at the realization that that was a true statement; Charlie Weasley was indeed a Dragon Tamer. That meant that there was a very real possibility of truth in the boy's statements.Before Malfoy could torment the Weasley group, another sight caught his eye, a more shocking one. Sitting a few rows down to his left was Dahlia, and she was giggling with a Hufflepuff boy he recognized as Ernie McMillan.Jealousy flushed through him, and he almost stood and walked out. As soon as it was there, it left, and he was filled with disgust again. Dahlia was beneath him, and his little obsession with her would die down shortly. Instead, he forced himself to remain plastered to his seat, staring determinedly anywhere but the new couple.Malfoy barely watched as the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions captured their eggs. He hardly noticed when Cedric Diggory almost got his face burned off, as enjoyable as that would have been. All he could see was red. Every now and then he would notice how Ernie had managed to slip his arm around Dahlia's shoulders, or how anytime the dragon got too close for comfort he would tuck her into his chest.Finally, the last competitor was up. Of course it was Potter. Despite his longstanding feud with the Gryffindor, Draco found himself hoping that Harry beat this quickly so he wouldn't have to look at the disgusting scene in front of him any longer.All was going well; Harry had summoned his broom, which even Malfoy would admit he was impressed by. Everything was fine until Harry managed to snag the Golden Egg, and shot into the sky on his Firebolt. The dragon, however, was not willing to admit defeat so quickly. It opened its wings, and snapped the chains holding it to the ground. It flapped until it was hovering a few feet about the stands. With a might roar the dragon reared its head, and released a stream of fire from its mouth.Malfoy saw the whole thing as though in slow motion. He jumped from his seat, vaulting over the rows of chairs and people beneath him. He grabbed Dahlia from her seat, and before she had a chance to question him he pulled her to the ground beneath the bleachers, shouting, "Protego!"Dahlia laid sprawled across his chest, pressing his back into the ground. His shield charm went up just in time, throwing an invisible wall against the main tunnel of fire that was blasted towards them.Flames still escaped, lighting the ground and stadium around them. The dragon lost interest in the crowd beneath it, and took to the skies after Potter.Dahlia was stumbling to her feet. Her face and arms were covered in soot; her hair had gone wild in every which direction. There was a wild look in her eye that Draco recognized as panic. Before she could break down Malfoy jumped to his feet, and pulled her into his chest."Are you okay?" The words fell from his mouth as his hands ran down her back and arms, feeling for injuries. He was shaking; he couldn't stop shaking."I-I'm fine," Dahlia stammered. She lifted her eyes to meet his, and Malfoy felt a wave of relief wash over him. She was okay. As soon as that realization hit him he immediately detached her from his body, recoiling in disgust at his actions. She opened her mouth to protest, but Malfoy turned on his heel and strode away.Malfoy observed the atmosphere around him as he made his way through the destroyed stadium. Ministry officials and professors were scrambling around, escorting students to safety and extinguishing fires. Even more wizards had taken after the dragon. Even as he angrily cursed himself for his unusual display of emotion, Malfoy found himself secretly hoping Potter escaped that dragon. After this encounter, he wouldn't wish death by dragon on anyone.That night, Dahlia went out searching for Draco. Somehow he always seemed to find her, so she slipped out of her Gryffindor common room just after midnight. She was headed down the stairs towards the dungeon when familiar footsteps behind her stopped her."Going somewhere, Miss Dumbledore?" the headmaster voice rang out, sounding slightly amused.Dahlia huffed, turning to face her guardian. She didn't dare tell him she was looking for a Slytherin boy, so she said the first thing that came to her head. "Just going for a walk; I couldn't sleep.""Perhaps instead of a walk we could get some tea? Or I could join you on your stroll."Dahlia managed to hide her frustration. She really needed to speak to Malfoy; she was tired of the games he had been playing the last few weeks. She'd thought he had been trying to ask her to be friends in his own twisted way, so she had thought that by showing him some kindness he might see she wasn't against that. However, he seemed to think nothing of her - even told her that - yet saves her from the dragon? She needed answers, and she also needed to tell him thank you. Instead, however, she plastered a smile on her face, and offered her hand to her guardian. "It's been a while since we've taken a walk together."Dumbledore accepted her offer with a smile, and together they exited the castle and strolled down to the gardens. They walked amicably in peace for several minutes before the headmaster broke the spell."I believe there was something you wanted to ask me, after your sorting?"Dahlia glanced up at Dumbledore in shock; she was surprised he remembered. The headmaster chuckled at her look of shock, waggling a finger at her. "I know everything that goes on in Hogwarts, my dear, and I forget nothing.""Alright then," Dahlia began hesitantly, still slightly off put. Curiosity got the best of her, so she asked, "Did you hear what the Sorting Hat was saying?"Dumbledore offered her an amused grin. "I am one of the very few that the sorting hat chooses to include in conversations, when it deems necessary."Dahlia processed this information, her brow crinkling. "You mean it's not normal for you to hear every sorting conversation? You don't hear every student's?"Albus laughed heartily. "Goodness, no. The conversation between hat and student is private, except in particularly tricky cases. In which, the sorting hat allows me to... listen in. I cannot join the conversation or influence it in any way, but I'm a silent third party nonetheless.""So I was a particularly tricky case?" Dahlia disliked that wording. Why was she different? Why couldn't the sorting hat just pick a house for her itself? "How many other students have you been allowed to hear?"Dumbledore hesitated, very slightly, but Dahlia noticed it anyways. She paused, forcing Dumbledore to come to a complete stop next to her. She cocked her head at him, demanding an answer silently. Dumbledore looked down into her eyes as he solemnly said, "Only three, in the past century."Dahlia's jaw dropped, brows furrowing. That wasn't just uncommon... that was extremely rare."What made me so special? What is so different about me that the hat cannot choose a house for me?" Dahlia demanded, turning to her guardian. Confusion fueled her panic - why was she different? "The hat spoke of my mother and father's blood. Does that mean it knows who my parents are?"Dumbledore shook his head. "The magic of the sorting hat is a mystery, even to me. I do not know for certain, but I believe the sorting hat cannot see your direct genetic makeup. I believe the hat sorts based on your magic, and your family's magic. I think it recognized the traces of your parents' magic in you, and was therefore able to determine what houses from which they came."Dahlia processed this information, realization dawning on her face. "That means my parents went to Hogwarts?"Dumbledore hesitated, but answered steadily. "Yes, at some point or another both of your parents would have passed through the school."Dahlia's eyes lit up, suddenly eager. This meant there would be records of her parents - she just had to find out where to start. "Does this mean we can find out who my parents are?"Dumbledore patted his wards head kindly, his head shaking sadly. "Dahlia, I've been searching for your parents since the day you arrived, searching for any kind of answer as to why you were here in this time, and what your heritage is."Dahlia's excitement was extinguished. If Albus had been searching for years, he would have already looked through all Hogwarts records and found nothing. Her face settled into a scowl, hopes dampened."Please, trust me when I say, when the time for you to know who your parents are comes, you will know. Do not try to force this matter."Dahlia rolled her eyes at the words her guardian spoke. While Dumbledore had never hidden from her that she was an orphan, he always shut down conversations about her parents - going so far as to change the conversation entirely. Or, if not, it would always end in a warning to leave it alone. Her growing curiosity was demanding answers, even as the rest of her knew it was a lost cause.Dumbledore patted Dahlia's hand comfortingly, jarring her attention back to him. She glared up at him, hand twitching away from him in frustration. "I know it is frustrating, my dear, but I didn't come to talk to you tonight to quibble."Dahlia sighed, rolling her eyes as she resigned herself to the fact that she would have to choose this fight another time. "What is it then, Albus?"Dumbledore glanced around quickly, before tightly gripping her arm. His actions scared her; the pressure on her arm wasn't painful, but it was tight. She looked at him in alarm, finding no relief when his eyes held a bit of fear in them. His fear startled her; she had seen him worried many times over the years, but never fearful. His words gripped her next, chilling her to the bone. "There are strange things happening this year at Hogwarts, things I'm having issues discovering. Please, be on your guard. Be extra vigilant in everything."Dahlia was frozen to the spot, her guardians warning playing over and over in her head. "Is it Voldemort?" Her words came out as a whisper, wide eyes looking up at her guardian. Albus's face settled into a grim line, his piercing blue eyes scanning her face closely.Fear of a name increases fear of the things itself. Dumbledore had said that to her many times over the years as they discussed the rising of the Dark Lord. He had never shied away from using his name, not even when she was a child. Dahlia found that he was correct; she held no fear for the name; and therefore she held less fear of the man. Everything that was born must die, Dumbledore had told her. That meant Voldemort was a man, nothing more, nothing less.Dumbledore's grip loosened, but he remained hold of her arm, his gaze still sharp on her face. Worry lines formed on his forehead, the deep ones that only revealed themselves when drastic times were approaching. "The Dark Lord is behind just about everything, these days. Take care to not reveal yourself."Dahlia nodded stiffly, his words doing nothing to ease her own fear. "Of course, Albus."Dumbledore smiled affectionately at his ward, though the worry lines were still apparent. "You should head back to bed. You have classes in the morning." And with that, he kissed her lightly on the cheek as he bade her goodnight, leaving her standing in the gardens with the moon as her only light.Dahlia was headed back to her common room a few minutes later when she remembered her original purpose for leaving the common room in the first place. She quickly changed courses, heading directly for the dungeons. She wasn't exactly sure of where in the dungeons the Slytherin common room was, but it couldn't be hard to find. The air around her got colder, the walls damper as she descended deeper into the castle.Dahlia didn't even make it down the first corridor before she spotted him. Malfoy was perched in a window in an empty classroom. He leaned against the wall, his head relaxed backwards. He had his eyes closed, the moonlight bouncing off his pale hair from a sky light. Dahlia froze in the doorway. Sitting there like that he looked so peaceful. So relaxed. Dahlia couldn't bring herself to interrupt his moment of peace, and she made to leave the room."Don't go," Malfoy's whisper stopped her. She paused, turning back to face him. His eyes were now open, and staring straight at her. His gaze was soft for once as he took her in, shivering and red cheeked. "What's a Gryffindor doing wandering around the dungeons at night?" His voice was commanding again, all signs of weakness gone as his face hardened to its usual disdainful coldness.Dahlia suddenly found herself nervous, the butterflies in her stomach making her almost nauseated. "I-I came to thank you," she stammered, eyeing him skeptically.Draco watched her intently, his face stoic. His eyes traveled from her face, down to her chest, and then jerked back up to her face again as if he realized what he was doing. Dahlia blushed under his scrutiny, but held his gaze as his eyes settled back on hers."No need," Malfoy said gruffly, shifting uncomfortably. His eyes darted away, back up to the moon directly above them. Dahlia managed a weak smile; she figured it would make him uncomfortable, but she wasn't done."You saved my life," Dahlia whispered the words, looking up at him. It was the first time she'd admitted it, even to herself. Her words caught him off guard; Draco met her eyes, and was weakened by the trust that filled them. Silence filled the room as Draco held her gaze, unable to bring himself to look away. He let the amber eyes draw him in for a second before he caught himself, breaking her gaze and looking back up to the stars."Too bad the dragon didn't get that Hufflepuff you were flirting with ," Malfoy covered his moment of weakness with sarcasm. Inwardly he scolded himself, reminded himself of who he was, and who she was.Dahlia's cheeks flushed immediately, anger sparking. "I was not flirting!""He had his arm around you and everything!" Malfoy protested, crossing his arms as he glared at her indignantly. She planted her hands on her hips, scowling at him."So?""So?!" Malfoy glowered back at her, spitting the word back at her spitefully.Dahlia's face turned into a pout, face falling as though disappointed. "I thought we were friends.""We are." Malfoy didn't know what the hell possessed him to say that, when the last thing that he was supposed to be doing was be friends with someone like her. He bit his tongue and looked away from her, regretting the words.Dahlia fixed him with a piercing look as she turned to walk away. "Then why do you care who I flirt with?"By the time he had recovered from his shock she had fled the dungeon.

The next time Dahlia saw Malfoy it ruined her entire week. Ever since she had sought him out in the dungeons, he had avoided her. Again. She was getting extremely sick of him being nice, almost seeming like he had feelings for her, and then treating her like she was dirt on the bottom of his shoe. It was infuriating, and she was doneAfter a week of stone cold silence, Dahlia had had enough. Malfoy hadn't even met her eye one time in the past week, and frankly she was done trying. She had thought maybe there was something different about him, maybe he wasn't as bad as everyone is always saying. Turns out she was wrong, and they were right. He was a prat, and a prideful one at that. Instead, Dahlia threw herself into her classes. Hermione and her turned out to be fast friends, and quickly she was introduced to Ron's sister, a third-year who openly had a thing for Harry.Dahlia thought it was cute, honestly. She imagined if Harry ever got his head out of his ass and focused on something other that quidditch he'd notice the girl. She was pretty, in her own way. Dahlia had no doubt she'd be beautiful in a few years.Dahlia was storming across the school one morning when someone called out to her, "Hey, Dahlia, wait up!"She turned, frowning at the unfamiliar voice. Trotting up behind her was Cedric Diggory, the Hogwarts champion. Dahlia slowed her pace immediately, subconsciously trying to fix her hair which she knew was all over the place."Hey, Cedric," She greeted him with a shy smile, slightly puzzled on why he would approaching her."How've classes been?" Diggory walked side by side with her across the courtyard. A couple giggling school girls took notice of them, and frowned in Dahlia's direction but she ignored them. His attempt at casual conversation was weak, piquing Dahlia's interest more."They're alright," Dahlia conceded, meeting Cedric's eyes questioningly. He seemed to sense her suspicion, asking quickly, "Any chance you've seen Potter? I've been looking for him."Before Dahlia could reply Harry's voice could be heard yelling. The couple turned, drawn to the commotion. They reached the middle of the courtyard and found Harry and Draco shouting at each other, wands drawn. Cedric slid an arm around her shoulders, attempting to step in front of her as though to protect her.Dahlia allowed it for a moment as she watched. Harry turned to walk away, but Malfoy's face twisted in fury and he shouted a hex at Harry's back."Harry!" Dahlia shrugged Cedric's arm from around her shoulders and jumped in front of Harry just as the hex hit. With a yelp, Dahlia flew backwards, knocking her and Harry to the ground. Instantly Dahlia's skin became inflamed, red sores erupting on her arms and chest. She groaned, rolling off of Harry and onto the ground beside him."Dahlia!" Harry and Malfoy's voices mixed into one. She curled up on the ground, moaning as Harry knelt on his knees beside her. She vaguely heard Malfoy's voice over the roar in her ears. Her body felt like it was on fire, her skin irritated and itchy."Dahlia, are you okay?" Harry's voice barely registered as Dahlia groaned, blinking her eyes open slowly."Malfoy!" Professor Moody was striding across the courtyard, his wand raised. His disturbing mechanical eye was whirling back and forth, taking in the scene before him. Before any of the students could react the professor shot a bright light at Malfoy, and a second later a pure white ferret laid on the ground where Malfoy had been previously sitting. "This'll teach you to hex another student while their back is turned!""Malfoy!" Dahlia moaned, reaching her hand out. The pain from the hex was subsiding, and an irrational itch was building all throughout her body. It felt like her whole body had gone pins and needles, combined with chickenpox and poison ivy."PROFESSOR MOODY!" Professor McGonagall's voice rang clear throughout the courtyard. "We do not use transfiguration on students as a punishment!"One flick of her wand later and a disheveled, panic Malfoy was sprawled on the ground where the ferret had been moments ago. Malfoy scrambled to his feet, patting his body as if not believing it was all there."You!" He bellowed at Professor Moody, turning a crazed look on the ex-auror. "My father will hear about this!""Professor!" Harry's frantic voice rang out. Dahlia was still on the ground, the welts on her body multiplying by the second. Professor McGonagall turned, her face morphing from anger to shock when she noticed her student on the ground. Malfoy's face paled when he turned to see Dahlia writhing on the ground, now groaning in pain. He stood, staring as Professor McGonagall rushed to Dahlia's side.His hands clenched into fists as he looked at her moaning in pain on the ground. She was going to hate him; she was never going to speak to him again. Deep down inside, a part of him was glad. She should hate him, just he should hate her. The guilt at the sight of her on the ground in pain ate at him, her soft cries of pain sending him into a panic."Potter, what happened?" Professor McGonagall knelt down next to Dahlia. The transfiguration teacher quickly observed the boils that were spreading across Dahlia's body."I don't know, professor! She got hit with a hex -""Clearly, Mr. Potter, thank you so much for the clarity!"The Gryffindor seemed too shocked by her sarcasm to come up with a response. Instead he turned his attention back to his friend on the ground. Dahlia's hands were clenched at her sides, face scrunched in pain as she writhed against the building incessant need to itch. It was stinging, like needles were being jabbed into her skin. "Can you help her, professor?"McGonagall finished a quick examination, trying not to worsen the hex. The Professor shook her head grimly, "No, she will need to see Madam Pomphrey, immediately.""I'll take her," Harry knelt down as if to lift Dahlia into his arms.The green eyed monster inside Draco baulked at the thought of Potter carrying Dahlia in his arms. Malfoy spoke, surprising even himself at his words. "I'll take her."Harry bristled instantly. "No, you will not! You're the reason -""Diggory needed to talk to you anyways, didn't he?" Malfoy cut Potter off, turning to the Hufflepuff that was now crouching beside Dahlia, concern on his face. The Slytherin stepped forward until he was standing on the other side of her, looking down at the Hufflepuff.Diggory looked up, clearly not paying attention. "Oh, um, yeah, I did. But it can wait until later," he added hastily at Harry's incredulous look.Malfoy opened his mouth to protest again, when Dahlia's hoarse voice spoke."Malfoy?" Her voice was weak, followed a moment later by a moan of pain. She lifted a hand as though reaching for him; and that was his undoing.His legs propelled him forward until he was on the ground beside her, gathering her into his chest. "I guess that settles that," he said with a smirk as he gently lifted Dahlia into his arms, pinning Potter with a haughty glance as he strode away._The next time Dahlia opened her eyes she was lying in a bed in the hospital wing. She groaned as she pushed herself into sitting. She looked down, surprised to see she was in a hospital gown, and her arms were wrapped in gauze."You should keep resting," a familiar voice spoke from the foot of her bed.Dahlia lifted her gaze to meet the stoney grey eyes watching her. He stood at the end of her bed, braced against the bed frame. "Malfoy..?" the words left her lips as a whisper. He looked horrible. His clothes were wrinkled as though he hadn't slept in days. His normally well kept hair was sticking out in odd directions, and the bags under his eyes spoke testaments. He was watching her closely, as though worried she'd hurt herself by moving."Why did you jump in front?" His angry question wasn't what she was expecting. His face morphed into a scowl quickly, his eyes squinting at her accusingly. She recoiled slightly, jumping in surprise at his tone."Why did I..." Dahlia looked at him, her eyes turning from confused to cold. "Why did you try to curse him, Malfoy?"The Slytherin boy visibly winced at the accusation in her tone. His voice as bitter as he relied, "He said shit about my dad."Dahlia threw her hands up exasperatedly, looking at the Slytherin as though dumbfounded. "And how many times have you made comments about his parents? About how they're dead?"Draco lifted his head mournfully. "I didn't mean for the hex to hit you!" His words were filled with conviction and guilt. He searched her face, his eyes wide in panic. "Why did you take that hex? For Potter, of all people!"Angrily, Dahlia pushed herself upright, ignoring the split second of concern that flashed across his face and the flash of pain across her skin. "In case you haven't noticed, Harry is my friend. I wasn't going to sit by and watch you hex him while his back was turned!""It wasn't your fight! If you had kept your nose in your own business you wouldn't have been hit with the Irritation Hex!" Her words only spiked his anger more. He walked around until he was standing beside her bed, glowering down at her.Dahlia leaned forward and struck him across the face. The resounding Slap! Echoed through the empty hospital wing. Malfoy recoiled, flinching backwards instinctively as his hand rose to cover the rising red hand print across his face."Don't you dare turn this into my fault. You tried to hex another student whose back was turned. I would have jumped in front of that hex regardless of who you aimed it at." Dahlia's eyes were filling up with angry tears as she stared at the shocked Slytherin before her. Her amber eyes flashed with anger, glaring at him indignantly."Such a Gryffindor," Malfoy sneered, stiffening as he turned to walk away. "So noble. So brave. So loyal.""You say that like it's a bad thing," Dahlia retorted calmly at his turned back."It is," Malfoy snarled over his shoulder, storming out of the hospital wing, the door slamming closed behind him.Only after he left did Dahlia resort to tears, and she only allowed herself a few moments. Not long after she pulled herself together Madam Pomfrey came hesitantly around the corner."You've got visitors, dear," the cheerful nurse said as she approached, a bright smile on her face."If it's Draco Malfoy tell him to leave me alone or I'll hex his favorite part off," Dahlia snarled, turning away from the nurse, sinking further into the bed.Madam Pomfrey regarded her curiously for a moment before speaking again. "Actually, it's Mr. Potter and his friends to see you. Should I let them in... or give them your warning about 'their favorite parts'?" The nurse was clearly trying to contain her amusement."Oh," Dahlia rolled back over, brushing any remnant signs of tears from her blushing cheeks. "Yes, please, let them in."A few moments later Harry, Ron, and Hermione came around the corner. Hermione immediately ran to embrace Dahlia, expressing how happy she was that everything was okay.Harry pulled up a seat, Ron following suit. Hermione situated herself at the foot of Dahlia's bed as Harry spoke, "Thank you, by the way," his green eyes flickered up to hers, radiating guilt. "I know that hex was meant for me."Dahlia shrugged, uncomfortable with the apology. She waved her hand as though to say it was nothing. "It wasn't fair; he hexed you while your back was turned.""Still," Harry insisted. "You didn't have to do what you did.""Yeah, a Protego probably would have done the job just as well." Ron spoke for the first time. His bad attempt at humor actually drew a smile out of the group."Well, what's done is done." Dahlia said dismissively after the group shared a smile at the irony. "What all have I missed?""Two whole days. And Malfoy being turned into a ferret.""Malfoy was what?!" Dahlia stared at Ron in shock, not sure her ears had heard correctly. "Did you guys turn Malfoy into a ferret?!"Harry, Ron, and Hermione all burst out laughing. "Merlin, no, but I wish we had!" Hermione exclaimed as she wiped a tear from her eye."Mad Eye Moody turned him into a ferret for trying to curse Harry. It all happened like seconds after you were hexed." Ron explained, offering her a chocolate frog.The group chatted amicably for a while before Madam Pomfrey agreed that Dahlia could be released from the hospital wing, so long as she promised to use an ointment that Madam Pomfrey had concocted for her over the next week.

Snape definitely had it out for her. Dahlia had noticed over the past few weeks how Professor Snape had become even more critical of her potions work. He deducted house points for obscure reasons, and gave her detention for the first time in her life. He also decided that he didn't like a group of Gryffindors working together, so he had split her, Hermione, Ron, and Harry up.Somehow, she had ended up with Malfoy as a partner. When she moved seats, and turned to find him already looking at her with a smirk on his face she had a hard time containing her wrath. It was almost like he was pleased she had to be his partner - as though he knew the torture it caused her, and he enjoyed it."Take a picture, Malfoy, it lasts longer," she snarled at the Slytherin next to her when he continued to look at her. She could feel his eyes on her, even when she paid him no attention. Her words caught him off guard, his gaze jerking down, his cheeks turning an attractive rose color."Can't help that you look stunning today," he whispered, lifting his eyes to meet hers. His words shocked her, but it was the look he gave her that took her breath away. There were no walls, no fronts, just raw emotion. He didn't hide his attraction, his want in that moment, and Dahlia got lost in his eyes. Her cheeks flamed red and she jerked her eyes back to her work.Had Draco Malfoy just complimented her?"Detention, this evening for you, Miss Dumbledore. And Mr. Malfoy as well." Snape's clipped tone said, his lips curled in a cruel smile, his hand smacking down on the top of their desk, startling them both.Neither student protested, turning their attention back to the potion they were supposed to be recreating with out a sound. Not a word was shared between the two for the entire lesson, but when Dahlia was cleaning up and preparing to leave for the day she noticed a note, scribbled on a scrap piece of paper, tucked into her potion's book.

Meet me in the Owlery tower after detention.

Dahlia's voice caught as she reread the note, scared she misread it the first time. She glanced around, hoping to see him still lingering in the potions classroom, but he had already vanished. Her heart accelerated at the note, though suspicion rose despite it.Sighing, Dahlia proceeded throughout her day, forcing thoughts of the note from her mind. Classes dragged by, detention looming horribly in her future. It didn't go as horribly as she imagined it would; Snape had her cleaning out old Cauldrons for the hour and Malfoy was sent to the storage room to reorganize the potions supplies. Thankfully, she'd been permitted to use her wand, and therefore had a relatively easy hour.At the end of their detention hour Professor Snape let her go, regarding Dahlia in a particularly cold way as he leered at her from across his desk. "You will do well to remember to pay attention in my class in the future.""Yes, professor," Dahlia spoke, hesitantly meeting the Potion Master's eyes. The second her eyes collided with his he physically winced, and spun around, turning his back to her."Leave now." It wasn't an option; it was a command.Dahlia scurried out of the room, bumping into Malfoy who was emerging from the storage closet down the corridor."Um, hey," Dahlia greeted him, raising a small hand in greeting as she walked towards him."Hey," He watched her as she approached him, his gaze never once leaving her face until she stood a few feet from him."Why are we going to the Owlry?" Dahlia asked as he motioned for them to start down the corridor. She felt in step beside him easily, though she maintained her curious stare."You'll see," Malfoy shrugged, giving her a glance from the corner of his eye."I don't like surprises," Dahlia warned as she followed him down the hallway, slightly on guard.Malfoy smirked at her. "Good; this isn't a surprise."Dahlia regarded the boy beside her curiously. "Malfoy, if this is some cruel joke or plot of some sort leave me out of it!"Malfoy froze, turning to face her. His face was a mask of disgust and anger, face scrunched in a scowl as he said harshly, "If I wanted to pull something on you, Dumbledore, I would do it while there was an audience, not 9:00 on a Thursday when our fellow classmates have all but gone to bed."Dahlia's brows furoughed as she processed his statement, face relaxing slightly at the truth in his words. "Okay. I'm sorry," she admitted, looking up at him. He huffed back at her, but resumed walking. They trotted in silence for a minute before Dahlia grabbed Draco's hand.The unexpected human contact shocked Malfoy, and he recoiled out of instinct, jerking his hand from her grip. Dahlia looked surprised at his reaction, hesitantly withdrawing her hand as she gestured to a gargoyle behind them. "I know a shortcut... I said your name but you were off in your head somewhere and didn't hear me.""Oh," Draco mentally shook himself and he watched Dahlia. She stood before the gargoyle and whispered something in its ear. At her words the Gargoyle sprang to life, jumping to the right to reveal a small passageway.Dahlia dove right in, turning to offer him her hand. "Coming?"Knowing he would follow her whether he wanted to or not, he obliged her. He took her hand after a moment's hesitation, and allowed her to lead him down the narrow passageway. She trotted ahead of him for several minutes, tugging him along quickly before the passageway ended in a brick wall. The bricks were cracked and old, clearly an ancient part of the castle."Brilliant," Malfoy said sarcastically, leaning against the rough wall of the passage, dropping her hand the instant they stopped moving. "It's a dead end."Dahlia rolled her eyes, and reached out her hand. She pressed a brick on the door, and the door rolled away revealing the stairway to the owlery."Have some faith," Dahlia said as she crossed from the passage to the big open room. The owlery had been expanded to offer a small, libraryish room on the inside where there was parchment and quills available for students to write letters conveniently. Draco shot an annoyed glance at her back that she missed as she strode ahead of him.Dahlia crossed the Letter room, as the students called it, and dropped into one of the chairs. Draco did the same, choosing a seat directly to her right."So, why are we here?" Dahlia looked to the Slytherin boy expectantly, not bothering with small talk."I..." Draco just shrugged, glancing at the wall across the room. "Thought it would be fun."Dahlia quirked an eyebrow at him, her brows shooting up in surprise.. "You thought it would be fun to hang out in the owlery?"Draco growled at her, shooting a scathing glance at her. "No.""So.... then what?" Dahlia gave him one of his own smirks, which he discovered he found extremely attractive, if not slightly infuriating."I just thought it'd be nice to spend some time with you, you know, alone!" Malfoy barked at her, pushing up from the chair to pace back and forth across the room. He crossed his arms defensively, pausing to glare at her. "If that's not what you want then that's fine, leave!"Dahlia gasped at the outburst, a small smile playing across her lips. She quickly got to her feet and crossed the room so she was standing directly in front of Draco, never once breaking eye contact with him. The Slytherin was still glaring at her with defiance, but she could see the flicker of vulnerability in his eyes. She smiled; he didn't want her to leave."I'd like that, actually," Dahlia said softly, offering him a smile, crossing her own arms as she cocked her head at him. She stood only a few inches from him, looking up directly into his eyes.Draco seemed surprised by the turn of events, but gave a jerky nod, attention completely locked onto her. She smiled, the sweetness in her was so intoxicating he didn't even realize had followed her until they were both sitting back in their chairs."Tell me about yourself," Dahlia said, looking at Draco expectantly, leaning over the arm of her chair towards him. "I really don't know anything about you.""There's really not much to know," Draco said as he reclined back in the chair, turning his head to watch her."That can't be true," Dahlia said, rolling her eyes as shook her head in mock disappointment. "I've seen you on the quidditch field; tell me how you got into flying."Dahlia couldn't have asked a better question. Draco smiled a rare smile, lighting up his face, making him look like an angel in the moonlight reflecting onto his skin. He leaned forward, his voice softly excited, speaking with loving conviction. "It was my mum, actually. My dad used to leave for long periods at a time, and at night she would fly when she couldn't sleep." Dahlia noticed the way his face relaxed when he talked about his mum and flying. "One night I saw her from my window, so I went outside too. She saw me and took me up with her. After that, any time she went out for a fly she would wake me up and take me with her."Dahlia loved the way his voice softened, and how he smiled as he spoke about it, almost like it was the happiest time of his life."Your mum sounds amazing," Dahlia admitted quietly, dropping her gaze from the Slytherin's, feeling as though she was intruding on a private moment with his memory."Yeah, she kind of is," Draco offered a smile, one Dahlia eagerly returned. Dahlia scooted her chair closer to his, leaning towards him. Draco inhaled, encouraged to continue the conversation. "So, you were raised by Dumbledore?" Draco made an attempt at conversation to distract himself from the way her shampoo scent was lingering in the air.Dahlia nodded, leaning back into her chair, tensing slightly at the topic, but answering him nonetheless. "Yeah, I don't really know much about my parents."Malfoy cocked an eyebrow at her, sitting up slightly. "Doesn't that drive you mad?"To his surprise, a soft laugh echoed from her throat. "You know, no one has ever asked me that. It does, actually." She glanced at him, still laughing as she slid back into her chair. He found her laugh delightful, found himself wanting to be the cause of it more often."What's so funny?"Dahlia shrugged, giving him a sweet smile that melted him on the inside. "I just like your honesty."Draco snorted, disbelief flashing across his features. "You'd be the first." He let a moment of silence fall between them before speaking again. "What do you know about them?"Dahlia rolled her eyes, knowing he referenced her parents. "If this is about my blood status, you'll be happy to hear I'm no muggle-born."Draco's eyes shot open wide, leaning forward, suddenly invested in the conversation. "You've found out more about your parents recently?""Not much," Dahlia admitted, confused by his genuine curiosity, but conceding anyways. "The Sorting Hat said some things."Draco laughed, "I remember that wacky old hat. He talked to you?""Yeah, he and I had a whole conversation. He didn't talk to you?"Draco frowned, thinking back to his experience with the sorting hat. "No, they sat the hat on my head for half a second and it declared me a Slytherin. I didn't know it spoke beyond that and the song."Dahlia looked at him curiously. He seemed so... upset by that. Hesitantly she reached out, placing her hand on his hand. He didn't recoil like he had earlier, but he tensed. He allowed her hand to rest on his, though his made no movement to cover hers."Is that why it was on your head so long?" Dahlia was shocked by Slytherin's question; he refused to look at her still, head lowered, eyes locked on her hand covering his larger one."I-I guess. It felt like only a few seconds to me."His eyes stayed trained on their hands as she spoke again, hoping to fill the great silence in the room. "I'm one of three students in the past century that the sorting hat has allowed Albus Dumbledore to listen to its conversation."Dahlia had been hoping that bizarre statement would jerk him out of whatever self pity reverie he had been in. It worked; His eyes jerked up to hers, surprise evident. "What do you mean?"Dahlia hesitated, glancing down and back up at him. He studied her face silently, as though trying to read her thoughts."If I tell you this," Dahlia whispered hesitantly, "You take it to your grave."The seriousness of her words must have impacted him. He shifted forward so his hands were on his knees as he looked her in the eye."Nothing that is said here tonight will be spoken of again." His words were serious, a promise that he wouldn't speak of it.Ignoring the tiny voice of doubt that sounded suspiciously like Harry's voice, Dahlia confided in him. "When the sorting hat went on my head, it was dark and quiet. And then it spoke in my ear, talking about how I was predestined for two houses.""Predestined for two houses?" Draco's brow furrowed, confusion contorting his features. "That doesn't make sense.""I know," Dahlia agreed, shaking her head in defeat. "The hat told me how I was light and dark, the mark of two founders, whatever that means." Draco continued to stare at her, whether he was interested or not she couldn't tell so she rushed on. "It spoke of my mother and father's blood, almost as if it knew who they were, who I was."She paused again, before speaking so softly Draco almost missed it. "It told me to choose; so I chose my house."Malfoy gaped at her. He stood up, rubbing a hand over his face as he processed what she had just told him. He paced for several seconds, rubbing his jaw before he stopped in front of her, grey eyes boring into her amber ones."You're saying it didn't decide for you?""The hat told me it could not place me, so I had to choose." Dahlia whispered the words for the first time, gaze flickering away immediately after her confession.Malfoy turned back to her, chest heaving. "And you chose Gryffindor?"Dahlia nodded, "Yeah."Malfoy turned slightly to stare at her in wonderment for a second before a sneer was plastered on his face once again. "Lucky you, Dumbledore's ward, the hat likely was too scared of the headmaster to attempt to sort you. Imagine the dishonor if it placed you in Slytherin."Dahlia gasped at his outbreak; she hadn't anticipated his anger. Again. Her lower lip quivered as she stood, anger flashing in her own eyes as her tone raised. "If you must know, Malfoy, the hat didn't offer me a choice of all houses. It offered me Gryffindor or Slytherin."Draco's head snapped up so quick she was surprised his neck didn't break. He stared at her, clinging to her every word. She'd been offered Slytherin? His eyes scanned her face for any sign she was lying, but Dahlia met his gaze with a dead, determined one of her own."The only reason I chose Gryffindor was because I wanted friends. The hat said "friends, loyal to the end" waited for me there. I wanted to not be alone. The thought of being a Slytherin wasn't a dishonor to me, nor did it repulse me." Dahlia shot at the pale boy standing in front of her, arms crossing in defiance.Draco's eyes were full of sorrow as he looked at her. She gasped at the beauty in them, as they swam with tears. "You chose well then," Draco said softly, turning his back to her, speaking over his shoulder as he walked away. "You are never anything but lonely in Slytherin."With that he was gone, disappearing down the stairs to the owlery so fast she didn't have time to call after him.

Dahlia searched desperately for Malfoy over the next several days. She even arrived at classes early in an attempt to catch him, but he always arrived just as class was starting and escaped the moment class was over. He had even skipped Potions, where she had been guaranteed to see him as they were still partners.Dahlia could assume why he was avoiding her like the plague. It seemed that any time Malfoy showed any sign of being human and having emotions he would distance himself. Even though she understood it, doesn't mean she liked it. She hated how desperate she felt as she combed the hallways of people, hoping to catch a glimpse of him.After a week she had given up. He didn't want to see her, so he wouldn't. She forced herself to stop looking for him in the hallways, burying her nose in a book or walking with friends from class to class. The emptiness inside her seemed to grow each day he distanced himself, but Dahlia tried to push it aside and continue as if nothing happened. As far as her friends knew, nothing had. Draco Malfoy was a temporary lapse in judgement she would be keeping to herself.The only good thing in the past week is Cedric Diggory and her have become better friends. She had bumped into him at the library three days ago, and since then he had asked her to study with him every day since. He was nice, but not her type. He was almost more interest in talking to her then getting any actual school work done; something she found very annoying considering she had an extreme load of classwork due this week. Despite that, she found herself saying yes each time he asked, much to her regret later.Dahlia was waiting in the library when the handsome Hufflepuff approached her. "Hey, pretty lady," he greeted her with a wink."Hey, Cedric," Dahlia rolled her eyes at him, pretending to be disgusted by his flirting. It was rather easy, considering she was fairly certain he greeted every girl like that."How's your day been?""Better now," Dahlia teased as she made room for him at her table. A fake flirtation couldn't be harmful - perhaps it would even boost her mood. "How's the tournament going?"Cedric shrugged as he lowered his bag to the ground. "One event left, and we won't even know what it is until nearly the end of the Spring Semester. I'm more concerned about the Yule Ball at this point.""Yule Ball?" Dahlia stared at him blankly, looking skeptical. "There's a ball?"Cedric laughed as he pulled a chair up to her table, nodding. "Yeah, apparently. The four champions are required to dance, or whatever.""Damn, you better have some moves!" Dahlia poked him jokingly with her finger."Yeah about that... you're going to have to teach me how to dance," Cedric spoke quickly, his hands ready for any attack she was about to throw at him.Instead of attacking like he thought she would Dahlia merely threw her head back and laughed. "Me? Teach you to dance? You're out of luck. I can't dance."Cedric's face fell. He dramatically buried his face in his hands, sighing loudly. "I'm ruined. Someone Avada me right now."Dahlia laughed at him until her eye caught a very pissed off Slytherin. Malfoy was in a book aisle a few rows away from where their table was seated, and by the murderous look on his face he had heard everything. His eyes caught hers and she could physically see the anger he was fighting against. He ground his teeth a couple times before huffing and storming her direction.Dahlia watched, eyes wide as the Slytherin approached her table. What was he going to do? He was the one ignoring her, so whatever he had to be mad about was invalid. She watched his, resigned and suspicious as he approached, grey eyes flashing dangerously.Malfoy stormed right up to the table, running a hand through his perfectly gelled hair as he stopped a few feet away. He glared at Diggory, his voice strained as though he was trying to remain calm. "I need to talk to Dumbledore."Dahlia ground her teeth, glaring at the Slytherin who had yet to speak to her. "I've told you, Malfoy, I don't go by my surname."Draco's eyes flashed at her defiance, flickering over to her for the briefest of moments. His face remained impassive, his voice tight. "Fine, Dahlia, I need to talk to you."Cedric looked back and forth between Dahlia and Malfoy, eye brows raised in curiosity before pushing his chair back. "I'm interrupting something. I can go." When Dahlia opened her mouth to protest Cedric offered her an understanding smile. "I'll see you this evening, okay?""Okay," Dahlia let the Hufflepuff retreat before turning her eyes on the seething Slytherin boy. She crossed her arms defiantly, rolling her eyes as she faced Malfoy. His face a deep pink, his hands clenched into fists, chest shuddering as he attempted to calm himself."What does he mean he'll see you this evening?" Malfoy's voice was dangerously low."What does it matter to you?" Dahlia hissed back at him, planting her hands on her hips, challenging him.Malfoy ground his teeth a couple times, but didn't form any words. Finally he looked at the witch in front of him, his eyes a little wild as he spoke. "Are you with him?"Dahlia's eyes opened wide as he realized what he was asking, before she snorted and shook her head, "No, I'm not."Some of the tension visibly drained from Malfoy's shoulders as he looked at her intently, trying to decipher for himself what had just happened. His hand reached out to rest on hers. She allowed the movement, squeezing his hand back as his fingers slid into place over hers. A moment later he stepped back, jerking her hand and causing her to stumble after him. He pulled her towards the back of the library where only older students went to study. She matched his pace, quietly darting through the aisles until they bumped into a reading corner, nestled deep into the Library. Only four chairs surrounded them, all of which were empty. Draco came to a stop, tugging Dahlia to a stop behind him."If you aren't together, why did he call you that?" Draco's voice was harsh, demanding, his grip on her wrist suddenly a little painful. There was a quiver in his voice, so slight it was barely detectable, but it matched the flash of vulnerability in his eyes."Call me what?" Dahlia looked at him in confusion. What was he talking about?"'Pretty lady'," Malfoy snarled, taking a step closer to her until they were toe to toe, him glaring down at her.. "He greeted you and said 'Hey, pretty lady.'"Dahlia's jaw dropped as she stared at the Slytherin in front of her. She cocked her head, regarding the Slytherin with curiosity. "Are you jealous, Malfoy?""Just answer my question," Draco demanded, leaning forward until they were nose to nose. Dahlia's breath hitched as they met, her soft gasp not escaping his ears. Their eyes met, Desperate meeting Defiant, and there was a momentary stand off before Dahlia lowered her gaze, submitting."I don't know why he called me that," she admitted softly. "We met a few weeks ago -" a strangled sound left Draco's throat and he started to interrupt her but she held her hand up, signalling him to wait. "We met the day you hexed me, and then never spoke again until I met him three days ago by coincidence in the library."Draco paused, his jaw working as he processed what she was telling him. He glanced around them, ensuring they were alone before brushing a strand of hair out of her face. For a moment Draco said nothing, just looked down at the girl before him. "He's flirty," Draco finally ground out. "I don't like it."Dahlia smiled softly at him, leaning into him subtly. He wasn't touching her, except for the hand that has moved the hair from her face. He tucked the strand behind her ear and let his hand rest gently near her neck, still tangled in her hair, careful not to be touching her skin. It was tantalizing, having him so close but not touching her."Does that mean that you were jealous?" Dahlia asked breathlessly, not daring to meet his eyes, her gaze on the hand in her hair.Draco moved his hand to lift her face up to his. He silently watched her as he tilted her face up to meet his. The butterflies in his stomach multiplied as she lifted her long eyelashes to meet his gaze. His breath caught in his throat; she was so beautiful. Her hair, pulled up in a messy bun today with small tendrils gently framing her face. She looked so... innocent. So soft.He almost said yes, and admitted his feelings for her, but instead he stiffened at the last moment, straightening up, pulling away several inches and he managed to fix her with a cold look. "No," he said curtly. "As if I would ever be jealous of someone you chose to be with."Dahlia's eyes flashed for a moment, disappointment flashing for a second before she challenged him. "I think you were," she whispered tauntingly as she lifted herself onto her tippy toes, drawing her face just that much closer to his. Draco froze at her boldness, at the way her body pushed against his. "I think the idea of me and Cedric together makes you jealous," Dahlia continued as she lifted her lips until they were a millimeter from his own. His beautiful grey eyes were locked onto hers as she looked up at him. "If you were jealous, you can kiss me."Malfoy physically faltered at the predicament he found himself in. Before he could collect his thoughts, his traitorous lips were already acting for him. His lips touched her softly, almost hesitantly. As suddenly as they were there, they were gone. Dahlia opened her eyes and was shocked to find herself standing alone in the library aisle.Dahlia was still walking on air when she entered the Great Hall for dinner. Thankfully she'd been done with classes for the day after her Library run in, as she'd spent the last several hours conflicted over the kiss. He ran; again! She huffed indignantly as she fastened her cloak tighter around her neck. The Slytherin-Ravenclaw match was this evening, and she was ecstatic to watch Draco play; she hadn't paid much attention to the sport since starting classes, but ever since she found out he was the Slytherin seeker, she decided it was worth her time to watch a game. Harry spent the whole dinner explaining the rules and going over the different positions until Dahlia felt her head would truly burst."You do realize I've read Quidditch Through the Ages, right, Harry?" Dahlia complained, looking at Harry boredly. "I do know how to play. I'm not Hermione," her tone was teasing as she shot a glance at the studious girl beside her, buried in a book."I get the gist of it," Hermione sniffed back, not glancing up from the book in her lap.They laughed, dismissing her from the conversation as Dahlia turned back to listen to Harry's ranting, drifting off into her head. Dahlia was still trying to decide if the library had truly happened earlier. It all felt like a dream. If she closed her eyes, she could still feel the way his lips brushed against hers, could still faintly smell his cologne. It was intoxicating, and frustrating all at once; why had he run away so fast?She tried to change the topic, addressing the Golden Trio in general. "Any chance you guys are going to the quidditch game after dinner?"Ron nodded, his mouth too full to speak. Hermione huffed at Ron's actions and answered for him, disdain in her voice. "The boys are going; I have homework so I'll most likely go to the library."Harry raised his eyebrows at Hermione, almost suggestively. "You've been at the library a lot lately. Do you really have that much homework?"Hermione's eyes flashed to Dahlia's, who immediately looked down. Hermione had sworn Dahlia to secrecy two days ago in the library when she had seen her and the Durmstrang champion Victor Krum together in the library. They'd been snogging, looking very cozy together in a hidden nook back amongst the book shelves. Hermione admitted to her that she was going to the Yule Ball with him, but begged her not to tell the boys so Dahlia hadn't said anything."Any of you got a date to the Yule Ball yet?" Fred or George Weasley's voice rang clear throughout the Great Hall. Hermione glanced to them, grateful for the interruption. Ron took that opportunity to unknowingly save her as he turned to Harry."Remember our deal?"Harry rolled his eyes, shoveling food into his mouth. "Yes, Ron. End of today."Dahlia looked between the boys, suspicion oozing from her as she slowly tried to make sense of their words. "What deal?"Harry sighed exasperatedly, glaring at Ron as though he had betrayed a secret. "We made a deal. Neither of us can come back to the common room tonight until we have a date."Dahlia rolled her eyes, snorting. "That's so stupid.""Not as stupid as it would be showing up alone!" Ron growled defensively at her, clearly offended by her words. "Who are you going with, anyways?" He asked scornfully, taking a large bite from his chicken leg.Dahlia fixed him with a cold gaze, cocking her brow at him. "None of your business."Ron smirked back at her, his voice disdainful. "No one then. I'm going to ask Fleur Delacour."Harry and Dahlia both spewed pumpkin juice at his words, Harry looking at him in shocked silence."Blimey, Ron, there's no way that's happening!" Dahlia exclaimed, stifling her laughter.Harry shook his head, his eyes still watering from restrained laughter as he clapped his best friend on the shoulder. "Yeah, mate, I'm not sure how that one will go."Ron huffed, looking sour as he glared at Harry. "Fine. Do you want to go, then?" He turned his attention to Dahlia."No, thanks, unlike you I think I would rather go alone." Dahlia snapped back scornfully, intending only for her Gryffindor friends to hear to snarky comeback, but unfortunately Malfoy and his friends happened to be walking by at that moment.Malfoy cat whistled as him and his group of Slytherins walked by, all of them chuckling. "Damn, Weasley, that's a rejection!"Ron's face turned bright red, and he pointedly ignored her for the remainder of the meal. Dahlia felt a moment of guilt, but pressed it down. Ron could be an ass sometimes, but he didn't usually stay mad for long. Once they had finished eating Hermione headed off to the library. Dahlia gave her a pointed look and a wink that had Hermione blushing on her way up the stairs."She's been acting weird," Ron mumbled at Hermione's back as they headed towards the Quidditch pitch. Dahlia didn't spare him a glance, determined to keep her friends secret.Harry ignored Ron's statement too, which made her wonder if maybe Harry was in on the secret as well. She dared not ask, so instead she treaded along in silence. They made their way to the stands, climbing up to the top stands for the best view. They found good seats right behind the Ravenclaw goal, all three sitting down, Harry in the middle and Ron to his left, Dahlia to his right."Harry!" Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister, along with Neville and Luna Lovegood were seated a few seats down from them, waving eagerly for Harry to come join them. Harry stood, excusing himself and left to speak to them. Ron seemed more upset than earlier now that he was left alone with Dahlia, so he turned surley and pointedly ignored her. Dahlia ignored him back, staring at the ground as the players lined up.Dahlia was watching the ground on the pitch as Madam Hooch lined the players up for the kick off. She strained her neck, trying to pinpoint which green player was Malfoy. She finally spotted him, on the far side of the pitch, behind the rest of his team on the line up. To her surprise, he was scanning the stands as though looking for her.His eyes landed on her, and she raised a hand in greeting. The briefest smile flashed across his face before his expression turned dark, and he jerked his attention back to the field. Dahlia leaned back, curious as what could have changed his demeanor when a hand on her shoulder drew her attention."Hey! Sorry, I couldn't find you." Cedric stood in front of her, an apologetic smile on his face. "I didn't know you had already found a seat!""Oh!" Dahlia stumbled for words, completely caught off guard by his appearance. In light of the Draco library event earlier she had completely forgotten she had agreed to meet Cedric at the stadium for the game. "I'm so sorry! I walked in with Harry and Ron.""Oh, no worries," Cedric took a seat next to her, between her and Ron. Madam Hooch's whistle sounded, announcing the start of the game. The players kicked off the ground, taking to their air with Ravenclaw in possession of the quaffle.Dahlia watched, nervously on her toes as the bludgers flew around, knocking players off their brooms. Malfoy had one particularly close call with a bludger a few minutes into the game. She saw the charmed ball coming behind him and was on her feet in an instant, screaming with the rest of the Slytherin spectators."Malfoy! Behind you!" She screamed, knowing her voice was probably lost in the crowd of students cheering. He somehow avoided the flying ball, narrowly swerving to avoid it. His eyes caught hers the second after. For one second the world froze as his eyes met hers, and then Cedric's arm came crashing around her shoulders, pulling her down. His weight pulled her all the way to the ground, breaking her eye contact with Draco.Before Dahlia could protest a bludger tore through the stands, knocking into several people around them as it went. It narrowly missed them; Cedric's quick action saved both of them from a few broken bones at the very least."Sorry!" Cedric yelled over the noise as he helped Dahlia back to her feet. "Bludger!" He said apologetically, giving her one of his prized smiles.Dahlia nodded, smiling her thanks as she turned back to watch the game. The score was now 70-30 Slytherin, and the snitch was nowhere in sight. They were only ten minutes into the game, which meant fifty minutes left to find it. Professional quidditch games would go on indefinitely until the Snitch was found; but school events were limited to an hour of game time. Harry had passionately explained how unfair that was for at least fifteen minutes at dinner, she recalled with snort.All of a sudden a shout went out from the crowd around them. Someone had spotted the snitch! Dahlia jumped to her feet, craning her neck as she watched, breathless, as Draco dive bombed toward the ground, his hand outstretched. Her heart stopped, a shriek leaving Dahlia's lips as he neared the ground. Dahlia squealed, certain he was flying to his death when Draco jerked his broom upwards at the last possible second, the snitch clasped in his uplifted hand.The Slytherin stands erupted into cheers, Dahlia cheering along with them as Lee Jordan's voice boomed over the announcer's speakers."Final score! 220-30 Slytherin! One of the fastest games we've seen in the past decade!" Dahlia bounced up and down, clapping her hands and cheering for the Slytherin team as they landed on the ground.Dahlia strained her neck to see as the handsome seeker landed his broomstick and was enveloped in a team hug. Dahlia smiled, watching the team celebrate when Draco's head lifted. She watched him search the stands until he saw her. A smile slid across his face and he lifted the snitch in his hand. Dahlia laughed and beamed at him, raising her hand as she cheered his name. Malfoy's gaze was torn away, back to the celebration with his team as Slytherin house started charging onto the field, lifting the entire Slytherin Quidditch team onto their shoulders.Dahlia sighed, turning back to the Hufflepuff beside her, face lifted in a smile. "That was a good game.""Yeah," Cedric was looking at her oddly, almost curiously. "It was. Walk back to the castle with me?"Dahlia hesitated, glancing back at the field to where the Slytherin team was still celebrating, with no sign of leaving soon. She turned back to the handsome boy in front of her, knowing tonight was not the night to get a moment alone with Draco. She resigned herself to that fact as she smiled."Yeah, sure."Together they set off across down the stairs of the stands and through the grounds. They chatted amicably as they walked, the time passing quickly until they were entering the castle.The pair was talking about the quickly approaching ball when they entered the doors to Hogwarts. A commotion drew their attention; Ginny Weasley was attempting to help a very pale, shaky Ron up the stairs. A small gathering of people were following them, laughing softly and talking amongst themselves."What happened?" Dahlia rushed forward, pushing through the group of students until she at Ginny's side. Cedric pushed his way through the crowd a moment later, throwing Ron's other arm around his neck and helping Ginny get him up the stairs.Ginny grimaced, looking grimly at Ron and then back to them. "Ron asked Fleur Delacour out."Dahlia gasped, her hand clapping over her mouth in an attempt to hide her amusement. "Oh, no," she turned to Ron, eyes wide. "You know she's part Veela, right? I told you not to do this!""He knows now," Ginny said, briefly explaining what had happened. Dahlia did her best to not laugh, though her eyes gave away her merriment as Ginny cackled whilst telling the story."Shut up," Ron snapped at Ginny and Dahlia. He glared at his sister before addressing Dahlia. "It's not like you could do any better anyways. No one's asked you to go to the ball." Ron sported a sneer that even Malfoy would have been proud of, his voice haughty to match. Dahlia stiffened, exhaling sharply. Before she could snark back at Ron, the Fleur's voice could be heard from behind them."Ze audacity. Why can't I go alone? Why must I go with a man to zis Ball," she sneered the last word as if it was a dirty word. Ron turned paler at the sound of her voice, almost whimpering.An idea popped in Dahlia's head, and she turned to smirk at Ron. "Maybe I don't need someone to ask me to the ball." Dahlia stood up, backing away from Cedric, Ron, and Ginny. She called out to the French witch as she approached her, feeling the eyes of her friends on her back."Hey, Fleur!"The pale blonde witch turned to Dahlia, surprised. "Yes?""I agree; going to the ball with a guy is stupid. Why don't we go to the ball together?" The words were out of Dahlia's mouth before she could stop them. Fleur's face morphed to one of shock, and for three painstaking seconds Dahlia thought she was about to get turned down, but then a beautiful smile spread across Fleur's face, the Veela's blue eyes dancing with merriment. "Yes! It is Dahlia, right?"Dahlia nodded, smiling in relief as she beamed. "Yes!""I like this idea," Fleur grinned, looping her arm through Dahlia's. "To hell with tradition, and with men.""Agreed," Dahlia shared a smile with her date. "I'll see you Friday night at the ball?""Yes!" Fleur agreed, releasing Dahlia's arm. "Great Hall at 8:00!"With that Fleur spun on her heel, her entourage on her heels, and strode through the Great Hall with her head held high. Dahlia turned back to her friends and was surprised to see them all staring at her, jaws hanging."Blood hell," Ginny was flabbergasted. "You just asked out Fleur Delacour.""And she said yes," Cedric whispered, in awe."Ha!" One second later Ginny was on the ground laughing so hard she was snorting. Ron glared sourly at her, but Ginny's merriment was contagious, It was several minutes before Ginny regained her composure enough to get Ron up the stairs and to the Gryffindor common room.The story of how Dahlia asked out Fleur Delacour spread like wildfire through the Gryffindor common room. The entire house was in an uproar, even first years laughed so hard they cried. Ron did not find it amusing, at all, and chalked it all up to me being a girl and Fleur being very "pro-women".Dahlia however, found it strangely comforting to make a choice like that. She no longer dreaded the Yule Ball, in fact, she had already picked out a dress. One that would stun everyone there.

It was two days to the Yule Ball, and Dahlia hadn't seen Malfoy since the quidditch match. She still bumped into Cedric in the library, and sometimes he hung out at her table, sometimes he didn't. She never concerned herself if he didn't; there seemed to be a certain Ravenclaw girl he had his eye on since the Ravenclaw/Slytherin match. She didn't mind; just kept an eye out for a particularly handsome Slytherin.Who, once again, seemed to have gone into hiding. Dahlia was frustrated as she stormed across the castle towards her dormitory, muttering curses to herself as she stomped."Dumbledore!" A whisper caught her ear and she turned to see Draco Malfoy next to the gargoyle that led to the Owlery tower."Malfoy," she spoke indifferently as she slowed her steps, eyeing him suspiciously.Silently he gestured at the gargoyle, a silent invitation to follow him to the tower. For a moment, Dahlia considered saying no. At her hesitation she saw a flicker of doubt shadow Draco's face, and she made up her her mind.She nodded silently, leaning in to whisper the password to the Gargoyle. It jumped aside, and Draco followed her into the passageway. Neither of them spoke as they walked until they reached the end. Dahlia's heart pounded, but her dignity demanded he speak first - he break the silence."I saw you at the game," Malfoy's voice was hesitant, as if he wasn't sure how to begin a conversation with her.Dahlia's eyes sparkled with excitement, a smile breaking out across her face. "I was there! You played brilliantly!" She beamed at him as she spoke, and Malfoy felt the conviction in her words. His throat clogged up, realizing that she was proud of him.Draco looked down, embarrassment tinging his cheeks. He was uncomfortable with the praise so he shrugged. "It wasn't that big of a deal,""Yes, it was!" Dahlia insisted, turning to face him, giving him a nudge with her shoulder. "You caught that snitch in less than 10 minutes! Other than Harry's record, that's the best one the school has!"Draco drank in the details of her face as she beamed at him, caught off guard by her reaction. She was so sweet, so full of joy. He'd expected anger; after all, he'd run off after kissing her. He smiled at her, brushing a rully curl out of her face, his voice husky.. "I'm glad you liked watching me play.""Oh, I loved it," she reassured him as she turned away from him to activate the passageway door. . "You'll have to teach me how to fly like that."Malfoy smiled at her back as she pressed the brick and made her way into the Letter Room. "It took me years to learn."Dahlia tossed him a glance over her shoulder coyly, "I'm a quick learner." The wink that accompanied her words had his heart skipping beats. He waited until she was situated in a chair before settling himself in the chair across from her, trying to make himself appear busy so he didn't have to respond to her comment."Are you going to the ball?" Dahlia asked the question hesitantly, as if scared of his answer. The ball was two days away, and it was all anyone was talking about at this point."It's required," Draco reminded her with an eye roll. "Stupid Wizard Tournament."Dahlia laughed, her head rolling back to rest on the back of her chair. It was nice to hear someone else complain about having to go. Hermione was over the moon about it. "I'm not exactly looking forward to it."Draco raised his brow at her. "You seem like the type who would enjoy these things."Dahlia shook her head firmly, a smile tugging at her lips. "No, I didn't even own the right kind of dress for this thing. I had to go buy one."Draco's eyebrows shot up, settling back in his chair as he looked her up and down. "Oh, really?"Dahlia smirked at him, leaving the air of mystery to the matter as she shrugged, blushing under his gaze. Draco's eyes hardened a moment later his voice losing all signs of merriment."Did he ask you?" Draco's voice was guarded, his eyes flickering nervously from her face down to his hands. His heart pounded in his chest as he waited for her answer. Draco shifted anxiously, hearing her soft gasp of surprise. The ball was two days away, it was highly likely that Diggory had already asked her, and if he did it was Malfoy's own stupid fault. He mentally face palmed himself. Who walks away from a girl after kissing her? Ignores her for days? She probably was going to the ball with someone else, and served him right for it.Dahlia felt the tension in the room spike as Malfoy shifted uncomfortably. "What?" His words caught her off guard.Malfoy hesitated as though he didn't have the courage to ask again. "Diggory," his voice was gruff, his eyes avoiding her hers. "Did he ask you already?""Oh," Dahlia realized what was happening, her face softening into a demure smile. "No, Malfoy, he never asked me."Draco's head snapped up in surprise, shock in his gaze. "Really?" His grey eyes burned into her, absorbing the truth in her eyes. The heart wrenching pain in his gut never came as he basked in relief. She was telling the truth - he could see it on her face. Her ambers eyes didn't skirt away from his, meeting him timidly but determinedly."I mean, Ron asked me, but I shot him down." Her voice wavered a little, as though nervous.Malfoy smirked, "I was there for that one.""Right." Dahlia blushed, building up the courage for the words she had to say next."Does that mean -""But I did ask someone else to go," Dahlia's eyes widened when she realized she had interrupted him. His gaze went from happy and hopeful, to guarded and angry in a split second. For a moment neither spoke, Dahlia horrified with the realization he'd been about to ask her to go, Draco struck dumb by the thought that she'd asked someone."You asked someone?" He stared at her incredulously as though he couldn't believe her words."Yes," Dahlia answered defiantly, crossing her arms. "Why do you look so surprised?"Malfoy snorted sarcastically, shaking his head. His gaze leveled with hers, "Any guy who made you ask him to the ball doesn't deserve you, Dumbledore." With that he pushed himself up from his chair, and left the Owlery tower._The ball was in a few short hours, and it was time to begin getting ready. Hermione and Dahlia had agreed to get ready together weeks ago, and both woke the morning of the ball excited. They chattered easily as they did each other's hair, both choosing a half up- half down style with soft curls framing their faces. Hermione's hair required more time and manipulation with their magical hair products, but even her hair was shiny and perfectly curled by the time Dahlia was through with it.Dahlia had chosen a two piece emerald dress that showed several inches of her navel. The top was low cut, giving her breasts a much more generous effect than usual. Her pierced belly button was visible, the silver dangle ornament flashing in the light. The skirt was tight around her hips, and flowed loosely past her ass. A thigh high slit up the right thigh gave her room to move. She had paired the dress with a simple pair of black heels, and simple hoop earrings and necklace.Hermione's dress was a fitted baby blue, that trailed to the ground and flowed behind her like a princess dress. Her accessories were gold, and she opted for nude heels but the effect was the same.By 8:00 that night both girls were dressed to the nines, hair and make-up flawless, dresses swishing elegantly by their feet as they descended the stairs towards the Great Hall.A rustle in the crowd drew their attention, and Dahlia watched as the entire Great Hall watched her and Hermione enter. Her heart started pounding as everyone's heads turned, staring, the girls whispering amongst themselves. The guys seemed to have no words, just ogling at them as they descended. Hermione and Dahlia shared a nervous glance as they came to the bottom step. Victor Krum came to his senses first, marching proudly forward to offer Hermione his arm. She accepted it with a nervous smile, and Dahlia watched as her friend was whirled away with a small wave back to her.Dahlia scanned the crowd around her for Fleur, not having anticipated Hermione leaving her so quickly. Where was Fleur? Dahlia started when her eyes latched onto familiar grey eyes. Dahlia's eyes widened as she took in the Slytherin Prince; he looked dashing. Draco was dressed in simple black dress robes with silver buttons. His necktie was emerald green, perfectly matched to her dress - something she most definitely had not planned. His hair was neatly done, falling complimentary across his forehead and face. Her breath caught at the sight of how handsome he was, and for a moment she forgot she was looking for someone.Draco couldn't breathe. How was he supposed to breathe when she looked like that? His eyes were going to pop out of his head any moment now. He cursed under his breath as he stared, mesmerized by her beauty. Her long black hair was very curly tonight, piled elegantly onto her head with curls cascading around her face and down her back. She had chosen an emerald dress that made her amber eyes flash. The dress hugged her curves, accentuating her breasts nicely. He let his gaze roam further down, hungry for more. Draco's mouth went dry when he saw her tone abs, and belly button piercing. He jerked his eyes up to meet her gaze once again, and she smirked at him, raising her brows as if to say, How do I look?Draco opened his mouth to speak, and found himself unable to form words. Instead he just looked at her, wishing more than anything he had been man enough to ask her to this stupid ball weeks ago.A tug on his arm jerked his attention away from Dahlia. Pansy Parkinson, his unfortunate date for the evening, wrapped her hand around his arm. Draco dared a glance back at Dahlia, and found her glaring at him with a cold murderous look, the shy, playful look gone.He held her stare, unwilling to back down. She was here with someone else, and so was he. Malfoy secretly cursed himself. He hadn't asked Pansy to go with him until last night, knowing he wouldn't be able to stand watching Dahlia in someone else's arms all night. Satisfaction boiled inside him, secretly glad Dahlia stood unclaimed at the foot of the steps, apparently waiting on her date. Pansy tugged on his arm, arching up to whisper in his ear."Can we go in now, Draco?" Malfoy shivered at Pansy's proximity, hating the way her breath on his neck caused him to wince away. He hated himself for asking her, but she had been his last option, and he treated her as such. Pansy seemed not to notice his reaction, choosing to pull his arm closer to her, and pull his earlobe into her mouth, murmuring dirty things into his ear.Draco flinched, not bothering to see if Dahlia was looking. He could feel her furious glare on the side of his head as he glanced down at the witch beside him. Pansy was taller than Dahlia by several inches, something Draco seemed to notice immensely. The moment in the Library replayed in his head, his breath catching. His eyes flickered closed as he remembered the intoxicating smell of her, the soft skin of her lips as kissed them. The kiss that left him wanting more - regretting not pushing her up against the wall and snogging her senseless.He vowed then and there to kiss her properly, if ever given the chance again. A small, annoying moan from Pansy jolted him back to reality as Pansy pulled away from his neck, sliding an arm around his waist possessively. Draco frowned down at her, realizing he might not get the chance with Dahlia again after this.Despite the panic in his chest at that thought Draco forced it from his mind, turning his attention to Pansy, determined to forget Dahlia no matter how beautiful she looked, or how angry she was. He felt Pansy's lips travel down his neck, and he ignored her, neither encouraging or discouraging it. His traitorous eyes flickered to Dahlia, finding her frozen in the same place she'd been a minute previous, the bottom of the stairs, clinging to the hand rail.He caught her murderous stare for half of a second before Dahlia turned away from them, a sneer on her face. He lost sight of her in the crowd as she stepped down the final steps and strode off in the opposite direction.Dahlia huffed loudly to herself as she made her way through the crowd, glancing around desperately for Fleur. How dare he act like that, as though he wasn't kissing her in the library a few days ago! Tears of betrayal threatened to fall, her anger building when suddenly a voice rang out. "Dahlia, you look beautiful!"Dahlia turned to see Fleur approaching her, arms outstretched, smiling warming at her. Dahlia exhaled in relief, rushing forward to embrace the french girl warmly, smirking when she caught Draco watching their exchange, a curious expression falling across his face."I'm so excited; are you ready for the dance?" Fleur kissed her on both cheeks before taking Dahlia's hand in hers and pulling her into the Great Hall eagerly. Dahlia clung to her hand, but allowed Fleur to lead her until they were standing near the dance floor, directly behind Harry and his date, Parvati."I guess so," Dahlia spoke nervously. "I don't really know how to dance."Fleur turned to her in shock, hands flying to cover her mouth in surprise. "Surely someone told you! The champions and their dates must dance the first dance!"Dahlia's jaw dropped, her stomach rolling with nausea as she shook her head. "Wh-what?"Fleur looked at the panic rising in Dahlia's eyes before patting her hand comfortingly. "No, no, no, do not worry. It is a simple dance. Follow my lead and you will be fine."Dahlia highly doubted she was going to be fine. More like she was going to make a fool out of herself in front of all three schools. Begrudgingly, she allowed Fleur to pull her through the Great Hall towards the back where the teachers had begun to assemble the champions. Fleur spoke quickly as they walked, trying to explain the gists of the dance."Right, Mr. Diggory and Miss Chang, you will go in first. Mr. Krum, Miss Granger will enter second." Professor McGonagall stood before the champions, arranging them in the correct order."Ladies, on the right, gentlemen on the left please!" McGonagall peered over her spectacles at the two girls. "Miss Delacour, you are very nearly late," the transfiguration professor chided."Hey, Harry!" Dahlia called softly, waving to Harry and Hermione as McGonagall directed her and Fleur to their correct spots in line."Miss Dumbledore, you are aware that this line is for the champions and their dates?" Mcgonagall spoke impatiently, realizing as though for the first time who she was escorting into line."Yes, professor, I-""Then what, pray tell, are you doing here?" McGonagall was impatient, snapping crossly at Dahlia."She is my date, professor." Fleur spoke quickly, glancing around at the looks of shock on the other champions faces. She spoke timidly, yet firm as she addressed the cross Professor.McGonagall appeared speechless for a moment, but quickly recovered. "I suppose it doesn't matter what side you ladies stand on, then" Professor Mcgonagall said with a sniff. Fleur managed to hide her laugh behind a cough as the professor moved away to fuss over Harry's jacket. Dahlia's eyes were wide with merriment, clasping onto Fleur's arms as the Professor walked away.Fleur eyes were shining with merriment as she giggled. "I am so glad we did this!"Dahlia joined Fleur in laughing before they were silenced, and The First Dance celebration of the Yule Ball began. The Dining Hall had completely been redone for the Yule Ball, and tonight it looked like a winter wonderland. Fake snow fell from the ceilings, snow covered Christmas trees tiered high above the tables, which had been pushed to line the walls, opening the room up into a large dance floor.Cedric and Cho walked out first, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw bursting into cheers for their champion. It was apparently no secret that the two of them were now officially an item, causing quite a stir amongst the female students. Other tables hushed the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables as the next champion emerged.The whispers in the crowds began as Krum and Hermione made their appearance. All the girls in the room were applauding Hermione, whooping and cat-calling. Hermione buried her face in Krum's shoulder from embarrassment, notably laughing and waving as Krum escorted her proudly down the aisle. Durmstrang students stomped their feet and cheered for their champion, louder than any other school.The cheers quieted a moment before Harry and Padma Patil walked out next, the crowd politely clapping for them, while mostly the Gryffindor's cheered. The entire Gryffindor house erupted into cheers, Parvati waving gleefully to her twin sister who was on scowling Ron's arm. Dahlia was so caught up watching that she almost didn't hear Fleur's name be called.There was a moment of silence, and then McGonagall gave Dahlia and Fleur a slight nudge that sent them walking down the aisle. Fleur stood on Dahlia's left, their hands intertwined, stepping forward hesitantly. When they first entered the room it was silent, and then the room erupted with roars. All of the boys were cat-calling and whistling, even the Durmstrang students went wild. Dahlia couldn't even find her friends in the sea of students cheering and pushing towards them. Loudest of all was the Beauxbatons, a haunting song wafting up as they paid tribute to their champion. Dahlia laughed at the catcalls and cheers her and Fleur received as they sashayed down the aisle.Halfway down, Dahlia's sweeping gaze caught Draco's eye, surprised to find him at the front of the crowd, eyes widened in laughter and surprise. His face morphed into a question, looking at her incredulously as though to say, This is who you asked?!Dahlia gave him a slight shrug and a wink, before turning her attention to the cheering crowd around her. As her and Fleur reached the dance floor, the cheers continued despite the faculty's attempts to silence them. Fleur laughed, her arm snaking around Dahlia's waist. Dahlia returned the favor, pulling the french witch close to her, laughing with her."Is it a show you want?" The veela asked the crowd over her shoulder seductively. The crowd burst out in cheers and whoops. Dahlia laughed as Fleur lifted her hand up to her face, biting her lipas she cupped Dahlia's face."If it's a show they want, it's a show they get," and Fleur leaned down, planting her lips on Dahlia's. For half a second Dahlia didn't know how to react, and then she was cupping Fleur's face and kissing her back. Fleur's lips were soft and inviting, Dahlia stepping closer to tangle a hand in the blonde locks that tumbled down her back. Fleur responded in kind, cupping Dahlia's ass as her tongue slipped into her mouth.Dahlia was so entangled with Fleur she almost didn't hear the rambunctious cheers. The Dining Hall had never been so noisy as it was when the girls broke apart, grinning sheepishly at the frowning professors. Fleur blew a kiss to the crowd as she half bowed to her headmistress. "My apologies, it's the veela in me."The professors seemed to want to dismiss the last minute all together, so instead of responding to the display of affection, the music started, and the Champion's Dance began. Much to her surprise, Dahlia found she was a natural. Fleur was an excellent lead, always whispering helpful instructions when needed.They made it through the first dance before more people began to join them on the dance floor. Fleur and Dahlia danced for thirty minutes together as the music shifted from traditional to more recent songs."Come with me!" Fleur grabbed Dahlia's hand and pulled her off the dance floor. Dahlia watched breathlessly as the veela searched through a bag in the corner of the room before producing a bottle. She offered it to Dahlia who took it gingerly."It's firewhiskey," Fleur explained as Dahlia took a generous swig. She shuddered against the burning sensation in her throat, causing Fleur to laugh. "It hurts the first few sips, but after that you don't feel it anymore."Dahlia took her word for it, helping herself to several more swigs before getting to her feet. She offered her date her hand, and pulled her back out onto the dance floor, the bottle still collapsed in her hand.The fire-whiskey took effect quickly, and Dahlia found herself dancing alone on the dance floor. She'd been previously dancing with Ginny and Hermione, both of whom had grouped off with their dates now. Fleur had gotten pulled away by a handsome Durmstrang wizard, so Dahlia swayed her hips on the dance floor alone, content to enjoy the music alone. She sashayed her hips, spinning in a circle as her hands drifted up. Dahlia's eyes drifted closed as her head fell back, her body moving to the beat of the music.Suddenly a hand appeared on her waist, pulling her against someone. Dahlia gasped, eyes flying open, turning around to find an older Hufflepuff boy she hadn't seen before. He continued to dance, his hands planted on her hips tightly, silent encouragement to continue swaying her hips.Dahlia paused for a second, hesitant to dance so intimately with someone that wasn't one of her girlfriends... or Draco. She hated that he was the only guy that had popped into her head to dance with. He shouldn't be having this type of affect on her. She braced her arms against the Hufflepuff's shoulders, pushing away slightly. The boy's hold on her tightened, Dahlia glancing around quickly for anyone who could be watching.As though she summoned him Draco suddenly appeared in front of her. He had a scowl on his face as he advanced towards this, his hands clenched into fists, grey eyes glistening with anger.Dahlia turned to the boy gripping her waist in an attempt to diffuse the situation before Malfoy interjected. "I don't want to dance.""But you're dancing," the boy objected, his hands sliding up her hips to her ribs. Dahlia opened her mouth to retort back, preparing to move away from him when it happened."By that," a familiar voice drawled, clipped and heavy with anger, "I believe she means she doesn't want to dance with you." Draco stared at the Hufflepuff, daring the boy to challenge him. Malfoy was several inches taller than the boy, easily out matching him in weight by at least fifty pounds. The Hufflepuff seemed to think this was more trouble than it was worth, moving away through the crowd with a mumbled apology.Dahlia turned her attention back to Draco, who was looking at her with an odd look on his face. She smiled sweetly at him as she began to sway her hips along with the music again, keeping eye contact with the Slytherin boy in front of her as her hips dipped lower. His eyes crawled along her body, watching her dance, his eyes darkening.Dahlia watched as he loosened the tie around his neck as she spun around, facing her back to him as she bent over, twerking. A growl escaped Draco's throat as he closed the distance between them, his hands finding their way to the bare skin of her stomach, hesitantly at first, as though she'd refuse his attempts like she had the previous boy. When she allowed his touch, his hands gripped her waist more steadily, more possessively."You're drunk," Draco whispered roughly against her ear as she ground her ass against him, head falling back on his shoulder."Maybe a little," she said coyly as she glanced back at him over her shoulder, leaning forward as she moved to the sway of the music. Draco grimaced at the sparks of attraction that shot through him every time she rolled her hips against him. He couldn't resist grinding with her, following the movements her hips made. He did a quick scan of the room, but all near-by students seemed to not care - or were too drunk to care that Slytherin's Royal was dancing with Dumbledore's Ward. Everyone seemed to be occupied, so he gave in and let himself have this moment.His hands trailed down her waist, gripping the folds of her dress in his fists as she leaned back against him. "You are breathtaking in green." His voice was husky, full of lust, his grey eyes demanding and hungry.She spun around to face him, her arms going around his neck, nose to nose with him. She dragged her hands across his shoulder and down his arm, sending chill bumps racing across his skin. He stifled a moan as she spun back around, back her ass back up against him."Keep this up and we're leaving," Draco warned as Dahlia let go and began to shake her ass to the music. Her only response was a playful smirk as one of her friends came up to her and started dancing with her.Draco watched, unsure whether he was more turned on or amused by the sight in front of him. Dahlia was grinding on him, with her friend dancing on her. Dahlia paid him no mind, grinding with her friend in front of her. He let himself get lost in the moment, dancing with Dahlia, feeling happier than he had in a long time.Dahlia got his attention when she spun around, her fingers playing with the edge of his dress pants. She stumbled slightly, and he reached out to steady her, arms wrapping around her waist to support her."How much did you have to drink?" Draco murmured in her ear as she leaned against his chest. Thankfully the band chose that moment to play a slow song, so he simply shifted her to the center of his chest and swayed back and forth to the music, giving Dahlia a moment to collect herself."I don't know," Dahlia whispered back, lifting her face to place chaste kisses along his collar bone. Electric shocks tickled his skin every where her lips touched, trailing a line of fire. His grip on her waist tightened instinctively, swallowing the moan that almost escaped his lips."Dahlia," Draco's voice held an edge of warning as he turned his lustful gaze on her, pushing her away enough to hold her at arm's length away. "Not here."Her soft moan was almost his undoing, but it was her words that had him moving. "Then take me somewhere else."She met his eyes, clear and unwavering. Draco's heart skipped a beat; not sparring a second thought. He grabbed her hand and led her from the Great Hall, ducking immediately into a passage way that delivered them to the third floor corridors. He walked quickly, glancing around occasionally to ensure there weren't students or teachers nearby. Dahlia followed behind him as quickly as she could, a little wobbly on her feet, but sober enough to know she needed to be quiet. They had almost reached his intended destination when Dahlia stopped walking, jerking him to a stop with her.Draco turned to give her a questioning look, but before he got the chance she launched herself at him, tangling her arms around his neck, crashing her lips to his.He didn't hesitate. He buried his hands in her curly hair, gathering it in handfuls as he explored her mouth. Her ragged breaths spurred him on as he sucked her bottom lip between his teeth, drawing a moan from her. Her legs wrapped around his waist, supporting her as he wrapped an arm around her waist, anchoring her tightly to him. Her moan left him shaking as trailed kisses down her neck, Dahlia's head rolling back with a gasp of pleasure. Her breaths were pants now as he kissed lower and lower along the line of her dress, teasingly, tauntingly.Voices coming down the hall drew their attention and they froze where they were, Draco holding Dahlia gently against the wall with her arms tangled around his neck. Both were panting as they looked at each other, and for a moment Dahlia noticed a hint of doubt in Draco's eyes, as if he expected her to push him away.Dahlia instead pressed her lips against his in reassurance, but couldn't resist the urge to tease him. "I thought you were upset that I had asked someone else to the ball."Draco's lips curved up in a smile, leading them towards his final destination. They reached the end of the corridor, and he led her down a small stairwell that ended in a small room with a large window.The view from the window was beautiful, you could see the snow falling across the entire grounds, all the way to the lake. The Forbidden Forest lay to the left, dark and looming, strange creatures flying about in the skies above them."It's beautiful," Dahlia breathed, embracing Draco as his arms slid around her waist from behind.Her arms wrapped around his neck, her forehead turned to lean against his jaw. He peppered light kisses across her collarbone and neck until she turned around to face him, hungrily nipping at his lips. His heart skipped a beat at her eagerness; he couldn't resist her.He indulged her, passionately meeting her lips with his. He groaned as he tugged her closer to his body, the taste of her intoxicating him. She answered in kind, hand sliding tauntingly down his chest, lingering over his belt on his pants. He stifled a groan, gentling his kiss as he pulled away. He didn't deserve her yet - she just didn't know it. He leaned his forehead against hers, nuzzling his nose against hers in a butterfly kiss."I was an idiot," Draco admitted softly, meeting her hooded eyes with lustful grey orbs. "I got jealous. The idea of you dancing with another guy... clearly that doesn't go over well."Dahlia stifled a giggle as she nuzzled down into Draco's chest. Anchoring herself securely to his waist, face buried in his chest. Her actions stunned him - he'd never been embraced like this before. Slowly, his arms circled around her, tightening as her voice drifted up to his ears."Can we agree to talk more, from here on out? Rather than not talking for days at a time?" She turned her green eyes to the Slytherin, pleading softly, weakly. "I hate not talking to you," she admitted. He knew it was probably the alcohol that had her talking like this, but in the moment he didn't care. He didn't think he could refuse her anything, in this moment.Draco's response was to pull her closer to him, burying his face in her neck, content to just hold her. "Yes," he agreed. After tonight there was no way he would be able to not speak to her anyways. He didn't want to. That thought resonated deep, causing him to inhale, quickly looking around to ensure they were truly alone. If he was going to be with her, he couldn't be seen with her. Draco swore that then and there; she wouldn't ever be in danger because of him. She would know nothing of his family and he would not let them use her as a pawn in their sick games."Let's get you back to your common room," Draco murmured into her hair as he stroked her back. His best bet to get Dahlia back unnoticed with to get her back before anyone left the ball."No," Dahlia whined pitifully, clutching his shirt in her hands. She moaned, scowling up at him. "You realize this is the first time we have had a conversation that didn't go bad?"Draco chuckled as he dropped feather light kisses on her lips, hating how he craved more the moment he pulled away. "Have you considered that maybe it's because you're drunk?"Dahlia shrugged, grinning sheepishly at him. "That's not it. I'm seriously not that drunk. Anymore," she added sheepishly.Draco laughed in spite of himself, shaking his head with a roll of his eyes. He pulled her close, kissing her forehead affectionately. "C'mon, Lia, let's get you to bed."Dahlia blushed at the use of her shortened name, but allowed him to lead her down the corridors and to her common room. He left her standing outside the Fat Lady's portrait, leaving a chaste kiss on her lips and a promise to talk to her tomorrow.Dahlia stumbled to bed as if in a trance, crawling beneath the covers only mere minutes before her friends, praying that tonight had been real and not a dream.

The following day was the start of Christmas break with many students leaving for the holidays to visit their families. Dahlia had forgotten that most students returned home for the holidays until everyone's trunks appeared at breakfast with them, ready for departure to the trains. Draco as it turns out, unfortunately, was a part of that group. He approached her before breakfast the morning after the ball to tell her his parents had owled, requesting him home for the holidays. They hadn't had time for more than a few second interaction - he hadn't even kissed her, leaving her wondering if maybe he had doubted their moment the night before.Dahlia has tried to hide her disappointment, but she knew Draco caught a glimpse of it even though she assured him they would see each other after break. She'd scurried straight to breakfast, arriving with Ginny. Thankfully, the boys were too upset with Hermione after her surprise Yule Ball date last night to have noticed her strange disappearances. Breakfast passed quickly, Hermione jerking Dahlia's hand up halfway through the meal and dragging her back to Gryffindor Tower. Ron was being particularly nasty about Hermione's date, and while Hermione couldn't see why, Dahlia didn't have the heart to tell her. Instead, she listened comfortingly, helped her friend pack her remaining clothes, and then escorted her back down to the carriages for the trains.The students were departing for the train any minute, and Dahlia stood at the entrance to Hogwarts searching the crowds for any sign of the platinum blonde Slytherin. She'd said goodbye to Harry, Ron, and Hermione several minutes ago; their carriage had already rolled away.She was beginning to lose faith that Draco would keep his word from earlier and see her before he left.A hand grabbed her gently from behind, spinning her around until her back was against the wall, tucked behind the door out of sight. Dahlia gasped, eyes widening in surprise as a hand clamped over her mouth, silencing any noise she made."You didn't think I would leave without saying goodbye, did you?" Draco pouted, his hand sliding down from her mouth to cup her jaw. Dahlia's face blossomed into a smile as she beamed up at him, all regret leaving his mind. He had wrestled with himself all night about his actions with Dahlia last night, only to find that as much as he wanted to - as much as he should regret it- he didn't. Not even a little bit."I was getting worried," Dahlia admitted as he caressed her face with his thumb. Her hands trailed up from his waist to his shoulders, gripping the shirt fabric into her fists."No need to worry," Draco said huskily as he lowered his lips to hers. The kiss was slow, sweet, full of promises. He felt her pulse accelerate under his grip; her hands sliding down his back, pulling at the fabric as though to remove his shirt. He knew it was completely crazy for him to give into this; her blood status itself was enough to drive them apart in his parents world. She wasn't a mudblood, but it was technically unknown, which would be the equivalent. She had no name, no inheritance, no prestigious upbringing. Despite all of that, he just couldn't help himself as he kissed her lips one more time, hungrily. They broke apart slowly, Dahlia resenting having to pull away from him. He tugged her forward until she was wrapped in his arms, tucked securely into his shoulder."It's only three weeks," Draco reminded her gently as she clung to his shirt. He nuzzled the top of her head."I know," she groaned, leaning her forehead against his chest. "It's just... we just started..." she gave up with an exacerbated sigh, glancing up at him, almost crossed."I think what you're trying to say was I was an idiot and couldn't get my head out of ass until literally the last second, wasting months where we could have been together?" His voice dropped lower as he spoke, slowly leaning in to kiss her neck, trailing kisses up to her jaw until he landed on her lips again, stealing a slow kiss from her."Exactly," she gasped as she squirmed under his hands, her own hands exploring his chest and back, pecking his lips back. He was inclined to stay there and kiss her behind the door all day, but somewhere outside the castle Hagrid could be heard yelling about "Last call for carriages!"Dahlia winced, knowing that meant her time with Draco had come to an end. She gave him one last lingering kiss before stepping away from him, straightening her clothes. "Don't cause too much trouble," she said as she offered him a brave smile as he fixed his tie."I'll try," Draco dropped one last goodbye kiss on her lips, remorseful to have to leave her. He turned and walked out the front steps, willing himself to not look back at the girl he was leaving behind.Christmas break crawled by, boring day by boring day. Christmas Day came and went, but it was uneventful for Dahlia. She was one of a handful of students that had remained at Hogwarts over Christmas, so other than the Christmas Day Feast there was little else going on.The headmaster called Dahlia to his office Christmas evening. Dahlia was surprised when she got his summons; it had been weeks since they had spoken, an unusually long time for the pair. Dahlia had figured that with the tournament and Harry's unexpected entry he must just be unconventionally busy, and had dismissed it. She eagerly trotted up the steps to his office, practically singing the password to the gargoyle that guarded his office.She barged into his study to find him seated behind his desk, deep in discussion with two Ministry Officials and Professor Moody, and Professor Snape."Ah, yes, Dahlia, if you wouldn't mind waiting outside for a moment? We won't be but another minute or two.""Of course; I'm sorry, headmaster I didn't mean to intrude." Dahlia respectfully backed out of the room, closing the door as she went. She seated herself in the chair next to the door, amusing herself with the scarce whispers that she could discern from inside the study."-threat inside the school." One is the ministry officials was speaking, his voice urgent.A few seconds of hushed whispering before she heard Professor Moody's voice. "-too late, now."Dahlia strained to hear the rest of the conversation but was unsuccessful. She slumped in her chair, content to wait until the meeting came to an end. Two minutes later Dumbledore came out to greet her, embracing her in a warm hug."Come in, my dear. They've all used the Floo Network to go attend to business. How was your Christmas?" Dumbledore took a seat, leaning forward eagerly. Dahlia glanced around his office to find all previous visitors gone.Dahlia smiled at her guardian, curious yet eager to catch up. "It was uneventful. I'm ready for classes to begin.""Ah, always studious aren't we?" The flint in his eye gleamed as he observed his ward. "As much as I wish we could chat, I called you here for a reason tonight.""Okay?" Dahlia looked at the headmaster questioningly. Albus seemed almost nervous; something extremely uncharacteristic for him. His hand were idly playing with the tip of his beard, a gesture most took for him to be thinking, but she knew better. More often than not, that particular tick meant nervousness."There is one matter, where I haven't always been truthful. However, what I knew was so... absurd that I wasn't even sure if it was true." Dumbledore paused, clearing his throat. "However, with recent events I believe it is time I shared what I know with you."Dahlia leaned back, eying the headmaster warily. "What is it?""The night we found you, we were put in a difficult place. I'm afraid this is where I must apologize, because I have lied." Dumbledore looked at his ward sadly. Dahlia straightened up in her chair, eyeing him suspiciously. "I do know more information that I have told you about your parents."Dahlia started upright in her chair, an accusing glare on her face. "What do you mean?"Albus hesitated, like he didn't want to confess what he was about to say. "Your mother, my dear, was Basilea Peverell, descendant of Ignotus Peverell."At Dahlia's confused look Dumbledore raised a hand. "Allow me to explain." He took a breath before beginning again. "A man worked for me during the rise of the Dark Lord. He was originally a Death Eater, but turned sides when someone he loved was threatened. He came to me to protect her - unfortunately she was ultimately found, and killed." Dumbledore looked at the stoic face on his ward, but continued on with his story. "This man came to me, desperate to get away. He was devastated; so I had compassion on him, and offered to send him on a mission for me. However, this mission wasn't any ordinary mission."Dumbledore paused, offering an object to Dahlia across the desk. Dahlia accepted it, turning it over in her fingers. It was a strange necklace, on a two foot gold chain. At the end of the chain was a trinket, larger and bulkier than most necklaces. Several dials and spinners twisted around the metal trinket, almost a perfect circle, but with the sketching of an eye on the lid. Ancient runes and symbols were carved into it, a strange magical hum vibrated from it, so faint it was almost undetectable."Do you know what this is?"Dahlia examined it closer, a theory formulating in her mind, "It looks like a strange time-turner."Dumbledore's face lit up in a mix of surprise and pride. "Precisely! This time turner is one of my own making, actually. It's unique in the way that while it can also reverse time," he leaned forward as though about to share a secret. "It can also go forwards."Dahlia gaped at him, looking sharply down at the object in her hand. She shook her head in denial, mind spinning. "That... that's supposed to be impossible. Magic like that defies multiple Time Laws... as well as the quantum theories behind it!"Dumbledore chuckled, smiling knowingly. "It's amazing what is impossible until it is done. Nonetheless, I continue. This time-turner is not without limits. You cannot turn time up past your current time; for example, if I were to take this time turner back ten years, I could spend a minute there and then return to exactly my time and place. Any normal time-turner, you -""Would be forced to live out the ten years until the time lines aligned," Dahlia finished for him knowingly. "I understand.""You always were bright," Dumbledore admired her, tears in his eyes. "I digress, I presented the man with this time-turner, and sent him on a mission nearly 50 years ago in the past, now."Dahlia gaped at the headmaster, but remained silent so Dumbledore continued. "He returned abruptly from his mission, bloody and clutching a crying baby." Dumbledore met Dahlia with tear-filled eyes. "You."Dahlia was at a loss for words. "You mean...?""Let's allow me to finish the story before we ask questions, okay?" Dumbledore interrupted her kindly. "We went up here, where the man told me about a woman he had met on his mission. This woman had appeared suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere. Coincidentally, this woman bore a striking resemblance to the woman the man had been in love with, so he helped her. Your mother died minutes after appearing, leaving the man with a baby. Not knowing what else to do, he returned here." Dumbledore paused to look at her affectionately. "We came to the conclusion that your mother was not from the timeline they were in, just as the man I had sent on a mission wasn't."Dahlia's gasping was barely audible as she stared wide-eyed at the professor in front of her, processing the broken up story he'd just told her. After several long moments, Dahlia found her voice, "You mean to say, my mother was from the future?"Dumbledore shook his head with a gentle laugh. "No, my dear. Your mother is from the past. She appeared wearing clothes designed from a medieval period. Approximately the 1000's."Dahlia gaped at him, her mind spinning. She wavered back and forth as she processed which questions to ask first, mind clearly overwhelmed. "Wh-..... How... Who is my father?" She seemed to finally settle on a question to ask, looking instantly at her guardian.Dumbledore hesitated, "Unfortunately, your mother did not speak of who your father could be before her death. I've been able to track Basilea Peverell through several genealogy books, and the most that is said about her is that she had two sons, but vanished suddenly during her third pregnancy. She was married to a man who had died years prior to your birth, so whoever your father was is not written in the history books."Dahlia staggered at the information, hands rubbing her temples. "You... so... I'm a Peverell? Didn't that family name die off or marry off hundreds of years ago?"Dumbledore nodded solemnly. "You are the only Peverell name bearing descendant to exist in many centuries. However, there are others who have the Peverell blood in their veins.""Wh-what?" Dahlia seemed as though in a daze. "What do you mean?""The Peverell name died out, but the blood, the magic, never did. It was transferred into other families; other names that have created legacies for themselves."Dahlia collapsed on the floor, knees giving out with shock. A Peverell. She was a Peverell. All the blood rushed out of her head and she collapsed on the floor of the study. Everything went fuzzy, her head was pounding like it was going to explode. She could vaguely hear Albus's voice calling her name, a cool cloth being touched to her fore head."Is that why you kept me locked up? Because I'm not from this time?" Dahlia rasped, clutching her guardian's arm as he helped her sit up, amber eyes piercing his demandingly.Dumbledore slowly nodded. "There are things in effect right now that you cannot interrupt; things that would impact the world for hundreds of generations."Dahlia's temper flared as she sagged against the desk, weak but still defiant. "What are you saying?""I'm saying you are different. Word has reached me that a new prophecy has woken in the Department of Mysteries." The headmaster studied his ward's face carefully, as if still deciding whether she should be told. Dahlia cocked a brow, suspicious."A prophecy?""Yes," Dumbledore spoke softly, crouching down on the floor next to her. "This one, I fear is about you."Dahlia's eyes flew open wide as she spun to face the headmaster. "About me? How?""I do not know," Albus said seriously. "I am trying to find out; and I will inform you when I know. However, you must promise me you will keep this information to yourself. Tell no one who you are, and where you came from. You are the last surviving true Peverell, and if word gets out there will be many questions that are unable to be answered."Dahlia nodded numbly, her head so full of thoughts and feelings she felt as if she would burst. She kept the thoughts to herself, waiting for her guardian to dismiss her."I heard you are becoming close friends with Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore said with a wink as he helped her to her feet, holding onto her shoulders until he was sure she'd regained her footing."I-... uh... yes, we're friends," Dahlia said awkwardly, shifting from one foot to another, testing her limbs awkwardly.. The sudden topic changed set her on edge, wondering what he had seen."I think it's about time someone showed him what love is." Dumbledore smiled knowingly at Dahlia before continuing. "I just warn you of the aftermath of trusting the wrong people."Dahlia squared her jaw, nodding her head jerkily. A warning. A reminder to keep her identity a secret. "Yes, sir." She understood his silent dismissal, and made her way to the door. She paused in the doorway, turning back to the headmaster one last time."Albus... the man who found me. Who was it?" The question was strange, she knew, but the air of mystery around him had her curious. She had to ask. Dumbledore regarded her with compassion and understanding as he folded his glasses on his desk, his mild shock apparent as he leveled with her. "This must remain confidential."Dahlia gave one jerky nod of her head. "Of course.""Severus Snape."She saw herself out.

The rest of Christmas break passed by in a blur as she began her procrastinated homework from break. As the days went by she slowly got more and more depressed. Dahlia had tried to push her conversation with her guardian from her mind, but it was all she could think of. She'd searched the Library for anything on the Peverell family, but not much was said in history books. Dahlia requested genealogy books from the Library Mistress, and was hoping to have her hands on them soon. Apparently such books were commonly kept at the surviving family's private libraries, so a request must be sent. Dahlia didn't know how long it would take for her to get her hands on them, but she was determined to search every book in the library for 'Peverell" anyways.When she wasn't obsessing over the genealogy, her mind was drifting to the handsome Slytherin boy. Not once did Draco owl her. Granted, he never had said he was going to but she had thought he would have at least sent a Merry Christmas.She had drafted about thirty different letters to him, all of which were abandoned in her package of parchment. Some were even sealed and addressed, ready to be delivered but she couldn't work up the nerve to send it.Instead she bided her time in the library, working on the huge load of assignments the students had been plagued with, and searching the books for her family record. Her research kept her busy, most nights she fell asleep in the library and didn't even make it up to Gryffindor Tower. Thankfully, with so few students still at the castle, her library sleepovers went unnoticed. Finally, January 10th arrived and Dahlia was on the front steps of the castle waiting for the carriages to arrive. She saw them trotting up the pathway, her feet skipping lightly down the steps towards the landing.She stood as the first one approached, and a beaming Ron jumped out. "Hey, Dahlia!" He embraced her as the rest of the students piled out of the carriage. Dahlia greeted the rest of the Weasley's and Hermione with smiles, all looking refreshed and happy to be back at Hogwarts. The girls were giddy to catch up after break, promising to meet up in the common room later.The Gryffindors were in front of her, heading up to the castle when she heard a familiar voice behind her."You haven't been eating," his voice sent shivers down her spine as she spun around to face him. Her heart skipped a beat; his brow was furrowed in concern as he looked her up and down."Hello to you too!" She exclaimed, bounding up to him. She cut herself just short of throwing her arms around his neck when she remembered they were in public. Instead, she grabbed his burlap sack while he dragged his trunk up the stairs. They didn't say a word, simply walked side by side in silence.As soon as his luggage was deposited in the corridor for Filch to distribute, Draco grabbed Dahlia's hand and pulled her down an abandoned hallway. She giggled as he sped up, searching for an empty room until he found one at the very end of the hallway. He opened the door and gestured for her to go through. He followed closely behind, locking the door behind him. No sooner had the door clicked closed behind him did Dahlia throw herself into his arms and bury her face in his neck. He was taken back by the force of her weight, tumbling backwards for a moment before regaining his balance.His arms wrapped around her instinctively, pulling her close to him. Draco relaxed the second she was in his arms, burying his nose into her hair, clinging to her as tightly as she clung to him.Christmas break had been strange at Malfoy Manor. His father had been unusually on edge, and his Aunt Bellatrix and Uncle Rudolphus seemed to have permanently moved in. Multiple times Draco had woken in the middle of the night to find his parents and their friends in meetings in the kitchen, whispering just low enough to avoid being heard. The gathering of old death eaters was never a good sign, and Draco had spent his holiday attempting to overhear the plans being made. He knew his father had supported Voldemort during his rise, just as his grandfather had before him. Draco was paralyzed at the thought of what would happen when he became of age to join the Dark Lord. He was too young now; the Dark Lord didn't use children, but his seventh year would come faster than he wanted. He wouldn't be able to refuse at seventeen - he wasn't so naive to think his family wouldn't be punished for his refusal.All of that left his mind as he buried his nose in her hair and inhaled her honey-lavender shampoo. His worries melted away for a second as he reveled in the moment, relieved to return to her. He quickly came back to when he glanced down and found her quietly crying into his shoulder."Dahlia," He murmured, drawing her close, his voice low with concern. He stroked her hair gently as her shoulders shook with silent cries. "What's wrong?""I missed you, you ass!" Dahlia exclaimed, angrily wiping her nose on her sleeve as she swatted at his chest harmlessly. For a moment her anger flashed in her eyes; she glared at Draco, but just as quickly as her temper came it, it left. She sunk back into his arms and muttered against his chest, hands entangled in his shirt. "You... you didn't even write."Draco couldn't decide whether to get down on his knees and beg her forgiveness or tell her she was adorable and kiss her tears away. He decided to do both, scooping her up so that he held her bridal style. She buried her face in his neck, and he shivered when he felt her inhale his scent.His throat tightened, gut wrenching at her words. Draco murmured into her ear as he stroked her hair. "I'm sorry I didn't write; something was happening at my house and it wasn't safe."Dahlia pulled away sharply, quickly scanning him as though for injuries. "What do you mean? Are you okay?"Draco nodded, bringing her hands to his lips and kissing them lightly. "I'm fine. I started about thirty letters to you, I just didn't want to risk sending them."Dahlia bit her lip against asking what had been so dangerous about sending a letter, but she remembered who his family was, and thought better of it. He seemed sincere in his regret; Dahlia found herself willing to overlook it as her face softened."I had a shitty break too," she confessed with a half smile. His gaze met hers, half amused, half sad."What happened to you?" He asked as he led her to a sofa in the back of the room, sinking into it and gesturing for Dahlia to do the same. She sat next to him, leaning back into his shoulder, his arm sliding around her possessively."I... nothing," Dahlia hesitated, Dumbledore's warning ringing in her ears. She winced, eyes glued to the wall, knowing he was going to push the subject. She heard him inhale, felt his chest rise and fall.Instead of pushing he simply cupped her face in his hands and looked into her eyes. His eyes roamed her face for a moment before he asked his question. "Are you okay?"Dahlia was taken back for a moment, but she nodded tearfully, hand gripping his wrist. "I'm okay.""Good," Draco nodded, leaning forward to rest his forehead against hers, thumb caressing her face. She leaned into his touch, eyes drifting clothes. "That's all I need to know."Dahlia lost track of how long they stayed there, side by side on the couch, her leaning against his shoulder. He had one arm around her protectively, while he leaned his cheek against the top of her head. It was comforting to sit in silence without needing to speak. His thumb drew soft circles on her shoulder, and she nuzzled further into his shoulder."Something's going to happen," Draco whispered, his hold on her loosening, gaze pinned to the wall. Dahlia glanced up at him, her brow furrowed in confusion."What do you mean?"Draco ran a frustrated hand through his hair, regretting his words. Fuck, ten minutes around her and he was already betraying his family. He shouldn't have said anything at all, and now that he had he didn't know which was worse: keep talking and betray his family, or not talk and she got caught in the crossfire. Draco ground his teeth, debating whether to say more. He decided to remain silent; all he knew for certain was that the Inner Circle had begun to gather. He hadn't been able to decipher any of the heavily guarded whispers from the meetings, even though he spent hours with his ear to a door or vent. If he ever found real, concrete evidence he would tell her, he rationalized with himself.Dahlia cleared her throat, prompting Malfoy. Realizing he still hadn't spoken, Malfoy's lips settled into a straight line. Part of him inside was screaming for him to tell her what had been happening, but he knew better than to betray his family's name. He had been raised better than that. "Nothing," he finally muttered, "just forget I said anything."Dahlia regarded him curiously, chewing at her lip as she debated whether or not to speak. "What was so dangerous about sending me a simple letter?"Malfoy flinched, pulling away from her as if her words poisoned him. He gave her an empty look. How could he explain to her that he didn't dare risk sending a letter with Death Eaters coming in and out of his house all day long? That a mere letter from him could make her a target? "I can't tell you."Dahlia could tell something was wrong, Malfoy's demeanor had changed. He was guarded, pulling away from her, arms crossed. Dahlia exhaled, laying a hand on his arm as she pushed him. "What happened?!""Why didn't you write, huh?" Malfoy snapped at her, his temper flaring. Dahlia jerked her hand away, jarred by his sudden change in tone. "You aren't the only one capable of writing a letter here!" His ears were slowly turning pink with anger as his face flushed. Damn you! Malfoy silently screamed. How had she managed to slip herself into every one of his thoughts. She invaded his dreams, occupied every waking moment. He couldn't think straight about her; she infuriated him, but could make him feel so... free.Draco pushed Dahlia away. He knew better than this. He was a Malfoy. Dahlia was beneath him. "I have to go," Draco abruptly said as he stalked towards the door.Dahlia watched him leave, not bothering to call after him.

That night Dahlia awoke in the Gryffindor common room, parchment stuck to her face. She groggily pushed herself upright, swinging her legs off of the armrest. She strained her neck, attempting to sort out the now cramped muscles."About time," a tired voice behind her spoke. Dahlia started, peaking over the edge of her chair. Her sleepy focus found Harry slouching in an armchair, looking disgruntled. He wore his quidditch sweat pants and a t-shirt that looked like it hadn't seen an iron in weeks."What are you doing up this late?" Dahlia rubbed the sleep from her eyes as she checked the time: 1:25am. She must have fallen asleep studying."Can't sleep." Harry muttered bitterly. She noticed him wince, his hand subconsciously drifting to his scar. Dahlia regarded him curiously for a moment, but he didn't speak again."Does it hurt?" Dahlia asked, gesturing to his forehead. She'd never asked him about his parents or his scar before, but in the sanctity of the abandoned common room Dahlia felt it was the best time she'd ever be offered.Harry tossed her a wary glance, her question obviously putting him on guard. He nodded anyways. "Sometimes, yeah."She looked at him closely, noticing the bags under his eyes for the first time. His Gryffindor sweatpants and t-shirt were rumpled like he hadn't bothered to fold them before throwing them in his drawer. His hair was poking at odd angles, giving him an almost crazy appearance as his glasses reflected the flames of the fire."Can you keep a secret?" Harry's voice surprised her. Dahlia's eyes widened, but she nodded. She was uncanny with secrets, considering the biggest ones she kept were her own. She turned around in her seat to fully look at him.Harry seemed to study her for a minute before leaning forward in his chair, placing his head in his hands. "I know what the third task of the tournament is." Harry spoke bitterly, his words having an edge she hadn't heard before. Dahlia found herself sitting up a little straighter, her eyebrows raised. He accepted her silent invitation to keep going."It's a maze," he whispered, glancing up briefly to meet her eyes as he spoke. "The trophy is hidden in the middle of the maze, and the champions race to retrieve it first."Dahlia felt the tightness in her chest relax a little bit. "Oh," she said, giving Harry a sideways glance, almost curiously. Certainly a maze was easier than the other two tasks. "That sounds easier than dragons."Harry's barked a sarcastic laugh. "Yeah, except the maze is filled with obstacles meant to stop the champions from reaching the trophy, in any way possible.""Obstacles?" The sinking feeling crept back into her chest."Dementors, bogarts, spells, werewolves, who knows what hell they'll come up with." Harry's voice spiked as he paced around the room. His fists opened and closed as though he couldn't figure out what to do with his hands when he was mad. Dahlia watched him, not speaking until her fellow Gryffindor had calmed down enough to sit back down. She started to open her mouth, when his gaze met hers and her voice went silent. His green eyes were tortured, desperate."Every time the maze has been used in the tournament a champion has died," Harry whispered. His green eyes latched onto Dahlia's amber ones."Oh, Harry," Dahlia exhaled, slumping back into her chair for a moment. A second later she stood up and positioned herself so she was kneeling next to Potter's chair. Dahlia gently placed her hand on his arm, noticing how he twitched away subconsciously. "You'll be fine," Dahlia encouraged softly, urging him to look at her. "Everything in that maze you've faced before and won."Harry attempted to smile, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. "That's not what I'm worried about."Dahlia stilled, brows furrowing, not understanding how a maze full of things trying to kill you wasn't what he was worried about."Because of the dangerous history of the maze the Ministry has set new regulations in place." Harry's voice was hoarse, his eyes avoiding hers as he spoke. "Each champion is required to have a second.""A second?" Dahlia's blank stare made it clear she had no idea what that was."Another witch or wizard that enters the maze if I'm injured or unable to continue."Dahlia absorbed his words for a moment before translating it. "You need a partner."Harry nodded. He worked his jaw a couple times before speaking, his voice as broken as she had ever heard it. "I won't choose, Dahlia." Harry shifted his eyes to meet hers. "I won't choose which one of my friends has to risk dying for me. Not again. Ron still dreams about the Acromantulas from Second year - Hermione got Petrified by the Basilisk! I can't -""Dahlia was silent for several moments. Her and Harry stayed frozen where they were as she considered his words. A small voice in her head prodded her, reminding her of her conversation with Albus Dumbledore. She wasn't supposed to be here; she wasn't in the right time, she couldn't intervene. But maybe she could do this one thing. This wasn't the war, this was a school tournament. An apparently deadly one, but it toed the line without crossing it."I'll do it," the words were out of her mouth before she even thought about it. Harry's head jerked up, a shocked expression on his face."I can't ask you to -""You didn't," Dahlia cut him off, leaning back to cross her arms, determination written on her face. "I offered. I'll do it. I'll be your second."Harry hesitated, still looking at her uncertainly. "Are you sure? This isn't some game; we will be fighting for our lives in that maze."Dahlia nodded firmly, her face set and determined. She maintained eye contact with her fellow Gryffindor as she spoke. She needed him to feel the conviction in her voice; to see the honesty in her eyes. "I'm positive. You need to protect Hermione and Ron; I get that."Harry instantly seemed to feel guilting about needing to protect them and not her; he started to speak. "Dahlia, it's not that -""Harry, stop." Dahlia hushed him, shaking her head adamantly. "Your need to protect them - I get it. I am not offended." A look of relief flashed across Harry's face, but Dahlia pushed on. "I think having one of them in the maze with you would hurt you, more than help you. The entire time in there you would refrain from calling them in because that would mean putting them in danger. You need a second that you aren't obligated to protect."Dahlia's words cut through Harry like a knife. Tears sprang into his eyes and he locked eyes with the dark haired girl in front of him. "Y-yes," Harry nodded, his guilt etched on his face.Dahlia gave him a few moments to collect himself as she stood. He stood up with her, his eyes slightly puffy. She met his eyes and extended her hand. "I would be honored to be your second, Harry." Her voice rang with sincerity.Harry seemed to weigh the truth in her words before nodding once, giving her hand a quick shake. She took that as him accepting her offer. As she collected her books to retire to her dormitory a few moments later, she heard Harry's voice drift behind her."Thank you."_It had been a week since the students had returned from the Christmas holidays. Dahlia's schedule was packed; any free period during the day she spent combing through the library. Her and Harry had gone on a hunt for information about the maze from previous tournaments. Although, Dahlia would admit they would accomplish their task much quicker if they asked Hermione for help. Harry refused to allow Hermione to be involved, so Dahlia was on her own.Dahlia made her way from the library towards the common room. Ever since her commitment to Harry to be his second she had felt this sense of impending doom hanging over her head. A chill never failed to shiver down her spine whenever she thought of the third task. Unable to shake the feeling, she had checked out every book that mentioned the triwizard tournament. If they had to enter the maze, Dahlia was determined to be prepared.Harry had asked her to keep it a secret that she was his second. When she had protested, arguing that Ron and Hermione deserved the truth Harry had firmly said no. So, Dahlia had agreed to keep it to herself for now, but she would be avoiding them until she didn't have to lie.Although her life quickly turned hectic, Dahlia was grateful for the distractions. Draco still hadn't attempted to talk to her after having walked away from her a few days previously. Dahlia wasn't surprised; he was nothing if not predictable. This time, however, Dahlia was done with his off-again-on-again games. She had to figure out a way to keep her and Harry alive in the maze, with only a few short weeks to prepare. Draco would offer nothing but distractions."Dahlia!"She turned around, searching for who called her. She spotted Harry right as he caught up to her, tugging on her arm. "Sorry!" He panted, steadying himself with her shoulder. Dahlia brushed him off with her excited chatter."I checked out every book in the library that references the tournament; hopefully there'll be something about what we can expect in the maze." Her Peverell name hunt had been placed on hold in light of new research that was needed for the tournament.Harry nodded, tugging on her arm again. He slowed her walk down so that they fell behind the flock of students making their way up the staircase. Dahlia sent him a questioning look, but didn't verbally question him as she allowed him to pull her to a complete stop."I had a nightmare about the maze; I woke up my scar hurting," Harry muttered lowly, scanning the hallways for signs of people who were listening, though it was mostly empty. Dahlia schooled her face to remain passive, though she cut Harry a wary look."I don't know what it means," Harry admitted. She caught the worried look in his eyes. A conversation she had had with Draco flashed through her head. The last one they had had, where he had whispered that something was going to happen. Of course, he'd promptly run away again afterwards, so she wasn't sure how reliable his information was.Respecting that the secrets they shared weren't for other ears, Dahlia kept her mouth shut about Draco. "Albus warned me," Dahlia admitted instead, gaze flickering up. Harry's eyes snapped to hers at the mention of the head master. Dahlia swallowed before continuing. "He warned me to be vigilant. Apparently things are happening here and he can't figure out why.""Blood hell, I forgot your Dumbledore's ward." Harry clapped a hand over his face, rubbing his eyes. "Is he okay with you being my second?""Haven't told him," Dahlia said with a shrug. She ignored Harry's shocked expression. "Honestly, he can't change my mind anyways. I'm doing it," she finished, eyeing Harry as though daring him to challenge her."You should tell him soon, then." Harry wouldn't admit he was relieved by her words, though she saw the hesitation on his face. He knew that she had been right by saying if he had to take Ron or Hermione as a second he wouldn't call them into the maze under any circumstances. He wouldn't allow it. "The champions are required to inform the Director of the Tournament of our seconds. They'll announce and swear you in at the Feast next month."Dahlia winced at their shortened timeline. "I was hoping to just show up the day of the maze and ride bench until you needed me." She threw a wink in at the end, hoping he knew she was teasing. Harry tossed his head back and laughed, resuming their walk to class.They continued in silence once their laughter subsided, Harry's face had shifted to a resigned, serious look as he glanced at the Gryffindor girl beside him. "I won't call you in there unless I'm desperate, you know." Harry held her gaze as he spoke."No," Dahlia rolled her eyes, shaking her head firmly, a scowl on her face. "You can't do that. If you want someone you feel the need to shelter, get Ron or Hermione to do it. A choice like that will wind up with you dead." Dahlia put her hand on his shoulder, forcing eye contact between them. "I was raised by Albus Dumbledore, Harry," Dahlia reminded him gently but sternly. "He remains the only wizard Voldemort ever feared. Don't you think I can handle myself?"Harry's doubts were beginning to slip away; her words were logical, her thinking sound. "Okay," he finally conceded. "I'll inform the Director today."Dahlia gave a nod and watched as her friend walked away. Her wondering eyes caught sight of a particular Slytherin, who was lounging against the corridor across from her. He was studying her intently, a sneer plastered on his face. Dahlia paled, wondering how much he'd heard, but gazing by his leering gaze, he'd been much too focused on what he thought he was seeing. Her and Harry together.Dahlia rolled her eyes, but met his gaze anyways. She held it for a moment, before forcing herself to turn and walk away, shaking her head in disappointment. She felt more than saw his anger at her retreat; Dahlia half expected him to follow, but if he did he never caught up to her.It's for the best, Dahlia told herself as she approached the portrait of the Fat Lady sullenly. You aren't even supposed to be born. Draco is best left alone.Dahlia shuddered as she tried to imagine Draco's reaction to finding out how she wasn't even supposed to be from this timeline. He would tell the whole school how she wasn't supposed to exist, just to draw a reaction from her. He'd disappear for weeks after finding out - that much was for sure. That seemed to be what he did best. She straightened her shoulders; it was time to admit something to herself.That's why I'm the perfect second, Dahlia thought bitterly. Who's more expendable than the person who probably isn't supposed to exist in the first place?_Two weeks flew by. Harry and Dahlia met almost every night that there wasn't quidditch to prepare for the upcoming third task. The first few gatherings had her and Harry pouring over books in the library as they searched for information on the maze, gleaning information on what the maze could be stocked with.What little information they did manage to find was vague. The only clear information Dahlia was able to find was a record book of all Triwizard competitors. Every TriWizard Cup competitor was recorded, along with their cause of death if they died during the tournament. The book is ghastly; she was probably the only person in the last century to check it out, but still. It was a gold mine. Dahlia and Harry clung to its every word."What the hell is a hidebehind?" Harry said, flipping through the record book. The Maze contained more than half of the book's deaths, some killed by indiscernible creatures. Dahlia had an ongoing list to research, or ask Hagrid.Dahlia didn't look up from her book, scribbling the name down on the parchment beside her. "No idea, why?""Cause this guy was decapitated by one," Harry flinched as he continued reading. "They never found his head."Dahlia spared the book he was holding a glance, seeming skeptical. "That sounds like a magical creature. I'm more worried about getting hexed or trapped in there than I am of a magical creature taking me out."Harry shrugged, though he seemed wary. "If Hogwarts has taught me anything, it's to never underestimate the magical creatures."Dahlia sent him a glance, confused and concerned. "What do you mean?""My first year we had a run in with the centaurs that live in the Forbidden Forest. Second year we almost got eaten by Acromantulas AND a basilisk in the same week. Third year," Harry suppressed a shiver, "was Animagi, werewolves, and dementors. Honestly, magical creatures have almost killed me more times than Voldemort."Dahlia tossed her head back and roared with laughter. She vowed to put more urgency to look up the magical creatures on the list beside her. "I like that you aren't afraid to speak his name."Harry shrugged, smile fading slightly. "Someone told me once: Fear of a name -""-increases fear of the thing itself." Dahlia finished, laughing at Harry's shocked face. She shot him a wink as she turned back to her book. "You forget he raised me."Harry grinned sheepishly as Dahlia turned her attention back to her book. It was silent for a time until her voice broke the quiet. "There're 25 cases of dementors in the maze.""I can conjure a Patronus," Harry immediately offered, seeming unbothered by her statement."Really?" That got Dahlia's attention. She closed the book she had been reading, looking up eagerly at him. "Could you teach me?""Yeah," Harry agreed slowly, "It's not easy though...""Yeah, well, if we get separated in the maze I need to be able to do one too," Dahlia reasoned, mind conjuring a plan. "Can we find a room with space to practice spell work next time?""Sure, I'll keep an eye out for one," Harry agreed as he packed his books into his bag, signaling their research session was at an end. Dahlia swept her books into her bag with a flick of her wand, mocking Harry's muggle methods. Harry stuck his tongue out at her, but she just laughed."The Feast's next weekend," Harry said as they exited their study room, checking the hallway for prefects. The clock on the Astronomy tower was striking midnight, well past curfew."I'm aware," Dahlia said simply as the two began their dash to the passageway that would lead them to their common room."Last chance to back out," Potter tempted, his voice teasing but his eyes were serious.Dahlia rolled her eyes, giving him a light shove. "Get out of here, Potter. You're not getting rid of me."Draco was prowling the castle corridors. Midnight had come and gone hours ago, but Malfoy couldn't sleep. He paced the corridors of the dungeon as he made his way towards the ground floors of the castle. It was in the early hours of the morning; most prefects have abandoned their routes by now in light of breakfast starting soon. The corridors were ghostly empty, the torches on the wall flickering and casting eerie shadows. Malfoy growled at Mrs. Norris who was peering around a corner. The cat hissed at him before dashing back behind the corner."Too bad that cat didn't stay petrified," Draco mumbled to himself as he continued his walk around the castle, no particular destination in mind.The feast of Champions was set for two days away from now. The director of the tournament would reveal the nature of the task, and then a month later the final task would be held. The details of the third task were heavily secreted - rumor was only the champions knew, but they were forbidden from speaking on it. That elicited many colorful rumors to run rampage through the castle.Something was going on, Draco was sure of it. There was more than just the secrets going on; His mother had insisted he join them at their family manor this past weekend. She had never called him home during the school year to spend a weekend at home - save for his uncles death. Draco had agreed to return to the Manor only because he needed an escape from Hogwarts and Dahlia Dumbledore. He'd steeled his resolve and was maintaining a diligent distance from her, but that didn't stop him from seeing her everywhere. In the halls, the corridors, classes, lunch, dinner, she was everywhere he turned and it was infuriating. Her interaction with Potter in the corridor that he'd witnessed only spurred his suspicions that something was going on. He thought his visit back to Malfoy Manor might give him some reprieve - possibly even insight - but his visit back home had been stressful. Draco knew as soon as he stepped foot back home that the Inner Circle had something planned.It was as though the Death Eaters had demanded a family reunion. Blaise and Theo had been at his Manor that weekend as well, dressed to the nines, answering to their mother's every beck and call. Of course, they weren't permitted to enter the meetings, but they were still witness to the re-formation of the Death Eaters. He hadn't been able to get anything concrete on what was happening until his final night at the Manor. He had overheard a conversation between his Aunt Bellatrix and his father that had"-we will place it in the maze," Lucius had hissed forcefully. Draco had been in the wine cellar stealing firewhiskey for him, Theo, and Blaise. He hadn't known his father and Bellatrix would storm down there arguing."And risk someone else taking it?!" Bellatrix's infuriated shriek made eavesdropping easy. Draco sank back behind a barrel, praying he remained unnoticed."We must get the boy there.""Surely there is another way," Bellatrix snapped. "One with a lower chance of failing.""No," Lucius had snapped back, his voice taking a bored tone. "It will work. Once Potter enters the maze he won't walk out."Bellatrix had still seemed doubtful as she continued to question Malfoy Sr.. "And what about his second? You did hear about the Ministry's new regulations? "Lucius Malfoy had apparently dismissed the thought, and that's where the conversation had ended. Bellatrix snatched a bottle, and stormed back up the cellar stairs, criticizing Mafoy Sr. the entire way. Draco was left behind, processing the conversation he'd overheard. He was no fool; if Potter was with his second when he found whatever object they were placing in the maze, they would kill his second without a moment's thought.Draco squeezed his eyes shut, trying to pull himself back from the memory. Draco knew he wasn't intended to hear that conversation. He would be killed - or worse - if he tried to repeat what he had heard. He recalled Dahlia's interaction with Potter, the way they were urgently whispering to each other. A sickening feeling churned in his stomach; internally a battle raged within him. His family would never accept him if he betrayed their trust. However, knowing the plot of Potter's murder - and the murder of his second - was costing the Slytherin boy sleep.Rather than speaking of it, Draco wandered the castle arguing with himself. Deep down Draco knew that Potter was ultimately the best chance of one day defeating the Dark Lord, but he still found himself hesitating telling him what he had overheard.Draco was walking down an unfamiliar wing of the castle when he discovered a door that was locked. Locked doors were rare in Hogwarts; usually doors were left open if unattended. As he passed by the door, curiosity got the better of himself. He reached out, trying the handle only to find it wouldn't budge. He knelt down, listening for voices. He heard two familiar voices, but was unable to pinpoint exactly who they were.Draco pulled his wand from inside his robe, pointing it at the lock. "Alohomora," he whispered. The lock clicked open, and Draco swung the door open wide."Expelliarmus!" A flash of red light flew by his ear, hitting the stone edge of the door frame.Malfoy jumped back with a yelp as he flung his wand out. "Protego!"A huge transparent shield erupted in front of him, giving him time to take in the situation. Draco glanced around the room, taking in the scene before him. Dahlia stood in the center of the room, her hair flying wildly around her face in unruly waves. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes wide and bright. Her chest was heaving like she was out of breath, wand held out in front of her threateningly."Malfoy!" Dahlia gasped, realizing it was him who had barged in. She lowered her wand immediately, demanding, "What are you doing here?"With a slash of his wand the shield between them disappeared and Malfoy stepped forward, scowling. "I could ask you the same thing, Dumbledore."Dahlia's face turned cold at the use of her surname. She pinned him with a dead glare, wand hand twitching."What do you want, Malfoy? We're kind of busy here." A male's voice spoke from the right.Draco whirled around to find Potter glaring at him from the back corner of the room. Draco's eyes shifted back and forth between Harry and Dahlia, questioning, susupiciously. His face contorted into a snarl as he let out a sarcastic laugh, his mind turning dark. "The Chosen One and Dumbledore's Daughter. Should have known. The headmaster's two favorites had to end up together at some point, right?"A flush tinged Dahlia's cheeks, and she glared at Draco. Her mouth opened, most likely to put him in his place when Harry spoke up."If I didn't know any better, Malfoy, I'd say you were jealous," Harry said with a smirk, striding forward to stand beside Dahlia. Malfoy glared daggers at his enemy, grey eyes flashing angrily."I'm not jealous!" Draco barked at Harry, his hands clenched into fists, wand hand twitching."Good!" Dahlia snapped at him, crossing her arms over her chest. Malfoy opened his mouth to snap back at her, but she turned her back to him. "I'm too tired for your games tonight, Malfoy." Her voice was deadly calm, so cold that he almost didn't recognize it."What do you mean?" Malfoy snarled as he took a step towards her, Potter completely forgotten.Dahlia remained where she was, her back to him but he saw her shoulders tense. "I can't stand you pulling me close like you can't live without me, and then pushing me away and not speaking for the next three weeks." Dahlia's voice was detached, completely void of emotion. "I have too much going on without adding your games to my list."Malfoy felt her words like a punch in the gut. He stared at her back in shock - that hadn't been what he meant to do. He was dangerous for her, and she didn't know it; how could he explain that to her? He took three large strides until he stood directly behind her. Silently he willed her to turn around and face him, but she didn't. "What happened?" Draco asked desperately, needing to understand where this was suddenly coming from.Her only response was radio silence."Dahlia," Malfoy heard the desperation in his voice, but couldn't bring himself to care. He was vulnerable; she might as well know it. He couldn't take it anymore, reaching out to spin her to face him. Did she truly mean it?He was shocked to find her cheeks wet with tears when she slowly lifted her face to his. "Dahlia..." Draco cupped her face gently, trying to soothe her. "What's happened?"For a fraction of a second her face softened, and Draco caught a flash of hope flicker in her eyes. Then it extinguished, and she pushed him away."Don't do that," she muttered as she put distance between their bodies, shaking her head firmly at him. "Don't comfort me when you'll only push me away later."Malfoy felt his heart crash and somewhere around his gut. "Fine," he growled out, shoving his hands in his pants pockets. He kept his face unreadable, but internally he didn't know whether he hated her, or wanted to clutch her to his chest and never let go. "I won't touch you, but at least tell me what happened, Dahlia.""Nothing!" Dahlia snapped at him, desperately pushing stray hairs out of her face. "I just have enough going on without you making me feel like shit!"Malfoy felt as though she had struck him across the face. He knew it was his fault that hadn't spoken since the first day back from holiday. He had thought that space between them would make it easier; but it was the opposite. He knew that now. Mentally Draco beat himself up. He knew it was his fault; he'd hurt her. He'd walked away too many times already, and now she didn't believe that he wanted to stay."Dahlia, what happened?" He couldn't walk away not knowing what was wrong. He couldn't leave her here distraught and with Potter nonetheless."How about none of your damn business!" Dahlia turned, her voice rising to a shriek. "How about if you wanted to be there for me you should have been here a month ago!"Malfoy physically winced, his stormy grey eyes filled with tears. For several seconds neither of them made a sound. Then Draco turned on his heel, and stormed from the room."Don't you DARE walk away from me again, Draco Malfoy!" Dahlia screamed after him, but he didn't even look back. This was a mistake; she was a mistake. He kept walking until he was in the dungeons, throwing himself onto his bed in his dorm room. Dahlia Dumbledore was off limits, and it was about time he got that through his head. His little infatuation with the headmaster's ward needed to come to a close.Dahlia felt her legs collapse underneath her, and she sunk to the ground. The tears that had been threatening to overflow finally free-fell down her cheeks."Wow," Harry whistled as he stepped out from his corner of the room where he had retreated. "That was intense."Dahlia's head snapped up at the sound of Harry's voice. "Oh my god, Harry." Dahlia had completely forgotten he was there. She quickly wiped evidence of tears from her cheeks. "I'm so sorry; I forgot you were here.""Don't worry about it," Harry said kindly as he sat down next to her on the floor. He slid an arm around her shoulders, and Dahlia leaned her head against his shoulder. They sat there in silence for several minutes until Dahlia's sniffing slowed."What was that all about, anyways?"Dahlia shrugged, avoiding her friend's eyes. "I guess that's the end of whatever we were."Harry tried to mask his emotions, but Dahlia was already studying his face so he opted for honestly. "I'm not going to say I'm surprised, because you and Malfoy were something I had a small suspicion about since the hex thing," Dahlia blushed, avoiding his eyes. Harry forced her to look at him as he continued, choosing his words carefully. "I've known Malfoy a long time, and I don't think anyone has ever seen him care about anyone else." Harry paused, letting his words sink in before finishing. "He might just not have been taught how."Dahlia groaned, dropping her face in his hands. "I don't know what to do."Harry shrugged, withdrawing his arm from around her shoulders. "I can't tell you what to do; but I can tell you this: only someone he cared for would draw that kind of reaction from him."Dahlia nodded, and Harry seemed to get the hint that she was done speaking on it. He shuffled over to their tables and began packing up their books and charts. Since the Feast was in two days they agreed to reconvene their training after the celebration, and then parted ways.

The day of the feast dawned, and Dahlia woke early. She scurried down to the common room, surprised to see Harry already down there. She quickly scanned the room, ensuring they were alone before speaking. "When do I meet you for the Feast?""Champions and their seconds are being seated separately; Professor McGonagall will be coming to get you around 4:30. I guess just wait in the common room for her."Dahlia nodded before returning to her dormitory. Thankfully it was a Friday so everyone had classes. She had been excused from her two afternoon classes so she could prepare for the feast. While it wasn't anywhere near as upscale as the Yule Ball had been, as a champion's second Dahlia had been instructed to dress up.Her classes couldn't fly by quick enough. The moment transfiguration let out Dahlia made a beeline for her dormitory. Since the third event was a secret from everyone except the champions at this point her dorm was empty. She made good use of the empty dorm, competing her look with twenty minutes to spare.She had chosen a simple, floor length, blood red gown. It was much more classy than her Yule Ball attire. The dress was fitted across her bodice and waist, flowing loosely from her hips down. Her hair was pulled up in a half bun, with tiny braids accentuating it. A gold ruby hung from her neck, with a simple gold band around her wrist. Her make-up was natural, the boldest part being her winged eyeliner. Dahlia whirled around in front of her mirror a few times before descending the stairs to the common room.She was surprised to find Professor McGonagall sitting in an armchair waiting on her. The elder witch looked Dahlia head to toe twice before a rare smile tugged at her lips. "You look lovely, Miss Dumbledore."Dahlia blushed, her eyes lowering modestly. "Thank you, professor.""Are you ready?" McGonagall's sentimental streak was gone, replaced by her usually down-to-business tone."Yes," Dahlia said as McGonagall stood, and the Gryffindor girl followed her from the room and through the corridors. It was as though the Professor knew exactly which hallways to take to avoid people; they passed not one living soul on their way down to the Dining Hall.Professor McGonagall left Dahlia waiting in a small storage closet off of the Dining Hall. "Wait here," she instructed her student sternly. "Once all of the seconds have arrived you will be escorted out."Dahlia had no chance to reply before the Gryffindor Head had closed the door, leaving her alone. Several long slow minutes ticked by as Dahlia waited in the closet, lights flickering eerily. She was starting to believe that she had been forgotten when the door was opened, and Hermione Granger stumbled in.Dahlia gaped at her, her eyes wide as she stared at Hermione. "What are you doing here?!" She reached out to grab her friend's arm as though needing to verify she was real. Dahlia's mind spun as she looked her friend up and down. Hermione was in a simple strapless black gown that accentuated her body nicely, makeup attentively done. Her hair was braided down her back, giving her an almost regal appearance.Hermione steadied herself with Dahlia's hand before exclaiming. "You shouldn't be here!"Dahlia stared at her friend, her jaw wide open. "What the hell do you mean? I'm Harry's second!"Hermione's wide eyes grew wider as she slapped a hand over her mouth. "Oh, no.""Hermione..." Dahlia growled, giving her a shake, a sickening feeling of dread surfacing. "Start talking.""V-victor approached me last week. He told me about the third task, and how they were required to have seconds. He said he didn't trust anyone from Durmstrang; they would settle at nothing to have the glory for themselves." Hermione hesitated, but continued when Dahlia's grip on her arms tightened. "He asked me to be his second, and I agreed."Dahlia groaned, releasing Hermione's arm and walking to the other side of the small closet. She kicked a bucket that was on the ground and it clattered against the wall.Hermione watched her silently, wincing as the bucket clattered to the ground. "You mean Harry picked you as his second?" She sounded almost insulted.Dahlia seethed, spinning around to face Hermione. Harry was going to lose his shit. "No, Hermione, he didn't! He came to me, told me about the third task and how he was going to have to choose a second. And then he told me how he couldn't choose you or Ron because he knew putting you guys in this situation could mean you guys dying!" Dahlia's voice had risen to a scream. "I offered to be his second," she hissed, glaring at Hermione. "I offered to be his second because he's already lost enough, and he wanted to keep you safe."Hermione's eyes had filled up with tears while Dahlia yelled, and at her last words they fell down her cheeks. "I-I... oh Harry."Dahlia exhaled and threw herself dejectedly on the ground next to Hermione. Silence stretched between them before Dahlia snorted. "Well, at the very least it's you, and not Ron. He'd die for sure."Surprisingly, Hermione giggled, glancing over at her friend. Dahlia was already looking at Hermione, merriment in her eyes. The girls burst into laughter, and were still laughing when two more students entered the closet."Um, hello?" A french boy, probably a year or two older than then stepped in. "Is this for the seconds?"Dahlia and Hermione wiped tears from their eyes as they nodded, greeting the french wizard warmly."You must be Fleur's second?" Dahlia pushed herself to her feet, extending a hand to the boy.His brown eyes lit up in recognition as he shook her hand enthusiastically. "Ah, yes! You were Fleur's date!"Dahlia laughed in delight at being recognized, "Yes!""It is a pleasure! I am John." John moved on to shake Hermione's hand, and offer assistance off of the ground. Dahlia turned her attention to the fourth member of their group, and was surprised to find herself looking at the Hufflepuff boy who had tried to dance with her at the Ball. He pointedly ignored her gaze, so she chose to do the same. Deduction required that he be Cedric's second.Moments later Professor McGonagall came to fetch them, and led them the back way to the main doors of the Dining Hall. As she led them she gave them instructions, to which all of them clung to."You will be escorted in one at a time into the hall by your champion. The headmaster has a few words to say, and then they will swear the seconds in. Once that is complete all of you - champions and seconds - will take your seats and the Feast will start. Does anybody have any questions?" Professor McGonagall came to a halt in front of the Dining Room, looking sternly over the group of studentsDahlia spoke up. "Yes, Professor... Um... where are the champions?" She needed to tell Harry about Hermione before he saw it as they all walked down the aisle.McGonagall frowned at her. "They are already lined up and waiting just inside the doors. Alright now, everyone in order." She withdrew a list from her cloak pocket and began reading names."First, Cedric Diggory's second, Mr. Higgleton."Dahlia almost snorted at his last name, but managed to turn it into a small cough. McGonagall squinted her eyes at her for a moment before continuing."Next, Fleur Delacour's second, Mr. Rouge." John took his designated spot behind the Hufflepuff boy, giving her an eyebrow wiggle as he did so. Dahlia hid her snicker behind her hand as McGonagall continued."Third, Victor Krum's second, Ms. Granger." Professor McGonagall pursed her lips as though displeased her best student had been nominated for possible death. She said nothing else as she continued, Hermione stepping into her place in line."Finally, Harry Potter's second, Ms. Dumbledore." Another frown, this one with a flash of anger. Professor McGonagall glanced around to ensure the other students weren't listening before leaning in to Hermione and Dahlia. "I am not pleased to see my two finest students - not to mention Potter - on the short list for death."Dahlia didn't know whether to laugh, or take offense. Before she could decide, Mcgonagall continued. "However," The professor nailed them with a steely gaze. "I will be a great deal less pleased if you die." Another pause. She leaned even closer to the students, speaking so low the girls almost didn't catch her words. "You do not want to see me unhappy. Do what you must to ensure you come out alive."With that the Professor turned and strode away. She stopped just before exiting the corridor to add, "That includes Potter!" Before disappearing around the corner.Dahlia and Hermione remained where they stood, frozen to the spot. "Did she just...""I have no idea," Hermione breathed, still in shock."I think that was a compliment, wrapped in an insult, covered in a death threat."Before Hermione could respond the doors to the Dining Hall swung open, and the ceremony had begun.Everyone was gathered in the Dining Hall for the Feast of Champions. Malfoy was sitting at the Slytherin table between Zabini and Goyle, fugitively glancing around the room. His eyes had traveled the Gryffindor table up and down twice, but there was no sign of her. Malfoy dragged his gaze away from their table with a growl, silently cursing the magic tables for not providing the food yet."Damn, Malfoy, what's got you in a mood?" Zabini's bored voice drawled."Nothing," Malfoy snarled back at him, giving his friend a look that told him to back off. Blaise raised his eyebrows at him, but made no comment.Malfoy resisted the urge to scan the Gryffindor table again. Potter wasn't there, but that was expected. A brief scan of the Hufflepuff table confirmed Diggory wasn't there, which meant the champions had been gathered beforehand.Malfoy rolled his eyes. That meant there was going to be a bloody entrance where everyone could fawn over the competitors. The thought made him nearly gag on his food. Malfoy simply wished it would be over, so he could return to brooding in the privacy of his dorm.Minutes ticked by and there was still no sign of Dahlia. The Dining Hall was full, almost every seat occupied at the tables. Students from all schools were chattering exxcitedly, gossiping about the possibilities of the third task. Malfoy shifted uneasily in his seat. The Feast had been required for all students to attend, which meant there was no way Dahlia could avoid going.A small nagging voice in his head taunted that she might be in the hospital wing, which sent all kinds of images into his head, each worse than the last. He dismissed the thought after a couple seconds. Gossip spreads like wildfire around Hogwarts; if something had happened to her he would have heard.His thoughts were interrupted by the scraping of chairs as the headmaster rose to his feet, his arms outstretched in welcome. "Greetings, students! And welcome to the Feast of Champions!"The Dining Hall was filled with whistles and cheers that took several minutes to die down. Durmstrang students stomped their boots, while Hogwarts chants could be heard from all four tables. Dumbledore silenced all the noise with a single look, demanding everyone's attention."Before we begin the Ceremony, it is time to reveal the nature of the third task! In the Forbidden Forest, a clearing has been made where for several months our dear Professors Sprout and Hagrid have grown an incredible maze!"The great hall oohed, hanging onto Dumbledore's every word. Malfoy rolled his eyes, once again scanning the room for Dahlia. Screw the maze; where the hell was she? He scanned the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables, on the off chance she was seated there instead."However, it is no ordinary maze! At the center of the maze lies the TriWizard Trophy. The first champion to reach the center and obtain the trophy wins!" Dumbledore smiled at the excited chatter beneath him. He raised his hands, and slowly the chatter died down until he once again held the hall's attention. "This task is not to be taken lightly. So far our champions have faced dragons, and the dangers of the Black Lake. The maze is more dangerous than all of them."Dumbledore paused to look a few students in the eyes. "Over the last few months the Maze has been enchanted, and stocked with obstacles of all kinds. The maze is a tradition of the tournament; but it is dangerous nonetheless. Every year the Maze has been given as a task, a champion has died."The weight of his words settled over the hall, no one daring to speak. He had the student's attention now; gossip would change to who would be the student to die this year. Who of the four entering would die?Dumbledore continued, speaking but Malfoy only half heard him. His mind was spinning, remembering the conversation he had overheard at his manor. The death eaters were planning on planting something in that maze. Suddenly everything clicked into place; the conversations, the plan to murder Potter. Malfoy sat upright, looking around wildly. His parents were planning to murder Harry and make it look like an accident of the tournament in the name of the Dark Lord. One person died every time the maze was used, and the Death Eaters were going to ensure it was Potter.Dumbledore's voice brought him back to reality. "- due to the extended peril, and chance of death this year the Ministry has deemed this task unsafe to perform alone. Therefore, each champion has been asked to choose a second. The champion is required to complete the first ten minutes of the maze on his own. After which are up, the champion may choose if or when to bring in his second in to assist him."Shouts went up from the crowd from students wanting a shot at being a second. The Durstrang students seemed most eager. Malfoy's body went tense, a bad feeling building in his gut. Dumbledore silenced the students once again as he continued. "The champions have already chosen their seconds. I'm sorry to those of you who were not chosen! However, without further ado, I move to begin the ceremony!"The headmaster clapped his hands, trumpets sounded and the Dining Hall doors swung open, their trumpeting blanketing the shouts of complaints from the students."Announcing the Hogwarts champion Mr. Cedric Diggory, and his second Mr. Charles Higgleton."Draco all but ignored the Hufflepuffs as they strutted proudly up to the teacher's table, waving at their cheering table as they went. A pit had started to form in his stomach as he realized he might have discovered why Dahlia wasn't at her table."Announcing the Beauxbatons champion, Ms. Fleur Delacoure," Draco felt his chest tighten. Dahlia had accompanied Fleur to the ball, would she have gone so far as to be her second? His heart pounded painfully as the next second dragged slowly by. "And her second, Mr. John Rouge!"Draco felt like a weight had been lifted off of his chest. Dahlia hadn't been so stupid, thank god. He watched as the Beauxbatons couple paraded down the aisle, taking small bows and blowing kisses to their classmates."Announcing the Durmstrang champion, Mr. Victor Krum! And his second, Ms. Hermione Granger!" The entire hall erupted in cheers for the international quidditch player. He strutted proudly through the Great Hall, Hermione walking proudly on his arm.Malfoy, however, wasn't interested in watching the champions walk down the aisle. He needed to find Dahlia before she did something that got her killed. As he desperately scanned the Great Hall he noticed the faltering look on Potter's face when Dumbledore announced the Granger girl.Malfoy knew that was bad news. If anyone was to be Potter's second, it would have been Granger. If Granger had already been taken, then who had he chosen to settle with? Malfoy's eyes whipped to the Gryffindor table, his lip curling in a sneer when his eyes landed on the Weasley boy Potter was so fond of. So he hadn't chosen his best friend."Announcing the Hogwarts champion, Harry Potter! And his second-," Dumbledore faltered; it was only for a millisecond and if Draco hadn't been clinging to the headmaster's every word he would have missed it. That falter was all Draco needed, and his body froze.No, don't say it, don't say it, Draco silently pleaded with Dumbledore."-Dahlia Dumbledore!"The hall filled with cheers as Harry escorted Dahlia down the aisle. She looked fetching in her house colors, hair curled perfectly as it fell down her back. Malfoy couldn't move; his eyes were glued to Dahlia's face. She hadn't spotted him yet, her gaze fixed ahead on the stage. She had a smile plastered on, but he could tell it was fake. Dahlia appeared to be having a brief, heated talk with Potter as they walked down the aisle. Malfoy felt his mind telling him to move; to get to her and take her far from here. He started to push himself upright, intent on doing just that when Blaise's arm settling on his elbow, jerking him back down into his seat.Malfoy turned his attention to Dumbledore, hoping the headmaster would step in and save his ward, but Dumbledore simply stood before the champions, no worry in his gaze."Now that champions and their seconds have been presented, it is time to swear the seconds in."Malfoy saw red. He watched, unable to form a word or move a muscle as Dahlia turned to face Potter. Her face was set in a grim, determined look as her and Potter locked eyes. Draco felt like the wind was being knocked out of him; she was signing up to die, and she had no idea.And it was all his fault, because he had been too much of a coward to tell her.Time slowed as Draco focused on her face, willing her to look at him. He silently screamed at her, begging her to look at him just for one second, but she never took her gaze off Harry. He didn't realize how much time had passed until Dumbledore's voice brought him back."And now, the last champion second to swear in," the headmaster came to a stop before his ward, and Potter. Malfoy sucked in a breath, terrified of what was going to happen next. It felt like he had just been hit in the chest, like the very oxygen as being stolen from his lungs. Malfoy's ragged breaths were shallow as his eyes remained glued to the sight before him.He watched as Dahlia withdrew her wand, pointed it at her right palm and murmured a spell. A second later a slim trail of blood trickled down her hand. She turned to face Potter, who had done the same. They grasped hands, and Draco strained to hear Dahlia's voice."I, Dahlia Ariana Dumbledore, swear myself to you, Harry James Potter, as your second. On my magic, I will defend and support you in your endeavors; we accept this burden together; should you fail, I will succeed."A twittering erupted in the Dining Hall, students turning to murmur to their classmates next to them."What?" Malfoy fisted Blaise's robe beside him. His anger was apparent, his face scrunched, chest heaving as he twisted Zabini's robes, snarling, "What is everyone whispering about?"Blaise shifted closer to mutter into Draco's ear, brushing his hands from his shirt. "Dahlia's vow was different. The other seconds swore themselves and ended with "we accept this task together; should you require, I will step in.""What did Dahlia say?" Malfoy growled back, not understanding why everyone was whispering about this, scrambling for what words she had used. "Why does it matter?"Blaise turned to stare at him in wonderment. "Mate, magical oaths are very specific. She vowed to succeed should he fail."Draco dropped his head into his hands with a moan. Dahlia continued to bury herself in a mess she knew nothing about. What had she done? How had she made matters worse?Apparently the ceremony wasn't over; Potter's voice rang out over the Hall. Malfoy snapped his attention back to the pair as he spoke."I, Harry James Potter, accept you, Dahlia Ariana Dumbledore, to be my second. I hold you to your vow, and promise my own loyalty and life in return." Harry seemed to grip Dahlia's hand tighter as he finished his promise. There was a soft glow around their conjoined hands, so faint that Malfoy was almost convinced he didn't see it until he saw the sharp look on Dumbledore's face.Draco was shocked when the next moment the headmaster's gaze met his, and the two shared a pained look before Malfoy jerked his eyes away. He stood, excusing himself from the Slytherin table, and walked briskly out of the Dining Hall. Nausea rolled through his gut, and he detoured to the nearest bathroom.What had she done!?

Dahlia winced at the pain in her arm as Harry clenched it. They were standing at the back of the Great Hall while the other champions were announced. "Did he just say Hermione?" Her champion's body had gone rigid, his nails digging into her arm as he craned his neck in an attempt to see for himself."Harry, she's Krum's second," Dahlia mentally prepared herself for the explosion she knew would come, but before Harry could react their names were called."Announcing Hogwarts champions, Mr. Harry Potter!" Harry numbly released her arm, allowing her to take his elbow as he strode forward. "And his second, Dahlia Dumbledore!""The whole point of this was to keep them safe," Harry muttered to his second as they marched down the insanely long aisle to the teachers table amidst the cheers of their peers."I know." Dahlia tried to maintain the false smile on her face as she waved to a group of first years beaming at them."Krum won't protect her," Harry spat, glaring at the back of the quidditch player's head down the aisle. Dahlia squeezed his arm in warning, reminding him they were in front of the entire school.Dahlia remained silent for a moment, debating whether to tell him the truth. She took a deep breath, deciding that the truth might be the only thing that calms him down. "Harry, I caught them snogging in the library a week before the first event." Harry's eyes flew open as his head whipped around to hers. "He cares for her; and honestly, I think she can take care of herself."They were almost to the end of the aisle when Harry switched his grip to grasp her hand. She clung to his hand reassuringly."I can't do this with her in there," Harry mumbled, low enough for only her to hear.Dahlia gripped his hand back, but couldn't think of what to say. She knew Harry had been desperate to keep Hermione and Ron out of this, and now it was worse because Hermione was in it, and Harry couldn't protect her.Her mind was scrambling to come up with any possible way to fix this, but all she could do was grip Harry's hand. It was too late to go back.Dahlia focused on Harry's face as the ceremony proceeded. She barely heard the vows of the other three champions. The seconds had been schooled on what to say. Keep it simple, swear yourself to the champion for the task, end it saying how you would step in if needed. It was honestly quite simple; magic was funny like that. It was usually the most complex magic that followed the simplest of guidelines.The headmaster came to a stop before them, and Dahlia had to resist the urge to look into her guardian's eye. She had refrained from telling him she was Harry's second, fearing rebuke. Dahlia knew he wouldn't approve because it would fall under interfering, but what's done is done, so she kept her focus on Harry. There wasn't anyway Albus could tell her she couldn't do this now, not with the entire school watching.Dahlia withdrew her wand, using it to slice open the palm of her hand. Harry gripped her hand in his and locked eyes with her as she made her vow. Dahlia held her fellow Gryffindor's gaze as she spoke, hoping he recognized the meaning behind her vow. His eyes widened, and his grip tightened, and then he released her hand.Dumbledore healed their hands with a wave of his wand, and turned to address the student body below them. "And now! Let the Feast begin!"The previously empty tables were now heaping with food that had appeared at the Headmaster's words. Dahlia followed Harry up to the Champion's table beside the faculty's table. As she walked she tried to inconspicuously scan the Dining Hall, her eyes deceiving her by hoping to catch a glimpse of a particular Slytherin boy.All throughout the feast she was distracted, coming to the conclusion about halfway through that Malfoy was not present. The thought plagued her, though she couldn't pinpoint why. She tried to mask her scowl, but knew Harry caught it regardless. Thankfully, Harry was doing some sulking of his own, and didn't press her for details.Rather than talking the two of them ate in stoney silence, Dahlia searching for a sign of Malfoy, Harry glancing glumly at Hermione.Finally, the Feast came to an end and the second Dumbledore dismissed the students Harry stood, practically running for the door.Hermione and Dahlia exchanged glances before wordlessly shoving their chairs back and following. Hermione paused to wish Krum goodnight on her way out, before trotting to catch up with Dahlia."Where's he going?" Hermione gasped as the Gryffindor girls fought their way through the hassle of students in the corridors, trying to track Harry's movements through the crowd."That way!" Dahlia pointed to Harry's disappearing figure as he ducked down another corridor.The girls rushed after Harry, finally cornering him in an unused transfiguration classroom. The girls slowed as they stumbled through the door, unsure of what to do now that they had cornered him.Harry was standing with his back to the door, his arms were crossed against his chest, the tension in his shoulders visible from across the room.Hermione poke first, taking a hesitant step forward, voice gentle. "Harry?"He didn't turn around. His shoulders tensed, body flinching away from her, but he kept his back to them. The anger radiating off of him filled the room, though Hermione paid it no attention."I'm sorry, Harry," Hermione began gently. "Dahlia explained that you didn't want me in the tournament."Harry responded, his voice dripping with sarcasm, turning so only his profile was visible to them. "Let me guess: you appreciate the concern, but you're doing it anyways."Hermione bit her lip, but nodded determinedly. "Yeah, pretty much."Dahlia's eyes kept flickering back and forth between the two, waiting to see which one would erupt first. Hermione was tense, anticipating Harry's temper. Harry stood tense, as though preparing for a fight. His voice was clipped, harsh."I can't do the task and protect you, Hermione."To Dahlia's surprise, Hermione remained indifferent. She just shrugged as she spoke nonchalantly, "I guess it's a good thing I never asked you to, then."Harry spun around, anger written across his face, green eyes snapping. "You're -""Not your responsibility, Harry," Hermione said firmly, defiantly. "I make my own decisions."Harry was silent for a moment, before snarling, "Krum won't protect you!" as he spun back around, planting his back to her again.Hermione's face remained impassive as she rolled her eyes. She paused for several seconds, giving Harry the chance to continue. When he remained silent, Hermione sniffed, "Honestly, Harry, you sound like a jealous boyfriend. I can protect myself. I'm competing."With that she turned on her heel and stormed away, leaving no room for arguments. She paused in the doorstep before turning around and throwing over her shoulder, "Maybe you should consider that the reason I said yes to being Victor's second is because YOU didn't ask me; at least this way I could be in the maze with you. You don't have to do everything alone, Harry." She walked away with a huff, not bothering to wait for Harry's response.Dahlia lingered a moment, still not completely sure what had happened. Harry had spun back around to face the wall, hands clenched into fists. Dahlia stepped towards the door, deciding to give her champion space.Malfoy stormed up the stone steps to the headmaster's office, refusing to stop as he snarled the ridiculous password to the waiting gargoyle. He took the steps two at a time, urgency speeding him to the headmaster's office. He had spent the past two hours pacing his common room, trying to find a way to get Dahlia out of the predicament she had tangled herself in. He planned on addressing the Headmaster first - if anyone would want to protect Dahlia, it would be her guardian.The large door to the study was closed, but Draco paid it no attention. He barged into the room, stumbling through the threshold as the door swung open. He caught himself on a nearby coffee table, swinging his gaze wildly around the room until it fell on the headmaster.Dumbledore seemed unsurprised to see Malfoy standing in his office. He silently absorbed the Slytherin student's disheveled appearance, glancing up from the book he had been reading. The student was panting, his chest heaving as he labored to breathe. His robe hung unceremoniously off one shoulder, and his tie had come loose around his neck, hair mussed, sticking out at odd angles. The exact opposite from the Slytherin's typical put-together air."I do seem to be popular tonight; you're the second student to come see me this hour." Dumbledore seemed almost amused by this, a small gleam in his eye as he closed his book, leaning back in his chair as he waited for Malfoy to speak."She can't go into the maze," Malfoy blurted, running his hands through his hair. He paced back and forth in front of the door, his jaw clenched tightly, glaring at the headmaster."Have a seat, Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore spoke calmly, if not a little tiredly. He conjured Draco a cup of tea, gesturing for the Slytherin to take the seat before his desk."You have to protect her," Malfoy begged, his eyes latching onto Dumbledore's solemn blue ones. He strode forward to take the seat the headmaster had indicated for him, ignoring the cup of tea before him.Dumbledore sighed, suddenly looking much more tired than before. He removed the spectacles that usually perched on his face and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Believe me, Mr. Malfoy, don't you think I would prevent her from entering the maze if I could?""Why can't you?" Malfoy demanded angrily. Dumbledore was the headmaster; if anyone could bend the rules it was him.Dumbledore raised his brow at Malfoy, "I didn't realize you cared about Dahlia so strongly."A mangled sound left Draco's throat. He looked away, unable to hold the headmaster's gaze. His turned gaze bought him seconds to compose himself before glaring defiantly at the headmaster. "I don't!" He rasped, contouring his face into a sneer, plastering a mask of hate in place.Dumbledore gave the Slytherin a sad smile. "Ahhh... young love."Anger erupted in Malfoy. Does the headmaster not understand what he is allowing his ward to walk into? Draco took a deep breath, trying again. "Headmaster, you don't understand what's waiting in the maze."Dumbledore turned a sharp gaze to Draco, blue eyes hard. "I am aware of what is stocked in the maze, Mr. Malfoy. Nothing happens in Hogwarts I'm not aware of."Malfoy snarled at the dismissal; how could Dumbledore be so blind? A sob caught in his throat as he desperately slammed his hands down onto Dumbledore's desk, voice rising to a shout. "Please!" He cried, "You do not know what is happening oustide of the walls! Please, just... help her."Dumbledore gave him an odd, calculating look before his face hardened and he sighed. "I'll tell you the same thing I told the other student; the triwizard tournament regulations were set in place centuries ago, and are firm. The chosen seconds are now sworn in, and required to complete their obligations, or face the consequences of a broken magical vow."A strangle cry ripped from Draco's throat as for a fraction of a second he threw caution to the wind and considered confessing everything in the hopes that Dumbledore would take Dahlia far away. Instead, he snarled at the headmaster before turning on his heel, cursing. He fled the headmaster's study, shouting obscenities at the gargoyle on his way out.Draco ripped through the corridors. If Dumbledore wouldn't help, Draco would go to the next best person: Potter. Potter had dragged her into the bloody mess, and he would be the one to clean it up. Perhaps he could break the vow they had made, releasing Dahlia from the contract. Malfoy went on a rampage, throwing doors wide open, muttering curses at frightened first years he passed, striding through the halls with no abandon. He finally caught sight of Potter in a transfiguration classroom. The Gryffindor had his hands buried in his hands, sitting on the floor in the back, staring numbly out the window.Malfoy paused outside the door. Potter looked almost as desperate as he felt. The Gryffindor was so caught up in his own head he hadn't heard Malfoy arrive."Potter," He didn't even bother to hide his rage, voice dripping with venom.Harry didn't turn around; just sighed, his voice defeated and reserved. "What do you want, Malfoy?"Draco didn't hesitate to stride across the room until he towered about the sitting Gryffindor. "I want you to choose a different second."Potter turned to look at his, his face incredulous as he gaped upwards at the blond boy. The Gryffindor laughed bitterly, taking in Malfoy's disgruntled appearance. It was clear that Malfoy was as desperate as he felt. "Have a seat, mate."Malfoy glared suspiciously at Potter. They weren't friends; this wasn't friendly. Malfoy had come here to demand that he choose a different second; planning on not taking no as an answer. Strangely, Malfoy felt his legs moving until he had thrown himself on the ground next to his enemy, and was leaning against the wall behind him, grudgingly waiting on an explanation."Do you think I want her in that maze? Either of them?" Harry's words were sluggish, full of anger. Draco sent him a strange look, the slurred words surprising him."Are you drunk, Potter?"Harry grinned, tossing a bottle at Malfoy. The Slytherin caught it, spinning it in his hands to read the label. Firewhiskey. Malfoy gave a slight incline of his head to the boy next to him, a silent thanks before he lifted the bottle to his lips. Draco took a large swig, the liquid seared his throat in the best way as it went down. The two boys sat solemnly on the ground, with only the sound of the bottle being passed back and forth for several long minutes until Malfoy broke the silence."Don't call her into the maze," Malfoy forced the words out of his mouth, avoiding Potter's gaze as he said it. Harry glanced over to him, shaking his head in disbelief. "Please," Draco whispered, meeting Harry's eye.Harry held the Slytherin's gaze, observing him closely before reluctantly passing him the firewhiskey. Draco accepted it, painfully waiting for Harry's response."I know how you feel, you know?" Harry said, giving Malfoy an irritated look. "Hermione... she's a second."Malfoy didn't miss the desperation in Harry's voice. He hesitated, not sure what to say. This was Potter, for fucks sake. They hated each other; provoked each other every chance they got. Yet, in this moment, Malfoy felt like he actually understood the Gryffindor. Almost as though they were on the same team.Draco passed the firewhiskey back to Harry wordlessly. Harry glanced over at the Slytherin boy beside him. "Dumbledore -""Who's office do you think I just came from?" Malfoy demanded, rolling his eyes as though offended by the stupidity of the question. "He can't do anything."Harry glanced at Draco, grudging respect in his gaze. "You went to Dumbledore?""Of course I went to Dumbledore," Malfoy snapped, glaring at Harry. "You had to go and ask her to be your bloody second in a task where death is practically guaranteed! You bet your ass I went to the headmaster, Potter!"Harry stared blankly at the Slytherin, before bursting into laughter. Potter dropped his head into his hands, laughter shaking him Seething, Malfoy snatched the firewhiskey from his hands and took a swig while he watched Potter laugh."What the hell is so funny?" Malfoy muttered, shooting a sideways glare at the boy next to him.Harry hiccupped, his laughter slowly dying. "I find it amusing that you went to the headmaster demanding Dahlia not enter because I stormed up there right after dinner to demand Hermione not be permitted."Malfoy glanced at Potter, his lips curling up into a sarcastic smile. "It's even more amusing when you realize that the both of us ended up here, drunk together over the whole ordeal."Harry laughed, nodding as he glanced to the near empty firewhiskey bottle. "Yeah, that's strange."A comfortable silence fell between the boys until Harry spoke again. "Did he tell you he couldn't stop it?""Yeah," Malfoy said glumly, taking another swig of the firewhiskey. He shared a defeated look with Harry."I didn't ask her to be my second, Draco," Harry turned to fully face the desperate Slytherin beside him. "I couldn't bring myself to ask Ron or Hermione. The risk... all for what? A stupid tournament?" Harry spat dejectedly, shaking his head. "I didn't even want to do this in the first place, why should I force them into it?"Malfoy listened silently, never once turning his attention away from Harry's face as he continued to speak. "I was torn. One night, Dahlia was in the common room. I told her what was happening, and she offered right there on the spot."Malfoy's jaw was clenched as he ground out, "You should have said no."Harry dropped his head in his hands. "I know; I know. She wouldn't take no for an answer." Harry's voice turned desperate, as though begging Malfoy to understand why he accepted. "She insisted; and I couldn't say no. Not when no meant saying yes to Ron or Hermione."Malfoy growled, turning furiously to Harry, fire back in his eyes. "So, when it comes down to sacrificing someone, you chose her."Harry looked miserably up at Malfoy's burning eyes. "Malfoy...""No!" Malfoy pushed himself to his feet, wobbling slightly. He must have drank more than he realized. He reached out for the wall to steady himself as he glared down Potter. "You... she's..." words failed him as he glared at the drunk Gryffindor beside him. "You're the reason she's going to die."Harry looked at the Slytherin with a stricken look on his face before Malfoy turned, and stumbled from the room.

For the next few days Draco mauled over Harry's drunken words. The battle inside him raged on, but mostly Malfoy was just furious. Furious that he was in this situation. Furious with himself for being a coward. Furious with Dahlia for being so bloody noble. Furious that despite how much hatred he housed for her, she was all he could think about. Furious that he even felt anything for her in the first place.Furious that the third task was a week away, and he was painfully aware that he hadn't spoken to her in months - not truly talked, anyways. Painfully, painfully aware that they had only had one conversation that didn't result in a fight. Regretfully aware he hadn't kissed her since before Christmas.Malfoy had added Potter to his "avoid-like-the-plague" list, refusing to acknowledge or speak to him since their night with firewhiskey. Not that it was hard, considering than ran in complete opposite circles. Something had shifted between them that night - something that felt suspiciously like a grain of respect and mutual understanding. Malfoy didn't have time or the effort to unpack his changing emotions to Potter, so instead he avoided him. In hallways, meals, classes - Draco went out of his way to avoid anyone from Gryffindor house in general.Draco was still furious with Potter; after all he was the one who had taken Dahlia as his second. A small part of him realized that maybe Potter had as little choice as he did in the matter.All that remained was whether or not Draco should warn Dahlia of the plans he'd overheard - a decision that was keeping him up at night. The thought of Dahlia entering the maze unknowing made him sick; likewise, he knew that if he betrayed his family and was found out he would face worse consequences than he could even imagine. Malfoy still hadn't decided whether to warn Dahlia when one day he bumped into her in the corridors. She was walking beside a Ravenclaw girl down the Charm's corridor, presumably heading to her next class. He almost hadn't noticed her until someone shouted her name."Oi! Dahlia!" A boy was jogging after her, one that looked suspiciously like a Weasley. Malfoy subconsciously picked up his pace in an attempt to catch their conversation. He'd noticed the twins eyeing Dahlia, sidling up to her at random points throughout the day. He dislike their familiarity with her. He strained his neck, trying to catch a glimpse of who the boy was but the hallway was too crowded.Malfoy saw Dahlia pause, turning so he had a view of her face as she glanced back behind her. That meant he was front row for the smile that lit up her face when she realized who it was. "George!"A snort left Malfoy's nose. Of course it was a Weasley. One of the twins. He watched as the tall lanky redhead hugged Dahlia, falling in pace beside her. He ignored the jealous jab that shot through him at the sight of Dahlia in his arms. Draco broke into a light jog, shoving through third years as he tried to get close enough to them to continue hearing their conversation.He caught up further down the corridor, just in time to hear George's voice sound concerned."-worried about you."Dahlia brushed him off with a smile and comforting look. "I'm fine, honestly George. I've just been busy preparing for the third task with Harry.""Alright," the twin shot her a wink that made Malfoy roll his eyes. "I gotta get to Potions; see you at dinner?"Dahlia agreed, and hugged the Weasley twin one last time before he continued down the hall. Malfoy decided it was now or never, and cleared his throat, turning the corner and walking into her eye line. "Dumbledore?"She spun around, her eyes flying wide open at his voice. She seemed shocked to find him speaking to her, much less standing in front of her. Quickly she recovered from her shock, masking her face to a cool exterior. She gave him an almost bored look. "Malfoy."Malfoy fidgeted uncomfortably back and forth, her cool voice a huge difference from the warm tone she'd used with the Weasley twin a moment ago. "I need to talk to you."Dahlia looked wary, squinting her eyes at him. "About what?"Draco looked back and forth around the hallway. There were too many people here; too many unknowing eavesdroppers. He jerked his head at Dahlia, indicating for her to follow him. She hesitated, and for a moment Draco's heart plummeted. She was going to walk away; she didn't want to hear what he said.Then her feet fell instep behind him, and he felt a wave of relief. She padded along silently behind him until he ducked into an abandoned bathroom.Dahlia hesitantly followed him into the bathroom, turning to face him as he locked the door behind them. She didn't want to encourage his behavior, but her curiosity bested her, demanding to know what he wished to speak with her about. What could he possibly need to say? He seemed to have said everything he had needed to say after Christmas - his actions had said enough. Dahlia crossed her arms as Malfoy stopped and turned around to face her.For a moment both just stood, staring at each other from across the room. Dahlia tried to conceal it, but her body reacted just to seeing him after all this time. His beautiful eyes hadn't changed. He looked more tired, perhaps, but the stoney grey eyes still managed to send tingles down her spine as he hungrily looked at her, drinking her in.She could feel the nervous energy wafting off of him, the hesitation. His stance reflected it; arms crossed as though guarding himself. Dahlia cocked her head, looking at him with curiosity."I have to tell you something," Malfoy whispered, taking a step towards her. Dahlia couldn't move; his gaze held her captive. She was frozen in time, caught in his grey eyes as he slowly took one step after another towards her. The tension between them was growing by the second as the space between them dwindled. He stopped a few inches from her. He was close enough that she could smell his cologne, the mint and citrus smell sending delightful tingles down her spine. Dahlia didn't dare move; just continued to stare into the grey eyes that had captivated her. Her heart rate sped up at his nearness, both with concern and anticipation. She hadn't seen him nervous before - what could possibly cause him this much anxiety?"Okay...""Please don't go into the maze," Draco whispered, bringing his hand to trail it down her face. His touch shocked her, produced chill bumps up and down her arms. "Please." His voice was low, begging, desperate.Dahlia shook herself out of the daze he had put her in. She leaned back from him slightly, incredulous, "Wait, that's what you wanted to talk about?"Malfoy's eyes hardened slightly as his hand fell away from her cheek. "Yes."Dahlia sighed impatiently, taking a full step back from him, putting distance between their bodies. "Then you're wasting your breath. Do you really think I would leave Harry to face the maze alone?"Irritation rose in Malfoy, but he pushed it down. He needed to find a way to make her understand, needing to make her see the danger she was in. "You don't understand what's waiting in the maze!"Dahlia's eyes flashed as she crossed her arms. She stuck her chin out stubbornly, amber eyes flashing. "Harry and I have been preparing for this task for well over a month. We've researched the monsters and spells that they've put in the maze before. We're ready."Draco shook his head, closing the distance between them. He gripped her shoulders, leaning down so that he was practically nose to nose with her. She needed to heed his warnings. "Oh? Because Dumbledore's Daughter and the Chosen One can't be beat, right?" He gave her shoulders a gentle shake. "Listen to me! There is something dangerous in that maze."Dahlia's gaze turned hard, and she pushed him away from her, breaking his hold on her shoulders. "Why do you care, Malfoy? All these months you haven't said a word to me, except to pick a fight. You're hot and then you're cold; I think you want me and then I'm no better than dirt on your shoe. So, for the love of Merlin, please, tell me why I should listen to you and your warnings?""Because if you don't you're going to end up dead!" Malfoy bellowed, looking at her with a face of shock. The words tumbled from his mouth before he could catch them. "The moment you step in the maze you're signing your death warrant, and I can't protect you!"Dahlia looked blankly at the Slytherin boy in front of her. He was breaking down, grabbing at her robes desperately. She hadn't seen him undone like this before - hadn't ever seen him desperate. She placed a hand comfortingly on his arm, alarmed eyes meeting his as she silently willed him to explain."Please," he begged, his voice cracking. He lifted his eyes to meet hers, the desperation oozing from every pore. She gasped; his beautiful grey eyes were swimming with tears and sincerity. Draco reached for her, cupping her face gently. "Please, Dahlia," he murmured, voice stirring something deep inside her. "I can't let you die."Dahlia closed her eyes against the emotions swirling inside her. This was Malfoy's MO; he would be loving and caring for a moment, and the next he would be storming away. Despite that, her traitorous body responded to him. Her heart rate increased, her cheeks blushing at his proximity. Chill bumps formed down her arms as his thumb caressed her cheek. She leaned into him subconsciously, almost unwillingly. Her body relaxed in his arms, her mind continuing to spin."Malfoy..." the words were a whisper. Gently she placed her hands on his face, cupping his face back. Resolution formed in her, determination came to the surface. "I have to do this.""No, you don't," he snarled, giving her a cross look, anger flashing in his grey eyes. "You don't have to do anything.""I made a promise," Dahlia brushed his hair out of his eyes, loving how soft it was against her fingers. He jerked away from her caress, her hand falling back down to her side. "I can't leave Harry alone in there."Draco squeezed his eyes shut, trying to calm the panic that was rising within. He couldn't do it; he couldn't protect her if she went into that maze. He tried to collect his thoughts, but all that was swirling in his head was images of her dead body, and his father's face. For a few long seconds, Malfoy debated on what to do, torn between making her believe the truth and keeping his family's secret.Malfoy opened his eyes to find Dahlia's eyes studying his face. The second his eyes met her amber ones he knew he was lost;; the words left his mouth before he could stop them."The Death Eaters are planning to kill Potter."Dahlia's eyes flew open wide in horror, body frozen. She stared at him, not moving, not blinking. "Wh... what?""The Death Eaters are planning to kill Potter. I think they put something in the maze to make it look like an accident." There. He had said it. He had expected a rush of guilt to collapse on him but instead he felt oddly... free. He watched Dahlia process his words, praying that she would realize the danger she was in. Hoping that she would be smart enough to not enter the maze now.Dahlia's eyes filled with panic for half a moment before turning to steel. "How do you know this?""My parents," Draco admitted, relieved that she finally seemed to understand the severity of the situation. Thankful to finally have her full attention. "I heard them talking about it."Dahlia opened and closed her mouth, her eyes flicking around the room as she silently panicked. Then, all at once, she exhaled and clenched her small hands into fists. "If this is how you were planning on convincing me not to go into the maze, it won't work.""Dahlia!" Malfoy gasped, incredulous. Was she serious? She was going to disregard the idea that there were going to be Death Eaters in the maze? "You can't be serious. You're going to go in knowing everything in that maze is going to be targeting Potter?"Dahlia's eye twitched as she glared at the Slytherin before her. She gave an exasperated sigh, throwing her hands up into the air, "Of course I am!"Draco balked. "No!" He crashed her body into his chest, needing to feel her in his arms. She grunted at the impact, but he paid her no mind. "You don't understand what you're doing. They will kill you if you stand between them and Potter."Dahlia clung to him. She knew she shouldn't, but in that moment he was a sip of water and she was parched. He hadn't touched her since before Christmas holidays, and her body reacted on its own. She wrapped her arms around his waist and let him crush her into his chest, welcoming the warmth she found there."Let him take someone else into the maze, please," Draco's voice was hoarse as he pleaded with her, face buried in her hair. "Please, Dahlia, I can't watch you die."Dahlia squeezed her eyes against the tears that were threatening to spill over. How could she explain to him that if she died, it was fine? How could she tell him she was a mistake and shouldn't have been born. That she was expendable. The last of the Peverell's should have died years ago. Her death would only right the timeline - correct history."It has to be this way," Dahlia whispered, putting her hands on Draco's chest to gently push him away, despite the urge to remain in his arms. "It has to be me."Rage. Red, hot, unstoppable rage. His grey eyes flashed, hands curling into fists as he yelled defiantly. Malfoy turned from her to slam his fist into the wall behind them. "No!" He roared, hitting the wall again, chunks of stone and plaster breaking off. "Anyone but you."Tears fell down Dahlia's cheeks at his display of emotion. Oh how she wanted to run to him and explain everything, but common sense stopped her. Inside her chest it felt like her heart was exploding, bursting into a million pieces. She choked back a sob, "It has to be me. I-I'm the only expendable one. -I'm so sorry," she sobbed. Malfoy whirled around, a shocked incredulous look on his face. For one second they stood staring, Draco's disheveled hair and red eyes matching Dahlia's heaving chest and disgruntled clothes.Then, with a soft cry, Dahlia turned and fled from the bathroom, leaving Draco to his anger."Fuck!" Malfoy threw his fist, shattering the mirror on the wall next to him.

Dahlia stood in the champions tent with Harry, waiting to be taken to the starting line. It was the dreaded day of the third task. She'd gotten no sleep the night before, mind too anxious about the task. Her and Harry were both silent, too nauseous to talk. They had been told to wait in the champion's tent until someone came to get them for the starting line. The minutes ticked by slowly, every step outside their tent jarring them. Finally Dahlia turned to Harry, her eyes dull, desperate for conversation. "Are you scared?"Harry didn't meet her eyes as he answered. "I'm more scared of something happening to Hermione than I am anything."Dahlia gave a brief, jerky nod. She had passed Malfoy's warning along the day after he had told her, and Harry's reaction had been strange. He didn't seem upset that the Death Eaters were plotting against him; he had seemed angry that Malfoy had told her rather than him. He'd just seemed angry in general. He'd told her he wouldn't call her into the maze; and she had responded she would be entering once the ten minutes were up regardless. He hadn't pushed the matter after that.In fact, they hadn't spoken of the possible murder plot since the initial conversation a few days ago. It hung over their heads like a storm cloud, threatening and hazardous but inescapable.The flap to the tent was thrown back, startling her and Harry. They both spun around, looks of relief flashing across both of their faces when they realized it was Draco. Neither of them were quite ready to enter the maze yet."I need to talk to Potter," Malfoy ground out, not even looking at Dahlia. Dahlia opened her mouth to speak, but Draco fixed her with a glare. "Alone."Dahlia looked between the two boys, suspiciously squinting at them both before turning on her heel and exiting the tent.Once her footsteps retreated Malfoy turned a dark gaze to Potter, who held it with equal menace.The boys glared at each other; Draco worked his jaw a few times before grinding out, "I swear to god, Potter, if you don't bring her back alive..."Harry held his gaze, guffawing, "What? Or what, Malfoy?"Malfoy clenched and unclenched his fists. His temper was boiling, hard to control. Malfoy took a step towards Harry, seething. He opened his mouth to respond, but Harry wasn't done talking, interrupting the Slytherin before he had a chance to speak."You think I don't understand how you feel? Do you think I didn't already hunt down Krum and make the same threats?" Harry growled at Malfoy, swinging his arms around the champions tent. "Do you think I wanted to be here? Do you think I want her risking her life?" When Malfoy remained silent Potter's voice rose to a scream. "Well? Do you think I wanted to choose who gets to possibly die?"Malfoy had no words. He watched as Potter became completely derailed, pacing back and forth brandishing his arms about. The Gryffindor was honestly losing it, his green eyes wild. Potter stopped yelling to throw his head back, laughing almost maniacally. "Why the fucking hell would I want any of this?" Potter whispered, fixing his wild gaze on Draco. "Malfoy, I -"Malfoy had had enough. He strode forward, and hit Harry across the face. Potter stumbled back, an expression of pain and shock mixed on his face. Malfoy gripped Harry's shoulders, giving him a violent shake. "Potter!" Malfoy roared. "Pull. It. Together!" Another slap.Harry's eyes widened, but Draco wasn't done. "I got it!" Malfoy screamed in Harry's face, the anger in his expression sobering Harry up. "I get you didn't want this! But it's happening! So pull it together and figure out how to get her back to me alive." Malfoy was seething, nose to nose with Potter. Potter didn't have the luxury of falling apart right now; not when Dahlia's life was in the balance.A tense moment passed, before Harry gave a single, jerky nod and Malfoy released him, brushing the wrinkles from his clothes. Malfoy stalked towards the entrance to the tent before stopping and turning around. "She thinks she's expendable." Malfoy wasn't sure what possessed him to tell Potter that, but it felt important.Harry's face twitched, only for a second, but enough to tell Malfoy that that statement didn't sit well with him. Malfoy drew a ragged breath, unsure what was possessing him to make him speak so honestly. Harry seemed to understand what the Slytherin couldn't put into words."If it comes down to me or her, Malfoy, you've got my word it won't be her."Malfoy met Harry's gaze, his throat tightening. He managed a small nod to Potter before the back tent flap opened, and Dahlia reentered.The awkward tension in the room intensified as Dahlia looked between the enemies. She took in the redness of Harry's cheek, as well as Malfoy's flustered appearance. Brow raised in silent question."Um..." Dahlia started to speak but trailed off into silence, unsure of what to say."I was just leaving," Malfoy grunted, turning to leave. He had one foot out the tent when he stopped in his tracks. He turned to find Dahlia still standing where she had been, staring at his back.With an aggravated growl, Malfoy spun around and marched up to her. He aggressively grabbed her face in his two hands, and crashed his lips down on hers. For a moment she didn't respond, too surprised to move.Then her arms were around his neck, and her hands were tangled in his hair, a breathy moan escaping her lips. She responded to him, opening her mouth. His tongue probed inside her mouth, dancing with hers as his hands slid around to grip her hair. He angled her head up, giving him more access to her mouth.A moan escaped her, a delightful shiver tingling through his body, and he abruptly ended the passionate moment. He pulled away, leaning his forehead on hers, their heavy breaths mixing in the space between them. Malfoy's thumb caressed Dahlia's cheek, and her eyes fluttered open to meet his. "You aren't expendable to me," Draco hissed forcefully. "Do you understand?"Dahlia couldn't form words. She tried, but none came so instead she nodded, still breathless from their kiss."Words, Dumbledore, use your words."Hissing at the use of her surname, she looked up at him and snarled, "Understood, Malfoy."He didn't seem put off by her anger. Rather, he seemed pleased with himself. He gave a nod to her, releasing her and backing away towards the flap to the tent. He locked eyes with Harry for half a second, one foot out the door. The boys seemed to have a silent, nonverbal conversation before Potter inclined his head to the Slytherin, who did the same. Then the blonde boy disappeared through the flap of the tent as quickly as he had come.Dahlia waited exactly three seconds until Draco's foot falls had disappeared before whirling around to Harry. He smirked at her, giving her a wink. "Guess whatever you were didn't end."Dahlia rolled her eyes, subconsciously lifting a hand to her lips, still feeling the pressure of his lips on hers. They still felt swollen from his kiss. "Piss off, Potter."Harry shrugged, looking at the flap Malfoy had just exited from. Dahlia's gaze followed his as she suppressed the urge to run after Draco, to abandon the task and the danger that accompanied it. After a moment she turned, closed her eyes and rallied her thoughts."Ten minutes until the start of the final event! Ten minutes, folks!" The announcer could be heard, his voice magically enhanced to reach the surrounding forest.Harry winced, flicking his eyes to meet Dahlia's. Her's were wide with panic, face pale."It's going to be okay," Harry said softly, not sure which one of them he was trying to convince. He locked eyes with Dahlia, their shared panic bonding them.Dahlia exhaled shakily. "Remember what I told -""I know," Harry cut her off sharply. "I... look. Everything's going to come for us in that maze anyways. We can't focus on it. It's one thing at a time."Dahlia's head shook in a jerky nod, her body trembling. "R-right."Harry's eyes fastened on hers. "Just... if it comes down to it, and there really are Death Eaters in there, let me handle it."Dahlia instantly shook her head, rejecting his words. "No, I can't, we're-""Dahlia!" Harry snarled, pacing around. His voice was sharp, demanding. "They'll be coming for me, not you. If they're really there, you have to find Hermione and get out."Dahlia gaped at him, wide eyed. "Harry -""It's my fight," Harry said firmly, finally. "Just get her - and you - out alive." Harry gave her a once over. "Otherwise, Malfoy will kill me if the Death Eaters don't."A spark of excitement shivered through Dahlia at Malfoy's protectiveness, but she suppressed it. Instead she met Harry's hard gaze with a cold one of her own. "Let's just take it one thing at a time," she echoed his words back to him, unable to make him any kind of promise than involved her abandoning him.Harry winced, but didn't push her any further. He didn't get the chance to, as Professor McGonagall arrived, smacking the outside of their tent."Potter! Dumbledore!"Both of them winced, but turned to face the tent as though preparing for their execution. The transfiguration teacher poked her head inside the tent, her frosty gaze landing on them. "It's time."The Gryffindors followed their Head of House out of the tent and towards the entrance to the maze. Stands had been set up in a semi circle around the entrance, where the entire school had gathered to watch the event. Dahlia felt light headed as her eyes desperately searched the crowds for Malfoy, but she couldn't find him. Faces all swam together, houses intermixed, schools jumbled together as everyone gathered for the grand finale.Her heart rate picked up, her knees were becoming weak. Dahlia blinked back tears as the panic began to fully set in. She was about to break down when Harry's hand slipped into hers, gripping it so tight it was almost painful.That contact sent a jolt of electricity through her arm. It was almost as if he had anchored her with that touch. She mentally shook herself, blinking back the tears that had almost over flowed. She clung to his hand back, squeezing until their hold on each other was so tight it threatened to cut off the blood supply to their hands. Harry said nothing, he didn't even glance at her as he continued to walk hand in hand with her towards the entrance.Professor McGonagall left them standing there at the center of the arena, with the Beauxbatons pair on their left, and the Durmstrang on their right. Dahlia and Harry both looked over to lock eyes with Hermione. She was paler than normal, hair braided back away from her face. She held her head high regardless, a true Gryffindor. She was also clutching Krum's hand, who was looking slightly sweatier than usual. Hermione managed a weak smile, mouthing It'll be okay at them.Dahlia nodded back, unable to form words. Harry's grip intensified on her hand as the announcer began to speak."It is time! What we have all been waiting for: The Third Task!" His voice bellowed throughout the stands, silencing the cheers. "The champions will enter the maze alone. They must survive the first ten minutes alone in the maze; after that the seconds are free to enter immediately, or may wait to be called in by their Champion."The announcer paused, letting his voice roll over the crowds before continuing. "Each champion and second have been given matching bracelets. They are charmed to direct you to your partner's location."A small course of relief washed through Dahlia. She had never confessed it, but her biggest fear was entering the maze and being unable to find Harry. Dahlia looked down at her right wrist to find a slim black bracelet appearing there. It was nothing more than a metal ring around her wrist. An intricate design was branded into the metal, something she couldn't discern at first glance. A quick glance at Harry's right wrist showed an identical bracelet with similar markings."The bracelets, however, won't work indefinitely. At the start of the horn, the magic will activate. After the champions ten minutes are up, should a second choose to immediately enter the maze they shall have 15 minutes where the bracelet will get warmer the closer you get to your champion. The further away, the colder it will get. Should a champion choose to wait until their champion summons them, they will have only 5 minutes to find them. Of course, if your champion is in danger when they call you, any more than five minutes will be useless anyways."With that cryptic message, the announcer turned the wand over to the Ministry Official."Champions, to the starting line."Harry gave Dahlia's hand a light squeeze before releasing it and stepping forward. Dahlia felt a moment of panic as his hand released hers, but it vanished as she watched him boldly step forward. Harry strode forward confidently, any sign of fear gone. His bravery reassured Dahlia if he could do this, so could she."At the start of the horn, you may enter the maze."The crowds went silent, the champions froze. A moment of suspenseful silence passed before a horn was sounded and the champions sprinted into the maze. The entrance towered before them, the bushes over 12 feet tall. A mysterious fog rolled out from the foot path of the maze, an eerie, foreboding sense of doom. The darkness of the maze swallowed the champions up a few yards past the torches, leaving the fog swirling in their wake.Dahlia and Hermione shared a worried look. They stood where the champions had left them, their eyes glued to the magical timer floating above the entrance. The minute ticked by slowly, feeling like an eternity. No sound rose from the maze - not a scream, not a rustle, not a single sound of life. It was as though the maze had swallowed the champions whole.Dahlia couldn't resist craning her neck backwards to scan the stands behind her. Her eyes raked through the rows of people, trying to find any sight of a certain pale Slytherin boy. A sob caught in her throat; after his display earlier she thought he would at least come watch. She wanted to see him one last time. Minutes ticked off the clock as she continued to search the crowd for him. Bile rose in her throat as she failed to find him, her body visibly beginning to shake."Dahlia," Hermione soft whisper from a few feet away anchored her. Dahlia snapped her head to look at her friend. Hermione nodded her head to Dahlia's left. She turned and was shocked to see Draco Malfoy standing on the field - not in the stands with the other spectators. No, he was on the field, hands shoved in his pockets, staring at her with a hungry, desperate look in his eyes.The second their eyes met his gaze widened, a longing gleam in them. She held his gaze, reveling in how even in a moment of panic he was able to anchor her with one glance. He'd made sure she could see him. Given her reassurance that he was here. She drew confidence from his look, determination to make it back, for him alone if nothing else. For the possibility of him.Draco gave her a nod of encouragement before turning away, and striding off of the field. Dahlia released a breath she hadn't known she'd been holding, watching his retreating back until he was out of sight. She turned back to face the entrance of the maze, eyes flickering to the time left before entry.Two minutes left. An eerie sense of calm overtook her, relaxing her quivering body. Grim determination settled over her, her face morphing in to a fierce look."Are you going in immediately?" Hermione whispered, a quiver to her voice."Yes," Dahlia said, her voice sounding stronger than she felt, giving Hermione a look of encouragement."Me too." The girls shared a glance, a small smirk playing on both their lips as Hermione added, "He tried to tell you not to, didn't he?"Dahlia shrugged, turning her attention back to the looming entrance of the maze. "I never was one to listen anyways."Hermione laughed, surprising them both. They fell silent as they watched the seconds tick by.45 seconds....44 seconds...43 seconds...Her heart was pounding in her chest. Dahlia could feel it in her hands, her feet. All she could hear was white noise as she remained glued to the clock. The maze entrance towered above them. The hedges were at least twelve feet high, and the maze extended as far as the eye could see, tunneling to the left and right, extending back into the forest The entrance to the maze was lit, but once you passed the torch-light at the entrance everything was dark. The maze was ominous, small tendrils of smoke and fog rising from it, clouding visibility.A female's scream erupted from the maze, and the Beauxbatons champion to Dahlia's left cried out. He was staring desperately at the clock, the seconds now excruciatingly slow. Dahlia felt her stomach twist, panic filling her. Fleur needed help. She almost ran in immediately, John's wild gaze stopping her as he caught her wide eyes. A ministry official was restraining him, preventing him from entering early.21 seconds...20 seconds...19 seconds..."Together?" Dahlia whispered to Hermione, tearing her gaze from John to Hermione. The thought of entering that maze alone, after Fleur's scream, was haunting."Together," Hermione agreed, a note of relief in her voice as her face settled into grim determination.5 seconds....4 seconds....3 seconds....A second horn sounded, deafening all other sounds. Dahlia and Hermione sprinted forward, their feet pounding the ground as they pulled their wands and entered the maze.Malfoy stormed from the champions tent. He could still taste Dahlia on his lips, and it was taking every ounce of self control to resist storming back in there and demanding she not do this. He knew that was pointless; she had to do this. So instead, he'd kissed her as though it was the last time. Because despite his warnings and his desperate pleas it could be.A desperate cry left his throat, angry and distraught. Malfoy changed directions, sprinting back up to the castle to his dormitory. There was one thing he hadn't tried; one person he hadn't talked to. The only person he could talk to that was on the other side of this.His mother.Draco barged into his dorm room, throwing items out of his trunk desperately as he searched through it. Finally his fingers collided with a small paper weight, engraved with the Malfoy insignia.Malfoy clutched it in one hand, running his fingers over his family's crest as he murmured the words, "Transporticus Immedius."Instantly there was a bright light and he was lifted into the air. The port key glimmered before contorting. Malfoy squeezed his eyes shut - he hated this part. Everything went all contorted for a few seconds and then a bright light hit his eyes. When he opened them he was standing in the sitting room of Malfoy Manor."Mother!" Draco yelled, tucking the Port Key into his pocket as he sprinted through the hall, throwing open doors as he searched the wing. "Mother!""Draco?" His mother's soft voice drifted from the level below him, her voice magically enhanced to reach him. "Draco, is that you?""Mother!" Draco took the stairs down three at a time, jumping over the landing as he rushed to his mother's side. He found her in the drawing room, one she used only when she was expecting company. "Mother -"He barged into the room to find his mother sitting in an armchair sipping a cup of tea. She rose from the table as soon as he entered the room, her mouth forming an o. Her shock was apparent, stunning her for a moment before she surged forward."What are you doing here?" Narcissa Malfoy rushed to her son's side, her hands running down his arms as she worried over him. "Is everything alright?"Draco brushed his mother's hands off of him impatiently. "No, mother, everything isn't alright." He snapped harshly at her, striding past her, arms folded across his chest. "I know of the Death Eaters plans for the tournament."He didn't have time to be demure about this. Narcissa backed away in shock, her hand flying to cover her mouth. "Lower your voice, Draco!" She hissed at him, her eyes darting around the room as though worried they weren't alone. Slowly she lowered her hand from her mouth, leaning into her son so she could whisper in his ear. "How do you know of this?""I heard over Christmas break," Malfoy told her bluntly, though he lowered his voice so only she could hear him. "I... I heard of their plans for Potter." Draco inhaled a shaky breath, his lips forming a tight line as his eyes met his mother's. "And for his second."Narcissa blanched, obviously unaware her son had known of the Death Eater's movement. "And?""And I thought you would want to know that Potter's second is Dumbledore's ward," Draco blurted, turning away to avoid his mother's gaze. He took a seat, trying to appear unaffected by the news he delivered. Better she think he was here to aid their cause than to protect Dahlia. If his father were to find out that Malfoy had tried to intervene on a Death Eater's assignment the resulting consequences would be... severe. For him, for his mother, and for Dahlia. No, this was better.Mrs. Malfoy gaped at her son. She blinked slowly as she processed her son's information, following him forward to sit in a seat next to him. "V-very well, Draco. I shall pass along your information."Draco gave a curt nod of his head. "The Death Eaters would be well advised to leave her alone - who knows the repercussions Albus Dumbledore would reign on us if anything happened to his ward."Narcissa seemed taken back by his words, studying him intently as a small smile lifted her lips. "Ah... it's a girl?"Draco winced, turning to give his mother a sneer, haughtily demanding. "So what if it is?"Narcissa regarded her son curiously before giving a small shrug as she rose from her seat, peering down at Draco. "You've never taken an interest in the affairs of Death Eaters before. It's just curious that you chose this task... especially come to find out it concerns a girl. A mother wonders, is all."Draco rose from his seat, taking an angry step towards his mother, his eyes flashing with fury, masking his fear. "Really, mother?" He spat venomously, as though she'd put a foul taste in his mouth. Fear clogged his throat, but he only let the fury show through. His mother was scarily close to the truth. "You think I would look twice at Dumbledore's ward?" He spoke the words as if they were poison, nothing more than the dirt on his shoe. "You think I would sully our family name with some simpleton that caught Dumbledore's pity? Her blood status is unknown - probably a mudblood. Is that the Malfoy legacy you thought I would give you?"Narcissa was shocked at her son's sudden violent display, his words causing any sentimental looks to fall from her face. "Perhaps I was wrong," she muttered uneasily. She straightened herself to her full height, and gave her son a dismissive look. "I'll pass your information along and inform the others that it would be... unwise... to take action against Potter's second."Draco gave a shaky nod, meeting his mother's eyes, the anger simmering, but controlled. "Thank you."Narcissa said nothing, just simply turned her back on her son. Draco took the hint that their meeting was over, and pulled the portkey out from his pocket. He murmured the spell to the stone, and braced himself for the transport back to Hogwarts.He stumbled back into his room. Draco didn't hesitate as he tossed the port key on his bed and sprinted back through the dungeons. He had to get back to the forest; he had to see Dahlia off into the maze.Strangely, he had faith in his mother's words. She would speak to the Death Eaters, tell them who Dahlia was. Maybe Dumbledore's name would be enough to protect her after all.That didn't stop him from sprinting out of the castle and down the pathway to the forest. He ran until his lungs were on fire, and his legs felt like lead. He burst into the arena where the stands had been erected. Draco ignored the entrances as he pushed through the crowds of people. He skirted around to a maintenance entrance, and let himself onto the field to the left of where the champions stood.Draco scanned the field, noticing that only four people remained waiting at the entrance to the maze. Quick glance told him that the seconds all stood waiting - the champions had entered already. His heart leapt as his eyes landed on Dahlia, relief flooding his body. He wasn't too late.She was looking behind her, scanning the crowd. There was a manic look in the way she kept twisting back and forth, as though desperate to find someone. Draco stared at her, willing her to look at him but she never did. Rather, it was Hermione who caught him staring at Dahlia.Her eyes flew open wide as she looked between him and her fellow Gryffindor. She seemed to take in Dahlia's desperate glancing around the stands, and Draco's hungry gaze as he stared at her. Realization flashed in Hermione's eyes, and he saw her whisper something to Dahlia.Dahlia's attention snapped to her, and Draco watched as Hermione nodded at him. Dahlia turned quickly, her eyes snapping to his. The moment their gazes collided he watched relief wash over her. She visibly relaxed, her eyes boring into his, her fear apparent.Draco felt his stomach lurch as he realized she had been looking for him in the stands.A desperate need to hold her, to protect her from what was going to come washed over him. His arms remained useless at his sides as instead he stared back at her, hoping she understood what he couldn't say.She gave a small smile, and Draco couldn't help but to give her a nod of encouragement. She could do this. She had to do this. That seemed to reassure her, and she lifted her head up slightly. Draco broke her gaze, and turned away. He headed back to underneath the stands. There was no way he could watch this while surrounded by his fellow classmates. No, he needed somewhere private to watch. Somewhere to fall apart if needed.

Dahlia's feet pounded against the hard ground of the maze, Hermione to her right. They had just passed the torches at the entrance to the tunnel, and all that loomed before them was darkness. The tunnel entrance to the maze extended in front of them indefinitely, the air noticeably cooler in the confines of the maze."Lumos!" Dahlia murmured, waving her wand above her head. A small light appeared at the tip of her wand, illuminating the path a few feet before them. Hermione did the same, her wand adding additional light. The fog caused creepy shadows to billow out in front of them, setting Dahlia's nerves on edge.The thudding of John's footsteps could be heard from behind the girls as he raced to find Fleur. Dahlia glanced behind her to see that it was only the three of them who had entered the maze; Cedric's second had remained behind. That thought didn't settle well with Dahlia, but she pushed it from her mind as the first cross roads appeared from the misty gloom before them.All three seconds skidded to a halt, their gazing swinging between the three new tunnels. A strong wind was blowing from the tunnel to their right. The path straight before them was pitch dark, and dead silent. A fog filled tunnel lay to their left, the fog moving along with an unseen breeze.Dahlia took a step forward, blindly sticking her arm out. She spun in all directions, arm extended. The bracelet on her wrist reamined cold until she faced the dark tunnel straight ahead of her. Dahlia glanced to her right to find Hermione testing the directions as well."Straight ahead," Hermione said in a high voice, head spinning around as though looking for potential threats."Me too," Dahlia said, sharing a relieved glance with her fellow Gryffindor."Left." John's voice wavered as he looked hesitantly at the fog filled path before him. His face was settled into determination, Fleur's scream egging him on.Dahlia thought of going with him; Fleur needed help, and Dahlia considered her a friend, but she forced herself to focus. She was sworn to Harry for this task; she had to focus on him. The three stood in silence for a moment before Dahlia offered the Beauxbatons boy encouragement. "Good luck.""And to you," John nodded as his competitors before illuminating his wand, and stepping down his tunnel."Let's go," Hermione whispered, tugging at Dahlia's arm. "We only have fifteen minutes.""Shit," Dahlia cursed. She had completely forgotten about the time restrictions. Her and Hermione took off at a jog down the dead silent path. They jogged in complete silence for almost a minute before coming to the end. It forked in two directions, left and right. Dahlia stuck her arm out, her bracelet burning hot at the left fork.Hermione nodded, jerking her head to the left indicating she had to go left as well. The girls continued jogging, their heads swiveling in all directions. So far, there had been no sign of any type of threat - or life."Shouldn't we have hit an obstacle by now?" Dahlia muttered as they took the right fork at another intersection, nerves building with every easy turn. The books she had read to prepare for this mission spoke of the maze as though danger lurked around every corner. So far, three corners and no danger - something she was more suspicious of than comforted by."Don't jinx it," Hermione warned. Dahlia shut up, continuing their hurried pace throughout the maze. They followed the tunnel until it came to an end, another choice to make.They reached the crossroads, slightly out of breath. After examining their bracelets the Gryffindors shared a grimace. "I guess this is where we part," Heroine said softly. Her bracelet was pulling her down the right corridor, while Dahlia's was indicating for her to go straight, deeper into the maze."Guess so," Dahlia agreed, fear sneaking back in at the thought of continuing on her own.Hermione hesitated before gripping her wand and turning to face her tunnel. "Be safe, Dahlia.""You too, Hermione," Dahlia said as she squared her shoulders, and entered her tunnel. It was dark, the light from her wand not offering much visibility. Dahlia stumbled along, keeping her hand on the maze branches as she went. As she walked deeper into the maze the atmospheric temperature seemed to drop until Dahlia was shaking from the cold. Her breath froze in the air around her, a cold chill settling in her bones.Dark thoughts began to jump into Dahlia's mind, memories of how suppressed she had felt trapped in the Room of Requirement. The loneliness, the seclusion, the dark feelings crept back in, dragging her down. Her conversation with Albus raced through her mind, his words about her mother echoing through her head. Her timeline, her parentage, her bloodline... She was an accident... a mistake. She wasn't supposed to have been born. Dahlia closed her eyes, her hands against her head as she sunk to her knees in defeat, the dark thoughts overwhelming her.Dementors.The thought popped into her head, quiet yet sure. Mentally she slapped herself, fighting against the darkness in her mind. Pulling her thoughts together, Dahlia remembered Harry's words. Focus on a happy memory. Desperately she fought against the dark thoughts in her head as she groped around for a happy memory.Draco's face at the Yule Ball as they danced flashed through her head, and she latched onto it. She squeezed her eyes shut, focusing on how happy she had felt that night as they danced, him never once leaving her side. She started to smile as she remembered him pulling her down the hall, and how she'd jumped him in the hallway. The thought of his lips on hers, his arms around her...A small inkling of warmth formed in Dahlia's chest, and she opened her eyes. "Expecto Patronum!"A wisp of white smoke trailed from her wand, and Dahlia focused harder. She thought of Draco's lips on hers, the way he cupped her face and tucked her hair behind her ear. She remembered how he had desperately kissed her before the match as though he couldn't bear to let her go, his words all but demanding her to return to him. Return to him."Expecto... Patronum!"A large graceful swan erupted from the tip of her wand, and soared through the maze, chasing back two large dementors that were blocking the path ahead of her. The light from her swan lit up the maze before her. Dahlia stumbled to her feet, and sprinted through the maze, desperate to get away from the dementors. Her swan flew above her head, knocking three more dementors out of her path. The cloaked creatures scattered, abandoning the maze all together and taking to the skies. The swan continued to follow Dahlia as she raced through the maze, barely noticing which direction she took until the bracelet on her arm burned so hot she cried out.She scanned her surroundings, and saw two figures on the ground ahead of her in the maze. Both were on the ground, one on their stomach, the other covered as if by a cloak.Dahlia felt her heart drop as she sprinted towards the figures, dread filling her. "Harry?"No response. Dahlia slowed her approach, suddenly apprehensive. She called out again, but received no answer. As she approached she could see one of the figures was struggling on the ground, a dark presence covering his body - not a cloak like she originally thought. Dahlia collapsed on the ground next to the person, but as she reached to touch the darkness she found it was a clammy creature. She braced herself and attempted to pull it off, but it was adhered to the person's body and face.Desperately Dahlia pointed her wand at it, trying to think of a spell that wouldn't injure the person under the creature when suddenly her swan patronus soared down from above her, knocking the creature off of the person's body with its wing.Instantly the creature recoiled as if burned, gliding off so fast Dahlia almost thought it was a shadow. Glancing down, Dahlia was shocked to find herself on the ground next to Harry who was gasping for air."Oh, my god, Harry!" Dahlia reached out to help her friend sit up as he desperately inhaled oxygen. "Wh-what happened? What was that?""No idea," Harry rasped, leaning his head against the wall of the maze. His ragged breaths were the only sound between them for several minutes until his breathing slowed to normal. Harry then turned to Dahlia, offering her a sincere nod. "Thanks. You saved my life."Dahlia shrugged, dismissing his words without second thought. "Honestly, I didn't even know it was you."Harry laughed weakly, rubbing his temples. "Thank god you're a good person then." The two shared a brief, sarcastic laugh before Harry turned to regard her curiously. "How'd you know to use your Patronus?""I didn't," Dahlia admitted honestly. "I was trying to think of a spell to use, and I forgot I had already conjured my patronus earlier with the Dementors. She just kinda took it from there.""Oh," was all Harry said as Dahlia pushed to her feet, and offered him a hand. After helping him to his feet, Dahlia glanced around and was shocked to see Fleur Delacour laying on the ground, the second body behind him. "What happened?""Krum hexed her," Harry said grimly, brushing his hands against his pants as he stood. " I saw him do it and went to help her after he had left. That's when that thing came up behind me. Have you seen Hermione?"Dahlia shuddered at his story, unwilling to believe Krum would have done this. She knelt next to Fleur's body, relieved to find it was only an extremely strong Petrifying Charm. "I was with her for a while, but then we had to break off a little bit ago," she answered as Harry started to stumble through the maze ahead of them. "Where's John?"Harry glanced back at her, eyes and face void of emotion. "I haven't seen him."Dahlia pushed aside the moment of fear that swept through her, and continued after Harry. She shot red sparks up in the air above Fleur's body, signaling a removal team to extract her. The two of them ran through the maze, taking tunnels that lead deeper into the heart of the darkness until suddenly a strong wind blew from behind them."Run!" Harry yelled, eyes flying wide in panic, grabbing Dahlia's hand and sprinting towards the end of the tunnel. "We have to move!"Dahlia sprinted with him, fear lacing her chest as they ran all out, arms pumping. "Why?""The maze moves!" Harry gasped as the bush walls around them began to morph and change shapes. They sprinted for their lives as the walls around them began to enclose, until finally they burst through the end of the tunnel, gasping just as the branches solidified. Dahlia watched in shock as the maze morphed itself solid, closing the tunnel they had just been in.Harry picked his glasses up off the ground as they stood, out of breath and shaky. He was cursing under his breath as he turned to look behind him, at Dahlia. She watched the relieved look on his face slide slowly off; his jaw going slack and his eyes wide. Dahlia spun around, anticipating a threat, but was shocked to see the triwizard tournament trophy perched on a stand about a hundred yards away in the middle of a clearing."No fucking way," Dahlia breathed as her and Harry shared a look before sprinting towards it. All thoughts of exhaustion disappeared as they spurred their legs faster towards the TriWizard Cup. They were fifty yards from the trophy when Cedric Diggory stumbled from a tunnel ahead of them, screaming.Dahlia nearly tripped, Cedric's panicked yells startling her. Her and Harry skidded to a halt, approaching the tunnel entrance cautiously when Cedric was blasted back with a flash of red light. Dahlia and Harry ducked instinctively, the curse caster hidden by the tunnel Cedric had emerged from.Dahlia yelled out, holding her wand out before her as Harry approached the entrance to the tunnel Cedric had just left - the spell threw him backwards into the branches of the maze wall. He now lay on the ground near the wall, appearing lifeless. She threw up a protego behind her as a precaution, bending down to see if Cedric remained conscious. Before Harry could turn down the tunnel Victor Krum emerged, wand upheld. A duel ensued between Krum and Harry, with Dahlia throwing hexes when she could without a risk of hitting Harry; Cedric forgotten to the side. Finally Krum was unable to block a disarming spell from Harry, and his wand went flying, landing on the ground ten feet to his left. Harry kept his wand trained on the Durmstrang student as Dahlia rushed over to Cedric again, relieved to find him conscious this time. He was coughing, struggling to his feet as he extinguished flames from his robe, unsteady hands quivering as he gripped his wand."He tried to kill me!" Cedric yelled, brandishing a finger at Krum. Krum's response was to grind his jaw, eyeing his wand on the ground. Dahlia took a few steps forward, kicking the wand into the nearest bush, the maze walls hiding it from sight. Cedric raised his wand to stun Krum, when Dahlia yelled, "Look!"Cedric and Harry whipped around to see a six foot acromantula racing towards them. Cedric turned his wand on it, casting spell after spell towards it while Harry dove out of its way. Dahlia screamed as the large spider crawled the wall over them, avoiding Cedric's spells.Amidst the panic, Victor Krum had recovered his wand and raised it to curse Cedric again. Dahlia raised her wand on instinct, prepared to block the spell, but Harry was faster."No!" Harry bellowed, a large shield erupting from his wand just in time to rebound the spell back at Krum. Krum was rocketed backwards by the force of his own spell, and Cedric turned to give Harry a wide look of surprise."Th-thank you." The Hufflepuff stammered, wand slowly falling to his side."Don't mention it," Harry muttered as the three turned to face the triwizard trophy, still visible in the clearing."Take it," Cedric said abruptly. "You saved me; it would be yours anyways."Harry took Cedrics words in silence, turning to Dahlia and gesturing towards the Trophy. "By that logic, you saved my life so it should be yours."Dahlia looked between the two boys before her, surprised by their generosity. She shook her head. "No. We do this together. Hogwarts wins either way."The boys nodded, all in agreement."Together," Harry agreed and together the three strode up to the small podium holding the Trophy. They looked at it for a short moment before Harry spoke. "On three?""On three," Dahlia and Cedric agreed, looking at Harry for the count."1...2...3!"Harry, Dahlia, and Cedric grabbed hold of the handles on the Trophy simultaneously. They shared a victorious moment, faces breaking into smiles, chest's heaving in relief. A moment later the world turned, twisting inside out, and then everything went dark.The next moment they were falling from the sky, landing with a harsh thud on cold ground. Dahlia lay on the ground for a moment before her eyes fluttered open. She pushed herself up on her elbows, taking in their surroundings.They were in a graveyard. An older graveyard, by the looks of it. She scanned around the horizon, seeing no sign of the Hogwarts castle. It was noticeably colder here - wherever here was, leading her to believe they were no longer on Hogwarts grounds. A cold sense of dread washed over her, and she sat fully upright. Scattered graves of various sizes were around them, some dating as old as the 1800's, but none newer than the 1960's.A cry to her left caught Dahlia's attention. She turned to her right to see Harry doubled over a few yards from her, clutching his forehead, groaning in pain."Harry?" Cedric's voice rang out as he stood up, several yards to Dahlia's left. She swung around to look at him, matching his concern and confusion. "Where are we?"Harry continued to moan, his hand covering his forehead, head shaking back and forth. His green eyes opened and locked on Dahlia. Harry pushed himself to his feet, gripping tombstones as he made his way towards her, using the grave stones to balance himself as he went.He collapsed behind a tombstone about ten feet away from Dahlia. "I've seen this place before," Harry moaned as he glanced around tensely."What?" Dahlia whispered as she got to her knees, preparing to crawl towards him. She stayed low and out of sight on instinct - something was off; this wasn't supposed to happen. Draco's warning flashed through her mind, her stomach clenching. "Where?""My dreams," Harry moaned, crying out as he collapsed onto the ground. "Ah!""Harry..." Cedric's voice held a warning note. Dahlia turned to face him, finding the Hufflepuff boy frozen in place, fear on his face. He was standing, facing something on the other side of the gravestone she was hiding behind. She craned her neck, but couldn't see what Cedric was looking at. She went to glance at Harry, and found him standing up, looking in the same direction as Cedric. The reaction on his face told him something horrible had happened. Harry's face went pale, and then terrified, his entire body tense. The moment of fear was brief, and quickly replaced by panic. He met her gaze out of the corner of his eyes, and covertly shook his head no. Dahlia crouched further down, pressing her back against the tombstone. What had happened?"Stay. Down." Harry breathed at her, not taking his gaze off of whatever Cedric was staring at. The horrible feeling in Dahlia's gut intensified; for once Dahlia listened without question as a squeaky voice rang out, "My Lord, he brought an extra."There was a moment of silence, and then a deep raspy voice spoke, "No matter. Dispose of him.""No!" Harry shouted, and Dahlia saw him start forward. There was a flash of light, and Dahlia heard Cedric shout. A gravestone erupted, and someone yelled another curse. Growling, Dahlia rolled to her right behind the tombstone Harry had been behind previously. She craned her neck to see, and felt the air leave her lungs.Before them in the graveyard about twenty-five yards away was a man, probably forty or fifty years old. Patchy red hair, large front teeth, and wispy beard, the man was strangely rodent-like. He had a strange air about him, but he wasn't what terrified her; it was what he was holding.In his arms, wrapped in black clothes was a thing. Deathly white, it looked like a misformed human adult that was trapped in a child's body. It's head was full size, but not fully developed facially. It's body was small, getting lost in the coverings it was wrapped in. For a moment Dahlia couldn't process what it possibly was, until it spoke."I said dispose of him!" The moment it spoke, Dahlia knew exactly what she was looking at. Lord Voldemort - in the flesh. Or almost flesh. Harry had described Voldemort as being in a half-form before - when they ran into him in the Forbidden Forest. There was dark magic in the air - she could sense it; something evil lurked around the creature in the rags. Something so dark, yet familiar; almost as though her magic recognized his.The hairs on her neck stood up straight as she realized he was ordering his servant to kill Cedric. Her throat tightened as she went to stand up, but Harry's shield charm richoted the spell away from Cedric, who was stumbling backwards away from Voldemort. She ducked below out of sight just in time to see Cedric start to run away, shooting spells over his shoulder."Run, Cedric!" Harry screamed as he shot a spell at the man carrying Voldemort. Cedric didn't hesitate; he stumbled away, ducking behind tombstones as Harry dueled the other wizard.Dahlia's instinct was to help, but she knew it would be no good if they had no way out of here. She turned, desperately glancing around for the TriWizard Trophy that had brought them here. Someone had transfigured the cup into a portkey; if it brought them here it could take them back. Dahlia scanned her surroundings, panic fueling her, but it was nowhere in sight. Before she could continue her search Voldemort's voice rang out again."Enough!" Instantly the sound of spells colliding stopped, the graveyard going quiet. Dahlia dared a glance around the tombstone to find Harry suspended in mid-air, frozen in place. Her heart stopped, body tensing. Albus had always told her how Voldemort wanted to kill Harry - something about a prophecy. Dahlia clenched her wand in her hand, ready to defend Harry should anyone make a move to harm him. She knew her orders - she knew not to interfere, but she'd be damned if she stood by and watched Harry die tonight."Well done, my lord," the rodent man said reverently."Enough talking, wormtail. Just perform the ritual."The rodent man winced under the dark lord's harsh words, but obediently submitted. Harry remained frozen in place, suspended in midair. The rat man summoned a cauldron with a swish of his wand. The cauldron was boiling with a thin purple liquid, strange vapors rising from it.Dahlia stayed frozen in place, unsure of what to do as the man Voldemort had called Wormtail approached Harry who still hung suspended in the air before them. From his robes the rodent man withdrew a small silver knife. Dahlia swallowed nervously, grip on her wand intensifying, preparing to attack. Wormtail reached out, and before Dahlia could react, he slashed it down across Harry's forearm, leaving a deep cut several inches long.Harry's muffled scream shook Dahlia to the core, but she remained in her place. Her body was shaking, but she forced herself to remain hidden. Harry wasn't dead - he wasn't dying. She was his only chance, and she couldn't rush in blindly. She had to get to Harry, but she couldn't now. Silently she coached herself, eyes glued to the situation. Dahlia bided her time, her heart pounding as she watched the scene unfold before her.Wormtail used a canteen to capture Harry's blood, and then turned the Cauldron in front of him. He dropped the blood, canteen and all, into the cauldron. The potion inside hissed and turned black, steam no longer rising from the top.'"It is time, my lord.""Well done, Wormtail. Complete the task."Without another word, Voldemort's servant lifted his small, deformed body and dropped it into the cauldron. Dahlia's eyes grew wide in horror, as the spell holding Harry was released, and he fell to the ground. She watched his body fall to the ground like a rag doll, and for a moment she was scared he was unconscious. Then he was pushing himself to his feet, green eyes angrily flashing, transfixed on the cauldron.The cauldron began to bubble and froth, until the contents of the cauldron levitated themselves into the air. It was horrifying to watch; the remnants of Voldemort's half-body were expanding and contracting as the potion began to work. For several moments nothing happened, and then all at once there was a bright light. When the light cleared, standing on the ground barefoot in the black robes he had once been wrapped in was Lord Voldemort."No!" Harry's voice cried out, sounding defeated. The rush of relief Dahlia felt to see Harry okay was drowned out by the panic that set in at the sight of the Dark Lord, fully in the flesh."Well done, my good and faithful servant," Voldemort purred to the man he called Wormtail, reaching out to caress the man's face like a child's. "Call the others."The rat-like man pulled the sleeve of his left arm up, revealing the Dark Mark. Voldemort latched onto his wrist, and with long, slender fingers touched the Mark directly on the skull. Instantly the man's tattoo began to wiggle and dance.Harry let out an agonizing scream the second Voldemort's finger touched the Dark Mark, clutching his own arm as in in agony. Voldemort watched him silently from several yards away before looking up to the skies expectantly. Less than thirty seconds later Death Eaters began to appear by Voldemort's side, some apparating, other appearing in tunnels of dark smoke.A malicious smile spread across Voldemort's face as his faithful followers appeared; he addressed them all as they solidified in the graveyard, all matching in their death eater robes and masks.."My friends!" Voldemort cried as the tenth and apparently final Death Eater apparated into the graveyard."So it's true?" A man stepped forward, knocking back his cloak as he did. Long dark hair, bold and scarred face with a nose that had been broken time and time again. His face cause a nugget of fear in her; even she recognized the face of Fenrir Greyback. Most feared werewolf in the enter continent. He had a cell in Azkaban with his name on it - Voldemort's blood purist streak extended to creatures, which technically meant werewolves, so Dahlia was surprised to see the man among Voldemort's inner circle."It is true," Voldemort assured his Death Eaters, spinning slowly in a circle to look at each one of them. "I have come back, in the flesh, all thanks to Mr. Potter, here."The cloaked Death Eaters cheered, some whooping in celebration while others guffawed at Harry, who lay on the ground before them, struggling to get back up on his feet. Dahlia tightened the grip on her wand, desperately glancing around the graveyard. She had to get them out of here... but how? Where was the portkey? And where was Cedric?"Dahlia," A faint whisper came from Dahlia's left. She turned, and saw Cedric crouched behind a large monument almost 20 yards away. They locked eyes, Cedric giving her a reassuring nod. It didn't help in the slightest. She turned her attention back to Voldemort and Harry, Voldemort's raised voice jarring her..Voldemort had now turned to where Harry lay on the ground, and was challenging him, sneering taunts at him. "Get up!" The Dark Lord spat at Harry, kicking his wand to him. "Get. Up!"Harry stumbled to his feet, spitting blood as he stood. He gave Voldemort a look of pure hate as he clutched his wand in his hand, blood dripping down his arm."The little Gryffindor... always so brave...." The Dark Lord hissed at Harry. "Even though he knows his story ends here tonight." An evil grin twisted Voldemort's face, and Dahlia felt her ears start to ring. Voldemort lifted his wand, the dark curse on his lips; Dahlia felt the magic change in the air, felt the darkness surge towards Harry."No!" Dahlia screamed, standing up from her hiding spot. Her wand spun, pointing directly at the crowd of people gathered before her, "Bombarda!" A huge fireball rolled from her wand, hitting nearby gravestones and disrupting the gathering. Voldemort and Harry were forced to dodge opposite directions to avoid the explosion, the Death Eaters scattering.The Death Eaters were in a frenzy, throwing curses in each direction. Dahlia ducked back down beneath the tombstone as three Death Eaters turned their attention towards her. Two of the loyal followers went straight to attack Harry, but Voldemort ordered them back. "The boy is mine! Kill the other!"Obediently the Death Eaters veered off from Harry, instead turning their attention to where her fireball had come from. She dared to sneak a peak over the tombstone at the situation beneath her; Dahlia had just enough time to catch sight of Harry dueling Voldemort when a green light flashed past her head so close the wind caught her hair."Fuck!" Dahlia dove down, covering her head as a valley of curses flew over her. She twisted around, craning her neck to see who was on her. There were now four Death Eaters facing her, while Cedric dueled two others. The other four had surrounded Voldemort and Harry, apparently writing the Hogwarts students off as no big threat."Stupefy!" Dahlia jabbed her wand in the direction of a smaller Death Eater. He was thrown back twenty yards, landing against a gravestone. "Expulso!" Another huge explosion erupted from her wand, hitting the ground in front of three Death Eaters. They were thrown back in the mix of fire and force, but Dahlia didn't stop to see if she'd killed them. She hoped she had, though she doubted she could be so lucky, and kept moving. She ducked behind several gravestones as she made her way towards Cedric, seeing him almost overwhelmed by the wizard he was dueling.Dahlia was almost to him - still unable to make out who the Death Eater was that Cedric was figthing. The man wore his death eater cloak with his hood up, hiding his features beneath the shadows. She was almost to Cedric when the hood of one of the death eater fell, revealing a face Dahlia only recognized from wanted posters; Rudolphus Lestrange. The wizard cackled madly as he cast a spell that hit Cedric square in the chest. There was a flash of green light, and instantly, the Hufflepuff's body relaxed, his eyes going blank and his body collapsing on the ground. "No!" Dahlia screamed, brandishing her wand at the Death Eater. The evil man spun around, a smile on his face. Dahlia felt her temper snap, wand twirling into action as she disarmed him."Expelliarmus! Incarcerous!" Dahlia screamed, her voice attracting the attention of the remaining Death Eaters. His wand flew, Rudolphus's arms and legs snapped to his body, his smile melting off as thick ropes appeared and began to bind him. "Cedric!" Dahlia's voice cracked as she screamed at his dead body from where she stood, her wand at Rudolphus's throat threateningly. "Cedric, get up! Get up, Cedric!"Cedric didn't move. Something inside Dahlia snapped, a look of fury and disgust on her face as she slashed her wand at the Death Eater who was maniacally laughing at her screams, "Reducto!"The Death Eater exploded into blood a bright red mist of blood. It coated Dahlia, head to foot, but she paid it no mind. Her heart was pounding; and all she could see was red. She let out a manic scream as she turned around to face the other Death Eaters. The remaining four death eaters were eying her hesitantly. The bravest of the four was lifting his wand, when Voldemort's voice rang out, "It's over!"The Death Eaters spun around to see Harry on the ground, wandless with Voldemort's wand at his throat. Cheers went up from the few remaining Death Eaters while Dahlia choked back sobs. Harry's eyes flickered to hers, and he jerked his head, silently telling her to run."I have beaten the Chosen One," Voldemort shouted as he knelt down next to Harry. "And I can TOUCH HIM!" With that Voldemort placed his hand on Harry's scar, causing Harry to wince and cry out in pain. Dahlia gripped her wand, sliding to the left more, trying to get behind a tombstone."Amazing what one drop of blood can do," Voldemort murmured as he stood, pacing a few steps away from Harry. The Dark Lord observed Harry with a sneer on his face for a moment before pointing his wand, "Crucio!"Harry writhed on the ground, his terrorized shrieks haunting Dahlia's ears. Dahlia watched wide eyed as the Dark Lord continued to torture Harry for a few seconds before standing up and screaming, "No!"A wave of anger so powerful rolled off of Dahlia that she didn't hold back. "Protego!" A large, invisible shield erupted between Voldemort and Harry, breaking the Cruciatus Curse. Harry lay on the ground, unmoving. Dahlia's chest was heaving, slowly realizing that everyone's attention was now on her. Including Voldemort's."Ah...a third guest." Voldemort observed Dahlia curiously. Dahlia met his snake eyes with a defiant glare, stuffing down the terror she felt. The dark magic around him was unlike any she had ever felt before - an evil so vile she felt corrupted just being around him.Dahlia gripped her wand tightly, holding Voldemort's gaze. "Don't touch him," she spat, shuffling to the left more so that she had a clear path to Harry. Harry lay on her left, Cedric's body to her right now, several meters away. The Death Eaters had gathered behind Voldemort, who stood directly in front of Dahlia now, separated only by a few yards and scattered tombstones.The remaining Death Eaters laughed, as though she was nothing more than entertainment for the evening. Voldemort said nothing to her, simply turned away from Dahlia and back to Harry as though she was of no consequence. "Where were we?" Voldemort mused. "Ah, yes. Time to kill you."Voldemort raised his wand, and in one last desperate attempt Dahlia spun to face Harry. His eyes met hers from where he was crouched on the ground. "Harry!" Dahlia screamed, throwing her wand into the air, praying he understood. Harry caught it, turning to face Voldemort just as the Dark Lord cast his spell."Avada Kedavra!""Expelliarmus!"The spells united, and Dahlia turned away, flinching away from the duel. Her mind spun in panic; she had to take care of the remaining Death Eaters. She had to get to Cedric. Dahlia didn't have time to think, she just reacted. A spell came flying at her, one she sensed was of a dark nature. Wandless, Dahlia knew she was bested; she threw her hands up, crying out in fear. As if summoned an invisible shield appeared, blocking the spell from hitting her.What the hell? Dahlia stumbled backwards, glancing at her hands in shock as more spells came flying at her. She ducked behind the nearest tombstone, pointing at the Death Eater approaching her, anger and fear fueling her magic. S purple light flew from her finger, striking the wizard in the chest, deep blood and gashes appearing on his exposed skin. He fell to the ground, groaning as blood continued to seep from him. Dahlia kicked his wand away from his hand, backing fearfully away from the other approaching Death Eaters.The other Death Eaters took a step back, looking fearfully at Dahlia. Dahlia didn't hesitate, magic pooling in her fingertips. She opened the flood gates, released the tides of anger swirling inside of her. She scrambled to her feet, her eyes blazing with fury as she took a threatening step towards Voldemort's followers. "Expelliarmus!" The blast of energy that radiated from her disarmed all four remaining death eaters, the spell rolling over them like a breeze. They stumbled back under the force, floundering around for their wands. Before they could get the chance to reorganize, Dahlia attacked, reacting to her anger. "Bombarda Maxima!" The entire graveyard around them for twenty yards burst into flames instantaneously, tombstones going up as though ignited. The Death Eaters screamed, some apparating away while others ran, putting out flames on their robes as they went.Dahlia stumbled back, feeling as though her magic was depleted, the world becoming edged in black. She tried to make her way towards Harry, who was now encased in a misty bubble with Voldemort. Dahlia didn't have time to ponder what was causing it; behind Harry laid Cedric's body where he had crumpled, still unmoving. And a few yards from him was the TriWizard Trophy.Dahlia stumbled towards Cedric's body, glancing backwards at Harry as she did so. Something was happening; there were foggy shadows moving about in the fog bubble around them. Dahlia didn't have time to stop; she had to get to Cedric, she had to get the portkey.A guttural cry behind her had her stopping in her tracks. Dahlia glanced over her shoulder, slowing her pace, the cry piercing her heart. Harry had broken the spell, and the foggy bubble that had encased him was now surrounding Voldemort, buying them time to escape."Dahlia!" Harry screamed, latching onto her wrist as he pulled her, spurring her to the cup. "Let's go!"The Gryffindors sprinted the last two feet, Dahlia throwing herself on Cedric's body as Harry summoned the Port Key, gripping her arm tightly in one hand as he reached toward the Cup with the other, "Accio Cup!"Dahlia clung to Harry with one arm and Cedric's body with the other, burying her face in Harry's shoulder. The instant the Port key flew into Harry's hand, the world turned upside down again, the only sound being the angry scream of the Dark Lord as they vanished.

It had been four hours. Was the event supposed to take this long? Draco was pacing back and forth underneath the stands, glancing at the clock every two seconds. Something had gone wrong - his gut instinct was telling him something had happened. Fleur and Krum had both been rescued from the maze, but their seconds remained in there. As did both Hogwarts champions.Malfoy's panic was beginning to rise; no message from his mother, and no sign of the third task ending any time soon. He resisted the urge to pop over to Malfoy Manor and see if his mother had heard word, but he knew if he did that he was as good as giving away his true feelings for Dahlia. So, instead, he paced, eyes glued to the clock.A bright light flashed on the ground in front of the entrance to the maze, and suddenly a pile of bodies appeared on the ground in the field. The TriWizard Trophy rolled to the ground, revealing Harry's stricken face, staring at a body on the ground. Malfoy started forward, his eyes on the bundle of people who were immediately flocked by teachers and Ministry personnel. Draco craned his neck, heart pounding as he tried to see if Dahlia was with them. Something was wrong. No one was cheering. Why wasn't anyone cheering? Malfoy's feet propelled him forward, speeding to a sprint. He vaulted over the gate to the field, booking it full pace across from the field towards where Potter had appeared. Where was Dahlia? His heart was pounding as a knot formed in his stomach, legs slowing to a jog.He was almost to the crowd of people now surrounding the champions when a heart-wrenching scream went up from the field - from the pile of bodies that had just appeared. The hair on Draco's neck stood straight up, the pitch of the scream chilling him to the bone. He knew that voice; that was Dahlia."No!" Dahlia's voice rang out, guttural and frantic, "NO, I said DON'T YOU TOUCH HIM!" Dahlia's scream was desperate. Malfoy couldn't help but be relieved at the sound of her voice - at least she was alive. His relief was short-lived as the crowd around him shifted and Malfoy watched in shock as Dahlia's hand reached out to hit Professor McGonagall's hand away from someone on the ground."Back up!" Harry's voice joined the mix, his voice just as desperate as Dahlia's. Dahlia's sobs could be heard, her frantic demands nearing a shout, but Malfoy still couldn't make out what was happening. The sound of her cries fed his need to get to her; he elbowed his way through the growing crowd of ministry wizards and school faculty that were now completely blocking the returning champions from view.Malfoy pried his way to the center of the circle, coming to a dead halt when his eyes took in the sight before him. Dahlia was covered in blood. From head to toe she was blood red. Her hair was coated in it, her clothes were red, she looked as though she had gone swimming in a blood river. Malfoy's throat constricted at the sight of all that blood on her. Please, God, don't let it be her blood. Malfoy found himself silently pleading. Dahlia had thrown herself over the body of the boy that Malfoy now recognized as Cedric Diggory. The hufflepuff lay unmoving, not breathing, and Malfoy knew he was dead. Harry was panickedly repeating the same thing over and over again, "He's back," Potter was stammering. Harry was gripping Dahlia's hand in his, so tight his hand was white. "He's back."Dumbledore appeared, seemingly from nowhere. He took stock of the situation quickly before immediately taking charge. "McGonagall, we cannot do this here. We must move the body... alert his parents." Dumbledore met McGonagall's eyes through her tears, and the Gryffindor head gave a short nod."I'll alert Professor Sprout; she is his head of house." McGonagall gave a wary glance at Dahlia before leaning into the headmaster, "Dahlia won't allow anyone to touch him."Dumbledore nodded understandingly before turning and crouching down next to his ward. Dahlia was breathing heavily, choking on her sobs, still clutching Cedric's robes and crying loudly. "Dahlia," Dumbledore's voice was gentle as he reached out to touch Dahlia's back. The moment his hand touched her Dahlia spun around, her wand in hand.Her breathing was ragged, her eyes wild as she held her wand in Dumbledore's face threateningly. The headmaster didn't flinch, just calmly looked at his ward. "Dahlia," he tried again softly, looking at the wand in her hand. "Dahlia, that's not your wand."The statement seemed to bring some sense of reality back to Dahlia. Her gaze softened, her eyes scanning the wand in her hand before her eyes shot open and she dropped the wand in her hand like it was cursed. "Th-that's Cedric's wand."Dumbledore nodded as if he had already known that. "What happened, Dahlia." It was a command to tell him, not a question. Dahlia took a ragged breath before meeting her guardian's eyes."I-I gave Harry my wand... Voldemort had his." Dahlia's voice was so soft that if Malfoy hadn't been hanging onto every word she said he would have missed it. A cold lace of fear went through him at the Dark Lord's name. At the mention of Harry's wand Dahlia twisted around, noticing that he was no longer beside her.Her eyes flew open as panic set back in, she scrambled to her feet, spinning in a circle, screaming, "Harry? HARRY!" Dahlia spun in a full circle, staggering as she looked for Harry. "Where's Harry?!"Dumbledore rushed to his ward's side, trying to calm her but any attempt he made only made her break down more. Dahlia was shouting for Harry again, and the crowd was beginning to murmur, looking amongst themselves but Potter wasn't anywhere to be seen. Using Dahlia's distraction, McGonagall had begun to attempt to move Cedric's body; Dahlia caught sight as they levitated it above the ground and she let out a shriek.Dahlia's full rage turned on McGonagall, and even the Transfiguration stood silent as Dahlia screamed. "DO NOT TOUCH HIM!" Her voice cracked with emotion, throwing herself towards Cedric's body. Albus caught her in his arms, and restrained her from getting to it, despite her attempts to fight him off. "He-He- WHERE IS HARRY?" Dahlia was sobbing now, still fighting against her guardian's hold. "I- HOW DARE YOU HOLD ME BACK!" Dahlia shrieked at the headmaster, craning her neck around to him. "I KILLED FOR HIM!" Dahlia broke down, her sobs racking through her. She continued to fight against Dumbledore, thrashing around. Her magic was almost crackling in the air around her she was so unhinged.Draco couldn't stand it anymore; he couldn't watch her break like this. He strode forward, ignoring the shake of the head Dumbledore gave him, signaling him to back off. Malfoy disregarded him completing, continuing to keep advancing until he stood a few feet in front of where Dahlia was struggling against her guardian."Dahlia," Malfoy whispered, his voice breaking. At the sound of his voice, Dahlia stilled. Malfoy hesitated, unsure whether that was a good thing or a bad thing, before saying her name again. He'd expected her to attack him, to be angry at him for all the shit he'd said over the last few months but she didn't. She lifted her head, and her eyes met his.It was like the air left his lungs. Her usual glistening eyes were always full of life and joy, occasionally annoyance. Now they were dull, full of tears that tracked down her bloodstained face, leaving muddy rivers down her cheeks. Behind her eyes she looked almost broken; a testament to the horrors she had endured. Her robes hung in tatters, scorch marks running up from the hems, still smoking in places. "Draco..." her voice was hoarse from screaming, rugged and cracked. It took him a second to register her voice, but when he did his eyes flew open. She'd called to him. She'd said his name - his first name. Dumbledore, seeing the calming effect Malfoy was having on his ward, hesitantly released her, and Dahlia stumbled forward and into Draco's arms. Malfoy wrapped his arms around her, not caring that everyone could see them. Or that she was covered in blood. She was breathing and alive, and for now he would take that. Dahlia was shaking with sobs or shock, Draco couldn't tell; she had buried her face in his shoulder, curling her tiny body around him. Malfoy sunk down slightly, gathering her closer to him, tightening his hold on her.Dumbledore watched them cautiously for a moment before looking away from the couple in front of him, his eyes scanning the crowd around them. "Where is Harry?"Malfoy didn't answer him; he had no idea. His only concern was Dahlia."Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore turned to address him, his voice dead serious. Draco jerked his eyes up to the headmaster, listening intently. "Take my daughter to my study. Do not speak to anyone else, do not take any detours. Wait there until I come for you."Draco met the headmaster's eyes and nodded solemnly. "Yes, sir." The headmaster called out other orders as he turned to stride away. Draco turned his attention to the quivering girl in his arms. His heart contracted at the sight of her broken look, the way she clenched his robe into her fists tightly.. "Come on, Dahlia," Draco murmured into her ear soothingly. "Let's get you somewhere safe."Dahlia didn't look up from where she was sobbing into his shoulder. She simply nodded, blood smearing from her hair to his robe. Draco dipped a hand under her knees and scooped her into his arms, ignoring stares and whispering of the students around them. He strode off the field and towards the castle in long steps, talking softly to Dahlia as he went. He murmured encouraging words in her ear, reminding her that he was here and the worst was over.Halfway up to the castle Dahlia's sobs quieted, her breathing slowly becoming more regular. Draco hesitated, knowing she probably didn't want to talk about it, but he needed to know what had happened to her. "Dahlia... Can you tell me what happened?"Dahlia winced, lifting her head for the first time to fully meet his eyes. "Y-you were wrong."Draco looked at the girl in his arms sharply, not understanding. "What?""Th-the death eaters. They didn't want to kill Harry in the maze. The cup was a port key; it took us to some graveyard. V-voldemort was there..." Dahlia started sobbing again, twisting Draco's robes in her hands anxiously. Malfoy sped up, his mind spinning as he barged through the doors to the castle, taking the moving stairs three at a time. She spoke of Voldemort as if he had returned."What else, Dahlia," Draco asked as he took the stairs up to Dumbledore's office two at a time. He barged into the office, immediately setting Dahlia down so she could sit on the desk as he pulled away from her just enough to inspect her. His hands trailed down her arms, searching for any major cuts. She was covered in blood; his hands searched her body for signs of the blood being hers. "Where are you hurt?""I-it's- n-not my b-blood." Dahlia managed out between sobs, shoulder quivering, "I-I killed someone," her words were a whisper, her face a blank expression of numbness. She blankly turned to look at him, her eyes swimming with guilt and despair as she stared at him. Draco couldn't think of an appropriate response; part of him wanted to ask who - a smaller part wanting it to have been his father. A larger part of him wanted to hold her in his arms, and never let her go so he could kiss away her fears and make sure she was never in danger again.Draco settled himself in a chair across from the headmaster's desk, nestling Dahlia on his lap snuggly. She didn't protest, just continued to cling to his neck as he comfortingly rubbed her back. Dahlia pulled back, hiccuping slightly. "He killed Cedric. I watched him kill Cedric, and I got so MAD." Dahlia whispered fearfully, glancing at Draco from the corner of her eye as she confessed."What happened, baby?" Draco didn't care what she had done or who she had killed. She had come back alive. Anything else they could deal with."Rudolphus Lestrange killed Cedric," Dahlia whispered, her voice shaky but void of emotion, face deadly. "I watched it happen. I- I was dueling other death eaters and Harry was dealing with Voldemort... I was making my way to h-help Cedric when Rudolphus's curse hit him." Dahlia's voice broke, and she paused for a moment to choke back a sob. "H-he was dead before he hit the ground. I lost my temper, Draco," Dahlia lowered her gaze, as if ashamed of what she was about to say. "I disarmed Lestrange and then subdued him with an incarcerous. Then I saw Cedric was really dead and I...""And you what?" Draco asked breathlessly. He was grasping at every word she was saying. The Death Eaters had truly attacked her; they hadn't headed his warning. Draco felt a sense of dread overtake him when he realized his father had possibly been one of the Death Eaters who had attacked her. Another sickening jolt when he realized that even Albus Dumbledore's name hadn't been enough to protect Dahlia."I exploded him," Dahlia winced, the truth falling ashamedly from her lips, keeping her eyes trained on the ground.Draco pulled back, staring at the Gryffindor on his lap in amazement. He couldn't find the right words to say for several seconds, shocked into silence. Suddenly, a guffaw erupted from him and he asked incredulously, "Y-you exploded my uncle?"Dahlia spun around on his lap with a horrified look on her face, guilt seeping from every pore. Her hand clapped over her mouth and tears formed in her eyes. "Oh, fuck. Draco," her voice trailed off as she started crying again. "I-I'm sorry...""No!" His words came out more harshly than he meant them to. Draco noticed Dahlia flinch away as if expecting him to push her away after her statement. Instead, Draco gathered her closer to his chest, tucking her head under his chin. "I think it's bloody brilliant."Dahlia snuck a shocked look up at him, only to find him almost smiling down at her. "W-wait, what?"Draco ignored her, dipping his head down to lean his forehead against hers. "You came back alive," he murmured gruffly. "Don't apologize for that. Don't apologize for the people who didn't."Dahlia seemed to process his words for a moment before letting out a relieved sigh and nodded against his forehead. For several moments neither of them moved, content to be close to each other, their hot breaths mixing between them. Dahlia savored the quiet moments in his arms before feet could be heard shuffling outside the office door.Dahlia made to get up, but Draco gripped her tightly to him. She didn't resist, letting him tuck her protectively into his chest as he lifted his wand to the door as it swung open."Harry," Dahlia felt relief sweep through her as her champion stepped into the room from the landing. Draco immediately lowered his wand as Dahlia stood from his lap, throwing her arms around Harry's neck."Dahlia, thank god," Harry breathed, embracing her back, body sagging in relief. Malfoy ignored the nugget of jealousy that took root at Dahlia rushing from his arms to embrace Potter."Where's Dumbledore?" Malfoy asked abruptly, pushing himself to his feet, looking expectantly at Potter as he pulled away from Dahlia.Harry winced, glancing away towards the wall guiltily. "There's a... situation. He told me to come here and he would be here shortly.""A situation?" Dahlia's wide eyes flew to Harry, on guard and suspicious. Her body language changed, shifting from relaxed to tense. Malfoy reached out, placing a hand comfortingly on her shoulder without second thought, some of the tension easing from her posture. "What happened?"Harry slumped down into a chair, exhausted and defeated. "Let's just wait for Dumbledore, okay?" He dropped his head in his hands, massaging his temples. "I'm sorry I didn't help."Dahlia turned to him sharply, cutting him a confused glance. "What do you mean?""The Death Eaters," Harry stared at her blankly. Malfoy stood off to the side, his arms crossed as he watched the interaction before him. "I saw you. Dahlia, you were brilliant."Dahlia winced, turning her back on Harry, eyes falling to the ground. "It was nothing.""You took care of ten death eaters by yourself, Dahlia." Harry whispered, looking at Dahlia with respect. Malfoy stared at Dahlia, walking up to put an arm around her waist from behind. His mind spun, almost in denial at Harry's words."I would be dead if you hadn't been there."Dahlia started shaking in Draco's arms, and he gathered her tightly to him. He would give anything to take her anywhere but here. His mind was reeling; Dahlia had taken care of ten death eaters? Somewhere behind them Harry kept talking, "I wanna know how you did that Bombarda spell after you gave me your wand -""You gave Harry your wand?" Malfoy said accusingly, looking angrily down at Dahlia.She didn't respond, just shrugged numbly. "It worked out.""Here you go, by the way." Harry extended her wand back to her, and she hesitantly took it. She tossed it on the headmaster's desk before leaning back against Malfoy and letting him support her. She nuzzled her face into his neck, closing her eyes to everything else. All that mattered right now was Draco was here, and she was alive. So many questions whizzed around Malfoy's head, but he couldn't bring himself to care enough to ask them.Dumbledore's footsteps could be heard ascending the stairs, and all three students turned to the door as he walked in, looking extremely tired. Malfoy regretfully relinquished his hold on Dahlia as the door swung open, allowing her to take a few steps away from him. He swallowed the sourness that action left behind - dismissing the thought from his mind as the headmaster looked straight at him."Mr. Malfoy, I appreciate you keeping my ward company, but now I must speak to her and Mr. Potter alone."Malfoy growled low in his throat, unhappy with the dismissal. "Professor -"Dumbledore held his hand, silencing any protests. "I assure you Dahlia may find you after we are done speaking; you may even wait outside the door for her if you wish."Draco whisked his gaze between the headmaster and Dahlia's before grunting. "I'll be waiting," Draco murmured into Dahila's ear. She gave a small nod, hand sliding into his to give it a quick squeeze before releasing it. She managed a small smile at his look of encouragement before he turned and strode from the room, door slamming behind him.Dumbledore sunk into the seat behind his desk, gesturing for Harry and Dahlia to take seats as well. Both students did as indicated, sinking into the seats directly across from his desk, waiting for the headmaster to speak."Voldemort has returned," Harry spoke first, his voice full of urgency. "He-""I'm aware, Harry," Dumbledore cut him off gently, giving the Gryffindor an affectionate smile. "Right now, what I need most is to hear your sides of the story, starting the moment you entered the maze."Harry and Dahlia nodded, sharing a look of hesitation. Harry told his story first, up until Dahlia saved him from the creature. Then Dahlia spoke of her entering the maze. Together they told Dumbledore of their fight with Krum, and how the port key had taken them to a graveyard."Why did all three of you take it?" Dumbledore asked, interrupting their story for the first time. "Why not one of you?"Harry looked at Dahlia, who gave Harry a nod to explain. He took a breath before shrugging. "I saved C-cedric's life in the duel with Krum. He offered the Trophy to me because of it."Dumbledore's eyes sparkled with a knowing gleam as he smiled. "And?" he prompted.Harry exhaled, his face tinging pink, "I figured if we were going by that standards, that meant the true winner was Dahlia since she saved my life."Dumbledore's gaze flicked to Dahlia, who hesitantly raised her gaze to meet her guardians."And, Dahlia?" Albus questioned his ward curiously. "What led to all three of you taking the port key?""I didn't complete the other two challenges; it hardly seems fair for me to take the trophy. In the end, it boiled down to a Hogwarts win anyways, so I proposed we all take it together."Dumbledore beamed, observing his ward with a look of love for several quiet moments. Eventually the headmaster turned his attention back to Harry, probing him to continue their original story.Harry continued the story of what happened in the graveyard, how he had tried to occupy Voldemort but Dahlia had been the one to eliminate death eaters. Dahlia sobbed as she spoke of Cedric's death. She withheld speaking of how she had violently murdered Cedric's killer, she simply said she'd killed him and neither Harry nor Albus had pushed her on it."I would be dead without her," Harry admitted, not meeting Dumbledore's eyes. "Dahlia gave me her wand just in time for me to fight Voldemort. And she somehow did magic without a wand," Harry had told the story to Albus, of how Dahlia had continued to fight, giving Harry her wand. Dumbledore's head snapped up at the mention of Dahlia's wandless magic. His blue eyes stared into hers, and she returned his gaze numbly. She knew what he was going to ask before he spoke."It was emotional magic, Albus," Dahlia said softly, hoping her mind was concealed from her guardian tonight. "I-I don't know what happened. I only did three spells."Dumbledore shook his head, and turned his attention to Harry. "Seeing as how Dahlia saved your life tonight, I would like very much to keep it a secret what wandless magic Dahlia has managed to do. Am I understood?" Dumbledore eyed the teens closely, before sighing. "Not a soul must know."Dahlia and Harry nodded, Dumbledore's gaze especially focused on Harry as the boy gave him assurances he would keep the secret. Dumbledore sighed, standing. "Harry, I'm sure you'd like to get to bed after the night you just had. You may go; I'd like to speak to Dahlia alone for a moment."Harry gave a curt nod, looking to Dahlia for reassurance it was okay that he left. When she nodded he pushed to his feet. "I'll be in the common room waiting for you, okay?"Dahlia gave him a node, trying to manage a smile as he stood and took his leave. As soon as the door closed behind him Albus turned to Dahlia, a grave look on his face."You intervened," was all Albus said.Dahlia shot her guardian a nasty look. "And if I hadn't, Harry would be dead. The Prophecy would be over, and Voldemort would be in control right now."Dumbledore was silent, before nodding. "I suppose that is true."Dahlia said nothing back, giving him the cold shoulder as she picked at the blood drying quickly on her skin. She continued to stare at the ground as the headmaster gazed thoughtfully at her in silence."I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask that you intervene again," Dumbledore said softly, shocking Dahlia. Her head shot up to look at the headmaster to find him staring at her intently."What?""The Beauxbatons students are returning to their school, and I need you to go with them."Dahlia stood in outrage, crying out, "No! I just got to Hogwarts! I have -" Dahlia brandished her arms around, shouting angrily, refusing to be sent far away. "I have friends here.""It would only be for a short time. There is something I need you to find, hidden in their castle."Dahlia eyed Dumbledore suspiciously, calming down slightly. "What?"Dumbledore cleared his throat, leaning back in his chair. "Several years ago there was an issue with the Sorcerer's stone; it was hidden here at Hogwarts, and Voldemort tried to steal it.""I remember that," Dahlia said softly, dropping back into the seat across from his desk. "Harry told me about it."Dumbledore nodded as he continued, "Yes, well, after that my dear friend Mr. Nicholas Flammel decided that he would take responsibility for it's safe keeping. He is the headmaster down at Beauxbatons, you see. He promised to destroy it before his death, but I have reason to believe it was never truly destroyed.""You want me to find the stone," Dahlia summarized, shooting her mentor a curious look. "Why do you need it?""I believe Lord Voldemort is going to go looking for it again; and this time there won't be Harry Potter to stop him."Dahlia's face paled as she took a step back. "You're asking me to find this thing before Voldemort does?"Dumbledore nodded, expression serious. "You'll leave with the Beauxbatons students. They remain at school over the summer holidays, so if everything goes accordingly, you could be back in time to rejoin Hogwarts semester in September.""I get this done and you'll bring me back to attend school?" Dahlia needed the headmaster's word he would bring her back - that he wasn't just sending her away as a punishment for getting involved."Yes," Dumbledore agreed solemnly. "However, I cannot bring you back until you have found it. The sooner, the better."Dahlia rolled her eyes, pushing to her feet, giving his a cross look. "I'll be done in time for school.""Excellent, my dear." Dumbledore stood, walking around his desk to embrace his ward. Dahlia allowed the embrace, pulling away to look up at her guardian."Why me, Albus?"Dumbledore sighed, patting her arm lightly. "One day dear, things will become clear."Dahlia rolled her eyes, turning to walk to the door. Her frustration was apparent; his vague responses growing old. "When do I leave?""Tomorrow."

Malfoy wasn't outside the headmaster's study when she left her meeting with Dumbledore. In fact, there was no sign of him in sight the whole time Dahlia numbly made her way back to the Gryffindor common room. She looked for him through the empty corridors, although she saw not a soul on her way back to her common room. Defeated and disappointed, she reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, grumbling the password.As she stepped through the painting the only people still awake and waiting for her was Harry, Hermione, and Ron. All three started at her arrival through the portrait hole, Hermione and Ron taking in her bloody appearance up close for the first time."Dahlia..." Hermione's horrified whispered brought Dahlia's attention to her appearance. Blankly Dahlia looked down to see she was covered in blood from head to toe, the thick liquid sticking to every spare inch of skin. Her tournament robes were singed from her fire spells, hanging in tatters in some places, heavy with blood."Bloody hell..." Ron seemed at loss for words as he surveyed Dahlia's appearance. She avoided glancing in the mirror that hung above the fireplace, certain her appearance was disturbing. Dahlia didn't speak, just lifted her head to meet her friend's watery stares with a blank one of her own. Hermione reacted first, rushing forward to embrace Dahlia."I'm so glad you're okay," Hermione breathed as Dahlia numbly lifted her hands to rest on her friend's back. Hermione paid no mind to the blood transferring onto her clothes, the sticky way Dahlia's robes clung to her even after the witch pulled away."Wh-what happened in the maze?" Ron asked, looking between his fellow Gryffindors somberly."I told them about the graveyard," Harry explained to Dahlia, noticing her sharp look at the mention of the third task. "The gist of it, anyways."Dahlia nodded again, blankly looking around. She found that she didn't even have the energy to talk now; she was physically and mentally drained. Now that she had noticed, she could feel the dried blood in every pore of her skin. It was soaked into her hair, so that her hair stuck together in odd places in clumps. If she wiggled her toes she could even feel blood swishing in between them, her shoes full of it. She was covered in blood, blood she had spilled. Dahlia shuddered, suddenly feeling disgusting."Do you want to get clean?" Hermione asked hesitantly. Dahlia met her eyes, gratefully nodding. Hermione rose, gesturing for Dahlia to follow her.Harry sent Hermione a concerned glance as Dahlia wordlessly followed Hermione towards the girls bathroom. Hermione offered Harry a comforting smile before taking Dahlia's arm and leading her away.Malfoy still hadn't been seen by breakfast the next morning. After Hermione had helped wash away every last remnant of blood from her body and hair Dahlia had wandered around the castle, specifically the dungeons in search of a certain Slytherin boy. She longed for him - for his comfort. With her departure for Beauxbatons hanging imminently over her head she was desperate to find him - to tell him where she would be and why she might not be in touch over the next several weeks.She prowled the castle, top to bottom to no avail. Either Malfoy had taken shelter, hiding in the Slytherin common room, or he had vanished. When the sun could be seen peeking over the horizon Dahlia finally called it quits, dragging her exhausted body up to Gryffindor Tower.Maybe Draco was actually upset about her murdering his uncle. What else could explain his sudden disappearance? Defeated, Dahlia had returned to her dormitory and packed her trunk for her mission at Beauxbatons.Now Dahlia sat in the Great Hall for breakfast, picking absentmindedly at the food on her plate. She was decidedly ignoring the glances and whispers she was receiving. Harry plunked his plate of food down next to her, growling at a group of Ravenclaws who were walking past their seats for the third time, whispering and pointing at Dahlia and Harry."Oh, fuck off," Harry snarled at them, sending them scampering off. Dahlia sent him a grateful glance before returning her attention to her food, content to ignore the outside world"Did you get any sleep?" Harry mumbled at her, cutting a glance at her from the corner of his eye.Dahlia shook her head. "No, I didn't even bother to try."Harry snorted, sarcastic and angry. "Yeah, don't bother. It's just nightmares." The dark circles under his eyes said he was speaking the truth."Great," Dahlia said sarcastically. Harry didn't pursue the conversation further. They picked at their food in silence, not raising their gazes above their plates until a pair of footsteps came to a stop behind them.A boy cleared his throat, and Dahlia half turned in her seat to find Cedric's second standing expectantly behind them. Dahlia rolled her eyes, turning her attention back to her food. She was in no mood to deal with his shit today."What do you want?" Harry asked cooly, stepping in to address him when Dahlia refused."I want to know what happened to Cedric," the Hufflepuff demanded, lofty and superior.The entire Dining Hall stilled, all eyes on Harry and Dahlia. The Gryffindor table was on edge, everyone's eyes flitting between her and Harry, to the Hufflepuff, watching how they were going to react. Dahlia clenched her fork in her fist, glancing over at Harry to find an equally furious look on his face."You were in the maze," Harry retorted quickly, venemously. "You saw for yourself."A look of almost shame flashed across the other boy's face, but he covered it quickly. "I mean after the maze. Before you and Dahlia showed up clutching his dead body."Harry ground his teeth as he responded coldly, "Well, you can wait until Dumbledore addresses the entire school about it."Cedric's second slammed his fist down on the table, his face scrunched into anger. "No, I want to know NOW! From you!"Harry growled back, pushing backwards from the table so he could get to his feet. "Dahlia and I met with the headmaster last night," Harry snarled, jabbing his finger in the Hufflepuff boy's chest threateningly. "I don't give a rats ass about what you want. Dumbledore will address the school all at once so Dahlia and I don't have to continue reliving the worst moments of our lives." Harry ended in a yell, dominantly leering over the Hufflepuff boy in silent challenge.Cedric's second cursed under his breath, but turned and scampered back to the Hufflepuff table. Harry roughly sat down, cursing under his breath. "Are you okay?"Dahlia couldn't speak through the emotions clogging her throat. She nodded quickly instead, blinking rapidly to remove evidence of the tears from her eyes. Harry looked at her closely, but didn't say anything as he returned to silently brooding."Did you hear they're going to skip exams for everyone under fifth year and send them home?" Hermione arrived, completely oblivious to the tension at the Gryffindor table. She almost sounded disappointed by the exams being cancelled, taking a seat next to Harry with a depressed air."Only you would be disappointed about cancelled exams, Hermione." Harry grumbled, shaking his head mournfully at the clever witch.Dahlia drowned out their conversation as she searched the Slytherin table again for any sign of Draco, but none could be seen. Her eyes spotted his group of friends, all laughing merrily. It was as if he had just vanished, never having been here at all. If she hadn't been so numb to emotion, Dahlia probably would have been panicking.Dahlia had refrained from telling her friends she was leaving; Dumbledore hadn't told her not to speak of her mission, but she knew her guardian well enough to know this was something he would want to be kept confidential. Hopefully she would be back in time for school to start September 1st, and her friends wouldn't need to be any wiser of her whereabouts over their extended summer.Breakfast came to an end, with Dumbledore announcing the departure of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students immediately following the morning meal. Dahlia hastily excused herself from the Gryffindor table, hoping to leave before her friends noticed she was missing.Dahlia fled the Dining Hall after Dumbledore's announcement. She scanned the Slytherin table one last time, but Malfoy was still missing. Dahlia stomached her disappointment and rising panic, turning and heading to the carriages. If Draco didn't wish to speak to her, he didn't have to. And she couldn't blame him.Malfoy was waiting impatiently outside of Dumbledore's office for Dahlia's meeting with the headmaster to end. He'd tried to eavesdrop, but the headmaster must have a Muffliato charm protecting his study. No voices could be heard from inside the closed door so Draco waited instead, tapping his feet and fingers as the seconds painfully ticked by. He busied himself by using his wand to clean the blood off of his clothing and body. He siphoned it off skillfully, only cutting his robe in two places. He had just finished tidying himself up when he heard someone ascending the stairs."Ah, Mr. Malfoy," the cold voice of the potion's master could be heard as he strode up the stairs. Draco looked expectantly at his head of house, pushing to his feet."Are you waiting for a meeting with Dumbledore?" Snape's voice was always snide.Malfoy shook his head no, and was opening his mouth to explain further when Snape cut him off."Good. Follow me. You have been summoned home." Snape spoke curtly, gesturing for Draco to follow him as he descended the stairs.Draco started to protest, "Professor, I can-""Your mother's message was urgent," Snape interrupted impatiently, pointing to the stairs as though Draco was a child. "She demands your presence at you manor immediately."Draco ran a tired hand over his face before growling, "Fine." He stomped impatiently after Snape. His mother would not take kindly to his declining her offer to return him - it certainly seemed Snape wouldn't either. Defeatedly he took the stairs down two at a time; the sooner this was over with the sooner he could get back to Dahlia.Malfoy followed Snape through the corridors to his office in the dungeons. Snape didn't say anything else the entire time, cloak floating ominously behind him. Once they arrived at his office the potion's professor strode behind his desk and began searching through drawers. Finally he withdrew a small bag, and after sniffing the contents, offered it to Malfoy. "I assume you've used the Floo Network before, Mr. Malfoy?"Draco huffed, striding forward to take a pinch of the powder in the bag. He was a pureblood; he'd grown up using Floo Powder. "Of course.""Good," Snape said curtly, stepping aside so Draco could walk past him to the fireplace. Draco crouched down, stepping into the fireplace, not wasting another minute discussing foolish things with his professor. "Malfoy Manor!" Draco shouted, dropping the floo powder. Instantly a giant emerald flame roared to life, and he was sucked downwards in the violent flame.Draco stepped into his family's sitting room a few seconds later. He lazily dusted himself off as he strode through the room, straightening his hair and clothes as he called for his mother. When he received no response he opened the door to the sitting room and called throughout the quiet house, "Mother?"Draco had always hated Malfoy Manor. It was his childhood home, but it was the furthest thing from a home possible. It was large; probably half the size of Hogwarts. Most rooms hadn't been entered in years, locked and warded closed. His family only habited two of the twelve wings in the castle - the only two wings where all dark magic had been expunged. Generations of dark objects and magic were hidden in the house by his ancestors, something his father was quite proud of. It was always dark in Malfoy Manor as though sunlight despised the Manor itself; consequently it was usually chilly inside, the damp walls chilling the air.."Draco!" His mother's urgent voice came from the kitchen downstairs. Draco followed her voice, concern fueling his movements, taking the stairs down two at a time, calling as he approached the kitchen door, "What was so urgent you summoned me here in the middle of the night?"Draco pushed open the door to his kitchen, and was stunned speechless by the state of disarray. The usually tidy kitchen was typically inhabited by one or two of the house-elves, but today it was empty except for his family. Pots and pans were thrown around, scattered on the floor and counters. Plates had been shattered to pieces on the floor, jagged glass pieces laying across the marble floors. The far wall had black scorch marks running up the wall as if someone had set fire to it. Standing in the middle of the chaos, dramatically sobbing on her knees was his Aunt Bellatrix."Wh...What happened?" Draco stood in shock, glancing from his aunt to his mother. Narcissa Malfoy stood next to her husband who was slouched on a stool. Lucius Malfoy looked burnt to a crisp. His robes were in tatters, still smoking at the ends. The skin on his neck and face was irritated, small blisters appearing in some spots."Rudolphus is dead!" Bellatrix screamed, whirling around to face him. Her usual wild appearance was doubled by the grief that was written on her face. Her hair stuck out at odd angles as if she had tried to pull it out, tears staining her face.Draco swallowed nervously at his aunt's words, panic building deep down. He hadn't considered the consequences of Dahlia killing his uncle - his family's revengeful tactics. Malfoy's face visibly paled, realizing what danger Dahlia had put herself in. His Aunt Bellatrix was notoriously mentally unbalanced. Her love for death and violence was topped only by the Dark Lord's. Fifteen years in Azkaban had clearly taken a toll on her emotional and mental well being. Belltrix had always been unhinged, even on her good days. Now, fueled by grief and anger, Draco knew his aunt would stop at nothing to get revenge for her husband's death."H-how?" was all Draco managed to get out. He directed his question at his mother - the calmest in the room - but it was Bellatrix who responded. He had to play coy, unknowing if he wanted to keep his relationship with Dahlia hidden."He was exploded!" Bellatrix wailed, throwing herself on the ground, wailing in despair. "My husband..." her voice trailed off into sobs. Malfoy observed his aunt's despair, his father's smoking robes. He tried to contain a smile as he thought of Potter's words in Dumbledore's office. "I want to know how you did that Bombarda Maxima spell after you gave me your wand." Upon reflection, Draco realized the weight of Potter's words. Dahlia had blown up the "graveyard" they were at, and she had done it after she had given Potter her wand. That could only mean she had gotten a wand from one of the Death Eaters - not an unlikely scenario, or she did it wandless.But no one could perform wandless magic like that. Draco had been top of his class - wrestling with Hermione Granger over first place for every bloody class- but he still couldn't do more than summon an apple without his wand.Draco exchanged a wary glance with his mother. Bellatrix's dramatics had escalated to tears, causing Malfoy a moment of confusion. Bellatrix was not one for waterworks. Draco decided to try to turn the conversation away from his dead uncle, instead directing a question at his father. "And what happened to you?""Nearly exploded," Lucius spat bitterly. "Stupid Dumbledore girl set the whole place on fire."Draco felt the corners of his mouth perk up, despite the overwhelming worry inside him. Dahlia had really done a number on the Death Eaters. Something that felt suspiciously like pride swelled in him, but it was quickly extinguished by the reality that they would now be looking for her, and she had placed herself on their radar. More than just placed herself on their radar - made herself a threat. Draco crossed his arms, leaning lazily against the wall as he attempted to appear unbothered, fighting against the fear pooling in his chest. "So, is this why I've been summoned? To watch the aftermath a fourth year Hogwarts student rained on the Dark Lord's inner circle?""There's been a death in the family, you idiot!" Bellatrix turned on him, snarling aggressively, staggering to her feet.Draco gave her a cool look. "Maybe in your family."Bellatrix's eyes flew open wide. She raised her wand until it was pointed at his throat. Bellatrix was shaking, but Draco just looked at her, his eyebrows raised in silent challenge. His aunt wouldn't touch him with his mother in the room."What did you say?" Bellatrix rasped.Draco rolled his eyes, leaning forward until the tip of her wand was touching his throat. "I won't pretend that there's any love lost between me and Rudolphus." Especially when he tried to hurt Dahlia. "I am sorry for you, however, Aunt Bellatrix." That was the best he could do without sounding insincere. He hadn't realized until three minutes ago that his Aunt Bella had emotions for anyone outside of herself.Bellatrix seemed to weigh his words for a few long seconds before lowering her wand and stepping away. Her dark eyes glared at him threateningly, reminding him that she would not soon forget his words."What happened anyways?" Draco curiously asked, turning away from his aunt to face his parents. He hadn't even gotten to hear Dahlia's side of the story before he had been whisked to the Manor."The Dark Lord's returned," Lucius's voice held a note of reverence, of victory. Bellatrix cackled madly, spinning to look at her brother-in-law, sharing in his triumph. The Death Eaters shared a crazed, victorious look."Wh-what?" Draco had hoped Dahlia had been panicked and over thinking when she said the dark lord had returned."The Dark Lord has risen," Bellatrix chanted gleefully behind Draco. "My husband died bringing about the return of the Dark Lord.""No," Lucius cut off Bellatrix coldly, snarling at her. "Your husband died because of an underaged BRAT." He fixed his sister-in-law with a cool stare, rolling his eyes in disgust. "Your husband was incapable of disposing of a simple teenage girl.""Disposing?" The words were out of Draco's mouth before he could stop them. He looked between his aunt and his father, incredulous. They were truly going to kill Dahlia? Even knowing she was Dumbledore's ward?Lucius waved Draco's words away as he continued to address Bellatrix. "Your husband was incapable of defending himself against a witch who has not even completed her O.W.L.'s."Draco stared at his father, his anger boiling just under the surface. "Did you not get my message about Potter's second?"Lucius didn't even glance at his son. "We know Potter's second was Dumbledore's ward."Draco had to turn his back to his father in an effort to conceal his rage. He bent down and began picking up broken glass pieces on the ground to cover as he tried to calm his anger. A few seconds ticked by before Draco found the words to say. "So you summoned me here because despite my warnings, you chose to take action against Dumbledore's ward and now someone's dead." Draco turned around, throwing the glass in the sink and he attempted to mask the anger in his voice."Dumbledore's ward did this?" Bellatrix's voice was deadly quiet. Instantly, Malfoy realized his mistake. He'd given Bella the name of her husband's murderer, and now she would stop at nothing until Dahlia was dead.Draco snapped at his aunt, all patience gone. "Honestly, Bellatrix, if Rudolphus had listened to my warning beforehand he might still be alive.""How DARE you!" Bellatrix gasped, "Rudolphus -""-underestimated Dumbledore's ward," Draco finished her sentence. He met his father's eyes, haughty and cold. "You all did.""The boy's right," Lucius mused, glancing curiously at his son. Draco broke their eye contact, turning to his insane aunt."I will KILL THAT BITCH!" Bellatrix roared, her wand brandishing through the air, more plates and cups shattering as her wand twirled through the air, blasting the cabinets. "I WILL AVENGE RUDOLPHUS."Draco closed his eyes, trying to shut out the panic that was rising. Dahlia has a price on her head now, and Bellatrix always gets her prey."I will speak to the Dark Lord myself about getting revenge. Certainly he won't deny me; I have been his most faithful-""Oh, you've been the most faithful?" Lucius let out a sarcastic laugh. "That's why your husband was summoned to the graveyard with the rest of the inner circle, yet you remained behind?""YOU DARE-""Yes, Bella, I dare," Lucius sounded bored, almost disgusted with his sister-in-law's actions. "Your revenge shall have to wait until after the funeral at least."Draco was truly bored with this conversation, and he was itching to return to Hogwarts. He needed to see Dahlia and tell her of the target on her back. He needed to warn her. "So," Malfoy drawled, appearing bored, "surely you don't need me to stick around to referee a shouting match.""Of course not," Narcissa snapped, getting cross with him for the first time. "A death is a time for families to come together; for comfort and help plan the service."Draco laughed sarcastically, his head thrown back. "We are hardly a family, Mother." Draco turned to walk out, but couldn't resist one last dig at his aunt. "As for the service, might I recommend a closed casket?"Bellatrix's infuriated scream echoed down the hallway after him.Draco hadn't been permitted to return to Hogwarts that night. He wasn't even allowed to return the next morning. His mother had insisted he remain at the Manor until his uncle's service, two days from his arrival. It was a small ceremony, only close friends and family attended. Apparently they were telling the story that he had died while on a mission in Europe, because being killed by a fifteen year old witch was shameful, apparently.Malfoy resented being stuck with his family in this miserable, dark house. He was itching to return to Hogwarts, both to escape his parents and see Dahlia. The past two days had been uneventful; he'd been locked in his room the majority of the time. Bellatrix moped around the house, and his mother continued as if nothing had happened. His father was gone a lot, for which Draco was thankful for. He didn't think he would last much longer in the Manor if his father came home.He had been questioned extensively by his parents. They'd pried into his life at Hogwarts, asking questions about Dumbledore's ward. He expected such, knowing that Dahlia posed a threat and his parents would act accordingly. He had anticipated how thorough their interrogations would be, how unforgiving and unrelenting. Malfoy was now facing the third interrogation by his parents who were convinced he knew more than he was letting on."I already spoke to you about this," Draco spoke in a bored tone, giving his father a cold stare. He checked his mental wards, thankful for his mother's lessons in occlumency as a child. "I wasn't there in the graveyard; you were. What could I possibly give you that you don't already know?""You came to warn us of Potter's second," Lucius spoke softly, but his voice carried a deadly weight. "Why would you come to warn us if you hadn't known how powerful she was?"The steadily increasing panic in Draco had reached astronomical levels. For days he had holed up in his room, going over the story he was to feed his parents. He was desperate to return to Hogwarts to check on Dahlia, desperate to escape the tension in the Manor. She was probably furious with him; he'd told her he'd be waiting for her and now it was nearly three days later. She'd already cursed at him for being hot and then cold once before; he didn't want to see her reaction this time. Malfoy scowled - damn his parents."No," Draco turned his attention back to his father. His voice was shaking with anger, ringing with clarity. "I came to warn you due to the repercussions ALBUS DUMBLEDORE would rain on you for attacking his ward." He fixed his parents with a stern look. "I don't fraternize with the headmaster's brat; you raised me better than that. So, if it's information on her you desire I can't help you." His lips curled upwards in a sneer. The truth of his words weighed heavily with his father, who nodded and dismissed him.His parents said nothing as he turned and strode towards the door. "I'll be at Hogwarts should anyone require my presence for another family emergency," Draco spat over his shoulder, not breaking his pace."Actually, darling," Narcissa's voice rang out. "Hogwarts owled last night; they're sending all students under fifth year home a few weeks early, in light of the... incident. Since you're already here Professor Snape assured us he would send your things no later than the end of today."Malfoy ground his teeth, curses escaping his lips regardless. "Perfect." He turned and stormed from the sitting room. He slammed the door to his room shut so hard the only picture on the wall fell.Draco swore loudly, throwing books across the room. He needed to go back to Hogwarts; Dahlia needed him to go back to Hogwarts. He paced his room restlessly, trying to think of any excuse to go back to school. Dahlia's face kept floating through his mind; how traumatized and blood covered she'd been. Malfoy cursed himself for leaving the office when the headmaster had asked. Cursed himself for telling Snape he wasn't waiting for an audience with the headmaster - maybe he would still be there if he had.Desperation rose in him, his throat becoming tight. Malfoy threw himself down on his bed, staring up at the ceiling as he suppressed the tears that threatened to overflow. He hadn't gotten to say goodbye - he hadn't even gotten to kiss her. Their summer break was now extended an extra four weeks, so it would be close to four months before he would get to see her.Desperation clawed at Draco's throat. Four months. She would hate him by the end of those four months. She probably hated him now for always pushing her away and then chasing after her - she probably thinks he abandoned her again. Draco let out a defeated sigh, slouching down onto his bed as he accepted his miserable fate for the summer.

"All aboard! Train departure in five minutes!" A programmed voice spoke over the speakers. Draco swiftly stooped and kissed his mother's cheek, excitement causing his heart to beat erratically. After four long months, he was finally returning to Hogwarts - to Dahlia. His mother gave him a quick squeeze before releasing him. Malfoy made to walk away without saying goodbye to his father, but his father's cane hit his stomach as he turned to walk away, stopping him. Draco winced, slowly turning back around to face his father.Lucius Malfoy was not one for public displays of affection, of any kind. He wasn't even the kind for displays of affection, so Draco was taken back when his father reached out and pulled him into a stiff embrace. Awkwardly, Draco brought his hands up to rest on his father's back when his father hissed in his ear, "You'd do well to continue to stay away from the Dumbledore girl."Ice cold dread shivered down Malfoy's spine like a piece of ice. His fathers words were more than a warning - they were a threat. Malfoy swallowed, his throat suddenly extremely dry. Immediately his father pulled away, and Draco turned away. Numbly he walked away, his trunk clicking behind him. Malfoy pushed his way through the sea of students saying their tearful goodbyes after their extended summer.While the other students seemed reluctant to leave their families for school, Malfoy was eager to board the train. He'd rather be at school than with his family. Summer at Malfoy manor had been stressful; death eater activity had accelerated over the summer and Malfoy Manor had become a hot spot for meetings. He didn't know specifics, but he was certain that something was going on. His father had spent a generous portion of the summer away with the Dark Lord, only returning to see Draco off to school and occasionally on weekends.Draco kept his eyes peeled for Dahlia, his eagerness to see her now dimmed by his father's warning, but present nonetheless. In the end it didn't matter because he saw no sight of her. He hadn't heard from her at all all summer - no letter, no message, nothing. Not that he was surprised, considering he hadn't written to her. It was too dangerous to write to her; Bellatrix was still in a fury over her husband, ranting about all the gruesome ways she would make Rudolphus's murderer pay.In return to Draco not writing, Dahlia hadn't written to him. A repeat of their Christmas holiday in fourth year, he thought bitterly. He took a little comfort in the fact that Dahlia was most likely with her band of Gryffindors. After the tournament Potter wouldn't have let her sit alone all summer at Hogwarts, so he assumed she was probably at the Burrow with the Weasleys and Potter whenever he thought of her.And he'd thought of her a lot. Thoughts of her plagued his mind, awake and asleep. His family had questioned him several times over the summer about her, putting him even more on edge. He didn't understand why they were so interested in her; except for her unfortunate involvement in the maze, she posed no threat to them. He'd tried to put her from his mind, hoping that if he did so would the Death Eaters.Things were changing around the wizarding world, and people were starting to whisper, despite the Daily Prophet reporting that Dumbledore was lying. People were beginning to mysteriously disappear, like they had almost sixteen years ago when Voldemort first rose to power. Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter were having a standoff with the press about Voldemort's return. Cornelius Fudge - the idiotic minister of magic - refused to believe them, which Draco found quite stupid.Malfoy himself knew that the Dark Lord had returned. He'd heard the word's from Dahlia's own mouth the night of the tournament, and if her word wasn't enough he'd seen nothing but the evidence since then. He'd even had the pleasure of laying eyes on the Dark Wizard himself, must to his chagrin. He'd spent the majority of his summer locked in his room after that, per his parent's command. His parents had seemed almost nervous. That in and of itself put Draco on edge.He'd confronted his mother and asked what was going on, but all she would say was that his father had been given a very important task by the Dark Lord. Any further attempt to get information from her resulted in her walking away, insisting that he was too young to be involved. He'd then dedicated his summer to eavesdropping on their meetings to collect whatever bits of information he could.Draco was pulled from his thoughts when he stumbled into an empty compartment on the train. He threw his bag on the rack before slumping down into the seat dejectedly. The train horn sounded as the car jerked forward, the train leaving the station. He'd barely relaxed before the compartment door was thrown open and Pansy Parkinson stood at the door, with Blaise and Goyle behind her."Here you are, Draco," she said with a twisted smile as they shuffled into the car. She already wore her Hogwarts robes, the Slytherin tie proudly displayed around her neck. "How was your summer?"Malfoy managed not to roll his eyes as he answered her indifferently, "Uneventful." Pansy had been at his Manor periodically over the summer. Her father, while not considered a member of the Dark Lord's inner circle, was a well renown death eater.She was the last person he wanted to see on their return to Hogwarts. Due to her father's involvement with the Dark Lord, she too had spent a great deal of time at Malfoy Manor over the summer. Pansy had formed an... attachment to him. Entirely his fault, he would admit, but unreciprocated nonetheless. Especially after their one evening together a few weeks ago. She now continued to irk him to no end, her mere presence sending him into a fury.Goyle and Blaise sat closest to Draco, leaving Parkinson across from him. He took minimal comfort in that, shifting to glance at Zabini as he spoke. "Did you hear Potter almost got expelled?"Malfoy sneered, trying to appear nonchalant, though his interest was piqued. Dahlia seemed to get dragged into whatever shit Potter got himself into; did that mean she had been expelled as well? His stomach twisted at that thought - is that why Dahlia wasn't on the train? Had she been expelled? Was it even possible for the Headmaster ward to get expelled? "Oh? What'd he do this time?" He forced his voice to remain indifferent, even as he waited desperately for the answer"Improper use of magic in front of a muggle," Blaise said as he opened a chocolate frog, unwrapping it and shoving it into his mouth before it could hop away. "It got dismissed.""Really?" Leave it to Potter to always get in trouble over stupid crap."Yeah, there was a hearing and everything." Pansy added eagerly, her attentive gaze fastened on him. Malfoy didn't spare her a glance, knowing that playing into her would only encourage the behavior more."Interesting," Malfoy sounded bored at this point, his eyes flitting to the window where the countryside was flying by. He tapped his leg impatiently; the thought of Dahlia having been expelled took root deep, concern now aiding his nervousness. "I'm going for a walk."With that he stood and exited the compartment, leaving his friends glancing confusedly between themselves. Malfoy roamed the hall up and down, waltzing through various train cars until he heard Potter's voice from a compartment nearby. He paused outside the compartment for a moment before sliding the door open.Inside sat Harry, Ron, Hermione, the Weasley twins, and Luna Lovegood. All turned expectantly towards their unannounced visitor, surprise written on their faces. The Weasley's all held a certain disdain for him - a feeling he reciprocated."Malfoy," Ron said cooly, eying the Slytherin boy sourly. Draco smirked at him, eyes scanning the compartment once more.His heart dropped when he realized Dahlia wasn't in the compartment. Draco glanced at Potter, meeting the boy's suspicious gaze. "Surprised you weren't expelled, Potter.""It was self defense," Potter snapped back, glaring at him. "What do you want, Malfoy?""Is Dahlia not with you?" Malfoy looked expectantly around the compartment as though he didn't already know she wasn't here. He held his breath, waiting for their answer."No," Hermione regarded him with curiosity, a knowing eyebrow cocked at him. She seemed less suspicious than the Weasley's, although he supposed she had been at the tournament. She'd been the one to point him out to Dahlia on the starting line, after all. A woman's intuition, he supposed."Haven't heard from her all summer, actually," One of the twins chimed in, eying the Slytherin apprehensively. Draco's head cocked to look at the red-head, temper barely under control. One of the twins was always attached to Dahlia's hip, fawning over her like a love-sick puppy.Ron elbowed his brother not discretely, causing the twin to glare at him and retaliate by kicking his shin."She wasn't with you guys over the summer?" Malfoy looked between the Weasley boys in confusion, irritation rising. If Dahlia hadn't been with them, where had she been?"Did you not hear from her this summer?" Harry asked Malfoy, a crease developing in his forehead as he pondered the predicament."No, I didn't. Why would I have heard from her, Potter?" Draco snapped, his face a mask of disdain. He glared at Harry accusingly, arms folded across his chest as he waited for the Gryffindor's reply."...Right..." Harry gave Malfoy a strange look as he turned back to his fellow Gryffindors, concern wrinkling his brow. "So, wait, has no one heard from Dahlia at all?"Every shook their heads slowly, and Malfoy felt his heart settle around his stomach. He wasn't expecting Dahlia to write to him, especially since he had left her alone the night of the tournament. But it wasn't like her to not communicate with her fellow housemates over the summer. It wasn't like her to be the one disappearing."And no one found that odd?" Malfoy growled, locking eyes with Potter as his hands clenched into fists. "First you pick her to die, and then you ditch her after she saves your ass? Way to go, Potter."With that Malfoy slammed the door to the compartment shut, and stomped back to his Slytherin car. He burst open into the compartment, throwing himself down on the seat next to Pansy."The hell happened to you, mate?" Blaise regarded him curiously, almost apprehensively."Nothing," Draco snapped, leaning his head back against the wall of the train. Dahlia wasn't on the train, and no one had heard from her all summer. His mind was jumping to dark places, but he tried to calm himself. He would have heard if the Death Eaters had captured her - surely that was something that would have been mentioned during one of the many meetings he spied on. Dahlia was Dumbledore's ward; she lived at Hogwarts over the summers. She was most likely already at the castle waiting for the students to arrive.That thought placated his anxiety temporarily, and Malfoy closed his eyes hoping sleep would whisk him away from his darkening thoughts.Dahlia wasn't at dinner. Malfoy triple checked the Gryffindor table, and she was nowhere to be found. Malfoy had tried to focus on the sorting, but halfway through Harry's eyes met his. The Gryffindor shook his head, confirming Draco's worry. Dahlia isn't here.After that, Draco focused on nothing. He didn't hear the headmaster's speech, or the announcement of the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He was solely focused on where Dahlia could have been. He knew he'd messed up by not being outside the office after the tournament, but he hadn't wanted to leave her there.Draco was so caught up in his own head that he didn't hear a moment of the new professors speech until the Great Hall erupted into whispers."Wait, what's happening?" Draco asked Blaise beside him, jerking out of his reverie."She's the new DA professor," Blaise jerked his head at a tiny woman wrapped in horrid pink clothes standing at Dumbledore's podium. "Ministry witch.""The ministry is sending someone to Hogwarts?" Malfoy and Blaise shared a look. That couldn't be good; the Ministry hadn't been involved at Hogwarts in centuries."Can't be any worse than the werewolf third year, right?" Pansy sneered.Draco rolled his eyes, and turned back to his food. He schooled his face to remain neutral, but his heart was pounding. He'd known Dahlia would be upset, but not come back to Hogwarts? Anger started building in Malfoy, desperation fueling his emotions. She was always accusing him of running away, and now she did it? She'd run away then, rather than just face him. Rather than give him a chance to explain himself. He snorted, shoveling his fork into his food for the first time. Fine, then. If this is how she wanted it.A month and a half went by, no sign or sight of Dahlia. Draco did his best to push her from his mind, focusing on moving on. Thoughts of her still plagued his thoughts, the focus of his dreams. His father had taken to writing letters, inquiring on Dahlia, but he had nothing to report back. He knew Potter and his band of Gryffindors had been searching for her endlessly, even approaching Dumbledore to no avail. Dahlia hadn't been heard from since the night of the tournament. Draco had come to terms with it - she was gone, and it was better this way. Or so he told himself as he forced himself to get through every day."Oi! Malfoy!" Potter was calling after him, chasing him down in the hallway. Malfoy paused, turning to scowl at the Gryffindor boy running after him. Pansy was walking with him to their Transfiguration class, and she too turned with a sneer at Potter's voice. He'd learned to stop pushing Pansy away - turns out, he didn't have as many people on his side as he thought. Pansy company was trying, to say the least, but beneficial when he needed her."What d'you want, Potter?" Malfoy asked disdainfully as Potter came to a stop in front of him. The Gryffindor was winded, panting heavily as he surveyed the Slytherin boy.Harry glanced back and forth between Malfoy and Pansy. "Can I talk to you?""Isn't that what you're doing now?" Malfoy retorted coldly, shouldering his bag."I mean alone," Harry said, looking pointedly at Pansy.Malfoy turned to her and jerked his head, signaling her to leave. The Slytherin girl huffed, but obeyed without a word regardless, tossing her straight dark hair over her shoulder. She turned on her heel and strode away down the corridor, disappearing around the corner. Malfoy watched her walk away, waiting until she had turned the corner before turning back to Harry. "What?""Have you heard from Dahlia?" Harry got straight to the point.Malfoy snorted. This again. They were still trying to find her when she clearly didn't want to be found. "No, I haven't. Not since the night of the tournament."Harry's eyes widened in alarm, the gears in his mind spinning as he mumbled, "Yeah, that seems to be the running story."Malfoy did a double take, squinting into Harry's eyes. Did Harry mean to say that literally no one had seen her since the night of the tournament? That had been nearly six months ago now; surely someone had seen her before leaving Hogwarts. "What do you mean?""Dumbledore spoke to us after he kicked you out. Then he kicked me out to speak to Dahlia alone. She came back to the common room for a bit, and then disappeared for the rest of the night. I saw her the next morning at breakfast, but that was the last time." Harry glanced around. Finding no one within earshot he leaned into the Slytherin boy, whispering as though sharing a secret "It's been nearly two months since school started. You really haven't heard from her?"Malfoy leaned away from Harry, looking at the Gryffindor with mildly disguised hate. "I already told you; I haven't heard from her.""Are you really going to do that?" Harry asked, disgusted. "Are you really going to pretend that you didn't do everything you could to protect her last year? Like you didn't care for her?"Malfoy gave a sardonic laugh. "Yes, well, clearly she didn't return the feelings. It's been six months, Potter. Do I seem like the type to wait around once I've been burned?"Harry looked at him, a mixture of disgust and disappointment on his face. "So, it's true then? You and Pansy are a thing?"Malfoy shrugged, not put off by Harry's revolting glare. "If sex is a thing."Harry shook his head at the Slytherin, fury burning in his green eyes, face twisted into a sneer. "I thought for a second there was a decent person buried deep inside you, but I was wrong. You're a pig. I'm going to find her, and when I do, stay the fuck away from her."Malfoy's anger sparked inside him. He opened his mouth to respond, but Potter had already turned and was striding down the corridor. Draco snapped his mouth shut, turning to walk the opposite way, jaw clenched shut. Malfoy furiously pushed his homework away, rubbing his eyes. He paced around his dorm room restlessly. It was nearly Christmas Holidays - less than a month left in the first semester. His parents had been hounding him like crazy. They had ordered him to keep his distance from the Dumbledore girl when he had left for school, but when he had returned and they had caught word - his mistake - that she had not returned to Hogwarts for her fifth year they had ordered Draco to discover whatever he could about her whereabouts.At least once a week he would receive a letter from his father asking questions about Dumbledore's ward. At first the letters filled Draco's stomach with dread, but eventually that had just begun to make him sick. They were filled with the same thing - demands about her personal life, where she could have gone, when she was expected to return. None of which Draco had any answers to. Dahlia had left, and Malfoy didn't dare tell them it was most likely because he'd left her alone after she'd murdered his uncle. Even that hadn't been by choice, Draco thought snidely to himself as he continued to pace across his dorm room.After many weeks of desperate thoughts and half-assed plans, Draco had reached the conclusion that wherever Dahlia was, the death eaters had no idea where she was, so it was best she stayed away. She'd run from him, and as infuriated as that made him, he had no choice but to accept it. He'd turned his focus to moving on, as he was sure she had after his apparent abandonment.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"Harry!" Hermione's hushed whispered carried further than she meant it to. Harry glanced at her curiously, raising his eyebrows in silent questioning.Hermione scurried across the library towards him, a letter gripped in her hand. "Harry!"Harry regarded his friend curiously. The closer she got the more panicked she looked. Her cheeks were rosy, and she was gasping for air as though she had run a long distance. Her hair was tangled and half wet with snow. Her eyes were bright, and in her hand she was clutching a letter.Harry stood up in alarm, crossing towards her so that they met in the middle of the aisle. "Hermione, what is it?""This!" Hermione brandished the unopened letter at him. She was gasping for air and seemed unable to speak. Her eyes were lit up with excitement, the energy radiating from her jumpy and nervous.Harry glanced at her curiously as he took the letter from her hand, turning it over to read who it was addressed to. "Hermione Granger," Harry read. The words were sloppily written as though written in a hurry. He looked back to his fellow Gryffindor who was still catching her breath, not understanding her urgency. "What is it?""That's... Dahlia's handwriting!" Hermione gasped, locking eyes with him. Harry's jaw dropped open, heart stopping. He wasted no time ripping the letter open, decimating the envelope it was wrapped in.. Inside, scrawled on a tiny piece of paper were the words:"Hermione, Need help. Please inform the Headmaster I need to be brought back to Hogwarts.Tell him the mission is competed."Harry read the note quietly out loud, him and Hermione digesting it in silence. Hermione ripped the note from his hand to scan it quickly herself. Then she looked back up at Harry, urgency oozing from her. "Well? What are you waiting for? Let's go!"Hermione grabbed Harry's hand and spurred him forward, bolting through the library doors. The two Gryffindors ripped through the halls of Hogwarts on their way to the headmaster's office. Just outside the gargoyle to the Headmaster's study Harry collided with someone, sending both of them sprawling."Oi! Watch where you're going, Potter!" Malfoy spat as he got up from the ground, glaring at the Gryffindor."S-sorry!" Harry yelled as he got to his feet, still running to catch up with Hermione. Harry didn't give Malfoy a second glance, not even as the Slytherin yelled insults at his retreating back."Chocolate Frogs!" Harry yelled the password at the gargoyle, not pausing as him and Hermione took the steps up to the Headmaster's study. They barged in unannounced, startling Professor Dumbledore who was seated behind his desk."What is it?" Albus rose to his feet, looking between the two winded Gryffindors with alarm. Hermione didn't say a word, just brandished the letter at him, chest heaving. Dumbledore took the letter with a wary look at the two students before him. He read the letter several times before striding around his desk."Nicholas, I need you to arrange a pick up for my ward immediately." Dumbledore spoke to one of the pictures on the wall Hermione recognized as Nicholas Flammel. The man in the painting wordlessly stood and waddled out of frame. Dumbledore turned back to the Gryffindors before him, his face settled into grim resignation. "I assume you want an explanation?""Yes, sir," Hermione said respectfully while Harry glared at the headmaster. His face was beat red, body shaking in uncharacteristic anger. Hermione glanced sideways at him, warningly, almost alarmingly."All semester I've been asking you where she's been, and you've known this whole time?" Harry accused the headmaster angrily, pointing angrily at the old wizardDumbledore raised his hand, attempting to placate the boy. "Harry, I-""No," Harry cried angrily, hand slamming down onto the headmaster's desk. "You've been avoiding me all semester! It's nearly Christmas holiday. Dahlia's been missing for months, and I asked you! And you knew where she was and you let me look for her!"Dumbledore regarded Harry with a sad look, a small beacon of admiration shining in his eyes. "I assumed you would have faith that I would ensure my ward's safety no matter where she was.""Oh, like you did in the maze?" Harry spat, sneering at Dumbledore. Hermione gaped at Harry, amazed by his boldness. Dumbledore said nothing, just mouth settling into a grim line."The maze was-""A NIGHTMARE!" Harry bellowed, slamming his fist on the table again, ignoring how the trinkets and book shook. "You weren't there! You don't keep DREAMING about it! Waking up with your scar hurting, feeling like you ARE VOLDEMORT!"Dumbledore seemed taken back by Harry's anger, but recovered quickly. "Harry, I sent Dahlia away. Yes, I will admit to that. However, I did not tell her she had to keep it a secret. If she chose not to tell you where she was going and why then that was her choice, and I will suggest you ask her."The picture that Dumbledore had asked to arrange pick up for Dahlia waddled back into his frame. "Everything is ready, headmaster. You may leave at your leisure.""Thank you, Nicholas." Dumbledore spoke calmly. He then gestured towards the door, which magically swung open. He turned back to Harry and Hermione, "I'm going to have to ask that you leave now. I will send Dahlia down to the Gryffindor common room as soon as she and I have spoken."Harry opened his mouth as though to protest, but Hermione spoke first. "Thank you, headmaster." She tugged on Harry's arm as she made her way towards the door. Harry glared at Albus, but allowed her to pull him from the study, the door slamming magically shut behind themDahlia stepped out of the fireplace, dusting her singed robes off. She sniffled, her nose wrinkling against the itch. Floo powder always made her sneeze. Funny how the itch of Floo Powder caused such discomfort after the hell of the last few months. Beauxbatons was very different from Hogwarts, with a castle that had secrets almost as deep as her own school's. It had been difficult enough to fit in at Beauxbatons, and even more so to try to unravel the secrets around the Sorcerer's Stone. It was several weeks before Dahlia had any sort of friendship at the school, finding even then many carried resentments for the tournament.Fleur had been a fast friend, immediately coming to Dahlia's defense, declaring it was her who saved her life in the maze by shooting the red sparks. The open disgust had lessened after that, although the cruel pranks never stopped. Fleur introduced her to a healer after one particularly rough night, someone who quickly became a close friend. Dahlia had learned to trust no one at that school, except for her healer and Fleur. The Dark Lord's reach was far, extending into even Beauxbatons walls. A few weeks into her mission she had been cornered by the French Death Eaters, three in all. They were new recruits, having recently taken the mark. One of which Dahlia had considered a friend, up until he'd been revealed. Images flashed through her mind, remnants of a duel, his dead body lying on the ground. She shuddered, shaking her head as though to dislodge the memory.The last few months hadn't been kind to Dahlia. The death of Cedric hadn't been kind, so neither had her coping habits. She kept reliving the night of the graveyard over and over again, awake and asleep. Her nightmares were the worst; she would either relive the graveyard and see Cedric, or dream of Beauxbatons. Neither provided much sleep. Interestingly enough, it had been nightmares of her own making that kept her up the most at Beauxbatons - one foul prank and she no longer felt safe closing her eyes in that school, which led to her enlisting the help of a healer friend. After becoming close friends with her healer, he proposed running certain tests to try to trace Dahlia's parentage, which led to a... frightening discovery."I've been trying to bring you back for almost three months now, Dahlia." A deep voice behind her rumbled. "What happened?" Her guardian asked as he stepped out of the fireplace behind her, brushing soot off his shoulder.Dahlia whipped around, glaring at him as she crossed her arms, scowling darkly "I was looking for answers I can't find here. Is there something you want to tell me of my heritage, Albus?"Dumbledore looked blankly at her, stopping dead in his tracks. "What do-""What do I mean?" Dahlia interrupted, her voice practically seething, unfolding her arms to clench her hands into fists at her sides. "Let me rephrase: did you ever run the Blood Magic Test on me?"Dumbledore's gaze lowered, exhaling noisily. "Ah.""Yes, 'ah'." Dahlia snapped at him. She stormed across the study until she was directly in front of her guardian, toe to toe with him. She shook a finger threateningly up at him, her voice rising to a scream. "You mean to tell me you knew? All this time? And you didn't tell me!""I didn't want to burd-""Oh, shut it!" Dahlia snapped, turning her back to Albus. "I asked you if you knew anything about my father, and you said no."Dumbledore sighed deeply, moving so he could collapse in the seat behind his desk. He rubbed his temples tiredly, "I will answer whatever questions you might have; I just ask that you answer one of mine."Dahlia cocked her head at him, a silent invitation to ask her question before she decided. The anger radiating off of her was evident, her amber eyes flashing dangerously as she glared at her guardian."Did you go through St. Mungo's to get the test?"Dahlia snorted, incredulous. "That's your one question? You're one concern?" She rolled her eyes, turning to give her guardian a snide glance. "No, there is a Beauxbatons student who's an ingenious healer. I asked him if he wanted to practice on me, and he agreed. That's when I discovered-""-that your magic traces back to both noble Gryffindor and Slytherin heritages." Dumbledore finished knowingly, look up to meet her gaze."If by a descendent of Voldemort then yes," Dahlia spat, meeting Albus's eye in challenge. She stormed up to his desk, and slammed her fists down on the table, shaking it. "You KNEW Lord Voldemort had a child and YOU KNEW I was one of the -""One of the only good things to ever come from the Dark Lord?" Dumbledore finished quietly, meeting her gaze with a misty one of his own. His words silenced Dahlia, and she looked at him blankly, caught off guard. Her guardian gestured for her to sit, and she did so numbly."Dahlia, as far as I was ever able to tell, you are distantly descended from Voldemort." Dumbledore conjured up two cups of tea as he spoke. "The Blood Magic Test does not match you perfectly; it examines your magical signature and attempts to match it to other signatures until it finds a match. If there is no exact match, it will give you the most compatible options." Dumbledore peered down his spectacles at his seething ward. "I'm assuming you were an exact match to the Peverells?""Yes...""And how compatible were you to Tom Riddle?"Dahlia snapped her head up, eyes wide in shock. "You know his actual name?""Of course I know his name, Dahlia, he was a student of mine long ago.""But...wh-""Now is not the time, my dear. How compatible were you to the Riddle house?"Dahlia grumbled her response. Dumbledore raised his brows at her, and Dahlia rolled her eyes before speaking louder. "It was a high compatibility between the magic signatures."'Dumbledore clenched his jaw, but nodded. "Precisely. All that indicates is that you are descended from him. He is the last of his name, seeing as how his mother died in childbirth, and he murdered the rest of his family.""That means somewhere down the line...""Voldemort has a child." Dumbledore finished, waiting patiently as Dahlia processed this information. She was stunned silent, worst suspicions confirmed. Her face paled, turning an almost sickly shade of green."What does this mean?" She whispered, her eyes wide, wild in denial. "Does he know I exist?"Dumbledore hesitated, before shaking his head slowly. "I do not know much; I'm afraid a situation like that has never happened before. I doubt he knows of your parentage - after the graveyard, I can quite comfortably say he knows you as my ward. I do know this; you cannot intervene in the affairs between Harry and Lord Voldemort at all."Dahlia's head jerked up, her mouth dropping open, hackles rising at his words. "Wait - Are you saying I can't help Harry?"Dumbledore shook his head, leaning closer over his desk towards Dahlia. "I'm saying you can't do anything that would tip the scales one way or the other. Your existence here has seemingly caused no ill effects thus far, but the affairs between Harry and Voldemort have been building for decades, and it must not be affected. His prophecy must unfold as it was Seen."Dahlia pulled back, gaping at her guardian. Her mouth opened and closed as she tried to form words - to protest, refuse to stand by and watch, yet no sound came."This must unfold the way it was meant to, Dahlia." Dumbledore murmured, his gaze apologetic, his voice firm. "I'm sorry this will be difficult for you, but you cannot intervene.""No," Dahlia shook her head firmly, denying his words, pushing out of the chair to pace back and forth across the study. "That's not fair. I should get a choice. I should get to fight!"""This is how you fight," Dumbledore said gently, observing her nervous pacing.Dahlia fought against the tears that were beginning to brim, stopping dead in her tracks to shake her head violently. "I-I can't.""You must," Dumbledore pushed, leaning forward to catch her eye. "You're timeline... it's-""I'm not supposed to exist here, so I can't intervene. I got it." Dahlia snapped at her guardian, straightening and pushing herself away from the desk. She dashed her hand under her eyes, erasing proof of the tears that glistened there. Spinning on her heel, she strode towards the door,d determined to leave before she burst into tears."Dahlia!" Dumbledore called as she neared the door. She paused, not turning around as she waited for him to finish, fighting the tears that pooled in her eyes, the emotion clogging her throat."Did you find it?"Dahlia paused, grinding her jaw as she chose her words, inhaling to get a grip on her emotions. Her mind scattered, jerking back to her original mission that sent her into this hell. "Yes," She finally spoke, her words clipped and short, thrown over her shoulder. "But there are many enchantments, and I'm not convinced it's the entire stone."Dumbledore waited patiently for her to finish, and when she didn't he probed her for more. "And?""And I left the only two people I trust there undoing the enchantments. They will let me know when it is finished."Dumbledore nodded, not entirely convinced, but dropping the subject nonetheless. "Very well."Dahlia took her dismissal as she strode towards the door, stopping to turn on her way out. She turned to hatedly glare at her guardian, fire snapping in her amber eyes. "This makes no difference; you knew about my heritage and you should have told me. If not years ago, then at the very least nine months ago when you told me about my mother and I asked."Dahlia strode on her heel and walked out. Blindly she brushed tears out of her eyes as she fled down the steps and past the gargoyle. She navigated the corridors of Hogwarts at a jog, not stopping to embrace the familiarity that surrounded her. Dahlia was in too big of a hurry to get to the Gryffindor common room that she didn't realize she had stumbled down an abandoned corridor that was occupied.She stuttered to a halt. To her utter dismay, before her was Draco Malfoy. His back was to her, so he hadn't seen her yet. But she saw him - she would recognize his outline, his silver hair, his cut of his shoulders anywhere, even after months away. He was taller now - several inches taller, well muscled. The sight of him, even the back of him, distracted her so much she didn't notice at first glance that he had a girl pushed up against the wall. For a moment Dahlia was confused as to what was happening until she took in the ragged breaths and moans, the sweaty heaves. Her eyes wandered over the pair, taking in the girl's scrunched up skirt around her waist. Malfoy was grunting as he thrusted into the girl, bracing himself on the wall with one hand while the other was wrapped around the girl's waist.A strangled sound left Dahlia's throat, eyes widening with horrific realization, hand slapping over her mouth in an attempt to muscle her cry. Malfoy must have heard because he whirled around, not bothering to cover himself, shock and fear written across his features.Whoever he was expecting to see standing in the hallway, it was not her.His eyes flew open wide, and a strangled sound left his throat. His arms dropped weakly to his sides, jaw dropping in surprise. Their eyes met, and everything froze for a moment. His eyes were wide with shock and surprise, her own wet with despair and betrayal. She looked away first, her gaze turning to his body. She could see his chest heaving from his recent exercise. He ran a troubled hand through his pale hair, glancing back at the girl still concealed behind him as her gaze turned hard, flickering back up to his eyes. Finally his gaze turned back to hers, this time fury simmering in them. She saw the despair buried in his glance, but paid it no mind, his anger fueling her own."Well?" He snapped at her, gesturing around them as though nothing had happened. "What are you looking at?"Dahlia stood in shock for a second before recovering. She gave him a momentary once over, lingering for half a second of his well endowed body part. She gave a casual shrug before meeting Malfoy's simmering gaze. "Not much, honestly." She managed a sneer even he would have to appreciate.Dahlia didn't stay to watch the shock register across the Slytherin boy's face, or how his cheeks flushed red in embarrassment as he quickly covered himself.No, she turned immediately and fled the scene. She broke out into sobs as her feet carried her up the moving stairs to Gryffindor tower.

Malfoy stared at Dahlia's retreating back. He was still reeling from seeing her standing in front of him. Of all the people he'd thought would be standing behind him in that hallway, Dahlia had been last on the list. His first thought had been that it was Pansy standing behind him - the hell she would release if she knew he'd been sleeping around. His second thought was Minerva McGonagall, just as terrifying as the first option. Dahlia hadn't even been on his radar - not even a hope in the back of his mind, yet there she'd been - standing right behind him. His first reaction had been shock, as had hers apparently. Then immediately after he felt what was almost... shame. He'd almost forgotten Daphne was behind him until she moved, causing him to look away first. He cast an almost guilty look behind him, turning back to Dahlia just in time to see recognition click in her eyes.The brief look of betrayal that flashed across her face enraged him, or perhaps it was the shame at reuniting this way. Anger flooded his mind regardless, at himself mostly, but he directed it at her. He resisted the urge to snarl at her - she had left for months! How dare she get to look betrayed by his actions?!Almost as soon as he thought it he felt the guilt crawling into the pits of his mind, but the anger couldn't be dismissed. Instead he had verbally attacked her, rudely trying to play off the situation. His reaction was expected. Typical, even. He was a Malfoy, after all. What was one to expect?Her reaction, however... her reaction was what left him staring after her, hastily zipping up his pants. She'd never been one to take his shit, but she'd never been one to return his snide remarks. Granted, he'd never thought their reunion would be with him pulling his dick out of another woman. Dahlia decidedly handled it better than Pansy would have.The thought of Pansy made his stomach drop, wincing to himself as he tightened the belt on his pants. He replayed Dahlia's face in his head; she'd even managed to mimic his trademark sneer. And dare he say, she wore it almost better than he did.Draco let out a frustrated sigh, running his hand over the back of his neck as he tucked his shirt back into his pants. This was not how this was supposed to go. She was supposed to stay away."We better go," Malfoy said harshly to the Slytherin girl behind him. Daphne was straightening her clothes, looking him to give him a wide-eyed nod."We can go back to my dorm?" She offered with a coy smile, offering him her hand."No," Malfoy said bluntly, buttoning his shirt as he turned to leave. "I'm no longer in the mood."He left his fellow Slytherin standing there, slightly agape as he strode down the corridor Dahlia had taken.Dahlia had managed to get her tears under control by the time she stumbled into the Gryffindor common room. True to his word, Harry was waiting up for her. He leaned against the mantle, staring into the fire. A brief glance around the room showed she had a small audience awaiting her arrival - all Weasleys were present, plus Hermione. All eyes turned immediately to her as the portrait burst open and she stepped into the room.Immediately she was engulfed in a six person hug, limbs and hair going in all odd places while a chorus of voices chanted her name. Dahlia smiled despite her despair, wrapping her arms around the closest bodies to her and clinging to them.A strangled sob escaped her throat as she soaked in the comfort and warmth surrounding her. She hadn't realized how lonely had felt these last few months at Beauxbatons without her friends. The weight of her mission with Dumbledore, the events of Beauxbatons, along with her discoveries about her heritage had left her alone and miserable. Add the shock of seeing Draco's dick for the first time as he pulled it out of another girl and her mental state shattered.Not that she'd thought of his dick at all in the past seven months. Or any part of his body. After the first few months of basking in his disappearance, she'd forced any thought of him from her mind. He always left - always.Slowly the loud cheers and rounds of "I missed you!" came to an end and the hug broke away, pulling Dahlia back to the present with it. Dahlia wiped her happy tears away as she looked at the beaming faces around her. Fred and George stood towards the back, high fiving and hugging each other. Ron and Harry were clapping each other on the backs, grinning broadly, while Hermione and Ginny remained attached to Dahlia's sides, chattering excitedly."I missed you guys so much!" Dahlia gushed, spinning in a circle as she took them all in."You missed so much!" Hermione squealed as she hugged her friend again. Dahlia laughed, embracing her friend back, blinking back the tears that sprung into her eyes."Where were you?" Ron blurted, his ears turning pink when Ginny immediately hissed at him, "Tactful, Ron!""Sorry!" He mumbled, wincing away from her threatening finger. Hermione led her to a chair, everyone propping themselves against eh closet couch back or table as they encircled her, waiting for her story."It's okay," Dahlia giggled at the display of sibling affection, smiling fondly at her friends. "I was at Beauxbatons.""On assignment for Dumbledore?" Hermione whispered, just low enough for her and Harry to hear. Dahlia managed a barely perceptible nod as Ron's eyebrows shot up."Blimey! You've been with all the french girls?" He looked jealous, earning him an evil eye from Hermione."Oh yeah," Dahlia winked at him, wiggling her eyebrows suggestively. "I spent a lot of time with your future sister-in-law; turns out she and I knew each other more intimately than one would have thought."Ron's face instantly became befuddled as he exchanged confused glances with both of the twins. Dahlia bit her lip, realizing her words might be premature. It appears the Weasley's didn't stay in touch with their oldest brother as much as she'd assumed."What d'ya mean?" The twins asked simultaneously, leaning in towards her as though they were sharing a secret."If you don't know I can't be the one to tell you," Dahlia said with a wink as she turned back to Harry and Hermione, desperate to escape that conversation. "How've you been?" She added on a more serious note to Harry. She'd been having muddled dreams, flashing scenes of strange people, Voldemort's face wafting in and out of view. She saw a prophecy, and the dark mark, on several occasions, each dream sensing as though Harry was near.She'd hoped it was just her over-active imagination; her body rejecting sleep, but one look at Harry told her he hadn't been sleeping well either. His answer only confirmed her suspicions more.Harry shrugged, not quite meeting her eyes as he shuffled his feet. "I've been fine."Dahlia focused on Harry, giving him a bemused look, trying not to push him, but seeing through his lie. "Right. You just look like you haven't slept in weeks for fun."Harry's brow perked as he frowned at her. He rubbed his face and shrugged, dropping down on a chair as he met her gaze for the first time. "You don't look much better."Dahlia shut up after that - hard to argue with the truth. She tilted her head, nodding to him as she offered him a weak smile, maybe as encouragement that everything would be fine, or maybe just to placate him. Either way, it did the job because he smiled back, looking at her intently. "So what did Dumbledore send you all the way to Beauxbatons for?"Dahlia shrugged, glancing around the room hesitantly. The Weasley's were listening eagerly. Dahlia bit her lip, uncertain if she wanted to expose her mission entirely. Unsure if she was ready to explain the depths of the truths she'd uncovered there. "I don't really think it's something I'm supposed to be discussing.""Why didn't you tell us?" Hermione asked softly, not meeting Dahlia's eyes as she spoke. Her voice was full of hurt, eyes deflecting sourly.Dahlia hesitated, glancing over to where her friend sat looking at her hands. Dahlia sighed defeatedly, leaning forward to take Hermione's hand in her own. "I didn't want anyone else to die," she said honestly, turning her gaze to pinpoint Harry and Ron. "I didn't know what I was getting into and I needed to just do it alone."Harry met her gaze, his eyes hard. He swallowed several times before jerking his gaze away. "You could have at least written," he accused bitterly."I...I didn't know what to say," Dahlia said softly, wincing at his harsh tone. "I watched Cedric die; I killed someone, Harry. And then I had a mission to do and I just wanted to... get lost in the mission. I wanted to focus on anything other than what had happened that awful night."Harry was silent as he watched her passionate speech. He didn't look at her for several long seconds before he looked up, giving her a jerky nod. His eyes met her with some level of understanding, at least enough to drop the subject. "I-I can get that."Dahlia let out a sigh of relief as she looked around the room to the other people who were intently eavesdropping on their conversation. Dahlia met each one's eyes individually as she spoke. "I'm sorry I didn't tell anyone what was going on," she said softly, sincerely. "That wasn't fair to you guys."Ginny and Hermione accepted her apology with tearful nods and smiles. The twins gave her goofy grins and smiled compassionately at her. Ron simply gave a single nod, while Harry simply looked at her, managing a small smile. They sat in silence for a moment, content to be reunited until Hermione broke the silence."I think maybe we should all get to bed," Hermione offered quietly. "It's late and we have classes tomorrow.""Right," Ron said offhandedly as the group began to scatter, the boys heading up the stairs to their dormitory. Dahlia lingered until it was just her and the twins in the common room. George started up the stairs to the boy's dormitories but Fred hung back, stopping to look at Dahlia."Are you not going to bed?""Can't sleep," Dahlia said immediately, turning to give Fred a small smile. She had settled into an armchair by the fair, feet tucked under her legs. Sleep as a luxury she no longer had; her nightmares saw to that.Fred turned back to face her fully, the stairs to the dormitory momentarily forgotten. "Want company?"Dahlia hesitated, considering just telling the boy to leave her be with her dark thoughts. But the thought of being left alone with her dark thoughts was more uncomfortable than forced company so she smiled at Fred instead. "You like getting into trouble?"Fred seemed taken back by her answer, but a mischievous glint appeared in his eye. "What do you have in mind?"Dahlia pulled a small baggy from her robes and offered it to her red-headed friend. The twin accepted the little baggy eagerly, lifting it up to his nose. He inhaled deeply before turning to her wide eyed. "That's some gas!"Dahlia giggled, looking at him in shock. "You know what it is?" Beauxbatons had opened her eyes to all sorts of new Muggle things; she hadn't expected the pureblood weasleys to know what it was as she had only learned the past few months herself."I've had my fair share of excursions with the muggle boys around our house," Fred said knowingly. He glanced around the common room to ensure they were alone before shoving her baggie back at her. "Here - hold this. I'll be right back!" He turned and disappeared quickly up the stairs behind them.Dahlia stood where he left her, curious as to what he could possibly be getting before he pounded back down the stairs, George in towe."Sorry," Fred gestured to his brother who had a look of pure delight on his face. "When my brother heard you had muggle weed he couldn't resist.""More the merrier," Dahlia said with a smile as the boys followed her to the portrait hole. "Where to?"The twins grinned and shared a look. "We have a couple spots we could show you.""Miss Dumbledore!" McGonagall's voice rang out across the breakfast table. Dahlia and the twins had passed out in the astronomy tower last night after attempting to smoke four joints in ten minutes between them. Dahlia giggled as she remembered the brief snippets of conversations before the three of them had slump together in a small pile. It had been nice to spend time with friends, a chance to cast aside her worries for a few hours. It was a feeling of normality, even a few hours of blissful sleep as they slumped over, using each other as pillows.They'd stayed there all night too until Fred had awoken her this morning. The three of them were now sitting around the Gryffindor table, looking like hell. None had had time to brush their hair or change their clothes; they had fled immediately upon waking to the Dining Hall for breakfast."Yes, Professor?" Dahlia was attempting to improve her slightly wild appearance. Her hands were smoothing her hair and simultaneously trying to straighten her wrinkled clothes under Minerva's scrutinizing gaze.McGonagall looked disapprovingly at Dahlia's disheveled appearance. She said nothing about it, however, as she brandished a piece of paper at Dahlia. "Your schedule for the remaining few weeks of the fall semester. Dumbledore assured me you were up to speed on your Beauxbatons classes?""Yes, professor," Dahlia said adamantly, nodding profusely. Beauxbatons had a different curriculum, but she had kept up with the work expected during her mission. Dahlia had no desire to be behind her classmates when she returned."Good, then you should fit right in with where we are in the semester." McGonagall glanced at the student seated beneath her. "It is good to have you back, Miss Dumbledore."Dahlia blushed as she lowered her gaze. "Thank you, professor."McGonagall strode off without another word, leaving Dahlia to turn back to her fellow Gryffindors. Dahlia skimmed her schedule as Hermione peeped over her shoulder."Damn it!" Hermione huffed, frowning at Dahlia's schedule. "I have double potions every Monday and Wednesday morning but you have it Tuesday and Thursday!""Damn," Dahlia groaned, casting a depressed look at her friend. She scanned the schedule before jolting to her feet. "Merlin's Beard. I've got to go now if I want to get there in time. I'll see you at lunch!"With that Dahlia grasped her bag and tossed it over her shoulder, and disappeared from the Dining Hall. She sprinted through the corridors towards the dungeon, skidding to a halt in front of her Potion's classroom. She dreaded this class, even after all these months. She took a second to inhale slowly, collecting herself before opening the door.It took a moment for her eyes to adjust to the dim room, but eventually she was able to see a smaller class of about fifteen, all looking at her. Dahlia skimmed the room for an empty seat, and found - to her disappointment- that the only empty seat was beside Malfoy.Her stomach churned like lead as she desperately looked around the classroom for anywhere else to sit. All other desks had been push to the side, everyone else partnered up. Dahlia stifled a groan, dragging her feet forward and down the aisle.Of course Malfoy chose a seat in the front of the class. Dahlia's gaze flickered to the front of class where Severus Snape loomed, glaring down at her as she advanced into the r"Kind of you to join us," Professor Snape's voice leered from behind the teacher's desk."Sorry, professor." she emphasized 'professor" unnecessarily, glaring at him. She hadn't forgotten his dislike for her from last year - nor that he had been the one to find her as a baby. Dahlia's lip curled as she glared at the man - resentment swelling inside her. Snape's lip curled in response as he noted her sarcasm, gesturing to the only empty seat."Take your seat next to Mr. Malfoy," Snape instructed. Dahlia huffed, but dropped her bag on the ground next to the empty seat beside the blonde Slytherin boy.Dahlia kept her head held high, refusing to even look at the boy beside her, even though she could feel his eyes on her as she sat next to him. She took the seat beside him, careful not to touch him, even slightly. She pulled her potions book out, still determinedly ignoring his glances at her.Class began, but Dahlia kept feeling Malfoy's eyes on her. He paid no attention to the lecture, nor to the Potion they were supposed to be mimicking. Dahlia set her jaw, determined to continue to ignore him, until finally she snapped. "Take a picture," Dahlia snarled quietly, shooting a venomous glance at him from the corner of her eye, "It'll last longer."Shock flashed across Malfoy's face at her familiar words as he immediately avoided his gaze. His cheeks flushed pink as he snarled back, "Surprised your friends let you out of their sight after you disappeared on them.""I wouldn't concern yourself with my friends," Dahlia muttered heatedly, eyes glued to the board in front of them, refusing to look at him. "You were the one sitting alone. One might wonder if your friends abandoned you, or if you just never had any to begin with?"Malfoy snorted, looking surprised by her venomous words. "Look around, Dumbledore." He retorted through gritted teeth. "You see anyone here worthy of being my friend?"Dahlia glanced around the Potions classroom and was surprised to see mostly Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students. Justin Finch-Fletchy caught her eye and gave her a sour look, causing her to immediately jerk her gaze down. She'd forgotten many of the Hufflepuffs would hate her from the Maze. For her bringing back Cedric, dead.Dahlia chose not to respond to Malfoy. Turns out she hasn't any allies in this class either. She buried her nose in her textbook, turning a cold shoulder to the sneering Slytherin boy beside her."The Final Exam will be two weeks from today; your final assignment will be due prior to taking your exam." Snape's curt voice rang throughout the classroom. "You may work in pairs or alone, but there is to be a ten page essay on the five classes of healing potions, and the basic ingredients needed to make each."The class collectively groaned but Dahlia took hope. They weren't required to have partners, which meant she didn't have to work with Malfoy."For today, open your books to page 174 and choose one of the class three healing potions to attempt today. You have two hours; begin." Snape's voice was curt. He retreated to the seat behind his desk, looking sourly at the class as they began shuffling around the classroom."No comeback, Dumbledore?" Malfoy prodded her some more as she returned with the ingredients necessary for their Blood Restorative Potion.Dahlia ground her teeth, but said nothing back to him as she ignited the fire beneath their cauldron with a swish of her wand. Malfoy studied her silently as she began to throw ingredients into the cauldron with a huff."Damn it," Dahlia swore a few moments later as she rifled through her basket of ingredients, "I forgot the coagulant. Malfoy?" She turned to him for the first time, gesturing for him to go grab it. Surprisingly, he compiled without complaint. He returned, tossing it casually into the cauldron before taking his seat and staring at her again.Dahlia continued to ignore him, although her skin tingled every time she felt his eyes on her. For thirty minutes he said nothing, and she continued to do their potion for the day. Out of the corner of her eye Dahlia saw his mouth open, and she snapped before he could get a word out."Look, why don't we just steer clear of each other?" Dahlia snarled at him, silencing him. "Clearly, the last few months haven't been easy and whatever we had is gone, and frankly it's much better for both of us if we just part ways." Dahlia glared at him defiantly after she finished her speech, her cheeks pink from her outburst.Malfoy looked at her silently, quickly masking the look of surprise and hurt that flashed across his face. Before he could respond, Professor Snape swooped down to their station."Detention!" Snape's hand smacked down on their shared desk. "For both of you. My office, 8pm.""I can't, sir," Dahlia said instantly, looking sweetly up at the potion's master who was decidedly looking away from her gaze. "I have to meet with the headmaster tonight."Snape's eyes flashed as he sneered at Dahlia. "Ah, yes. The headmaster's daughter. We couldn't -""Ward," Dahlia interrupted, correcting him with a smirk as her gaze caught his for the first time. "You, more than anyone, should know that."Snape physically winced at her words, immediately turning away from her. Malfoy watched their interaction with fascination. He remained silent, but internally he was reeling. Dahlia's bold words to a teacher were out of character for her; she'd always been feisty but the fire in her eyes hadn't been there before.Menatally, Malfoy shook himself. He reminded himself of the words she had spoken just before Snape's untimely arrival. She'd basically told him to stay away from her, and as much as her words infuriated him he knew she was right. She was clearly not the same witch, and he wasn't the same wizard. More than that, with his fathers nosy letters about her, the further she was from him the better off she was.Malfoy couldn't resist sneaking a glance at her. There was a different air about her entirely. She carried herself differently. Physically, she had changed as well - she'd grown into a beautiful woman. Her hair was longer, the soft curls falling almost to the small of her back. She'd filled out over the past few months, her breasts now clearly visible even through her school robes. Her hips had widened slightly, giving her more of a woman's body. What Malfoy was stuck on, however, was how her eyes had changed. She'd been happy, her eyes lighting up every time she smiled. Draco remembered it like it was yesterday, how her eyes would shine. Now, however, her eyes were laced with fury and malice, as though she was a bomb waiting to go off of the next person who tried her. Strangely enough, he was more drawn to her now than he had been last year. He found her fire exhilarating, a worthy component.Dahlia felt Malfoy's gaze on her, but she determinedly ignored it. Too much had happened to her for her to just return to him like she was the same person. She was broken, damaged goods and he was better off leaving her alone. Dahlia inhaled, gripping the sides of the desk as she struggled to contain the overwhelming desire to breakdown. She needed this class to be over.

"You told her?" Snape barged into the headmaster's study, dark eyes flashing. Dumbledore didn't even look up at the man in front of him as he chuckled, calmly closing the book he'd been reading. The headmaster pushed his bifocals down on his nose and he regarded the Potion's master with amusement."I had wondered how long it would take her to confront you," the headmaster admitted, his voice full of mirth. He reclined back in the chair as though content to watch the drama unfold."You TOLD her?!" Snape demanded angrily, striding forward until he was directly in front of the headmaster's desk. Nostrils flaring, the greasy haired man glowered down at the headmaster."She had questions," Dumbledore said simply, cocking his head curiously at the wizard in front of him. "Did you expect me to lie or refuse to tell her who her parentage was for forever? About the only man who ever spoke to her mother?"Snape inhaled noisily as his heavy breathing filled the silence between them. He glared at Dumbledore, his black eyes shooting daggers. He remained unmoving, glaring silently at the wizened old man before him."She took longer than I thought to confront you," Dumbledore confessed, relaxing back in his chair, wicked gleam in his blue eyes."How long has she known?" Snape asked sharply, turning his back to the headmaster, pacing the room."Since before the tournament."Snape whirled back around in shock. "What?!""As I said," Dumbledore repeated, a ghost of a smile lingering on his face. "She took much longer to confront you than I anticipated.""She didn't," Snape said, his voice strained. "I called her your daughter, and she corrected me saying she was your ward and that I, of all people, should know that."Dumbledore guffawed loudly. "She came back with some fire in her," he said as he wiped the merriment from his eyes."Albus," Snape said frostily, "No one can know she is..."He never finished his sentence, the words dying on the tip of his tongue awkwardly."No worries, professor," Dahlia's voice rang out from behind them. Snape whirled around, his already pale face now ghostly white. Dahlia stood in the doorway, fury radiating off of her."I-""I'm sorry you hate me because my mother looked like the woman you loved," Dahlia snarled as she advanced towards the two men before her. Snape was stunned by her words, jaw grinding. He shot an accusatory glance at Dumbledore, who feigned innocence.Snape opened his mouth - most likely to defend his actions - but Dahlia interrupted him."I'm sorry the woman you loved died; truly, I am, and I'm sorry you had to relive that with my mother, but I don't appreciate you attempting to rile me up in front of an entire class." Dahlia tossed at the Slytherin man. Snape's face contorted in rage at the mention of Lily. He turned to give Dumbledore a cold, menacing glare before speaking coldly to Dahlia."You'd think you'd have a little more respect for the man who saved your life."Dahlia threw her head back and laughed. "Thank you?" She asked in amazement, a mad laugh erupting from her throat as she stared at him incredulously. "You want me to thank you for bringing me to a time where there is a war brewing, and I can do nothing but stand by the sidelines and watch while my friends fight?"Snape was struck speechless at her words, staring at her in silent shock. Dumbledore also seemed to be equally silent by her outrage. Dahlia bit her quivering lip, curling her hands into fists until her nails cut her palms."Actually, can you leave?" Dahlia didn't even look at the man who had "saved her life". She focused her eyes on Dumbeldore who regarded her warily. Snape's head snapped up, his gaze swinging to Dumbledore. The headmaster seemed surprised by Dahlia's request, both men looking at her in shock."What?" Dahlia snapped, looking back and forth between them. "You got to toss me aside like unwanted trash. Shouldn't I have the same choice now?""Dah-""I want to speak to my guardian alone," Dahlia said firmly, dismissing Snape with a wave of her hand. Snape left without a second glance back at her, cloak billowing behind him as he slammed the door in his wake.Dahlia stared at the closed door behind him for several long moments before turning to the headmaster. "What did you need to see me for?" Dahlia asked Dumbledore crossly as she crossed her arms over her chest.Dumbledore sat behind his desk looking at her curiously. At her question, he cleared his throat before speaking, apparently willing to ignore her attitude with her professor. "I called you here to inform you that I'm adding additional training over the holiday break."Dahlia raised her eyebrows, face still a stony mask of anger. "What kind of training?""Private lessons with me."Her brows crept further up her forehead. "What will we be studying?""Occlumency," Dumbledore said casually. Dahlia's interest peaked, her arms slowly unfolding from her chest. Occlumency was a complicated magic practice; the only professions that taught it were the Unspeakables in the Department of Mysteries."Mind reading?""Yes," Dumbledore hummed, latching onto her curiosity. "Mr. Potter has already been taking such classes with Professor Snape."Dahlia's eyes flew open wide in surprise. "Harry's already doing these lessons?""Yes," Dumbledore nodded casually. "He seems to be struggling with it, and I thought perhaps if we offered you some training, you could assist him.""Oh!" Dahlia found herself nodding; if this was how she could help Harry she'd do it. "Yes, of course.""Perfect. I'll owl you the time and place of our first class. Shall we say three nights a week?""Sure," Dahlia agreed as she began to make her way to the door, thoughts spinning. Suspicions raised, she began to quicken her pace towards the door. It was odd that Dumbledore wanted to request Occlumency lessons now, so soon after her return from Beauxbatons."Oh, and Dahlia?" Dumbledore's voice caught her on her way out the door. She paused, turning back."Yes, headmaster?" Dahlia poked her head back into his office."What of your detention with Professor Snape?""Inform him I chose to not attend."The door slammed shut behind her.Dahlia wiped the tears from her eyes as she scampered down the stairs from the headmaster's study. She'd managed to shield her emotions in Albus's office during her confrontation with Snape, but now the dam was broken. Her hands were shaking as she stumbled through the hallways. She wasn't sure why she was breaking down after the confrontation with Snape, but it seemed to be her limit. Her throat felt like it was closing as she wrestled with the emotions she desperately wanted to choke back.Anger was forthright - white, hot anger at Albus for his secrets and lies, Snape an accomplice to them. Despair at her situation, doomed to be stuck on the sidelines, the thought of watching her friends fight while she sat by helpless taunted her. Images of dead friends floated across her mind, her legs weakening.Her vision swam before her eyes as she stumbled down one of the long corridors. A sob left her throat and she picked up her pace, tripping as she tried to break into a run. Dahlia squeezed her eyes shut against the images flashing before her eyes: Cedric's face as he died, Rudolphus's body exploding before her, Voldemort's scream echoed through her head. Newer memories joined the old taunts, images of the Beauxbatons boys as they passed her a drink that made her vision swim more."No!" Dahlia choked out the cry as she pushed open the first door she stumbled upon. Her breathing was ragged, difficult. She tried to hold back her sobs as she stumbled into the room without second thought. Her entire body was shaking as she slammed the door shut behind her, collapsing against it as her vision went black.Her breaths became shallow as the panic began to settle over her. It was a panic attack - she was prone to having them lately. Dahlia sank to her knees, her hands covering her ears as the ghost echoes of Voldemort's scream echoed in her ears. Cedric's face, her blood covered body. Dahlia let loose another ear piercing scream as she sobbed uncontrollably. The fear inside her kept building until Dahlia was shaking so badly she couldn't hear a voice calling to her."Dumbledore!" The voice was familiar, but far away, echoing.It was enough to pull her from the dark images floating in her head, and she opened her eyes. She was sitting in knee deep water, her clothes in tatters on her body. The room she had fallen into she now recognized as a boys bathroom, and it was destroyed. Every mirror had been blown out, every sink had been reduced to rubble. The faucets were leaking from their pipes in the wall, and a small crater had formed on the floor and was quickly filling with water.Dahlia panted as she looked at the damage around her before groaning and pushing to her feet as though in a daze. She braced her hands on her head, trying to steady herself."What the hell was that?"Dahlia spun around, unaware she had an audience for her meltdown. Standing in front of a stall, his fly still down, was Draco Malfoy. He was gaping at her, jaw hung, eyes wide, concern on his face.Dahlia swore softly, using the wall to balance her. She exhaled noisily before snarling at the Slytherin, "Don't worry about it!" She hastily wiped the remaining tears from her eyes as she glared at Malfoy. She never would have allowed herself to break down like that if she knew she'd had an audience.Malfoy stood speechless, staring at her. His eyes roamed her body, searching for signs of injury. His mouth was agape, staring at her as they stood in the middle of the chaos she had created. Water poured from open pipes, splashing on to the ground, filling the silence. Dahlia fought against the shudder that wracked her body, hands still shaky."Well?" Dahlia growled, looking half manic with her red eyes and tattered clothes as she glared defiantly at Malfoy. "Why are you still here?""This is the boys bathroom," The words were lame, even to him as he continued to stare at the crazed witch before him. She seemed to have caught him completely off guard, leaving him stunned.Dahlia let out a loud breath, trying to collect her thoughts. Her mind was still reeling as she glanced around the destroyed bathroom, trying to calm herself."Are you okay?" His words were hesitant, as though he'd never said them before."Do I look okay?" Dahlia retorted, laughing sourly. She waved her wand, and the bathroom began to right itself. Sinks returned to their rightful spots on the walls, water trickling backwards into the pipes. Tiles grounded themselves back to the floor and walls, the crater filling itself in as the puzzle pieces organized themselves.. She avoided Malfoy's gaze as she continued to repair the room she had destroyed, deliberately avoiding his gaze.Malfoy said nothing as several minutes passed as the room repaired itself. As soon as the last piece was in place Dahlia turned on her heel to leave. "Your fly is down," she called over her shoulder as she stormed from the bathroom, not bothering to see if he checked.Malfoy stared at the door Dahlia had just stormed out of. He glanced around the repaired bathroom, the hair on his neck still standing from her screams. He'd been mid-piss when he had heard someone come in. He hadn't thought anything of it, and certainly hadn't been prepared for the torture screams that immediately followed. The first shriek had scared him so bad he'd frozen in place, chilled to the bone. He'd heard those screams before, the night of the tournament.The moment her scream ended Malfoy was able to move; he'd rushed out of the stall just as the second scream had ripped through her throat. His wand had been drawn, anticipating a threat. The sight that met his eyes wasn't what he'd been expecting. Dahlia, in a ball on the floor, screaming as though she'd been tortured. He'd stood there, unsure of what to do when suddenly things had started imploding.The mirrors above the sinks went first, then the sinks themselves. He'd almost attacked instinctively, whirling around to try to locate the attacker. It took Draco a moment to realize no one was attacking her; she was subconsciously destroying things. The magic around her magnified, expanding until it filled the room, suffocating the air.On that realization that Dahlia was the one destroying the bathroom, Draco had cast a silencing charm around the room. Dahlia had sunk to her knees, sinks still exploding around her as she screamed. Malfoy knew this moment wasn't something other people were supposed to see.Something he wasn't supposed to see.He'd watched silently as she had fallen apart, forcing himself to remain by the stall. His heart was still beating loudly in his chest, as he felt it break. She was guarded, angry, and defiant. What had happened to her that made her like this? Surely it wasn't just the graveyard? Malfoy ground his teeth against the anger surging through him. He waited until she fled the scene to show any emotion, dropping his calm mask and swinging a fist at a nearby mirror with a yell. Someone had hurt her.The twins found Dahlia on the Astronomy tower, mid joint."Well, hello there," George cooed as he sat down next to her. Dahlia blatantly ignored them as Fred sat down on her other side. She wasn't in the mood for jokes or games today - she wasn't in the mood for company at all."It's rude not to share," Fred pointed out, sticking his hand out expectantly. Dahlia rolled her eyes before passing him the joint wordlessly."Cheers," he said with a wicked grin as he took a puff. The twins passed the joint around a few times before George turned solemnly to Dahlia."You know, if you ever wanna talk, we promise to listen."Dahlia froze, unsure of what to say. Her eyes flickered back and forth between them uneasily, unsure of what they were referencing, unsure of what they had heard."I-""That doesn't mean you have to," Fred jumped in reassuringly. He scooted closer and put an arm around Dahlia's shoulder, tucking her into his chest. "It just means if you ever decided you want to talk about anything, we promise to listen.""Just listen," George added softly with a soft smile as he offered her the joint. "It doesn't have to be something we talk about."Dahlia squeezed her eyes shut against the tears that were suddenly threatening to overflow. Her throat felt clogged as she sniffed, overwhelmed by their support. "Th-thank you," She whispered, "I'm just not ready."The twins nodded, Fred giving her a chaste kiss on the top of her head. "That's alright too.""C'mon now," George stood, offering her his hand. "We need to get back before Umbridge finds out we're not in our dorms."Dahlia wrinkled her nose at the mention of the new professor, allowing the twins to drag her up to her feet. "Is she really that bad?"The twins nodded solemnly, tugging her towards the stairs with a look of surprise. "You haven't had her class yet?""I have it tomorrow after breakfast," Dahlia said with a grimace.

The next morning started off bad. Hermione and her both overslept, dashing out of bed with mere minutes to spare. They arrived at the Dining Hall in a hurried fluster, throwing their book bags on the ground without abandon, piling their plates high with food. Dahlia was shoveling eggs into her mouth while Hermione downed a waffle, neither speaking to their Gryffindor mates sitting next to them."Geez," Harry looked between them, baffled by their behavior. "You guys are eating like Ron."That immediately caused both Gryffindor girls to slow down, almost choking on the food in their mouths as they attempted to argue his words. Before Dahlia could defend herself against Harry's hurtful statement, her name was called, echoing through the Dining Room."Dumbledore!" A foreign voice called across the hall. Instinctively, Dahlia glanced around, almost flinching, unsure if someone was calling for her or the headmaster. Several heads swiveled her way, causing her to wince as she looked for the source of the call. Her gaze finally met that of a familiar looking Hufflepuff's, and Dahlia rolled her eyes. Cedric's second was striding purposefully towards her, determination in his walk."What do you want, Higgleton?" Dahlia sneered his last name at him tauntingly as he came to a stop in front of her. The Gryffindor table seemed to be holding their breath, anticipating the fight to come."I want to know why the hell you came back clutching Cedric's dead body." His words hung in the air of the great hall, silencing even the Slytherin table. Everyone glanced amongst themselves, whispers floating around as all eyes glued to her.Dahlia ground her teeth, seething. She pushed her seat back from the table and stood, bracing herself with her hands against the table, leaning over it to glare at Higgleton. "Did you ever think that maybe if you had done YOUR JOB as his SECOND he might still be there?" Dahlia spat at the Hufflepuff, pushing her chair back all the way so she could walk around it. She stalked towards him, closing the space between them like a predator stalking its prey."Did it ever cross your pathetic mind to ENTER the maze at the start of the horn? The rest of us did." Dahlia advanced toward Higgleton with every step, deliberation in her movements, hatred in her gaze. His gaze began to flicker down as pink flushed his face in embarrassment, but her's never wavered from his face."Where the hell were you when John, Hermione, and I ran into the maze?" Dahlia looked around at the silent Great Hall who were grasping at her every word. She let out a small, almost insane cackle as she spun back around to face Higgleton. "That's right. You didn't enter the maze at the starting bell."Dahlia walked straight up to him until she was nose to nose with the Hufflepuff boy. "I'll bet 50 galleons you didn't enter the maze at all."Silence filled the great hall at her bet. Higgleton looked down in shame, refusing to meet Dahlia's gaze."Well?!" Dahlia turned to the Hufflepuff table, glaring indignantly at the older students who sat near Higgleton, demanding an answer. "Did he enter the maze at all?"For a few moments no one spoke, and no one moved. Then, slowly, a second year student looked up at Dahlia and shook her head, bottom lip quivering."COWARD!" Dahlia yelled, spinning to face the now cowering Hufflepuff behind her. Her voice carried throughout the hall, drawing even the teacher's attention. "You DARE act entitled to know how Cedric died, when it was YOUR PLACE to be there to prevent it!"Higgleton started crying, as did several other students in the Dining Hall. Dahlia already had tears in her eyes, but she held them back as she continued to yell. "I did EVERYTHING I could do to defend him!" Dahlia screamed, pushing Higgleton slightly so that he fell backwards over his seat. "I AVENGED HIS DEATH!" Dahlia spat, leaning over so she was nose to nose with the quivering Hufflepuff boy."Remember that the next time you feel entitled to my story," Dahlia snarled loudly enough so that the surrounding students could hear her. "Remember that you were a crying, cowardly little boy who abandoned his friend, while I lived and died in that maze for Cedric."Dahlia straightened, turning to face the stunned Dining Hall around her. She didn't know when the tears had fallen, but they had. Her cheeks were coated in tears, droplets free falling from her face. Her eyes scanned her own table until they landed on Harry. His cheeks were wet with tears, though she found a moment of comfort in the fury that lay behind his gaze. Her gaze continued down the table until she met Hermione's gaze.Hermione, to her credit, was not crying. She had a murderous, fierce look on her face, glaring indignantly at the Hufflepuff. The moment Dahlia's gaze met her's, Hermione's gaze softened, and she hastened to her feet. She strode up to Dahlia, offering her hand. "Let's go," Hermione said shortly, completely ignoring the cowering Hufflepuff at Dahlia's feet.Dahlia took Hermione's hand and let her lead her from the Dining Hall. Hermione led her straight to the girls bathroom, immediately putting up a silencing charm, and a locking charm to keep anyone else from coming in."Come here," Hermione whispered, pulling Dahlia in for a hug. Dahlia embraced her friend, trying to hold back the new wave of tears that was forming. She failed, letting out a shuddering cry as she buried her face in Hermione's shoulder."No, don't cry." Hermione pushed back so she could look Dahlia in the eye, wiping her tears away with the pad of her thumb. "You have Umbridge's class next.""So?" Dahlia sniffed, wiping her cheeks with the backs of her hands, dispelling evidence of her tears."Umbridge is Under-Secretary to the Minister of Magic. She's sort of "scoping out" Hogwarts for the Ministry." Hermione glanced around the bathroom to ensure they were alone before leaning in. "She doesn't believe Harry and Dumbledore when they say that You-Know-Who is back. She pushes Harry in horrible ways when he speaks out against it. She'll do the same to you now that you're here."Dahlia looked at Hermione in shock, shaking her head as though she didn't want to believe it. "And Albus has allowed her to stay on?"Hermione shrugged, scowling slightly. "It's Ministry decreed. I don't think he can do much about it."Dahlia ground her teeth but nodded. "Okay."Hermione gave her an encouraging smile. "Good. Okay, off you go. If you leave now you might have time to sit with someone who isn't a Slytherin." With a wink, Hermione pushed open the door to the bathroom and pulled Dahlia out into the corridor, ushering her to her classes.Draco was intrigued by the display in the Dining Hall, even if he was slightly disgusted at his urge to beat the little prat Higgleton into a pulp for speaking to Dahlia that way. Beating Higgleton into a pulp was a pleasant thought, but the motivation behind it was what disturbed him. He'd felt the need to come to her aide... only to have her prove that she didn't need him to. Her rage had been apparent - she'd put on quite a show at breakfast. He'd enjoyed watching her snap at the Hufflepuff, putting him resoundledy in his place. Draco scowled, chiding himself for his wandering thoughts. She meant nothing to him - they were nothing to each other.He knew he was supposed to be pushing her away. His father's cryptic letters made sure he never forgot his Aunt Bella was out for her blood. Draco knew the Death Eaters were looking for her; not actively searching, but looking for her nonetheless. And with the threats his father has made, it is apparent that whatever task Lucius Malfoy was given... If he fails, the punishment is worse than death. And Dahlia had posed herself as a threat. Draco knew he was too dangerous to her; his family was too dangerous for her, yet somehow she was more intriguing now than she had been a year ago.Her rage is what he was drawn to. Back talking professors was new for her, and her threats to the Hufflepuffs had been immensely satisfying. However, the bathroom incident had left him shattered and in awe. She hadn't even had her wand in her hand, and her pure emotions had decimated the room. Wandless magic was unpredictable, and hard to conjure. Wands were used to direct and control the magic, not produce it. The magic comes from the wizard itself; wands are just conductors. But even great wizards typically never managed to do more than levitate or make their bed wandless.Dahlia had destroyed a bathroom.Something had changed in the last few months, and Draco was certain it was more to do than the night of the Triwizard tournament. That left a dark cloud in his mind, scenarios appearing, each worse than the next. Where had she gone all those months? And what had happened to her?Dahlia pushed open the door to the Defense Against the Dark Arts class. She stifled a groan as she saw the collection of students inside. Due to her late entry in the semester, she had been placed into whatever classes had availabilities. Unfortunately, that meant several classes with Slytherins and Hufflepuffs.Dahlia scurried to claim a desk, placing herself as far away from the scowling Hufflepuffs as she could, even if that meant sitting amongst the Slytherins. While their looks were more wary than hateful, she avoided them all the same. Clearly, her display at breakfast hadn't been forgotten. A few moments before class was scheduled to begin, the large doors swung open and a small, toad-like woman dressed in a bright pink pants suit waddled in. Her heels made a click-clacking sound as she strode to the stage in front of class.The class was eerily silent as the pink woman padded to the front of the class until she turned to face them. "Mhm!"Dahlia glanced around, noticing the subtle looks of contempt students were throwing at the professor's back. If the Slytherins and the Hufflepuffs could both hold so much disdain for the women she had to be truly awful. Dahlia observed the woman hesitantly, suspiciously."Welcome, class," the professor's high, sickly sweet voice rang through the classroom as though amplified. "As you all know, I am Delores Umbridge, Under Secretary to the Minister of Magic, and your Defense Against the Dark arts teacher this term."Dahlia hated the woman already. Her voice was falsely sweet, almost sickly."We have a new student today," Umbridge continued, her eyes falling on Dahlia. Dahlia suppressed a shudder; Umbridge's eyes were lifeless and calculating, the look in her eyes similar to the one she'd seen in Rudolphus's eyes before she'd killed him. "Stand, dear, and introduce yourself."Dahlia pushed to her feet, trying to ignore the blush that was coloring her cheeks as the class's eyes flickered to her. She inhaled deeply, her voice soft. "I'm not new.""Pardon me?""I'm not new," Dahlia repeated, louder this time as she returned Umbridge's gaze with a blank stare. "I attended Hogwarts last year."Umbridge's nose wrinkled in confusion, peering down her spectacles oddly.. "And why didn't you return at the start of term like the other students?"Dahlia felt a chill shiver down her spine, but she refused to show weakness, steadily returning the professor's gaze. "I'm Dahlia Dumbledore," Dahlia began but Umbridge interrupted."You're Albus's daughter?"Typically, Dahlia would correct such a statement, but the look of disbelief that flashed across the smug woman's face was too good to give up, so she let it slide. Instead she smiled at the toad-like woman and responded, "I've been away for the last few months trying to collect myself after the Triwizard tournament last year."Umbridge's eyes flew open wide as the mention of the tournament. Dahlia watched closely as the woman processed her words, torn between questioning Albus's presumed daughter, or correcting her. Finally, Umbridge decided to dismiss it. "Yes, well, thank you, Miss Dumbledore, you may take your seat."Dahlia sat back down, a scowl on her face as Umbridge turned her back on the class to face the blackboard."Today we will be practicing wand movements for defensive spells. Everyone, come grab a training wand from my desk and open your book to page 202." Umbridge's voice rang out as the words wrote themselves on the chalkboard at the front of class."Wand movements?" Dahlia couldn't hide her surprise. She looked up to find Umbridge glaring at her, but she continued anyway. "That's first year stuff!"Other students were glancing smugly amongst themselves, others in fear, but Dahlia ignored them. Had no one bothered to speak up about this? She glanced around at her classmates, incredulously asking for backup. All ignored her gaze, or shook their heads slightly."You will raise your hand before speaking in my class," Umbridge corrected her with a tight-lipped attempt at a smile, shoes clicking down the raised stairs of the stage. "The basics -""- are for beginners," Dahlia spoke without being called on, but her arm shot into the air. "Our O.W.L.'s are in a few months, and you expect us to pass them by only knowing the basics and using training wands? How does that prepare us for a real life scenario?"A few students were nodding in agreement with her now, mostly the Slytherins while the Hufflepuff's looked on in fear. The nods of agreement were enough to spur Dahlia on, fueling her determined stare."Miss Dumbledore, when would you need to apply these spells in a 'real life scenario'?" Umbridge's voice was strained, but still sickly sweet as she glared at Dahlia, advancing down the line of desks until she stood only a few feet from her."I already have."Students started whispering."I used them last year in the maze."The classroom went silent, everyone holding their breath."Are you saying you were there, in the maze, Miss Dumbledore?" Umbridge couldn't contain her anger; her voice was shaking. The other students seemed to be clinging onto Dahlia's every word; she had the undivided attention of everyone in the room."I was Harry Potter's second," Dahlia was glad her voice was strong, despite her shaking hands. She clenched them into fists, willing herself to calm down She hadn't talked about the tournament since the night it had happened. "I fought the Death Eaters and Voldemort -" Umbridge gasped at the use of his name, as did several other students but Dahlia continued, " in the graveyard." Dahlia met Umbridge's threatening gaze with one of her own, refusing to back down. "And I needed a lot more than the basics and a training wand.""Detention!" Umbridge shrieked. "You dare to speak these lies in my class!"Dahlia fixed Umbridge with a cold, calculating look. Hermione had warned her about Umbridge, but she hadn't realized how horrible the woman really was. "They aren't lies; it's the truth. I fought beside Harry and -" her voice trembled for a second but she steadied herself "- and Cedric Diggory until the Death Eater's murdered him!"At Cedric's name, several Hufflepuff's turned their gazes to Umbridge, fixing her with glares worthy of Slytherins if she dared blasphemy their Golden Boy's name. Dahlia appreciated the support, how ever second party it might be."2 nights of detention!" Umbridge was furious, spitting she was so enraged. "You-Know-Who has not returned. How dare you -""How dare I?" Dahlia's eyebrows flew up. Defying the return of Voldemort was the same as saying Cedric died in vain, and Dahlia wouldn't allow that. She'd fought to hard to prevent that to back down now. "You are the one teaching elemental, beginner magic to OWL students! It makes me wonder, professor, are you incapable of performing the magic itself, or is the Ministry purposely ill preparing students for war so Voldemort can win that much easier?"The class collectively gasped. Dahlia didn't know if it was by her use of Voldemort's name, or her brazen, challenging words to the professor that shocked them, but ultimately she didn't care.Umbridge took several deep breaths before pinning her fake smile back onto her face. "Detention, Miss Dumbledore, for a week. Everyone, turn to page 202 in your books."Dahlia gritted her teeth, but opened her book. She zoned out as Umbridge droned on for 30 minutes about how to cast a protection charm, thoughts drifting to more pleasant thoughts of hexing the toad woman when she was jerked awake to Umbridge's voice sharply calling her name."Miss Dumbledore!"Dahlia opened her eyes, blinking slowly, her gaze fixing on the pink woman at the front of class. She must have drifted off. Umbridge was gesturing for her to come forward before the class, most instantly. Dahlia pushed away from her desk, and hesitantly stepped forward, still confused as to why she was being summoned. The entire class watched silently as Dahlia approached Umbridge at the front of the classroom."Since Miss Dumbledore is so adamant about using the spells, we will allow her to practice the movements in a 'real scenario" . Umbridge extended a training wand to Dahlia, who looked at it with confusion as she stepped onto the stage."I'm sorry, professor, I don't understand." She accepted the useless thing anyways, eyeing it was apprehension."You are going to mimic the movement the class has been practicing," Umbridge explained with a tsk, malicious mirk forming on her face. "I will shoot a hex at Miss Dumbledore, she will attempt to mimic the wand motions for a shield or protection charm."You're shooting a real hex at her, but she only gets a training wand to defend herself?"Dahlia was shocked to find one of the Slytherin's had spoken out for her, the student glancing in shock between her and Umbridge. Apparently even the Slytherins demanded a fair fight, many looking disgruntled by the rigged duel."Yes," Umbridge didn't even attempt to hide her evil smile, looking questioningly at the interrupting student. The boy closed his mouth, stopping any further protest, though he wore a disgruntled look on his face."That's not fair!" A Hufflepuff spoke out this time, glaring at Umbridge. Dahlia's eyes flew open, surprised by the support from students she knew to resent her.Dahlia gestured for the students to hush, thanking them with a smile. "It's fine," She called out to the class with a wink, hoping to lighten the tense mood. "I told you she couldn't perform the charm itself."The class snickered at her comment, Umbridge snarled, a manic gleam in her eye. "You wanted the practical application, dear."Dahlia rolled her eyes as she faced her professor, holding the dummy wand with skepticism. "Practical application would require an actual wand, I'm afraid."Umbridge said nothing, only gestured for a nearby student to signal the start of the duel."Wands ready," a Hufflepuff student stepped onto the stage between Dahlia and Umbridge. He looked to Dahlia first for confirmation, offering her a meager look of encouragement. Dahlia held the training wand out before her, trying to avoid the crazed look in Umbridge's eyes. A movement by the back of class caught Dahlia's attention. A flash of silver blonde hair. Dahlia glanced at it, her mouth dropping slightly. She hadn't realized Malfoy was in this class. Dahlia felt a tingle go down her spine as Draco shot her a bemused grin. He was concerned - that much was evident, but he'd found her mouthy comments amusing. She could have sworn he winked at her, but before she could confirm it, the duel began."The duel begins with the sparks," The Hufflepuff boy - Ernie MacMillan - spoke. Dahlia forced her gaze back to her opponent, Umbridge looking half mad as she leered at Dahlia. The class was holding its breath, shifting to ensure they were out of the range of fire."Ready!"Dahlia braced herself, standing feet shoulder width apart, meeting Umbridge's gaze with a challenging one of her own. Umbridge set a foot backwards, opting for a fighting stance."Begin!" Red sparks flew from Ernie's wand, signaling the start of the duel.As soon as Dahlia saw the sparks she dropped the training wand. No point in using a fake wand that was meant to dampen powers in an attempt to help control magic. Umbridge shouted her curse, as Dahlia took her right hand and mimicked the wand movements Umbridge had forced upon them - wand movements she'd been using for years. She drew a figure eight horizontally in the air, and then pushed outwards in front of her. Instantly a huge, cloudy shield erupted in front of her, catching Umbridge's yellow hex and ricocheting it back towards Delores.Umbridge didn't react in time, her own hex striking her directly over her heart. On impact, Umbridge was shot backwards fifteen feet where she slammed into the castle wall, unceremoniously crumpling to the ground.The entire class erupted into cheers as Dahlia took a bow, not bothering to hide her mischievous grin. "Thank you, thank you," Dahlia took another bow, her classmates jumping onstage to clap her on the back, celebrating her triumph. Even Slytherins surrounded her, reaching out to pat her back, her head, her shoulder - anything within reach.Dahlia laughed, ducking awkwardly away from the hands of her classmates. She approached their professor, bending down to check her pulse before shooting an amused glance back at her class. "Guess she really is just incapable of casting a protection charm."The class immediately roared in laughter, looking up at Dahlia with new respect. Dahlia walked away from Umbridge's unconscious form, stalking down the aisles, pushing her way past the students who were still celebrating."Where'd you learn wandless magic?" An older Slytherin called out. Dahlia paused, glancing backwards at the student, recognizing him as Blaise Zabini. She hesitated, memories of Beauxbatons flashing, the hours of training spent honing her skills. The graveyard flashed through her mind next - the first place she'd used wandless magic."I had some spare time," Dahlia said with a shrug as she continued to scan the room of happy students. Her comment caused some commotion, students whispering amongst themselves. She ignored them, eyes skimming the crowd until they landed on a tall Slytherin boy, positioned in the back of the crowd. Malfoy's smirk fell into her view, and she couldn't resist glancing at him. He was already looking at her, his grey eyes dancing with laughter and merriment. He cocked his head to her, almost as though impressed. Dahlia smirked, glancing down as she reached for her bag, cheeks blushing pink.Dahlia was about to make her exit when she realized Delores was still unconscious on the stage. Annoyed, Dahlia paused, scanning the room. "Goyle! Crabb!" Dahlia waved them over, approaching Umbridge's body. The two large Slytherins waddled forward, obviously shocked she had selected them.Dahlia gestured to the pink professor against the wall. "Get her to the Hospital Wing, would you?"The two buffoons grunted, glancing at Malfoy for permission. Draco's nod of approval wasn't lost to Dahlia, but she continued regardless. She hopped down from the stage, wading through the crowd of students as she spoke merrily."Well, ladies and gentlemen," Dahlia called out as she moved toward the door. "I hope you enjoyed the show!" Dahlia started to skip to the door, breaking free of the crowd. She threw her weight against the door, heaving it open."Class dismissed!"

"Dahlia!" Harry's voice called out to her, causing Dahlia to slow her pace so he could catch up. She was leaving the library a few hours later. Defense Against the Dark Arts had been her last class of the day, leaving her a few open periods to complete homework in the Library."Hey, Harry!" Dahlia said cheerfully as the two fell in step together. She stole a glance at her friend, noting the bags under his eyes, his mussed hair. He hadn't admitted it, but she knew hew as having trouble sleeping. She hadn't forgotten that he'd been in the maze too - he'd bore witness to the horrible things. If they plagued her, they certainly plagued him."The headmaster asked for me to tell you to meet him in his study." Even his voice sounded tired.Dahlia wrinkled her nose, attempting to act normal, adverting her scrutiny. "What for?"Harry shrugged, meeting her eyes with a knowing look. "Didn't say."Dahlia rolled her eyes, groaning sheepishly. He looked at her like he had already heard what had happened. "Probably the Umbridge incident earlier.""I heard about that!" Harry's eyes sparkled, a satisfied smile breaking out on his face. "Brilliant work, that was."Dahlia smirked, amber eyes glinting mischievously. "Thanks, it felt great.""I, uh, have something to show you," Harry's voice dropped so only she could hear him, his eyes scanning the halls as though worried someone would hear him. "Meet me on the seventh floor after your meeting with Dumbledore.""Alright," Dahlia curiously agreed, cutting Harry an intrigued look. Harry flashed her a smile in response, and then disappeared down a nearby hallway. She altered her course and headed for the headmaster's study, only to find a familiar, blonde Slytherin entering the gargoyle as she approached.Dahlia tossed him a scathing look as she approaching, "You were summoned as well?"Malfoy returned her look with a cold one, glancing over his shoulder. He kept his answer and voice short. "Looks like it.""Do you know what they want?" She attempted at conversation, more so that she was aware on what she was walking into than the urge to talk to him. Or so she told herself.Malfoy rolled his eyes as the gargoyle opened for them, revealing the stairwell. "You throwing a professor against a wall doesn't give you a big enough hint?"Dahlia didn't bother to hide her look of glee at the memory as she followed him up the stairs. "She wanted me to demonstrate."The corners of Malfoy's mouth turned upward ever so slightly, but he didn't respond. The staircase delivered them to the hallway leading to the headmaster's study. Malfoy took a step forward first. Dahlia hung back, memories of the last time she had entered this hallway with Draco at the forefront of her mind.She didn't even notice Malfoy had stopped with his hand on the headmaster's door knob until he spoke. "Coming?"His voice brought her back to reality and she nodded, forcing herself to put one foot in front of the other until she stood next to Malfoy at the door. He opened the door for her, gesturing Dahlia in first before stepping in behind her."Her!" Umbridge's shrill voice was the first thing to reach Dahlia's ears and she flinched, eyes adjusting to the dimness of her guardian's office. "Miss Dumbledore is the one!"Dahlia stole a look at her guardian, trying to determine if he was upset about this, only to find relief when his blue eyes were twinkling with merriment. His face was solemn, but she'd learned long ago the secret to his emotions laid in his eyes. Right now, they were merry, tears of amusement in them. She stifled a grin, masking her face to be void of emotion; this wasn't the fight she'd thought she was walking into."Miss Dumbledore," Minerva McGonagall's voice rang out, crisp and stern. "Do you care to explain yourself?""Yes," Dahlia shot a smug look at the pink clad woman glaring indignantly at her. She turned to face her guardian as she spoke, addressing him and her head of house exclusively. "Professor Umbridge's teaching style is unfit for advanced students, such as OWL and NEWT level classes. She spent half the class today going over wand movements for protection spells," Dahlia shot a glanced at a flustered Umbridge, "something she would have realized we learned first-year if she had bothered to check our past curriculums!"Umbridge's face flushed red, and she started to open her mouth to defend herself when Dahlia cut her off with a withering glare. "I'm not done."Umbridge's mouth snapped shut. Malfoy turned in surprise to Dahlia, but she pushed forward. "Then professor Umbridge decided she wanted to display the wand movements "in a real scenarios" so she called me to the front of class, and gave me a training wand to attempt to block hexes as she fired them at me."McGonagall gasped, whirling around indignantly to Umbridge. "You attempted to hex a student while they had nothing but a training wand to defend themself?!"Even Malfoy winced at the raw fury in the Transfiguration Professor's voice. Umbridge remained indignant, stomping her foot in protest."It wasn't -""Delores," it was Dumbledore who cut her off this time, his voice grave. "Is this true?"Umbridge's face turned a deeper shade of crimson as she turned to face the headmaster. "She used magic against a teacher!" Umbridge snapped accusingly, pointing at Dahlia."Unfortunately, it doesn't count when a teacher attacks an unarmed student first!" Minerva was practically screeching. "In all my years of teaching I've never heard -""She attacked me!" Umbridge shrieked indignantly, fat finger jabbing towards Dahlia."Actually, professor, you attacked me," Dahlia interjected with a smirk. "I have an entire class of students who will attest to that. You simply neglected to take into account my previous words."Umbridge seemed confused by her statement, so Dahlia leaned towards her, bracing herself against the desk. "Did I not tell you wand movements were for first years? For Merlin's sake, a shield charm is third year stuff! Draco Malfoy cast a shield charm to protect me from the dragon during the first event last year! "A furious shriek left Umbridge's throat as she growled at Dahlia. "I-""We do not use training wands with anyone over second year," Dumbledore said with a frown towards Umbridge, cutting off the pink witch's words. "We especially do not use them in duels.""The Minister of Magic-" Umbridge started, attempting to look professional, drawing herself to her full four foot ten height.Dumbledore silenced her with a bored look. "I am aware you have been chosen by Cornelius Fudge.""Then I'll have you know, he has given me the authority to expel students as necessary. After Miss Dumbledore's display in class -""Absolutely not!" McGonagall's voice interrupted, astonished and full of rage. "Dahlia Dumbledore is a Gryffindor, which places her in my house." Dahlia almost teared up at the sound of pride in her professor's voice, the haughty manner in which the elder witch spoke. "Miss Dumbledore did nothing more than perform the spell she was asked, properly!""She wasn't supposed to do the spell!" Umbridge screamed furiously. "Only the motions!""You're telling me you wanted Miss Dumbledore to allow you to hit her with an unknown hex?" McGonagall's hand slammed down on the professor's desk, causing Dahlia and Draco to jump. "You're saying that you wanted Miss Dumbledore to not protect herself? You didn't want an OWL STUDENT performing a simple shield charm?!"Dahlia had never seen the Transfiguration teacher in such a fury before, and it was quite scary. Dahlia had subconsciously taken a step back, unaware Draco had done the same, only shifting so he was partially obscuring her body as though to protect her."Why would a student ever need a Shield or Protection charm in -"A roar of rage left McGonagall's throat as she picked up the closest thing, which happened to be an old copy of Hogwarts: A History and hurled it at the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. The book sailed through the air until it hit Umbridge square in the jaw, knocking her head back and causing the woman to fall onto the floor."Either charm would have protected you from that, you blithering idiot!"Dahlia felt like her eyes were going to pop out of her head. Her hands clapped over her mouth, attempting to smother the snort of laughter that threatened to escape. Minerva McGonagall - prim, proper, Minerva McGonagall - had just launched a book at Delores Umbridge and hit her in the face. Draco was watching the exchange with the same amount of shock and amusement as Dahlia, glancing down to share an astonished look with her.Several seconds passed. Umbridge seemed too shocked to do anything, just stared up at McGonagall in fear and shock. McGonagall inhaled a shaky breath, turning away from the cowering, red faced Delores to look at Dahlia. "50 points to Gryffindor."Umbridge's head shot up, and Dahlia's jaw dropped in shock."No!" Umbridge protested loudly, nearly screaming."50 points for defending yourself successfully against your attacker.""How dare-""50 points for casting a nonverbal spell," McGonagall clearly wasn't done. Her words were causing Umbridge's face to morph into a look of pure hatred, her voice raising to cover the sound of Umbridge's protests."You reward her-""Yes, Delores!" Minerva snapped, whirling around to glare at the smaller witch, "I am rewarding her, and if you would shut it I could bloody well get on with it!"Even Malfoy was struggling to contain his laughter as McGonagall huffed at Umbridge, taking a moment to smooth her hair into place before turning back around to face her students. Dumbledore's eyes were sparkling, though his expression revealed nothing. He watched the interaction in front of him with twinkling eyes, his lips twitching upwards in a smile, though he remained silent."50 points for casting a wandless, nonverbal spell." Minerva shot a withering gaze at Umbridge over her shoulder. "Such magic is beyond even some NEWT level classes; only Aurors are trained on it."Dahlia broke out into a huge grin, heart elated at her victory. Umbridge's jaw opened and closed several times before closing decidedly with a snap, snorting furiously."Brilliant!" Dahlia beamed up at her head of house. "May I be excused?""Yes, I'll walk with you." McGonagall motioned for Dahlia to exit, the door magically swinging open. "Mr. Malfoy, you remain here. They have further business with you."Dahlia started, having completely forgotten Malfoy was present for the whole ordeal. She stole a glance at him, questioning his reasons for being summoned. He returned her gaze, though Malfoy gave nothing away. Dahlia was forced to leave, feeling his gaze follower as she walked past him and out the door, McGonagall on her heels.The moment the door shut behind them Dahlia dissolved into a fit of laughter, unable to hold it in any longer. She wrapped her arms around her waist, howling as she nearly collapsed on the floor. "I thought you were going to hex her, professor!" Dahlia gasped in between giggles, looking up at her head of house with admiration. "'Either charm would have protected you from that, Delores!'" Dahlia wiped tears from her eyes, struggling to regain her balance. "Brilliant."McGonagall cracked a rare smile, hiding it behind her hand. Her eyes were twinkling, giving away her mirth. "I suppose I did lose it a bit, didn't I?"_After parting ways with McGonagall Dahlia made her way directly to the seventh floor as Harry had asked. She was now pacing the abandoned corridor, scanning each corner for any sign of him. Harry had said to meet him here after her meeting, but he was nowhere to be seen. Fidgeting, Dahlia checked her watch for the 3rd time, walking past the mural to Helga Hufflepuff for the fifth time. She huffed impatiently; where was he?As if hearing the summons, Dahlia felt a tap on her shoulder. She spun around, but found no one there. She gasped slightly, throwing a hand out, searching for any unseen person. There was a strange magic in the air, almost a familiar tingle. "Who's there?" She gasped, swinging around in a full circle, eyes scanning the seemingly empty hallway. "Harry?" Dahlia's voice was a nervous whisper, her wand sliding into her hand."Get under the cloak!" Harry's voice whispered back. The corridor before her rippled until a hand appeared out of nowhere and jerked her forward. Dahlia fell forward and found herself underneath an Invisibility Cloak with Harry. The material appeared to be a dark green from within, tiny magical runes embroidered into the fabric.Dahlia gaped for a second, shocked by the size and beauty of the Cloak. The material dragged the floor around them, covering their feet efficiently. She stole a glance at Harry, finding him studying her with an amused smile on his face. "You have an invisibility Cloak?!" she gasped, smacking his shoulder gently.Harry winced, shrugging modestly. "Yeah... Moody -er, Crouch Jr., confiscated it last year so I didn't get much use out of it.""This is amazing," Dahlia breathed, examining the fabric. It felt lighter than air, smooth like silk. She turned to face Harry, a curious look on her face. "So, why are we here?""I need your help," Harry admitted, looking sheepish."With what?" He wasn't one to ask for help.Harry hesitated before turning so he could look directly at her. "How much wandless magic do you know?"Dahlia bit the inside of her cheek, hesitating. She hadn't anticipated his question, "I- I...""I don't mean to pry," Harry said softly, looking at her with pleading eyes. Dahlia swallowed, suddenly nervous. There was so much she wanted to tell him, but she knew she couldn't. She probably couldn't even answer his question honestly. "I don't mean to pry, Dahlia, but I saw you in the graveyard."Dahlia physically winced. Harry noticed her reaction and rushed on. "You took out Death Eaters without a wand. You literally blew up the entire graveyard." Harry hesitated, clearly trying to judge her reaction. "I thought maybe it was an emotional reaction - like an adrenaline rush but with magic. It was life or death. But with Umbridge..." His voice trailed off into nothing, suggestive and hesitant."What's your question, Harry?" Dahlia needed to know what he was getting at, voice sharp and to the point."Can you control your wandless magic?" His word were rushed, forced.Exhaling, Dahlia nodded warily. She couldn't deny what he had seen - nor did she want to lie. "Yes, sometimes."Harry gave a short nod, processing her words calmly. "Okay. I need your help.""With what?" Dahlia asked a little shortly. She was getting tired of the confusing mystery, looking darkly at him."We started a club."Dahlia's eyebrows wrinkled; that hadn't been where she thought he was going. A thousand possibilities swirling around in her head, and a club hadn't made the list. "A club?""Yeah," Harry nodded eagerly, unable to contain his excitement. "Except it's a secret, and we practice dueling. Umbridge isn't preparing anyone for the war that's coming, so we decided to teach ourselves."Dahlia's eyes flew open wide, suddenly on board. He was talking of training - practicing, dueling, true Defense Against the Dark Arts. "Like a defense club?""Yeah!""That's brilliant!" Dahlia clapped her hands, face lighting up. "So, who runs it?""Well..." Harry said slowly, suddenly hesitant, "technically, me.""Really?" Dahlia seemed surprised, giving him an impressed look. 'How do I join?""I don't want you to join," Harry admitted, shooting her a look. Dahlia looked offended for a moment, anger flashing in her eyes. Her nose wrinkled, brow furrowing as she spoke slowly, voice threatening."Harry Potter, if this is that protect me bullshit again, I swear on Merlin's beard I'll-""I want you to lead it with me." He interrupted her quickly, as though if he said the words fast enough she wouldn't understand what he had said. The words she had been about to say were ripped from her mouth as she stared in shock at her friend."Lead it?""Other than me, you're the only one who has the same experience." Harry said softly, trying to avoid mentioning the graveyard. "You and I have fought actual duels before. No one else has, so I've been training them.""Who's them?"Harry shrugged. "It started as a few people. Mainly Hermione, Neville, Ron, the twins and Ginny, of course. Then about a month ago it kind of started growing."Dahlia raised her brow, questioning him. "So...?"Harry hesitated before speaking. "Why don't I just show you?" Harry led her in front of a blank wall, staring at the blank stones. It took Dahlia a moment to realize what Harry meant. Her heart dropped down to her stomach as she stared at the entrance to her old room. Harry had found the Room of Requirement. Her hands got clammy as she looked at the wall that separated her from her childhood prison, the entrance door forming before her eyes. She swallowed nervously, unable to look away, dreading the moment she'd have to reenter that door."You meet in the Room of Requirement?" Her voice was raspy, dry.Harry looked surprised she knew what was behind the wall. "I- yeah, how'd you know about it?"Dahlia shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant even as the bile rose in her throat. "I learned the secrets about this room a long time ago.""Oh," Harry seemed slightly off-put but offered her a kind smile, gracious as always. "Maybe you can help us with it; sometimes it's hard to get it to give us exactly what we need.""I'll show you," Dahlia said dismissively as the door solidified in front of them. Harry glanced around the hallway once more to ensure they were alone before opening the door and holding it for her.Dahlia stepped through after a moment's hesitation, her heart racing. She'd expected to see the small room with a single bed she'd spent her life in, the old bookshelf in the corner overflowing with books, her desk crowded with parchments and notebooks. She was pleasantly surprised to see that the room had expanded to thirty times that size. Dahlia stifled a gasp as she looked at the vast room. Practice dummies and targets lined the back wall, with pads and cushions. The corner had what held a medicine cabinet, probably for any injuries received during training.A shuffling sound drew her attention, and she turned to face the large group of people in the middle of the room. Harry pushed ahead of her, and Dahlia was all too happy to linger behind him as they approached the group of people."Everyone, I've brought Dahlia in to help me teach."Dahlia managed a smile, eyes scanning the group of people before them. "Hey." There was a mix of houses - almost the entire Gryffindor house was present, with a majority of the older Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw students. She'd be willing to bet money many of the Ravenclaws had joined out of fear of failing their OWL and NEWT exams that loyalty to Harry, but she pushed the thought from her mind.Hermione and Neville stepped forward to hug her, as did several other Gryffindors. Dahlia glanced around and saw several students from other houses she recognized. Luna Lovegood was smiling a glazed smile, standing with a few older Ravenclaws and Cho Chang. Dahlia avoided Cho's eyes, not ready for the questions about Cedric to begin. As though the crowd had read her mind, a voice called out."You want the girl who killed Cedric to teach us?" A voice Dahlia didn't recognize spoke loudly."Voldemort killed Cedric!" Dahlia snapped, whirling around to try to put a face to the voice who spoke. Her voice was adamant, loud and challenging as she glared, eyes sweeping through the crowd for the student who'd spoke."If you're here, it's because you believe me and Dumbledore's story; Voldemort has returned, and war is brewing." Harry spoke firmly, but Dahlia could hear the rage in his voice, the way it wavered. "Dahlia saved my life during the maze - and in the graveyard." Harry's eyes shifted up to hers in silent thanks; she relaxed slightly, embarrassed by his gratefulness. The group around them was listening to his every word, turning reverent looks to Dahlia as Harry continued. "Dahlia is the only reason I am alive right now; that's why I want her to teach. I want the girl who avenged Cedric's death to teach, the girl who held off 10 Death Eaters alone. I want the girl who didn't hesitate to give me her wand mid duel." Harry's voice became thick with emotions as his eyes caught her. For a moment, both of them were suspended in time, reliving the horrors of that night in silence until Harry pulled them back to reality."Dahlia saved my life," Harry spoke with conviction. He spun in a circle, looking everyone in the room in the eye. "I would be dead if Dahlia hadn't been there, and Voldemort would be in power right now."The weight of his statement washed over the group, until one of the Ravenclaws spoke. "Is it true you know wandless magic?"Dahlia tore her gaze away from Harry's steady one, not sure how to answer. She knew rumors would fly after her encounter with Umbridge, but not this fast."She can!" Another voice boasted. "I watched her send Umbridge flying into the wall without a word - or a wand!"Dahlia managed a small smile, sheepishly grinning as she chuckled to herself. "I supposed I might have overdone it.""Over done it?!" The boy - a younger Ravenclaw - spun around to gape at her, "It was brilliant!"Dahlia blushed, and glanced back at Harry for support. Harry nodded encouragingly at her, so Dahlia smiled timidly, stepping forward, voice strong. "Yeah, I know some wandless magic.""Will you teach us?" Another eager Ravenclaw asked, an older student speaking this time. The crowd was latching onto Dahlia's every word, any suspicion turned to reverence. She basked in the welcome, looking around until her eyes met the sad eyes of Cho Chang. Dahlia managed to swallow, eyes gluing to her's, feeling as though her throat was closing up. Cedric had loved Cho. Cho's eyes were searching her face as though she could find the answer she'd been searching for, but Dahlia tore her gaze away, and turned back to the older Ravenclaw who had spoken to her."Yes." She'd make sure all of them could defend themselves - she'd make sure no one else died. Her jaw settled into a determined line as she gazed over the tiny army. Cheers went up from the crowd as they began to break into pairs for their usual warm-up, per Harry's orders. Harry shuffled so he stood next to her, watching as the students before them organized themselves."What do you call this club anyways?" Dahlia asked curiously, watching the warm up duels with interest.Harry smirked, shooting her an amused look. "Dumbledore's Army.""That's...Brilliant."

Her first official meeting as co-leader of Dumbledore's army was two nights later. Dahlia had been pleasantly surprised at the progress Harry had made with Dumbledore's Army. The group had mastered many offensive and defensive spells, impressing Dahlia with their spell work. Currently they were working on Patronuses, with no one having been able to create a corporeal patronus yet. Harry had been kind enough to move the meeting back an hour from their usual time so she could attend after Umbridge's detention - something she found she must attend, no matter how much she and Minerva agreed it was uncalled for. Dahlia had learned after her first night of detention last night that Umbridge was more cruel and manipulative than originally thought. When Dahlia had arrived at detention in Umbridge's office, she had been expecting to do tedious manual labor or cleaning. She hadn't expected to be writing lines - she'd actually been pleasantly surprised by the mild punishment, until Dahlia wrote the first sentence. "I must not tell lies"The excruciating pain had ripped through her left hand seconds after writing the first few words. It started as feeling like a bee sting, gradually escalating to feeling as though her hand was engulfed in fire. As soon as the red ink dried, a moment of relief came as her skin began to try to heal, but the words she wrote were now etched onto the back of her left hand.Dahlia almost dropped the quill when she realized the ink was red because she was writing in her own blood. She forced herself to swallow, her left hand curling into a fist as anger erupted in her. She met Umbridge's haughty gaze with a defiant one of her own, refusing to show even the slightest bit of weakness in front of the vile woman.Umbridge wasn't the only sadistic one.Dahlia gave no indication of the pain in her hand as she spoke. "Again, professor?" Dahlia tried to match the sweet venom Umbridge laced her own voice with.The smirk slid off Umbridge's face as she snapped. "Yes!"And it continued for an hour. Dahlia refused to show any sign of pain, always simply asking Umbridge "Again?" after completing each line. Umbridge grew more flustered with each line, until finally detention was over and Dahlia was released, her hand cracked and bleeding with the words etched in her skin. Her hand felt as though it was on fire, even after the horrid quill was put away and she was free of detention.She'd been scurrying quickly to get herself to Gryffindor Tower when she bumped into the Weasley twins. Dahlia ignored them, brushing off their apologies as she tried to hurry to her dorm so she could tend to her bleeding hand."Oi! Dahlia!" One called after her as she continued to hurry away, footsteps following after her. Dahlia groaned as she paused, tucking her left hand behind her back as she turned to greet the twins."Hey!" Her voice sounded weak, even to her, the smile she plastered onto her face strained."What's happened?" George asked curiously as him and Fred stopped in front of her. They were eyeing her suspiciously."What's behind your back?" Fred asked immediately after, giving her an impish look as he craned his neck in an attempt to see behind her back."Nothing," Dahlia hastily showed the twins her palms, careful to keep the still bloody back of her left hand facing her. She'd wiped the blood on the hem of her shirt, no evidence apparent on her palms.The twins looked at her curiously before a crease formed in Fred's brow. "Turn your hands around," Fred ordered, his voice suddenly void of amusement. He shared a knowing look with George, and Dahlia knew she was caught.Dahlia bucked immediately, shaking her head as she quickly tucked her left hand behind her back again. "No!""Did you just come from Umbridge's office?" George's voice was serious, all tones of merriment gone. Fred was looking at Dahlia intently, the somberness in his gaze forcing the truth from her.Heaving, Dahlia rolled her eyes. It was apparent they were already familiar with Umbridge's detentions, so hiding it would do nothing. "Yes, fine." She flipped her hand around, drawing it from behind her back, revealing the mangled, bloody back."Bloody hell!" Fred gingerly rook her hand in his to inspect it, flinching at the wangled mess. Blood was steadily oozing from it, the muscle and tendons visible underneath the lines she'd embedded."Easy!" Dahlia winced, instinctively tensing away from Fred's touch. His hands immediately gentled as he apologized, taking more care not to move her fingers as he stared at her hand."What d'you think, Georgie?" Fred passed Dahlia's injured hand to his twin who inspected it at eye level, seeming apprehensive."Might be pushing it, Freddy," George sounded skeptical as he observed the broken skin, the deepness of the cuts.Dahlia's interest was piqued. She glanced curiously between the twins who seemed to be having a silent telepathic conversation. Several long moments passed before Fred finally shrugged. "Only one way to find out."George shrugged in agreement, releasing Dahlia's hand. "Supposed it can't hurt."Fred began digging around his shoulder bag until he produced a vial. Dahlia looked at the clear, light pink liquid for a moment before shaking her head firmly, taking a step back. "That looks like a love potion."Beauxbatons had taught her to be wary of any potion handed to her, even from friends. She was in no hurry to make that mistake again, especially with the twin's reputation for pranks."Ha!" George snorted, while Fred burst into laughter. They shared an incredulous look, laughing hysterically at her words."She thinks we need a love potion to make her fall in love with us?" George asked incredulously, laughing so hard he teared up. Fred joined him, smacking his arm in merriment."This, love," Fred reached into his bag of wonders and withdrew another vial, though this one was sealed in a labeled bottle, and the liquid was red. Fred tossed the red love potion to Dahlia; she caught it gingerly. After a suspicious glance at the twins she lifted up the Love Potion to her eyes, reading the label. "If this is the Amortencia, what's in that vial?"She found she didn't have the courage to ask them why they traveled with Love Potions on their persons, if they supposedly didn't need it."Take it and find out," Fred said with a smirk as he tossed her the other vial. Dahlia hesitated before looking towards Fred. He gave her an encouraging grin, snatching the Love Potion deftly out of her hand. She hesitated for a moment, remembering the last time she'd made such a mistake. This was Fred and George though - Ron's brothers. They wouldn't dose her with anything dangerous.Dahlia glanced at her burning, mangled hand before glancing back at the pink liquid. "Oh, what the hell." Dahlia undid the stopper and tossed the vial back like a shot. The liquid burned her throat slightly, almost like alcohol. The twins watched her reaction curiously, almost studiously."Well, feel anything?" George asked after several long seconds."What am I supposed to feel?" Dahlia asked, wiggling her fingers in inspection, glancing warily at the boys. She found herself regretting not asking more in depth questions prior to drinking the solution."I dunno, like -""Oh!"Dahlia's exclamation silenced the Weasleys who started at her outburst. Dahlia's attention snapped to her hand, the twins gaze following hers. A soft light was emitting from it, and she watched as the small specks of light began to stitch her skin back together. The light created a warmth in her hand that was surprisingly comforting, painlessly sewing up the cuts in her skin. A few seconds later the light dimmed, and a few seconds after that it was gone all together, leaving her hand pain free and completely healed."Bloody hell.""It worked!" The twins spoke simultaneously in awe, matching grins on their faces.Dahlia was staring at her hand in amazement, flexing her fingers as though she thought it was an illusion. Her skin was magically repaired - pink and new, but whole once again."Merlin's Beard..." Dahlia stared at the twins in amazement before throwing an arm around both of their necks, pulling them into a group hug. "That - that was amazing!"The twins awkwardly hugged her back for a moment before she pulled away, beaming up at them. "What the hell was that?""Something we invented," Fred's face was beaming, hand lingering on her waist."Really?!" Dahlia looked impressed, taking a full step back as they started to make their way down the corridor."While developing our products for Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes, we occasionally had some... accidents? They required the invention of an immediately active healing potion.""It's brilliant!" Dahlia beamed at the twins, still flexing her now painless hand."Here," Fred reached into his bag of wonders, pulling three more identical vials and handing them to her. "For the rest of your detentions.""She seems to go harder on you," George agreed as Dahlia accepted the vials, shocked by their generosity."Th-thanks, guys," Dahlia smiled at the red heads, eyes brimming with tears. "I can pay you for them."Fred shook his head firmly as George insisted. "No!""Consider it a gift," Fred winked at her, dismissing her insistent protests. "For throwing Umbridge against a wall."Dahlia blushed at the memory, a satisfied smile on her face as she stopped protesting. She tucked the vials protectively into her pocket, giving Fred a thankful look."That was brilliant." George said approvingly, referring to the Umbridge Incident."If you thought that was good, you should have seen McGonagall hit her with a book!" Dahlia gushed, looping her arms through the twins as she steered them towards the 7th floor."Shut it!" Fred looked appalled, gaping at her in shock."McGonagall?!" George gasped, staring confoundedly at Dahlia."Oh, yes," Dahlia giggled. "Let me tell you the story."It was her fifth and final night of detention, with only a week left before exams and Christmas break. Fred and George's potions had been life-saving. Umbridge seemed determined to draw a reaction from her, strengthening the power of the curse on the quill before each detention. The cuts on her hand were deeper, more scarring each night, yet the potion always returned her hand whole and healed.Dahlia forced her feet up down the hallway to the High Inquistors office, as Umbridge was calling herself these days. She opened the door to find no one present; she resigned herself to sitting in her designated chair until Umbridge arrived. She'd barely been seated for a minute when the vile pink woman swooped in, falsetto voice chirping."Miss Dumbledore."Dahlia's back stiffened as she waited for Umbridge to continue, gritting her teeth at the mere presence of the woman."You will continue your usual detention; however, I have been called away on ministry business so one of my Inquisitorial Squad members will be over-seeing you this evening."Internally, Dahlia groaned. That most likely meant a Slytherin. Umbridge had issued a new decree, forming a group of students who assisted in enforcing her rules. To no ones surprise, the squad was compiled of mostly Slytherins who abused their power to torture members of other houses. Externally, Dahlia willed her expression to remain emotionless, determined to continue to show no sign of emotion in front of the pink hag."You may go ahead and begin," Umbridge tittered loftily. "He will be here momentarily."Gritting her teeth, Dahlia picked up the quill that was perched on the desk waiting for her. A parchment appeared before her, and she grudgingly lifted the quil. Various prompts were prepared for her to copy, and she almost snapped the quill in half as she saw the first one.You-Know-Who has not returned.Before she could begin writing, Umbridge's voice rang out again. "Ah, thank you for joining us tonight!" The door opened signaling the arrival of the Inquisitorial Squad member. She fought against her curiosity to turn and see who had arrived."My apologies," the smooth, cold voice responded. "I didn't mean to keep you waiting. "Dahlia tensed; she knew that voice. The voice that excited her and angered her at the same time. A voice she would recognize anywhere. His voice."Never mind that," Umbridge said in her sickly sweet voice. "We were just getting started.""Wonderful."Dahlia could hear the sneer in his voice, and she winced, taking a moment to appreciate that her back remained to him, giving her a moment to prepare herself. Of course Malfoy had joined the Inquisitorial Squad - he seemed to have made every other horrible decision in her absence."Miss Dumbledore already knows her task. Your job is just to ensure she remains here for the full hour... and works diligently."Dahlia kept her back to the pair, so she didn't see the mild panic that rose in his eyes at the mention of her name, the realization of who's detention he would be over seeing."I'll be leaving now," Delores said as she moved towards the door, heels click-clacking with each step. "I expect you to handle things here in my absence, Mr. Malfoy.""Of course, ma'am," Malfoy said smoothly, moving to hold the door open for the woman as she took her leave.Umbridge left without so much as a thank you. Dahlia immediately turned her attention to her prompts, picking up the quill with a sour look, and began writing. She'd chosen to skip the You-Know-Who prompt - after all, she must not tell lies.Dahlia almost hissed at the pain that electrocuted through her hand as she wrote. Umbridge had been strengthening the spell on the quill after each of her visits in an attempt to break her, but Dahlia had yet to show emotion or pain during a session, and she would not begin with Malfoy in charge.Malfoy said nothing as he sat in Umbridge's chair directly across from her, sliding in smoothly behind the desk. Dahlia could feel his eyes on her, but she decidedly ignored his presence despite the urge to speak to him. She focused on the lines in front of her, gaze burning a hole into the parchment.Dahlia ground her teeth as she continued her lines. Her rage was nearly uncontrollable; she wanted to hit him. She wanted to hit him for being awful, and never writing to her. Even more than that, she wanted to hit him for lowering himself to joining the Inquisitorial Squad and shagging skanks in hallways! Dahlia stole a look at his smug face that was studying the pink office around them, eyes lingering for only a moment before returning to her task.No, scratch that. She wanted to hex him.And then she wanted to kiss him.Dahlia almost gasped out loud at her wondering thoughts. She forced her attention back to the lines she had been subconsciously writing, the pain her hand intensifying. She'd completed the entire page, and had a stinging, bloody hand to prove it. With a shaky breath, Dahlia set the quil down to exchange prompts. She made sure to keep her face void of emotion, curling her stinging left hand into a fist on her lap beneath the desk. Malfoy ignored her, busy reading his book behind the desk to pay her any mind.Dahlia shakily picked up the quill again, staring blankly at the paper in front of her as she looked at her next prompt.I must learn to control my temper.Dahlia grit her teeth, and silently threw curses on the woman. "I'll kill her," Dahlia muttered low to herself as she braced herself to write, right hand gripping the quill in a death grip, hoping to shatter it."Quit stalling," Malfoy snapped coldly, looking up to give her a sneer.Dahlia met his gaze for the first time, defiant and angry, ready to challenge him. "I didn't realize you'd joined your fellow near sighted Slytherins and begun kissing Delores's ass!" Dahlia's hand began scribbling furiously as she spoke, eyes glued to the Slytherin across from her.Malfoy seemed unaffected by her words, rolling his eyes and closing the book he'd picked up from Delore's desk. He reached in his robe and withdrew a book - Transfiguration for the Advanced - and proceeded to ignore her.Dahlia fisted her left hand against the numbing pain now engulfing her hand, the feeling of a million needles being hammered into her hand causing her to bite down on her lip in desperate attempt to muffle the cry building in her throat. She cast a desperate look at the clock.It had only been eleven minutes.Dahlia silently cursed, but schooled her face to remain stoic. She hadn't let Umbridge see her pain, and she would be damned if she would allow Malfoy to see it.Not again.Not after... everything.Surged on by her anger, Dahlia jotted down the lines Umbridge left for her furiously, forcing herself to write at a slow and steady rate. She was pleasantly surprised to find that when she indulged in her furious, murderous thoughts the pain would decrease slightly.Not gone, just background noise. An afterthought. She planned Umbridge's death, the thousand different ways she could make the miserable bat's life hell. Dahlia lost track of time as her thoughts drifted far away from the pink hell she sat in, going to darker recesses of her mind than Umbridge's demise. There was a war brewing; one she'd unwillingly participated in. One she wasn't allowed to fight in. There was a boy she wanted, that didn't want her. A boy who was on the wrong side of the war. A boy who fucked other girls in hallways for her to see. She was lost in a time that didn't belong to her; and no one could ever know. Her heritage was horrifying; no one would look at her the same if they knew. She didn't know what she was allowed to do - or say - that wouldn't affect the timeline. She existed in an intricately designed web of lies, that threatened to crumble if she made even one false move."Dumbledore!" A loud drawl interrupted her thoughts. Dahlia jumped in surprise, her gaze snapping to Malfoy, returning to reality in the horribly pink office. Draco was looking at her like he was bored, but an under note of worry lay in his eyes. It was quickly replaced by anger, cold and calculated as he returned her glare."Yes?" Dahlia snapped, looking angrily at the boy across from her. He'd matured over the past few months; his jaw line was more defined, his cheekbones higher, giving him a haughtier, refined look she found appealing. His grey eyes were the same, his hair a little shorter, but still falling into his eye line."You've only got ten minutes to finish the last prompt." His voice jarred her from her staring, glancing at the clock in shock. Had it really been that long? The clock on the wall confirmed it, only ten minutes were left in her detention. Relief swept through her as the pain in her hand became noticeable. She pushed it from her mind, settling determinedly to do the last prompt.The moment her eyes landed on it, her stomach twisted. She'd forgotten why she had left this one for last. She glared in contempt, silently defying it. Dahlia pulled the prompt to her, swearing to write so slow she would only have to write the words twice. She refused to have this scarred on her body.You-Know-Who has not returned.The prompt glared up at her, mocking her. She bit her lip, hating the thought of those words being inscribed on her skin. Of all the things she would write, this lie was not one of them.Dahlia made the mistake of stealing a look at the Slytherin across from her, who was already watching her. His grey eyes were expectant, almost amused by her denial in the quote."Issue with the prompt, Dumbledore?"Dahlia glared at him as she braced herself to write. "So many issues." Dahlia snarled back at him, giving him one last murderous look before she started writing. A smirk grew on her face as she finished the first line, the stinging in her hand completely worth it for once.Voldemort has not returned.The mischievous glint sparked in her eye as she stared at her writing, pride filling her. At least something was on her terms. Take that, bitch. Inwardly she sang, hunching over to continue her task. Dahlia completed two more lines, and only had one remaining when Malfoy spoke. "Detentions over."Immediately Dahlia dropped the quill without a word, relieved to be done. She shoved her left hand into her pocket, smearing the blood onto her dark cloak before standing, hoping blood hadn't trickled to the ground or onto her person. She was about to leave the room when the Slytherin boy spoke again."You're not done."Dahlia turned indignantly, her throbbing hand becoming more painful by the second. She masked her pain, though it was escalating by the second. Umbridge must have added additional strengthening spells. "Detention is over, you said so yourself.""You have one line left."Dahlia snorted, spinning on her heels to stride back towards the desk. Amber eyes clashed with grey as she advanced. "Merlin forbid I disobey a member of the Inquisitorial Squad." Dahlia spat venomously, her green eyes flashing as she picked up the cursed quill."Captain," Malfoy corrected her casually with a smirk, seeming unbothered. Dahlia didn't try to hide her look of disgust as she leaned down to scribble the last line, defiantly using the Dark Lord's name again. She shook with anger, and with shock. Her mind spun as she processed his words - not only had he lowered himself to join the Inquisitorial Squad, he was their leader. Somehow that fit perfectly in her messed up world."There!" she tossed the paper at him, letting it flutter in the air until it landed on his lap. She didn't wait for him to dismiss her. She turned on her heel and strode away, the door slamming behind her.Dahlia made a beeline for the Astronomy tower, ducking into a passageway to avoid other students. She clutched her mangled hand against her chest as she scampered through the tunnel way. While she wanted to return to her dorm room, she was in no condition to see other people. Or be seen. Her cross words with Malfoy - discovering he'd truly agreed to join Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad made her almost as nauseous as the pain in her wrist. She never thought he'd lower himself to that - she hadn't thought he was like his family.Dahlia wallowed in her dark thoughts as her feet carried her up the stairs to the tower. Her breath hitched as she thought of Malfoy's behavior; no letter, not in the entire seven months. She gets back, and he's fucking other girls and joining Umbridge as though she never existed.Maybe it's better that way, Dahlia thought miserably as she continued up the stairs, quickening her pace desperately. Maybe it's better it ends like this. I'm not supposed to exist in the first place.And that's why I need to fight! Dahlia argued with herself. My life is the only one not worth anything!Dumbledore's words to not interfere echoed in her head as she burst through the door of the tower, collapsing on the ground of the tower. A strangled sob left her throat as she waved her hand through the air, summoning a bottle. "Accio Firewhiskey."A moment later the bottle came zooming through one of the tower windows, shattering the glass panes, and into Dahlia's waiting hand. She popped the stopper out, lifting the bottle to her lips. She took a swig, content to wallow in her pain and despair.Malfoy spared an annoyed look at the door Dahlia had slammed behind her. His nose wrinkled slightly in disgust of her attitude. He rejected the guilt he felt at the disappointment on her face when he'd told her he was Captain. He sneered, dismissing the feeling entirely. She'd left him - that certainly wasn't his fault. It certainly wasn't his fault she'd gotten herself into detention, and he sure as hell wasn't going to get in trouble for her not completing her prompts.Malfoy glanced through her prompts, a grunt of frustration leaving his throat as he read the last one. She'd changed the words to defy Umbridge, and while Draco commended her for her defiance, it would only get her in trouble in the long run. Choosing not to detangled the reason he cared, Malfoy waved his wand, the words changing themselves to mimic the original prompt.Malfoy growled in frustration as he pushed himself out of the chair, determined to escape the pink horror house as quickly as possible. It wasn't even his fault he was on the Inquisitorial Squad; his father had spoken to Umbridge directly when he'd heard word of her decree and volunteered Draco for the position.Malfoy made his way across the office, ready to be out of this horrid and terribly... pink... office. The meowing cat plates on the walls were driving him slowly insane, the urge to shatter them where they hung growing by the minute. As he was leaving, he noticed a few drops of blood on the ground near the chair Dahlia had been sitting in, trailing out the door."What the hell?"Malfoy pondered the drops of blood - among other things - on his way down to the dungeons. The blood didn't extend past the door, leaving Malfoy slightly curious. He pushed it from his mind - Dahlia hadn't been bleeding; he'd watched her leave. His mind settled on other thoughts - specifically Umbridge. Delores Umbridge had sanctioned a decree that allowed her to create the Inquisitorial Squad. When Lucius Malfoy heard the rumors through his extensive ministry contacts, the head of the Malfoy name wrote to Delores Umbridge himself to volunteer his son for such a position.Draco had known nothing of the plot until he had received an owl from his father, informing him of his new duties and that he was to report to the headmaster's office that evening. He hadn't expected Dahlia to be summoned to the headmaster's office at the same time, although he should have expected it since he had witnessed her alleged attack on Umbridge. He had never been more thankful to be summoned in his life as he watched, front row, as Minerva McGonagall threw a copy of Hogwarts: A History at Umbridge's face. It was the most wonderful thing he had ever witnessed.He was unpleasantly surprised once McGonagall and Dahlia left. Umbridge had gone on a ten minute rant, threatening McGonagall's job many times. Dumbledore simply smiled at the ruffled woman and offered her a cup of tea - something Draco found amusing. It appears even Dumbledore didn't care for the woman. Several minutes went by before Umbridge seemed to remember she had summoned him."Yes, Mr. Malfoy, I nearly forgot." Her voice was fixed back into its sickly sweet tone, gaze turning to him. "I have been sanctioned by the Minister to create an Inquisitorial Squad in an effort to enforce my new decrees."Malfoy kept his face emotionless as he gave a nod, heart sinking at the prospect. So this had been what his father's letter had been about. "Congratulations, ma'am.""Your father has written me extensively about you, Draco." At those words, Malfoy physically tensed, his eyes now cast downwards, away from Delores's vulture stare. He gritted his teeth at his fathers meddling - cursing himself for not anticipating this as Delores digressed. "He has volunteered you for a position in my Inquisitorial Squad, and I'm inclined to agree.""It would be an honor, Professor." Malfoy's voice remained void of emotion as he met her cold stare. He knew his duty - the expectations on him as the Malfoy heir. Whenever his father went out of his way to secure Draco a position the Slytherin boy knew better than to deny it, despite him having no desire to be ordered around by a witch who thought pink was a personality."You will be named Captain of my Inquisitorial Squad. If you have any friends you think would benefit us, have them come see me. I will hold a meeting in a few days to go over duties once we have enough members.""Of course, Professor," Malfoy nodded his head at her as he stood, assuming he would be dismissed. His stomach churned with his new title, mind spinning."Draco...""Yes?" He turned back around to face the toad. He met her gaze, the dead, emotionless eyes disturbing him, though he schooled his face not to react."Do not disappoint me, or it will be most... unpleasant."Malfoy jerked from his reverie, the memory fading from his mind, suddenly struck by the need to walk off his anger. He changed his course. He was very nearly to the Slytherin common room in the dungeons, but he decided a midnight stroll to one of the towers would be a good way to rid himself of his angry energy. As much as he hated being forced by his father into Captain of the Inquisitorial Squad, it did have its perks. He was now permitted to roam the castle at any hour; it actually was part of the job so he could catch any students wandering the corridors after hours.Surprisingly, there were no students hiding in the archways or classrooms as the Slytherin boy marched through the corridors. The emptiness left Malfoy alone with his thoughts, dark and brooding as they were. He arrived at one of the towers sooner than he thought, deciding to climb the steps to the top of the tower. His temper still not placated, he took the steps two at a time hoping to wear off his energy.He was expecting to reach an empty tower, but when he threw open the door he was shocked to find a Dahlia curled up, hands around her knees, leaning back against the wall. She was staring at him, mouth forming a perfect o as she gaped at him. Her amber eyes were glossy, curls loose and unruly around her face. She still wore her robes, though her shirt was unbuttoned lower than school regulations, her tie loose around her neck. Her shoes were forgotten, house stocking pulled up over her knees.For a moment he was too shocked to say anything, and apparently so was she. He expected her to lash out, demand he leave. He had half a mind to go ahead and leave now, when she leaned her head back against the door and laughed.The moment her laugh hit his ears, his heart wrenched in his chest. Her laugh from before had been full of joy, hope, and life. The laugh that reached his ear was sarcastic, almost haunting as though she was trying to remember what it was like to be happy. Her laugh was stripped of all joy - empty."Are you following me?" She was incredulous, almost teasing as she swung her gaze to him.Her words caught him off guard almost as much as her laugh had."No, of course not."Dahlia pushed to her feet, steadying herself on the wall. She wobbled slightly as she stood, causing Malfoy to take a hesitant step towards her. The more he looked at her, the less stable she looked. Her eyes had a slightly wild look to them, unsteady on her feet. Her face was paler than normal, left hand hidden in the folds of her cloak."Are you alright, Dumbledore?"Dahlia barked a laugh again, swaying more as she planted her hands on her hips. "I'm doing great, Malfoy. Absolutely fantastic."It wasn't just her laugh that was sarcastic. Malfoy sneered at her, looking her up and down head to toe in disdain. "What the hell happened to you, Dumbledore?"Her face fell immediately, her body turning subconsciously away from him as she averted her gaze. Malfoy waited, glaring at her intently, determined to get an answer from her. Dahlia seemed to notice his glare, because she flashed her amber eyes at him before lifting a bottle he hadn't noticed before to her lips and taking a swig."Are you bloody drunk?" The last time she'd been drunk they had been at the Yule Ball, and they'd... Malfoy shook the thought from his head. That was then, and this is now.."I'm absolutely sloshed," Dahlia admitted before taking another swig and then offering him the bottle, shaking it at him temptingly. "Care for a drink?"Malfoy shook his head firmly, fixing her with a glare. She seemed unaffected by his denial, cocking her head at him."What? Slytherin's bad boy doesn't drink?" Dahlia scoffed, lifting the bottle to her lips again as she turned to wobble away from him towards the balcony. "I didn't take you for a pussy."Draco's jaw dropped. Who was this girl and what had she done with Dahlia? Her words sparked a flame inside him that burned his pride, demanding retribution. He strode after her, becoming even with her three strides later. He snatched the bottle from her hand and turned it to read the label. Fire-whiskey. And the bottle was more than half drunk."Goddamn, Dumbledore, did you drink this all by yourself?"Dahlia shrugged, looking up to gaze at the stars, hair falling back from her face. "I suppose I did," she said with a giggle, spinning in a circle slowly.Malfoy stared at her in shock. He hadn't ever heard such a girly sound come from her lips before. He turned his gaze back to the bottle, pondering over what was happening in front of him."Well, are you gonna drink?" Her words were slurred slightly, but her eyes were still glistening with enough coherency that let him know she wasn't entirely gone. Her words issued a challenge he wouldn't back down from twice.At her prompt Malfoy lifted the bottle to his lips and chugged for several long seconds, making eye contact with her as he swallowed. He put the bottle down with a smack of his lips, a small smirk pulling at the corners of his mouth. Dahlia rolled her eyes at him, turning her back so she didn't have to face him. "Show off."Malfoy was glad she'd turned away so she didn't see him smile, pushing the cork back into the bottle."You didn't answer my question." Malfoy reminded her, eyeing her turned back. He crossed his arms, determined to squeeze an answer from herDahlia sighed, her head drooping slightly, shoulder hunching as though defensive. "A lot happened, Malfoy.""Where did you go?"Dahlia spun around, her amber eyes flashing almost red in the starlight. "Does it matter where I went? I went away, okay? What happened to you?""What do you mean?"Dahlia rolled her eyes, waving her hand as if dismissing him. Her anger was palpable, the alcohol aiding her temper, releasing her restraints. "Nothing. Forget it."That pissed him off. He lurched forward, snagging one of her wrists to spin her around, but the second his hand wrapped around hers she screamed as though shot. Malfoy recoiled instantly, dropping her wrist and looking at her as though terrorized. Dahlia was cradling her left hand against her chest, choking back sobs."Dahlia-""Don't!" Dahlia sobbed, throwing her good hand out to stop his advances. "Please. There's a vial, on the ground over there. Get it for me."Malfoy immediately went in search of the vial, finding a small one on the ground under the table. It contained a clear, soft pink liquid and a cork stopper. The clear vial had no label, no indication of the nature of its contents. He returned to Dahlia immediately, offering her the vial.Dahlia reached out to take it, but Malfoy's hand jerked away, holding it just out of her reach. "I'll give it to you when you tell me how you're hurt."Dahlia snarled, jumping forward to try to snag the vial from his unexpecting hands. "As if you don't already know!"It was Malfoy's seeker instincts that managed to keep the little minx's hands off of the vial. He held her away with his other arm, looking at her sharply. "What do you mean?""This!" Dahlia angrily shoved her left hand out, palm down. Malfoy looked down, horrified to see the mangled mess before him. Her skin had been peeled away, layer by layer until it reached the tendons. It looked like... words had been etched onto her skin. Malfoy almost dropped the vial in his surprise, recognizing the words the cuts formed in her skin. Bile rose in his throat, and he felt the burn of the firewhiskey rising.Draco instantly froze, catching her hand gently in his, examining it closely. "Who did this to you?" While his hands were gentle, his stone cold voice was not. When Dahlia looked up she saw his grey eyes cold as ice, flickering with a barely contained fury.For a moment Dahlia couldn't speak, so Malfoy prompted her again. "Dahlia. Who. Did. This?" He was seething, temper barely contained. Dahlia had to steel herself so she didn't whither under his gaze. She'd seen him angry plenty of times, but this raw fury was a new emotion to her.Dahlia looked away from his intense gaze, mumbling. "U-umbridge."Malfoy's mouth settled into a thin line, as though his suspicions had been confirmed. "How?"Dahlia risked a glance up at him, curiosity in her gaze, taken back by his anger for her. "You really don't know?"Malfoy dropped her hand, turning to pace a few feet away from her. "What is it that I don't know, Dumbledore?" He growled at her, a hand running through his slicked back hair, causing small pieces to stick up. Dahlia resisted the urge to run her fingers through it to smooth it back.Dahlia swallowed, stunned by her previous thought, as she took a step back, furthering the distance between them. "It's her detention. The lines..."Malfoy froze mid step, not moving, not breathing, not blinking. Not a muscle moved as he processed the words she'd just spoken in deadly silence. "You mean...""It's the quill." Dahlia didn't know if it was the alcohol or his apparent anger at her defense that made her speak honestly. "There's some kind of curse on it. It draws from the writer's blood, using it as ink. In return, it's like the user is carving the words he writes into the back of his own hand."Malfoy's back was to her, his hands gripping the rails to the balcony so tight his hands had gone white. "So..." his voice was shaking, his shoulders tense. "The whole time you were writing lines?""Yes," Dahlia admitted, her gaze falling to the ground."The whole hour?" Malfoy ground out, voice rigid."Yes. It's been the same, for the past weeks worth of detention."Malfoy spun around at her words, and she was shocked to see the remorse etched on his face. It was only there briefly before his face contorted in anger. "You've done this every night for a week? Slice your own hand open until it's like that?!" Malfoy gestured to her bleeding, peeled hand."Yes," Dahlia admitted, looking down. "Granted, it wasn't this bad the first night. Umbridge has been strengthening the curse in an attempt to break me.""I-I didn't know." His words were meek, regretful, seeking forgiveness.Dahlia managed a small smile. "I realize that now," she said gently."You didn't...""Show sign of pain?" Dahlia smirked, giving him a knowing glance. She lifted her head, a proud look in her eyes. "I refused to give her the satisfaction of knowing she hurt me."Malfoy strode forward until he was toe to toe with her, but Dahlia didn't look up. She focused on the ground, her injured hand still clutched to her chest. Her body quivered at his closeness; if she leaned forward, just a hair's breadth she could burry her face in his chest. A slender finger curled under her chin, gently lifting her face upwards.Dahlia closed her eyes, but allowed Malfoy to lift her head. For a moment, Dahlia debated on keeping her eyes shut, staying in the safety of darkness. The need to see him burned brighter than her fear, her eyes drooping open. His grey orbs collided with her amber ones, and Dahlia was lost. The regret shining in them took her breath away, the remorse running so deep it broke her."If I had known..." Malfoy cleared his throat, reaching to gently take her mangled hand in his larger one. "I wouldn't have made you write that last line."Dahlia managed a weak laugh, wiping the tears off of her face with her good hand, leaning into Malfoy's touch. "One line didn't make a difference, Draco." She pulled the stopper out of the vial and smiled at him. "Watch."She downed the potion like it was a shot, and then held her hand out before him as if on display. For a moment, nothing happened and Draco was looking at her like she was crazy. Then, the light appeared and began to slowly stitch and regrow the pieces of her skin together, until her hand was wrapped in new, soft pink skin."What healing potion is that?" Malfoy examined her now healed hand, awestruck. "I've never seen a quick acting healing potion like that.""The Weasley twins gave it to me." Dahlia said as she gently extracted her hand from his grasp, inspecting her fingers herself. "They invented it.""Really?" Malfoy seemed shocked by the news, as though the idea that the Weasley's could invent anything beyond prank products had escaped him."They really are geniuses, you know." She shot him an annoyed glance, loyal defender of the Weasley's.Malfoy didn't deny her, seeming unwilling to argue, and the two fell into comfortable silence before Malfoy spoke again."You never did answer where you went."Dahlia tossed him a cross look. He would be the one to ruin the moment with incessant nagging. She was tired of the questions when all she wanted to do was forget the last seven months. "I don't see why it matters, Draco."Draco bristled at her words, growling. "It matters to me."Dahlia huffed before spinning to face him, eyes flashing angrily. "You lost the right for it to matter, Draco. You lost it the moment you started fucking skanks in hallways." She spun on her heel to leave but Malfoy wasn't done arguing with her yet. He reached out and snagged her arm, jerking her back around to face him. He kept his hand around her good wrist to ensure she couldn't walk away from him, his grasp tight but not harming her."That's why you're mad?" Malfoy snarled, leering at her. "Because I fucked someone else? I didn't realize you were that petty, Dumbledore."Dahlia stiffened, meeting his furious gaze with an unyielding one of her own. "I couldn't care less who you fuck, Malfoy. Walking in on that scene was just the icing on the cake that night.""Right. That's why you just threw it in my face all these months later." Malfoy sneered, tugging her hand forward so she was forced to take a step closer to him. They were toe to toe, Malfoy having to lean over to make eye contact with her. "If I didn't know any better, I'd say someone's jealous. Did you wait for me, all those months? Is that why you're upset? Because I didn't?" His voice was sweet as honey, but sharper than a sword. His eyes flickered between rage and something deeper. Dahlia's face contorted in anger, and she laughed another sickening, mirthless laugh that sucked the oxygen from his lungs. The air around him went cold, and he got a sickening feeling that he wasn't going to get the response he'd wanted."Honestly, Malfoy, do you really have such a high opinion of yourself that you really think that we share a few kisses and it merited me waiting months to give myself to you? As if I had nothing better to do than sit there pining away after your miserable existence?" Dahlia scoffed, jerking her hand out of his grasp. Her words seemed to have shocked him, because he let her jerk her arm free, staring at her as she retreated a step, gathering her courage. "For seven months I was surrounded by beautiful french people, and you think I waited for you?" Dahlia was livid now, striding forward until she was nose to nose with Malfoy, finger jamming into his chestMalfoy seemed lost for words as he scrambled for something to say, anything to say. He was furious - white hot rage pounding through his veins. For once, however, he wasn't mad at her. So she hadn't waited. Malfoy swallowed the bile that pooled in his throat at the thought of another man touching her, at himself for caring. "Y-you were at Beauxbatons?"Dahlia snorted before tossing him a smirk as she turned and marched away, the door to the Astronomy tower slamming shut behind her.

It had been two days, and Malfoy still hadn't calmed down from his midnight conversation with Dahlia. He kept replaying her words in his mind, seeing her mangled hand in his dreams. He didn't know why it mattered, but it almost... hurt that she hadn't waited. Malfoy had reminded himself that he hadn't bothered to wait for her either, but the images of Dahlia wrapped around another man left him... empty. Until the emptiness filled with rage.The more Malfoy tried to push her from his mind, the more she seemed to infiltrate it. She'd come back so angry, and he couldn't blame her for directing some of it at him. Strangely enough, it was her anger that drew him to her more. She was a force to be reckoned with, one that he hadn't seen coming. Malfoy found himself obsessing over who could have possibly gotten her attention, but he was clueless. The more he thought about it the deeper root his anger took. His disgust with himself for caring who had touched Dahlia just fueled his anger more."You alright, mate?" Blaise's voice jerked Malfoy from his reverie. Malfoy twitched in his seat, turning to the entrance wall. He had been relaxing in the common room, reclined in a chair in the corner, on the far side of the fireplace"I'm fine," Malfoy snapped, turning to face Blaise who had just entered their common room. Blaise was a handsome boy, although his complexion was the opposite of Malfoy's. Blaise was tall, standing about 6'1". Not quite as tall as Malfoy, but taller than the others in their limited friend group. His skin was a darker tone, more caramel than anything and his hair was dark. His eyes were chocolate brown, and right now they flickered with amusement."You've been in a sour mood these last few days," Blaise noted as he took a seat opposite of Malfoy's. He folded his legs and looked at Malfoy with an almost amused smile on his face. "Care to talk about it?"Malfoy ignored him, mind reflected back on his father's most recent letter. Malfoy Sr. was demanding that Draco interrogate his fellow Slytherins for information on Dahlia. Knowing is father, Draco intending on asking only the people his father would follow up on him with, starting with Zabini, Nott, and Parkinson. "What do you know of the Dumbledore girl?""Dahlia?" Blaise lit up, smirk spreading across his face. "I've been checking her out. She threw Umbridge against a wall! I mean, she was hot before, but damn after that, I was about ready to marry her."Malfoy stomped down the anger at his friend's flirty words, hating how they sparked jealousy inside him. He snorted instead, rolling his eyes with disdain. "You're ready to marry any girl that bats half an eye at you.""He's got you there, mate." Another person stepped through the wall and into the common room. Theodore Nott made his appearance. He was the shortest of the three, although still very nearly six foot tall. He had lighter brown hair than Blaise, and was slightly stocker than the other two boys. His face blossomed to show a dimple on either cheek when he smiled, something he assured the other boys was partially responsible for the amount of women he got."Theo," Blaise motioned him over eagerly. "Malfoy was just asking me about the Dumbledore girl!""Dahlia?" Theo's eyes lit up, and he broke out into one of his famous dimple smiles. He clapped his hands, rubbing them together as he took a seat next to Blaise. "She's hot, mate. Had a front row seat when she threw Umbridge against a wall, wandless and wordless.""It was nonverbal?" Blaise looked impressed, eyebrows flying high. "Bloody hell."Malfoy nearly groaned, but suppressed the urge as he watched his friends continue to rave about Dahlia. He felt his eye begin to twitch, the headache forming as he attempted to control his temper. He had no claim to Dahlia - she'd made it clear she didn't want anything with him. He was forced to agree. Draco had almost succeeded in calming his temper when his ears tuned in to the conversation happening around him."-honestly though, you'd fuck her." Blaise was speaking to Theo who instantly agreed."Obviously, blood status be damned."Malfoy's hands started to curl into fists, face beat red - something Blaise took note of. Zabini turned slightly to smirk at Malfoy before glancing back at Theo."Malfoy wouldn't shag her, though," Blaise's eyes were twinkling as Draco's darkened, his scowl deepening. "I don't think it's cause he wouldn't want to, though. Word is she can't stand him."Theo grinned at Malfoy, who was noticeably seething. Theo ignored Draco's temper, pearing curiously at him. "What'd you do, mate? Honestly, I know you're a stickler for the blood status thing, but -""Stop. Talking." Malfoy spoke through clenched teeth. He exhaled noisily, running a hand through his normally perfect hair, mussing it in frustration. "When I asked about Dumbledore, I meant what do you know about her.""Ohhhh," Blaise tried to act innocent, ignoring the murderous looks Malfoy was shooting at him. He scratched his head, glancing nonchalantly at the glass wall."Not much," Theo admitted as he leaned back, watching the silent exchange between Blaise and Malfoy curiously. "I know she's got classes with the headmaster over Christmas break.""What?" Blaise and Malfoy both turned to look at Theo in surprise."Where'd you hear that?" Malfoy demanded, almost impressed by Theo's information. Blaise and Draco looked at Theo expectantly, waiting for his answer.Theo smirked, smuggly stewing in silence for a moment before speaking. "It honestly pays off to not be a hated Slytherin. People see you in the corridors, and they shut up about their secrets instantly. Me? Less people know me, therefore less people hate me. Makes it easy to eavesdrop.""What're her classes for?" Blaise asked curiously, face turning sour at Theo's words. "I bet it's some kind of advanced class.""She did cast a nonverbal, wandless spell," Theo pointed out. "The headmaster probably took interest in her and wants to see what else she can do.""Think about it," Blaise said softly after a moment. "If that wasn't just a one time deal, and she can control her wandless magic, that'd make her the most powerful witch of our age.""Do not speak like that," Malfoy snarled, eyes flashing. When his friends looked at him in shock he stood up, bellowing. "Her blood status is unknown; she's not that powerful." Even as he spoke he recalled the bathroom incident. She'd decimated an entire bathroom just off her emotions, but that didn't mean she had learned to control it. "We already have to deal with a MudBlood being labeled as the 'Brightest Witch of our Age'. Let's not slap a label on another one."Malfoy strode off to his dorm room, muttering obscurities that didn't reach his mate's ears."AHHHHH!" A blood curdling scream echoed through Hogwarts. Dahlia awoke with a start in a cold sweat, heart pounding. She had to get help - someone needed help. For a moment she was frozen in fear at what she'd just witnessed. The next moment, she threw her covers off, bare feet padding across the floor. She stumbled down the stairs, scampering out the portrait hole a moment later, another scream leaver her lips, desperate."Albus!" Dahlia was sprinting down the corridors, screeching at the top of her lungs, chest heaving. She'd stumbled out of the portrait to her common room a few seconds previous, and now she was barefoot, in nothing but her Gryffindor quidditch sweat pants one of the twins had given her, and a tank top, scrambling through the halls as fast as she could. "Albus!" Her desperate screams were piercing the empty castle, the urgency apparent. The cold air had no effect on her as she continued to sprint down the corridors."ALBUS!" Dahlia screamed, tears running down her cheeks, throat starting to clog with desperation. Her breath came in shallow, ragged heaves as she ignored the burning in her legs, continuing to sprint to her guardian's office with little regard for who she awakened in the process.Dahlia's panicked cries must have woken Filch because he came limping around the corner, shouting. "Student's out of bed! Student in the corridors!"Dahlia continued to run past him, not sparing him even a glance, her lungs feeling as though on fire. She blew past Filch, continuing to screech as she made her way towards the Headmaster's study. "ALBUS!" Dahlia choked back sobs as she stumbled to a stop in front of the gargoyle.The gargoyle was already shifting, revealing the headmaster in his night clothes, rushing down the stairs. "Dahlia!" Albus cried, seeing her shaking, sobbing form at the foot of the stairs. "My dear, what has happened?""S-someone is hurt!" Dahlia sobbed, throwing her arms around her guardian. The headmaster held the quaking girl close to him for a moment before pulling away from her."What has happened, Dahlia?" Her guardian's voice was grave, his shocking blue eyes searching her face for answers. He gripped her arms tightly enough to ground her, but not hurt her."I-I had a dream," Dahlia stammered, fumbling for the words she needed, choking back her sobs. "Th-there was a man. In the Ministry, but not a corridor I had ever seen. H-he looked like Fred.""This happened in a dream?" Dumbledore seemed confused, looking at her steady, searching her face for the truth. "Your nightmares -""Albus! This wasn't a normal dream!" Dahlia pushed away from him, desperation clawing back into her voice as she demanded he listen to her. "There was a man. He looked like Fred and George. He was walking down a corridor and a snake attacked him!"Dumbledore looked at the girl oddly, almost fearfully. When he didn't speak, Dahlia's voice rose to screech level, amber eyes wild."He's hurt, Albus! He might be dead!" Sobs were wracking Dahlia's voice as she pleaded with her guardian, hands gripping the front of his night robes. "You have to find him. We have to help him. There was so much blood, Albus.""Albus!" Minerva McGonagall's voice rang out from behind them, urgent and panicked. Dahlia and Albus turned to find the Transfiguration teacher also in her night clothes, escorting an extremely pale and shaky Harry towards them."Harry!" Dahlia cried out, reaching a hand out towards her friend, glancing up at her Head of House, "What happened?""Professor, Mr. Weasleys been hurt." Harry's voice was urgent, his face stained with tears. He fastened on Dumbledore, words tumbling from his mouth. "Please, professor, I saw it happen. Nagini - Voldemort's snake - it attacked him. I think he was inside the Ministry." Harry's words were broken with sobs, but his voice was heavy. Dahlia froze at his words, eyes widening in horror - he'd had the same dream?"Yes, Mr. Potter, my ward has already made me aware of the situation." Albus straightened, locking eyes with McGonagall, who shared his panicked demeanor. "It would be best if you followed me to my office."The four turned and entered the stairway to the headmaster's office. Albus was several steps ahead of everyone else, and when McGonagall entered his study with her student's in towe, Dumbledore was already issuing orders to one of his portraits. "Deliver this message: Arthur Weasley has been injured, and needs immediate attention. Send a replacement for him. Make sure he is found by the right people.""Wait -Dahlia ?" Harry turned to look at her with wide eyes, seeming to have just processed Albus's words from a minute ago. "Y-you saw it too?""Minerva, please call Mr. Filch. Have him wake Mr., Mr., Mr., and Ms. Weasley. Have him bring them straight here, do not tell them what has happened yet." The headmaster turned to address McGonagall, who left with a sharp nod of her head. He watched her leave, the door fastening behind her before the headmaster addressed the two students in front of him."I have sent a Patronus to alert Molly Weasley of Arthur's condition, although I'm certain she's already aware. That wonderful clock of hers," Dumbledore managed a small, fond smile for the unique clock that sat on Molly Weasley's mantle. "I sent immediate help to him, and he should be arriving at Saint Mungo's in a few moments."Dahlia and Harry both sagged in relief at his words, Harry dropping into a chair. Dahlia gripped the back of the chair Harry had collapsed in so tight her fingers turned white, head spinning so much she felt physically dizzy."So he's alive?" Harry's voice was weak."Yes, Harry, he is alive." Albus looked between Harry and Dahlia. "I need to hear what happened. From both of you."Harry looked up so he could catch Dahlia's gaze. "I want to know what you saw."Dahlia averted her eyes, wincing at the memory. "I-I was in a corridor. A dark one, with strange designs on the walls. I just saw the man. He had red hair. He looked so much like Fred and George and then s-suddenly something attacked him. I-I couldn't see what it was for a second, but th-then I saw the snake." Dahlia shuddered, collapsing into quiet sobs, shoulders quivering. "I-I came straight to Albus. I have nightmares, I've had them for months, but this one felt so real!"Harry stood, coming around the chair to wrap his arms around Dahlia. He pulled Dahlia to his chest before looking at the headmaster, almost angrily. Dumbledore was decidedly looking at his ward, not Harry, but Potter spoke anyways."I-I was the snake," Harry admitted gruffly, released Dahlia. She jerked away from him, eyes wide in horror."What?""In my dream," Harry said numbly, crossing his arms and closing his eyes.. "In my dream I saw it through the snake's eyes. I was the snake attacking Mr. Weasly.""Mr. Weasley..." Dahlia's face took on a look of horror, defaulting to her guardian. "This isn't just some twisted joke? This is real? That really was Fred and George's dad?"Harry nodded, voice thick as he responded bitterly. "Yes.""How is this possible?" Dahlia whispered, turning from her guardian to Harry, looking at both with quiet desperation for answers. "How did we see this happen?Dumbledore observed their conversation in silence, mulling over her question before finally speaking. "I will not lie to you and say that I have all the answers now. I do not. Right now, we need to dwell on the fact that it is a miracle you did, because if you had not Mr. Weasley would certainly be dead now."Before Harry or Dahlia could speak again, the door to the study bust open and Minerva McGonagall returned with the Weasley clan in towe. All four of them were still in their mismatched pajamas, hair mussed from sleep."What happened?" Ron was still wiping sleep from his eyes, yawning as he surveyed the room."Why're we here?" Fred seemed to be the most awake, and on guard, taking in Dahlia's pale and shaky complexion with an apprehensive look. She jerked her eyes away from him, staring determinedly at the ground, ignoring the looks she felt thrown at her."Why's Harry here?" Ginny seemed to notice Harry's presence in the room first."There's been a grave accident," Dumbledore said seriously, standing to walk around to the front of his desk. "Mr. Potter and Miss Dumbledore were witnesses.""Accident?" Ron seemed awake now, looking between Dahlia and Harry for answers. Neither would meet his eyes, leaving the boy to glare at the headmaster."What happened?" Ginny and Fred demanded, a stricken look passing over their faces."Your father has been in a terrible accident," Dumbledore began, but Harry interjected, stomping his foot in a moment of passion."No, he hasn't been in an accident. He's been attacked!""Attacked?!" All four Weasley's were on guard instantly, wands drawn. They broke out into a million questions, simultaneously, each voice louder than the next."Attacked by who?!""Is he okay?""Where is he?""How did they know about it?" Ron was pointing at Harry and Dahlia. His question seemed to silence all the other questions in the room as everyone turned their attention to Dahlia and Harry who had been silently standing to the side."You said they were witnesses?" Ginny demanded tearfully, looking to Dumbledore for confirmation."I saw it happen," Dahlia spoke hesitantly, feeling like she was on trial. "It was like a dream -""Bloody hell, you're telling me you dragged us out of bed at this ghastly hour over a dream our father was injured?" Ron was incredulous, relief washing over his face."It wasn't a dream, Ron." Harry's steely voice was quiet but strong. He stepped forward, backing Dahlia's truth with his own. "I saw it too."Fred and George looked at Harry and Dahlia in shock, eyes sliding back and forth between them. Dahlia's heart broken at the despair written on their unusually pale face. "You both saw it happen?" Fred's voice was hoarse.Dumbledore sighed, conjuring up chairs. "Why don't we have a seat, and we can start from the beginning? Tea, anyone?" with a wave of his wand, six tea cups and a pot of steaming tea appeared on the desk before him."I'll take a seat when you tell me what the hell is going on with my dad!" Ron's face was turning redder by the second, temper flaring."If you would take a seat, Mr. Weasley, I'm awaiting news of your father right now, and in the meantime, I'm sure you would like the whole story." Dumbledore's voice was cold, as if he was accustomed to dealing with angry teenagers.Once everyone had begrudgingly taken their seats, Dumbledore gestured for Dahlia to start with her story. All eyes instantly locked on her, and Dahlia squirmed uncomfortably as she took a deep breath, masking the horrid details as she spoke."It was a dream, or it felt like one. I was in a dark hallway, and there was a man walking away from me. I followed him, and then suddenly he was attacked by something. I couldn't see it at first, but then I saw the snake." Dahlia's voice got thicker as she progressed, until tears were pooling in her eyes. She turned to lock eyes with Fred as a sob escaped her chest. "The man... he looked so much like you, Fred. I tried to help, I swear I tried to help, but I couldn't get the snake to stop." Tears were freely falling down her face, and she briskly wiped them away as she tried to choke out the rest of her story. "I-I woke up, and I knew. I knew it wasn't a dream so I started screaming for Albus. I ran all the way here and then -""How'd you know it wasn't a dream?" Fred seemed to be clinging to her every word, his normally mischievous demeanor somber as his brown eyes latched onto her's.Dahlia hesitated, glancing cautiously up at her guardian before standing, hiking her sweatpants hem up to her knee, exposing her ankles. "Because of this." Dahlia lifted her sweat pants leg up slightly, just enough to show the speckles of blood that were splattered on her skin.At the blood, Fred cried out, his hands covering his pale face. His hands were shaking as he shook his head in denial. "No!"Dumbledore looked at Dahlia in shock, sweeping around the side of the desk to kneel in front of her. He inspected the blood on her legs closely, using his wand to siphon it off of her skin and into a vial."You're positive this isn't your blood?" Dumbledore's voice was harsher than normal as he inspected Dahlia for injury."Yes." Dahlia lifted her pants leg more to reveal not a scratch on herself. "I have no cuts. I was running to him when the snake attacked. I felt the blood hit me."Harry was looking at her in horror. Dahlia avoided his gaze, shame filling her features. "I-I'm so sorry," Dahlia choked back a sob as she approached the twins, praying they wouldn't hate her. "I tried to help him, but it was like the snake knew I was there. I couldn't -" Dahlia's voice broke as her voice shook with sobs. "Th-there was so much blood. And then I woke up so I came straight to Dumbledore."George's shoulder's were shaking with silent sobs, but Fred sat stoic, his face unreadable. Ginny's face was streaked with tears, although she hadn't made a sound, eyes glued to Dahlia."I was the snake," Harry whispered again, not meeting any of Weasley's eyes. The four of them snapped their attention to him at his words, eyes bugging."Wh-what?" It took a moment for the words to be processed."In my dream, I was the snake." Harry's voice broke as he tried to contain his emotions, glancing up to finally meet Ron's eyes. "I-I saw it through the snake's eyes.""Did you see Dahlia?" This was the first time Albus had spoken directly to Harry. Harry glanced to him out of habit, Albus jerking his gaze away the moment Harry made eye contact with."N-no," Harry shook his head, hating the feeling that even the headmaster couldn't look at him right now. Harry glanced apologetically at the Weasley's, "I'm so sorry," he choked out at Ron specifically. "I would never hurt your dad, ever. I -""Mate, no one think you're the one who attacked dad." Ron cut him off with a sharp tone, looking at Harry as though he'd gone mental. "You weren't even there; you were in your bed.""Dahlia was in her bed, yet she somehow got blood on her!" Harry's unusual furious outburst stunned everyone for a moment. Dahlia blushed, embarrassed by his call-out as she had no idea how it had happened. For a moment no one spoke, and then Ginny cleared her throat."Don't be stupid, Harry," Ginny's voice was strained, but honest. "You'd never hurt dad; all of us know it. If you hadn't been there; seen - I mean dreamed - or whatever it is you did, dad would be dead."The twins nodded solemnly in agreement. "We don't blame you, Harry.""Send this off to St. Mungos," Dumbledore broke the tension as he handed the vial of blood he had siphoned off of Dahlia's leg to his phoenix. "Ensure that they test it to see who's blood it belongs to. If it comes back as Arthur Weasley, I need the full report."Fox disappeared in a bright light."So what happens now?" Ginny asked weakly, looking around at her brothers who were trying to hold it together. Ron was awkwardly patting her shoulder, but Ginny felt it was more for his comfort than hers. Fred and George were gripping the backs of chairs tightly, trying to appear unworried."As soon as I receive word about your father's condition, I will arrange transport for all the Weasley's to a safe location. Your mother will meet you there, and you will await further notice on your father.""What about Harry?""And Dahlia?" The twins spoke almost simultaneously.Albus hesitated, "I hadn't realized you would want them to accompany -""Want them to?" Ginny's face flushed red at Albus's thoughtlessness. "Harry's practically family! He spends every summer with us. He has to come.""Dahlia too," Fred spoke out. His gaze locked onto Dahlia's and for a moment Dahlia saw the torment of despair behind his eyes. "They saved dad."To Dahlia's surprise, his statement got a nod from all the Weasley siblings."If... if they hadn't had the dream, would our dad be dead?" Ron's voice sounded almost inhuman, haunting and weak like a ghosts."Yes," Dumbledore said after a moment's silence."They come." Ron's voice was final, clipped and not open for arguments. "You're family, Harry," Ron said firmly, looking at Dumbledore as though daring him to deny it."You're family now too, Dahlia," Fred said with a weak smile, glancing her direction.Before Harry or Dahlia could express their gratitude, a silvery patronus in the form of a Rabbit appeared.Arthur at St. Mungos in critical condition. Gone to be with him. Tell kids I will update when I can. Bill and Charlie already alerted and are apparating to Mungos."He's still alive," Harry breathed a sigh of relief. Dahlia staggered backwards, suddenly dizzy. He was alive. Mr. Weasley was alive. A strong pair of arms wrapped around her waist just as Dahlia's knees gave out, the world edging with darkness."Breathe, Dahlia," Fred's voice whispered in her ear as he shuffled them over to a chair, fully supporting her weight. He sat, pulling Dahlia down into the chair with him. Dahlia clung to him for a moment, her eyes squeezed shut, arms sliding around his neck. Images of another boy's body, feelings of another person's blood on her clawed their way to the front of her mind, bile rising in her throat, panic swelling in her soul. Dahlia stifled a whimper, burrowing deeper into Fred's chest, focusing on her guardian's voice."Since that's settled, I will arrange a port key for all of you. If there is anything you would like to go pack up, I don't imagine you will be returning here before the end of the term.""What about exams?" Dahlia blushed at the question she'd blurted out as everyone else turned incredulously at her."You're thinking about exams right now?" Harry sounded flabbergasted.Dumbledore managed a small smile. "Reminds me of Miss Granger, as I'm sure that would have been her first question as well. The seven of you will be permitted to take your exams from home, with a parent or guardian proctoring it for you.""Seven of us?" Ginny spoke, turning slowly around the room as she counted heads. "There's only six of us, professor.""I'm sure Miss Granger will not take kindly to all six of you abandoning her four days before the end of term. Best you head back to your dormitories now so as to pack. I will send the portkey down to you momentarily.""R-right. Thank you, professor," Ron mumbled as he shuffled to follow the twins out of the door to the study. Fred wrapped an arm around Dahlia's waist as they descended the stairs, Ginny slowing to walk with Harry. Ron and George left the room in silence, minds caught up in their own thoughts. Everyone paused when Dumbledore's voice echoed after them."Please, let's keep the details of this to ourselves for now - too much is unknown."

Hermione was disgruntled at the abrupt awakening she got. Both Dahlia and Ginny had run into the room, casting the lights on and desperately packing their things. Hermione was up the instant they barged into the room. She was groggy at first, but as soon as she heard Mr. Weasley was injured she was on her feet, talking a mile a minute as Ginny tried to explain what had happened. Dahlia was still pale, her hands visibly shaky as she started throwing clothes into her trunk. She was still running off adrenaline from her dream - if she closed her eyes she could replay it in her mind. Dahlia tried to bring her mind back to the present by tuning into Ginny and Hermione's conversation."So, Harry and Dahlia were together -" Hermione wasn't getting it, though she had mimicked their actions and started packing a trunk, responding to their urgency."No, no, no, Harry and Dahlia dreamt it." Ginny's impatiently snapped, huffing indignantly.Hermione stopped throwing clothes into her trunk to whirl around. Her normally controlled mane of hair was frizzy, piled inches higher than normal on her head, eyes wide as she swung her gaze to Dahlia. "You dreamt it?""Yes, keep up, 'Mione." Ginny started shoving books into her trunk, pausing to glance between Hermione and Dahlia before continuing. Dahlia was frozen in place, unable to speak a word as the horrors continued to replay in her head. Sirius's scream when Voldemort tortured him rang in her mind as though on a loop."Harry and Dahlia had the same dream?" Hermione turned back to Ginny when she got no answer from Dahlia."Similar, yes," Ginny chanced a glance at Dahlia, who ignored her completely, jerkily resuming her packing. Dahlia winced at Hermione's question; they'd been in the same place, but it certainly hadn't been the same."Both of them saw your dad get attacked?""Yes.""Your father is alive?""As far as we know."Hermione tackled Ginny in a hug, "Merlin, Ginny, I'm so sorry I was asleep."Hermione released Ginny after a moment and turned to Dahlia, brushing a tear from her cheek as she approached her roommate. "I'm sorry I didn't hear you screaming. Normally in your nightmares you scream and I can make some noise to wake you -""You know about my nightmares?" Dahlia turned around for the first time to face the other two girls in the dormitory. Her eyes wide, taken back, her surprise was apparent."Y-yeah," Hermione admitted sheepishly. "S-sometimes you scream things, in your sleep.""I used to hear you, y'know." Ginny added, tossing a minuscule smile in Dahlia's direction. "My dorm's directly beneath yours.""U-used to?" Dahlia looked questioningly at Ginny. Her nightmares had most definitely not stopped - if anything they'd multiplied in number. Had she stopped screaming over time?"I-I started to cast a muffliato around our beds after you went to sleep," Hermione whispered, casting an apologetic glance at Dahlia. "Some of the things you say... I didn't think you wanted other people to hear them. I wouldn't have intruded myself except I was worried that you wouldn't wake yourself up, so I expanded the Muffliato so I could hear you if you ever needed me to -""Thank you," Dahlia's eyes were watering as she threw her arms around Hermione's shoulders, gratitude swelling inside her. Her shoulders shook with the thoughtfulness as she choked by a cry. "I'm sorry I wake you.""You don't wake me," Hermione whispered, clinging to Dahlia, patting her back reassuringly. The girls broke apart, sharing a watery smile. "You aren't the only one who has nightmares.""Sorry to intrude," One of the boy's voices called up the stairs, footsteps falling nearby as one climbed the stairs. "But we figured we'd see if you needed any help with your trunks.""Come up," Ginny called back, quickly throwing last minute items in Dahlia's trunk before snapping it shut. A moment later the twins stomped through the door, glancing somberly at the girls."Port key leaves in five minutes.""Where's it taking us to?" Ginny asked curiously as the twins each grabbed a trunk. Dahlia made to grab her own, but Fred shook his head. He magically charmed the trunk to follow them down the stairs, gesturing her and Ginny down first."You'll see," was all the reply she got as the five of them trudged down the stairs. Ron and Harry were already waiting downstairs with their trunks. Hedwig's cage was resting on the edge of Harry's trunk, but it was empty. Dahlia raised a questioning brow at Harry about it. He shrugged, "Hedwig prefers to meet us there."The remaining last minutes ticked by in silence as the seven of them stood in a circle, hands clasping their trunks."Everyone grab hold," Fred said as he put his hand out in the middle of the circle. In his hand he was holding a silver picture frame. Everyone grabbed hold of the frame, looking to Fred as he counted down the seconds."3...2...1... Hang on tight!"They were lifted into the air in a bright light, spinning around in a circle as they became encased in a magical cloudy tunnel. The world around them spun at dizzying speeds spun it righted, their feet landing on solid ground.Everyone stumbled at the force of impact, tripping over each other and the baggage they'd brought with them. It was a tangle of limbs and loud yells as Ron stepped on one of the twin's faces, who promptly responded by shoving him so hard he knocked over Ginny, who gave Harry a black eye with her foot on her way down. Dahlia found herself underneath Ron after Fred shoved him, dragging Hermione down with her when she latched onto her friend for support. It was a mix of painful grunts and angry shouts until a voice rang out."What in Merlin's Beard is going on?!" A man with mangy black hair strolled casually around the corner, looking almost gleeful at the sight before him. His dark eyes twinkled as he took in the tangled situation before him, a bemused smile spreading across his face."Sirius!" Harry was on his feet instantly, stumbling over the cursing body of Ron as he half ran over to the man."Harry, my boy!" Sirius pulled Harry into a hug, almost picking him up off of his feet. "I've missed you!""I've missed you too, Sirius!" Harry's face was beaming as he pulled away from his godfather. Dahlia couldn't help but be curious; she'd heard the stories about the escape murderer Sirius Black before she'd joined classes at Hogwarts. Harry hadn't said much about it, although Hermione confessed one night that Sirius was truly Harry's godfather, and not guilty of any of the charges. Hermione'd proceeded to tell her the story of how they had met him. Dahlia recognized some of the story from when Harry had told her how he'd learn to cast a patronus - she just hadn't realized how powerful his patronus truly was until Hermione had talked to her."I see you've brought the entire clan," Sirius sounded amused as he glanced around at the pile of bodies that were slowly righting themselves, red-heads standing up."Bloody hell, Ronald!" Hermione's shrill voice rang out, shoving him off of Dahlia with a grunt."Get your leg off of me, Ron Weasley, before I jinx it off of you!" Dahlia rose to her feet, spitting hair out of her mouth, glaring down at the lanky boy. "You could have chosen any bloody place to land, and you choose to land on me?""You act as though I had a choice," Ron said crossly as he scrambled to his feet. He dusted his sweater off as he looked sheepishly up at the gleeful man before him. "Sirius! Long time no see.""Ron, Hermione, always a pleasure," Sirius grinned at them in greeting before turning to look at Dahlia with sparkling dark eyes. "And who is this lovely young lady?""That'd be Dahlia," Fred piped up from where he had finally located George underneath all the trunks."Dumbledore's ward," George's voice groaned out as Fred pulled his foot out of Hedwig's cage. "Promise me we won't ever take a portkey with this much shit again."Sirius laughed, offering his hand to Dahlia, genuine smile on his face. "Dahlia Dumbledore, I've heard so much about you. I'm Sirius Black, Harry's godfather."Dahlia blushed as she shook his hand, slightly nervous. "It's nice to meet you. It's all good things you've heard, I hope?""Brilliant things," Serious assured her, casting a mischievous wink in the twins' direction. "It sounds like the four of us have some stories to swap. I've had my fair tosses with the teachers, though I never had the pleasure of actually tossing one against a wall."Dahlia gasped, spinning around to growl at the twins. "You told him!?"Fred smiled sheepishly at her as George came forward to offer her a placating pat on the shoulder. "Ol' Padfoot here got into his fair share of trouble back in his day. We like to keep him updated on the under-handed works at Hogwarts."Dahlia rolled her eyes as Fred passed her to embrace Sirius. "Bloody boys," she grumbled as she grabbed her trunk."Has there been any word?" Ginny was the first to ask, and instantly the energy in the room shifted. The laughter disappeared as though sucked away, everyone tensing up; preparing for the worst."No," Sirius shook his head sorrowfully. "I'm sorry. Molly sent a patronus over an hour ago letting me know you lot would be arriving and to expect her, Bill, and Charlie at some point in the day."No one released the breath they were collectively holding. Rather, a grim sense of determination settled over the group, everyone exchanging glances"We've got to go to St. Mungo's." George looked at Fred who was nodding in agreement."We've got to go see dad." Fred agreed, looking at Ron as though for confirmation."Let's go," Ron returned the look."We can't leave mom there alone," Ginny's voice shook, but she nodded determinedly, looking fierce at her older brothers; waiting for a plan."No, leaving is the worst thing you can do. Your father arrived at St. Mungo's less than thirty minutes ago. He was alive when he got there. If the seven of you go barging into St. Mungo's mere minutes after your mother it will be quite clear that you knew what had happened beforehand." Sirius's voice was the voice of reason. "That would result in some difficult questions that we cannot answer at the moment."The Weasley boys exchanged glances before letting out a sigh of defeat and collapsing into chairs around the kitchen table. Dahlia and Harry shared a dark look before slumping into chairs across from them. Hermione leaned against a counter, twisting a tendril of hair around her finger - her nervous tick."Where are we, anyway?" Fred looked around the decrepit kitchen, taking in the sullenness. Everything was black - the counters, the floors, the pain on the walls, the cabinets. It was as though someone had taken to the color like it was a personality trait. The kitchen was large - fitting a full sized dining room table comfortably."Welcome to my home," Sirius's voice was dull as he scowled at the decor around them. "Number 12 Grimmauld Place, Black Family Residence, and home to the Order of the Phoenix."Dahlia did a double take, turning to look at Sirius in shock. "This is the Black Manor?"Serious shrugged, nose wrinkling. "Basically, yes. For some reason my mother never fancied an actual Manor with grounds; she liked the city, you see. So this townhome has been magically hidden and resized to home the Black Family for nearly six generations.""So the original Black library would be here?" Dahlia's voice was eager, almost giddy. Hermione's ears also perked up at the mention of a library, gaze tuning into Sirius's next words closely."Yes..." Sirius looked curiously at Dahlia, arms crossed. "What of it?""I need -" Dahlia blushed, remembering her conversation with Dumbledore. She mustn't tell anyone. Dahlia cut the words short on her lips, glancing around the table to find everyone looking at her curiously. "Never mind."Serious shot her a we aren't finished look before turning his attention to Harry. "Why don't I show you lot where your rooms are?"They all agreed, and stood to gather their trunks. They followed Sirius single file down the long hallways of the manor until they reached the stairs. With a flick of his wand, Sirius charmed their trunks to levitate a few inches behind them as they began to climb the stairs.They climbed several floors up before Harry's godfather started assigning rooms. "Fred and George, you'll share this room on the left. Harry, Ron, you're in the room on their right. If you push the third panel on the right side of the armoire, it turns into a passageway that links the rooms.""Brilliant!" The boys headed off to their perspective rooms as Sirius continued to walk the girls to their quarters."I didn't know if the three of you would want to share or not. If you do, there's a giant room directly across from the boys' rooms, or you can take this hallway to the end, and there's three smaller individual rooms prepared for you."Dahlia glanced hesitantly at Hermione, who responded instantly, without second thought. "Thanks, Sirius, but we actually prefer to stay together." Dahlia warmed at Hermione's words, suddenly thankful that Hermione knew about her nightmares."Good choice," Serious winked at the girls before walking them back to the room across from the boys'. He glanced around as if worried they were alone before leaning in and whispering, "If you point at the light fixture on the ceiling with your wand and say 'Import prious' it opens a passageway to the boys' rooms. It can only open from your end, though."At the girls' looks of glee and shock, Serious shook his finger at the girls in a fatherly manor. "This is not to be misinformed should you require company.""Sirius!" Hermione smacked his arm, feigning disgust at his implication, but he just grinned mischievously at them."Hey! I was sixteen once. I remember how it was." Sirius rubbed his arm as though offended, opening the door for them.Hermione decidedly ignored him as she and Ginny entered the room. Judging by their gasps of surprise, it was much bigger than originally thought. Dahlia started to follow them, but Serious stopped her with a tap on her shoulder."Thought you wanted to see the library?""I do," Dahlia said instantly, freezing in the doorway. The Hogwarts library was taking forever to get the genealogy books she'd requested. Apparently the remaining families weren't fond of releasing priceless books - but access to the Black Family Library? They were sure to have books on their ancestry - perhaps book that went back far enough for her to glean some information on her family."Follow me," Sirius gestured for her as he turned and walked back towards the stairs. Dahlia followed him after a moment's hesitation. He drifted down the stairs, sliding down the rail the last half of the floor until he landed on the ground with a thud. He'd taken them to a landing, with the door closed. "The Library is basically this entire floor."Sirius opened the doors, revealing a long hallway with doors branching out on either side. The hallway expanded at the end to a small sitting room. Instead of wall paper the walls were decorated in some kind of carpet. Faces and names, with dates underneath connected all the people together on a vine."Wait, is this your family tree?" Dahlia spun in slow circles as she stumbled down the hall, examining the various branches of the tree."Yes," Sirius's face scowled as he stared determinedly ahead. His tone was noticeably darker, as though he was hesitant to associate himself with his family."Does it show only Black relatives, or does it go further back than that?" She ignored his bothered tone, fascinated by the wall around her.Sirius turned to give Dahlia a strange look over his shoulder as the approached the sitting area at the end of the hallway. "Why don't you just say what you've been wanting to say, except stop beating around the bush about it."Dahlia blushed at his blunt words, fumbling slightly. "I'm not supposed to speak of it to anyone. Dumbledore forbade it. It's rather bizarre, really."Sirius cracked a small smile, tossing her an amused glance. "Trust me when I say, I'm the best person to come to with something bizarre. I've spent almost 13 years shifting between human and dog state, trapped in Azkaban after being framed by one of my best friends for murdering my other best friend."Dahlia seemed to take in his words being conceding - his story did sound bizarre, no matter who told it. If Dumbledore trusted this man enough to run the Order from his home, then he must be some degree of trustworthy. Perhaps this man could be trusted with a nugget of her truth. "I need your Black Genealogy Record."Sirius seemed surprised by her request, leaning against a wall as he cocked his head at her. "That's rather dull reading, isn't it?""I'm looking for any mention of the Peverells." Dahlia tried to sound nonchalant about it as she turned to study the names on the wall. She noticed a few faces had been burned out, leaving dark burn spots in their place."Like the ancient bloodline of the Peverells?""Yes.""They'd be at the beginning of the wall," Sirius pointed at the sitting area at the end of the hall, lining the wall behind the small sitting chairs. "If they're even there at all, that is. Legend has it that the Peverell's were one of the original families.""Original families? You mean the Pureblood families?" Dahlia knew of the Sacred 28 families in England. Her extensive research had branded the names permanently - many of whom she'd attempted to contact while researching her family.Sirius shook his head as he watched her walk down the hallway. "No, the Sacred 28 families descended from the Peverells - most of them, anyways. There's a legend that the Peverell's are one of a handful of other families that started the wizarding race."Dahlia swallowed as she trailed her fingers along the wall, eager to gain as much knowledge as she could about her family, regardless of where it came from. She offered up some of her knowledge in return, hoping Sirius would continue talking. "I know there were three brothers.""Ignotus, Cadmus, and Antioch, yes." Sirius directed her attention to the top of the wall, where the vines originated from. The more Dahlia walked down the hallway, the more bloodlines and names she read that she didn't notice, the older the families the fewer prominent names."Many names and bloodlines ran out over the years, or changed." Sirius explained at her rumpled confusion. "Why're you interested in the Peverells anyways?""History of Magic class," Dahlia said automatically, saying the first thing that popped into her head."Ahh," Sirius sent her a knowing look that told her she wasn't as good of a liar as she thought she was. She ignored it, finger trailing over a burned mark in the tree."How long ago did the Peverell name die out?""About seven hundred years ago, I believe?" Sirius scratched his head, face scrunched in attempt to remember. "Give or take a century or two.""So, any remaining Peverell blood? A Peverell would be related to anyone in the 28 families?""Any remaining Peverell blood has been so polluted by other blood - magical and non magical. As for being related, I guess distantly, yes, but separated by over half a thousand years, so while theoretically you could trace it back magically if it was a strong enough blood tie, genetically you'd be an entirely different person, ancestry be damned."Dahlia made no response, just continued walking up and down the hallway examining the lineage. Serious watched her in silence for several minutes before pressing a panel and a hidden door appeared. He opened it, revealing a room with endless bookshelves. She watched curious as he strolled towards a nearby bookshelf. It was hand made, carved with intricate designs and runes. After a moment of browsing Sirius selected a book and returned to her, offering her the ancient looking text casually.Dahlia brows shot up in surprise at the book he'd offered her. She took it gingerly, albeit reverently. It was ancient, several thousand pages thick with a handbound faded leather cover. Her fingers trailed down the cover of the book before she opened it, reading the first words out loud on the opening page. "Here is recorded the honorable and prestigious line of the noble House of Black," Dahlia murmured, looking up sharply at Sirius in awe. "I'll take care of it, I promise, and I'll make sure I'm finished with it before I leave for sch-""Keep it," Sirius cut her off with a wave of his hand. At Dahlia's shocked expression he cracked a wane smile. "Seriously, I'm the last Black, and no one has read that book in a century."Dahlia gushed, clutching the book to her chest as she squealed. "Oh, thank you, Sirius! I'd requested other families' genealogy books and got shot down many times; other families just didn't reply at all! I've been trying to get my hands on one for months!"Sirius laughed at her odd excitement. "You're the only person I could think of who'd get that excited over a long-forgotten book. I don't know what you're looking for, but there's an extensive family tree in the back of that book. If the person's last name wasn't Black at some point in their life, odds are there's not much more than their name in that book. Blacks tend to be... proud. That book is probably filled with all their dark achievements.""Thanks, Sirius, you have no idea how helpful this is."Sirius tossed a wink at her as they turned to leave. After closing the door to the fourth floor behind him, Serious tossed a small golden object at Dahlia. She scrambled for it, managing to snag it in midair. Looking at what she'd caught in her hands, Dahlia realized it was a small key. She looked up quizzically at Serious."It's the key to the library. I don't know what you're looking for, but something tells me you're going to need more than just that book." Serious waved away her attempt to thank him, simply saying it wasn't a floor anyone was using anyways."Just be careful," Serious warned as he closed the Library door closed behind them. "The Blacks don't have a reputation for being, well, good wizards. There's loads of books on dark magic in there, as well some that are probably guarded by some nasty hexes.""I'll be careful. Thank you, Sirius. So much."

Dahlia had snuck away to a sitting room on the second floor she figured no one would bother looking in. It was dark, like the rest of the house. The furniture were a murky brown, either from years of misuse or intentionally. She couldn't decide - mostly she didn't care. Dahlia sat on them regardless, reverently opened the genealogy book, careful of its delicate pages as she began scanning.For a book no one had seemed interested in for a century, it was surprisingly well updated. Sirius was in it, although his name had been scratched out, and the word DISOWNED was sprawled over it in red ink. Dahlia lingered on that page for a moment, pondering what could have led to him being cast out of the Black Genealogy Record, but continued nonetheless.She found the family tree in the back of the book, and Sirius had been right. It was extensive. It showed the immediate relatives of the Black family, one of which shocked Dahlia. Narcissa Black married Lucius Abraxius Malfoy, baring him a son - Draco Lucius Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy Estate.So, Draco's mother had been a Black. That made him and Sirius... cousins? Dahlia passed over it. While it was interesting, she needed to focus on her task at hand. Dahlia finally found the roots of the ancestry tree several hundred pages later. Just as she was about to begin reading the page, the door to the room opened, and Fred walked in.Dahlia snapped the book closed with snap! Turning to give Fred a small smile, attempting to appear non suspicious. "Hey, Fred." She tried for nonchalance, though her voice sounded higher than normal even to her ears."How D'ya do that?" Fred stumbled into a chair, his words mumbled as he turned his disparaging gaze at her.Dahlia raised a brow at him questioningly, confused by his dark demeanor and his words. "How do I do what?""Tell me and George apart.""Oh," Dahlia felt slightly off. She shrugged, "Honestly, it's your eyes. Your eyes are chocolate brown; his are just a shade lighter." That, and I can feel your magic and it feels different. It was as though Fred's magic had a short leash, while George's magic was more tempered; relaxed."Oh," was all Fred said. He glanced around the dismal sitting room she'd found, nose scrunching in disgust. "What are you doing here?""Sirius found a book I'd been looking for. This seemed like a quiet place to read.""What book are you reading?" Fred looked at the huge volume on her lap. "Doesn't look like a bit of light reading."Dahlia tried to tuck the text out of sight next to her, but it was too big so she just shrugged, folding her hands protectively over the cover. "A book for my History of Magic paper over break."Fred's brows shot up, immediately detecting her lie. He gave her a mischievous wink. "I don't believe I heard ol' Professor Binns discussing a paper? I'm sure Hermione didn't either. Should I ask her?"Dahlia growled, starting forward indignantly. "Don't you dare.""Ah," Fred's eyes were twinkling now. "So, why don't you show me what you got there?"Dahlia lifted the book, showing him the cover, trying to ignore her heart pounding in her ears. She only hoped he wouldn't ask the right questions as she clearly needed to improve on her lying. "It's the Black's family record."Fred wrinkled his nose. "Why in the bloody hell would you want that?"Dahlia shrugged, averting her gaze. "I guess I'm just looking for information on anyone who might be my parents." Better to play the dead parents card than to try to lie about questions where the truth was worse than dead parents.Fred immediately looked guilty, backing off immediately much to her relief. "I'm sorry, Dahlia. I wouldn't have...""It's fine," Dahlia was relieved her awkward response had ended the subject. An uncomfortable silence overtook them, so Dahlia spoke again, hoping to turn the conversation to him. "Any word on your dad?"Fred shook his head, despair written on his face as he spoke bitterly "No, nothing."Dahlia winced, sympathy forming on her face. "I'm sorry.""Don't be," Fred said sharply, avoiding her gaze as he shook his head adamantly. "You're the only reason I have a dad right now to begin with.""That's not true," Dahlia shook her head in denial. "Harry saw -""What you and Harry saw are two very different things," Fred snarled, pushing up out of his chair to pace. His long legs ate of up the distance of the room in a few strides; he turned on his heel and walked back, hand rubbing his neck."Fred!" Dahlia exclaimed, standing up, gawking at the distraught boy in front of her.. "You don't actually blame, Harry, do you?""No!" Fred didn't sound convinced."Fred..." Dahlia walked over towards him, placing a cautious hand on his arm, turning him to face her. "Fred, what's going on?""How do you and Harry have the same dream? It doesn't make sense." Fred was agitated, running his hand through his hair as he turned to face her. "I get Harry, because he has that 'connection to Voldemort' or whatever, but how did you have that dream."Dahlia gawked at Fred, stunned. "Harry has a what?!""Connection to Voldemort. That's why Dumbledore has made him take Occlumency lessons from Snape this past term.""How'd you know about that?" Dahlia asked sharply, cutting a look over at the red head. Did he know about her scheduled Occlumency lessons?"Ron talks to us, keeps us informed. We can't look out for you trouble makers if we don't know what's going on."Dahlia's heart softened at his words, at the realization the twins kept tabs to protect everyone. True big brother. Her eyes teared up at his words, gratitude flooding for the mischievous twins."How did you have the dream?" Fred voice was begging now as he desperately tried to make sense of what had happened."I-I have a theory." Dahlia admitted, glancing hesitantly over to Fred. Fred turned expectantly, his eyes meeting hers."Okay?""Before you mentioned the whole 'Harry/Voldemort connection' thing, I was thinking about a different connection." Dahlia looked up at Fred warily. "The one me and Harry have."Fred blushed, looking away. "Oh, you and Harry...?""Wait, what?" Dahlia looked horrified, realizing where his mind had gone. She tried to back pedal. "No, no, no, wait - Merlin... fuck." Dahlia exhaled, clearly flustered. "I meant the magical bond Harry and I made during the tournament!"Fred's eyes flew open with understanding. "Oh! Sorry," he added sheepishly."Forget it. Anyways, the vow I made Harry during the tournament... I swore myself to him, that if he should fail, I would succeed.""Yeah, for the maze -""But I didn't mean just the maze." Dahlia whispered, amber eyes meeting Freds"What?" Fred looked at her sharply, suspiciously."When I made that vow to Harry, I meant that I would protect the people he loved. I meant Ron and Hermione, at the time, specifically Hermione because she was going in with us, but I wasn't specific.""So, what're you getting at?""What if Voldemort was there with your dad?" Dahlia whispered fearfully, "What if because of his connection to Harry, and Harry's lack of occluding because he was asleep caused his subconscious to join with Voldemort's.""So he would see what Voldemort saw?""Exactly," Dahlia exhaled shakily. "And then Voldemort started to attack your dad - or making a snake do it, I haven't figured out the technicalities - Harry fought it, but it was already inside his head so the vow activated. If Harry felt like he had failed in protecting someone he loved, I vowed to succeed in his place. Naturally the vow would have pulled me to him, therefore I saw what was happening, but through my own eyes. I was asleep; and I've only figured out the bare basics for occlumency, so I can't occlude in my sleep either..."Fred was looking at her, silent as he listened to her explanation. "It could make sense; I don't know much about Magical vows, but I do know that they are supposed to be specific. If you left open ties on the one you made to Harry, such as an end date for example, I don't know how you would go about amending that. My brother Bill is a cursebreaker -""I don't want to," Dahlia said instantly, shaking her head quickly. "I want to leave it as it is."Fred looked at her, a small smile on his face. "I had a feeling you'd say that."Dahlia shrugged modestly, looking away. It was odd to not be attacked over something like that for once. Malfoy would have started demanding she fix it or null the vow. Dahlia gave herself a good mental shake - there she was thinking about Draco Malfoy again."Hey," Fred said softly, causing Dahlia to look back up at him, pulling her out of her head. "I... I need to know. Was it bad?"Dahlia didn't understand his question, so he added, "my dad..?""Oh," Dahlia winced, looking anywhere but the desperate boy in front of her. "I... yes, Fred. It was bad."Fred took two steps forward and engulfed her in a hug, taking her by surprise. "I'm sorry you had to see it," he whispered into the top of her head, "but I'm glad you did."Dahlia whimpered, her arms coming up to wrap around Fred's waist, relishing the warmth. "It was horrible," Dahlia admitted, tears pooling into her eyes. "I-I got there when the snake was attacking, but he was down the hallway from me. I ran to him, but the snake -" Dahlia broke off with a sob, pulling away from Fred. "I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to know -""No," Fred said roughly, using his hand to guide her chin up, forcing her to look at him. His eyes were swimming with tears, but he held them back. "I-I need to know. I need to be... prepared."Dahlia heard the meaning behind his words. He needed to know how close to death his father had danced - if there was still the chance he wouldn't recover."If I tell you, please don't tell the others," Dahlia whispered, a single tear rolling down her cheek as she looked up at him, still in his arms. "I c-can't...""I'll have to tell George," Fred admitted, releasing her to take a step back, "only because of the twin thing. We know when the other's hiding something. I won't say anything to the others, if you don't want me to. It's probably best Ron and Ginny don't know.""Okay, but I mean Harry and Hermione too." Dahlia inhaled deeply, looking sharply at Fred. "Do you want me to tell you, or do you want me to show you?""Show me?""I learned some basic Occlumency and Legilimency. Dumbledore wanted to start training me so Harry could have someone to practice with. I read some books on it to prepare for the lessons, and got the basics down. Legilimency is easier than Occlumency.""So... you can show me your memory of it?" Fred paled slightly, clearing his throat nervously."If you don't want to, I'll understand," Dahlia murmured, suddenly regretting her decision. She realized what she was offering to show Fred, and immediately felt out of place, mentally chiding herself for even offering."No, that's better," Fred agreed, shocking Dahlia slightly. "What do I do?"Dahlia was stumped by his agreement for a moment, words taking a few seconds to form. "When I say, you're going to point your wand at my head, and say Legilimens. I'll call the dream up to the front of my mind, and it will play it.""I'll see it through your eyes?""You'll see it exactly as I saw it," Dahlia whispered, her hands shaking slightly as she took a seat on the floor. Fred took a seat next to her nervously, quickly adjusting so they were facing each other."How do I pull out of it?""I'll push you out," Dahlia said with a small smile. "Can't let you inside my head anymore than I need to.""Okay," Fred gave a jerky nod as he pulled his wand. "Ready?""W-wait," Dahlia hesitated, suddenly regretting her decision. "I have to tell you something s-so you know... before. You have to swear you won't tell anyone."The seriousness of her voice made Fred straighten up, meeting her eye fiercly. "Whatever it is, I swear whatever you say right now doesn't leave this room.""In... in my dream," Dahlia took a deep breath, coaching herself to speak the truth, "I speak to the snake.""Like, yell at it?" Fred seemed a little baffled."No," Dahlia huffed, wringing her hands in her lap. She exhaled, closing her eyes as though gathering her thoughts before opening them and looking directly at Fred. "I mean I speak parseltongue to the snake."Dahlia could tell Fred tried really hard to have no reaction, but he still winced. "You - speak to the... right. Alright, then."Dahlia closely watched him for a second before giving a jerky nod. "Alright, then." She closed her eyes, calling the dream to the front of her mind. "Go.""Legilimens!"When Dahlia opened her eyes, she was back in the hallway. Dahlia scrambled to her feet, her eyes falling on the man with red hair far down the dim hallway. Dahlia resisted the urge to shiver as her eyes adjusted to the dimmer light. She scrambled to her feet, running after the man. A head she saw something dark lurking, sensing the dark magic and danger. She opened her mouth to call out to the man, but before she could get a word out he turned slightly, and she saw his face. She almost stopped in her tracks; he looked just like Fred and George. With a horrifying scream she realized he was bleeding down the side of his face. She'd barely started running again when suddenly something attacked him, and the man fell to the ground."No!" Dahlia screamed, spurring her legs faster as she sprinted to the man. Something was attacking the man, and then darting off impossibly fast. Blood gushed from where the attacker hit him - the darkness shaded the attacker from view; she couldn't discern who it was. Dahlia could hear the man's screams of pain as the attacker lashed out again, leaving the man's arm a bloody mess."Agh!" The man's terrorized scream raised the hairs on Dahlia's neck. Blood was starting to pool around him, the scarlet liquid staining the floor. "Help!""No!" Dahlia was almost to the man, mere yards from him. "Lumos Maxima!" A ball of light erupted around them, illuminating the hallway. That's when Dahlia saw it. A giant snake, at least fourteen feet long with fangs the size of Dahlia's fingers. It lashed out again, sinking its fangs into the man's calf before darting away.The man cried out again, pushing himself away from the snake desperately, body shaking."Impedimenta!" Dahlia pointed her wand at the snake, casting the first spell that came to mind, but the spell simply bounced off, richoteting down the hallway. The snake twisted itself around the man, latching its fangs into the man's shoulder."AAGHHH!""STOP IT!" Dahlia screamed at the snake, trying to shoot a hex at the snake that wouldn't possibly hit the man. The snaked had twisted itself so tightly around the man that she had no chance of cursing the snake without possibly cursing the man. Desperately Dahlia screamed, "SSIAAHTHEETHH!! SIIAAETHET SSIETTHH!"The snake hesitated, turning its beady eyes on Dahlia, but the man's screams continued. Dahlia didn't hesitate, she raised her wand to fire a curse at the snake, taking aim for it's head. but the snake lashed out, causing Dahlia jolt backwards, slipping in the pool of blood surrounding them, and fell backwards, hitting her head.Dahlia opened her eyes to find Fred pale and shaking, his eyes wide. She was on her back on the floor, Fred curled up over her. A whimper left his throat as he recoiled away, tears cascading down his cheeks, landing on her shirt. It took her a moment to orient herself to her surroundings, to notice the quivering boy beside her."Fred..." Dahlia whispered as her own tears fell, pushing herself into a sitting position, reaching out towards Fred. "Fred, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.""What happened after?" Fred's voice was sharp as he turned his face, trying to hide his tears."I-I woke up in my bed.""And you went to Dumbledore?""Yes," Dahlia tried to offer him a small smile, hand rubbing his back comfortingly. "I ran screaming, barefoot, down the corridors. I even woke Filch."Fred's lips turned up slightly. He scooted forward and pulled her into a hug, crushing her against him. "Thank you for showing me," his voice was gruff from emotion. "I'm sorry you have something else to have nightmares about.""Bloody hell," Dahlia pushed him away, wiping her tears. "Does everyone know about my nightmares?"Fred shrugged, not the slightest bit embarrassed. "I heard you girls talking earlier. Harry has them too," Fred admitted, catching Dahlia's surprised look. "Harry dreams about the Dementors. Or Voldemort. It varies by night. Ron will wake up screaming from the Acromantualas they encountered second year." Fred offered her a comforting look. "You aren't the only one who's past haunts them.""Thanks, Fred," Dahlia said softly, gratitude for this boy filling her once again."So, you can talk to snakes, huh?"Dahlia blushed, awkwardly looking away. "Y-yeah. I can. Please, please don't tell anyone. I know it's something normally dark wizards have, but I swear, until last night I never used it. There was one time when I was little when I had a lovely chat with a Maledictus but that was the day I discovered I could speak parseltongue and since that -"Fred broke out in a bellowing laugh, interrupting her nervous chatter. "Y-you had a lovely chat with a Maledictus?" Fred doubled over laughing, causing Dahlia to wrinkle her nose at him."I don't understand what's funny," Dahlia said snidely."Y-you say th-that as though it's just having tea with a friend," Fred was wiping tears from his eyes. "Bloody hell, I needed that laugh." He turned his twinkling eyes to her. "Dahlia, I by no means think you're a dark wizard. Am I a little confused about how you can speak to them? Yeah. However, I find it absolutely charming that you had a 'lovely chat' with a deadly Maledictus."Dahlia scowled at him, looking at him apprehensively. "So, you're not upset that I can speak parseltongue?""You act as though you're the first parseltongue I've ever met," Fred rolled his eyes, pushing to his feet. "C'mon, Dahlia, you aren't that special.""Wait," Dahlia scrambled to her feet. "You know another parseltongue?"Fred's twinkling eyes locked on hers. "You do too."Dahlia's head spun, her eyes opening wide. "Who?""Who's the one you seem to constantly be around when You-Know-Who attacks?"There was a moment's pause, "Harry?" Dahlia breathed, her hand covering her mouth in surprise."Atta girl," Fred patted her on the back. "Harry opened the Chamber of Secrets and killed a basilisk during his second year. That's when he figured out he was a parseltongue."Fred looked at Dahlia's face, laughing at her incredulous look. "You should talk to him," Fred encouraged as they began to leave the sitting room, trudging up the stairs where the others were gathered. "If anyone could understand you it's him."Fred cracked himself up at his own joke, bending over and slapping his knee. "Get it? Cuz, like, no one else in centuries has spoken parseltongue?""Oh, shut it, Fred," Dahlia pushed him away and into the wall, rolling her eyes to contain her amusement.Fred sobered up, giving her a solemn look, tugging her arm back to slow her pace down. "I do have one question though...What did you say to the snake?""I commanded it to stop," Dahlia said, her shoulders slumping in defeat as she picked her pace back up. "Stupid of me to think it would listen."Fred rubbed her arm comfortingly, though she shook him off. "Why don't we go join the others? I'll make a pot of tea and we can wait for word on dad."It was hours before they heard about Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley finally sent a patronus, letting them know Arthur was now stable. He was still critical and it would be a long journey ahead of them, but he was expected to make a full recovery. Everyone sagged in relief at this news - moods and spirits lightening greatly.The days went by much faster after that. Dahlia was briefly introduced to Bill Weasley, the eldest of the Weasley children. He stopped by one night after dinner to see his siblings before departing back on his mission for Gringotts. The twins chattered on eagerly about Charlie Weasley, though Dahlia never did get to meet him. He dropped by in the middle of the night one night, waking each of his siblings in turn to say hello before heading back to Romania.Stuffing their disappointment at the dullness, everyone took advantage of their extra few days to prepare for the exams and studied. Hermione and Dahlia holed themselves up their room, coming out only to eat. Ginny studied in the kitchen, mostly, though she did join them occasionally. Harry and Ron always started their homework in the den, though after about an hour they would trudge upstairs to the girls room, asking sheepishly for help. The seven of them were able to take their final exams under Molly Weasley's watchful eye, all spread out down the Black's large kitchen table. Dahlia would admit, taking an exam under Molly Weasley's watchful eye was more stressful than the test taking itself. Five days later, once their exams were completed they were permitted to travel to St. Mungo's to visit Mr. Weasley.Their visit to Mr. Weasley was brief. While he was on the mend, he tired quickly, and most of his body was wrapped in bandages. Whatever venom had been in the snake's fangs prevented quick healing, and caused the wounds to continuously bleed.Mr. Weasley insisted on seeing Harry and Dahlia first, thanking them profusely for saving his life. Both Gryffindors felt awkward at his thanks, telling him they would have done it for anyone, but that they were glad he was okay. After them, the twins, Ron, and Ginny made an appearance while Harry and Dahlia waited outside with the oldest Weasley brother who'd returned for the weekend since his Gringotts business had come to a close."Fred told me you're a cursebreaker," Dahlia said suddenly to Bill, who seemed shocked that anyone had bothered to mention him."I am, yeah," Bill looked at her curiously. "You need a curse broken or something?"Dahlia laughed, shaking her head slightly. "No, actually, I was wondering what you knew of unspecific bonds?"Bill glanced over at her sharply, quizzical and curious. "Like, a magical bond?""Obviously, yeah," Dahlia rolled her eyes. Bill seemed hesitant to divulge information, so she leaned in towards him, lowering her voice as though telling a secret. "I took a vow to Harry during the triwizard tournament, and I think the bond didn't expire when the event was up.""Oh," Bill looked slightly relieved, hesitance falling. "Ohhhh," he turned to look at Dahlia in surprise. "Wait, like the vow Fleur took?"Dahlia nodded, winking at him at the mention of the french woman. "How is Fleur? I haven't seen her since my trip to Beauxbatons." She tried to sound casual, though she couldn't prevent the smirk that formed on her face."She's good," Bill's face lifted in a smile at the mention of her name, eyes lighting up. "I didn't realize you two knew each other. I haven't seen her in a few months - Gringotts business, ya know, - but she writes all the time. Keeps me in the loop."Dahlia laughed, saying suggestively, "Oh, we certainly know each other very well."Bill looked curiously at Dahlia, suddenly suspicious at Dahlia's tone. "Oh?"Dahlia winked at him, "All in good time, my friend, all in good time. Perhaps ask her about our midnight excursions in the greenhouses."Before Bill could say anything else, the door to Mr. Weasley's hospital room opened, and the younger Weasley's came flooding out."He's asleep," Ron explained as they shuffled single file out of the door. "Mum said for us to head home and she'll meet us there for dinner."The Weasley clan, plus Dahlia and Harry, made their way to the Floo point where they all immediately left for Grimmauld place. The rest of Christmas Break passed by at a fast pace. Dahlia received an owl a week before their set return to Hogwarts from Dumbledore to inform her that her Occlumency lessons would start the first night of her return. Apparently it had become urgent that her and Harry both learn to occlude while asleep, so as not to have any subconscious excursions again.The most annoying thing that happened over break was the twins turning 17; and they started apparating everywhere. To the kitchen, to the girls room, to the bathroom. Dahlia had enough one day when she was stepping out of the shower, and there was a loud crack and suddenly a red-headed boy was standing in the middle of her bathroom, oggling at her."Merlin's fucking beard!" Dahlia screamed, almost falling in an attempt to wrap a towel around herself. "God damn it, George!" Her angry yells only made George smile bigger."Why, hello there, gorgeous." He wiggled his eyebrows ridiculously as he spoke, smirking at her jokingly."Get. Out!" Dahlia screamed, pointing angrily towards the door as she clutched the towel around her chest. "Can't a girl have some privacy!?"Another loud crack and Fred appeared, right next to George."The bloody hell is all this arguing?" It took him half a second to register that Dahlia was in a tower, soaking wet and glowering at both of them. His jaw dropped, head whipping around to glare at his chuckling twin as dahlia screamed.Dahlia stomped her foot, clutching the towel to her chest as she glared daggers at the twins. "Get out before I curse you!"The twin's stood there for one more second, one upset and the other cackling before disappearing at the last moment when Dahlia dove for her wand. Dahlia got ready, grumbling as she tossed her stuff into her trunk. She reverently packed the texts Malfoy had given her, along with a few carefully selected titles from the Black Library. She'd transfigured an old necklace into a gold chain; they key to the Black Library now rests around her neck, locked up tight.Sirius had been right; there were many dark books in the library, some guarded by horrible spells. She'd felt the overwhelming heaviness of dark magic the moment she'd stepped into the library. Since they were heading back to Hogwarts today she'd felt it prudent to relock the doors to ensure no undeserving person stumbled across a fowl curse in the room. She had larger problems than to worry about locking Sirius out of a room he'd given her full access to. Her first lesson with Dumbledore was tomorrow - and she was nervous. Part of her was suspicious, a lingering doubt warning her that Dumbledore only wanted to teach her so he could get into her head. Otherwise, why not send her to have lessons with Snape like he had with Harry.Dahlia had been meaning to speak to Harry, about many different things. Their unspecific bond, parseltongue, and occlumency to start with, but they never seemed to be alone in Grimmauld place. If it wasn't one of the twins apparating in, it was Ron, Hermione, and Ginny arriving with a new list of chores from Mrs. Weasley, who seemed determined to keep their minds off of the Order Meetings they were prohibited from attending. Mr. Weasley's recovery demanded much of everyone's attention, despite their being banned from returning to the Hospital. Now, the break was over, and everyone was throwing last minute items into their trunks and double checking under their beds for remaining, forgotten items."We've got to leave for King's Crossing in five minutes!" Mrs. Weasley's screeching could be heard three floors down. Hermione, Ginny, and Dahlia collectively sighed, snapping their trunks closed, and dragging them out into the hallway where they were met by the four disgruntled looking boys."Everyone ready to head back to hell?" Ginny asked with force cheerfulness."What're the odds someone murdered Umbridge over the holiday?" Ron sounded pessimistically hopeful, hair still mussed from sleep."Nah, mangy bitch is too evil to die -" Fred interjected sourly."Prolly spent her holiday eating the skulls of children," George added spitefully, sharing his twin's look of contempt for the foul woman."Everybody ready to go?" Mrs. Weasley appeared on the steps, looking suspiciously between her children as though she'd overheard their conversation."Yes, Mum," Ginny rolled her eyes, lugging her trunk after her mother, complaining about their return to hell, as she called it. The rest followed suit until they were piled into Mr. Weasley's magically enlarged car and on their way to King's Crossing. Mr. Weasley was ecstatic; this was his first outing since his injury. Sirius had thrown a fit to be permitted to go and see Harry off, but even Dumbledore had intervened, warning him that now wasn't the time for him to be spotted.Instead of Sirius, Dahlia now had a mangy black dog that looked eerily similar to the Grim hiding behind her legs in the car. Hermione had hissed at it, saying something along the lines of "impossible to break out of Azkaban twice!" before taking her jacket and tossing it over him. Dahlia had left it at that. Hermione had given her blessing to hide the dog - so she simply shifting her legs to ensure the dog remained out of Molly's view.Unfortunately, no one had time to come up with a plan to hide him during the unloading of the car, causing Molly to almost screech his name when her eyes landed on his mangy dog form."Seri- PADF- fuck." Molly slammed her door, storming away and into Kings Crossing, leaving the rest of her family to trot after her. Ron exchanged looks with the twins, who were whispering wide-eyed that they'd never heard such language fall from their "angelic mother's lips".Molly remained upset right up until it was time for everyone to board the train. Then she broke down in tears, anger abandoned, clinging to each of her children individually before reaching Harry and Dahlia. Mrs. Weasley pulled Harry into a hug, patting his back and reminding him to be a good boy at school. When she reached Dahlia, Dahlia wasn't sure if she would also receive such a warm hug.She was pleasantly surprised when Molly burst into tears and pulled her into a tighter hug than anyone else. "You're welcome anytime," Molly whispered into Dahlia's ear as she clung to the girl. "You're a Weasley now. Come stay for the summer, we'll make room."Dahlia's eyes teared up at the woman's words, and she found herself clinging back to the woman. "Thank you," Dahlia whispered as they broke away, and Molly shooed the group towards the train."Hurry along now, you can't miss the train!""Wouldn't want to take us in the flying car, mum?" George tossed their mother a wink.Molly visibly flustered at the comment, her eyes darting around as though worried others would hear it. "Fred!""I'm George, mum -""Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?"Dahlia stifled a laugh as the twins' comments only made Mrs. Weasley even more flustered."Oh - George,""Only joking, mum, I am Fred." the mischievous twin winked at his mother before dodging her smack to the head and scampering off to the train."Make sure you write, all of you!" Mrs. Weasley called after them as they all followed Fred's suit. The seven of them waved to Mrs. Weasley from their compartment window as the train slowly pulled out of the station. The train hadn't even reached top speed before the twins were rising out of their seats simultaneously, stretching."Ah, well, good holiday, but we've some business to discuss before our arrival to hell," Fred spoke as he and George made their way out of the compartment."We'll see you at dinner!" George added cheerfully before clicking the door shut behind them."Business to discuss?" Ron looked curiously at Harry and Hermione, glancing back at the door the twins had just exited. "Anyone have any idea what they're talking about? They're already making loads!""Have you ever wondered where they got their start up?" Hermione added, glancing up from the book she'd been reading, nodding with Ron's suspicions. "I mean, they're inventing brilliant products, but it's got to cost loads of money."Dahlia noticed Harry avert his gaze, saw him casting a cautious one up at her. She met his eye for a moment when realization dawned, grin widening. She had a suspicious feeling she knew where their Triwizard tournament winnings had gone."Oi! Malfoy!" Blaise called through the compartment door. Footsteps stopped outside the door for a second before the door sild open to reveal the blonde Slytherin. He looked exhausted, circles under his eyes, skin paler than normal.. "Saved you a seat."Malfoy just gave a nod, dropping into the seat next to Blaise without a word. Nott lifted a hand in silent greeting, Malfoy nodding back. Theo was seated across from them; otherwise the compartment was empty.Malfoy cast a silent Muffliato before leaning forward, voice low and whispered, "Did you talk to your fathers over break?"Blaise's face darkened, his eyes suddenly deadly. "Yeah," he spat dejectedly, voice sour. "If you can call that talking.""So, you know?" Malfoy leaned back, relief flooding him. He wasn't the only one going through this - he wasn't the only one who's parents had thrown them away."Unfortunately," Theo snarled, his arms folded across his chest. The dark look on his face was vengeful. "I'm assuming Bulstrode, Avery, and Flint are included?""Crabbe and Goyle as well," Blaise rolled his eyes. "Not like they'll be good for much, so they're probably safe, as well as the younger kids.""Parkinson, both Greengrasses, Travers, and Selwyn, too," Malfoy added numbly, rubbing his temples. "But they aren't favored.""No, that'd be us," Blaise spat, shuffling in his seat. "All because of what? Our fathers?""We'll be favored more than you," Theo gestured to himself and Malfoy, referring to Blaise's blood status."Thank Merlin for that," Blaise lifted his hand as though cheering them. "Here's to parental fuck ups and children sacrifices!"The group settled into an uneasy silence, each's thoughts drifting off to their own separate hell. Holiday break had been horribly enlightening in the Malfoy household. The day before Christmas Lucius Malfoy had pulled Draco into his private study. Apparently, Lucius's mission wasn't going well. The Dark Lord had ordered Nott and Zabini Srs. to assist Malfoy in his task - which was still being kept secret from Draco. Should their fathers fail, the Dark Lord would choose one between their sons to serve in Mr. Malfoy's place.The news had not come easy to Draco, who'd baulked at it instantly. He'd refused, saying he'd rather die than be forced to serve that psychopath. He offered to help his father with his mission, anything to prevent him from taking the Mark Lucius had silenced him, literally, insisting that if called, Draco would do what was necessary.Draco had left his father's study immediately afterward, his world spinning. If his father failed, he would become a Death Eater. The thought rang in his head so loud it dampened any other thought. He didn't even feel the pain as slammed his fist into the first thing he saw in his room - an antique armoir. He'd shattered the door on, fist punching straight through.He'd pulled his hand out, ignoring the blood that started to steep from the cuts he'd inflicted. He slammed his hand into the other door with a loud scream, sobs escaping his throat. He'd broken down, coming to a torturous realization. His father had all but sold him to Voldemort, and he had no choice in the matter.

The next day, Dahlia climbed the steps to the headmaster's office, steeling herself to be calm and reserved for her class with her guardian. She'd made it through her normal classes easily, and now it was time for her Occlumency lesson with Dumbledore. As she ascended the stairs she reminded herself why she was doing this; she was doing this for Harry. If she could have it her way she wouldn't be speaking to Albus - the more she festered the more angry she got at him. He'd kept too many secrets for too long, lied by omission, and avoided her questions too much. She wasn't particularly happy about the thought that he was most likely going to be poking around in her head tonight, but it couldn't be avoided. She only hoped a select few memories would be safe in her mind. Hopefully the headmaster wouldn't go looking too deep, and hopefully she'd understood the magic correctly.With a deep breath, feeling as though she had just walked to her death, she knocked on the door to the study. "Come in!" his voice was muffled through the door. Dahlia turned the handle and pushed the door open, surprised to find her guardian perched on a recliner chair, not behind his desk."Dahlia," Albus smiled at her, gesturing her over. "Come, sit," he pointed at a second recliner chair across from him. Dahlia strode forward and sat in her selected chair, crossing her legs and leaning back. She closed her eyes, allowing her body to relax into the chair for a moment."You should implement these chairs in every class."Dumbledore laughed, his eyes twinkling. "Yes, well, unfortunately, I can think of many students right off the top of my hat that would take advantage of these comfortable chairs and sleep through class.""I suppose that could be an issue," Dahlia admitted with a small smile. She straightened, giving her guardian a no nonsense look, silently asking him to begin."Before we begin our Occlumency lessons tonight, I wanted to talk to you about your dream you shared with Harry." Dumbledore's gaze locked on hers. Dahlia swallowed, eyes rolling in contempt. "Do you have any idea why you and Harry would have had the same dream?""I think we can all agree it wasn't a dream, Albus," Dahlia said, her voice hardening. Her vision was weeks ago, and now he wants to talk about it? "I came back in blood, and Arthur came back half dead. That wasn't a dream."Dumbledore raised his hand in defeat. "You're right; I apologize. Allow me to rephrase... Why do you think you and Harry would have the same vision?"Dahlia hesitated, looking away from the headmaster's knowing stare. She inhaled deeply, trying to control her temper. As much as she disliked it, if anyone was going to understand why it had happened, it would be her guardian. "I have a theory.""You always were a clever witch. I also have a theory. Why don't you tell me what you think it is and then I shall tell you, and we can compare notes?"Dahlia mulled it over for a moment before nodding. That was more fair of a deal than most the ones he made, especially since she'd get to know his thoughts for once. "Alright then." She leaned forward in the chair, propping her arms on her knees. "I think the vow I made Harry during the Triwizard tournament wasn't specific, and therefore wasn't deactivated. I read a book a few months ago that spoke about magical vows based on more than just the words; they focused on the intent behind them.""Ah, yes, Magical Vows and Bonds, by Digileous Newton, I believe?" Dumbledore nodded knowingly. "What were the words of your vow?""I, Dahlia Ariana Dumbledore, swear myself to you, Harry James Potter, as your second. On my magic, I will defend and support you in your endeavors; we accept this burden together; should you fail, I will succeed." Dahlia looked almost shocked, shaking her head slightly. "That was... I didn't even think about it...""If you had read a few chapters further into Magical Vows and Bonds you would have discovered that once a magical vow or bond is made it is inscribed on your magic; on the very core of your being. The words of the vow have become a part of you." Dumbledore cocked his head at his ward. "What was the intent behind your words, Dahlia?""I was... I was trying to find a way to bind it so that Harry knew I was swore to protect the people he loved. That's what he is always trying to do; it's in everything he does. That's why he chose me as a second. Th-that was my intent. If Harry couldn't protect them, then I would.""'If you should fail, I will succeed." Dumbledore's eyebrows went high, concern wafting over his features. "Yes, well, any bonds made during the Triwizard tournament should have become null the moment the final bell rang on the third event. However," Dumbledore looked over his spectacles at her, "Seeing as how your intent behind your vow was different than the other seconds, as well as your recalling it so automatically, it would seem as though the vow is still in effect.""Alright," Dahlia felt encouraged at his confirmation - she had been right about at least one thing. "So, it's still there. Harry has a connection to Voldemort, right?""Of sorts, yes," Dumbledore seemed wary of her question, immediately becoming withdrawn. Dahlia wanted to push for more, but forced herself to stay on task."So, what if Voldemort was there that night?" Dahlia rushed on, leaning forward eagerly. "What if he was there? Or if he was the snake? Harry was asleep, so he wasn't occluding. What if subconsciously, without either of them knowing, Harry connected with Voldemort, and saw what he was doing?" Dahlia paused, waiting to see if her guardian could confirm or deny her theory so far.Dumbledore's fingers tapped on the arm of his recliner. He seemed to be deep in thought before leaning forward, voice soft. "I'm not sure what I can disclose here, but I'm very interested to hear the rest of your theory."Dahlia rolled her eyes, disgruntled at her guardian's evading. "That's it. That's my theory. Voldemort and Harry's connection causes Harry to connect with him. Voldemort attacks Mr. Weasley, and Harry feels as though he's failed. Harry's always trying to protect everyone, and he was stuck watching Mr. Weasley get attacked; watching as though Harry was the one attacking. That would have activated my vow. I'm asleep, also not occluding, and the vow activates. I don't know the details; I need to get my hands on more books about it, but it would make sense, right?"For a moment Albus processed her words before pushing himself up from his recliner. Dumbledore paced around his study, stopping in front of one of his large bookshelves full of mismatched books, and curious odds and ends. "Have you heard of blood magic?"Dahlia was surprised at the question, taking a moment to think. Albus perused his bookshelf, fingers trailing down the spines of books as his lips moved silently with their titles. "I've heard of it, " she said hesitantly, watching her guardian closely, "but isn't it mostly viewed as Dark Magic?"Dumbledore turned to give her a curious look, fingers stopping on the back of a particularly large novel. "Surely by now you've realized magic isn't all dark and light. There's plenty of greys, too. Blood Magic can be Dark Magic, yes, but it can also be Light Magic.""I don't understand.""The Peverell family is one of the most distinguished families in wizarding history. Because their bloodline is so ancient, it is difficult to trace the early branches on the tree. Most of it predates recorded history. However, this I can prove." Dumbledore pulled the large, dusty volume from one of the top shelves of the bookcase and dropped the text onto his desk. He gestured for Dahlia to come look as he began to flip through the pages. She stood, approaching the desk hesitantly, glancing warily up at Dumbledore as he began to speak, pages settling."The three brothers, Ignotus, Cadmus, Atrioch." Dumbledore pointed to their names in the book as he said them. "Ignotus married a woman - it never mentions her name - and they had four children. Two boys -Ischamar and Belior, and two girls. There is extensive records on the boys, through their line I was able to trace that Amalar Peverell, grandson of Ignotus Peverell married a Lady Guinevere Gryffindor, daughter of Godric Gryffindor in 960, and together they had six children - four boys and two girls. Records are extensive on the males, as always, however, this is all I was able to find on the girls." His fingers stopped on a small paragraph, handwritten in tiny scratch that looked like a woman's hand.Andrelica Peverell - born 967 to Ischamar Peverell and Lady Guinevere Peverell an hour after dusk.Basilea Peverell - born 965 to Ischamar Peverell and Lady Guinevere Peverell in the early hours of morning.Dahlia held her breath, running her hand over the writing - this was what she'd been searching for. And it had been here this whole time? "Basilea..." she looked up at the Dumbledore for confirmation. "This is...""Your mother," Dumbledore nodded seriously. He moved to flip over to another page, stopping again to shower her another text. "I was never able to find any information on your mother's childhood or early adult years, until I hit the marriage record section. Beside Amalar and Guinevere's son's marriage lines is another small note," Dumbledore pointed it out to her, and Dahlia bent over to read the same, tiny minuscule writing that the previous entry had.Andrelica Peverell was wed to Atlantes Gaunt in the year 984.Basilea Peverell was wed to Fernsby Prewett in the year 983.Scrawled directly underneath that entry, blurred by water was another entry, so minuscule it was almost impossible to read.Basilea Peverell widowed in 996, having borne two sons to Fernsby Prewett.Basilea Peverell - with child, declared missing in 1000. Presumed dead.Dahlia's hand had flown over her mouth, tears pooling in her eyes as she looked up at her guardian. A tear trickled down her cheeks, emotion overwhelming her. She forgot her anger for the moment, rereading the feminine handwriting. "She was pregnant with me?""I believe so," Dumbledore nodded, smiling softly at her, his own blue eyes welling up "Only I think between when she went missing, and when Severus found her she gave birth, presumably quite soon after. Now that we have proven your ancestry, allow me to explain where I was going with this." Dumbledore flipped back through the book to the family tree. He started pointing out surnames that began to surface. "There are 28 families deemed worthy of the status "pureblood" that have little to no trace of non magical blood. We refer to them as the -""Sacred 28, I know," Dahlia interrupted, nodding for Albus to continue, her mind spinning at what he had just said. His words replayed on a loop; he'd said it so casually, as though it was no big deal. "Wait, hold on."Albus paused, glancing up at her expectantly. "Yes?""You're saying my mom had me before she managed to go through time?"Albus nodded slowly, "Yes, well, your mother was no longer pregnant when Professor Snape found her, so that would be the educated assumption.""So, I'm like, a thousand years old?"Albus cracked a smile, his eyes twinkling. "I guess that would be technically correct, my dear." He shuffled through a few pages in his book as Dahlia stood flabbergasted, barely hearing him as he continued to speak. "Many of the Sacred 28 can be traced back to having ties with the Peverell family. Some families, while deemed the title pureblood, have ties to non magical blood and therefore do not make the Sacred 28 list, despite their strong magical ties." Dumbledore's fingers stopped over a name in the book. "Potter, for example. Charlus Potter, James Potter's father was a pureblood, and can be traced to being directly descended from Ignotus Peverell." Dumbledore glanced up at Dahlia to see her eyes flying wide."So, Harry and I are -?""Related, distantly, yes," Dumbledore smiled gently. "Almost everyone of magical descent has ancestral ties with each other. The Olivanders, Potters, and Abbots are the first names to appear in the Peverell lines. We see Fawleys, Selwyn's, and Prewetts marrying in, all from prestigious blood lines themselves." Dahlia's face wrinkled at the thought of everyone being interrelated, causing Dumbledore to chuckle."Genetically, Dahlia, you and Harry are not related. Too many different factors and ancestry have ensured that. However, what intrigues me, is how similar your magical signatures are. I believe that your magic ties both of you strongly enough to the Peverell bloodline that it aided in the strengthening of your vow."Dahlia was quiet for a moment as she processed her guardian's words. Her and Harry share a small part of their magical signature, making their vow stronger than anticipated, causing her to see his vision? "So you're saying you think my theory is right. And your theory adds to mine?""I believe we both had a valuable piece of the puzzle," Dumbledore said demurely as he closed the book they'd been searching. "I promise we can discuss more of this later. Now, onto the task at hand. I've been told you've been reading and attempting the basics of occlumency?"Dahlia nodded, slightly thrown off by the quick change of subject. In light of all the new information she'd forgotten the real reason she'd been summoned to his office that evening. "Y-yes, but I don't think I've quite got it."Dumbledore chuckled, eyes twinkling. "Well, let's begin and see what you've managed so far."Dahlia closed her eyes, trying to think of memories she could call to her mind that her guardian could see. Classes, meals, evenings in the common room, she pictured all those things, praying that those memories would be enough to keep her unwanted ones hidden in the shadows. She was so busy picturing memories that she was completely caught off guard when she felt a painful probing against her thoughts, everything going black.Dahlia was stumbling from the headmaster's office an hour and a half later. It was past curfew, though it was not late. Umbridge had seen it fit to invoke a new mandated curfew: all students were to be in their common rooms no later than 8:00. Unfortunately for Dahlia, it was now 8:15, and her head was pounding. The corridors were empty - students feared a detention from Delores Umbridge.Albus had explained the basics to her - Occlumency was basically compartmentalizing your thoughts magically. He had shown her how to best organize her thoughts, and how to try to tuck a memory away so it remained untouched. He'd shown her everything, but not before hitting her with an unexpected Leglimens. It'd been painful, searing pain that had brought her to her knees before she felt the gentle probing in her mind, trying to pull memories from her mind. The first memory that Albus pulled was nothing, just Dahlia angrily ripping a parchment and tossing it in the fire - saying something along the lines of "-bloody fucking git, assigning all these bloody fucking papers on bullshit! - before huffing and starting again. The next memory he had pulled had Dahlia falling backwards against the floor.Cedric's face floated in front of her, but not the real life version - not the memory in the graveyard, nor the memory of the tournament, none of the good memories of the two of them in the library together. It was one of her dreams - her nightmare. His face was marred and twisted in pain, and he floated lifeless before her, suspended in the darkness. As she turned away from him another body formed in front of her - the face of a boy she'd only ever see again in her nightmares. The jet black hair, pale skin, his eyes closed in death... Dahlia almost vomited as his face swam before her eyes. His face was twisted in pain and shock, suspended in the moment that Dahlia kept reliving over and over again. His death. At her hands.NO. Dahlia thought, desperately clawing at the invincible force in her mind. She pushed, willing her magic to aid her. Not this one!Whether it was desperation or panic, Dahlia felt her magic push the force from her mind, and she was able to open her eyes. She was sprawled on the ground, panting. Dumbledore remained sitting in his chair, looking at her with an unreadable expression."Al... you can't..." Dahlia's head was pounding, and she couldn't get her words to form sentences correctly. She rubbed her temples as she tried to take calming breaths, willing her heart rate to return to normal. This was what she had feared - Albus invading her most private thoughts."Who was the boy, Dahlia?" Dumbledore's voice was stern."Is this why you decided to teach me Occlumency?" Dahlia spat, pushing herself up so she was sitting. Fury flashed in her eyes as she glared at her guardian. "You wanted free range to be able to poke around inside my mind?" She pushed herself to her feet, swaying slightly.Dumbledore remained silent, never taking his gaze off of hers. "I never meant to invade your privacy, Dahlia. I needed to see what you knew so we know where to start. I tried to select memories that didn't feel private." His mouth quirked up in a half smile. "The one of you doing homework was most... entertaining."Dahlia's face flushed as she looked away. "Yeah, well, Snape's a git."Dumbledore chuckled, but his voice was serious when he spoke. "My wish is not to invade your privacy during our sessions, Dahlia. I only ask about the boy because...""I don't talk about him," Dahlia snarled, defensively, pushing herself to her feet. "What happened... happened."Dumbledore said nothing then, and nothing was spoken of the boy for the remainder of their lesson. It was then that he had pulled several more ancient looking books down from his bookcase, and had proceeded to explain to her how to lock up and compartmentalize her thoughts. He'd given her homework: shift through her thoughts and memories, and start sorting them into their own private compartment. The more private, the more locks. After practicing the basics, he'd spent the next forty-five minutes diving into her thoughts while she attempted to deflect the invasion. The last ten minutes Dahlia had successfully prevented him from entering twice, and was swiftly able to dispel him from her mind when he did get past her. The magic needed for such feats was so draining Dahlia felt as though she hadn't eaten in days - her limbs physically heavy.Dahlia's feet stumbled over themselves, jerking her back to reality. She was halfway to Gryffindor tower - just had to make it up the Grand Staircase. She huffed a sigh before dragging herself further down the hallway, hand gripping the stair rails as she began to huff up the stairs. Her head was pounding; it felt as though someone had hit her on the head with a hammer.She was so focused on making it to the common room so she could collapse with a bottle of fire-whiskey that she didn't hear the voices approaching her from down the corridor. By the time she processed it, they had already spotted her - she hadn't even made it up one of the staircases."Look who we have here!" It was an Inquisitorial Squad member. Dahlia winced, squinting against her growing migraine to make out who was approaching her. Her headache afflicted her vision, eyes shooting pain as she squinted harder, trying to make out the two figures approaching her."Dumbledore's ward," a voice she recognized spoke with a laugh."Zabini, Nott," Dahlia looked at them apprehensively as they stopped in front of her. Notorious Slytherins, and Draco's lackeys when Goyle and Crabbe weren't around. They couldn't mean anything except bad news. Dahlia stiffened, trying to appear normal, despite the hammering in her head and the heaviness of her body."What are you doing out past curfew?" It was Zabini who spoke, although his voice lacked the normal aggression Slytherin's carried for Gryffindors. He seemed more curious than anything, closely observing her weakened state."Had a meeting with the headmaster," Dahlia smirked at them, trying to ignore the sledgehammer feeling in her temples, "so before you go giving me detention or knocking points off, I've just left his office and I was headed straight to Gryffindor tower.""Hmmm, of course, can't forbid you from going to see your Pop now can we?" Nott seemed to also lack his usual amount of aggression. Dahlia's right hand fidgeted over her wand in her pocket, suspicion setting in. What were they up to?"He's not my father," Dahlia retorted shortly, starting to move past them. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment with a bottle of firewhiskey in my dorm."One of them snagged her arm, whirling her back around. Normally, Dahlia would have lashed out and struck him, but her head was pounding too much, and Occlumency had drained her of any energy. Instead she allowed Zabini to turn her around, rolling her eyes as she raised a finger threateningly at them. "What do you want?""Turns out we also have an appointment with Firewhiskey. Come back and drink with us in Slytherin."Dahlia's jaw dropped and she cocked her head at him. She pulled her wand out of her pocket and held it threateningly, alternating pointing it between them. "What are y'all playing at?" She asked, looking incredulous. Since when do Slytherins openly invite a Gryffindor back to their common room?"What? Scared your Gryffindor drinking habits can't keep up with Slytherin's?" Nott's voice issued a challenge.A fire sparked in Dahlia. Damn it, she hated backing down from a challenge. Outwardly, she rolled her eyes, sighed loudly as she contemplated what to do. She'd been planning on drinking alone in the shower, before climbing into bed and drinking the remainder. She'd gotten quite used to drinking alone, so she was surprised when she found herself saying, "Fine, but I'm bringing my own drink."Nott's eyes flew open wide with surprise. "Wait, really?"Dahlia rolled her eyes, gesturing for them to lead the way. Mentally she was already cursing herself for agreeing to such a ridiculous thing. "I got a bloody headache, and a million reasons to drink. As long as you don't talk my bloody ear off or try to drug my drink, I'll drink with you."Zabini's hand flew over his chest in a silent gasp. "We'll be perfect gentlemen. Our mama's raised us right," he added with a wink as he strode forward. Dahlia rolled her eyes as she trudged after him, keeping Nott in her peripheral as he walked beside her."For the record, I have another appointment with the headmaster tomorrow evening, and if I don't show up for it he's going to wonder where I am," Dahlia feels the need to inform them as she follows the Slytherin down a back hallway, silently cursing herself for agreeing to this. What the bloody fucking hell had she been thinking? How was she going to explain her extended disappearance to Harry, Ron, and Hermione?Nott rolled his eyes, turning to shoot her an exasperated look. "Do you Gryffindors really think so low of Slytherins? Honestly? Or do you think us dumb enough to blatantly kidnap Albus Dumbledore's ward?" he shook his head at her, and Dahlia winced."Sorry," she muttered as they took a spiral staircase down several flights. Mentally she chided herself for treating them such a way - the words of the sorting hat reminded her that she easily could have been one of them. She followed them in silence, their feet hitting the stone steps were the only sounds as they trotted downward for several minutes."If we're drinking, we're betting," Dahlia broke the silence, noting the flash of shock that crossed Nott's face. "If I outdrink you, you owe me 20 Galleons."The boys' faces morphed into devilish smirks, exchanging mischievous looks. "Confident in your Gryffindor drinking habits, Dumbledore?"Dahlia snorted. "Hardly. Confident in my drinking habits."Nott cracked a smile, shoving out his hand as they came to a stop in front of a bare wall in the lowest floor of the dungeons. "You got yourself a deal, Dumbledore.""Count me in," Zabini shook on it as well, gesturing to the blank wall. "Welcome to Slytherin."Dahlia looked at him blankly, eyebrows raised in silent questioning. She wasn't going to indulge him with questions. He seemed to sense this, because he rolled his eyes and stepped through the wall, disappearing behind it without any further explanation.Dahlia glanced sideways at Nott in shock, finding him watching her with an amused grin. The wall must be the entrance to their common room. "There's no password?""It's magically charmed to only allow Slytherins to get in," Nott explained as he grabbed hold of her wrist gently. Dahlia jerked away from him, shooting him an alarmed look."Did I mention touching me is also off the table?"Nott rolled his eyes, sticking his hand out for her hand, "The wall is charmed, you idiot. You can't get in unless a Slytherin brings you in.""Oh," Dahlia offered him her arm again, giving him a sheepish smile. "Sorry."Nott grabbed her arm, pulling her through the wall, muttering under his breath. Dahlia felt a cool wave of magic wash over her, everything around her glistening and grey before the next second she was stepping into the Slytherin common room.Dahlia's breath hitched; it was beautiful. It was take-your-breath-away stunning. She'd always pictured it as this hole in the dungeons - dark, dreary, mopey, and wet. All things that it was decidedly not. The first thing her eyes landed on was the glass wall. She hadn't realized that part of the castle was underwater until she was looking through a glass wall and into the black lake. Murkish blobs floated by of various sizes, the sun's rays casting blue-ish green lights on the marble floors. The glass wall extended upwards, Dahlia's eyes following it until she could see the entire ceiling was glass windows, submerged under the lake. Her eyes trailed away to the stone walls, where moss and vines grew up in them. It was amazing. The stone walls were submerged in the vines growing up, small flowers budding on them. The walls were decorated simply, torch brackets and various portraits hung up. There was a huge marble fireplace that was roaring to life, casting a warm, inviting glow. The portrait of Merlin hung above it, his face looking more warm than usually portrayed. Couches, loveseats, and recliners were all scattered throughout the spacious room, all noble Slytherin green. Warm, plush blankets of various greens, greys, and blacks were tossed over the backs of arm chairs; plush pillows decorated every couch and seat. Study tables with comfortable seats were tucked into corners, suits of armor scattered about. A large bookcase dedicated to Firewhiskey bottles stood next to the fireplace, all stocked and full to the brim. The room was so...regal it took Dahlia's breath away as she spun in a slow circle, drinking it all in."Beautiful, huh?" Zabini's voice drew her from her reverie, studying her reaction to the room closely"Yes," Dahlia breathed, turning slowly back to the boys. "It's beautiful.""Not what you pictured, eh?" Nott smirked at her knowingly. Dahlia flushed, averting her eyes."No, not at all," she responds curtly, brandishing her wand in the air. A bottle of muggle tequila is conjured in front of her on the nearest study table, and she reaches for it eagerly.Nott and Zabini look at it in disgust. "The fuck is that?" Nott's face scrunched up as he eyed the clear liquid apprehensively."It's muggle liquor," Dahlia explained with an eye roll, the pain in her temples slowly fading to a thud. "It's not bad, actually. Quite strong.""Why not just drink Firewhiskey?" Zabini reached over and snatched the bottle from her hands, lifting it up to eye level so he could examine it closely.Dahlia shrugged, snatching the bottle away from him immediately. "This one burns more," she said simply as she unscrewed the cap and knocked back a chug. She licked her lips as she lowered the bottle from her lips, noting the boy's judgmental faces."Nothing burns more than Firewhiskey," Nott contradicted her, summoning his own bottle from their book-case supply, taking a gulp from it as if to contradict her.Dahlia shrugged, cradling her bottle against her chest protectively. "Think what you want, but you haven't tried this. And I've tried both, so that makes me the expert."The bottle was snatched from her hands before she could stop it. Dahlia pouted, glaring at Nott as he plucked the bottle from her grip and unscrewed it, sniffing the contents."If I try your drink you have to try mine," he stopped the bottle of firewhiskey he'd opened and tossed it to her. She caught it, rolling it around to read the bottle.Dahlia scowled at the bottle, pushing it to the side, "No, thanks."Zabini rolled his eyes from his arm chair near the fire. "For Merlin's sake, Dumbledore, we already said we wouldn't drug you, and he sipped it first.""I don't think you drugged it," Dahlia defied him as she grudgingly took the bottle and lifted it to her lips. The cinnamon burned her throat on the way down, but not as satisfying as the tequila was. She shrugged, tossing the bottle over to Zabini. "You're behind, Zabini."Nott took a large swig of her tequila, spluttering as he struggled to swallow. Dahlia stifled a laugh as she swiped the bottle back from the boy, his face twisted in a gag. "The fuck is that stuff?" he shivered as he wiped his chin."Told you it was strong," Dahlia shrugged, taking another sip from her bottle."How do you drink that?" Nott was staring at her, both incredulous and disgusted."I like the way it burns," Dahlia said with a shrug, spinning the bottle mindlessly in her hands."You're fucked up."That drew a laugh from her, surprising both her and the Slytherins. She clapped a hand over her mouth as though to muffle the sound, but it escaped anyways. "Sorry... I don't know why that was funny."Zabini looked at her queerly, a smile pulling at his lips. "Who'd have thought the Headmaster's ward was an alcoholic.""If you had to grow up with Albus you'd be one too." The words were out before she could stop them, a hand clapping over her mouth again as she glanced between them wide eyed.Zabini and Nott exchanged amused glances as Dahlia tried to backpedal. "Sorry... forget I said that.""Relax, Dumbledore, you aren't the only one with shitty parents." Zabini waved his hand towards Nott and then at himself. "If anyone gets fucked up parents it'd be this lot."His words put her to ease slightly, but her mouth continued to move of its own accord. "'Reckon I'm the only one with no parents, though.""Merlin's left nut," Nott took another swig of his firewhiskey. "Isn't there a lighter topic? We don't want her demolishing into a blubbering mess on the floor."Dahlia quirked a brow at him as she mimicked him, lifting her alcohol to her lips and taking another swig. "You take me for the kind of girl that 'demolishes into a blubbering mess' do you?"Nott shrugged, his words showing his own lack of filter, "Guess we all saw the breakdown after the tournament, didn't we?"Dahlia froze. Zabini froze. It was like the Slytherin common room came to a complete standstill, although it was only the three of them in the room. Dahlia turned slightly, her gaze zeroed in on Nott.Zabini had the decency to look scared, but Nott just tilted his head, looking at her with his brows raised. To her surprise, Dahlia felt her lips turn up in a twisted smile, raising her bottle to Nott in a salute. "I guess we did, didn't we?" She chugged the bottle for several seconds, looking at the boys who seemed to be frozen across from her."I bet you'd break down too if you did what I did - saw what I saw." Dahlia knew the alcohol was loosening her tongue slightly, but she didn't care. She leaned forward, gesturing for the Slytherin's to drink."Yeah, I bet we would," Zabini said quietly, averting his gaze as her eyes shot to his."You believe me then?" She asked in surprise, closely studying Zabini, "You believe Harry?""There are two sides to every war, Dumbledore," Nott's voice sounded bored as he interjected into their conversation, giving Zabini a warning look. "Just because we believe you doesn't mean we're on your side."A metal taste filled Dahlia's mouth at his words, her gut wrenching at the realization of what he was saying, but she forced herself to outwardly remain impassive. "I'm not allowed to have a side." She said nonchalantly, twisting her bottle in her hands distractedlyZabini glanced at her curiously, rolling his eyes as he summoned his own bottle. "And what the bloody hell does that mean?"Dahlia shut her mouth, choosing instead to drink deeply from her bottle. There was silence in the room before Dahlia huffed, lifting her hand and waving it at the table to her right. "I don't know about you, but I need a smoke."At her wave, a packet of papers and a baggie of muggle weed were conjured on the table. Dahlia pushed herself forward, sliding so she could begin to roll. When she glanced up the Slytherin's were staring at her in silent shock."What?" Dahlia glanced between them, lowering the half rolled joint from her lips. "Have you never smoked before?"The Slytherin's remained in shock, unmoving, blank stares piercing her. Finally Nott managed to give her an insulted look, jaw snapping closed. "We're Slytherins, Dumbledore, of course we've bloody smoked before.""Then what's with the face?" Dahlia resumed rolling, keeping her eyes trained on the boys as she awaited their answer."You conjured that," Zabini gestured to the supplies in front of her on the table, "like it was nothing."Dahlia finished rolling, setting the joint down on the table in front of her. "I don't understand your point.""Wandless," Nott croaked breathlessly. "You conjured it wandless."Dahlia instantly flushed, realizing her mistake. She grappled for words for a few long seconds before shrugging, "Yeah... and? You've seen me do wandless magic before.""In self defense," Zabini argued, leaning forward, suddenly very curious. "Umbridge attacked you.""You can control your magic wandless?" Nott whispered, looking reverently at Dahlia with wide green eyes.Dahlia's face turned a deeper pink, mind spinning. She scrambled to try to think of any way to deny it, but knew whatever lie she concocted they would never buy. "I can do little things," Dahlia admitted, making a point to light the joint with her wand. Blood rushed to her head; white noise rang in her ears. She forced herself to breathe normally, attempting to appear relaxed, trying to hide her panic.Zabini and Nott exchanged glances, but surprisingly didn't push her on the matter. She released a shaky breath as they accepted the lit joint she passed them. They smoked the joint in welcome silence, until apparently Nott decided sitting in silence wasn't suiting him anymore."So, Dumbledore, have you ever played Quidditch before?"Dahlia turned, sluggish and slightly thrown off by his question. The effects of the alcohol and muggle weed were hitting her. "No, never played, but I can ride a broomstick.""I'll bet you can," Zabini cracked himself up at his words, smacking his knee and throwing his head back. Nott snickered at his joke, exchanging an amused grin with Dahlia.She smirked, cocking a brow at them, "Honestly, if you knew me at all, you'd know I've probably shagged more girls than you."Nott fell out of his chair. Zabini choked on the swig of fireball he'd just taken."What?!""Come again?"Dahlia was amused now. She waved her hand, silently summoning her tequila bottle into her hand. The boys jolted a little again at her wandless magic, and she raised a brow at them as she lifted the bottle to her lips. "You already know I can do it, so I'm not going to bloody hide it," she says as though offended, taking a deep sip from the liquor bottle. "Are you honestly going to react like that every time?""Is it supposed to be a secret?" Nott gave her an interested look, leaning forward on his knees, his dark hair falling into his eyes. "Giving up secrets to the enemy, are we?"Dahlia's heart skipped a beat at his words, her conscious nagging her impaired mind that she was supposed to be keeping the extent of her powers incognito. She manages to not visibly wince, although she tenses slightly. "Honestly, yeah." Blast the alcohol, it made her honest.Nott's eyebrows disappeared in shock. Zabini seemed to have not recovered from Dahlia's previous statement, glancing at Nott as though he'd lost his mind."Are we not going to address what the bloody fuck she just said?" Zabini leaned over and smacked the back of Nott's head, hard. Nott yelped, immediately reaching to cup his stinging neck."Blood hell, mate - she said... what the fuck!" He rubbed his neck, glancing sourly at Zabini. "I was going to come back to it!"Zabini ignored him completely, turning his attention to Dahlia. She met his stare with a smirk on her face, enjoying the shocked expression he wore."You're a lesbian?" He whispered it as though it was the secret.Dahlia laughed, taking another shot as she rolled her eyes. "That wasn't the part of what I said that was a secret, dumbass.""So you're actually a lesbian?" Nott was looking at Dahlia with a new fascination. "Oh, this is brilliant!""Brilliant?" Zabini shot Nott a dark look. "How is this brilliant?""Oh, get over yourself, Blaise," Nott waved his hand as if dismissing him. "You're just upset because now you can't shag her."Dahlia choked on the liquor she'd been about to swallow. She coughed it down, spluttering slightly as she turned to give a pointed look at a now sheepish Zabini. She looked at him, deciding whether she wanted to hex him, or laugh.Before she knew it she was laughing so hard she fell out of her seat. Blame it on the weed, or the alcohol, or maybe just the fact that this was the most fucking fun she'd had in months. She wiped tears from her eye as she clawed her way back into her seat."I about peed my pants!" Dahlia gasped as she collapsed in her chair. Her odd statement caused Nott to snort, but when she looked up at Zabini he looked offended."What's got your wand in a knot?" she teased, reaching for the tequila once again.Zabini rolled his eyes and ignored her statement, so she turned to Nott. "What's your body count, Nott?"He shrugged, throwing her a dashing smile and a wink. "I don't kiss and tell."Dahlia rolled her eyes, "that's not fun.""So you'll kiss and tell?" Zabini suddenly looked interested in what she had to say. She suppressed a smirk, shrugging in response with an innocent smile."I think some feelings would be seriously hurt tonight if I were to kiss and tell," Dahlia said demurely as she spun the bottle around in her hands."I like her," Nott smirked, lifting his bottle in silent cheers to Dahlia. "This means we can go to the Three Broomsticks and you'll pick up girls with us?"Dahlia snorted, meeting Nott's grin with one of her own. "I've never been to the Three Broomsticks."Zabini about fell out of his chair in shock. He caught himself just before he tipped over, sloshing his firewhiskey on the ground. "You've never been to the Three Broomsticks?""Merlin's Beard, that's like a rite of passage!" Nott leaned forward, staring intently at her. "Now you have to go with us.""I mean, if I have to," Dahlia said with a shrug, laughing along with the boys. "Just don't get your feelings hurt if I get more girls than you.""Ooohh, it's like that?" Nott's eyebrows disappeared beneath the stray curls falling over his forehead. Dahlia relaxed - their light teasing put her at ease. She found herself genuinely enjoying herself; this pair of Slytherins wasn't half bad. Nothing at all like Malfoy.Dahlia just smirked back at him, tossing him a wink. She surveyed the room casually, still star-struck by the naturalistic beauty of it. The murky water were dark with the sun gone, leaving a mirage of mystic deepness around them."Can you talk to the mermaids?" Dahlia found herself asking the ridiculous question, but wasn't at all apologetic.Zabini snorted, "No, but they'll flip you off when they swim by.""We usually return the favor," Nott added with a smirk.Dahlia opened her mouth to retort back, but before she could speak someone stepped in through the wall. She felt another presence, body shifting to the entrance, tensing. Something told her any other Slytherins wouldn't take kindly to her presence in their common room. Her eyes flickered over to where a body was solidifying on the black marble floors in front of her. She froze in her seat, recognizing the voice that called out."Nott, Zabini," Malfoy nodded to both of them casually before doing a double take, the friendly look on his face fading into one of surprise and disbelief. "Dumbledore?""Malfoy," Dahlia greeted him cooly, giving him the briefest nod. The four of them sat in silence for a moment before Nott leaned back, glancing between Dahlia and Malfoy as though trying to decipher the tension."Well, it wasn't weird until now.""The bloody hell is she doing here?" Malfoy seemed to have recovered from his shock, turning indignantly to glare at Nott and Zabini. "Since when do we bring Gryffindors into Slytherin?!"Zabini opened his mouth to answer, but Malfoy wasn't done."Salazar's pants! There hasn't been a Gryffindor down here in like three centuries! What the fuck where y'all thinking?" Malfoy had strutted up to the table they were seated at, standing toe to toe with Nott who barely spared him a lazy glance."That's not true." Dahlia couldn't resist the giggle that escaped as Malfoy whirled to glare at her indignantly. She forced her face to return neutral, hiding the amusement in her expression. "Harry and Ron came in here second year!""They did what?" Malfoy was seething. He was visibly flustered; his cheeks a pale pink color, but his eyes were swirling with malice and fury."They brewed polyjuice potion and came in here. You brought them, actually," Dahlia giggled again when Nott met her gaze. His face was incredulous and so obviously trying to contain his mirth it made her laugh."They... I-" Malfoy whirled away from her, apparently determined to ignore her. "There hasn't been a Gryffindor willingly brought into Slytherin in three centuries! Why start tonight?"Nott rolled his eyes, pushing his chair back so that he could stand. "Mate, are you mad it's a Gryffindor, or that it's her?"Dahlia gawked at them, not understanding why she would make a difference before rolling her eyes and shrugging. "I don't know, Nott, I feel like he'd be a bit more peeved if you'd asked Ron or Harry to drink."Zabini snorted as he lifted the bottle to his lips. "She's got a point.""Why is she fucking here?!" Malfoy demanded, slamming his hand down on the table. He was visibly furious, face reddening, chest heaving. His grey eyes were simmering pools of fury, glaring fiercely at his fellow Slytherins."I'm here because they asked me," Dahlia offered, mimicking Nott's movements and standing to her feet. "We were having a good time before you showed up, actually."Malfoy spun around to face her, his face scrunched up as his eyes roamed up and down her body. He seemed to take in the way she swayed slightly on her feet, her flushed features. "You're knackered."Dahlia lifted her almost empty bottle, nodding enthusiastically. "I might be.""Me too," Nott lifted his own bottle to confirm her statement, nearly as empty as hers. "And she summoned muggle weed.""Who the hell even are you?" Malfoy snarled, looking at Dahlia in disgust. She took a step back at his disgust; the anger radiating off of him."Since when do you drink and smoke like a bloody Slytherin?""Maybe since I exploded your -" Dahlia snapped back, matching his anger.In a single second, Malfoy had taken a step towards, closing the distance between them. He slapped his hand over her mouth, his fingers digging into the side of your face aggressively. He pulled her close to him, his other hand gripping her hair in a tight grip. "Watch your mouth, mudblood."For a moment Dahlia didn't react, and then her amber eyes flashed with defiance. She opened her mouth, jaw closing down on his hand - hard. He released her with a shout, stumbling backwards enough to knock into Nott's chair. Her teeth left grooves in the soft flesh of his hand."What the fuck?!" Malfoy yelled as Dahlia calmly collected her wand and bottle, turning towards the door."I'm not a mudblood and you know it. Not that it should bloody matter if I was," Dahlia snarled at him, stopping at the wall they had entered through. She looked back to Nott, "Can I go back through without one of you or am I trapped here?""I'll walk you back," Nott lurched towards her, slightly off balance from alcohol, "You don't need one of us to leave, but you might get in trouble walking back to Gryffindor alone. If you're with an Inquisitorial squad member you can't get in trouble," he tapped his badge on his robes and wiggled his brows at he as he spoke.Dahlia giggled, rolling her eyes, "Oh, so noble - you should have been a Gryffindor."Theo clutched a hand over his heart, falling back and feigning injury dramatically. "You wound me, Dumbledore."Dahlia laughed at his display, but brushed him off nonetheless. "I'm going to take a passageway," Dahlia said dismissively, offering Nott a smile. "Appreciate it though. I had fun," she glanced towards Zabini, lifting her hand in a small wave. "We'll have to finish this another time. I do recall there being 20 galleons on the table."Zabini smirked, lifting his bottle in farewell. "Until next time, Dumbledore."Dahlia nodded back in agreement before winking at Nott. "Three Broomsticks sometime?"Nott's grin widened as he winked back. "You bet."Dahlia turned and stepped through the wall, the world fading into a shiny grey, but not before she heard Malfoy's enraged shout, "Are you going on a date -"

"Harry, we need to do actual duels," Dahlia murmured to him as they sat in the far corner of their common room. Ron and Hermione sat beside them, everyone acting as though they were doing anything but talking to each other. Hermione was distractedly doodling on a piece of parchment that was supposed to be her Potion's essay. Harry was studying a chocolate frog card, while Ron continued to shove Turkish Delight into his mouth while looking anywhere but at the three of them.The three of them were attempting to talk about Dumbledore's Army, but it was difficult to do with so many people milling around the room. She had attended several meetings, dedicating most of her evenings to it, and Dahlia was convinced that the members of Dumbledore's Army were ready for actual duels, not practice duels or simply performing the magic. They needed to be fully prepared for war, and that meant real dueling, with noise and distraction around them. Harry seemed to disagree, so Dahlia had decided to bring it up around Hermione, who was guaranteed to be on her side."What if someone gets hurt?" Harry hissed back, shooting her a sideways glance. "We can't go to Madam Pomfrey!""Harry, teaching them the spells doesn't help them if they freeze up in an actual duel.""She has a point," Hermione whispered, glancing up briefly from the small cauldron she had drawn on her parchment."You saw how it was in the..." Dahlia couldn't finish her sentence. Harry visibly tensed at her words, and Ron choked - she rarely mentioned the graveyard, so when she did it got their attention. "You know," Dahlia persisted, studying the back of Quidditch Through the Ages. She glared at Harry, refusing to back down, knowing she was right. "You even lost your wand," Dahlia reminded Harry.Harry shot her a silent glare. "I know," he ground out, settling his jaw into a firm line. "I-it's different, in real life," he whispered hauntingly, eyes zoning out as if replaying the duel in his mind."That's why we need to practice," Hermione whispered shakily, her eyes pinned to her parchment."They need to be comfortable hitting moving targets; taking on more than one opponent," Dahlia insisted, watching the vein in Harry's neck grow bigger with each sentence. "They need to be comfortable dueling with other duels happening around them - learning to be on guard all the time.""I'll think about it."Dahlia rolled her eyes, pushing up out of her seat. She didn't know why he was so against this, but she knew that was the best she would be able to get out of him. Even then, he might just be saying that to get her to back off. "I'm going to go for a walk."The trio watched her leave. Hermione regarded her curiously, while Ron seemed baffled by what had just transpired. Harry was obviously upset, but Dahlia refused to back down. Knowing the spells didn't mean that the members of Dumbledore's Army could perform them under stressful situations - didn't mean they could keep themselves alive in a fight.In order to know that, they needed to see them duel in real life scenarios. She didn't understand how Harry could be against that - minor injury now was worth not dying later.Dahlia was so busy fuming that she didn't realize where her feet had carried her to until she was on a random fifth floor corridor in the castle. She heard voices up ahead, quickly ducking behind a gargoyle as two Inquisitorial Squad members came around the corner.Dahlia relaxed when she heard Nott's voice carrying through the dark hallway, but immediately tensed at his words."He's going to pick one of us. It's only a matter of time.""Shhh!" Dahlia didn't recognize the other voice at first, but she instinctively leaned further into the gargoyle, willing herself to disappear into the shadows."Not if our father's succeed," the other voice argued, whispering. Dahlia strained, trying to put a name to the voice, but couldn't decipher it."You're willing to bet on that?" Nott argued bitterly. Their footsteps were drawing closer, but she couldn't see who the other person was; he was wearing Hogwarts uniform, that much was apparent, but his face was hidden in the shadows."They're looking for something," the other voice spoke, a voice she recognized but couldn't place."What if we found it for them?" Nott sounded desperately hopeful. "Better than becoming enslaved to a psychopath, right?""Or we interfere and get killed for it," the other voice hissed. "You should shut up. We have to focus anyways; Umbridge said something about needing the whole Squad for something."The boys passed by the gargoyle she was hiding behind in silence, Dahlia holding her breath until the sounds of their footsteps were long gone. Mentally she catalogued their conversation. What were their fathers looking for? Who was the he they spoke up? What was worth killing over? Dahlia was digesting their words as she made to move from behind the gargoyle when the sound of approaching footsteps had her ducking back behind it."Dahlia!" someone hissed at her, "it's just me!"Dahlia peeked from behind the gargoyle. "Harry?""Why are you hiding?" he asked curiously, walking closer to her."Nott and another Inquisitorial Squad member just walked by a few minutes ago. I thought you were them coming back.""Oh," Harry glanced around cautiously before meeting her eyes, voice sincere. "I'm sorry about earlier.""It's fine," Dahlia brushed him off, offering him a weak smile. "I shouldn't have pushed you so hard.""You're right though," Harry added remorsefully, somberly returning her smile.. "I did lose my wand in the fight with Voldemort and you had to give me yours to buy me time for me to get mine back.""Harry, I didn't mean it like that -" Dahlia started, brows furrowing quickly."I know," Harry interrupted firmly, silencing her as he continued.. "But you saved both of our asses that night. You were the only one prepared for a fight - you still are the only one, and you're right about everyone else needing to be prepared.""I'm not trying to be harsh," Dahlia whispered, her eyes lowering to her hands, blinking against the tears that threatened to pool. "I just can't watch anyone else die, Harry...""I know," Harry winced, looking away from her. He exhaled noisily, "I see it every night."Dahlia was silent for a moment before asking, "How's your Occlumency been?"Harry winced, looking up sheepishly. "I might have accidentally gotten inside Snape's head and he's refusing to give me lessons now."Dahlia gaped, smacking him on the arm. "Harry! You need those lessons!""I know," Harry said bitterly, shaking her hand off of his arm. "Do you think I like being connected to him?""No," Dahlia said immediately, looking at him apologetically. She knew better than to think he would enjoy the sick visions. The vision, the dreams that followed it, all of it haunted Harry; just like it did her. "No, that's not what I think at all."Harry took her words in silence, until Dahlia spoke again, trying to dig herself from the hole she'd created. "You know, I've been doing Occlumency lessons with Dumbledore. I can try to teach you, if you want.""Really?" Harry looked up, surprised. "Dumbledore's been teaching you?""Yeah, he said you might need help with it. Don't reckon he thought you'd get yourself kicked out of Snape's lessons, but at least he had some forethought in the matter.""Is that where you were the other night when you didn't get back until late?"Dahlia looked at him sharply, surprised he had even noticed her prolonged disappearance - which had been her Occlumency lesson, followed by drinking in the Slytherin common room with Nott and Zabini. "How do you know that?""Hermione mentioned it," Harry said with a shrug. He did give her a curious look, cross his arms as though informed that wasn't the whole story. His look caused Dahlia's heart to skip a beat in panic - what did he know."Hermione said you came back reeking of alcohol and tispy," Harry added, giving her a pointed look.Dahlia rolled her eyes, relief rushing through her - he didn't know where she'd been. "Yeah, I have lessons with him a couple times a week. I'm getting better at it, actually, but usually afterwards I need a drink or two.""That bad?" His voice implied he meant her memories, not the Occlumency itself.Dahlia winced, deciding it was pointless to try to hide her feelings from him; not about this, anyway. "Seems like the memories you least want to see are the first ones that come to mind.""Yeah..." Harry's voice trailed off into nothing, quieting for a second before whispering, "Do you see him?"His question threw her off; she gaped at him for a moment before shaking herself. She turned her head to face forward, staring at the wall in front of her. "Every night.""In my nightmares I hear your screams," Harry admitted, looking fleetingly at Dahlia before fixing his gaze on the same wall she stared at. Dahlia turned her head to glance at him questioning, prompting his explanation. "When you screamed for him to get up."Dahlia swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. Another person's screams echoed in her nightmares - the man she'd tried to save and couldn't. "I hear Arthur's."Harry winced, stealing a glance at her. "Guess we're more alike than we thought.""Besides not having parents, you mean?" Dahlia attempted a smile at her dark humor, and thankfully Harry offered her a smile of his own."Yeah, besides that. Were yours murdered though?"Dahlia laughed, emerging from behind the gargoyle with Harry behind her. "Honestly, I have no idea, but that'd be about the only acceptable excuse."Harry cracked a smile, his eyes twinkling with mirth. "You came back with a morbid sense of humor."Dahlia shrugged, "I take my laughs where I can get them." She sobered after saying that, realizing this was the first and probably only moment she would be able to get him alone."Harry, can you speak to snakes?" She decided to be blunt, to confirm Fred's words before confessing her own secret. The twins were known for their pranks, afterall.Harry's face turned pink, seeming embarrassed. He shuffled his feet unconsciously, weight transferring from foot to foot. "I - yeah, I'm a parseltongue," he admitted lowly, his entire demeanor changing."Prove it," Dahlia met his hard green eyes with a determined one of her own. "Prove you can understand me." The words fell from her lips, but not in English. Horrible rasps, tangled and garbled came from her throat - the language of the snakes.Harry paled in surprise, utter shock wracking his features. His jaw dropped, brows shot up, entirely stunned for a second before his jaw snapped closed - breaking out into an incredulous grin. "You're a parseltongue?""SHIETHHH," The rasp fell from Dahlia's lips. Yes."SSIESS?" Harry was still in shock, though a smile was forming on his face. Dahlia's lips turned upwards in response. How?"How are you one?" Dahlia countered in parseltongue, giving him a look. Harry seemed to realize that was a stupid question, his grin widening sheepishly. He was opening his mouth to respond when footsteps echoed from down the nearby corridor. Dahlia pulled him behind the statue, clapping a head over his mouth in a split second. They couldn't get caught."You've got to compartmentalize!" Dahlia huffed, groaning as her and Harry sat up from the ground. They'd been meeting twice a week in a classroom deep in the dungeons to practice his Occlumency for the past month, and he hadn't improved at all. So far she had been privy to some very handsy memories with Cho Chang, some very strange scenarios in the boys dormitory that she hadn't the courage to ask about, and a handful of other personal moments. She was getting quite sick of it, honestly."I did!""Okay, well choose any category that doesn't involve you without clothes!"Harry blushed, awkwardly avoiding her gaze as he pushed to his feet. Dahlia huffed, stomping over until she stood in front of him."Imagine you're in a filing cabinet, and you have to file each memory away. Lock certain drawers with information you don't want other people knowing - the more secret, the more locks. Add wards if you want to. Then push that one to the back of your mind.""I know, I know," Harry groaned, still rubbing his temples, "it's just not as easy to do in practice!""Trust me, I know," Dahlia rolled her eyes impatiently. "I had to take lessons for you, remember?""Oh, shut it. Same time next week?"Dahlia groaned, happy for the lesson to come to an end., "I suppose. I've got a bloody headache now.""Me too," Harry rubbed his neck as he made his way to the door. "I'm going to swing by the Infirmary and grab some Pain Relief potion. Want me to grab you some?"Dahlia nodded feverishly. "Yes, please.""Okay. I'll meet you back at the common room." Harry disappeared down the hallway without further word. Dahlia followed him a moment later, pausing only to pick up her wand and shoulder bag before leaving. She was on the grand staircase when a hand reached out from one of the landings and jerked her down the second floor corridor.Dahlia stumbled forward, plunging her other hand into her robes to pull her wand. She lit it wordlessly, pointing the tip into the pale face of a boy. Dahlia hesitantly lowered her wand, looking at the handsome Slytherin boy in front of her. He was flustered, grey eyes flashing angrily, breath heavy."What do you want, Malfoy?""Did you tell Nott and Blaise you're a lesbian?" His voice was cold, almost taunting. The directness of his questions threw her off.Dahlia wiped the shocked look from her face, suppressing a smile, managing to smirk at him instead. "I don't believe I actually said the word lesbian, but it was implied, yes.""What the fuck?" Malfoy's grip on her wrist intensified, pushing his body closer so they were nearly touching. Dahlia took a step back, finding herself against a wall. He followed her, growling, "What does that mean?"Dahlia jerked her wrist free of his grasp, stepping to the side and putting a few feet of space between them. Her heart was hammering - she hadn't thought it would irk him this much. Dahlia met his flashing grey eyes with a defiant gaze of her own, not ready to give up her charade just yet. "It means I like girls, Malfoy.""But -" Malfoy struggled for words, stomping towards her until he towered over her again. Dahlia refused to back down this time, planting her hands on her hips and staring back at him. "Then what the fuck was I?""A mistake?" Dahlia asked as though that should have been obvious. Malfoy recoiled, a hurt look flashing across his face before fury settled in."A mistake?" Malfoy echoed, his voice so low it was almost a growl. "You're saying I turned you into a lesbian?"Dahlia didn't bother to stifle the laugh that erupted from her throat. Her mirth seemed to confuse the Slytherin before her. "No!" Dahlia managed to gasp between laughs. "Fleur is responsible for that!""Fleur..." Malfoy;s face went from shocked to distant and cold in a split second. His jaw tightened, brows furrowing in disapproval as his eyes flashed with malice. "You fucked Fleur Delacour?"Dahlia's face turned smug. She shrugged innocently, "I might have.""You - Fleur - What?" Malfoy's eyes nearly bugged out of his head. He was so shocked al signs of anger left his body - he just stared, completely stunned. "I turned you into a lesbian?"Dahlia rolled her eyes, seeing the guilt settle in on him. She huffed, cursing herself for feeling bad about letting him feel guilty. "No, Malfoy, you didn't turn me into a lesbian. I like girls and boys," Dahlia replied snarkily, scowling at him. "Honestly, get over yourself."Malfoy's hands tightened into fists, his eyes filled with a deep emotion she didn't recognize. He seemed to internally debate his words before starting, "So, you've -""If you're going to ask me if I've fucked other girls, my response will be to tell you that you sound just like Nott."Malfoy growled low in his throat, his grey piercing eyes searching her face. That was entirely the opposite from what he had been going to ask her. Dahlia's indignance shadowed her foresight, clouding his true emotions from her. He tried again, "When you said you didn't wait...""Honestly, Draco, this again?" Dahlia rolled her eyes, glaring back at him, cutting him off. He was going to lecture her on how she didn't wait for him? When he was the one she had found fucking some skank in a hallway the day she returned? "You didn't wait either."Malfoy winced, his eyes looking away with a look that almost resembled shame. "Dahlia..."Dahlia sighed, her hands coming up to rub her temples, eyes fluttering closed. "I'm sorry I killed your uncle." The words spewed from her mouth before she could stop them.She didn't know where the apology came from; deep down inside she had always assumed that's why he'd pulled away. She couldn't blame him; she'd killed his family, even if his family had killed someone innocent. Malfoy must not have been expecting her to apologize - or he hadn't been expecting his uncle to come up.. His eyes flew wide and he stammered, "Wh- that's... what does that have to do with this?""That's why you pushed me away, isn't it?" Dahlia averted her eyes, trying to calm her racing heart from his proximity. He'd taken a step towards her, though his demeanor still remained guarded. His hands were shoved deep into his pockets, back straight as a knife. "Th-that night... I didn't hear from you after that night."Malfoy's face melted into one of incredulous shock, shoulders relaxing. "What the - no! Merlin's beard..." he dragged a hand down his face, clearly frustrated. Dahlia looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to finish his thought. She rocked back and forth nervously on her toes, twisting her fingers behind her back."You honestly thought it was because you killed Rudolphus?" Draco's voice was incredulous. He reached out, his hands came up to grip her forearms gently, forcing her gaze into his. His hands were tight enough to prevent her escape, but gentle enough not to hurt her. He almost seemed more hurt by her assumption than she was - the pain in his grey eyes piercing her to the core."Yes..." Dahlia admitted, so quietly he almost couldn't hear her speak. She maintained his gaze, though she wanted to shy away.Malfoy groaned, leaning forward so his forehead rested against her's. "I never gave a rat's ass about that bastard."Dahlia's eyes flew open wide and she scrambled for words, her mind muddled by his proximity. Her hands lifted until they were clutching his forearms back, her feet stepping forward until she was almost into his arms. She was so close he was pearing straight down at her, their joined hands falling away as he gently settled one hand around her waist. "Then what... then why?" She scrunched her face up, her eyes squeezed closed against tears that threatened to fall."I put you in danger," Malfoy said softly, his grey eyes suddenly hard. The hand at the small of her back grabbed her cloak into his fist for a moment - possessive and protective, pulling her into his chest for just a moment before releasing his hold. He took a step back from her, his words crashing reality back around them. "I'm not safe - my family isn't safe. I don't have a choice -""There's always a choice, Draco," Dahlia argued, her face transitioning into a scowl as she watched him retreat from her. He was doing it again - he was going to leave. That spurred anger in her, Dahlia's amber eyes flashing as she countered. "I did wait for you, by the way. I waited the entire night after I left Albus's office. I walked the corridors - the entire castle waiting for you. And even at Beauxbatons I waited! I waited for a letter. I waited for an owl. I waited for a sign from Merlin himself that you would show up in some way because I needed you."Her eyes were filled with tears now, and she made no effort to stop them from falling. Draco took two steps towards her, no longer retreating as words continued to fall from her lips. "I was sent on a mission," Dahlia said softly, choking on the emotion, "one that didn't go as planned. If you knew - If you found out who I was... what I did..." Dahlia shuddered, turning her back to him. "I'm the one that isn't safe for you, Malfoy.""Dahlia..." Malfoy reached for her but she flinched away from his touch."All I needed was a letter, Malfoy." Her voice was hard again, all signs of emotion gone. She turned around to pin him with an agonized look. "I needed... fuck, I needed a person.""Why didn't you write to me?" His voice was raspy, thick.Dahlia's eyes lit up, fury dancing in the amber pools. She took a step towards him threateningly - finger jabbing into his chest "Because you walk away after everything, Draco! I'd just killed your uncle. I had to respect the fact that you probably didn't want to speak to me!" Her voice was reaching a screech level. "So I waited. All night that first night. Then day after day. Month after month."Draco drew in a ragged breath, her words hitting him like knives. His mind spun wildly - she'd waited for him that first night? Gone searching for him? Hope rose in his chest that was quickly extinguished by fury. His face contorted, forming a scowl. Didn't she understand who his family was? Shouldn't she have some idea as to why he couldn't have risked writing her? Anger fired up deep in his belly, his grey eyes flashing. A deeper emotion flared inside him - one that felt too close to regret to examine."Did you ever stop to think that maybe I was protecting you? That if I were to write to you it would be the same as writing your obituary?!" He roared, hands curling into fists as he glared daggers at her. Dahlia gaped at him before her lip curled up into a sneer so like his own."Oh yes, fucking skanks in hallways is the ultimate protection!" She laughed, a mirthless, humorless laugh that left him empty inside. "Did you ever stop to think that I needed protection where I was? Or that maybe I never asked for your protection at all in the first place?!" Dahlia's eyes flashed almost red with her anger. She spun on her heel, marching away from the furious Slytherin. "I won't chase after you, Draco Malfoy!" She yelled over her shoulder. "Fuck off!"Dahlia stormed away, intending to head straight back to her common room after her run-in with Malfoy, but as she passed by the Library she noticed a light in the far corner near the study tables. The Library had been closed for the past two hours, so her curiosity got the best of her as she detoured. Her feet carried her soundlessly through the vast room until she was looking at a student, asleep on top of a pile of books and parchment.Dahlia smiled softly, knowing the feeling all too well. She gently approached them, reaching a hand out to give the student's shoulder a shake. It was a Slytherin, judging by the insignia on their sweater."Huh?" A very sleepy Theodore Nott sat up, looking at her through half open eyes as she shook him a little more forcefully."Nott?" Dalia squinted at him, checking to make sure her eyes weren't betraying her "Why're you asleep in the Library?"Nott groaned, rubbing his eyes as he leaned back and stretched, yawning. "Shitty day. Didn't want to go back to Slytherin and deal with -" he cut himself off, sending her a sharp look."If it's Malfoy you're avoiding he's not in Slytherin, he just pinned me down and asked me if I was a lesbian not even ten minutes ago on the second floor." Dahlia returned his sharp look with a knowing one of her own.Nott cracked a small smile at her attempt at a joke. "Yeah, he didn't believe me when I told him."Dahlia laughed, dropping down into the seat across from him. She knew eventually she'd have to set the record straight and clarify that she's bi but it was too much fun. Instead she turned the topic back to him, crossing her arms and leaning back. "Why are you avoiding Malfoy?""Who says I'm avoiding Malfoy?" His words were guarded, his laughing demeanor tensing."I do," Dahlia shrugged casually, hoping to coax the truth out of him. "Who wouldn't want to avoid Malfoy?""Fair point," Nott seemed more awake now, regarding her curiously. He was on guard still, though his demeanor had relaxed. "He does seem to hate you, doesn't he?"Dahlia shrugged, her gaze holding the Slytherin's. "I'll tell you why he hates me if you tell me why you're avoiding him."Nott seemed to debate her offer for a few long moments, but his curiosity must have won out because he smirked, planting his arms on the table between them and leaning forward. "You first.""Fine," Dahlia smiled sweetly, smirking at Nott. "He probably hates me because we had a thing last year, and I got sick of his games and told him to fuck off. Multiple times, actually - the most recent being tonight."Nott snorted at the news, eyes flying wide. His brows puckered as he considered the thought. "No way... you and Malfoy?"Dahlia waved her hand dismissively, rolling her eyes as her cheeks flushed. "It wasn't anything serious - only made out a few times.""Interesting," Nott observed her as if suddenly seeing her in a new light. "That's why he hates you. So... not a total lesbian?"Dahlia smiled, shaking her head, ignoring the lingering question to ask what he meant by that's why Draco hates her. "Not a total lesbian, but Malfoy's a total git."Nott barked a laugh, leaning forward even more. "So, you and Malfoy? What happened?""He has a habit of not speaking to me for weeks on end after petty arguments, and screwing skanks in hallways." Dahlia's words were bitter, but her voice lacked the usual bite. "He also goes months without speaking or writing to me as though I'm of no consequence to him."Nott whistled, his brow cocked at her. "I'm assuming the 'months without speaking or writing' is referring to your mysterious disappearance after the tournament?"Dahlia shot him a poisonous glare. "And Christmas break, thank you very much. For the record, Malfoy was supposed to wait for me outside the Headmaster's office that night. If he had actually done what he said he would he would have been allowed to know where I was going."Nott seemed surprised by her words, rubbing his jaw in his hand. "So, you would have trusted him?"Dahlia hesitated, thrown off by his question. She hadn't really thought about it like that. "I mean... I would - I guess, yes, a year ago I would have trusted him.""Why not now?""He broke my trust! And then has spent the past five months I've been back either ignoring my presence or been a complete asshole!" Dahlia slammed her hand down on the table, rattling the ancient furniture. "I wish I knew what the hell was going on with him.""No, you don't," Nott muttered darkly. He glanced up in shock, clearly having meant to keep his comment to himself."Nott..." Dahlia glared at him. Her mind flashed back to the conversation she'd over heard behind the gargoyle - the conversation about his father. Could Draco's father be involved too? Is that was was happening? She watched as Nott silently struggled, her heart pounded in her chest in anticipation."Everyone has secrets, Dumbledore." Nott glared back at her, refusing to say more."Fine. Your turn. Why are you avoiding Malfoy?" Dahlia prompted, admitting defeat and switching topics. He still owed her one explanation.Nott hesitated, his eyes wandering as he collected his thoughts. "Our fathers made some bad decisions - decisions that affect us, and I suggested we help them."Dahlia cocked an eyebrow at him. So it did involve both of their fathers. For a second Dahlia considered that maybe Malfoy had been the other person in the corridor that night, though she'd like to think she would have recognized his voice. "And he got mad that you want to help your dad?" She leaned forward, suddenly invested in the conversation. "Does this have to do with why he disappeared on me?"Nott shrugged, avoiding her eye as he answered. "It's not going to matter in the end."Dahlia was silent for several moments before speaking quietly. Intuition told her there was more at play than she knew here, but pressing Nott for answers wouldn't get her anywhere. Nott looked hopeless - as though he had resigned himself for defeat. She recognized the look all too well - she wore it herself too often. "You ever get the feeling that the war is coming, and you aren't going to survive it?"Nott's gaze jerked to her, her question jolting him, his eyes wide in horror before swallowing and nodding slowly. "That's how all of us feel."Dahlia nodded, her eyes wandering around to the shelves. She wondered exactly who us was to him. She pushed her chair back, standing to her feet so she could pace up and down the nearby shelves, gathering her thoughts. "Do you want to drink?"Nott let out a huff, watching as she perused the aisle of books. "I never say no to a drink."Dahlia distractedly waved her hand in his direction, conjuring a bottle of fireball wordlessly on the table. He eyed the bottle in front of him for a moment before shooting her a doubtful glance. "Thought you didn't drink firewhiskey?""I'll make an exception tonight," Dahlia turned to wink at him. "You seem like you need to drink more than I do, so we'll drink your stuff tonight."Nott accepted her deal and uncapped the bottle, lifting it in a toast. "To surviving the war."Dahlia winced at his words, but drank when he passed the bottle to her. They sat there in silence for several long minutes, the bottle passing between them, both lost in thought. Mind wandering, Dahlia's eyes drifted over a strange insignia on one of his notebooks - it looked like a coat of arms. She tilted her head so she saw it from the correct angle, throat tightening. It was the Nott House coat-of-arms. Mentally, Dahlia slapped herself. Nott was from one of the Sacred 28 families - his records would be extensive. Perhaps he could help her. "Can I ask you a question?"Nott seemed surprised, but agreed. "Shoot.""You're a pureblood, right? Your family is one of the Sacred 28?"Nott's forehead wrinkled as though he'd never been asked that before. "Technically, yeah. My house is one of the newer ones - not like the Prewetts or the Malfoys.""But you would have a Nott Genealogy Record?" Dahlia pushed on, encouraged by his response."I'm sure there's one somewhere in the library," Nott conceded, confused by the way her face lit up. He regarded her curiously, "What could you possibly want with my family records?""I'm looking for my parents," Dahlia admitted, hoping he wouldn't push for more information. It had beene enough to stop Fred from snooping any further. "Or any information on them, actually.""Okay..." Nott leaned forward, his dark eyes focused on her. "What aren't you telling me?"Dahlia leaned back, tensing at his words but outwardly trying to remain calm. Slytherins. She should have known they wouldn't be so noble as to leave her secrets alone. "I don't have anything to really go off of - I was abandoned as a baby. I figured if I could find one of the Sacred 28s records it would at least give me a starting point. People to investigate - bloodlines to focus on."Nott's eyes narrowed, logically asking, "How do you know your parents aren't muggles?""I had it tested. My magical signature matches several houses, so my parents have to be magical." Dahlia held her breath, silently cursing herself for starting this conversation. She knew nothing about him - didn't trust him at all, yet she had the gall to ask for his Genealogy Records thinking he wouldn't push her for more information?"Does it match my house and that's why you're asking me?" He seemed suddenly curious, leaning forward eagerly. "Are you my long lost cousin? I wouldn't be opposed to that, you know know. Always wanted a gay cousin."Dahlia laughed, shaking her head. "I wish, but no. What would Draco Malfoy think of you admitting to wanting to be related to me?""To hell with what Malfoy thinks," Nott said dismissively, eyes twinkling. "He's the one you should be asking for records, you know. His family history goes back centuries further than mine.""Right, because if I ask he'll just willingly hand it over to me.""Fair point." Nott took another swig of the bottle, looking at her curiously. "You're a puzzle, Dumbledore."Dahlia did her best to look innocent as she took the bottle from his hands. "I don't know what you mean.""You have secrets," Nott looked at her knowingly. "I know you do.""We all have secrets," Dahlia reminded him, her eyes growing colder. If he expected her to respect his privacy he would need to learn to drop the nosy questions, or she'd start firing off ones of her own.Nott nodded in agreement, leaning back in his seat. She met his gaze in silence, not back down but not challenging him either. They sat in silence, caught up in the secrets that hung in the air but could not be voiced."Teach me to do wandless magic."Dahlia did a double take, looking at him sharply. "Come again?""Teach me," Nott repeated. "There's a war coming, and I've never even been in a duel. If I lose my wand, I need to be able to do something."Dahlia's breath caught in her throat at his words; reality slamming down around her. Theodore Nott was asking for her to train him. The son of a death eater is asking for her to teach him to survive. The son of a death eater... the thought brought clarity on another situation. Nott's father was a death eater, which meant that whatever he was searching for was probably in the name of the Dark Lord.Dumbledore's words flashed through her head - the word he'd spoken before sending her on her mission. The Sorcerer's Stone - the reason she'd been sent to Beauxbatons. Dumbledore feared that Voldemort would go looking for it again. Is that what Nott's father was searching for?Horror flashed across Dahlia's face when another realization crashed down on her: She and Nott would be enemies in the war. Dahlia caught herself mid-though, shame flushing across her face when she reminded herself she wouldn't be permitted to fight in the war. That thought brought on defiance. She was a kid - they were kids - Cedric had been a kid. War shouldn't be something they worried about - it shouldn't be the burden they had to bear. Death shouldn't be imminent. Tears filled her eyes as she realized that people around her were going to die, regardless of what side they were on, and she couldn't stop it."I know what I'm asking you when I say that," Nott spoke quietly, not meeting her eyes, seeing her internal struggle. "I know that when we meet on the battlefield it won't be as friends." He did look up then, his green eyes meeting hers. "Not all of us have a choice."Dahlia choked on her words as she opened her mouth to speak, closing it again. She swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry. "I don't want you to die in the war."Nott looked at her in surprise. "Is that a yes?" He asked slowly, cautiously.Dahlia hesitated before nodding slowly. "I'll teach you... if you get me your records."Nott's face twisted from surprise into a smirk. "Manipulation? My, my, my, you should have been a Slytherin.""Surprisingly, that isn't the first time I've been told that." Dahlia pushed to her feet, smirking back at him. She turned away before he could see the tears that had threatened to overflow. "I've got a bloody headache so I'm going up to my common room.""I'll see you around, Dumbledore.""See you around, Nott."A week passed by and they were nearing the end of the semester. Only about three weeks remained before exams, and Dahlia was drained. Classes were a nightmare - Umbridge especially. She had fired the Divination Professor, and then taken to creating as many new decrees for the students to follow. Students weren't allowed within six inches of each other, Hogsmeade trips had been banned, quidditch had been cancelled. Life at Hogwarts was unrecognizable; the only thing Dahlia took remote pleasure in was Dumbledore's Army. They had a meeting that night, and Dahlia was eagerly waiting in the Room of Requirement.Harry had finally agreed to allow her to teach in a real duel scenario. She was so excited she had made sure to arrive at the Room of Requirement an hour before everyone else, focused on creating a realistic environment to teach in.The Room had outdone itself. It had morphed into a large wooded area, providing a small clearing that would serve as an arena in which to practice. Tall trees and rocks scattered what was a small forest area, expanding deep enough that Dahlia hadn't dared wander too far past the tree line. There were outposts in the high trees for long range practice, with an open space in the middle for open dueling. In the corner along the only stone wall of the castle, near the door, was a large medicine cabinet stocked with any healing potion and book needed, just in case. Harry had insisted they be prepared to handle any injury that might occur.With ten minutes to the start of the meeting, students were slowly starting to file in. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were amongst the first to arrive, followed by Neville, Luna, Seamus, and the rest of the Weasley's. Gryffindor house followed not far behind. A few minutes later all fifty students were present, and Harry addressed the group."We're going to do something a little differently tonight. Dahlia pointed out that while we have all mastered defensive and offensive spells, we have yet to put it to the test in actual duels."Gasps went up from the group, eyes lighting up in anticipation. Dahlia suppressed a smile; she'd had a feeling the group would take well to it."Tonight we'll start easy," Dahlia explained, stepping forward. "It's one thing to duel someone in a silent room, one on one. It's another thing to duel someone - or multiple someones - with others fighting around you. You have to be aware of everything that surrounds you; not just who you are dueling. A stray curse from another duel could hit you, and you'd be done."Silence washed over the group as Dahlia spoke, students clinging to her every word. She felt the weight of her words was over the group, pausing afterwards to allow them to take effect. She hated the fear that crept into the group, her words making their preparations become real. Dahlia swallowed, heart heavy with the knowledge that what they learn tonight will get put to applicable use. The knowledge that everyone in the room tonight would have to fight for their lives at some point - that the world out there was indeed that dangerous."Is that what happened to Cedric?" A soft voice spoke up, jerking Dahlia from her dark thoughts. Her eyes widened, searching the group in front of her until they met the saddened eyes of Cho Chang. The Ravenclaw's face was flushed - it was apparent she hadn't meant to voice her words."No," Dahlia surprised herself and everyone else by answering. She hadn't ever truly spoken of what had happened in the graveyard - except for the audited version she'd told her guardian that night. "No, a death eater got him with an Avada."Harry looked at her in shock, though his face quickly sobered as he nodded, endorsing he words. Encouragement to speak about it if it felt right. Dahlia blushed; that was the most she'd said about Cedric's death since the night it had happened - more than she'd ever said in front of so many people. Cho seemed to be clinging onto her every word."Did you kill him?" A Hufflepuff boy spoke up, looking at Dahlia with wide, reverent eyes. For a split second, raw hatred shot through Dahlia's heart at the look of hero worship displayed in the third-years face. The way he looked up to her as though she was a role model - it made her sick. Dahlia swallowed, ears ringing as she jerked away, glancing at Harry."She just said a death eater killed Cedric!" Harry snapped harshly, glaring at the boy who spoke."No, no, I didn't mean..." the boy blushed, cowering under Harry's glare. "I meant did she kill the death eater."Dahlia stiffened, turning to face the group. She felt Harry watching, waiting for her response. Dahlia inhaled deeply; she'd all but screamed that she had in front of the entire Dining Hall. Was that not enough? Apparently not, as all fifty of them were glued to her; even Harry was watching her, waiting for her next move."Yes," Dahlia's eyes met Cho Chang's. Her chest shuddered with her admission, though she held her head high. She was a murderer, yes, but she'd avenged Cedric - and for that, she would not apologize. "Yes, I killed the man who killed Cedric."For a moment no one spoke. Dahlia held her breath, terrified what their response would be as her heavy words hung in the air. Then Cho Chang let out a breath and stepped forward. She put her arms around Dahlia's neck and pulled her into an embrace. Dahlia was so shocked she didn't move for a moment, then her arms circled Cho's waist and she embraced her back."I tried to save him," Dahlia whispered to the girl as Cho clung to her. She choked back the tears that sprung into her eyes at her admission."Thank you for avenging his death," The slim Ravenclaw girl whispered back before releasing her with a sad smile as tears fell down her cheeks."Right," Harry coughed awkwardly, interrupting their moment. "Seeing as there aren't any more questions, why don't we partner up and get started?"Regretfully, the group broke off into their warm up groups, spreading out across the clearing.An hour passed by, during which Dahlia was pleasantly surprised with the progress everyone made. Colin Creevy managed to break his arm, and Fred stunned his twin with a spell so strong they had to lay George down for half an hour - all quickly cured, thanks to Harry's well stocked medicine cabinet and textbooks. Other than that, everyone did surprisingly well. Harry had limited the duels to stinging hexes, levitation spells, stunners, and disarming charms only. Nothing that could cause serious damage.Dumbledore's Army did shockingly well at one-on-one duels. Neville required a moment to adjust to watching his entire surroundings. He tripped over Eloise McKinnon twice, accidentally stunned Hermione's dueling partner from across the room, and failed to block two jelly-leg jinxes that rebounded from other duels. Everyone else was surprisingly adept, only a few others getting caught off guard by rebounding spells. They did so well, that Dahlia decided to go ahead and introduce two on one duels. They had just organized into two on one duels when the room shuddered as though a bomb had gone off in the castle. The stone wall rumbled, the door shaking on its hinges. Everyone froze, heads spinning around in an attempt to locate the source."What was that?" Dahlia locked eyes with Harry, instantly on guard. She'd lived in this room for nearly fifteen years and never once had anything been powerful enough to shake its walls. Harry shook his head grimly, hand gripping his wand as he turned in a full circle. Another exploding rippled through the room, causing the wall with the door to shake harder, small pebbles coming loose and falling onto the ground."Harry..." Dahlia's voice held a warning note. She moved so she was at the front of the group, Harry to her right and the weasley twins to her left. Ron and Hermione flanked them, faces pale but determined."Wands at the ready," Harry called back to the group. Collectively fifty wands were raised, students facing in all directions, guarding each other's backs.Dahlia's eyes were flying around the room, trying to comprehend what was happening. Nothing had ever shaken the walls like this - not once in all her years of living in it. It always opened at her command, appearing when requested. Dahlia froze - but what if it had? She'd asked the Room for somewhere undetectable, unplottable, somewhere undiscoverable. Even with all that - it did still have a physical wall holding it to the castle - the wall that didn't morph into a forest. A wall that could ultimately be blown up.Dahlia's heart stopped. Someone was trying to blow the wall up to force themselves into the room. "Watch the door!" she called to Harry, squaring her shoulders. Dahlia stepped out of their formation, pointing her wand at the ground as she ran around the group in a large circle."Protego Totallum, Protego Maxima, Repello Inimicum," Dahlia muttered spells as she walked around the circle, a purple light shining on the ground, marking the magical barrier she'd created. If someone was trying to break into the Room, it wasn't for good reasons. Dumbledore's Army was decent at duels, but she didn't anticipate their dueling knowledge coming in handy this soon.Another explosion shook the room, the floor quivering with the force, causing Dahlia to stumble as she returned to her place at the front of the group."What was that?" Harry shot her a glance as stones from the ceiling began to fall, larger this time, dirt obscuring the air around them."Protection spells," Dahlia answered, rolling up the sleeves of her shirt with shaking hands. "As long as we stay in the circle - and the spell isn't dark magic - it can't penetrate it.""For how long?" Harry asked her grimly."Haven't the slightest idea," Dahlia admitted, the room shaking with an explosion so strong the tremors forced her to lose her footing, falling to the ground. Fred helped her up, his face tight with worry. She brushed him off, training her wand on the door, glancing sharply to the boys at her sides. Whoever was trying to break in was determined - and apparently lacked any sense of caution."Should we just try to leave and make a run for it?" Ron asked nervously, hand gripping his wand so tight his fingers were white."We don't know what's out there," Harry argued sensibly. "I'd feel better about this if we didn't have third years here."Dahlia groaned - she'd completely forgotten about the younger students. She bit her lip, thinking hard of a way to get everyone out - a way that didn't involve the door. Fifteen years in this room and she had to have learned something useful about it! An idea popped into Dahlia's head. "Wait! Tippy! Milly!" She screamed into the air, looking around."Who -""Tippy! Milly!" Dahlia yelled loudly, glancing around the room desperately. A loud pop! Echoed through the room, and suddenly two wizened house elves stood before them. Both obviously females, dressed in bright pink tea dresses and matching bows on their ears."Mistress Dahlia called?" The older looking one with droopy ears asked, her voice raspy."Oh, thank Merlin!" Dahlia dropped her to knees to embrace the small elves before her. "Can you apparate students out of here?""Oh, yes, Tippy can take students!" The house elf on the right, younger with perky ears, clapped her hands. "Professor Umbridge won't be happy when she sees that mistress has been dueling in here!"Dahlia's eyes flew wide, face paling as she gaped at her elf. "You mean it's Umbridge out there trying to get in?""Mistress must leave!" Milly insisted, grabbed Dahlia's hand in her gnarled one urgently, tugging on her arm. "Milly will take Mistress to her room!""No, no, Milly, not me," Dahlia gently pulled her hand out of the house elf's grasp. "I need you to take the younger students."She led the house elves toward the Creevy brothers who were standing with two Hufflepuff third years, and a second year Ravenclaw. The elves continued to disagree, insisting on taking Dahlia away from danger. Dahlia ignored them, smiling gently down at them. Milly and Tippy had been the elves in charge of her upbringing when Dumbledore wasn't around. They'd spent nearly as many years in the Room of Requirement with her, feeding and changing her as a baby, playing and entertaining her as a young child."Is everyone else here fourth year and up?" Dahlia glanced around the group, pulling herself away from her trip down memory lane, searching each face for anyone younger than her. When everyone nodded that they were, Dahlia turned to her house elves, kneeling down so she was level with them."Please, take them back. Umbridge does horrible things, Tippy, and they need to get out of here." She spoke earnestly, gravely as she begged the creatures.Tippy's eyes swelled up with tears as she sniffed. "Tippy knows. Tippy hates the pink lady. Please let Tippy take Mistress back too!"The room shook threateningly, the door's hinges creaking. Dahlia steadied herself, reaching out to ensure Milly didn't tumble. Once the tremors stopped Dahlia gave Tippy a slight nudge toward the younger students. "I can't leave, Tippy. Please take them back! Hurry!"With a sniff, Tippy obeyed, grasping the Creevy brothers by the hands. Milly took the Hufflepuff students in one hand, the Ravenclaw in the other."Mistress is a good girl," Milly said tearfully, fixing her sorrowful eyes on Dahlia. "Milly will make sure to burn Umbridge's food."Dahlia cracked a smile. "That would be great, Milly."With a loud pop! The house elves disappeared, taking the younger kids with them. Dahlia returned to the front of the group, meeting Harry's curious stare. Hermione and Ron were staring at her, jaws gaping open in shock."They aren't my elves!" Dahlia said defensively, catching Hermione's accusing glare. She took her place beside Harry, lifting her wand towards the door. "They work for Hogwarts - they're paid to work here," Dahlia added. Hermione's indignant glare receded at her words, attention shifting back to the wall.Before they could continue to argue, the door and the wall surrounding it were blown up, rocks, stone and debris flying into the room. Dahlia hit the ground, arms over her head in an attempt to block the wreckage. She vaguely heard someone shout a spell. A huge shield erupted over their heads, and Dumbledore's Army staggered to their feet, wands raised."Tsk, tsk, tsk," Umbridge's heels clicked into the room, though the dirt and dust in the air obscured her from sight. "What have we here?"Dahlia's grip tightened on her wand. Inquisitorial Members were filing into the room - she could hear their footsteps. Dahlia estimated the Inquisitorial Squad had about twenty members, plus Umbridge. She had nearly fifty backing her. Dahlia tried to contain her smirk; she liked their odds."Grab them," Umbridge said sweetly, and the Inquisitorial Squad surged forward. Out of the corner of her eyes Dahlia saw Nott and Zabini heading towards two of the older Ravenclaws. Dahlia didn't know who fired the first hex - it might have been her - but seconds later spells were flying everywhere. Dahlia was dueling three seventh year Slytherin's she didn't recognize. Umbridge herself wasn't in the duels, but Dahlia was determined to fight her way towards her.The fighting went on for several minutes - chaos reigned. Dahlia blocked more spells than she threw, going on the defensive to protect her fellow DA students from stray spells they didn't see coming. One night of dueling hadn't been nearly enough - they were holding their own, but barely. The rebounding spells were the most dangerous - Dahlia had barely saved herself from two stunners that had been deflected by a nearby duel. Dahlia had just blocked Fred Weasley from getting petrified when she heard a voice scream, "Saeclum Nihilest!"A dark midnight blue spell erupted from Goyle's wand and was flying towards George Weasley. He was turned the other way, dueling Adrian Pucey. The magic in the room shifted - Dahlia could feel the weight of the dark spells, the evil intent behind it. She screamed in defiance; threw herself forward in attempt to jump in front of him - to block the spell with her body. Every ounce of her being screamed that the spell was dark magic. She didn't know how she knew it; it was like she could sense the magic. She knew she couldn't block the spell with her body in time; desperate, she threw her wand out, no spell coming to mind yet a bright white light erupted from it. Her light spell collided with Goyle's dark spell, absorbing it before the light spell returned to Dahlia, submerging into her wand.She didn't have time to question what had happened - didn't have time to process the shocked face of George as he spun around."No!" Dahlia brandished her wand at Goyle to send him flying backwards into the wall, sinking to the ground unconscious. She spun around, the attention of everyone in the room on her. She waved her wand threateningly at nearby Inquisitorial Squad members, anger radiating off of her, amber eyes turning nearly red with fury. "You dare to use dark magic?!" She yelled defiantly, daring someone to step forward.For a split second no one reacted, then Harry chose that moment to stun his opponent, using the distraction Dahlia had created. Chaos broke loose. Spell after spell was thrown, most at Dahlia who erected a powerful protego that ricocheted the curses back at the caster. She watched as two Inquisitorial members took down Ron, Harry turning to help him before Dahlia could."Run for it!" Dahlia screamed, shoving Hermione towards the door. "Fucking run!" Dahlia screamed, aiming her wand at Crabbe and getting him with a stinging hex. Dumbledore's Army bolted, all remaining members rushing towards the door. Dahlia held back, making sure all the students were in front of her before starting to fight her way towards the door.Dahlia had almost made it to the door when something collided into her from behind, and her world dissolved into darkness.

"-told you he was creating an army!""It's not Dumbledore's! It's my army! I started it!" Dahlia recognized Harry's voice through the fogginess of her mind. It was hoarse, as though he'd been shouting for some time."Then why doesn't it say 'Potter's Army'?" a shrill voice rang out, causing Dahlia to wince at the high pitch.Dahlia's eyes fluttered open, her surroundings immediately becoming familiar. She was seated in a chair in the headmaster's office, her wrists were tied behind her back, and her head was pounding. The soft candle lights hurt pierced her eyes, intensifying her headache. Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, while the Minister of Magic and Umbridge argued loudly against the headmaster and Harry. Harry was standing, the side of his face dripping blood, hands held behind his back. An older Slytherin held him roughly, fighting Harry's efforts to get free.For a moment Dahlia was confused on what had happened, and then it hit her in one horrible, reality shattering moment. Umbridge exploding into the Room of Requirement; Goyle using dark magic; everyone running for the door... Dahlia winced as the voices around her grew louder, fighting over who had organized Dumbledore's Army."It's my army," Dahlia's voice was raspy, dry and low. No one appeared to have heard her, so she spoke again louder, more demanding. "It's my army."All eyes immediately turned to her, voices dying off. Dahlia tried to sit up straighter, forcing her face to contort into a painless mask of fury. She lifted her head high, looking straight into the eyes of her least favorite professor."I beg your pardon?" Delores Umbridge turned to face her, a cruel smile on her lips."You seem to forget that Albus isn't the only one with the surname Dumbledore," Dahlia replied haughtily, turning her nose up at the horridly pink woman. She rarely flaunted her last name, being that it wasn't her true name, but she wouldn't give Delores the pleasure of pinning this on her guardian, despite their issues at the moment."You're saying you created this army?""Well it became evident my first class with you that you are not capable of performing even the simplest of shield charms, so I took it into my own hands to ensure my fellow classmates don't enter a war unprepared." The ropes around Dahlia's wrist snapped, and she stood, flexing her wrists as she did so. Dahlia's eyes scanned the room, noting almost all the Inquisitorial Squad members were present.Her eyes landed briefly on Nott and Zabini, who were pointedly looking anywhere but at her. She scowled - she'd deal with them later. Malfoy stood rigid, his grey eyes piercing her unwaveringly. She froze under his scrutiny, melting under the fear and regret pooling in his eyes. His features hardened when her eyes lifted to meet him, but he didn't look away. She broke their gaze, forced herself to continue looking around the room, her eyes falling on Goyle who was half hidden behind the door."You!" Dahlia snarled, marching towards him. Anger boiled deep inside her - he'd tried to kill George. Goyle recoiled, stumbling back and pushing Crabbe out in front of him. Dahlia shoved the larger boy out of her way as she advanced on Goyle. "I swear, on Merlin's fucking wand, I am going to k-"Someone was behind her, pinning her arms behind her back. Instinctively Dahlia threw her head backwards, head butting the person before she willed her magic to her hands. She felt a burst of magic leave her, and the person behind her yelped in pain. The hands holding her released her, and she whirled around.Nott was recoiling from her, shock and pain written on his face. Dahlia felt a pang of regret, but dismissed it as she whirled back around to Goyle, continuing her threat. "You used dark magic," she growled, advancing slowly on him. Goyle whimpered, cowering by the door."Mmhmm!" Umbridge tsked, but Dahlia ignored her. She grabbed Goyle's collar, jerking him to his feet. She slammed him against the wall, her wand digging into the throbbing vein in his neck."It won't be today, and it won't be tomorrow, but one day soon, Goyle, you and I will meet on opposite sides of this war. And on that day, I swear on my magic, I will decimate you." She twisted his shirt tighter until she felt it pressing against his windpipe, the Slytherin spluttering and gasping for air. "War is coming for all of us, Gregory Goyle," she snarled, nose to nose with him as she glowered. He was trying to cower away from her, but she forced his beady eyes to look into her own as she sneered at him. "But I'm coming for you."Dahlia released the blubbering boy, and turned back around to face the headmaster and the Minister of Magic. She brushed her clothes off, pinning a falsetto smile on her face. "Did you need something, Delores?""That's Professor Umbridge to you!""Calling you a professor would insinuate that I have learned something in one of your classes this year, which unfortunately, would be false." Dahlia mimicked the false, twisted smile the Defense professor wore so smugly as she strode forward until she stood directly in front of the desk - in front of Harry. "And, as you've inscribed in me and Harry, I must not tell lies."Umbridge openly gawked at Dahlia before turning to the Minister of Magic, red faced and spluttering. "I told you, Cornelius, she is a problem child. But to the matter at hand, Albus has formed an army - just as I told you!""It's my army!" Dahlia and Harry both roared at the same time."Dahlia," Albus spoke quietly, "it's quite alright.""No!" Dahlia cried, trying to move forward around the desk - trying to get to him - but found herself being restrained again. She glanced over her shoulder to find Nott and Zabini both holding her back. Nott caught her eye and gave his head a minuscule jerk to the side - a message to not resist."Albus!" Dahlia cried, struggling against the strong arms that restrained her. She baulked at the tears that threatened to overflow. Desperation clawed at her; if Albus left she'd well and truly be alone."I told my ward to organize this defense group; I take full responsibility," Albus pushed his chair back, rising to his feet. Dahlia's heart pounded in her chest at his words - they'd take him to Azkaban for this. All because she'd tried to interfere after being told not to. She struggled harder, screams of rage ripping from her throat."No!" Harry was struggling harder now too. "Headmaster!""Is that an admission, Albus?" Cornelius Fudge spoke for the first time. "You admit to funding and organizing a student based army?""I do," Dumbledore said calmly, meeting the Minister's gaze. Dahlia panicked now. She had too many questions, too much about her was left unknown. Albus was supposed to be helping her find answers. They still didn't know who her father was; they hadn't finished their occlumency lessons, and he still hadn't mentioned her prophecy. Desperately Dahlia fought against Nott's hold on her, thrashing her arms and kicking backwards with her legs."I'm afraid you're going to have to come with us." Fudge's voice was hard, and at his command two men stepped out from the shadows behind him. They moved towards Dumbledore, who raised his hand in silent warning."I'm afraid I won't be going anywhere with you, Cornelius," Dumbledore's voice was kind, but his eyes were frigid. His eyes swept to Dahlia, who was still struggling against Nott and Zabini. Tears filled her eyes as she fought to get to her guardian, tears streaming down her faceAlbus's eyes met hers, and for a moment Dahlia felt a brush against her mental wards. A soft touch; someone asking permission to enter. Hesitantly she lowered them, and Albus's voice filled her mind.I will be back. Continue your search, his voice murmured in her mind, though his lips did not move as his eyes bore into hers. Images floated in her head; a small cottage on the shore, surrounded by bluffs. She could smell the ocean brine, hear the crashing waves. A small house, with a garden behind it, built into the dunes. It was quaint, secluded - the perfect hideaway.A small sense of peace rushed over her as she realized what he was doing. Albus was showing her where he was going."Take me with you!" The words tumbled from her lips accidentally, tears free falling down her face as Albus turned away from her."Albus..." Fudge's voice held a warning."Cornelius," Ablus gave him a friendly nod. "Delores, always a pleasure," he tipped his pointed hat to her before winking at Dahlia. "We'll talk when I return."With that Dumbledore raised his hands above his head and clapped loudly. Faux soared across the room, grasping his hands just as they joined together, and phoenix and man disappeared together in a bright flash of fire and ash."Albus!" Dahlia felt his name rip from her throat. She jerked her arm free of Zabini's grasp and fell forward, trying to get to the spot where her guardian had last been. Harry's cries could be heard behind her as he tried to break free of the Inquisitorial Member holding him."Where has he gone?!" The aurors went mad, spinning around as though expecting the headmaster to reappear behind them.Mayhem ensued. Umbridge was screaming at the top of her lungs, while the two men with Fudge inspected the room, wands drawn as if Dumbledore would reappear at any minute. Dahlia didn't process any of it, just calmly lifted one of Fox's feathers from the pile of ash, and placed it in her pocket. Tears streamed down her face, and it wasn't until someone was jerking her arm and forcing her to walk forward that she jolted back to reality."Escort Miss Dumbledore and Mr. Potter to their dormitories!" Umbridge's shrill voice rang out. "I will administer appropriate punishments tomorrow. Cornelius..." Delores turned to the Minister, her voice lowering as they began to talk in heated hushed tones."Come on," Nott's rough voice jerked her back to reality as he pulled her from the office. Dahlia stumbled along behind him, still shaken from the past few minutes. Zabini followed them, glancing over their shoulder as members of the Inquisitorial Squad dispersed. Dahlia briefly saw Malfoy escorting Harry from the office, but couldn't be sure. They rounded the corner of the hallway before she got a second glance."I'm going to kill her," Dahlia stammered as Nott continued to jerk her down the hallway. Still in shock, she allowed him to grip her upper arm and lead her away as she stumbled over her feet trying to match his pace. "I swear I'm going for Goyle and then I'm going to turn her into a horrid pink handbag since she likes the fucking color so much and throw it into Fiendfyre!" Her anger was causing tears to stream down her face again as Nott glanced down at her."You sure you're a Gryffindor?" Zabini asked as Nott pulled her up a flight of stairs. "You're the most blood thirsty Gryffindor I've ever met."Dahlia whirled around, hand curling into a fist, "Shut it or you're next!" she snapped, stumbling when Nott's grip on her wrist tightened, causing her to lurch forward."Chill out," Zabini snapped back at her, taking a hasty step backwards, "I'm not the one that used dark magic or drove your father into hiding!""He's not my father!" Dahlia roared, ripping her wrist out of Nott's grasp. She started to take a step toward Zabini, hands clenched in fists when Nott's hands grabbed her waist and jerked her backwards. He spun her around so he was gently pinning her against the wall, her hands behind her back."Take a breath," he commanded, holding her at arm's length. "Fuck, Dahlia, please, for the love of Merlin, calm down."Dahlia sniffed, her chest shuddering as she tried to calm down. She took several deep breaths, waiting until her heart rate had slowed before opening her eyes and glaring at Nott with a look that promised revenge. "I'm going to kill her.""No one ever doubted you on that one," Nott said with a twisted grin, hesitantly releasing his hold on her. "Let's get you back to your common room.""No," Dahlia shook her head immediately, staying in place. "Not now. Not when everyone is going to be waiting.""Okay..." Zabini rubbed the back of his neck. "Where to then?""Come on," Nott tugged her up another flight of stairs and down a hallway until they reached an empty storage closet. He held the door open for her, ushering her through It was surprisingly roomy, with a few brooms and mops scattered about. The shelves on the wall were stacked with clean potions and rags, the single light on the wall casting eerie shadows."How'd you find this one?" Zabini asked, almost impressed. Dahlia gave them a disgruntled glance; did Nott specialize in broom closets?"Last semester with some Hufflepuff girl. Stumbled into it on accident," Nott explained as though that was how he discovered all his broom closets.Wordlessly, Dahlia summoned a bottle of liquor, popping the cap off and taking a generous swig. She was hesitant to sit down after hearing about Nott's extracurricular activities that led to the discovery of this broom closet. Nott and Zabini watched her silence until she offered them the bottle. "I swear I wasn't an alcoholic until this past year."Nott shrugged, "Doing better than the rest of us then." He flipped over a bucket and took a seat. Zabini glanced around, tapping a nearby bucket with his toe."This one safe to sit on, mate?" He shot Nott a knowing look. Nott didn't bother to hide the large grin that spread over his face proudly."Sit wherever - we did it standing up."Zabini snorted, but trusted his friends words as he collapsed onto the bucket. Dahlia ignored their chatter, seething quietly. Dahlia stewed over the bottle in her hands as she nursed it for a few extra seconds. "I'm going to kill that pink fucking hag.""For a man who isn't your father, you're surprisingly protective," Zabini noted, giving her a pointed look.Dahlia winced, looking down at the ground before pinning him with a glare. "Look, it's just that he's always made it apparent that I wasn't his child. That's not my choice; that's his. I'm just lucky he took me in.""That's pitiful, Dumbledore," Nott noted as he plucked the bottle from her hands, taking a generous swig.Dahlia snarled at him as she reached for it back, to no avail. "How would you feel if the man who raised you had his whole life to formally adopt you, but never did? If I was truly his daughter he would have adopted me. You heard him in there - 'my ward'. "Zabini shrugged as Nott passed him the bottle. "Yeah, I caught that."Dahlia didn't respond. She returned to her brooding thoughts, her face settling into a permanent scowl. "Who taught Goyle dark magic?" She gauged the Slytherin's reactions closely, but both remained blank."How did you know how to counter the spell?" Zabini looked at her curiously, countering her question with one of his own."I don't - I didn't," Dahlia stammered, looking away. "I felt it. I felt the magic in the air shift when he used that spell. It was like my magic reacted on it's own.""Interesting," Nott looked intrigued. He glanced at Zabini. "She really might be the most Powerful witch of our age."Dahlia snorted; those words sounded ridiculous. Just because she could do some wandless magic didn't make her powerful - being Dumbledore's ward didn't make her powerful. "If I was the most powerful witch, Umbridge would be nothing but a flaming pink handbag, and Goyle would be an ant I squashed under my foot. Albus would be sitting in the headmaster's chair, and we wouldn't be starting a bloody war.""Touche," Nott lifted his glass in the air, backing off at the warning tone in her voice."I'm sorry about earlier," Dahlia glanced sideways at Nott, remembering her moment of remorse in the headmaster's office. "I didn't know it was you behind me."Nott brushed off her apology. "Wasn't too bad, just felt like someone shoved needles into my hands for a few seconds."Dahlia smiled sheepishly. "I was talking about the head butt, but next time don't interfere when I'm threatening someone.""Don't worry, I'm sure that's the last time Goyle will ever try to use dark magic."Dahlia's face sobered up, her eyes falling to her twisted hands in her lap. They passed the bottle around in silence for a few moments before Zabini spoke."Do you know where Dumbledore went?"Dahlia glanced at him crossly, despite the cottage flashing through her mind. "Don't you think if I knew that I would have already left?"Zabini shrugged, hands lifted in defeat, "Okay, fair enough."Dahlia rolled her eyes, leaning back so that she was against the shelf, crossing her arms. "I can't wait to see the punishments she comes up with for this."Nott winced, exchanging dark looks with Zabini. "It's not good, Dumbledore," he warned. "She was talking about it a few days ago."Dahlia's face darkened, but she shrugged. "I got the younger kids out. I guess that's something.""Heard you've done your fair share with Umbridge this year anyways."Dahlia looked at Nott, slightly cross. "You were there when I threw her into a wall, weren't you? She sliced my hand open for a week because of that."Nott flinched, looking away awkwardly. "Yeah, Malfoy told us about it. We lightened up detentions after we found out.""Malfoy told you?" She cut a sharp glance at the Slytherin boys around her. She looked between them before leaning forward, suddenly suspicious. Everything came back to Malfoy - why? Suddenly she started questioning everything, especially why two Slytherins would suddenly befriend a Gryffindor. "Why'd you invite me to drink that first night?""Zabini wanted to shag you," was Nott's immediate response."Malfoy was asking questions about you," Zabini spoke at the same time as Nott. He registered his friends words a moment later, reaching over to smack the back of his head."Bloody hell, mate, is there no honor -""Malfoy asks questions about me?" Dahlia interrupted him, glad to pass over Nott's remark.Nott winced, shooting an equally cross scowl at Zabini as he answered. "His dad asks him about you, don't know why." His words were clipped as if he wasn't sure what he was allowed to say.Dahlia's face visibly paled at those words, and she was unable to contain her shock. If Lucius Malfoy knew who she was, that meant he knew she murdered Rudolphus. She swallowed nervously, willing her shaking hands to steady. What if Lucius went poking into her history? Words Malfoy had said to her a week previous flashed through her head. "What if I was protecting you? What if by writing to you it was the same as writing your obituary?" Ice cold dread slithered down her spine. Something told her there was another side to the story - something Malfoy hadn't told her."Tell Malfoy to keep my name out of his mouth." Dahlia attempted to sound unbothered, but judging by the curious looks the Slytherins were giving her she hadn't succeeded. She willed her hammering heart to slow down; there was nothing she could do about it right now except maintain her cover of innocence.Nott leaned forward, regarding her curiously. Her reaction must have given away some of her panic because both Slytherins were watching her closely. "What could Malfoy Sr. possibly want with you?"Dahlia shrugged, trying to look nonchalant as she met his curious gaze with a firm one of her own. "It could be the fact that I blew up the entire graveyard where Voldemort tried to kill Harry." Better to give them obvious answers that led to awkward conversation than true answers that would lead to her demise.Nott paled at the use of the Dark Lord's name, and Zabini physically winced. "So, it's true then? You fought him?""I never fought Voldemort. Harry did." Dahlia was growing uncomfortable with the conversation, squirming awkwardly in her seat. If this was the price she had to pay she'd pay it willingly, albeit awkwardly.Zabini let out a deep breath, reaching for the bottle in Dahlia's hand as though this conversation required a drink. "Did you really kill the death eater that murdered Diggory?"Dahlia glanced at him sharply, but allowed him to take the bottle from her. Nott smacked Zabini's shoulder indignantly. "You can't just ask her that!""I did," Dahlia said quietly, interrupting Zabini's argument with Nott. Both boys looked at her sharply, as though worried they hadn't heard her correctly."What?""Yes, I killed the death eater that murdered Cedric." Dahlia met Zabini's eyes, her eyes dark with anger and hurt, simmering with unrequited rage.Nott paled, him and Zabini exchanging skeptical looks. "You killed -""This is war," Dahlia snarled, standing to her feet. "I watched the life leave Cedric's eyes - watched his body fall to the ground. So, yes," she whirled around, hands planted firmly on her hips as she glared at Zabini. "Yes, I killed him. A life for a life.""So it's not an empty threat when you say you're going to kill Umbridge?"Dahlia smirked, a twisted smile that promised revenge a thousand times over. "It's a promise."
