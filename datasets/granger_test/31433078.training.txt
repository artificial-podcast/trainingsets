"Being a wizard is more than just using magic." Professor Lupin started looking at us without any expression. "It takes a lot of bravery and self-control to practise magic and create it, just as you all are doing."

"Is he really going to explain to us what being a wizard is?" a voice from the Slytherin group mumbled with a mocking tone, gaining a bunch of bad looks from the Gryffindors.

"That's exactly today's topic, lads. Bravery and self-control. And, can you think of a better way to find bravery and self-control than confronting your biggest fear?"

The entire room was deadly quiet.

Confronting it? Right here in front of all this....people? Not my cup of tea.

"C'mon, please. Follow me." Lupin said walking out of the room.

All the Gryffindors stood up quickly with a big smile on their faces. I looked at the rest of the people in my house and their not-wanting-to-live-anymore or I'm-too-good-to-be-here faces. Without waiting for any of them, I took my stuff and walked fast not to lose Lupin from my sight.

"Hey, Arambella." I heard one of the boys from Gryffindor calling me. "Is the bitch of your mother trying to escape from Azkaban as well? Or are the Snape genes too slow to make her even think?"

Here go again

. The Sirius Black situation. I looked at him with the biggest bitch face ever.

"Oh how fucking original. Maybe try not to repeat the same fucking joke your mates already told me twice."

As every single day since I arrived at Hogwarts, the Gryffindors decided to bother me.

"How does it feel to know you not only belong to the most hated house in all Hogwarts but you also are the niece of the most hated Professor of all time?"

I decided to ignore him when I saw Lupin was opening the staff-room door, mainly, because I didn't want to cause trouble during my favourite lesson. There wasn't anybody inside it, only an old table in front of huge windows and an old ugly grey wardrobe.

Oh shit, I knew what was coming.

A weird noise, like something punching the wardrobe's door, could be heard from the inside. The professor stood in front of it and looked at all of us with his usual kind smile. He must be one of the few Gryffindors I liked.

"Okay, does anyone know what could be inside of this?" he started, pointing at the piece of furniture.

Everyone stayed silent. We all obviously knew what was inside of it (we had to study Boggarts in the third year with the annoying professor Quirrell) but no one wanted to look like they cared that much or brag about being a know-it-all.

Lupin sighed.

"There's a Boggart in there. If I'm not wrong Professor Quirrell must have shown you what a Boggart is in what? Third Year perhaps?" we all agreed, even though everything about that year was almost unbelievable. "Okay, then you should know they like closed, dark spaces, they are shape shifters what more?... Oh yeah, they take the form of our independent biggest fear."

Some people held their breath at the last words. I don't think there is anyone in this world that would like to confront what scares them the most in front of a bunch of teenagers.

Not a good idea

My mind quickly pictured what was going to appear once my turn came and I hoped that we wouldn't have time for it since I was completely sure the Gryffindors would mock me for it for the rest of my academic life.

"If you please could form a line in front of here," Lupin said guiding one of the Gryffs.

They were all so desperate to prove how brave they were...

I rathered stay aside from the action, so I sat in one of those old tables with the autumn sun hitting my back, watching and observing closely how they made the

Riddikulus

enchantment.

"What's going on, Arambella? Too coward for a little fun?" a voice talked a couple of steps by my side.

I turned my eyes to my right and there he was,

Frederick Gideon Weasley

; tall, athletic, ginger, arrogant smile and a fucking attitude.

"What do you want, Weasley?" I said with disdain.

He crossed his arms in front of his chest, making his shirt tighter and giving him a bigger and meaner look.

Good luck to him if he thinks he's going to intimidate me.

"Nothing, just wondering how is little Snape going to pass DADA without Severus' help?"

There we go again, couldn't they go a whole day without mentioning who my uncle is?

"That's none of your business"

"Oh, careful, mate. You're picking your uncle's mood!"

Fucking Weasley, worse than a pain in the arse!

"Fuck off! Don't you have anything better to do?" I stood up approaching him. We were looking at each other straight in the eye, almost as if we were about to duel. One of us had a fucking annoying smile and the other one was about to break a ginger's face.

"I hope you are not this cowardly in the field. Quidditch can be really rough and I'm not going to hesitate to hit you with the bludger" he said calmly and with an innocent tone. "Your team should be worried nothing happens to you before the match... There are some pranksters out there who can hurt you, little Snape."

"Pack it up, Krum. You should be more worried to know how to throw the bludger before even thinking to hit me with it. And I'm not scared of pranksters."

He was about to say something else but a male's voice interrupted.

"Lilith?" Lupin said looking at me. It was my turn to be in front of the Boggart.

I sighed hardly and walked through a group of Gryffindors who had made a little circle around Weasley and me.

Bloody show-offs, they only care about being the centre of the world.

"Okay, you already know the enchantment. Stay calm, don't hesitate and remember, whatever you see it's not real, clear?" the Professor said with a lower voice while he indicated to me where and how to stand. I ignored all the little mumbles in the room, people were too busy gossiping or talking about their boggarts to bother about me and it was better like that.

"Clear"

"Great, here we go." he opened the wardrobe's door and everything went silent. A cold air ran into my spine and chills covered my body from up to down. There she was, with that dark brown hair, black eyes, big nose, and that wrecked grey dress with her skin full of scars, dust and wounds. She looked exactly how I saw her the last time two years ago.

My mother.

"Lili! My baby!" she said with a soft sharpened voice looking at me with that crazy look she had in Azkaban. Her eyes were very opened and her mouth was dry. Her skin looked very mistreated and the weight loss and the passing of time made her face more similar to her brother's.

I gave one step back.

Air, I need air...

"Remember, Lilith. Don't hesitate" Remus whispered.

"Lili, please" her voice cracked with her hand opened in my direction. "Come here, love. The Dark Lord needs us. Let me mark you" she showed her dark mark which was dirty, almost gone and looked infected because of some wound Merlin knows how she got, my stomach shrunk.

A big knot formed in my throat while I pointed at her with my wand, shaking horribly.

Riddikulus

"Come with me, daughter. Let me mark you."

RIDDIKULUS.

"HOW DARE YOU ABANDON ME?! YOU ARE JUST LIKE..."

RIDDIKULUS!

She started to choke before finishing her sentence, she took her hand to her neck, coughing and curving her body until she transformed into a big black crow.

"Well done, Lilith. 10 points for Slytherin" Lupin said giving me a comforting look. He seemed like he wanted to console me but was too afraid to even try.

If Severus had known how much I struggled to form the enchantment I would be in trouble...

"Yeah, thank you, Professor," I answered trying not to stutter or show any emotions.

I turned around and I found all eyes on me. Gryffindors looked scared, amused and some of them gave me pity looks. Slytherins were all just standing there, no emotion.

"A'ight, class is over!! Remember to practise this enchantment as much as you can! Everybody out to your next class!" Professor Lupin announced, clapping his hands to hurry us up.

I didn't look at anybody, just took my stuff and got out of there as quickly as possible hoping to catch some fresh air during my free time.

"Hey, Lilith! If Circe Snape was my mother I would be deadly scared too!" shouted an amused masculine voice.

Of course, Fred Weasley.

"Shut up, Weasley or I'll curse you," I answered without looking at him and walking through his entire crew of clowns.

She didn't finish the sentence. But I knew exactly what she was about to say.

YOU ARE JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

"Did she appear? Right there in front of you?"

I breathed the smoke from my cigarette before answering. Thanks to a little enchantment, I could smoke in the abandoned restroom at Hogwarts without anyone noticing it.

"You know it wasn't her actually, but yeah."

"And how did she look?" the girl in front of me was perplexed. Her big blue eyes shined with pure curiosity and a bit of fear.

"Just like the last time I saw her at Azkaban, Liv. And you know what's the worst part? She appeared in front of all of them. Obviously, they laughed at me." I gave the cigarette a puff.

Olivia Lovegood had a little sad expression on her face.

"I'm really sorry, Lilith. I don't understand why they treat you like that. You are nothing like your mother."

And she was right, maybe I was a Slytherin just like her, and Merlin knows how I would react if the love of my life suddenly abandoned me with a child to raise by my own, but the only thing I inherited from Circe Snape was the dark brown hair and type of body shape. My eyes, few freckles, curls, facial features and lots of aspects in my personality were my father's genes.

Not that I was proud of it either.

I smiled at her.

"How are you gonna understand those bastards if you are the kindest human being ever, Liv? You wouldn't mess with anyone even if they were pissing you off." I passed her the cigarette and she gave a puff, then she started coughing.

I wondered if she knew that smoking didn't make her look meaner, it only made her look more defenceless than usual.

"Are those stupid know-it-alls still bothering you?" I asked.

Liv was the first Lovegood to be in another house than Ravenclaw. She was a Hufflepuff, with beautiful long blond hair, big blue eyes and nose and cheeks full of freckles. Even though she was older than her sister, she had to bear with the mockery of Luna's classmates who were absolutely convinced that Liv was not half as smart as Luna. In addition to that, the fame of her family didn't help her at all.

"As long as I ignore them, they don't exist to me," she said proudly.

"You know what? Sometimes I wish I could deal with the ones who mess with me the same way you do with yours."

Liv started to laugh loudly. In some weird way, we were pretty similar. Both of us were lonely people who had to deal with others mockery just for something that was not our fault. Maybe it was what united us so much to the point to consider her my family more than the actual one, and what made us meet each other at the loneliest abandoned restrooms in all Hogwarts (where not even Moaning Myrtle came) to rant about our lives and to smoke freely.

"You couldn't do that even if you tried, Lilith. That short temper of yours is what feeds them."

"Wait for this short temper to break their faces," I replied finishing the cigarette. "Are you gonna come to watch me destroy Weasley's ass at the Quidditch match?"

"Of course! But you should go now, being Snape's niece is not going to allow you to arrive late to his class"

Even though I could think of a lot of things better to do, I had to listen to Liv. I hugged her before leaving and run all over the corridors just to be in time at the Dungeons. When I arrived, Snape wasn't there yet, instead, all the Slytherins were in front of the door, whispering between each other and giving bad looks to the Gryffindors, who as usual, were messing around.

"Slytherin is going to lose the match, you shouldn't be worried, Angelina. Especially with that weak coward Arambella."

I turned around at the mention of my last name just to find Sienna Plums, one of the most annoying Gryffindors to ever exist. She was talking to Angelina Johnson — one of the few ones from her house who minded their own business— while she had her hands around Fred Weasley's right arm.

"What did you say, Plums?" I called her without changing the low pitch of my voice and walking slowly towards her, like a snake looking at its prey.

Sienna looked at me with her almond-shaped hazel eyes. She was very pretty; olive skin, light brown straight hair, and my same height (even though she was always complaining to the boys "how short she was").

"I'm just saying that if the Dementors are gonna be out there during the match and you react as you did today with the Boggart, it's not going to be difficult to win the match," she said faking an innocent expression. "Well, it's not like it would be difficult anyway because, you know, Gryffindor has better players than Slytherin."

"Oh, really? Says who?"

"I don't know...maybe the two last cups?" she said ironically, making all her mates giggle. "Listen, Arambella, let's just say Quidditch is not your thing, okay? You would be much better practising your DADA skills...Uhm, no, no, that's not a good idea. We don't want you to end like your uncle, do we?" my eyes opened widely and suddenly all the students were looking at us. "Or what's worst...like your mother"

The fucking audacity.

She kept that innocent expression while I heard how some people around us gasped.

"Sienna!" Angelina mumbled calling her out with furrowed eyebrows.

"Say that again and I'll make you swallow your tongue," I said through clenched teeth.

It was always the same; they mention my uncle, then my mother, and when they got tired, they mentioned the two of them.

Plums left Fred's arm, who was surprisingly quiet just looking at us with an amused face and eyebrows raised, and walked towards me.

"I wonder what someone scared of her own mother can do" she mocked.

I felt my hands shaking with pure rage and I wanted to punch her or to throw her the wickedest course my mind could think of.

I knew they weren't going to let that pass. 

A deep and sharpening voice interrupted. "What is going on here?"

I looked to my left and Snape's figure was standing there with his serious unexpressive face. He was asking everybody but his black eyes were focused on me.

"Nothing, Professor," I answered lowering my head as he passed to open the Dungeons door.

"I expect so, Ms Arambella. I would not like to send my own relative to the headmaster's office".

Sighing hard, I walked in front of the group which had heaped in front of the door, observing the scene.

I took a seat at the corner in the third line, closer to the only window in the Dungeons. The class started quickly and soon we were all focusing on a practical task. I took out of my bag an old potions book my uncle gave years ago (when our relationship was still good enough to not have tension). It contained all his notes in Potions from his years as a student.

Suddenly, a boy from Third Year knocked on the door and opened it asking Snape to go to the headmaster's office since Dumbledore required his presence.

"Thank you, Finnigan, you can return to your class," he said grabbing his wand. "Arambella, make sure everybody follows the rules while I'm out."

"Snape saving you again, huh?" someone said with an ironic tone behind me once Severus left the Dungeons. I turned around and I found Fred Weasley looking at me with that same cocky and challenging smile.

"Don't need anyone to save me from you lot," I replied imitating his smile.

He snickered quietly and put his elbows on the table to approach me.

"I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you," he whispered.

"Well then, thank Merlin you are not me, you would be terribly wrong," I said looking at him directly making sure to keep strong eye contact. "I'm not scared of you."

"Mmh, you should," his voice lowered and a mischievous bright appeared in his brown, now darker than usual, eyes.

"It looks more like you are the one scared of me, Weasley," I hissed, giving him a fake and feline smile. 

He snorted, pretending to laugh; "Scared of you? You are not half meaner as you pretend you are, Arambella. The worst thing that could happen to me is getting detention with your insufferable uncle." 

"That's what you think, Weasley, but I'm not going to be the one to burst your bubble."

"Silence!" Snape's voice interrupted even though there was anybody else talking. "Let's taste your potions. If they are not well performed you will have to repeat them during the lunch break until you get the correct result. The house which makes the better potion will earn 20 points."

He rolled up his sleeves to start examinating one of the Slytherin boys' potion. Fifteen minutes later, half of the class had received a low mark and three of them were ordered to repeat their potion. When Snape approached mine and tried it, he gave one quick look to the book by my side and a little bright of pride shined in his black eyes without changing his bitter face expression.

"20 points for Slytherin" he informed, making a hand gesture that indicated the class was finished.

I looked all over the room just to find some accomplice eyes and another bunch of judging ones which expressed some of the biggest disdain I've been looked with.

If they only knew how hard was for me to gain Snape's approval being my father's daughter...

The corridor was full of students, apparently, we were all in our free hour before the next class.I saw a familiar blond head and walked straight to it."Oi, Malfoy!" I called Draco's attention. He was talking with his friends Crabbe and Goyle, who, when they saw me, walked away. Draco looked at me with a kind smile."Hello, Lilith. Ready for tomorrow's match? Everybody is talking about it," he said leaning against the wall."Yeah, I already had a few chats about it," I remembered today's encounter with Plums and Weasley claiming how hard he would hit me with the bludger."You know you are the best Beater in all Hogwarts. Besides, we already won Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, and that stupid Potter is very weak because of the Dementor's presence.""Heard so, didn't he fall from the sky during the match against Hufflepuff?""Yeah, what a fucking idiot!" he laughed.At that exact moment, the mentioned Potter appeared in the corridor, as always he was surrounded by his two friends, Granger and little Weasley."Malfoy's a good seeker, it pains me to say it, but he is. Harry, we have to find you a good broom or we are gonna lose against those twits," said little Weasley (I think his name was Ron or something like that)."If I were you I wouldn't worry too much, Potter. You are going to lose anyway!" shouted Draco, making the three of them turn around and look at us. Even though it was Weasley the one who talked, Draco went straight to attack Harry. Typical.I gave Draco a severe look. I never understood why he liked to mess with them that much."Shut up, Malfoy," Potter hissed giving him a serious stare. "The Dementors are no going to be there, and I won't hesitate during the match. Not even all your father's money would make you win."Draco changed his expression. I knew that his relationship with his father was kinda complicated. Maybe that's why I always felt like we could be friends."Hey, calm down, mate. We already know you are the Great Potter." I intervened before Draco could say anything. "The Slytherin Team has more than Draco and his money, you know? Some of us don't need daddy's reputation to make us a good Quidditch player."Harry's green eyes were full of surprise, he wasn't expecting me to reply to him. He probably knew I was Snape's niece and, unlike the Gryffindors of my course, most of the students didn't even approach me fearing my uncle's reaction."Careful, Harry. She is Lilith Arambella, Beater of Slytherin and Snape's niece." Hermione whispered to Potter and Weasley.Ronald glared at me up and down with quite an annoyance."Wow, I was about to introduce myself but I see I'm so famous I don't even need to," I answered ironically crossing my arms in front of my chest. "Didn't know you were so interested in me, Granger. Maybe next time ask me directly for a date so you can learn more facts."She gasped and was about to reply with what I'm sure would have been something witty, but someone appeared before she talked."Defending Malfoy, huh? Didn't know you like them younger, Lilith." Fred interrupted, trying to sound funny while the three kids looked at him as he was some sort of genius hero. He was really far away from that. "C'mon Ron, let's leave the two lovers alone.""You can go fuck yourself, Weasley!" I shouted while he was walking away followed by the golden trio."I would tell you the same, Arambella, but Malfoy's already doing that!"

UGH, THE WAY I HATE THIS MAN!

I turned around and I found Draco looking at them with a furrowed eyebrow."Do they actually think we are together?" he asked shocked."Oh, of course not, Draco! Don't you see he's so childish and scared about me beating his ass at the field that he has to play the "lover" card to try to embarrass me?" I picked my bag and started walking. "Let's go to the common room. I can't stand coming across those idiots anymore. I had enough Gryffindors for today."An hour later, I was relaxing at the almost empty Slytherin common room, by the fireplace, looking through the window at the depths of the lake.Draco was talking to some girl from his course about some technique he had prepared for the match and the rest of the students in there, five or six people were focused on their homework. That was something I really enjoyed about being a Slytherin, everybody minded their own business."Lilith? 'Re you okay?" a soft voice called me. Liv was in front of me with those shiny and gentle eyes.She had the entrance to our common room allowed since I directly begged Snape for her to be here. When she entered with me, no one said a word and just ignored the fact that she's a Hufflepuff, but the first time she entered by herself, Marcus complained and almost pushed her out of the common room while he called her "the badgers' bitch" so I disarranged his jaw in a punch and he never complained about Liv's presence again."Yes, Liv. Everything's fine. How was your day?"She sat with me looking through the window with a sad face."As always, nothing new."I knew exactly why she looked so sad but I decided not to say anything about it and just let her have a nice moment."Fancy some hot chocolate while we read that Muggle novel you like?"A big smile appeared on her face and she started agreeing with her head looking like a happy puppy.I couldn't help but smile. In all of this fucking shit of school, Olivia was not only the shine of light that made it less hard to stand but also the only person who never judged me and with whom I could really be myself. Without her, Merlin knows what kind of depression I'd be immersed in.

( . . . )

Today.Finally, today was the Quidditch match against Gryffindor. All the Slytherin players woke up earlier than the rest of the house, Marcus wanted us to have the last training before confronting the lions. I was practising with a fake bludger against one of the walls on how to focus my strength in the hit when a bunch of loud voices made their entrance.

There they were.

The Weasley twins were leading the group, messing around and joking, followed by a smiley Lee Jordan, a shy and concentrated Oliver Wood, Johnson and Bell talking with each other and a distracted Potter, whose eyes were focused on the sky as if he was looking for something or someone.They gave us a quick disdained gaze and started practising in their side of the field. Lee ran to the tower of control since he had to prepare the microphone before starting the match.George was giving Harry some advice, probably something about how to avoid the bludgers since he was a Beater as well, but his brother, ugh.....Fred was giving me his characteristic cocky challenging smile while he was doing some stretches. If he was trying to intimidate me, he was failing catastrophically.Soon, all the sits started to be full of students and professors, and in the main seat with the best position to watch the match was Dumbledore, giving a proud look to the Gryffindor team.Once we all were out of the changing rooms, it seemed like everybody in the entire school was ready to watch the match. I looked to the Slytherin seats, everyone was hyping us and shouting happily, I think I've never seen our people look so excited. A little yellow scarf stood out between the green ones; Olivia. I smiled and waved at her. She wasn't singing and shouting like the others but the simple fact of her supporting me was enough.The rest of the houses were hyping Gryffindor, of course.Madam Hooch came with the box where the balls were kept and repeated the rules for us. We all positioned in front of one from the contrary team and what a fuckingcoincidence I ended up being in front of Fred.He was smiling, nothing new, but his eyes slightly shocked me. Those brown eyes shined with fierce like a lion ready to eat its prey.Hooch blew her whistle.Let the game begin.

The exact moment the whistle sounded, I started flying trying to catch one of the bludgers. I gave a quick gaze and Potter was looking for the snitch with Draco behind him. Warrington, from my team, took the Quaffle from Spinet, taking it to Wood's zone. I saw George Weasley pointing the other bludger to Warrington.

Fuck no.

I took mine and reunited almost all my strength to throw it through the entire field but the exact second I had calculated my position to hit him, I was pushed and the bludger's path changed so it didn't hit George, only grazed his left arm.

Shit.

I looked to my right and found Fred, he was the one who pushed me. I kept flying as fast as I could to catch any from the bludgers. Spinet caught the Quaffle again and scored. Fuck, we were losing ten to zero.I saw Flint about to throw Angelina Johnson off her broom."Marcus, if you dare to make us lose points because you're not able to play fair I'm gonna throw you out of the fucking window, you son of a bitch!" I shouted as I threw the bludger to one of the Gryffindor players who were about to catch the Quaffle to help Angelina. He didn't catch it thanks to me. Instead, one of my team caught it and flew all over the field. I saw Fred going after him with his bludger ready so I approached and threw him mine. He nearly fell off his broom and shockingly glared at me."Sorry, mate. Didn't mean to hit you. Better stay out of the way!" I said ironically.He looked at me with pure anger and rage.Slytherin scored. Then Wood stopped another hit and they scored again. I was trying to remain calm as I kept hitting the Gryffindor players until I noticed a broom too close to mine. I looked behind me and there was Fred.I groaned as I tried to make my broom go faster, but he was pretty fast as well so we were involved in a very equal race. I looked for the other Slytherin Beater but he was too busy trying to hit Bell so she couldn't reach the Quaffle and Slytherin scored again. At the other side of the field, Draco and Potter were still trying to find the bloody snitch.One Bludger flew to me, and I quickly caught it in the air. Fred made a noise behind me, complaining since it was George who threw it trying to give it to his brother.I looked above me and saw Johnson with the Quaffle in her hands. I had the perfect shot, I lifted the Bludger and hit it with all the strength of my body, it hit her in her arm making her lose the Quaffle. I high-fived Draco who just passed by my side, congratulating me silently for that hit. Then, the other Bludger hit me. Fucking Weasley, again.I caught it and tried to throw it again but this time I failed because someone literally threw me off my broom. Fred looked at me with a big revengeful smile but in a millisecond I grabbed his cape and took him to the floor with me. Luckily, we were pretty close to the floor but we fell so hard that our wands flew out of our pockets...I stood up as soon as my body reached the floor and so did he. Our eyes came across, full of fury, and we walked straight to each other."What the fuck do you think you are doing, Arambella?!" he shouted, remaining only a few centimetres away from me."No, what are YOU doing?! Are you fucking nuts?!" I confronted standing even closer than before. Did he want to play the intimidation game? Fine, let's play."I should've known a bloody snake can't play fairly!" he said lowering his tone, sounding more threatening."Me?! What about you, bastard?! You made me fall off my broom! You could have killed me, you bloody wanker!" I pushed him away from me and he clicked his tongue, looking really pissed off.He walked again to me and grabbed my arm, putting me even closer to him."Touch me again and I promise you will regret it," he growled with a deep voice guiding his eyes from mine to my mouth.My legs were shaking with pure anger and I was so pissed off I couldn't even speak.Suddenly, Hooch's whistle interrupted."Weasley! Arambella! What are you doing? To your brooms, NOW!" she shouted while keeping her eyes on the match."But, Mad-""THE BROOM, NOW!"I bit my tongue and pushed Weasley with my shoulder to pick the wand from the floor and get to my broom. Without any other word, I got on it and started flying again.Not even fifteen minutes passed when Potter finally caught the snitch.

Bloody hell! Can anything go worst today?

I flew to the floor, angry, trying not to listen to Gryffindor's screams of joy and their proud arrogant looks over us.I walked to the changing room without speaking to anyone and got out of the field.I definitely wasn't going to stay there looking at how those fucking bastards were celebrating their triumph. Damn you, Weasley. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't have lost time and let Potter catch that bloody golden ball. The child was a good seeker, one of the best ones I had ever seen, and Draco was good but chasing Potter was not the best strategy to find the snitch.Now, I would have to deal with their mockery, as if it wasn't already bad enough. Now that they won the match they would consider themselves the fucking kings of this school.My arm started to hurt and when I pulled up my sleeve I saw a big wound in it. I must have gotten it when I fell and because of the adrenaline, I didn't feel the pain before. I grabbed my wand to apply one of the healing spells but something in it felt weird. The colour was the same, the shape and the length as well...oh, no. The silver part at the bottom of my wand was missing...that wasn't my wand.But I knew exactly who was the one who had mine.

Fucking idiot.

With a heavy heart, I walked back to the field. The students were already leaving while they kept talking about the match. Most of them didn't even notice me but some of them recognise me and gave me pity laughs. I ignored them and went straight to the little group the Gryffindor team formed at the entrance ready to leave, but one of them was missing."Oi, Weasley! Where's your brother?" I called George, ignoring the rest of the team whose eyes were focused on me as well.He gave an inexpensive look."At the changing room, why?""I need something from him" I replied before walking away from them to the Gryffindor changing room.I entered without even think it twice and found an image that, deep in my mind, I knew I wouldn't be able to erase from my memory.He was there. Apparently, he just came out of the shower because his ginger hair was completely wet, the room felt hot and he was wearing only a towel around his hips.

Bloody hell...

His pale skin was covered in little drops of water, freckles and moles, and because of the dim light, it looked kinda golden. Quidditch made a great job on his body since he was tall, slender and had quite defined muscles that, far from looking too excessive, it made him look like an Adonis. The white towel, pretty short in my opinion, was hanging shamelessly of his hips and, for a moment, I was afraid that it might fall and show him just as his mother brought him to the world.

If there was a God, it really took its time on making him.

I had to force myself to take my eyes from his body and to look at his face. At first, he didn't have any expression but once he recognised me, his eyes got even darker and fierce."What are you doing here?" he said without looking at me, while he put his dirty clothes in his bag. His voice sounded very monotonous compared to the previous emotions in his eyes."My wand." I finally said, making sure not to stutter or down my eyes from his.He looked at me with furrowed eyebrows. I rolled my eyes and showed him his wand."When you threw me off my broom and fell on the floor, I took yours by mistake." I passed him the wand.He grabbed it glaring at me, confused. He examined it and looked at me with judging eyes."What did you do to it? Did you hexed it?!" he said furiously."Yeah, Weasley, I don't have anything better to do than curse your fucking wand, genius.""I don't know, maybe you wanted to play the revenge card since you lost so shamefully," he replied staring straight at me, crossing his arms in front of his chest.I gave him a disgusted look."Sorry, mate, but I'm not as childish as you. Just play fair next time and I'll show you who the actual loser is." I said arrogantly.He laughed ironically while he walked towards me.

What the fuck is he doing?

"Mate, you do have a degradation kink, don't you? What makes you think you would win me?" he said making his voice deep.I hid a gasp."I don't think anything, I just know that in a fair game I would literally end you."He didn't say a word, just continued walking towards me until he had me almost against the wall."We will see that, Lilith," he answered pronouncing my name in a way that I don't know why sounded so sinful and tempting to me.I didn't say anything back but he turned around and looked for something in his bag. Seconds later, he took my wand out of it and before allowing him to hand it to me himself, I took it from his hands."Alright, you've got your wand. Now, leave, Arambella. I need to get dressed, so you get out or this will get very uncomfortable for the both of us." he started slowing his voice while taking his hands to the towel insinuating to take it off."Don't you dare!" I stopped him. He laughed cocky."Then, leave!"I didn't wait anymore and just turned around and left him there. My mind was completely blank as I walked back to the Slytherin common room. Only once I got there, I was aware of the odd situation I lived.

What the fuck happened there?!

After the Quidditch final, the worst exams were here — the OWLS.I literally forgot about everything else in the world and just focused on them, especially those subjects that could require the highest marks in some professions. I put most of my attention in DADA, Charms and Transformations. Herbology, however... let's say that wasn't my strength in magic, I only expected an A.I locked myself in the Slytherin common room and only left it to grab a coffee at the Hall.During a whole week, I didn't know anything from the Gryffindors and even Liv was having a rest between all this mess since the Ravenclaws were too focused on being the ones with the best marks to even bother her.The previous hour to my Potions exam, I decided to leave my dorm and go to the Library since the First Year students were making a lot of noise outside of my door. When I arrived, it was almost full but at the same time, deadly quiet. I saw a group of Hufflepuffs almost crying while they were reading their books, a bunch of Slytherins quietly writing, and a group of Gryffindors who, surprisingly, were also calmed and silent.In one of the tables, all by herself, was Granger, Potter's muggle-born friend. She noticed my eyes on her and when she looked at me, she blushed horribly. Poor kid! I smirked and winked at her and she focused again on her book with her eyes open widely and her cheeks redder than ever.I sat far enough from the Gryffindor table, close to the section full of Potions books even though I was studying from my uncle's one.Someone touched my shoulder and I immediately turned around. Snape was looking at me with his usual serious face but his eyes were shining with pure concern and surprise."May I have a word with you, Arambella?" he drawled calmly and in a soft voice trying not to catch anyone else's attention, but it didn't work since in less than one second all eyes were on us."Sure, Professor."I put my bag on my shoulder and followed him to the empty corridor. While I stood in front of him, he sighed heavily as if he was debating with himself whether to talk or not."Because of the relationship that connects us, I wanted to be the one who gave you this news before any of your classmates could say anything." he started without looking directly at my face.Confused, I got closer to him and crossed my arms in front of my chest."Your mother tried to escape from Azkaban."Oh no.My legs started to shake and I felt like my mouth get drier and how my soul almost left my body. That was, by far, the worst news anybody could give me. Snape grabbed my arm to make sure I didn't fall or faint."What? Did she—? Is she—?" I couldn't even find the exact words and my voice felt far away, like if it wasn't me the one who spoke."No, no. The Dementors caught her before she could abandon the prison, but she did break her cell's door," he answered cautiously. He seemed very angry and disappointed at the same time, but for the first time in years, it seemed like those feelings weren't directed to me."What are they going to do with her?"I could barely breathe, the air was leaving my lungs as fast as it got in them.Snape sighed."She is will be taken to the most dangerous criminals' zone in Azkaban. With Lestrange, Rockwood and other main followers of You-know-who." Snape's eyes finally found mine. "She was not successful this time, Lilith, but don't think that will stop her from trying again. If I were you, I would be extremely careful out of Hogwarts..."I chuckled ironically, normalizing my heartbeat again."And inside Hogwarts too, Severus. It's not like Dumbledore would protect me or something like that. I'm not Potter nor a Gryffindor."He tightened his lips."Anyway, be careful. The other students will be announced soon about this since one of The Prophet's journalist was directly informed from the prison. Try to avoid them."If my soul didn't leave my body before, now it certainly did.

How I was going to deal with them?

Nah, fuck 'em. I had things more important to care about than those idiots' words.

I controlled my breath and ignored the cold that was invading my body.Without any other word, I walked from there and went straight to the class where the Potions OWL was going to take place. I sat almost at the back, in one of the corners. There were already some other students I identified as four Ravenclaws and three Hufflepuffs. Olivia was not there yet.I put all my efforts to keep my thoughts about my mother away, trying to quote all the side notes Snape took in his book. But it was almost impossible to concentrate on how to prepare a bloody healing potion when my mother had tried to escape from prison.

"MY BABY! I PROMISE YOU MY LOYALTY BY GIVING YOU MY BABY, DARK LORD. "

No. Not now.

"YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FROM ME, LILITH! I WON'T LET YOU ABANDON ME AS YOUR FATHER DID! THE DARK LORD WILL COME BACK AND HE WILL NEED YOU."

Please, go away.

"You are meant to be the best Death Eater, Lili. And once you become one, we are gonna take revenge over those mudbloods like your father. He will pay for leaving us, my baby. You will make him pay."

My sight went blurry and I felt quite dizzy. I had to remind myself those memories were just that, memories. She couldn't hurt me anymore. She was not there."I can't believe you are sat here, Arambella! You already know Uncle Snape has an Outstanding ready for you."Sienna Plums appeared in front of me looking challenging."Shut up, Plums. The last thing I want right now is to deal with you.""You are just being a show-off!"

What kind of drugs was this woman taking, for fuck's sake?!

I can't let this bitch annoy me more.

I looked at her straight in the eye and, with my wand below my desk, cast a simple silence spell. Her eyes opened widely as she took her hands to her throat but only a cough-like sound came."What's wrong, Plums? Is your throat too dry because you can't keep your bitchy tongue inside of your mouth? Oops," I mumbled making a fake pout.At that exact moment, Snape entered the room ordering everyone to take a sit so we could start the exam. The last students who were outside, entered the room too, trying to catch any of the places left. Olivia walked in and sat two seats behind me, she looked at me with that usual big smile of hers that staggered once she looked at my eyes. She mouthed "What's wrong?" and I made a gesture to let her know I would tell her later.Plums stopped coughing and recovered her voice since I didn't want her to get me in trouble. She gave a last bad look and walked to the other side of the room.The exam started and it made me focus on something else than my mother, which I deeply thanked. After a long hour, I stood up and walked all over the small corridor the desks formed towards Snape's place which was in front of ours, controlling everything. More than one sight was over me as I approached him, even Snape himself lifted his eyes from the tests he was correcting to look at me, surprised."Can I leave now?" I said as I put the exam over the table, making sure all the Gryffindors were seeing my bold smile.Snape looked at me with narrow eyes and picked up the test to give a quick gaze at it. His expression relaxed and when he got his eyes back on mine, a slightly proud look appeared."Sure, Ms Arambella."I didn't wait any longer to leave that room. I went to the Hall, hoping I could eat something for the first time in the entire day but I couldn't bring any bite to my mouth even if I tried, so I stayed with a big black coffee with a lot of sugar.Minutes later, other students who took the Potions OWL as well started to arrive, apparently, talking about their answers in the test. I didn't pay attention, though, since mine was very different from theirs thanks to Snape's notes."ARAMBELLA! IS IT TRUE THAT THE BITCH OF MOTHER REALLY TRIED TO ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN AND FAILED?!" one of the boys from Gryffindor shouted.

This couldn't be real.

Some loud laughs were heard in the Hall as other ones tried to hide them.The immense desire to cast one of the unforgivable curses hit the deepest part of my guts.

Merlin, if I only could...

"SHE MUST BE REALLY DENSE, THOUGH! EVEN THE MAD MAN OF SIRIUS BLACK MADE IT OUT OF THAT PIGSTY!"I stood up and pointed my wand at him. He looked surprised and almost scared. Definitely, he was not expecting my response."Silencio!"As soon as he lost his voice with the bastards of his friends concerned about him, I left the Hall and went back to the Slytherin common room, the only place where people seemed to leave me alone. I spent the rest of the evening sleeping until a little touch in my arm woke me up. Olivia was in front of me with a kind look. I knew she was feeling pity because of me but I hated when people felt like that, so she tried to hide it."Well now, tell me what happened?"

( · · · )

The rest of the night went by with me crying on Olivia's shoulder and she suggested sleeping with me so I wouldn't get the nightmares I had every time I got news from my mother. But even though I didn't get the nightmares; it wasn't because of Liv's presence, but because I couldn't close my eyes even once. Every time I tried not to think about it, a memory of me visiting her in Azkaban or the last moment I saw my father popped in my mind.That morning I couldn't concentrate during breakfast (where I only had a cup of tea) nor in the classes. McGonagall gave some weird looks during her class but I ignored her, I didn't want to give anyone any kind of explanation.By lunchtime, I grabbed another cup of tea and ordered the books in my bag."Arambella!" I heard someone shout at me from one of the Gryffindor tables. I gave a lazy look and there were almost all of them, including the Weasleys, Potter, Granger...

Not today, please.

"Next time your hippogriff tries to attack you maybe you should take a step back. We will certainly be happy with one Slytherin less in here but that's not the way! I know having Snape's genes doesn't make you really smart, but come on lass!" said a blonde boy a course older than me.They were referring to our previous class with professor Hagrid, where I was so dispersed the hippogriff tried to attack me and the professor had to stop the class to calm the animal down. I was too tired and sleep-deprived to even bother to answer him so I just simply shook my head to show my disapproval.I walked all over the corridor, trying to get to the non-used restroom where I could have a cigarette and calm myself. I slowed to search my lighter and the pack, and when I was about to open the door with a spell, I remembered Liv asked me to search her after Transfigurations. I turned around and gave two steps when suddenly, a strong arm surrounded my waist firmly to take me to the restroom. I was so shocked I couldn't talk or shout to get rid of my kidnapper. The person behind me turned me around to face them and pinned me against the door so I could not leave."What are you doing?" I whispered slowly and shocked once I recognized Fred Weasley in front of me.The light coming from the windows was hitting his back, letting his face under the shadow making his brown eyes, which were scrutinising me, almost black. His body was like ten centimetres away from me. As he analysed me, his left arm was leaned against the wall to close any kind of escape I could have."What the fuck is going on with you Lilith?"

His eyes were almost piercing me. When he noticed I didn't answer, he reincorporated himself crossing his arms in front of his chest but keeping the same little distance between us."What do you want, Weasley?" I finally said, complaining. I really did not want to deal with him at that moment."What is going on with you?" he asked coldly."What are you talking about? I-""Don't even try to tell me nothing's happening, Arambella." Fred interrupted me. "You've been quiet all day, you were looking down the WHOLE time, I don't know what Wood's friend told you but whatever it was I'm sure it wasn't a compliment, and you did not talk back to him...You really want to pretend nothing is happening?""Excuse me? That's exactly what I'm telling you and I don't need to pretend anything, Weasley, because NOTHING is happening. And even if it was, it would be none of your business" I answered with bitterness."Bullshit." he spat approaching more to me. "Don't try to act innocent with me, Lilith, both of us know you are not exactly the 'good girl' type. Now, tell me what the fuck you are plotting?"I looked at him with a mix of confusion, tedium and anger.Suddenly, all the emotions I had been hiding the entire day burnt me deeply in my guts and all the sadness became a pure rage.I grabbed him by his shirt and turned our positions so now it was him the one who was pinned against the wall. Looking at his shocked eyes, faster than ever I took my wand out of my pocket and pressed it against his neck."Listen, Weasley, and listen carefully because I won't tell you twice." I started to mumble in a low and cold voice, putting more press into his neck without changing the inexpression in my face. "I'm not Gryffindor's entertainment, and I ain't plotting shit, if I've been quiet today is because I don't want you to provoke me and end up being charged with murder, are we clear?"His expression went from pure confusion and shock to a devilish smirk."Clear," he said ironically. "Hands off me, now"Instead of obeying him, I put my wand right below his chin."Don't play with me, Weasley. I'm not in the fucking mood."His smile became bigger."What are you gonna do, huh? Curse me? Do better."I let out a big sigh of anger."You're so fucking exhausting!" I shouted, standing away from him and picking my bag to leave the restroom."It's good to have you back, Arambella!" I heard him laugh in the distance once I was already out of the place, walking through the corridor.

UGH, DAMN BASTARD.

( . . . )The school year was almost over. We had received our marks in the OWLs two days ago. I got Outstanding in Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfigurations and Charms, and Exceeds the Expectations in History of Magic, Astronomy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination and, surprisingly, Herbology.Liv and I compared our marks and we both were happy with them since her exams were full of Outstandings and Exceed the Expectations as well. We were so happy that not even Gryffindor winning the Cup of Houses again and Ravenclaw's boastfulness could tear our happiness apart.On the last day of class, I was sitting at Snape's office."What are your plans for these vacations, Lilith?" Severus asked while standing up, looking at his shelf full of elements he used in Potions.I sighed hardly. Being in Hogwarts wasn't easy at all, but definitely, most of the times Summer wasn't any better."As every year, I'm going home"The word 'home' felt weird in my mouth. That place where I lived when my family was still a family, now was only a blurred memory of where a cosy place used to stand. The Arambella House was full of old and useless rooms, with my mother's pictures all around since she burnt and ripped all my dad's ones when he left. After she was imprisoned, it became an almost abandoned and sad place where Snape left me under the protection of our house elves until he came to visit me twice a month. The house was full of memories that most of the time I didn't remember or that were too painful to even try to imagine, but it was the only place where I had to go.Severus sighed back."I know it is hard for you to go back to that house, but since Dumbledore has forbidden the stay of students in Hogwarts during Summer, I can't do anything to help you... other than offer you my house at Spinner's End."

Come again?

"Are you serious?" I asked him, surprised.This was the first time he offered to let me stay at his house. Normally, he would ask me that exact question and just nod with his head once I gave him the same answer every year."Of course. I will not be able to spend too much time there since Professor Dumbledore needs my presence here.""Can I take the elves with me? There are only three of them and they all are free but seem to still be really attached to the Arambella family and I have spent all my Summers under their care."He furrowed his eyebrow."As long as you don't destroy my house, you can take them.""Thanks...Severus." I was about to call him 'uncle' but I didn't do that since I was seven when our relationship was still fine."Yeah, er, you might want to know the two news," he said taking a seat in front of me. " The first one is that Sirius Black's trail is lost and Peter Pettigrew is alive.""I'm sorry, what?!""Apparently, the criminal could not stay away from his godson and Potter, just like his father, could not stay away from problems so they found the way to each other and found out that Ronald Weasley's disgusting pet was, in fact, Peter Pettigrew hiding from both Black and justice."Snape did not seem very happy about that news, as far as I knew Black and him were not exactly the best friends during their time in Hogwarts."That makes Sirius Black innocent, doesn't it?""It does," he answered with bitterness."So why did he escape then?""Because Peter Pettigrew escaped before him and left Black with no proof to demonstrate his innocence, and at this point, everyone knew he was close to Hogwarts so someone called the Dementors and they were ready to give him the kiss."I was shocked. Who would guess that He-who-must-not-be-named's main vassal was in fact an innocent man? 12 years in Azkaban paying for a crime that he didn't commit. Chills covered my spine and cold air ran all over my body."What's the other news?" I asked trying to avoid the Azkaban topic. It wasn't something I fancied to talk about."Professor Lupin will not continue teaching at this school next year," he said while reading what seemed to be the newspaper as if he couldn't care less about what he was saying.A sad feeling formed in my guts, I really appreciated Professor Lupin, he was one of the few Gryffindors who didn't treat me as if I was a criminal or if my entire personality was only being Snape's niece. He was a good person, or at least, he really knew how to pretend to be one."That's really sad, why is he leaving?""Some students' parents complained about his condition of werewolf and he presented his resignation."I did know Professor Lupin was a werewolf since Snape told me weeks ago but I didn't know it was such a big deal to the point of not accepting him, he was the best teacher in all Hogwarts by far."Severus, I need to go," I said grabbing my bag. In an hour we all would be out of this place and I wanted to spend a little time with Liv, and maybe Draco too, before that.He didn't answer back and I did not wait for him to do so.I walked through the corridor wanting to get to the Hall when a thought came to my mind. I changed my direction to the professors' office again but this time, standing out of a new one, not completely sure about what I was going to do.I knocked on the door twice and opened it when I heard a 'come in'. Still hesitant, I saw Professor Lupin talking with a gentle smile to Potter, who turned around when he heard the noise the door made. He looked at me with confusion and a bit of rejection. I swallowed hard. Maybe this wasn't a good idea after all."Professor, I should go," Harry murmured, grabbing a piece of paper tightly between his hands and starting to pick his stuff."Ms Arambella, come in, please. Do you need anything?" Lupin asked kindly as Harry left the room giving me a last confused look. I was frozen at the door."Uhm, yes, professor. I just have known you're not going to be here next year and I wanted to say goodbye to you since you were such a good teacher and so kind to me." I dared to say, not very sure about how he would react.Please, be kind. Please, be kind. Please, be kind.He smiled."Thank you for being such a keen student. I heard you got an Outstanding in DADA, congratulations! You've got a lot of potentials to become a great professional, Lilith. Who knows? Have you thought about becoming an Auror?"I stared at him, perplexed. An Auror? Is he serious? He was smiling but his eyes looked serious as if he really meant what he was saying."I don't know, Professor. My family..."He didn't let me finish."Family doesn't define us, Lilith. Our decisions do. It doesn't matter if you are a Snape, a Potter or even Voldemort's daughter. You make your own path.""A Slytherin becoming an Auror?" I said ironically but trying to sound kind too."Well, life is full of surprises. Not all Slytherins can be bad, can they?""No, we can't" I smiled. " Thank you, Professor. Really.""It's okay. Just remember what I told you, you make your own path and don't hesitate. Never."I thanked him again and a minute later I abandoned his office.This time I did went to the Hall, where we all had lunch for the last time this year. I was sitting in front of Draco, who was talking about something Potter told him, but I couldn't pay all my attention to him since Weasley was at the Gryffindor table with his eyes on me. He was listening to something Lee was telling him while they both looked at me. I narrowed my eyes as I saw Lee mouthing 'Circe' 'trying' 'Azkaban'.

I knew exactly what they were talking about.

Weasley smirked with his typical cocky look. Apparently, he was silently bragging about knowing why I kept so quiet the previous days. As if the entire school didn't know already.I rolled my eyes and focused my attention on Draco who was still complaining about Potter.An hour later we were all with our luggage, ready to leave. Friends were meeting each other in little groups for the last time in days, maybe weeks or even months. I was waiting, leaning on a tree, for Olivia to talk to her before she leaves and for Snape to come and drive me to the Arambella House so I could take my belongings and the elves to Spinner's End. Since Severus was going to be out most of the time, I would try to convince Liv's father to let her visit me any day of the Summer, but it was quite improbable since the Lovegoods used to spent their vacations as weirdly as they spent the rest of their time."Oi, Arambella!" I heard a familiar voice shout at me. "Aren't you gonna say goodbye to us?"Fred really enjoyed messing with me even on the last day of school.I didn't say a word, just lifted my two middle fingers along with a fake smile in his direction."Uhh, how gentle!" he laughed ironically, followed by his mates who seemed to find Fred the funniest person in the world. "I'll miss you too, girl. But don't worry, next year will be more and better!"He left the place with his brothers and sister, ready to take the Express. Once I saw the train leave, I sighed with pure relief.Finally, I could have some rest.

That Summer was one of the weirdest ones I ever lived. Even though I received Liv's visits at least twice every two weeks and that I was as alone as in the Arambella House, the memories from that place didn't attack me at Spinner's End and my own thoughts kept me busy enough to let them invade me.I hadn't received any news from my mother since before Summer, and obviously, I didn't get any news from anyone from a school other than Draco who, as usual, was trying to please the narcissistic bitch he had as a father.But lots of things were diving into my mind. One of them was this extremely weird situation we lived at the Quidditch World Cup. At first, Snape didn't want me to go with Olivia, Luna and their father but then, Draco invited me as well and my uncle allowed me to go after I insisted but only if I stayed close enough to the Lovegoods and not to the Malfoys. I went there and made sure to buy Olivia's ticket and my own since Mr Lovegood was buying his own, Luna's one and the tent where we were staying. The match was awesome and all of us enjoyed it and shouted of pure joy when Ireland won. Krum was a good seeker but he was very far away from Ireland's quality of players. Not everything was about the Seeker, do you hear that, Gryffindor team?The problem came later. When we all were celebrating Ireland's victory, they attacked. All dressed in black with their masks on so no one could recognise them, throwing curses and hexes and destroying everything after them, as they always do; Death Eaters.Xenophillus Lovegood made sure to keep us protected and to take us home safe, but before we arrived at Liv's home in the middle of rural Ireland, I heard it and the chills covered my body as well as cold sweat. That bloody curse was the last words I remembered from my mother as a free woman: Morsmordre.When I arrived back home, Snape was there. He looked at me with surprise and almost relief as if he already knew what happened at the Quidditch match. Since his expression transmitted more coldness and bitterness than ever, I decided not to ask and just wait for the three days left I had at Spinner's End before coming back to Hogwarts.Once again at the Express, I was completely alone. I pictured Draco a few steps behind me and I waited for him to arrive with this girl from his course, Pansy Parkinson."Hey, Lilith!" he waved at me and I smiled at him back.I smiled at her as well as she waved kindly at me but still being a bit shy."How's been your Summer?" I asked him, walking through the corridor of the train trying to find a locker with no people in it."It was good, everything normal until the Quidditch World Cup. I couldn't stay after Ireland won but my father told me someone attacked the celebration."I wanted to say something about it but knowing who Lucius Malfoy was I opted to stay silent. The whole journey passed quickly as we kept talking about other things and Pansy talked a bit more about herself and her Summer.Once we arrived at Hogwarts, the First Year students were welcomed by Hagrid, who left us, students from superior years, alone for a couple of minutes. Not a good idea, though."Arambella!" I heard someone chanting my name funnily.

Shit, here we go again.

"Weasley" I sighed monotonously looking straight to the front and ignoring him by my side."You missed me?" he joked bending a little bit in my direction since now, he was taller than before."No.""Oh, c'mon! Bet you did. Your Summer must have been so boring without us making fun of you to please your degradation kink.""Fuck off, you twit!" I slightly pushed him to put more distance between us at the same time his friends were laughing with Fred's childish humour."Nah, you know what? I think now we're more mature" he started making his voice deeper and emphasising the word 'mature'. "You'll have someone to please that kink and make you a bit less bitchy. Who knows? Malfoy, perhaps?""Well, at least I won't need wanks. Can't say the same, can you, Freddie?" I replied, attacking directly his masculine ego.Instead of feeling offended, as a lot of misogynistic kids at his age would do, he started laughing. I looked at him for the first time and he and his physical appearance shocked me even more than his reaction to my response.He was definitely taller than before, with his shoulders looking wider, his jaw being more defined and his ginger hair, longer.

Wow, he was looking good, the bloody bastard...

We didn't share any other word since some professors came and guided us to the Hall where Dumbledore made his annual speech as usual, but this time some extra news appeared. Before he could continue, someone interrupted him by opening the door. A big figure with a cane made its entrance with a huge thunderstorm and the night light in the background. He was there, one of the men who imprisoned my mother and who fought her until she fainted; Mad-Eye Moody.My body was covered in chills and I held a gasp as well as other students who were familiar with the figure and importance of the Auror. I kinda hid behind Draco, sat by my side, hoping he wouldn't look at me and recognise me as Circe Snape's daughter. Moody shared a couple of words with Dumbledore who introduced him as our new DADA teacher and then took a seat next to Snape.

Oh, I was definitely going to miss Professor Lupin.

The big news the old man had for us was the celebration of the Triwizard Tournament. Bloody hell, that shit wasn't celebrated since a fucking century ago..."YOU'RE JOKING!" Fred shouted, as usual, bringing all the attention to him.Everybody giggled, including Dumbledore who was interrupted by McGonagall.Before continuing with the rules, the old man announced this year Hogwarts was going to be the Tournament's host. As soon as he said this, he welcomed the students from Beauxbatons, the magic school from France.The gorgeous girls entered the room with grace, wearing their blue uniforms. One of them stood out over the others and quickly caught most of the masculine attention in the room...and some feminine too.She was tall, blond and with a slender figure. By the energy created in the room, I quickly guessed she was part Veela and even if she wasn't using her magic, she had us all enchanted with her beauty. Ten seconds later, we all knew her name was Fleur Delacour thanks to the gossips happening at the four tables.After their headmistress, Madame Maxime introduced herself. Dumbledore welcomed the students from Drumstrang who made a quite dramatic entrance as well but in their own attempt to do, in what their opinion was, a masculine and Balkan-Nordic style entrance. Leading them, was the well-known Quidditch player, Victor Krum who made a lot of the feminine crew sigh, and a few of the masculine as well.Followed by them, was their headmaster, the ex-Death Eater Karkaroff. Most of the Death Eaters in Azkaban were there because he decided to snitch on them to save his rotten ass from the dementors.After the introductions, we listened carefully to the rules of the Tournament and some people, including the twins, complained about the age limit the trial had. I laughed ironically, who in their healthy mind would want to fight in the Triwizard Tournament? Better throw yourself from a cliff, it would be faster. I guess the thousand galleons award really worthed it...I heard how the twins were planning how to create a potion that would make them older in front of the judge, I kinda understood why they were so mad about not being able to participate; their birthday was in April which was pretty close. Two days after that, we had our first class with Mad-Eye Moody and I was literally terrified. I knew that technically he couldn't attack me or something like that due to Severus position as a professor but, knowing Moody's reputation that claimed he was crazier than ever, I wasn't that sure anymore.We, the Slytherins, were talking in a low voice, chatting about the vibes we got from him the first time he appeared at the Hall and the look he gave to our table when a bunch of loud voices could be heard from the other side of the corridor.

Of fucking course, we had to share this class with the Gryffindors again.

I was literally about to throw up.Plums was leading, smiling and laughing, the little group as she had her arm interlaced with Fred's and Angelina's arms, forming a weird trio. Once they saw with whom they were sharing DADA, they started to laugh even louder and I couldn't help but roll my eyes."What's up, Slytherins? Ready to have the great Mad-Eye Moody after your asses for the rest of the year?" Plums started faking her innocent expression. Some things never change."Shut up, Sienna. You don't want us to put in practice what the Death Eaters taught us before Mad-Eye teaches you how to defend your pathetic selves, do you?" replied a girl a couple of steps away from me. I faked holding my laugh and winked at her, making sure they noticed how we could laugh at them too but with something that clearly was far away from their intelligence; sarcasm. Of course, most of the Slytherins were never close to a Death Eater but the way the rest of the houses demonized us could be a good advantage to, at least, joke about.The class door magically opened and everybody started to enter and pick their seats. When I was about to enter, a tall figure interposed between me and the door. Fred Weasley was staring at me arrogantly with his arms crossed, his eyebrows furrowed and a fake smile while he observed me as if he already knew what I was thinking. Maybe it was the height difference between him and me, but he seemed more intimidating than ever."Ready to follow mommy's path, Lilith? I bet old man Moody would love to continue Snape's family tradition." he teased lowering his voice as if he was confessing something or telling me gossip. "You know, they say Uncle Snape's being more terrifying than ever, he fears Moody so much he's not even able to look at him in any of his eyes."I glared at him, imitating his expression and walked slowly towards him. I passed my index finger long nail through his jawline, making sure it was kinda scratching his skin. His head raised, making his eyes look even more arrogant and his breath became heavier. Adrenaline and heat were running in my veins as I stared at him straight in the eye."Careful, Weasley, perhaps I follow her path too much and end up cursing you an Imperio" I mumbled softly. I winked at him as a cold rage filled his eyes. I didn't wait for a reply and just made my shoulder hit him so I could enter the class. Just like the rest of the Slytherins, I sat at the back of the class, thinking that would make Moody focus on the Gryffindors at the front.The Auror made his entrance, walking badly with his fake leg, scrutinising us with his magic eye, looking devasted from all the scars that covered his face and barely being able to breathe.

How was this man even alive?

"Take your books out of the table, you won't need them," he started with that terrifying voice.The Gryffindors smiled at each other. He grabbed a list and started to pronounce our names."Arambella, Lilith Medea" he pronounced slowly and even from my seat I could see how his eye narrowed. He put the list down and looked at me, sighing hardly."Here, sir.""Are you familiar with Ares Arambella?" he asked. All the eyes in the class were upon me. I swallowed hard.

Why is he asking about him?

"Yes, sir. He's my father." I said monotonously, showing I didn't like to talk about him.He nodded."Then, I guess you are also familiar with Snape."

There it was...

"Yes, sir. Professor Snape is my uncle.""Fair enough. I don't need to ask more, I already know your mother from firsthand," he said grabbing the list again.A deadly silence was followed by a bunch of whispers Moody silenced by hitting his cane against the floor. I squeezed my fists until they were almost swollen.

There was no need at all to mention her, and even less to mention HIM.

I ignored all the eyes on me and the mumbling saying my name or my mother's, to avoid casting a fucking curse to all of them."Right, Professor Lupin informed me about how advanced you are in this subject but I think it is important to clarify some concepts in which I'm sure he didn't dig deeper." Mad-Eye talked again as he cleaned the blackboard and started writing with a piece of chalk."Today we are revising the unforgivable curses," he announced proudly.

Fuck my life.

Everyone in the room seemed to have a lot of tension in their bodies. We weren't children anymore, we all knew pretty well what the unforgivable curses were and how much they affected the wizarding community."Does anyone know what they are? I bet some of our students know them pretty well." Moody started while his fake eye was moving in a really weird way. He looked specifically at where all the Slytherins were, then he took a large gulp from his flask. "Which is the first one?"I swallowed hard, avoiding any kind of eye contact.I knew exactly which one it was."The Imperio one, sir" a girl from Gryffindor replied with a soft voice.Moody agreed and took a little cage with what seemed to be a spider in it. He put the little animal in the girl's desk, who was paler than before."Ok, curse it.""W-what?!" the girl trembled."Curse it," he repeated as if he was asking her to read a paragraph in the book.The poor kid swallowed hard and raised her wand. Almost whispering, she pronounced the Imperius and the animal positioned in such an unnatural posture as if it was a muppet."Move your wand"The girl obeyed and as she moved her wand, the spider followed the movement, it looked like it was tied with strings.Moody made a slow movement and the control of the spider went straight to his wand."Can someone tell me what happened?" he asked as if it was the most common thing in the world.Everyone kept silent. Plums raised her hand but he ignored her. Instead, he went straight to Fred."Weasley?"He had an expression of pure shock as his eyes kept focused on the animal under Moody's spell."She was controlling the spider's body.""Right, with the Imperio curse you can make anyone do whatever you want them to do. If I compelled this animal to drown itself in a cube of water, it would do it without thinking twice. You can control the body but you would not control the mind. That is what makes this curse one of the most traumatic and controversial ones and why it earned its place as one of the Unforgivables."I looked through the window. This was my mother's favourite curse. Fuck off, I bet Merlin himself that it still is. Back in the days when she was an active Death Eater, she used it lots of times to make other people kill in her name so even though she never killed anyone with her bare hands or wand, her psychopathic mind found the way to get rid of her enemies and Voldemort's ones as well. That's why he liked her that much.

I hated it there.

"Which is the second one?"This time it was one of the boys from Slytherin who answered."The Cruciatus one"Mad-Eye took the spider and, limping, walked to the boy and left the animal over his desk."Curse it."The boy shook his head saying 'no' while his eyes were opened widely."Please, sir. Don't make me do it," he whispered.Moody looked at him without any expression on his face full of scars."For Merlin's sake, kids!" he groaned as he grabbed his wand and pointed to the animal. "Crucio!"The creature started to writhe of pure pain and small screams could be heard.I looked to the girl by my side, who happened to be the same who talked back to Plums in the corridor before Moody's entrance. She seemed very disturbed and her eyes were crystallized."This curse causes a huge pain on the individual who suffers it. The kind of pain it implies is something you will know once you get cursed with it because the level it reaches is so high that not even the strongest words could describe to you how it feels. A fact I know from personal experience is that this one is one of the Death Eaters' favourite chant."

Having your bones breaking every second, again and again. Having nails hammered into them. Knifes running through your blood. Your muscles cramping until you feel them exploding. All at the same time. That was how the Cruciatus curse felt according to Snape.

"The last one -" he started again without anyone making any comment. " I think you all know it."I stayed silent, with my hands in fists and my knuckles almost purple because of how much pressure I was putting."Arambella, I'm sure you know it."

Fuck off, bastard.

"I do, professor," I replied calmly and cold.All eyes were on me. We all knew it perfectly. Thanks to the great and glorious Harry Potter, it was the most famous curse of all time."So tell me, should I use it on the spider? Or would you rather be using it on someone?" he said approaching me slowly. I looked at him straight in the eyes, not faltering and challenging him silently. All the fear I had for him before was slowly becoming pure despise and anger. "Weasley, for example, to keep the family traditions going, you know?"

He did not just say that, fucking son of a bitch.

Some people gasped and even though I was not directly looking at Fred nor George, I could notice how both froze and held their breath.I smiled sarcastically."I'm sorry, sir. But I'm not really a follower of family traditions." I replied keeping the calm voice but making sure it sounded bitter enough and without breaking the eye contact.He made a noise, complaining while he put his hands over my desk to make his look even more intimidating."Oh, really? Why Little Snape does not want to continue the legacy?"

The Snape card...already overplayed.

"I'm not a Snape, sir. I'm an Arambella. Everybody seems to forget that.""Yes, that's true," he replied reincorporating again. "For the sake of your marks in this subject, let's hope then you don't follow either the family tradition to abandon."Suddenly, the killing curse sounded pretty tasty to my tongue.I tightened my lips and felt how a huge knot was forming in my throat. I didn't want any of the people in this room to know anything about Ares Arambella or what he did. I already had enough with the 'lunatic mother' joke.Moody turned around quickly with his wand pointing at me.

"Avada Kedavra!"

The air left my body and I closed my eyes as I thought he had actually cursed me but he didn't. I opened my eyes and the spider was absolutely dead over my desk.I returned my look to the Auror, trying to hide the number of emotions that were burning me under my skin."Just to clarify two things, sir; one, Circe Snape did never use the killing curse. And two, maybe all these years in the business made you confuse yourself a bit, but for your own sake, I advise you to learn how to distinguish criminals because you can be certainly sure I'm not my mother. "'IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO PAY FOR WHAT SHE DID.' those words burnt me all inside my body. I wanted to scream at them, I wanted to mark them in everyone's mind.Everyone remained quiet. I could notice how most of them were surprised by the way I talked back to Moody, who after all, was a Professor with a huge authority, but at that moment, I couldn't care less if it was Mad-Eye or Dumbledore himself."Also, I would thank you immensely if you don't mention anything that has to do with Ares Arambella again. The only Arambella that matters in the wizarding world is me."( · · · )After the class finished, I ran away from it as fast as I could and hid in the non-used restroom where I smoked three cigarettes in less than fifteen minutes.I was pretty close to have a panic attack.Why had Mad-Eye pressured me like that? I understood the old man was mad as fuck but, why the fuck would Dumbledore hire someone like him to teach the most controversial subject? Everybody knows that these curses are a forbidden topic inside Slytherin. I, like many other Slytherin kids, didn't want to have anything to do with what our parents did in the past but apparently, we were destined to pay for their crimes.Olivia entered the restroom a few minutes later."Hey, I heard you just had your first class with Professor Moody," she said calmly and sat in one of the sinks. "How was it?"I could not form a single word in my mouth so I simply walked towards her and wrapped my arms around her neck, hugging her while I felt the tears burning in my eyes. Soon, the sobs were impossible to hold back."That bad, huh?" she said softly as she hugged me while rubbing my back. "I'm really sorry, Lilith. Do you want to tell me what happened?""Liv, he mentioned him," I said between sobs and tears while breaking the hug.Olivia opened her eyes and the shock reflected in her face."Are you serious? How could he know him?""I don't know. But that wasn't the only thing. That bastard decided to talk about the unforgivable curses and ordered me to make the killing curse. He wanted me to curse one of the Weasleys and I fucking know he was trying to provoke me, not to literally kill a student in his own class. But I can assure you he knows what my mother did and suggesting me to do that is such a disturbing way to humiliate me." I sat on the floor with my knees bent to my chest and my hands tangled in my hair. "I knew that class was going to be emotionally hard but I never imagined he'd reach this level. Fuck, Liv."More tears ran all over my cheeks. In other situation, I would have wiped them off quickly and just swallowed my feelings but I felt so overwhelmed I couldn't care less."You don't deserve this," she sounded convinced and her voice was rougher than ever. "You don't deserve to pay for your mother sins, they don't even give you a chance to prove you're different from her."She sighed hardly."I can't do anything about Moody, but what about you letting me be around you when the Gryffindors are close? I bet they won't let this be."

Fuck, I didn't even think about them.

"No," I answered back. "No, no, absolutely not. You already have all Ravenclaws bothering you, do you really want to deal with another fucking entire house against you? No, I will not allow it."Her eyes were serious and her voice kept that unusual hard tone."Lilith, you are my sister. We might not share blood but be sure you certainly are. I can't let you on your own."She was right, we might be from completely different families, but I considered her more my blood than any other person with the Snape or Arambella last names. And that was exactly why I could not let her be around me as much as I would like to. I already learnt how to deal with the mockery and the despise, I was used to it, but I knew that Olivia was way more sentimental than me and even if she pretended not to, she did care a lot about what the Ravenclaws said to her. When you are a Slytherin who also happens to be a Death Eater's child, you are born to be rejected and hated."Let's not talk about that right now, shall we? I just need to smoke all these cigarettes, get back to the Slytherin common room and listen to that bloody muggle band you love that much."She slightly smiled and agreed. We both picked up our stuff and got out of the restroom. As she went to her common room to grab the cassettes I went to the Slytherin one. I walked through the corridor, ignoring everyone in my way, but I couldn't ignore a particular pair of eyes that were staring intensely at me. And for the first time, they didn't have the usual angry of arrogant bright in them.Fred Weasley was looking at me, leaned against a column next to George, with his arms crossed against his chest, pretending to listen to his twin's words.However, he didn't look as if he wanted to curse me.

That was new...

The day continued as all of us had other classes. I was still upset about the whole Moody situation but there wasn't anything I could do about it.I walked to the Hall to have the lunch break and I found Liv chatting with some girls from Hufflepuff, even though the Ravenclaws were annoying as fuck with her, her own house always treated her with full respect and love. I tried not to catch her attention since I didn't want to interrupt but her eyes found mine and she made a little sign with her hand, inviting me to join her.I mouthed 'No, it's okay' because I knew that even though Hufflepuffs were the nicest people out there, I didn't want to bother their conversation. Instead, I grabbed some coffee and cookies and went straight to the Slytherin table where Draco was complaining about something while his mates were trying to hold their laughs."Hey!" I said, sitting next to Draco with Pansy and Blaise in front of me. "What are you complaining about now, mate?" I asked the blonde."Ferret boy is mad at Professor Moody" Pansy intervened before Draco could speak. His eyebrows were furrowed and his light blonde hair was a bit messed."Who?""Draco. He was messing with Potter, as usual, and Professor Moody stopped him by turning him into a ferret and literally made him flew with his wand" Blaise explained.I held my laugh as well."Did he?""Yeah," Draco mumbled, taking angrily his apple juice box and sipping fast. "My father will definitely hear about this.""Don't do it, Draco. Moody hates us Slytherins enough for you to bring daddy Malfoy here. I just had a class with him and it was a fucking nightmare!""Let me guess. He talked about your mum?" Draco asked me, as Blaise and Pansy paid more attention. I knew they were conscient about who Circe was, but Draco was far more involved because of his father and our friendship."Innit," I replied taking my coffee. "But he mentioned also other things that I find quite triggering, and he made us cast the unforgivable curses."Draco whistled showing he was in shock and Pansy and Blaise had their eyes and mouths opened."Isn't that illegal?" Pansy asked."Yes, but go tell Dumbledore," I said ironically knowing damn well that old man wouldn't care."Well, the Gryffindors from my course are fucking happy about our first class with him. I've seen Potter asking the Weasley twins how their first class went and both said it was awesome. Those bloody carrots..."My eyes went straight to the Gryffindor table where the mentioned Weasleys were chatting with the golden trio."Yeah, I bet they enjoyed it.""By the way, tomorrow starts the seek for the participants of the Tournament. Finally, Potter won't be the damn protagonist!" Draco spat, full of arrogance.( . . . )The next day we were all relaxing at the hall again, with the Goblet of Fire in the centre of the room surrounded by a line of Merlin knows what kind of dust Dumbledore cast there, watching the potential competitors. I was on one of the stairs with the Charms book over my lap, completing my homework. In less than two hours, the whole Drumstrang school had put their names on the Goblet and all of them walked winking their eyes to every girl they saw. The only one who seemed not to care about all the feminine and masculine attention he was getting, was the well-known Krum.Then, some of the girls from Beauxbatons put their names as well while receiving the hype from their own friends and a huge amount of the male population.After that, trying to be the one who represented Hogwarts, Cedric threw his name to Goblet too while he was surrounded by his group of friends, between them Olivia, who waved at me. She was incredibly happy since one of her friends from Hufflepuff asked her to go to the Yule Ball.I smiled at her and got back to work.A few seconds later, some shouts of joy could be heard. The Weasley twins, followed by their unconditional friend Lee Jordan, entered the room running while they were holding a blue potion in their hands. All the Gryffindors clapped and congratulated them."Thank you! Thank you!" George said while he high-fived some of his mates."The Ageing Potion" Fred said talking to Harry "We just had it"."A single drop each of us," George replied, with a happy smile on his face. " We only need to be a couple of months older."It's not going to work."It's not going to work!" Hermione chanted ironically, almost as if she had read my mind.The twins looked at each other and, at the same time, sat one of them at each side of Hermione."You think so?" Fred asked.She replied something I couldn't hear but she was pointing at the line that surrounded the Goblet, so I guessed it had something to do with Dumbledore's magic, which was really far away from the twins' capacity.As she was speaking, I didn't notice I was deeply staring at them until Fred's eyes met mine. Even in the distance, I could see them bright with mischief and wildness. The soft and gentle expression his face had before while speaking to Granger, changed quickly as he recognised me, to an arrogant and distant expression. Without saying a word or even smiling, he stood up with his brother by his side and jumped into the circle.Nothing happened, and everyone cheered them up. They put the little papers in the Goblet and at first, it looked like their stupid idea was stupid enough to surpass Dumbledore's mind, but suddenly, two blue flames blew to their faces and threw them out of the circle. When they stood up, their faces started to get old and full of wrinkles as their hair grew and became grey. Both twins started to blame each other while they fought and walked away, speaking about how they could go back to normal.Ugh, I don't give a fuck about who Fred Weasley is marrying but I definitely feel sorry for them! They would not only be marrying a cocky bitch but he is going to be such an ugly man too.After that bizarre situation, I focused on the homework. Damn, Flitwick, I'm not a fucking Rave, you could be gentler!"Did they really thought their potion would work?" a melodic voice with a mix of French accent spoke.A beautiful girl with the Beauxbatons uniform was sitting by my side. Her dark skin was shining with the little winter sun coming from the windows, making her even more attractive, her afro black hair included two locks and other decorations in her curls that showed her pride in her beautiful culture. She seemed very gentle so I smiled at her."Yeah, well, get used to them. Gryffindors tend to think they are the superior ones out there." I giggled. "I'm Lilith""Pauline Bélier""Beauxbatons, huh?" I pointed at her uniform. "Are you participating in the Tournament?""No, no! I value my life too much not to even think about it.""Yeah, me too. I wouldn't survive a day in it."She covered the room with her eyes."I really like the vibe you have in here. Last year I made an exchange to the Magic School in the USA, Ilvermorny, and didn't enjoy it as much as I'm enjoying this. You all are very kind."I sighed, ironic."Well, thank you, but don't think it's perfect. You are gonna find everything in here; pure-blood obsessed, bitchy know-it-alls, kind people, and the main-character-complex ones."She snickered."In which one do you fit?""Technically, in the pure-blood ones but I'm a half-blood so...""Nah, it's still cool. People here seem to respect my heritage."I nodded even though I didn't know what she was talking about but I thought it would be extremely rude to ask her about it."I'm not entirely French" She replied as if she had read my mind. "My parents are from Senegal and Cameroon. They moved to France when they got married since my grandmére lives there. You can guess the kind of comments I've been getting in other places.""Yes, I think I get what you say. So annoying, right?""I'm black and a witch, so most of the time people think I'm gonna do voodoo to them."We both laughed."You should definitely pretend you do it only to shut their mouths. Sometimes fear makes you gain respect."She looked at me surprised."You know what? You're right. I like it!""Thank you! Listen, now I gotta go to my Charms class, but later I will hang out with my best friend, do you wanna come?""Yeah, sure!""Great, wait for me at the fourth corridor in front of the wooden door. I'll meet you there." I said grabbing my stuff. "Bye, Pauline!"She waved to me as I walked out of the place. I ran all over the corridor just to arrive in time for the class.Flitwick opened the door and we all took seats. As he started the class, I hear behind me Jordan's voice."Oi, Fred, who are you taking to the Ball?""I'm planning to ask one of the girls from Beauxbatons...""Brave move, man! But I heard Fleur is already taken...""Nah, I've seen another pretty one, I think her name's Pauline Bélier or something like that."

"Any plan B left?""Just improvise, mate.""The Slytherin girls, maybe?""Nah" he chuckled. "I'll rather ask out one of the Drumstrang men before taking a Slytherin to the Ball with me."Fucking idiot."Weasley, Jordan, I would thank you if you pay attention to the class!" Flitwick intervened.( . . . )When the class was over I walked fast to meet Pauline. I found Liv on my way to the fourth corridor since she was coming out of the dungeons."Hey, how was Potions?" I asked her as she said goodbye to her mates and joined me."Boring, as usual." she sighed putting her books against her chest. "Snape is gonna make us prepare Amortentia.""You're joking!""I wish I was."Damn you, Severus."Oh, by the way, I met this girl from Beauxbatons before and I invited her to hang out with us, do you mind?""Of course not! I'm completely fine with it! YOU SOCIALIZING WITH SOMEONE OTHER THAN DRACO AND ME? THAT'S NEWS" she joked."You bitch." I replied giving her a little punch in her shoulder.We saw Pauline in the distance and waved at her, I introduced Olivia to her and both smiled at each other.I opened the restroom door."Welcome to our secret place, Pauline! It's not as elegant as France but it's only ours." I started while sitting in one of the sinks and grabbing my pack of cigarettes. I offered one to both."It's cool. I like it!"Olivia sighed."I'm confused," she said suddenly."Here comes the therapy session," I announced and Liv took a seat on the floor while Pauline sat in the sink next to me. "Why?""You know Matthews asked me to go with him to the Ball, right?""Yeah.""And you know I said yes?""Yeah.""Okay, what if he thinks I said 'yes ' because I like him? He's been a bit too touchy today...""Wait, you have told him you're lesbian, haven't you?" I said while I lightened my cigarette.She stayed silent."OLIVIA MARIE LOVEGOOD! YOU HAVEN'T?" I ask shocked as Pauline opened her eyes widely."Maybe I forgot..." Liv whispered in an innocent tone, playing with her nails."Oh, for fuck's sake, Liv!" I took my index and my thumb to my nose."I don't know who that boy is, but you are literally gorgeous! If you don't tell him you are not interested in him, he's gonna fall for you" Pauline advised."You think so?" Liv blushed."Absolutely!""Maybe I can tell him I only see him as a friend without telling him I'm gay, I don't think I'm ready to come out.""And that's completely fine" I replied supporting her. Pauline nodded with her head, agreeing with me."What about you, Lilith?""I don't have any partner yet but anyway, unless I go with Draco, I think I'd go alone.""And you, Pauline?"She sighed, amused."Same as Lilith."Then, I remembered what I heard Fred saying during Charms and a great idea popped off on my mind.A little revenge is always good."Why don't we go together?" I offered her, talking really fast."Huh?""Yeah, let's go together. I've heard that one of the boys from Gryffindor wants to invite you to the Ball, but I have a lot of trouble with him so I want to piss him off a little bit. What could be better than stealing his partner?"Pauline started laughing."So you are using me to get revenge on him?"I looked at her surprised. If she says like that it looks like I'm a bad person."Well, no...but - maybe? I don't want to use you. I think we can have so much fun together and at the same time I can piss him off. " I replied trying to find an excuse. Pauline laughed even harder."It's okay. I'm in, I bet it's going to be funny so I'm in," she said proudly as she high-fived me."I think I already know the answer but, is that Gryffindor one of the Weasley copies?" Liv asked."Ugh, yeah""Weasley 1 or Weasley 2?""Who do you think, Liv?""I bet it was Fred." she chuckled."You're right, I'm tired of him and his fucking arrogance."Liv laughed again and gave Pauline an undecipherable look that the other girl gave her back."What?" I asked them both."Nothing," they said at the same time but I could notice how something else that the two of them knew, was not clicking in my mind.Weird..."Shall we grab some chocolate? I'm starving." I complained, changing the topic."Sure, dancing partner," Pauline said with a smile still on her face.

After spending some time with the girls at the Hall, I had to go to the library since Professor Sprout wanted us to do some research about the plant we were studying. When I got there, it seemed almost empty except for a bunch of Hufflepuffs and two Slytherins.I searched through the shelves for the name of the plant but couldn't find anything. Fuck! Herbology wasn't exactly my thing."Damn, Snape!" I heard a little whisper. When I turned around, I found one of the Gryffindor boys from Year 4, sitting at a table alone while looking desperate to figure out his Potions notes. I did know who the boy was; Neville Longbottom, the almost 'Chosen One'. My uncle had a very unexplainable rage against that poor boy.Feeling pity for him, I approached slowly to his place.

I know I shouldn't do it, he is a Gryffindor who, obviously, hates Snape. What in Earth would make me think he's gonna be nice to me?

"Hello, are you struggling with your Potions assignment?" I said with the nicest tone I could.He lifted his head with a confused expression on his face."No, no, I'm doing okay. Please don't tell your uncle - I-I mean, p-professor Snape - I'm bad at this, he will make me perform it in front of the class and I'm t-terrible." he sighed, full of desperation."Oh, no! Don't worry, I don't mean to tell professor Snape anything. I just saw you having a hard time with that and I thought I could help you since I already studied it two years ago." I offered him sincerely. "You're Neville Longbottom, right?"He nodded."Can I take a seat?""Yeah, I s'pose," he seemed a bit uncomfortable but for some reason, I really felt the need to help this boy. Especially, because I knew what a fucking bastard Severus could be with the list of students he didn't like, and apparently, poor Neville was on top of that list."What's your assignment?"He showed me his notes and I took Severus' book from my bag."Listen, this is my personal Potions book. Here I have some notes that include exceptions you can make with some ingredients so your potion ends up being perfect. Look, for this one you're making, it's better if you use beetle eye instead of borage, it would make the colour brighter and healthier." I advised him, showing the modified instructions. He took his cauldron and followed what the book said. Ten minutes later, his potion was looking exactly like the book image."Oh, Merlin! Thank you so much, Ms Snape" he said with a big smile.

He is really nice, remind me again how is he in Gryffindor?

"Anytime, mate. But don't call me that, I'm not Snape, I'm Arambella, or what it's better, Lilith." I said, emphasising my name."Okay, Lilith""Now I gotta go." I started, sighing while standing up from the chair. "I need to find the damn book about the damn plant Professor Sprout asked me about.""Wait!" he stopped me once I was already searching in the shelves. "I never thought I would be helping a Slytherin, even less Snape's niece herself," he chuckled nervously. "But Professor Moody gave me this Herbology book from Sprout's personal library. I already took some notes so, maybe, you can have it till you end your assignment."I took the book in my hands. It was quite heavy but it seemed very complete and useful. I looked at him with a smile."Thank you very much! Maybe I'm being too curious but, why did Moody give it to you?"His smile disappeared slowly and he sighed hardly."Well, I had a bit of a rough time in his class today.""I'm really sorry. He was a bastard to us too, talking about the unforgivable curses."His eyes opened widely but he didn't say any other word."Well, now I definitely gotta go, but hope I see you soon!" I talked as I walked away still being as nice as possible.This poor kid did not only had to deal with the Slytherins, some of the people in his own house, my uncle but also with the fact that his parents went by what they went through in the past.I walked through the corridor which was full of students from younger years. Some of them were even talking about how 'fucking amazing' Moody's classes were. Ugh. In the distance I recognised Pauline's beautiful hair and uniform, she seemed to be talking with someone since she was looking up with a funny expression on her face.As I was getting near them, I recognised the person who was talking to the Bélier girl; Fred fucking Weasley, who else could it be, right? I made eye contact with Pauline, she smirked at me and I knew that was my moment. I started walking towards them."So I thought we could go together to the Ball if you want." I heard Fred saying, with a flirty smile and a gentle tone. The fucking bitch could be really attractive when he wanted if it wasn't because he was a bitch."I would love to but-" Pauline started nervously."But she's already going with me." I interrupted her while putting an arm around her shoulders. Lucky me she was my height. "So, piss off, Weasley"Fred looked at me up to down with notorious confusion and disdain on his face. His eyebrows furrowed and his brown eyes narrowed."Are you joking?" he scoffed with his typical arrogant voice that used with me."What makes you think I am? Do I look like a clown to you?" I replied looking at him with the most serious face."Are you really asking that and not expecting me to answer you something offensive? C'mon, mate..." he said, sarcastically while pointing at me and then at him, keeping his other hand in the pocket of his tight trousers."Fuck you, Weasley." I smiled at him with my most cynic and ironic smile while I showed him the middle finger. " But don't worry, mate. You can still find a partner for the Ball, maybe any of the Drumstrang boys wants to go with you." I added faking an innocent tone, but showing him I had listened to his previous conversation with Jordan and looking him straight in the eye while Pauline was holding her laugh behind me.Fred smiled arrogantly, looked at his feet while slowly shaking his head and with his mouth slightly open showing how he was biting the tip of his tongue with his front teeth."Fair enough, Lilith," he replied calmly. "Anything's better than a Slytherin girl."I walked in his direction, ending up a bit closer than what I meant in the first place."It's not like any of us would go with a Gryffindor boy. I'll rather take Filch and his cat before going with any of you." I replied keeping the same smile.He lifted his head with even more arrogance and a gesture with his lips."Keep dreaming any Gryffindor would want you, dear," he whispered. "And just for your information, Moody's next class is tomorrow, maybe you want to ask some advice to the Death Eater you have as an uncle so you don't make the performance you did last time. It was quite pathetic."Without letting me say any other word, he slightly chuckled and turned around leaving me with a really entertained Pauline, who was leaned against the wall as she ate popcorn that she made appeared magically."Having fun, huh?" I talked to her, more calm and amused."Indeed," she chuckled. "What was that?!"I sighed back."Fred Weasley being an idiot. Nothing new. See why I told you I wanted to have some revenge?""Uhmm, yeah - Wait, in what category does he fit?""In the main-character complex," I answered walking in the Hall direction interlacing my arm to Pauline's."I kinda see why.""You know? I like you more every day, mate. I think you would fit well in the nice people"."Nah, I'm a bitchy know-it-all, sorry.""Well, you couldn't be perfect, could you?" I winked at her and her smile widened.We found Olivia at the Hall, sitting with Cedric. Since they were at one of the most distant tables, we sat with them."Wotcher.""Lith" Cedric replied smiling at me."How's everything going, Ced? Do you already know if you are in the Tournament?""No" he sighed. "They'll say tomorrow who the competitors are. I'm really nervous, you know?""Yeah, I bet so," I said grabbing one of the crisps from Olivia's bag. She looked at me with narrowed eyes. Never take Olivia's food, best friend advice. "Oh, by the way, I'm out of cigarettes, can you get me a new pack?""Yeah, sure. I will see my father tomorrow, he comes to see if I'm elected. I'm sure he will bring some packs from the Muggle section of the Ministry.""Thanks, mate" I winked at him."Anytime." he smiled back.My story with Diggory was quite funny. We became friends when I was in Year 3 and I started smoking. Since I couldn't get the packs by my own - it's not like I can go to Snape's office and be like 'Hey uncle Sev, can you get me some cigs please?'- I talked to one of the older boys from Slytherin who told me that Cedric Diggory, the good boy himself, was the one bringing the cigarettes directly from his father, thanks to his work at the Ministry. After some good chats and a good connection, I lost my virginity to him in our 14s and had a really good couple encounters after that, but soon, he met Cho Chang and started fancying her so we both decided that we could stay as good friends."Wow, you two seem to be very good friends," Pauline said with a smile."Of course they are, they fucked." Liv replied as if it was the most innocent and normal thing in the world, drinking her coffee and making Cedric choke with his."Olivia!" I giggled."Off-topic but, why did it take you so long to get here? I thought you only went to the library to get a book," she asked looking at me. "Cedric saw me here on my own while waiting for you two, and was kind enough to offer me his company, good boy." she tapped his head as if he was a dog."Ugh, don't even remind me. I had a moment with Weasley 1" I answered, frustrated."And what a moment!" Pauline replied amused."Was it a moment like I think it was?" she asked Pauline, smiling."It definitely was," Pauline said high-fiving her. "I even had to make appear some popcorn."Both started laughing loudly and Cedric followed them with a more discreet smile while I scowled, confused.

What, for Merlin'

sake, are these two on?

That morning, I was about to have my second class with Mad-Eye, and I was really scared of it being even worse than the previous one. It was pretty clear that Moody didn't like me, but after what he said about my parents, the feeling was both ways.I ignored the anxious Gryffindors and the quiet Slytherins and just waited, leaned against one of the windows. The door opened magically again and I went straight through it to catch one of the seats in the back before Weasley or any other Gryff could mess with me again.Moody made his entrance just as the last day, using his cane to support his tired body. He looked all over the room but didn't ask again our names. I bet after the last situation he already knew who we all were.His eyes focused on me for a few seconds and it looked like he had almost smiled."Today, we are going to continue with the last class' topic," he announced."You've got to be joking," I complained in a whisper."But this time, we are going to practise it."A bunch of mumbles started to fill the room."Isn't that illegal?" George Weasley asked."Not if we do it with academic purposes," Mad-Eye replied, making us stand up and using the magic to put the desks against the wall so there was more space in the room. "Now, make two groups. Slytherins in this side, Gryffindors in the other."We did what he said, the Gryffindors with a clear expression of doubt in their faces, and us, trying to remain as close to each other as possible. Moody positioned himself next to the Gryffindors."Now, who remembers the first curse we talked about?" he asked."The Imperio" a girl behind me replied in a little mumble.Without looking at me, Moody pointed his cane in my direction:"Right, to keep the family traditions, Arambella, here."

Oh, for fuck's sake.

Taking all my willpower, I gave two steps forward so I was in the middle of the circle as well.I looked at the Gryffindor group and all of them were with their eyes on me and interesting faces."Arambella, curse me."

What?!

I felt my shoulders lose their tension because of the surprise his words gave me."I beg you pardon?" I asked again, hoping it was only a hallucination.Some people held their breath and others gasped slightly."Curse me with the Imperio."This couldn't be true. He knew exactly that the only thing he was achieving with this was to make everyone believe that, after all, I was my mother's daughter.I narrowed my eyes and made a gesture of despising with my lips."No." I refused, coldly. "No. No. I will not do this."I gave two steps back and Moody looked at me with fury in his eyes."Curse me, Arambella," he insisted. "It's not like you don't know the curse.""You don't dare to use the curse that your mother perfectionated and embraced?" Plums shouted at the back of the Gryffindor group, cynic, and making some of them laugh."If you don't do it, Arambella, you will force me to send you to the head of your house," he threatened."Fine! Do it! I'm telling you I'm not doing the bloody curse." I shouted."Out!" he growled, grinding his teeth and pointing his cane to the door. Everybody remained silent as I grabbed my bag and went out of there."Since Little Snape doesn't have what it takes to do the curse, we are going to leave the practice till next day and focus now on the next topic..." I heard Mad-Eye say as I walked through the empty corridor knowing damn well where I was going.The fury and rage that was running through my veins manifested itself in a fast and violent walk and heavier breathing. Once I arrived in front of the black door, I took a deep breath trying to calm myself and I knocked twice. I opened the door without waiting for an answer and found Snape's eyes focusing on from his newspaper to me."What are you doing here?" he asked. "You should be in Defence Against the Dark Arts.""Moody kicked me out of class," I answered sitting in the chair in front of his desk."What? Can't you stay a day without getting in trouble or needing me to solve your problems? I told you to keep a low profile and not catch his attention, but of course, why on Earth would you listen to me? I'm never-""He tried to make me cast the Imperio" I interrupted him speaking over his voice.He silenced himself immediately and looked at me with a face full of surprise."Is this any kind of joke of yours, Lilith?""I wish it was." I laughed cynic. "But no, he wanted us to practise the unforgivable curses.""That's illegal." he interrupted me."He said it was for academic purposes.""Still illegal.""He said he wanted me to continue the family tradition and ordered me to curse him with that.""And you refused to, I suppose," he said furrowing his eyebrows."Yes, so he said I had to go to the head of my house's office. And here I am." I answered. "Severus, he's not going to leave it there, he wants me to do the Imperio and to prove I'm just like my mother. He won't stop until I do it."Snape's facial expression went from confusion to anger."Do not worry. I'll fix this," he said tightening his jaw. "Now, go to your common room."I nodded and picked my bag again to leave his office. I didn't go to the common room but to the Hall where I found Cedric all by himself."You look lonely," I said as I approached him. "Can I sit?""Sure!" he replied with a big smile."Oi! Do you already know the results from the Goblet?" I couldn't be here in the morning." I remembered suddenly."Yeah..." he sighed hard and looked pretty disappointed. Oh, no. "I'm one of the competitors!" he announced changing his expression to a huge smile."Fuck, mate! You scared me!" I said as I gave him a soft punch in the arm. "But, congratulations! That's really cool! Who are the other two competitors?""Actually, three." he corrected me. Wait, what? "Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum from Durmstrang...and Potter.""Who?!" I almost shouted. "How is he a competitor?""I don't know. Everyone's saying he put his name in the Goblet.""But how could he? We all saw what happened to the Weasleys when they tried.""No idea, mate. I suppose we can only expect him to, at least, survive the Tournament.""Yeah, I s'pose so," I replied, still pretty confused. I looked to the door and saw Cho Chang, Cedric's love interest, entering the Hall. "Look, your girl's over there. I should go." I said as a caught one of the chocolates he had on his table."Bye, Lith! You owe me chocolate!" I heard him say as I left the place.This time, I did go to the Slytherin common room. When I entered it, I saw Draco sitting on the stairs that took to the individual dungeons, drinking a little box of apple juice. He seemed disappointed and confused as he looked to the floor."You good?" I asked him, leaning against the wall he was giving the back to."A few days ago, I said that finally, he was not going to be the damn protagonist, and now, look. Why does he have to be ALWAYS the damn protagonist?" he complained looking like a little boy. " I hate him" he sipped his juice with his eyes still focused on the wall.I held my laugh."You wish you were him, huh?"He looked at me from the corner of his eye. "Yes," he replied quickly, taking again the straw to his mouth. "I want to kill him too, though."I freed my laugh and left him there, not without giving him a little cuddle in his hair before, to get back to my dorm.

Oh, Draco, if you only knew how much you improved my shitty day...

( · · · )I spent the rest of the day sleeping, doing homework, and talking to Olivia and Pauline. I explained to them what happened with Moody and had to give Pauline a bit of the previous context about my family's history so she knew why he hated me so much. The two of them agreed that he went too far with the curse.I wasn't ready to confront him again today, but it wasn't like if I could skip the class.

Damn, if only I could have Professor Lupin back.

I repeated the same procedure I did yesterday; ignore the lions and make sure I was as far as possible from the ex-Auror.When we entered the room, he was already there, with the desks in the same positions as yesterday, which meant that he wanted us to continue to practise magic.

I really hope Snape talked to him...

"Okay, class, make a little circle," he ordered and cleared his throat. "We are going to continue practising the curses."The air started to feel heavier and everyone stayed close to each other. At that moment, the stormy clouds from outside seemed more interesting than ever."Since Little Snape complained to her uncle about how I do my classes, I'm going to use her as an example again. Just for your information, Arambella, he had to use McGonagall to tell me about it because he wasn't brave enough to do it himself.""Bastard" I grumbled in a whisper."Come here."I obeyed without hesitation. I was not going to allow him to humiliate me again."Since you don't want to curse me," he started putting the sleeves of his jacket in his elbow and grabbing his wand with firmness. "and I do have to teach these kids anyway, I'll curse you." he finished as if he was referring to the most common and normal thing in the world.I felt the blood becoming ice in my veins and the air leaving my body. Every single person in the room, except him, had their eyes open widely and their brows lifted. None of them did expect that.I didn't say a word, just stood there with more firmness, stoic, and with no expression on my face. Even though on the inside, I felt a hurricane going on. That seemed to annoy him even more."Imperio!" he cursed and I felt the magic hit me.I felt like if my body didn't belong to me anymore, like if my consciousness was trapped and jailed in the deepest part of my brain while every single one of my muscles was made of rocks and was covered by threads, making me a human muppet.Moody's eyes were looking at mine with eager curiosity, I forced myself not to show how actually scared I was. I couldn't even swallow on my own."You see this, kids? She is now completely under my will. She is not more than a muppet or a doll, I could make her jump out of that window and kill herself and she will do it without hesitation." he said devilishly. "Her mother used to love this curse, I bet Little Snape would have already done it to all of us if it wasn't because of that pathetic fake moralism she's trying to prove."I tried to own again my breath and my body, but I couldn't. His magic was way stronger than my quiet one.

Please, make it stop. Please, make it stop.

"As you can see, I'm not forcing her to be quiet but she's so full of herself and all that Snape Death Eater pride, she wants us to believe she's not scared about this.""Profesor Moody..." I heard George Weasley talking in a little insecure mumble. I couldn't look at him since my eyes were fixed to the desk behind Mad-Eye. "Isn't this too much?""Too much? The fun has just started, Mr Weasley!"I noticed how my feet started to walk by themselves in a kinda robotic and creepy way to my left, in the twins' direction. What was he going to make me do?"Now, I'm going to show you how I can control her speech. Arambella, you are going to tell the Weasleys what your mother did to their family and how they are going next once she's out of Azkaban."

No. No, please, no.

I struggled, trying to fight the curse in my body, but it was too powerful."Circe Snape commanded the death of your Prewett uncles. She ordered her servants to drown them. Once she is out of Azkaban, you two will be next." I heard how the words left my mouth and how my lips moved against my will. George gasped and looked paler than before and Fred held his breath, redirecting his eyes to his shoes."Well done, Arambella." Moody talked, showing evil happiness. "Now, back to your place."My legs moved again to the place where I was before and I couldn't stop thinking about how mentally painful this was."I'm going to leave you now." he put his wand down and the immediate feeling of control over my body overwhelmed me, so I fell on my knees to the floor. A single tear abandoned my right eye and travelled down my cheek as I kept eye contact with Mad-Eye. He was, certainly, proud of himself.I breathed deeply and looking at him in the eye with the heaviest and deathly look on my face, I talked, with the coldness running in the words:"Are you happy now, Professor?""Class is over," he replied, turning around.I stood up slowly, feeling my legs quite weak, and grabbed my bag to leave the room.

How did he dare to use that bloody curse on me? What did Snape tell him that did not work at all for Moody to hurt me like this? I feel sick, tired, and almost violated.

As I walked away, I noticed how someone grabbed my arm and walked me to the empty corridor that took me to the abandoned restroom. Fred Weasley pinned me against the wall and put one of his hands in my neck. His fingertips felt like fire on my skin."What the fuck is wrong with you?!" I shouted at him."Tell me the fucking truth, Lilith." he groaned. "That wasn't the Imperio, right? It was you.""Are you out of your mind?" I grumbled. "I'm the last person that wants to see Circe Snape out of Azkaban. I think my boggart said it pretty clear, Weasley."He tightens his jaw making it sharper."I don't care if she's your boggart. I don't care what she does to you. If she or you dare to hurt my family again, I won't hesitate to use your own damn curse against you."The anger covered me from up to down and it took all my strength to grab the collar of his shirt and switch the positions. In milliseconds, I took my wand out of my pocket and put it against his cheek, with my hand still on his collar, pressing."Threaten me again, Weasley, and maybe I'll reconsider the family tradition with you. Your own eyes saw how that fucking bastard cursed me and forced me to repeat those words. After all these years and everything you have told me, I would have all the damn right to curse you a bloody cruciatus. I'm not Circe nor a murderer, don't make me become one."I took the wand out of his face and without waiting for his reply, I walked away, leaving him with his stupid emotions.I went to the only place where I certainly knew I would be comforted with real affection.Liv's room.

After talking with Olivia for almost two hours and rememorizing all my childhood traumas with her, as I always did, I went back to the Slytherin common room where I ignored Draco and any other person around.I certainly wanted to talk to Snape after what Moody told me about him. I knew I didn't matter to him that much, but knowing he wasn't able to confront the mad man himself, hurt me deeply. Even if he did not like it, I was still his niece.The next day, I forced myself to move out of bed. I was not planning at all to go to my DADA class, at least, not by now. I sat in the little garden outside of the classes, reading a book from one of my assignments."Hey, Lilith!" I heard someone walk up to me. Draco was in front of me with a huge smile and an ugly badge that switched between 'Potter Stinks' and 'Support Cedric Diggory - The Real Hogwarts Champion'. "Do you want one?" he said, showing it off, proudly."Seriously, mate?" I asked with sarcasm. "I couldn't care less about who wins the damn Tournament.""Oh, c'mon, Lith! I thought you'd be on my team." Cedric interrupted with a smile on his face. Draco looked at him and simply, left, followed by Crabbe and Goyle."I'm being honest, mate. I mean, of course, I hope you win, but I'm not really into this Potter hate. Believe me, I have enough things to worry about at the moment.""I don't have anything to do with those badges Malfoy is sharing out. I don't really think Potter put his name in the goblet, not after what he told me today earlier...""What did he say?""He told me about the first task. He didn't have to but he did.""What is it?"He sighed before answering me, not completely sure if he should tell me or not."Dragons. One for each of us, I really hope I don't get the bloody Hungarian horntail."I looked at him, surprised."And the fuck are you supposed to do with them? Train them?" I burst out.Cedric laughed, "I really don't know. I suppose they will tell us before the day arrives."(. . . )"I can't believe they haven't told us yet" Cedric complained.He was incredibly nervous about the Tournament and couldn't even have a proper rest."C'mon Ced, I know you will do great!"We were sitting together again in the garden since I decided to skip again the DADA class. It was the third time this week and, apparently, because of the Tournament, Cedric could also skip certain classes, so we ended up spending a little bit more time together."Diggory?"Both, Ced and I, turned around at the same time just to find Fred Weasley looking at us, confused."Hey, Weasley, how are you?" Cedric asked, gently.I kept my eyes on Fred, knowing well the expression on my face showed how annoyed I was because of his presence. He didn't look at me twice."You are friends with her?"Ced looked at me, still smiling."Uhm, yeah. We've been really good friends for a long time, haven't we?""Definitely.""I need to talk to Arambella, can you give us a moment, please?" I stared at him with the most surprising face ever. He had not looked at me once, and I hadn't seen him since our last fight, why would he want to talk with me and about what?Cedric gazed at me kinda confused, but the firmness in Fred's eyes intimidated the two of us."Yeah, sure! Uhm, I have to see Cho anyway. Bye, Lith!"I kept my eyes on Fred, waiting patiently for him to dare to look at me."What do you want?" I asked, coldly.He was now looking over me, as if he was trying to avoid me or as if he didn't really want to be there. After a few seconds that seemed to last forever, he mumbled something I could not understand."Come again?""I said I wanted to apologise." he spat, focusing his eyes on his shoes. "For - what I said to you the other day, maybe it was a bit too much."Is this another joke?"Wow, you definitely don't see this every day. Did George knock some sense into you?"He finally looked at me, he was looking tired and almost annoyed what made me think that he really did not want to be there. I still couldn't believe he was actually apologising."He didn't. I just thought about it and noticed that even though I don't doubt you would be able to say that, in this case, I saw how Moody cursed you. So, again and for the last time, don't get used to this, I'm sorry."I examined him up to down."Shitty apology, Weasley, but I accept it. Just shut your mouth the next time.""This doesn't mean we are going to become friends, Arambella. I was trying to be a good person. Still think you're a bitch."I rolled my eyes."If you have nothing else to say..." I replied, picking my bag, ready to leave him there."So Diggory, huh?" he intervened."Excuse me?""Mate, he's with Chang. If he's actually interested in you it would only be because he wants to fuck you, y'know, one night stand probably, not because he wants to be your friend."I held my laugh."If you knew..." I whispered. I left him there, alone, and walked away.I found Pauline in the corridor, she told me everyone in Beauxbatons was already talking about the first task and the dragons and I heard that even Charlie Weasley himself was in Hogwarts to keep the animals safe.Not more Weasleys, please...I really wondered how Potter was doing knowing what was coming for him.( . . . )The dragon hit Potter again, for the fifth time in less than two minutes. Draco was enjoying it a bit too much.Krum, Fleur, and Cedric did absolutely great with their dragons, but Potter seemed to have absolute bad luck since the poor kid had to fight the Hungarian Horntail. Harry ran to hide behind some rocks and the animal followed him throwing its fire in Potter's direction.Harry, you blithering idiot, grab your fucking wand!"Harry, your wand!" Hermione shouted, at the other corner of the stadium. Of course, the Gryffindors were at one side, and of course, the Slytherins were at the other.Harry cast an Accio and his broom made an iconic entrance, letting him have a little bit of advantage over the dragon. Everyone burst into cheers.My eyes went for a few seconds to the Gryffindors seats and quickly found Weasley. He was focused on Harry, with his eyebrows furrowed and his jaw a bit tense, really concentrated.I don't know why I felt that soft warmth in my stomach when he apologised. It wasn't too much but in all these years, he never apologised. Not even once. I did not expect him to become my friend or to start treating me with some decency but that was a huge step to a less chaotic bond.Harry disappeared for what felt like an eternity. No one knew what to do or say while he was gone."Lilith" I heard a student from Slytherin calling me. "Your- I mean, Professor Snape wants to talk to you when the task is over."I looked at him confused but nodded anyway.Harry appeared some seconds later and, against almost everyone's belief, grabbed the egg before the Hungarian Horntail could catch him. All the Gryffindors cheered him and shouted happily.After both he and Krum were proclaimed the winners of the task, we all started to abandon the place, and while most of the students were going in the tower's direction, I walked in the professors' direction."Ms Arambella," McGonagall called me. "What are you doing here? These seats are only for the professors and Dumbledore.""Professor Snape wanted to talk to me"She furrowed her eyebrow and looked at me as if I had done something wrong, then sighed."Go."I found Snape grabbing his coat, ready to leave."You wanted to talk to me?" I interrupted him. He gave me a single look and nodded."Yes, come with me, please."I followed him, without any other word, to a little place where all the students had already left."I've talked with Professor Moody.""You have? Or you asked McGonagall to do so?" I reproached him while crossing my arms in front of my chest.He sighed, tired of me."Don't talk to me like that, Lilith. Don't forget who I am.""Yes, my Professor.""I mean your uncle." he corrected me."When you want to.""Don't you know that I'm risking myself and Dumbledore's plans every time I talk to Mad-Eye, do you? I asked Professor McGonagall to talk to him because I knew he would prefer her to do so and she would be calmer when she spoke to him.""Of course, 'cause all you care about is Dumbledore. Do you know how Moody mocked me for that? Do you know how he asked me if I was a coward, and I quote, just like you?"He tightened his lips and clicked his tongue."And not only he insisted me to do the fucking Imperio, but cursed me with it when I refused to." I continued with a cynic tone.Snape's face became paler."So it's true, he cursed you."I nodded."Malfoy asked me about how you were feeling after the curse and I did not know what he was talking about until he explained it to me. He should have never done that.""He thinks I'm a Death Eater. He would do anything against a Death Eater.""Mad-Eye definitely has his eyes on me and Karkaroff, but he shouldn't focus his rage on my relatives. Do not worry, I will make sure he doesn't use any other curse over you.""What are you gonna do, huh? Talk to Dumbledore? Does he care about the other students that are not Potter?""I can't do anything else, Lilith. You are not being fair with me," he complained, whispering."No, you aren't being fair with me, Severus! I've experienced her curse, he forced me to tell the Weasleys how my own mother ordered their relatives' death!""You are acting as if it was my fault. I'm not responsible for what your mother did.""Nor I am, and I've been paying for it since I arrived at this fucking school." I spat almost talking over his words. "Listen, it's been three days since I haven't gone to Moody's class and honestly, I don't want to go back but I know I have to. I don't expect anything else from you, ok? I'll just try to deal with it."I walked away without waiting for any other answer."I'll see you in the Dungeons for the dance training for the Ball." I heard him. He seemed not to be looking forward to it.I thought about not attending the training because I was not really in the mood for it, but then I realised that I would get in trouble with Snape and I really didn't want to piss him off more. It took all my willpower to arrive at the Dungeons, where all the Slytherins were already making a big circle.Snape arrived only one minute after me and walked faster to the middle of the circle.He sighed."Well, you all know why we are here so let's finish it as soon as possible. You have to dance at the Yule Ball and, since the Gryffindors will already have enough protagonism, you will have to try hard."Snape's eyes looked at every single one of us, and without looking at it, he pointed his wand to the gramophone and classical music started to sound."Ms Arambella," he called me looking at his feet. "Would you mind me using you as an example of a dance partner?"I smirked."I would love to, Professor. But I think Draco is more interested in it."Draco, who was still with furrowed eyes looking at his Potter badge, nodded his head."Mr Malfoy, please come," Snape said as if the words were hurting him deeply.Draco stood up and while he was walking in Snape's direction, he stopped."Wait, what did I say 'yes' to?!""You are going to be my dance partner since my lovely niece does not want to be her," Severus replied with sarcasm.The blond boy complained but Snape gave him such a look that made Draco quiet himself quickly and stand right in front of him."Now." he started with an annoying voice. "Hand on my shoulder, Draco.""What?!""Hand on my shoulder," he repeated as he positioned Draco's hand in his old black coat.Everyone tried to hold their laughs but I didn't bother to do so, which gained Snape's judgy eyes over me. I looked back at him, challenging.I was already too tired of Severus never acting as the uncle I needed to even care about what he could say. I was tired of having a family that never actually cared about me and I was definitely exhausted from having everyone abandoning me. I never even considered the chance to become a Death Eater or to get too interested in the Dark Arts but I still had to carry with my mother's crimes. I haven't seen her in three years, but her only name will always crush me. Dumbledore says we all have the opportunity to choose if we want to be good or bad but are they really giving me the choice?

Olivia looked at me with pride in her eyes. After Pauline came to Liv's room to get ready with us, I brought our suitcases where we had our dresses for the Ball. Liv was incredibly nervous even though her date for the Ball was only a friend. Her dress was gorgeous, it was a light blue princess style that was tight in her breasts and waist and accentuated the moles in her arms and collarbones, after one hour of indecision she chose to wear her hair in a high ponytail with two pieces of hair framing her face. Pauline got out of the bathroom already dressed as well. She was wearing a lilac dress, which accentuated her shiny and beautiful dark skin, with a suggestive neckline that adjusted to her waist."Wow, that colour really suits you!" I said looking at her from up to down.She laughed, "Thank you! It's the colour of my house in Beauxbatons, Papillonlisse."Her hair was also braided with beautiful Senegalese twists braids that were decorated with little gold rings in them."But, girl! You look absolutely incredible too! I'm gonna be so envied tonight." she complimented me grabbing my hands to see my dress better.I chose a tight burgundy dress made with an opening in my left leg that almost reached my hip. It exposed the zone of my collarbones and shoulders, giving a lot of attention to them with an accentuated neckline. It was suggestive and sensual, standing out the right parts of my body, but also elegant and comfortable."And we both know by who, right, Livie?" Pauline continued, winking at Liv.I raised one eyebrow looking at them confused."Who are you talking about?""If we tell you it wouldn't be funny," Olivia said with a soft voice."You know? Sometimes I wonder why you aren't in Slytherin, Olivia. You can be a bitch when you want to."She laughed."I learnt from the best." she winked at me."Okay, that was cute. But if you were talking about Cedric you should already know our thing is over. We haven't had sex together in like two years, since he started fancying Chang.""We were not talking about Ced," Olivia answered fixing her make-up with a suspicious smile. "Even though he was one of your last fucks.""Hang on, when was the last time you had sex?" Pauline talked at the same time with a horrified expression."Like a year ago, with a muggle girl...""Are you saying you haven't had sex since your last time with that girl and this guy, Cedric, before? Ce n'est pas possible! ""I've been quite busy and I'm doing well with myself," I replied smiling with confidence. "I have two hands for a reason."A little knock could be heard from outside of Liv's room."Oli, are you ready?" Matthews asked behind the door."In a minute!" she replied putting more gloss on her lips."Are you gonna tell me who you two were talking about?" I asked faking a tired voice.Pauline held her laugh and Olivia grabbed her purse and opened the door. Before leaving with a smiley Matthews, she gave a last mischievous look:"I don't know, ask the nargles.""Sometimes I hate that you are a Lovegood"Pauline intertwined her arm together with mine and smiled at me."Let's go, we need to arrive early or all the white men would rule the dancefloor, and we certainly don't want that."( . . . )The entire room was decorated with silver and white colours that reminded me of winter and Christmas, the curtains were of sateen and the entire salon was full of fountains with food and drinks. They really took their time to decorate this place. I gave a quick look at the people in there and their partners; Draco with Pansy, George Weasley with Spinnet, Nevile with Weasley girl, Fred with Angelina...wow, the girl deserved better.His eyes were focused on her and his brother, he was wearing a black suit with an orange waistcoat while she was wearing a gorgeous purple dress that absolutely suited her.Soon, the competitors arrived. Fleur was followed by Roger Davis, who certainly was not looking as good as her, then Cedric, with a black suit that worked really good for him and that made a little warmth happen in my lower belly, and Cho Chang. Behind, Harry Potter wearing a black suit as well that did not nearly outshine Cedric's, with Parvati Patil who was wearing a beautiful outfit that represented her culture. Finally, Viktor Krum with the incredible Granger. Wow! Who would have guessed? She was looking spectacular with that pink dress and her hair tied up. When she walked near me with her arm intertwined with Krum's, our eyes met and I smiled at her and gave her a little wink. Once again, she blushed."Why are all the women in here looking so gorgeous?" Pauline whispered.Without letting me any time to answer, Liv appeared behind me, with her eyes opened widely."I'm having such a big gay panic," she whispered as well, grabbing my arm and hiding behind me as she put her face against my shoulder."Liv, you are already gay.""I know, and every time I look at Fleur Delacour I know it even better.""Matthews is not looking as good, huh?" I joked."Who's Matthews?" she asked without keeping her eyes away from Fleur.Pauline couldn't hold her laugh."Livie, you should go. 'Your man' is probably looking for you to start the dance." she said with delight full of sarcasm.Liv made a little cute noise complaining and she left, a little bit against her will.Pauline gave me an accomplice look and smile, I gave it back to her as she interlaced her fingers with mine. Soon the lights became fainter and focused on the circle where the four competitors and their partners inaugurated the dance. As we all watched them dance first, my eyes found Weasley's, whose smile became weaker as he noticed me. I could feel how his look covered me up and down and how he raised his eyebrow with an intense bright in his eyes. I didn't take my eyes off him as I moved closer to Pauline and his look travelled to our hands. He smiled again with cynism.When Neville took Ginny to the dancefloor and the rest of the group followed them, Pauline grabbed my waist, and we both, giggling, started to dance as well. We danced together two songs, then I danced with Liv, and then Pauline and Liv started to dance together.I moved to one of the fountains to have a drink and have a little rest. Maybe putting heels on wasn't a very good idea after all. I took a sip of the glass, champagne with no alcohol? Nah, we could do better than that. I took my wand out of one of the openings in my dress and made a little spell I learnt from Snape's book that put alcohol into any drink, I sipped again and yes, it was much better."Arambella, can you move? I'm trying to get a drink." Sienna's voice said beside me. She was wearing a tight light pink dress that marked her body."Good evening, Plums. You're looking good."She looked at me furrowing her eyebrows and giving me an up-to-down look."Yeah, what a shame I can't say the same for you.""Then do like I do, darling," I replied faking a smile. "Lie."She walked away angry, making her heels sound a bit too much. I wasn't lying when I said she was indeed looking good, but she decided to be a rude bitch, as usual, so I was not going to let her win this round."Did your partner already abandon you?" I heard a little mumble coming from a low voice.I looked to my left and there he was, recovering his cocky smile; Fred Weasley."She didn't. Not like yours, as I see.""She's dancing with a friend.""So is Lin.""Oh, now her name's Lin? I see..." he smiled even wider."What do you want, Weasley?" I sighed, tired, without looking directly at him."To bother you, obviously," he said proudly.I rolled my eyes and clicked my tongue."You know? I saw you earlier blushing when you saw Diggory entering the room with Cho." he continued."In your dreams, maybe. Do I at least look cute in them?"He positioned his hand on the table behind me, very near to my lower back, making his body lean a little bit closer to me."Nah, you look terrible. And I'm not sorry to be the one telling you this, I actually enjoy it, but you know Diggory will never look at you like that, right?"I held my laugh putting the glass against my lips."Because he has a girlfriend?""Because it's you." he corrected me. "It would be like shagging Professor Snape.""That's how you passed Potions, by shagging my uncle?""Nah, I bet your uncle is a 40-year-old virgin. Wouldn't hook up with him even for all the gold in the world.""Oh, no, are you following his path?" I faked being concerned for him."Not even close." he bragged."Pack it up, shaggy." I ironized. "Poor person...I hope they discovered what good sex is after that disastrous performance I bet you did."He burst into laughter."Oh, dear, believe me, I wouldn't even touch you with a stick but if I fucked you, you wouldn't have that bitchy face," he murmured while his pupils grew in his eyes."Yeah, no, thank you, but I prefer having a bitchy face that not coming during sex," I replied imitating his tone. I put one hand on the table, leaning my body a little bit against it while one of my legs was completely out of the dress opening and I grabbed with the other hand a strawberry from the fountain. Keeping my sight into the dancefloor, where I quickly saw Draco having the time of his life while he was dancing, and noticing Weasley's eyes still over me, I took the strawberry to my lips and bite it slowly out of its leaves."I would say 'don't knock it until you've tried' but again, I wouldn't touch even if you begged me.""You can dream about me begging you about anything, that's the only place where it would happen.""Here you are, Lilith! I lost you while I was talking with Fleur." I heard Pauline's voice behind me. "Hello, Fred.""Hi, gorgeous," Fred replied getting flirty.I gave him a disgusted look, I think I might vomit."Do you want to dance next song?" she asked me with a smile. "Or are you dancing with him?" she changed her tone to a surprised one."Hell no!" Fred and I answered at the same time."Great, let's go then." Pauline grabbed my hand and was about to take me to the dancefloor when she stopped, looking at my lips. "Wait, you have a little bit of strawberry juice." she cleaned it with her thumb and then took it to her mouth. "Ready," she said and then gave me a quick kiss on my lips that I replied naturally. Fred's brows raised at the same time with his eyes still on the two of us, but we ignored him and walked straight to the dancefloor.Pauline smiled at me and when a slow song started playing, she put her hands on my waist, making us being closer to each other."May I ask what was that kiss for?" I asked looking above her shoulder."Oh, I'm sorry, did it bother you?" Pauline replied genuinely concerned."No! Not at all, I just didn't expect it.""Well, Weasley was giving you a very interesting look so I thought I could make things even better so he could be jealous.""Yeah, I bet he wants to be me right now." I smiled proudly."Mhm, he's still looking at you," she said with a tone I couldn't decipher, as she looked above my shoulder."Is he?" I asked confused."Well, more like eating you with his eyes.""What? Nah, bet he's looking at you, girl.""Whatever you say, babe," she sounded sarcastic, making me smile."I bet he's drunk."We made a little spin while dancing and I ended being in Pauline's position so my eyes met Fred's again. He had a glass on his left hand and was comfortably and arrogantly leaning against the table as he kept his eyes on me with that mischievous and fierce look.I felt how a little fire settled in my stomach and suddenly, I felt every single inch in my skin. His eyes were burning me, and I don't know if it was because of my loss of habit to alcohol, but I didn't dislike it that much.The song ended and I smiled at Pauline again."Wait," she suddenly said, looking across the room. "I'm gonna found Livie, it's been a while since I've seen her."I was about to follow her but my eyes went back on Fred and the fire in my lower stomach became pure ice. He was intensely making out with Sienna Plums. Ew.I tried to find Pauline again, but she was already lost.Alright, then I don't have any other option, time to get wasted.

I was in my fifth - maybe sixth - drink when all the Professors left the Ball. I think I remember Snape telling me to be careful with the drinks...Liv, who was pretty much as waisted as me, was only moving the skirt of her dress from one side to another, like a little girl, when she saw me and a huge smile grew on her face."Hey, Lilith," she said with a voice a little bit too loud and a strong Irish accent. "Wanna dance next song? I'm a bit hammered and Matthews's already left."Her cheeks were redder than usual, her pupils became bigger and her hair was a little bit messy."Yeah, sure!" I said and it took less her than a minute to drag me to the dancefloor.Like a Virgin from the Muggle singer Madonna, who I knew for a fact that Olivia loved, started playing. Her hands were touching around my waist and mine were on her neck, our hips were softly hitting each other as we danced together, with our legs intertwined while we smiled. We were almost the same height so it was very easy for us to dance like that. Also, last year, when we could spend the whole summer together, we got the habit of scaping to Muggle parties where we perfectionated our dancing skills.I don't know why, but my eyes moved from Liv and went again to the corner where half an hour ago I saw Weasley making out with Sienna Plums. He was still there but alone.Fred took off his jacket and his waistcoat, staying in his white shirt which was kinda unbuttoned, giving a little view of his chest. He was leaning against the table with his arms and legs crossed, looking arrogantly attractive, his lips were making a scornful smile and his eyebrows were raised like if he was surprised. And his eyes, oh Merlin, I felt his eyes burning me up to down, I could feel them in every corner of my skin that was in his sight. Liv's hands went from my waist to my hips and when I looked at her she had her eyes on Weasley as well. She went back on me and winked. I was so drunk that I couldn't even form a word so I just looked back to Fred.My little entertainment got over when Plums arrived again and offered Fred one of the two drinks she had in her hands. It took them less than two minutes to finish them, Fred's eyes still on me. What the fuck was he looking for?After patiently putting both empty drinks on the table, Fred grabbed Sienna by her waist with one hand while the other was in the back of her neck to put her entire body against his. He bit his lip and then kissed her in the most sinful and wild way possible. A little fire burnt me in the deepest part of my body as I saw how his lips were moving against Plums's, it looked like they were fucking each other only with their mouths. His hand travelled from her waist to her hips, where he squeezed a little bit and moved to her bum to give her a little slap, then lifted her leg, so it was around his hip, and caressed her naked thigh.My mouth got dryer and a huge tingle appeared between my thighs, the air in the room got heavier and I found it difficult to breathe. I felt every single inch of my skin crave for a touch like that and the blood burning in my veins. Fuck, he definitely knew how to kiss.The song changed to another one and I hadn't even noticed that Pauline joined us again when I felt a pair of bigger hands on my waist. I turned around and Cedric was giving me a big smile."Lith! How's the night going?" he said in my ear because of how loud was the music.I swallowed hard trying to avoid the previous situation and trying to ignore the little devilish part of my consciousness that wanted to fuck Cedric so I could forget the huge urge I had to fuck him.Nah, I didn't actually want to fuck him. As Pauline said, I've been too long without sex."Very well! Fancy a drink?" I replied struggling with words because of the alcohol."Nah, I'm good. And you should slow down a bit, mate." he chuckled."Don't tell me what to do, Diggory." I threatened him joking. " Where's Chang?""She was too tired, I took her to the Ravenclaw common room.""She was looking very good today.""So do you, I think I've never seen you so glamorous.""Yes, 'cause the only clothes you have seen me with are the ones from the uniform.""And the lingerie..." he whispered even lower."You still remember that, huh?""How could I forget?" he winked. I smiled back at him. Merlin, if he was single...I couldn't remember what the next minutes were about, but I had a little flashback of dancing with Draco as the whole Slytherin house was hyping us, making a circle around us.Minutes later, I took my heels off and drank two glasses more. The next day was a Saturday so, who cared? Well, maybe it was a Sunday? I didn't know anymore...I was picking up another strawberry when another pair of warm hands touched me in the space between my waist and my hips and I noticed a big body moving behind me to get to the part of the table where the drinks were. I thought it was Cedric again but the way my skin reacted told me that it wasn't him. When I looked back, I found Fred Weasley."Why are you touching me?" I spat trying not to stutter but to sound mean."Because you don't move out of the way." he simply said drinking his glass in just one sit."Don't do it again.""You wish me to." he chuckled once, giving me again that up-to-down look and taking one of the strawberries to put it all inside his mouth and bite it slowly, keeping eye contact with me. The same previous heat appeared between my legs. Damn it, I should stop drinking."Not even in your dreams," I mumbled, giving him a sarcastic smile.I walked away without waiting for his answer and saw Pauline and Liv dancing together. I stumbled a little bit with my own feet as I approached them, but kept walking."Girls, I can't handle it anymore. I'm going to my room.""To fuck W-?" Liv started asking but Pauline quickly covered her mouth with her hands."She means to sleep already? It's still early," she said instead.I was too tired and drunk to even bother about what Liv wanted to say, so I just simply nodded, gave both a kiss on their cheeks and walked away. At the hall, I saw some students vomiting in the shrubs, others making out and others being carried by their friends to their rooms.Draco was in this last group, being carried by Crabbe and Goyle while he mumbled something about 'daddy' and 'Potter'.I got to the Slytherin common room stumbling and walking in zig zags, and it took me a while to climb the stairs to my dorm. When I finally got there, I put the lock at the door and cast a Muffliato so no one out of there could bother me. The weak light of the moon was the only illumination in my room.I threw my heels and the diadem to one of the corners, and then took off my dress and my bra. Then, I literally threw myself to my bed and ended up lying facing the ceiling. After trying in vain to fall asleep I got to the conclusion that I could not ignore the tingles and heat coming from certain part of my body.I complained out loud growling because I knew who was the damn responsible for that.Obeying the attention my body was craving, I took off my black knickers and with a soft caress all over my abdomen and hips, I spread my legs noticing immediately the wetness growing. Bitting my lip while one of my hands was over my breast, I moved the other hand to the place where the wetness was coming from. The first touch made me tremble and every inch of my skin claimed attention. As I moved my fingers over my clit a very clear image came to my mind; Fred Weasley looking at me as he did before, kissing me as he did with Plums. A hoarse moan came out of my mouth and when I moved my fingers down to please the hunger in my body, my mind travelled even more; Fred was there, leaning to my body, with his eyes fixed to mine biting my lip as he smiled, proud of being him the one that gave me so much pleasure. My fingers weren't any longer mine, they were his and the way I imagined him moaning my name in my ear with his deep voice made me groan even louder and have chills covering my body. As I kept touching myself, taking me almost to the limit, I could see him kissing my neck in a way as sinful as his kisses while his hand was still moving in my vagina and I had him moaning.The contrast between the cold in the room and the warmth coming out from me excited me even more to the point that I imagined what would feel like to have Weasley inside of me, making our hips collapse together because of how hard he was going, tightening my inner walls around my own soaked fingers, thinking it was Fred's dick. I could almost hear him growl of pure pleasure and I felt myself over the cliff of a huge amazing orgasm. Rushing my fingers faster and softly squeezing my breast with my other hand, I came hard, imagining Fred giving the last hard impacts and coming as well, inside of me, with a loud and deep moan that he tried to drown in my neck.I opened my eyes and found nothing more than the ceiling and the window with the moonlight passing through the lake's water. The cold invaded my naked skin as I tried to normalize my breath. Wow, that was good. I chuckled knowing damn well tomorrow I would be complaining and wanting to throw myself out of a window because I masturbated thinking about Fred Weasley, but that was a problem for future me to care about.Finally pleased, naked and still drunk I fell asleep, hugging one of my pillows.The next day, when I woke up with a terrible headache, it was already midday.Ugh, I should never drink again.I went to my bathroom to get rid of the last trails of alcohol in my system, and when I got out I cleaned my room, having little flashbacks of the previous night.Liv being gay for Fleur, Pauline and me dancing, Weasley being a dick, as usual, me drinking, Weasley kissing Plums, me dancing with Liv...oh, shit.The flashback of what I did once I got to my bed hit me like a truck and I felt the blood abandoning my body.WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO?!

I tried to avoid going out for the rest of the day, but at one point, I couldn't ignore how hungry I was. Coming out of my dorm, I found Draco sitting downstairs with his head between his knees."You alright, mate?" I asked him, putting my hand over his shoulder, with the most hoarse voice ever."Ugh, I'm never drinking again," he mumbled. "I feel like shit.""That's what we all say. Welcome to the club.""You know what's the worst part? I dreamt of Potter. Not even in my drunk dreams the fucker leaves me alone."I couldn't help but chuckle and after giving him a little hug. I went out to the corridor where every student from Year 4 and up, was having a huge headache and was dealing with the havocs of the previous night. My eyes found Liv and Pauline pretty quickly, they were leaned against one of the walls, talking, and they seemed very gaunt."Morning," I said as I got closer to them, hugging myself because of how cold it was."More like 'evening', girl," Pauline said with a voice almost as hoarse as mine. "You finally came from the dead.""Ugh, don't even mention it. I can't believe a human body can take that much alcohol.""Well, you haven't been the worst. After you left, Livie and I kept drinking.""Liv, how you doing?""Dead on the inside," she replied, giving a sip to her water bottle. "I can't remember anything since midnight. Lin has been telling me how I got to my room.""Yeah, it doesn't matter how drunk I am, I can remember everything that happened." Pauline intervened."What a blessing. Or a curse. I don't know anymore.""By the way, have you heard the last news? I was walking to the Hall when I heard this girl from Gryffindor, I think that's the name of the red house, talking about it." Pauline said, lowering her voice. "I was asking Livie about it but she lives in her own world, you know."Liv didn't even bother to replied to that, she just kept drinking from her water bottle."Apparently, Fred Weasley and Sienna Plums spent the night together."My body got chills when that name was mentioned. Shit, I was already forgetting it."I mean, are any of you really surprised? Because I am not. They are meant for each other." I said trying to sound like I didn't care."You don't care?" Liv asked me, genuinely concerned."Why would I?""Your two enemies are bonding together."In the exact moment when that phrase left her mouth, the hall's door was opened and there he was. He looked pretty haggard and his eyes had black circles below them, his hair was a bit messy and he moved quite slow. Fred approached a group of Gryffindors that were in front of us, in the other part of the corridor. As soon as I saw him, I felt how my heart raced. Bloody hell, why I couldn't forget that?His eyes met mine for a moment and a little red tone covered his cheeks as well. Is he blushing? He took off his look away from me pretty fast and kept talking with his mates, but he wasn't acting as natural as usual.At some point, Plums arrived by the other side of the corridor, gave Fred a weird angry gaze and went to the other corner of the room, followed by some of her friends. Fred looked at her with indifference."Oi, Weasley! What happened with Sienna? She seems kinda pissed off, mate! Did she think she was going to become your girlfriend because you shagged her?" a boy from Gryffindor, Marco Alton, joked.Ew, men's humour."What happened between Sienna and me it's none of your business. It's not like I have to give any explanation but let's leave it like we didn't have that much chemistry so I preferred to stay just as friends.""Are you saying you let pass the opportunity to fuck that bimbo?" the boy asked again with his eyebrows raised what gained Fred's narrowed eyes."How can men be so repulsive?" Pauline said out loud, gaining some of the attention from that group."What can you expect from them?" I said leaning against the wall.Fred put his eyes on me again."Shut up, Arambella. The last thing I need now is you talking shit."I thought I didn't say it that loud but apparently, I did it enough for him to hear me. I tried not to look nervous again as he kept looking at me."Then leave, Weasley. I'm in the middle of a hangover, your presence isn't something I want at the moment."George Weasley arrived at the exact moment, looking as tired as his brother.Fred walked in my direction and stood up in the middle of the corridor."Yeah, I bet you would prefer Malfoy," he said in a little mumble that apparently only the girls and I heard. " Or Diggory, perhaps.""Oh, shut up.""You know? I thought you were an arrogant bitch with too much self-esteem but after seeing that you don't mind being Diggory's second option, I'm not that sure anymore." he continued, with a deep voice.Oh no, that's it. I walked in his direction and ended up being so close to him that he had to look down at me."You don't have a clue what you are saying. Maybe it's because you haven't even been an option but I can guarantee you I'm nobody's second one. Cedric is just my friend and yes, I would totally prefer him right now." I replied using the same tone as him."Oh, yes, I saw how you were being friends last night," he said ironically. "Don't you understand? The only reason he's friends with you is that he wants to fuck you, that's the only way you could have someone like him approaching you. I'm really sorry for his lack of taste though, Cho is way better.""As if I cared. And don't think you are better than me, Weasley. The only person that would be with you is someone as bitchy as Plums. Shame that you let her go, maybe that was your last chance to have a partner who matches you. Now, since you are clearly not Cedric, I gotta go. Have better things to do than argue with you like little children."His eyes shined with pure anger but his face kept that arrogant and calm smile. I turned around and found Pauline, Liv and George sharing a pack of popcorn. Those bitches were enjoying the show."Have you two finished?" George said taking the popcorn to his mouth. "Because I'm hungry, Fred.""Let's go, George. I had enough of Slytherin bullshit for today." his brother replied, already walking away."Thank you for the popcorn, it was really proper for such a show," George said to Liv and Pauline, who laughed and waved at him. "Bye, girls!"I walked back to them."Can you believe it? How can someone be such an idiot?""The main-character complex," Pauline said reaching the last amount of popcorn in the bag. "You want some?""No, thanks." I was so pissed off with Weasley that all my hunger vanished."Off-topic but, Lilith are you ready for tomorrow's class with Moody? You can't keep avoiding him if you want to have a good grade in his class.""Oh, shit, I didn't even remember it. Maybe I should go to the library to give a little look at it. Also, the silence in there will be so good for my headache."I gave them a big hug and left back to my common room to get my DADA books and notes.When I arrived at the library, it was almost empty, as usual. I sat at one of the most hidden tables and quickly immersed myself in the books. I don't know if it was because of how much I enjoyed the subject with Professor Lupin or if it was a Slytherin thing, but it was pretty easy for me to catch the rhythm of the class again, the topics they were on at the moment was something I already investigated before by my own.I was completing some notes when I noticed a tall figure in front of me. When I lifted my eyes I found a nervous Neville Longbottom staring at the table."Hello, Lilith," he said stuttering a bit. "Do you mind if I sit with you?"I smiled kindly at him."Of course, Neville. I'm catching up with some DADA stuff, what about you?""Potions, again." he sighed. "Professor Snape is going to fail me if I don't get any better.""Maybe I can help."His eyes shined with pure relief and he showed me his notes. I couldn't give him my notebook since I only brought the DADA one but I still helped him. Half an hour later, we both were concentrated on our homework."I've finished for today," I said stretching out. I was too tired to even think about good manners."Me too," he said closing proudly his notebook. "You don't have to answer me this if you don't want to but - how can you be doing bad in DADA? I remember when last year Professor Lupin was bragging in front of the Slytherins from my course about how different and keen some of the Slytherins of your course were, he mentioned a bunch of names that were on top of the class and yours was in that list.""Did he?" I said surprised. "Well, DADA with Professor Lupin was definitely my favourite subject, the only thing I didn't like was that I had to share it with the bloody Gryffindors -"I interrupted myself when the fact that Neville was a Gryffindor himself hit me"I'm sorry," I said in a low voice."It doesn't matter, I'm a Gryffindor but they aren't too kind to me.""I'm really sorry. They are shit with me too, and now that Professor Moody has his eyes on me, they are making DADA a fucking hell.""Why?""Because he keeps thinking I'm just like my mother. He wants me to do her curses and I'm one hundred per cent sure he thinks I would be a Death Eater if I could." I sighed hardly. "I haven't given him any reason to think so but he reckons I'm the biggest evil in the world.""But you are not responsible for what your mother did!" he replied pretty concernedly. "I've been watching you and you are very kind, you have few friends and quite a temper but you are far away from being like your mother or your un-" he stopped himself."Say it, like my uncle, right?" I completed and he nodded. "Yeah, well, say that to Mad-Eye. I didn't want to talk to Snape about it because it would only feed the rumour that I take advantage of being his niece, but it got to a point that it was me talking to Snape or cursing Mad-Eye." I said, leaning in my chair and looking at the ceiling. "Anyway, it didn't work. Snape's only worry is to please Dumbledore. I'm alone in this.""I'm really sorry, you don't deserve that. Professor Moody is kinda complicated. He made me perform the Cruciatus curse over a spider and I don't have a good relationship with that curse."I knew about what Bellatrix Lestrange and Barty Crouch Jr. did to Neville's parents before being in Azkaban, but since it was something so personal and painful, I decided not to say anything about it."And Snape isn't doing any better to you, is he?""He hates me! I try hard in all of his classes but he hates me!" the poor boy complained."He's also very complicated. I've been all my life near him and still don't understand how his mind works. I used to be kinda bonded to him when I was a kid, he was the one who used to take me to Azkaban to see my mother, but the pass of the time and me entering teenage made our relationship colder and very distant.""We both are pretty fucked, aren't we?" he said, surprising me for hearing him using a curse word."Yes, we are, mate."After another couple of minutes, we decided to pick up our stuff and get out of the library. It was already sunset and we were pretty tired. We kept talking about how bad was it going for us and I got to the conclusion that we weren't that different when I noticed that I was walking beside him I was already at the Gryffindor common room's entrance. My first time there."Thank you so much for your company, Lilith." Neville smiled. "It was lovely.""Thank you, Nev. Hope I can see you again soon. And remember, if you ever need help with my unbearable uncle, you can count on me.""I will," he replied with a bigger smile. While I was about to walk away, he took out of his pocket a little piece of paper and stood in front of the painting. Since I didn't care at all about what the Gryffindor password was, I simply turned around."What the fuck are you doing here?" I heard someone say in front of me. I lifted my eyes and Fred Weasley was there, looking at me with furrowed eyebrows and crossed arms over his chest."None of your business." I simply said, walking away.Instead of going back to my common room, I went to Liv's room where I spent the night since I wasn't feeling in the mood to sleep alone.If only all the Gryffindors were like Neville...

The next day, classes kept going as usual, even though I was deadly scared about Defence Against the Dark Arts. Surprisingly, Moody didn't even look at me once or refer to me. He talked about the merpeople since it had to do with the Tournament's next task, and ordered us to do some research about it on our own.Everybody, especially the Gryffindors, seemed pretty altered during the class probably fearing that Moody could make any of his hideous comments, but the entire hour went by pretty normal and calmed. I can almost say it was a bearable class.When I got out, I found Olivia waiting next to the door and I greeted her. She asked me about how the class went and showed her surprise when I told her Moody's attitude. I asked about Pauline, she had been so busy lately with all her exams and lots of homework that she couldn't hang out with us as much as we wanted. Once we arrived at the Hall, we had to go each to her house table and I sat next to Draco, who smiled at me when he saw me, once I pictured him."Hey, Lovegood!"My eyes quickly lifted from my food when I heard one of the boys from Ravenclaw talking. He was looking straight to Liv."Can you tell the pathetic of your sister to stop bothering us in the common room with her stupid invented creatures? Some of us have real work to do and a good reputation to keep to Ravenclaw. We can't be seen talking with her."Olivia frowned her eyebrows and did a disgusted face."I don't care if you mess with me but messing with my little sister while she's not even here isn't very kind of you.""I'm not messing with her, I'm just telling the truth. Maybe instead of sorting her in Ravenclaw, they should have sent her to St Mungo's.""Can't you just leave Luna alone?" she replied turning around and focusing on her food. The rest of the people at her table were giving her comforting looks."And what are you going to do, huh? You are the least useful Lovegood, at least your father and sister are nuts enough to have some protagonism, but you? You are only the badger's bitch."Watching how Olivia lowered her head next to those words and how that son of a bitch and his friends started laughing, I couldn't help but get up with my wand in my hand ready."Lilith, where are you going?" I heard Draco say behind me.With my mind numb of pure anger, I don't even know how I got so fast in front of him with my wand against his neck. I was tired as fuck of watching those bitches messing with the Lovegoods for no fucking reason. The boy looked at me with surprise and disdain, quite scared and embarrassed since almost all the students from the older years of the four houses were watching us."Say that again, you son of a bitch." I dared him in a mumble."This is not your problem, little Snape.""Say it again! Aren't you so brave and such a witty head? Or is it just that you are so fucking scared of having someone finally confronting you?"I pushed my wand deeper into his skin and he started to breathe more heavily."You are a coward, you mess with Olivia and Luna because you know they are too good to respond to you back, but guess what? Tough luck, my guy, 'cause I'm not half as good so if you bother any of them again, be sure I'm going to make your life impossible."He smiled arrogantly, which reminded me of Weasley and made my anger grew even more."Now you have Snape's bitch to hold your back, Lovegood. How embarrassing is it to know that you can only defend yourself by having a Slytherin by your side?" he gave a few steps back and before starting to walk away, he gave us a last look. "My best regards to your mothers, girls. Hope you follow their paths."This time I couldn't hold it. In a millisecond, I lifted my wand and pointed at his back."SECTUMSEM-!""NO!" Olivia caught my wand before I could finish the curse. Her eyes were tearful and her cheeks were out of colour. "Don't do it, Lilith. We are lucky all the professors are gone but he would tell them and you'd be punished, he is not worthy. It doesn't matter.""No, Liv. It does matter!" I replied. "I'm sick of hearing those scumbags insulting you. You are like a sister to me. And if any of you has any trouble with Olivia Lovegood or her sister again, you can come directly to me!" I shouted staring at every single one in the room. "Maybe you want me to practice some curses."I went back to my table under the look of both Slytherins and Gryffindors. Draco, Blaise and Pansy were looking at me with a proud smile while most of the Gryffs had an annoying face and a surprised look."That was impressive," Draco said in a low voice. My eyes went back to Liv who was being hugged by some of the people of her house. After a while, I saw Cedric entering the Hall and going straight to Liv with his characteristic smile face, but once he saw how Liv was looking, his smile vanished and he seemed pretty worried about her. They both stood up together and walked away from the Hall, as soon as I saw them almost at the door, I stood up as well following them.I was about to open the door when a tall figure put itself on the way.Fred Weasley."What was all that for?" he asked actually confused."Why do you care?" I replied with the driest tone possible. Trying to move away from him."Because you have never tried to curse anyone, not even me. Does that Lovegood girl matter that much to you?" he said blocking my way out again.I sighed, exasperate."She does, Weasley. She's my best friend.""You have friends?""I do! Now, can you move or do I have to move you myself?""Wow! Calm down, beast. Don't think that because you are in this 'righteous roll' I'm gonna be scared of you.""Weasley, I don't have time for you right now and I couldn't care less if you are scared of me or not. MOVE OR I'LL MOVE YOU!"He didn't say any other word but smiled cockily and gave two steps back, showing the door open. I did not wait any longer, I truly didn't have time for Fred right now and the less I see him or think about him, the less I would remember my little accident.Since there was no trace of Liv nor Cedric, I went straight to the entrance of the Hufflepuff common room. I looked at the barrels but I was too nervous and still angry to remember which one of them I had to hit and I didn't want to end up covered in vinegar."Fucking hell, I'm such a useless idiot!" I whispered as I stamped a little rock on the floor.I was desperate because I knew damn well how Olivia feels whenever she's sad and it pained me to think that it wasn't me the one consoling her.C'mon, Lilith, think. Was it the first line or the third? And which barrel?Surprisingly, the door opened and Cedric appeared behind it."Olivia told me that you were probably out here cursing because you couldn't enter the common room," he said with a soft voice."I was, how is she?" I quickly walked towards him."She tried to keep it together in the Hall, but once she got to her dorm she started crying in my arms. I think it hurts her more whenever they mess with Luna than when they mess with her.""I'm so fucking tired of them.""She told me you almost cursed him, I wish I was there. At least, I could have defended Olivia."Without any other word, he moved from the door to let me in. I knew the exact way to Liv's room and, before even thinking about knocking on the door, I entered and found her sitting in her bed, with her legs crossed and tissue between her hands.She looked at me and her face was covered in tears."Liv..." I whispered. I felt Cedric behind me, and knowing that Liv probably will be more comfortable alone, I asked him as kindly as I could. "Ced, can you give us a moment please?"He nodded and gave me a little pat on my shoulder, while he looked at Liv with his lips tightened.Once he left, I went straight to Olivia's bed and hugged her tightly."I'm really sorry, sister." I started in a soft mumble. "You don't deserve this, you shouldn't have stopped me from cursing him""No, Lilith. The Sectumsempra curse is a reason for being expelled, I don't want you to be punished because of me.""I couldn't care less about it. What he said to you, about your mother, was terrible...and the way he referred to you...""He did mention your mother too. But you are not as affected as I am, he's right. I'm just a crybaby and the less useful Lovegood." she said in a whisper, still against my body."No, Liv, you are not any of those things. And yes, he did mention my mother but Circe Snape deserves all the hate she gets and honestly, I'm used to it. You know I never had any relationship with her besides her manipulative and dark obsession with me, even though she is still alive. While you - you loved your mother, Liv. You are just like her, you were her weakness. You are in your full right to be as affected as you want.""I feel like I'm weak." she sobbed. "I know I'm a failure. To my family, to my heritage and I'm not that sure about being my mum's soft spot. She thought she raised a strong woman and look at me, I'm just the opposite. I'm only a complete disappointment."The tears hit me in the back of my eyes. Olivia wasn't the kind of person to speak about her emotions, she would always rather being the one consoling and listening to others talking about theirs', but I always knew that the comments Ravenclaws did, hurt her deeply. I felt like such a horrible friend just to think about how selfish I had been and how I didn't defend her first."You are no disappointment, Olivia. Do you hear me? You are the strongest woman I've ever met and I'm sure Pandora Lovegood would be incredibly proud of you if she could see you."Liv sobbed even harder."Olivia, I would be nothing without you. You are my best friend, my sister, my family. If it wasn't for you I don't even know where I would be. You are one of the few reasons this school is not the worst place in the world."She hugged me with more strength."I love you, Liv. And no matter what happens, you will always have me and Luna by your side."I went out of her dorm for a few seconds to grab her a hot chocolate and a couple of blankets from the cupboards in the common room. We stayed there together for an entire hour, drinking chocolate and avoiding the topic. While I was telling her how Weasley stopped me before coming to her dorm, a little knock could be heard from outside."Livie? Are you still there?" I heard Luna Lovegood's soft voice."Come in, Luna," Olivia said with her voice still a bit hoarse.Luna opened the door with a worried face. She was wearing her Ravenclaw uniform and around her neck, her famous necklace made with butterbeer corks.She sat beside her sister and hugged her tightly.I explained to her what happened in the Hall while Liv kept drinking her chocolate. Once I finished, Luna still kept her undecipherable look but seemed kinda sad.We decided to lay down in Liv's bed. Just the three of us as we used to do during summers at the Lovegood's house. Listening to music, reading muggle novels and drinking hot chocolate.When it was already almost night, I tried to offer myself to sleep with Liv so she wasn't alone but Luna offered herself first so I let them by themselves. Even though I knew Olivia considered me her sister as much as she considered Luna, today's situation was about the two of them.Going back to the Slytherin common room, I couldn't help but think about how always the good and innocent people, like Liv or Neville, are the ones having to deal with others' mockery and scorn without any reason. What led me to think, were they actually better than me just because their families weren't Death Eaters?

"I'm fucking exhausted," the girl claimed as she leaned her head over her bent knees. Pauline looked more tired than ever before. Dark circles were formed under her eyes, her hair was a bit messy and her voice sounded pretty much without energy."Exams?""Yeah, and all the madness going around the school. Everyone is trying to keep up with our homework while we support Fleur, who by the way, is incredibly nervous."We were chatting in the garden, enjoying one of the few free hours we had, I was leaned against a tree while Olivia was comfortably laid down with her head over my lap. The winter cold atmosphere from February and Scotland's cloudy weather didn't stop us from having a little break in the outside air. After Liv's little breakdown a week ago, we told Pauline about everything and she quickly offered herself to defend both Liv and Luna in case those pricks from Ravenclaw dared to come back again at them. Actually, she seemed even as mad as I was, which surprised me since she only met us four months ago."Lilith, can I talk to you for a moment?" I heard a soft stuttering male voice behind the tree. Neville Longbottom was looking at his feet with a big herbology book in his hand."Yeah, sure!" I said, standing up a bit confused since he never approached me in public. I saw his intentions of wanting to speak alone so I got my bag and waved at the girls who gave me a simultaneously confused look. Once we were a little bit away from all the crowd, I asked him, "well, how can I help you?""I suppose you already know what the new task is about, and Harry has been trying to find a way to breathe underwater but nothing seems to work." his voice started to falter and I saw how he swallowed hard. " I-I was reading yesterday the book Professor Moody let me and I found something that might help, but the nearest place where I can find it is in y-your uncle's o-office," he said with such a shy and scared voice."And you want me to let you in?" I asked raising my left eyebrow.He nodded."You know I could be helping Cedric rather than Potter, don't you?"He looked a bit disappointed, "Yeah, sure, I should have supposed it. I'm really sorry for bothering you." he said and started to walk away."Neville, I never said I'm not going to help you." I stopped him. "I'm not Potter's number one fan but if you ask me to help you, I'll do it. Especially because I know Snape wouldn't give it to you."His eyes shined with pure relief and he couldn't hold his smile back."Come on, I know for a fact that now he has classes at the Dungeons with the Third Year kids. If we go now, you can keep them until tomorrow and give them to Harry." I started walking in Severus' office direction. I couldn't believe I was going to sneak into his office, but honestly, it wasn't exactly the first time I did it. Neville seemed pretty nervous and was looking around him all the time as if he was afraid of someone noticing us."You do know that you don't have to be scared, right?" I talked with normality. " All the Professors know I have the entrance allowed into Snape's place anytime I want. They won't say anything to us."The Longbottom boy looked at me with his eyes open widely."Are you saying that you have free access to everything in his office?""No, I'm saying that I can enter his office whenever I want, that doesn't mean he wouldn't tell me off if he knew I took something from him."We got to the door where a huge lock blocked the entrance. Neville looked at me worried."How are we going to open it? I bet it's not as easy as an Alohomora.""Oh, don't worry, it's even easier than that," I smirked. Neville was right, the door wouldn't open with a charm, but I knew better. I lifted my leg and gave a hard kick to the lock which quickly opened itself and broke into the floor. I pushed the door under Neville's surprised look. "Now, go get what you need. But do it faster."He nodded and it took him less than five minutes to look into the bottles Severus had on his shelves and find what he needed." Gillyweed?" I asked once I saw the little herb in his hands. "You are a fucking genius, mate."He simply chuckled and stood back as I picked the lock from the floor and put it back in the door. With a simple Reparo, the lock seemed impeccable, as if we never been there."Wow," Neville sighed as we came back to the students' corridor. "That was quite an adventure!"I burst into laughter.( . . . )"Somebody, please, give me an apple juice." Draco dramatically announced, sitting in the place by my side. Crabbe and Goyle stood up fast from the Slytherin table and in less than a minute, handled Draco his juice. They were a bit like his servants."What's going on, buddy?" I asked him, observing his tired face."Today's the second task of this bloody Tournament." he spat getting the little straw from its plastic."And you are frustrated because Harry will have more protagonism than you?" I guessed gaining a little groan as his complaint. I snickered and hugged him grabbing his arm and resting my head on his shoulder. Draco really provoked a huge feeling of tenderness and affection, he was almost like a little brother to me.I was listening to Draco chatting with Blaise when Madam Hotch opened the Hall door approaching the space between Slytherin and Gryffindor's tables."Quidditch players, even though this year we won't have the competition between the four houses, next year we will definitely continue with it. That's why I asked Professor Dumbledore to let me borrow one of your free hours to let you practise and train so you keep in shape."I sighed in relief. Since the Triwizard Tournament started, I hadn't had time to play Quidditch and I deeply needed to free myself from all the stress. All the players stood up quickly when Hotch stopped talking."However, the competitors of the Tournament, can't practice today. They have to prepare themselves for the task so I will thank you if you stay in the Hall gaining proteins and strength. The rest of you can follow me to the field!" she continued.Everybody started walking away from the Hall but before leaving I noticed Cedric's sad face on the Hufflepuff table as he looked to all the group leaving, I bet he also wanted to free some stress. I quickly got beside him."Cheer up, mate! You're gonna be the next champion." I told him, making him smile. I gave him an affectionate punch in his arm and left him talking to Liv and Pauline who since a few days ago, started to join frequently the Hufflepuff table.Once we all arrived at the field, we all formed a big circle around Hotch."Okay, children. I'm going to divide the field into two sections and I will sort you all into four groups, this will teach you how to work with other players you aren't familiar with and how to make more versatile play techniques. Give me five minutes to get the balls and we will start."When she started walking away, I got closer to Draco. We were calmly talking when I heard the most familiar voice from Gryffindor."What's up, Arambella? Are you going back to Malfoy now that Diggory is too busy for you?" Fred Weasley teased, walking from the other side of the circle to get to the rest of the Gryffindor's group.Draco seethed and shook his head."Weasleys..." he said in a little whisper.I smiled cynic at Fred. Surprisingly, the rest of his group and the other teams were too focused on themselves to care about us three."Don't you have anything else to do other than bothering me?""Actually no, I'm bored and you entertain me." he smiled. Fuck, I forgot how well did the Quidditch uniform suit him... "I'm just genuinely amused with this whole soap opera you have and I'm counting the minutes down to see how long does Diggory lasts to dump you."I felt the rage accumulating in my guts as fire. I swear to Merlin only Fred Weasley could make me feel like that."Oh shut up, Weasley! I already fucked Cedric! Actually, I did it in the Fourth Year, ages ago, so you come a bit late, you prick. Now, keep silent and think of a better thing to piss me off about."At first, Fred was with a big surprised face and his eyes open widely but then he made himself recover his arrogant gesture, "I don't believe you.""Oh, so you've been this time bothering me about Cedric only being near because he wanted to shag me but once I told you he already did, you don't believe me?! Fuck off.""It's true though." Draco intervened catching his broom from the floor and looking completely unbothered. "I can guarantee you my Second Year self is a bit traumatized after hearing the two of them moaning while I was in the living room at 3 A.M."I felt the blood accumulating in my cheeks."What the fuck were you doing in the living room at 3 A.M?" I muttered.He simply shrugged.I looked back to Fred and he was giving Draco a deadly stare. He looked very pissed off for no fucking reason. His eyes went back on me and gave me that arrogant up-to-down look.I bet he was thinking about something witty to respond but Hotch arrived first. She started to sort of us in the different groups. I ended up being with George Weasley, Alicia Spinet, Draco, two girls from Ravenclaw and one boy from Hufflepuff. And, of course, we had to play against Fred's team.When they were separated from each other, both twins made a dramatic farewell while they faked crying. They were genuinely funny, what a pity that Fred and most of his mates were complete assholes.While he reincorporated in his position as Beater, our eyes encountered and, as his smile declined, his eyes became tougher.Hooch whistled and we all started to fly. I quickly caught the bludger and hit it straight to one of the Chasers, while Draco quickly started seeking the Snitch. The boy from the other team, who was substituting Cedric, was pretty good but Draco was far way more competitive. Spinet hit the Quaffle and scored. Then Adrian Pucey, in the other team, also scored, avoiding the bludger George threw at him. He was one of the best ones in our Slytherin team.We kept playing for a while and the scores were quite tied, we were winning just with five points of difference. I got the two Bludgers in the air and quickly passed one of them to George and he caught it in the air. I was discovering that we worked really well as a pair. About to hit my bludger against Pucey, some pushed me and nearly threw me off my broom and made me fail the hit. I looked by my side and Fred gave me a cocky look."Out of the way, Arambella," he mumbled.I caught the Bludger again and focusing my anger on my player skills, I threw it to Pucey the exact moment he was about to score. I blocked his strike."Good shot, Lilith." George congratulated me, as he passed by my side, quite surprised.I smiled at him and then waited to see Fred catch his Bludger, and started to fly in his direction. When he was about to hit Alicia Spinnet, I blocked him, almost throwing myself against him. He dropped the ball and Alicia scored. Two seconds later, Draco got the Snitch, giving us the victory.Fred complained groaning, as he flew to the floor, absolutely mad. I high-fived Draco and said 'well played' to George, Spinnet and the rest of the players.When I got to the floor, I could felt Fred's anger over me so I decided to play his game and look at him with the most arrogant face I could. He went back to the Gryffindor masculine changing room, being followed by a smiley George.As the other match also finished, I kept practising in the field on my own, only accompanied by Draco who, half an hour later, had to leave. When I finished the last training I was the last one in the field and Hotch was already picking the balls to put them in their box.I was a bit sweaty so I took off my shirt, staying with the uniform trousers and the sportive top, and went straight to the Slytherin changing room.Feeling the mixture of both cold and hot air coming from me, I was about to tie my hair up when big hands surrounded my waist to pin me against the wall.What the fuck is he doing?!

I was trapped between the lockers and Fred Weasley's body, with very little air separating us.His brown eyes looked at me with old rage and fury."You've cheated," he grumbled."I didn't and you know it damn well, Weasley." I smiled cynically at him, his breath became heavier and faster. He was still wearing his sweaty Quidditch uniform and I felt so exposed since I was still only with my trousers and my sportive top, but I decided to ignore it so I didn't look like I was scared of him. "I told you once I would beat you in a fair play.""You nearly threw me off my broom when I was about to hit Malfoy." he spat, coming closer. "I told you once if you ever touched me again, I'd make you regret it.""And what are you going to do, huh?" I asked with sarcasm. My back hit the lockers behind me as I tried to put some distance between us. "By how close you are it looks like you are going to kiss me."He gave me a look charged with disdain and despise, and put some distance between us, giving me a break to discreetly catch my breath again. Having him so close made my body react in a way my mind wished it didn't."Not even in your wildest dreams," he claimed, full of himself. Fred passed his long fingers through his hair, marking the muscles in his arm, as he put his other hand in his waist. He seemed pretty peeved. "Merlin, I swear I hate you so fucking much.""Well, the feeling goes both sid-" I was about to finish the sentence when a pair of lips invaded mine, Fred's lips, to be specific.He had walked in less than a second the little distance that separated us and surrounding my waist with his arm to put me glued to his body, he kissed me furiously and passionately. His fingers in my naked skin burnt me and made me silently beg for more. To my own surprise, I responded to his lips immediately and an unknown hunger in the deepest part of my body got pleased. As he moved against my mouth, his other hand went to my neck where he grabbed the nape with his four fingers while his thumb was in the middle of my throat.While his touch was rough and firm, his lips were warm and soft. His tongue played with mine, giving me chills all over my body, I took my hands to his hair and heard his groan in approval. The way he kissed me made me feel as if I was in the middle of a bonfire since the heat coming from our bodies invaded the room, he was kissing me in a sinful and demanding way, making me weak before him. I could almost say he was fucking me with his mouth and it was even better than what I imagined, the way I could feel my undies going wet and soaked against me confirmed it. My mind got dizzy and my legs almost faltered what made him took his hands to my bum firmly to catch me. He pinned me against the lockers hardly and I surprised myself surrounding his hips with my legs, gaining another groan from him and making him move one of his hands to my cheek."Freddie? The bets are going to start! Where are you?!" I heard George's voice from outside. Fred quickly broke the kiss and we both looked at each other with our eyes opened widely. We separated as if we had burnt each other and I hurried to get my shirt and put it on.Without looking at me again, Fred went directly to the door."Yes, Georgie. I'm here, let's go," he said with his voice deeper than usual and a bit edgy.Once he left, I focused on normalizing my breath and swallowed hard. I could still feel the taste of his lips on mine. What the fuck just happened?I changed my clothes back to the school uniform while thinking about what happened and reliving the moment in my head. I never thought I would kiss Fred Weasley, or that he would kiss me whatsoever. I was still angry with my body by the way it reacted to Fred, I can say that not even Cedric was ever able to turn me on that fast. Damn you, Weasley.I got out of the changing room and remembered the second task was about to happen in less than half an hour. Since it took place in the lake, we had to take some boats to get us there so I went fast to the quay.Almost everyone was already gone, I could visualize how only two boats were left. Fuck it, how much time did I spent in the changing room?I saw Neville talking to Harry Potter and I quickly went straight to them. Thank Merlin I wasn't the only one who didn't leave yet."Neville!" I called him and both boys turned around. The Longbottom kid received me with a big smile while Potter looked at me with kinda uncomfortable and forced kindness."Hey, Lilith! I'm showing Harry how to use the Gillyweed, you haven't left yet?""No, I got...busy at the Quidditch field," I said, avoiding, of course, how I got busy."That's okay, we can grab one of the boats right there," Neville said still smiling. "They are only for two people but Harry is going in the ones meant for the competitors.""Yeah, by the way, thank you for helping Neville to get this." Potter talked for the first time, kinda awkwardly, and keeping his distance as if he didn't trust me at all. "I hope you didn't get in trouble with your uncle.""It's okay, Professor Snape will not notice it."He nodded and, waving at both of us still awkwardly, he said goodbye while walking away to the competitors' boats' zone."Come on," Neville started a few seconds later. "Let's get the boat or we will not get there in time."I started walking behind him."Do you think Potter will make it with the Gillyweed?" I asked."I hope so, everyone in Gryffindor has their hopes in him," Nev replied."Well yeah, I'm with Hufflepuff in this, sorry.""It's okay, you are friends with Cedric the same way I'm friends with Harry. It's obvious you're going to support him."Without any other word, we got to the place of the boats but found out that we weren't alone."I told you if we made the bets here we would lose the boat, you idiot!" George Weasley patted his brother while closing a little box between his hands. "We should have done them at the lake."Fred didn't answer to him since he was deadly quiet with his hands inside the pockets of his trousers and his eyes looking at the floor. Apparently, he also changed his clothes since now, he was wearing a sweater, a beanie and normal jeans."What's going on with you, mate? You are so quiet." George continued.Fuck, I hope they don't see us."Hey, guys!" Neville practically shouted at them while waving. He quickly got their attention and they started to walk in our direction.I felt how the blood left my face and suddenly, I wanted to throw Neville at the lake. When both twins got in front of us, George had a kind smile on his face but Fred was looking at me with his eyes opened broadly and I felt my cheeks warming. I wanted to take my eyes off him but I couldn't."Hey, you two," George said. "How are you, Nev?... Lilith, you look a bit flustered, you good?"I got out of my dreamy state and forced myself to look at him and ignore his brother."Y-yeah, I'm good. Just a bit tired.""Okay..." he replied a bit confused and not too convinced. His eyes went back to his brother and then, something in his head must have clicked, because he looked at him as if he had just made a discovery. "Well, are you going to see the task too?" recovering his normal tone.Neville and I nodded at the same time."Yeah, we are going to catch one of those two boats.""So are we."The four of us approached the boats in what to me felt like an awkward atmosphere. The two rowboats were ready and Neville, like the gentleman he was, let me get in one of them, first. When he was about to get in it as well, George grabbed his sleeve."Mate, have you seen Fred and I's bet system? We are going to gain all the money from those rich pricks from Drumstrang. Why don't you come with me to see it?"Oh, no, no, no, no.He basically dragged Neville with him to the other boat and in less than a minute they were on their way to the other part of the lake.Shit.Fred was staring with an annoyed glare at the place where his twin and Neville were sailing. With a huge sigh, he got into my same boat and grabbed the oars."Not a word." he seethed while starting to paddle.It wasn't like I could form a single sentence at that moment. Our previous encounter was still dancing in my mind and the anxiety was hitting me hard. After a couple of minutes of complete and uncomfortable silence, he talked."What happened before..." Fred started."It never happened." I interrupted him."It was an accident," he said at the same time.He looked at me for the first time and there was a shine in his eyes that I didn't see before."I don't know why it happened but it won't repeat," he stated and I nodded. "I don't want you to kiss me ever again."EXCUSE ME?"You can be sure it won't happen again, but it was YOU the one who kissed me."He sighed, exhausted."Whatever you say, Arambella, but you get the point. I don't know what happened in my mind, maybe the air was hexed but I have to leave it clear, I would never kiss you. It was an awful mistake.""Well, I wouldn't kiss you either," I replied kinda offended, crossing my arms in front of my chess.He couldn't help but chuckle."C'mon, don't pretend you didn't like it..." he replied arrogantly."Not a bit." I quickly replied proudly."You legs around my hips said otherwise," he mumbled."Yeah, and your hands did too but I'm not reminding you, am I?""Bah! A moment of weakness. Don't have yourself in such high esteem, darling." he talked, making that 'darling' sound full of sarcasm."Whatever you say, Weasley.""You haven't been kissed like that in your entire life," he said a little bit later."Yeah, Ced kisses better.""You wish.""You are too full of yourself, man.""Oh, so are we gonna pretend I didn't get you wet?" he said lowering his voice and looking at me like a hunter to its prey when it knows it's going to win. "Because I could feel how your body reacted to me, Lilith""You wish." I imitated his words. Noticing we already got back to land, I stood up quickly off the boat. "Don't dream too much about me, Weasley," I said leaving him there.As I walked away I heard him giggling."I can tell you the same!"Bloody bastard...While I was looking for Liv, Pauline and Draco in the crowd, my mind kept going back to the conversation and the moment with Fred. He was damn right, the fucking prick, I was going to have a hard night thinking about him...

I sat next to Liv and Pauline, in one of the corners, with Neville and other two boys from his year.The competitors were preparing themselves for the task. They had to rescue one of their loved ones from down the lake where the merpeople were keeping them. All of them looked pretty nervous, even the stoic Krum. The whistle sounded and the four of them jumped into the lake."I've killed Harry Potter!" Neville cried out when he couldn't see Potter in the depths of the water."You did not, Nev. Give him a moment." I said, trying to convince him and myself that Potter was okay.Not even two seconds later, Harry did a great cartwheel out of the water showing the effect the Gillyweed had on him.While we all waited for the champions to do their task, my eyes flew to Weasley who was sat a few seats away from me. Obviously, he was next to his brother George and his little sister - Ginny, I think. He had his binoculars in his hand while looking completely entertained to the water and biting his lower lip, concentrated and amused. I couldn't help but remember the taste of his lips, the way his tongue played with mine and how he touched my naked skin with those slim vein-marked hands. I was still hungry for him and deeply I knew that hunger was not going to stop. His coat let free the skin in his neck, which was covered in little scars and moles that I wanted to kiss so bad."Lilith," Liv called me, taking me out of my daydream. "Are you okay? What are you looking at?""Nothing!" I said louder than I pretended. My mind was too busy to think about an excuse for staring at Fred Weasley.But, what kind of best friend I'd be if I didn't tell Liv and Pauline about what happened?"Girls, once the task is over, come with me to the Slytherin common room. I need to talk with you."Pauline whistled, joking."Wow, girl. You sound so dramatic. What on Earth did you do?"✵ ✵ ✵"YOU DID WHAT?!" Pauline screamed and nearly fell off my bed."I kissed him," I whispered again. The thunders could be heard outside of my window. It was nearly midnight and I even skip dinner at the Hall just not to see Weasley." Well, he kissed me...We kissed." I corrected myself.Liv had an eyebrow raised, looking discreetly amused while Pauline had a full shock face and almost couldn't believe it. She let escape a little nervous chuckle."Wow, I wasn't expecting that."I let them assimilate the news while I took one of the blueberries biscuits Liv cooked for me.She knew about me skipping dinner time and made me my favourite sweet in the world. The mere taste and smell of blueberries made me happy, it reminded me of the few happy moments I had in my early childhood where my grandmother, Eileen Prince, cooked them for me. When my mother got to Azkaban, Eileen was too old to take care of me but Severus used to take me to visit her three times a year until she died when I was nine. My times with her were pretty happy since she was trying to recover her relationship with her offspring after her abusive husband abandoned her. Apparently, it was a family thing...I still remember Severus' face one of the times he came home to take me back to the Arambella house and found me covered in blueberries. It was his favourite sweet as well when he was a child."That's why you were looking at him early, right?" Liv guessed, giving me a proud of herself look.I slightly nodded."And how does he kiss?" Pauline asked grabbing one of my pillows and hugging it.I gave a deep sigh before answering."Pretty good," I admitted. "Actually, incredibly good. The boy knows what he is doing.""So you liked it.""Not a bit!" I quickly said, too fast for letting myself believe it, pretending to be offended "I would have liked it if it wasn't Weasley the one who gave it to me.""Merlin...Lilith and Fred kissing. The end of the world is near." Liv joked."Okay, fair enough, can we already change the bloody topic?!"I asked exasperated, holding back my laughter.By the end of the night, when they already left, we had finished a whole round of more than 20 blueberry biscuits and cupcakes. My stomach was full and happy and my mind, now alone, kept dreaming about Weasley's kiss.Fuck, I don't want to do it... I really don't want to.But the bonfire in my veins asked me to, and I couldn't fight it anymore. Without the excuse of the alcohol this time, and the rain hitting my window in a bewitching melody, I touched and pleased myself thinking about Fred Weasley, more vividly than ever now that I could felt his touch, being on top of me, driving me crazy with his lips and those brown eyes full of unaccomplished fantasies. Having me weak between his arms and making him desire me until reach a lustful madness.✵ ✵ ✵"How was the rest of the night, Lilith?" Pauline said smiling, while we were walking in the corridor. Liv had DADA, I had Potions and Lin had to go back to the Beauxbatons place to have whatever class she had there.I frowned my eyebrows, surprised because of the question."Well, I went straight to bed." technically I wasn't lying..."I had a traumatic experience going back to my dorm," Liv announced dramatically. "I found out Cho Chang and Cedric hooking up in the common room couch. I'm not sitting in there ever again."Pauline and I laughed."Well, they're a couple. What did you expect?" I said looking at how Liv's cheeks blushed. "But they were like actually hooking up? And most important of all, did they saw you?""Oh, Merlin no. They were just snogging when I arrived and they didn't see me but the noises I heard afterwards while I was in my room confirmed they did more than that. And I'm disgusted at men but I kinda understand why you fucked him, Lilith."I burst into laughter."Well I can't say you are lying, can I? Facts are facts."We arrived at the stairs and had to part ways not without promising to meet again at the Hall later.I went down to the Dungeons and the door was already open. I couldn't even get to my seat when the Weasley twins made their entrance.Shit, I knew I couldn't avoid him any longer but, how I'm gonna look at him again?I thought he will give me at least a little gaze but he didn't. Ouch, my ego! Instead, he came closer to his friend group and started talking."Was Finnigan in this class before? It smells like bloody fireworks." Fred joked.I gave a little sniff and actually, it did. The entire atmosphere was drowned in a firework and powder smell mixed with... wood and honey. What the fuck was doing Snape in this class before?"What?" Jordan chuckled looking at Fred confused. " I don't smell anything, mate.""You don't? Lad, you should check your nose. This room smells like a fucking field of Quidditch after the fireworks, innit George?"George tightened his lips in response, "Sorry, Fred, I'm with Lee in this one. I don't smell any fireworks."Fred looked at him with his eyebrows frowned."It pains me to say it but I have to agree with Weasley in this." I intervened, catching their attention. Both George and Jordan gave a distant and indifferent look while Fred was staring at me, confused. "It smells like fireworks and powder."Snape entered the room, closing with his wand the window, and making all of us go silent.We were all sitting in pairs, I was next to one of the girls from Slytherin and behind me, I had both Fred and George. Bloody hell, couldn't they be at least a few seats away?"George, have you been eating blueberries? I thought you didn't like them" I heard Fred whispering behind me.I assumed George shook his head because Fred whispered even lower a 'what the fuck?'.Shit, that was probably my fault. I knew a simple shower wouldn't take the blueberry essence off me. Discreetly, I took the collar of my shirt to my nose and sniffed, but it only smelled like my perfume. Weird...Before start talking, Snape gave a slow gaze to all of us and stood at the centre of the class, with his hands behind his back."As you all should already know, feelings are a useful tool in magic. They can provide us with success or failure if we learn how to use them. They are powerful and inevitable, today we are focusing on one of the strongest ones; love.""Oh, greasy-hair Snape's getting romantic." Lee Jordan joked in a little mumble, making Fred and George hold their laughs.Luckily, Severus didn't hear him."Maybe it's out of your teenager hormonal brains, but the house you belong in affects how you love and how do you perceive love. Since only Gryffindor and Slytherin are in this class and they are two sides of the same coin, I'm going to tell you how each of them sees love." he took a deep breath and continued. "Gryffindors tend to have a positive sight of love, something happy, entertaining and pure. Real love doesn't hurt and it's easy and deserved. They love deeply and fiercely, as simple and shallow like that."Everyone started talking in low mumbles that Snape quickly silenced starting to talk again."Slytherin's love, on the other hand, is obsessive, deep and complicated. We love in an intense way that leads us to self-destructive behaviours or the search for the loves of our lives. It is happiness but is also pain. It's a weapon and a drug, and it can't be perceived otherwise. " his voice turned melancholic and his eyes were lost. Everyone remained quiet. "When a Slytherin loves, the hunger for their lover and the abandonment fear makes them risk everything and being able to things the other houses are not even able to imagine. The desire to be loved covers and takes over them. It is like you are drowning, you let it consume you or you fight uselessly counter-current."An annoying nuisance installed inside me before those words. They were painfully true. The room was deadly quiet while we were all absorbed in our own thoughts."For Merlin's sake, who broke him?" one of the boys from Gryffindor joked in a low voice, trying to erase the tension in the room."That's why today I decided to show you how love, in the wrong hands, can be lethal. Before this class started, I prepared a special potion and I'll let you smell it. This potion is used to create a false idea of love in another person, it bewitches and absorbs. And for your own sake, I won't recommend you to use it with anyone. I expect everyone to know what potion I'm talking about."Oh, no.I swallowed hard because of how nervous I felt."Can someone tell me the name?"I raised my hand, shyly and Snape nodded letting me speak."Amortentia, sir."

"Once you finish your potions, I want you to put them on this shelf. They will be examined." Snape announced after giving us the instructions to make the potion.For a good moment, I had a distraction from my thoughts about Fred. But I can't deny they were still at the bottom of my mind. Half an hour later, we were all ready to put our little bottles with the Amortentia on them on the shelf. Snape left for a moment, not before ordering us to make a queue and, of course, I had to be next to Fred and George."Honestly, lad, this potion does stink."George chuckled, "Really? Mine smells like strawberries...kinda weird.""Aye, I can even tell you those are fireworks from the bloody Holyhead Harpies, only a shitty team like that could have such bad fireworks." he laughed.OH, HE DID NOT FUCKING DARE."NOT WITH THE HARPIES, YOU BITCH" I couldn't help but shout. "They are the best team out there." Both twins turned around and while George was giving me an amused look, Fred stared at me with his eyebrows frowned."Yeah, Freddie, they're pretty good," George said laughing like he was just joking. "Not as good as the Montrose Magpies or Kenmare Kestrels, though.'"Bah! Rubbish. Even Ron's team is better than them.""You two fucking wished." I spat actually annoyed. The Holyhead Harpies were my favourite Quidditch team since I was a little girl and everything I knew from Quidditch was because of them.Fred was about to reply but Snape entered the room and he had to lower his tone."Let the real players talk, Lili," he said full of sarcasm and irony."Don't call me Lili!""Oh for God's sake, do not call her Lili," Snape said with an exhausted tone at the same time as me. Apparently, Fred spoke loud enough for Severus to hear him.At the exact moment when that name abandoned Fred's mouth, I felt the flashbacks and the memories hit me like a truck. Only my mother called me Lili and every time someone suggested the idea of calling me like that I felt an enormous sorrow and despise."YOU CAN'T ABANDON ME, LILI" her old and bony hand with long nails trapped mine between the thick bars. Her whispery voice was more like the hiss of a snake rather than a human. Even in 

 darkness, I could still see her long brown hair tangled and her thin face with all the bones of her face marked making her look even more terrifying. She was on the floor, not even able to stand up because of the tortures the Dementors put her through.

"Please, mother, let me go." I cried out sitting on the floor, in front of the bars, with the old and nasty rock pavement hurting my knees and feeling her fingers strangling my wrist. I could already see the bruises on my skin.

"Lili, he is coming back. I know it. I feel it. He is coming back and he will need you." she kept saying while she tried to put me closer to her. "The Dark Lord is coming for you. Your only purpose in life is to be his, Lili. Make me proud, have revenge over the bastard of your father and erase that mud blood in your veins!"

Using her sharp dirty nails she caught my arm and started to scratch my skin, making me bleed, trying to draw the Dark Mark in it, ignoring my screams of pain and my watery eyes.

"MOTHER, PLEASE, NO!" I tried desperately to move away from her, sobbing and choking on my own tears.

"He will come for you. And if he doesn't, I will. You cannot escape from me, Lili."That was the last thing Circe Snape told me when in 1991 I announced to her I could not come back to see her again. I felt my heart racing and my hands shaking. Unconsciously, I took my hand to the place in my forearm where she tried to engrave the Dark Mark. Luckily, Severus arrived before she could finish it and took me away from her, the only reminder left was my own memory and the little scars in the place where she tried to hurt me.I lifted my eyes and found my uncle looking at me with attention, he seemed to be studying my reactions since he knew very well how much that name triggered me.Just after we all put our bottles in their place, Snape announced the class was over. While everyone was packing their stuff and leaving, I approached Severus' desk."I wanted to have a word with you," I said, calling his attention.He sighed harshly."I know that name-""Not that." I stopped him before he continued. "I want to ask you a favour."His eyes became colder."I want you to treat with more empathy and decency one of your students from Fourth Year""Who is it?" he said pretty confusedly."Neville Longbottom. I know you have the poor boy terrified and I think you are too old for playing the bully card, Severus." I gave him a severe stare. "I know you don't precisely like him but the kid tries his best and he can't do it with you being literally his boggart."He clicked his tongue in disapproval but after I crossed my arms in front of my chest and looked at him with one of my eyebrows raised, he finally gave up."Will you stop avoiding me and being an unthankful capricious and rude brat if I do so?"I wanted to literally spit on his face but I held myself back."Yes, uncle, I will," I said instead, faking a nice and a bit childish tone."Fine, now leave."Without any other word, I grabbed tightly my bag and turned around. I found just a few students left, talking with each other and leaving already. They seemed to not have heard our conversation, except from one specific boy. Fred was looking at me with one of his eyebrows raised and confusion radiating from him. I didn't want to give him any explanation, and I didn't have to, so I simply ignored him and left back to the Hall where I was expected to meet Liv and Pauline.When I got to the Hall, nor Olivia or Pauline was there so, not being very happy about it, I simply sat at the Slytherin table with nothing else than a coffee. The eco from my memory didn't let me be in the mood for anything else."Lilith, are you okay?" Draco asked, next to me, looking actually concerned."Yeah, I am, don't worry," I said, focusing out of my mind I saw how everyone in the Hall was whispering and talking. "What's going on?""Everybody is nervous because of the third and last task. They are trying to guess what it is going to be about." Blaise, who was sitting in front of us, talked."I'm not getting a good vibe from it," I whispered.Draco looked at me, confused."You should stop spending so much time with the Lovegoods, they are going to pass into you their madness."I punched his arm hard and he complained loudly but didn't talk back, just rubbed the place where I hit him."Respect them, don't be such a dickhead.""Whatever you say." he simply said making a little pout with his lips. "But don't be mad at me.""Behave yourself so I won't."Blaise looked at the two of us, amused. He knew that I'm one of the few people who Draco respected and actually cared about.Minutes later, Pauline and Liv entered together and approached us. Even though they couldn't sit at our table, they came to ask me to hang out with them at the Gardens."Arambella had her uncle defending her again, what's new right?" one of the boys from Gryffindor complained aloud at his house's table. Loud enough for me to hear it and to make eye contact with him. He had a mischievous look on his face that made me so uncomfortable."Shut your mouth before I do, Alton," I warned him from my table, before standing up."You know what? Actually, I don't like your last name. I think Snape suits you better." he continued, ignoring my threat. "Or should I call you 'Lili'?"The rage invaded my body and I could feel Draco and Liv freezing. Both knew the meaning of that name and how much I hated it."You son of a bitch...""What are you going to do, huh? Curse me?" he mocked me.But I had a better idea."Yeah, you are right, I can't touch you. But it's just that I don't think you want to use Circe Snape's favourite word besides the Imperio curse, do you? Unless you want me to call you mommy." I replied sarcastically, making everyone go silent and in front of all of them and making sure they were watching me, I handed Liv my wand. She looked at me confused but anyway, grabbed it.Giving me a last arrogant gaze, he looked triumphally to his mates and took the fork full of food to his mouth, I knew that was my moment.Without my wand, and focusing on him, I pronounced the word silently in my head.Sectumsempra

In the exact moment those words formed in my brain, Neville Longbottom slightly pushed the Alton boy making him bite his tongue as the curse hit him secretly. He started to choke with his food and suddenly the blood was coming out of his lips. It wasn't a massive amount but it was indeed enough for having his friends worried."I'm okay, I'm okay. I bit my tongue." I heard him say while wiping his mouth with a napkin. He gave Neville a despised look. "What the fuck are you doing, Longbottom?""Stop being so rude to her. There is no need at all for that," he answered bravely, under the surprise of the entire Gryffindor table. His eyes met mine and I gave him a thankful smile that he replied.Since my magic without my wand was not very powerful, Alton's haemorrhage stopped pretty quickly.I took my eyes off him and looked around me. Draco was observing me with narrowed eyes and a proud smile. However, I could feel how both Liv and Pauline grabbed my arms and made me discreetly walk away from there.Once we were at the Garden, under one of the trees, far from everyone else, Pauline asked, shocked."Mon Dieu! What was that?"Liv's eyes were focused on me, looking straight to my soul."She made silent magic," she answered without taking her sight from me.I couldn't help but laugh. The bitch knew me so well..."I did," I said indifferently."You can do that?!" Pauline asked still not out of her shock."Yes, but no one knows and I want it to stay like that.""Lilith, that's super-advanced magic. Only the best-prepared wizards can do it.""The best-prepared ones and me. But nobody knows it, that's why I handed Olivia my wand, so nobody would suspect, and thanks to Neville, that wasn't even necessary." I stretch out, sitting on the grass and leaning against the tree."Let me guess." Olivia started giving me my wand back. "Sectumsempra, right?"I nodded proudly."You are impossible." she laughed ironically. "You know that curse is almost forbidden and still, you risk yourself in front of everyone.""Nobody noticed it, Liv.""I did." she interrupted me."Nobody that doesn't know me from up to down noticed it." I corrected myself. "Besides, you heard what he called me and I can't allow that, can I?"She sighed and sat next to me, leaving Pauline standing up in front of us just as confused as before."Wait, come again, how did he call you?"Lili," I whispered. "He called me Lili.""And? Is that so bad for you to cut his tongue?""That's how her mother called her." Liv intervened grabbing my hand discreetly. She was the only witness of the nightmares I had where Circe called me that while trying to kill me, or what was worse, to make me a murdered just like her, she knew how deeply that word hurt me and certainly, she knew how fucking mad it turned me.Pauline opened her eyes widely."Oh." she simply said, letting herself sit in front of us." Shit.""Yeah.""I understand you," she mumbled. "If I were you, I wouldn't have been able to control myself, girl. I would straight curse him aloud.""What surprised me was Neville standing up for you. What's going on between you two?" Liv asked, genuinely surprised."Oh, that poor kid. I found him a random day at the library and helped him with Potions. You know Severus has a weird obsession with that boy and he really hates him. He's such a kind soul so I even talked to Snape to make him calm down a bit with Nev.""Ugh, your uncle can be such a pain in the ass when he wants to.""Tell me about it!"We kept chatting a bit, just enjoying the fresh air from March. Suddenly, the doors from the Hall opened, and a group of Gryffindors from Sixth Year walked the corridor, talking with each other. I felt a couple of eyes observing me and quickly, distinguished Fred Weasley's strong stare over me. He seemed both intrigued and confused as if it was the first time he saw me.What is going on in your mind, Weasley?

Time kept passing and soon, we were at the end of the school year. Mad-Eye's classes were still horrible, but at least they were bearable. Every student's emotions became tenser as the final task of the Tournament was near. My friendship with Neville and Pauline became even closer, and about Fred... nothing. Everything with him went back to normal; the laughs, the arguments and the mockery, it was almost like that kiss never happened.Even though it was pretty alive in my mind before going to sleep."Lin, how is Fleur about tomorrow's task?" Liv asked while we were hanging out together at the Garden."She's scared but also very excited, she says she feels like in a rollercoaster," Pauline said, licking her orange ice lolly and putting on her sunglasses. Her accent had changed a lot during these months, because of Liv and I's influence, now she spoke with a mixture of French, British and American accent which resulted very attractive.It was a pretty bright day for being in the Scottish highlands and we all were enjoying the sunny weather with our ice lollies and almost-summer vibes. Liv was by my side, leaning against the tree trunk with her blue heart-shaped sunglasses, hiding from the sun since it wasn't very good for her skin and I was resting in her lap enjoying my blueberry-flavoured sweet."The world's ending, Harry. I'm telling you." I heard little Weasley, speaking at the other corner of the Garden. Apparently, they just got out of class and soon, they were joined by Weasley girl and the twins.Unintentionally, my entire attention focused straight on them. I was still fighting against the tingles and restlessness that appeared in my guts every time I thought about Fred Weasley, even though I didn't know how to stop it or to calm it."Why is it, Ronnie? Did Krum finally confessed his love for you" Fred joked, resting his arm on Ron's shoulder."No," he softly replied, so shocked that he didn't even care about his brother's comment. "We just left Potions and you won't believe it, but Neville got one of the best marks in the last exam and Snape treated him well."Both Fred and George scowled."Snape is getting soft, huh?" George smiled."I don't know but it was very weird." Potter intervened, "It was like if Snape didn't want to treat Neville so well but he had to.""You see? I wouldn't be surprised if now McGonagall announces she's dating Mrs Norris."Everyone chuckled except for one person who wasn't paying attention at all. His eyes met mine and narrowed, examining me, connecting dots. I didn't want Fred to think I was listening to their conversation or that I helped Neville whatsoever because even though I had good intentions, they would find a way to put it against me and I didn't want it to affect Nev.✵ ✵ ✵Everyone was hyping up the contestants before they enter the labyrinth. All of them were incredibly excited and the public roared, the past snug towards Potter already disappear and he was being as hyped as the other ones. I was sitting next to Draco, saving the two seats next to me for Olivia and Pauline - who I haven't seen in all day because of the classes -, pretty close to the field where we had a very clear view of everything that was happening.The task started and Cedric, Fleur, Krum and Potter entered the maze. While we waited for the results, I let my head rest on Draco's shoulder. I was terribly tired since the last couple of nights I had ugly nightmares, which were nothing else than polluted memories, and barely slept three hours. I kept dreaming about my mother scaping from Azkaban, He-who-must-not-be-named coming back and me being tortured by them because I didn't want to join him."You good?" Draco asked a bit concerned, passing his arm over my shoulder and stroking my arm.I nodded, still a bit sleepy. "Yeah, don't worry. 'M just tired."A few minutes later, Liv y Pauline arrived at the same time and sat in the seats I had reserved for them."What took you so long?" I asked them still against Draco's body.Liv was about to talk but Pauline intervened first."Just got late out of class."Liv nodded as she blushed. I think I need to have a little conversation with her.The minutes kept going and Liv cast the spell to appear popcorn, I changed my position and ended up leaning against Liv who let her fingers caress my hair. I took a peek at the rest of the crowd which was in the upper seats. Granger and Little Weasley were surrounded by their housemates and looking very concentrated on the field. It was weird to see the two of them on their own without Potter. The Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws were talking with each other, ranking who they thought was more likely to win the task. Fred and George were next to their sister, counting the money they earned thanks to the bets.My eyes went back to Liv and I noticed how she kept looking at Pauline and at the same time, tried not to make it so obvious. I couldn't help but chuckle in a little voice."You like her, don't you?" I asked her in a whisper.She froze in her seat with popcorn in its way to her mouth."W-who?" she pretended not to know, but I knew her too well."We both know who." I simply said and I felt her shoulders relax and a sigh leaving her mouth. "And I'm pretty sure she likes you back.""How do you know?""You couldn't get that late out of class, Liv, all the professors let their students arrive early to the task. I'm not dumb." I said with a smile. "And I'm sure that you two didn't stay to handle hands and pick flowers, did you?"Liv blushed even harder."It didn't happen what you think it did, though," she said quickly. "Just...""You don't have to give me any explanations, mate" I snickered a little bit but then went serious when I thought about my next words. "I'm really happy for you two, and I don't want to ruin whatever you two have, but keep in mind that she's leaving back to France in two days. I don't want you to suffer, Liv."I was genuinely concerned about her because I knew that Olivia's romantic emotions were too powerful even for her to handle them. I would be with her, supporting her, no matter what but she had already suffered enough to add to the list a long-distance love."I know, but...I want to keep the magic just a little bit longer," she replied with an innocent tone."That's alright, Liv. You know I'll be with you whatever happens." I said leaving a little kiss on her shoulder and focusing again on the field.Minutes later, Harry Potter appeared in the field with the Triwizard coup in the grass and leaning against who seemed to be Cedric. Probably, he was tired of running that much around the labyrinth corners...Everyone started cheering up and music sounded. The Gryffindors were almost out of their seats, but Harry wasn't moving."Lilith!" Draco mumbled hitting my knee to call my attention. "Diggory is not moving."What?I looked confused at the field and noticed that Potter was still looking at Cedric, leaned on the ground. Fleur Delacour screamed and Dumbledore ran where the two boys were while making the music stop. My uncle soon followed him and the words that came out of Potter's mouth made me almost faint."He's back." Harry cried.And even though he didn't mention his name, I knew exactly who he was talking about.No, please no. Not him. Not him, not again. Please.Everybody started to stand up, concerned.The minister, Cornelius Fudge, talked to Snape, "Keep everybody in their seats! A boy has just been killed."NO. NO. NO.I felt the blood leaving my head and had to sit down again, hyperventilating while hearing everybody gasping.Cedric's dad came down the stairs and ran to his son's body.No, that couldn't be real. That could not be happening. Cedric. My 

. My friend. No.I felt my hands wet and some drops of water, and I thought it was raining, but the sky was clear. They were tears. My tears."No! That's my son!" Mr Diggory cried, hugging the dead body of his child. "That's my boy!"I burst to cry and hugged Draco who caressed my back.No. Not Cedric. Not him.Cho Chang was crying desperately. Oh, that poor girl...McGonagall ordered us to leave our common room until the situation was solved. But how would they solve that?While everyone was walking away, I changed my direction to the empty Gardens.Air, I needed air."Lilith!" I heard Liv shouting at me with her voice hoarse because of how much she was crying. "Where are you going?!"But I didn't answer back. I made sure that no professor saw me and hid behind one of the columns. Hearing the voices and the sobbing disappear in the school walls.Cedric. Dead.I started crying again and felt my hands trembling. I let my back slither all over the column to the floor, where I sat.One of my closest friends, the first boy that paid me attention, my first romantic interest, a good soul...Fuck, he was so young! He had all a life to live, he was so good, so gentile. I sobbed even harder, taking my hands to my hair.I didn't say goodbye to him, I couldn't give him one last hug. My heart started to race and it became more difficult for me to breathe. The last words I told him were 'don't make me lose the bet'. Not an 'I care about you', not a 'good luck', not an 'I appreciate you', not a 'thanks for everything you have done for me'.I felt like rubbish, he was too good for this world and I didn't deserve him. I was so lucky to have a friend like him and I couldn't even protect him. I couldn't protect him from that son of a bitch, who was back.The chills covered my body at the mere thought of his name. One of my worst nightmares was becoming real...If he is back, that means they are going to be back as well and that's....that's the worst thing that could happen to me.The tears kept coming down to the point that I almost felt I was going to drown in them. Maybe that was the best, to stop thinking, to stop existing for a moment, to avoid my mother the pleasure of killing me herself once I tell her I'm not joining her...No, you can't escape from her, remember? Fight her. Fight him."Where are you taking me?" I heard Potter's weepy voice. I lifted my eyes and saw Harry being almost dragged by Mad-Eye Moody, who seemed to be taking him to his office.I stood up and wiped out my tears. Silently, I followed them because I wanted to ask Harry what he saw.If He-who-must-not-be-named was back, I was definitely up to fight him and making him go back to the black hole where he belonged.The two of them entered Moody's office and I felt how it was locked from the inside. I decided to wait in behind the walls until Potter comes out. I certainly did not want Mad-Eye Moody to see me because if He was back, Mad-Eye would be sure I would be joining the Death Eaters and probably kill me right there before letting me prove it wrong.After a couple of minutes in where my mind went dizzy and blurry with Cedric's memory still on my mind, Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall appeared on the other stairs. They were walking fast, almost running, with their wands ready to Moody's office. Without saying a word, Dumbledore opened the door and the three of them entered aggressively.What was going on?I stayed right there, focused on hearing their conversation."Severus!" Dumbledore said and the next thing I could hear was Mad-Eye choking. "You know who I am?""Albus...Dumbledore." Mad-Eye's voice talked, but it sounded like if it wasn't his."Are you Mad-Eye Moody?""...No"No...

What the fuck?!My heart started racing and I felt its beat in every inch of my body."Is he in this room?!"Silence..."Polyjuice potion..." I recognised my uncle's voice.I frowned my eyebrows, confused and scared. Who was that person?Dumbledore whispered something I couldn't hear."Barty Crouch Jr..." Dumbledore spoke again.Oh, hell no...I felt like my soul left my body. That son of a bitch used to be in a cell in Azkaban, near my mother's, and he was known for being one of the maddest and dangerous of the followers of He-who-must-not-be-named. I remember him trying to convince my mother to mark me as a kid before they both were sent to Azkaban, saying how perfect a Death Eater could be if they were raised by Death Eaters with the only purpose of serving him.I took my hand to the scars on my forearm and I couldn't listen anymore. My mind was blinded by the memories of a young man playing with 2-year-old me as he talked to my mother that even though my blood was polluted, I could be their greatest weapon. I remember him suggesting my mother use the Crucio curse over the Prewetts before they died. And I remember him offering himself to mark me in case my mother was 'too weak to do it'.That son of a bitch....So I've been deadly scared of the Auror judging me because of Circe's sins and it turns out he was one of the deadliest Death Eaters to ever exist. He cursed me to show me the power they had, he provoked me and humiliated me to prove that a Death Eater's child would always be a Death Eater.The door opened again and my uncle came out of it while escorting a tall and thin man, a bit wasted away, with black clothes. Only the two of them walked down the stairs in my direction."The dementors are going to be so happy to have you back, Crouch." Snape talked grabbing the Death Eaters sleeve harder."You fucking traitor, he is going to find you and slowly kill you and the filthy slut you have as a niece!" the other answered him with a sharp and snake-like voice.They got to the floor where I was and walked in the opposite direction, without seeing me. Being as silent as I could, I followed them and making sure nobody was watching us, I got close.In a very little, fast but solid movement, I grabbed Crouch by his coat and pinned him against the wall with my wand against his cheek and my other hand grabbing his neck and pressing, all of this under Severus' surprised look."You fucking bastard," I growled and felt the empathy and any kind of human decency leave my body. "I should cut your tongue and make you swallow it."The rage invaded my body and my mind travelled into crazy and dark ways to hurt him. Without being a surprise to me, he smiled arrogantly and full of madness, even though he was in a weaker position."Hello, Little Snape." Crouch talked, very close to me. "Ready to play?"

"You have already been playing with me all this fucking time," I grumbled putting more pressure over his neck with my wand."Oh, yeah, and you can't imagine how much I enjoyed it," he whispered, still with that disrupted smile. "Making you feel the pain your mother put those blood traitors through was the most amusing thing I've done in this school. You should have seen your watery eyes and how you tried to challenge me." he laughed hysterically. "You really thought I was Mad-Eye Moody, didn't you?""Are you becoming one of the good ones now, Crouch? Torturing the Slytherin children..., that sounds like Auror shit to me.'"What would mommy Snape think when she knows her dearest daughter, her best weapon for the Dark Lord, is now a blood traitor slut?" he threatened, grabbing a piece of my hair in his hand, showing he was not afraid of me. "I cursed you to show you how powerful you'd be if you were by our side, I cursed you to show my power over you.""Don't touch her." Snape spat with his usual calm voice, catching Crouch arm from my hair and giving him a piercing look.Crouch laughed with disdain as Snape started to drag him, walking away."You know what, Lilith? I'll be such a hero once I go back to Azkaban that maybe your mother finally lets me fuck her. " he chuckled turning his neck around to look at me, " I'll let her call me 'Ares' if she wants to."The rage invaded me from up to down and with my vision sharper and redder than ever, I grabbed my wand and pointed at him."You know what, Crouch? I think we're not even here. You cursed me with one of the Unforgivables, but I haven't had the chance to do it to you.""What can a traitor's bitch possibly curse? You don't have what it takes, Little Snape."He cursed me with an Imperio. He abused his power over me. He was one of my mother's favourites. He tried to mark me when I was a baby knowing that the mark was so painful to receive that the pain could have killed me. He agreed on trying to make me a weapon for their Dark Lord.He fucking cursed me.Now is my turn."CRUCIO!" I shouted and watched how the red light hit him under the disconcerted look of my uncle.Barty Crouch Jr fell to the floor and started to writhe in pain, alternating his screams with his hysterical laughter.Every time you do an unforgivable curse, you have to feel them for them to work. Feel it, Lilith! Feel it!"Oh, dear." the son of a bitch sighed with a whiny and exhausted voice. "You could have been an incredible Death Eater."I growled out loud and attempted to curse him again but Snape's body got in between us and grabbed my hand almost strangling it."What do you think you are doing, Lilith Medea?!" he spat with disappointment. "Are you going out of your mind?""Move, Severus." I slowly mouthed."To let you perform an unforgivable curse? I think I won't." he put more strength in his grip. "I'll let pass this one because you are my niece, but if you ever dare to curse one of them again and follow your mother's path, I will not hesitate to send you to a cell in Azkaban by her side, understood?"I bit my tongue because I wanted to believe he was not capable of hurting me like that, but at that moment, I wasn't really sure about it. I slowly put my wand down, under Snape's severe eyes and Crouch's amused ones.Without any other word, Snape turned around and lifted Crouch from the floor, who complained while looking at him with absolute despise and walking away together.Still trying to digest Snape's words and everything that happened today, I felt a huge emptiness and exhaustion in my body. Letting my mind go blank, I simply took my cigarettes and my lighter from the pocket on my shirt and sat in the step that led to the Garden. Not a single soul was there and I preferred it that way. As I put the cig in my mouth and was about to light it, I couldn't help but stop in the midway and have all thoughts hitting me at once. My face was unexpressive but one single tear, with all the emotions and feelings inside of me concentrated in it, went down my cheek.I'm so tired of living this life."Here you are." I heard a masculine voice by my side. I found Fred Weasley leaning on his right shoulder against the wall looking at me pretty serious, but it seemed as if all his barriers were down. I didn't even know at what point he approached me because of how inside of my own thoughts I was."What do you want?" I asked, still with the non-lightened cig hanging off my lips, without bothering to sound mean or even ironic. I wasn't in the mood for anything.He sighed and turned his body so now his back was against the wall. He seemed to question his words before speaking, something Fred never used to do."Can I have one?" he said pointing to my pack.I never knew he smoked and in any other situation I would have told him to fuck off and leave me alone, but I was so exhausted and drained of any emotion that I didn't care to share a cigarette with Fred Weasley. I nodded and handed him the pack with the lighter so he could grab it by himself. I stared at him fixedly as he took it and put the cig between his lips, lightening with the precision of a usual smoker. I want to say I didn't focus on how his jaw clenched while he was holding the cigarette with his mouth or how his facial expression became rougher as he took the first breath while lightening it, but I would be lying.He gave me back both things and I lightened mine. The first puff felt like therapy and I felt a very little bit less miserable. I even closed my eyes to feel the smoke even more. I would drown in it if I could."I'm sorry," he intervened in a neutral voice after a while, "about Cedric. I'm really sorry and I do know you genuinely cared a lot for him. You must be feeling like shit."I felt so empty that his words didn't even surprise me. I sighed hard again."He had a whole life to live, he was a good person and did not deserve it at all." I let the words I cried before free without even thinking. They were written in my tears but I needed to pronounce them aloud. "It's the fact that I think I won't see him again that rips off my heart, and just thinking how Cho must be feeling...oh Merlin, that poor girl.""You loved him?" he asked carefully, no mockery, no irony. Just a normal question.I let my mind consider the question a couple of times before answering it."Not in the way you are thinking. I did once, a long time ago, but he wasn't meant for me because I don't deserve someone as good as him. He cared about me and I cared about him. He was my friend. One of the few ones. So yes, I loved him." I replied with the smoke leaving my mouth.I don't know if it was because of how tired I felt or because of how those words burnt in my consciousness while I was crying earlier and now I could set them free, but for some reason, I felt comfortable talking with Fred."As much as you love that Lovegood girl?""I don't love anyone as much as I love Olivia, Fred. Not even myself. She's the only person that doesn't abandon me." I noticed how much I was revealing of myself so I choked a bit. "Forget I just said that."He let a little voiceless chuckle leave his mouth as he gave another puff. Once again, there was no irony or mockery, it seemed like I was talking with the Fred Weasley everyone in Gryffindor knew and talked so good about."This is going to sound weird but I think this is one of the few times you've called me 'Fred' since we met."Such a trivial comment almost put a little smile on my face but my lips stopped right in the midway and quickly faded away."I do it when you are not being an absolute prick and that doesn't happen often, does it?"A little silence got installed between us, and actually, it wasn't uncomfortable at all. It felt like we had said everything we had to say and now we just were sharing a short moment of comradeship and truce. For a strange reason, it felt easy to share this moment with him.He finished his cigarette and set it off by stepping on it. He took a deep breath and looked at me again, putting his hands in the pockets of his jeans."I'm sorry, Lilith, truly.""Thanks, Fred," I said in the kindest tone I ever spoke to him with.Then, he simply walked away slowly.My mind was still dizzy, my heart relaxed and I stopped noticing every beat of it.I took the last puff of my cigarette and left back to my room.When I finally got to the common room, some people from my house looked at me quite concerned but only Draco approached."I'm really sorry, Lilith," he said hugging me. "I know Diggory was one of your closest friends."I wasn't very in the mood for talking to anyone since I only wanted to pack my clothes to go back home now that classes were over, but since he seemed worried for me and I had the purpose of taking as much care of my friends as I could, I hugged him back and thanked him.Finally, inside my room, I found Liv crying over my bed with her luggage on the floor. Once our eyes met, I broke into tears and hugged her.After half an hour, I told Olivia everything that happened in her absence -of course, she almost fainted when I told her about Moody's real identity and how I confronted him - and had everything ready to leave to Snape's office and then to say 'goodbye' to Draco, Pauline and Liv herself."Where's your father taking you this Summer?" I asked her while grabbing my wand and opening the door to leave by her side."France. He wants to go to a little village in Alsace, but I don't know if I want to go now," she said in a soft voice with her cheeks red because of how much she had cried."Maybe it's good for you, Liv. Maybe it helps you to heal." I encouraged her after a while when we both were out of the common room. "I have to go to see Snape, but I'll be back in a bit, okay?"She nodded, "Be careful, Lilith. Don't annoy him more.""I can't promise anything."Five minutes later, I was waiting sat in Snape's office while he was at his desk in front of me."I still can't believe you dared to use -" he started, but I quickly finished him."You already told me once, I'm not deaf."He tightened his lips, "It was very irresponsible.""I don't give a fuck, are you going to drive me to the Arambella house or not? I don't feel like staying at Spinner's End.""You prefer to be at that ruined place before being at my house? You are just a capricious little girl! You should mature a bit, Lilith.""That ruined place is my home, Severus," I simply said, making my tone meaner and tougher."Then, the good news for you is that you are not going to Spinner's End this Summer. The bad news-""I already had enough bad news for today." I interrupted him."The bad news is that you'll have to stay at the House of the Order of the Phoenix for your own safety. If the Dark Lord is back, Barty Crouch Jr proved how interested they are in you and you cannot protect yourself against them on your own."I knew what the Order of the Phoenix was thanks to Snape's history classes when I was little but still, it surprised me why they would accept me."Where's the headquarters?""At 12 Grimmauld Place. In London.""Wait, isn't that the House of the Black family?""Unfortunately, yes. Its owner offered it himself since he can't be any more useful to the Order.""Who's the owner?" I asked genuinely confused."Sirius Black, of course," he replied with despise at that name."Are you really taking me, your relative, to your Nemesis' house?" What the fuck are you thinking, Snape?"That's the only place where you'd be safe and I personally asked Professor Lupin the favour to keep an eye on you.""You shouldn't have bothered him. I'm not his responsibility."It should be yours."You should know he accepted immediately, and he is the closest person in that house to earn my trust, except for Dumbledore himself, of course.""Dumbledore would send me to Death Eaters as a gift if that would mean Potter and the rest are safe. For the greater good. He would even put me a bow, perhaps.""Respect him, Lilith," he warned me."Make him earn my respect," I replied."You are not going to be alone there." he changed the topic. "The Weasleys and Granger are going to spend there the summer, the rest of the Order will visit very frequently.""Oh, great." I ironically said."Can you stop complaining? I'm saving your life.""You should have started to think about it earlier, Snape, not only when you want to."Tired of uselessly arguing with me, Snape simply clicked his tongue and made me leave his office.Dragging my luggage, I found all the students leaving their common rooms and saying 'goodbye' to each other. However, unlike previous years, the atmosphere of the place felt heavy and sad. Everyone was mourning Ced's lost and deadly scared of Him coming back.I quickly founded Liv and Pauline hugging, I waited for them to separate from each other so they'd have more privacy, to get closer to them."You are already leaving?" I asked getting by Liv's side, who still had watery eyes as she kept staring at Pauline with a look that seemed to demand and want something deeply being too scared to even word it."Yeah, Madame Maxine wants to leave as soon as possible," she replied with a shaky voice. She swallowed hard and hugged me. Of course, I hugged her back tightly. "I'm really sorry about what happened. But I wanted to say to you that I'm so grateful for you two. Thanks for being such a good friend in so little time. You can't imagine how much I love you and don't you dare to think just because I'll be in France you will get rid of me."A little chuckle escaped from my mouth."Thank you, girl." I emphasised the 'you'. "You have become such a big support for me. I'd say you deserve the world, but it's shit, you deserve so much better, Pauline."A girl from Beauxbatons arrived and said to Pauline something in French to what she nodded."I have to go." she sighed.The three of us melted into a big hug and I could feel the tears hitting the back of my eyes.Oh, Merlin. Not again, please...Pauline separated and started walking away, waving at us. Once she was out of our sights, Olivia started crying on my shoulder."Oh, Lilith. I'm gonna miss her so much." she sobbed.I hugged her."Me too, Liv. But we are to keep in touch with her, you can be sure of that.""I'm gonna miss you too," she said sobbing even harder. "Terribly""I'm gonna miss you more," I murmured, letting a single tear run down my cheek. "Please, try to enjoy your time in France as much as possible."In the distance, I could see Snape making a gesture showing an invisible clock in his hand. I had to leave already but I certainly didn't want to. Against my will, I forced myself to separate from Liv and walk in Snape's direction.Fuck, this summer was going to be tough...

Snape and I arrived at the Black's House two hours later, after a long broom flight since he considered it better not to let the Ministry know the location, for the safety of the Order. Being back in London after that surrealistic year felt weird, the city didn't change a bit but it felt like nothing was the same nor would ever be. Once we entered, a long hallway received us, some voices could be heard from inside the rooms and I could feel my heart hitting hard against my chest. I was literally venturing into the lion's den. Without exchanging a word, Snape walked in front of me, silently indicating me to follow him.While we were walking, I gave a little gaze to the portraits hung and one in special, which was covered, called my attention but when I felt Snape grabbing the sleeve of my leather jacket and dragging me to keep walking, I returned my eyes to the hallway. We finally got to the kitchen and I couldn't help but keep my eyes looking to the floor. I was too shy to even lift my eyes and honestly, my boots seemed very interesting at that moment."Here she is," Snape spoke for the first time.I encouraged myself to give a discreet look to the room and found all eyes on me so I couldn't low mine again. The dining table was huge and almost fully occupied. I recognized Ronald, Ginevra Weasley and the twins, accompanied by their unconditional friend Granger. I guessed the adult ginger man who seemed very nice but to be in his own world was their father and the lady who was cooking but still with her eyes on me - not very kind ones though - was their mother, Molly Weasley, neé Prewett. Shit.As head of the table, I saw a man who seemed to be in his 40s, brown long curly hair, piercing eyes that were analyzing me with an undecipherable look, and well-dressed. I bet he was Sirius Black."Welcome, Lilith. We were waiting for you." Remus Lupin talked with his usual kind smile, sitting next to Black."Hello, professor." I smiled back at him knowing he was the only person in that house who made me feel comfortable. In front of him, there was a witch with purple hair and blue eyes who was looking at me very curious but still in a nice way."She's your niece?" the curly-haired man spoke without addressing me directly. "She looks nothing like you.""Lucky me then," I whispered in a low voice, gaining Snape looking daggers at me. Oops, maybe it wasn't so low."Whatever." he started changing the topic. "I have already done my part. I have to go back to the school since professor Dumbledore requires me. Lupin, can I trust you to keep an eye on Lilith?""Of course Dumbledore is always your priority," I said before being able to control myself. Rolling my eyes and crossing my arms. "And I told you, you shouldn't bother Professor Lupin. I'm not his responsibility. I can take care of myself.""No, you can't. Now, shut up." Snape replied in a mumble."You are not bothering, Lilith." Lupin intervened. " I know you're a very capable witch who can manage on her own but I'm sure you will be safer here and I have no trouble at all to be taking care of you.""Thank you, Professor," I replied feeling a bit more confident. If only Severus acted like that..."Wow, your niece has a temper, Snivellus!" Black smirked.I couldn't help but chuckle and had to turn around to hide my laugh."Alright, that's enough. I'm leaving." Snape announced starting to walk away to the front door. I felt a heavyweight deep in my guts, I couldn't believe he was actually leaving me here on my own. This was even worse than the Arambella house..."Come! Sit by my side!" the witch with purple hair talked as soon as the door closed.I obeyed with everyone's eyes still on me, I looked at Fred for a second and his eyes shown a mixture of shock and disbelief. Mrs Weasley put some food over the table and gave a quick gaze to her children who interpreted it as a signal to start eating and talk between themselves. This is a bit awkward..."I'm Tonks, by the way." the girl by my side said. She was probably just a bit older than me and the single person that spoke to me, apart from Lupin, since I arrived."Lilith," I replied trying to sound nice. I needed someone to speak to in this house in order to not go mental."I was told you were in Year 6, did you have to face the fake Mad-Eye?" she continued while serving some food on her plate and when she finished, she put some in mine as well."I did, yeah, it was awful.""But you managed anyway to deal with him." Lupin intervened. "Lilith is one of the best students I had in my class but she doesn't believe me because she thinks being a Slytherin stops her." he continued now directing his words to Tonks. I looked at her a bit concerned thinking that her kindness would fade away once she knew my house, even though she was brave enough to talk to me knowing who my uncle was. She looked at me at first surprised but then a huge smile appeared on her face."That's really cool! My mum used to be the best Slytherin in DADA." she announced while winking at me, guessing what was previously going around my mind."You know what? Your uncle told me you skipped some of the DADA classes, would you like me to give you some of my notes from it while I'm here? Maybe you can use them for your N.E.W.Ts" Lupin offered while eating, looking at my untouched dish.I took the fork in my hand and tried the food for the first time. It was incredibly good, but my stomach didn't felt good yet because of the anxiety I went through in so little time. Having some moments to focus on my favourite subject instead of drowning myself in misery sounded like a great idea."Sure, I'd love that, professor."He shook his head with a smile on his face. "Call me Remus, we are not at Hogwarts anymore.""So, how's your relationship with Snape?" Sirius Black intervened."Sirius..." Remus called him out giving him a severe look. Black only looked at him with puppy eyes."We are too different." I simply responded. "By the way, thank you for having me in your house, Mr Black. I wish I weren't such a bother.""It's okay, kid. And my name is Sirius."Then, the attention focused on the Weasleys who were having their own conversation."Mum, where's Lilith going to sleep?" Fred asked looking at Mrs Weasley, who at the only mention of my name, darkness invaded her eyes."I don't know, dear. That's Sirius' concern," she replied trying to sound kind to her own son but with a subtle bitterness in her tone.After a deadly silence that made me want to literally vanish, someone talked."She can sleep with me," Hermione said in a stuttery voice. "There are two beds and it has enough space."Minutes later, everyone got up and started to leave the dining table and when I was about to follow Tonks outside, Lupin stopped me, he opened my hand and put something in it. A little piece of chocolate."Here, have this. And I hope tomorrow during breakfast you eat something, young lady, you can't go during the day without nutrients.""Come with me," Granger said, talking to me for the first time since we met. In any other situation, I'd have made a joke but I didn't want to ruin the moment. As we were going upstairs, I felt someone grabbing my wrist. Fred Weasley stopped my way and got in the same step as me."What are you doing here?""Snape wants me to stay here, he considers my home too dangerous for myself.""Why?""Because he thinks the Death Eaters will come after me.""What? Why he thinks that?"Wrong question, long story."I'm sorry but that's none of your business.""Put the claws down, Arambella. We are in a truce.""Are we? Until when Weasley? Until you get tired of behaving as a decent human?""Maybe..."I clicked my tongue and took my wrist off his grip to continue upstairs. Wandering through the corridors, I finally found Hermione's room. It was a huge dorm with two big beds that left a very good space for our personal stuff. Luckily, thanks to magic, all my belongings were already there and I only had to take out my pyjama.I changed my clothes right there in front of Granger, who I noticed was trying to avoid looking at me, a bit flustered, making me smile a little bit. Being so tired because of the long and awful day, I got into bed and swallowed all the sorrow and sadness I had been dealing with. Normally, my dorm is the place where I get my emotions off my chest and let myself cry without nobody watching me unless it is Olivia, but being accompanied took that option off the table."Thanks for sharing your dorm, Hermione." I sincerely said, to which she nodded. "Good night."Tomorrow morning I had too many things to do.✵ ✵ ✵I woke up as soon as the sunlight entered the dorm, while Hermione kept sleeping, I showered in our shared bathroom and put on clean clothes without making any noise so she could keep resting. I needed to go to the city to call Olivia and to buy some cigarettes. It would be well for me to have a little walk on my own.I put my wand in my bag, just in case I'd need it, next to my wallet. I thanked myself in my mind for being a half-blood since I always kept muggle money with me.Downstairs, no one seemed to be up yet so I took a little paper and a pen from my bag and wrote:I'm going out for a little walk near Hyde Park and to buy cigarettes. I'll be back at midday. -Lilith A.Leaving the note on the dining table, I got out and breathed the cold morning air of London. Feeling a bit more relieved, I started walking. Maybe the adults would think I was being irresponsible for going out on my own, but none of the Death Eaters had seen me in a long time, I had my wand with me and I certainly needed to be alone.I spent two hours going down the city as I did every summer when I had the opportunity to come to London. It was one of my favourite places. I got into one of the phone cabinets and enchanted it to let me call Liv. She responded soon and a little tear threatened to leave my eyes as soon as I heard her voice. Fuck, not even 24 hours have passed since the last time I saw her...I told her how my day went with every single detail and reminded her like seven or eight times how much I missed her. To change the bitter topic, she talked to me about the place in France where she was staying and how she already planned to visit Pauline in Toulouse, where she lived. I felt really happy for her when I noticed she was calmer and safe. Now, more than ever, I wanted to feel Olivia as close to me as possible. After a long phone call, we have to say 'goodbye' to each other against our wills. Still, with a bit of heaviness in my heart, I kept walking.I got my cigs and a lighter and went straight to Hyde Park where I sat under a tree to enjoy one of the cigarettes. It was still nine in the morning so the streets were only occupied by people who were going to work. I observed the Muggles, how would it feel having such banal responsibilities like going to work in an office, or going to a normal high school? How could they be so ignorant about the huge threat the wizarding world was facing? If only I could disconnect from my own world like that...be a muggle for one day."Here you are!" a masculine voice spoke by my side. I lifted my eyes and found Fred Weasley looking directly at me, with his hands in the pocket of his worn-out jeans, wearing an oversized white t-shirt with some inscription I couldn't read and a checked flannel shirt. He was looking like any other normal muggle teenager."What do you want, Weasley? Are you following me?" I said standing up since him being so tall while I was sat in the grass made me feel a little bit intimidated."Actually, I am. I've been looking for you for an entire hour. You know it's not very clever of you to go out in the middle of London when apparently, you could be an objective for the Death Eaters. I wonder if this is why you are not in Ravenclaw.""Why are you following me? I left a note saying I'd be back at midday. And I'm being careful, last time Death Eaters saw me, I was 13. Also, they are not going to attack me in the centre of the most crowded city in the country.""My mother ordered me to." he simply responded. "She was the one who found the note and quickly woke up all of us.""Well, obviously, she didn't do it because she cares about me. Did she order you that because she doesn't trust me?" I questioned with an exhausted voice. It was no longer annoying or offensive, it was exhausting. "I bet she thinks I'm going to meet the Death Eaters by myself and tell them where the headquarters is."Fred took a few seconds before replying."Can you blame her? She would do the same with Snape.""I'm not Snape. I've been trying to say it for the last six years.""Whatever, the thing is that, for now on, me or anyone else from the Order would have to accompany you if you want to go out."I groaned showing how in disagree I was with that. I was used to enjoying my moments alone and having my personal space but having someone following me felt like that space was being violated. I didn't like that. Not a bit.I started walking again, back in the headquarters direction, with Fred Weasley a good couple of steps in front of me without exchanging a single word.This summer was going to be horrible.

Time kept going and suddenly, it was already my second week in the Black House. July was starting, summer in England made its entrance, and very little news came. Four days a week, when Remus was here, we practised some of the advanced enchants and talk about our stuff. I never thought I'd be talking with a professor about details of my personal life, but he was one of the few people I could talk to. Also, I became a lot closer to Tonks, who every time she was there, took me out to town to have a couple of beers and enjoy life as a normal teenager and surprisingly, I also started to talk with Hermione. Since we had to share rooms, on my third day she caught me looking at one of the pictures I had with Liv and Cedric, from one day we met during vacations in the summer of the third year, and the expression on my face must have been devastating because she sat next to me and offered to listen to me and try to help me if I needed it, from that moment on, we had some good chats before going to sleep.I kept going to call Liv once every two days in disagreement with Mrs Weasley who considered it too dangerous, but I was still allowed to because Black thought it would be good for me. Remus, who was the one with authority over me, agreed with Sirius on letting me go out but also agreed with Mrs Wealsey on having me being accompanied by someone else. Poor George was always in charge of me and had always to follow me around London because obviously no one would trust Fred to take care of me and Little Weasley and Hermione were also in danger so there wasn't anybody else."Can I ask you a question, Remus?" I started while sitting on the desk and lightning my cigarette. The windows were wide open and Sirius let Remus and I practise on the third floor of the building since it only had studios."Sure," He replied while putting vinyl in his gramophone. Our class of the day was over, so as usual, we simply sat there, resting and chatting."Why does Sirius accepted to have me in here? He doesn't like Snape and I can't really collaborate with anything of the Order."Remus seemed to think his response."I think you remind him to his brother Regulus. He was also in Slytherin, but he succumbed to his parents' ideas to join the Death Eaters, when he wanted to give a step back it was too late and they, well, they had their revenge. He was only eighteen years old." he said softening his voice, "I think that even though Sirius hates Snape, he's capable to see that you are nothing like him, that you are just a kid carrying with your parents' crimes.""I wish it wasn't like that. I wonder how would I be if life had treated me a little bit better.""You wouldn't be yourself, Lilith. The moments, good or bad, in our life shape our personality and who we are. Even though if they hurt you, they also helped you to know yourself." a brief silence imposed in the room. "If you don't mind me, I have also a question for you. It's about your uncle so if you don't want to answer it's okay."Snape wasn't the kind of topic I wanted to talk about with anyone but since he responded to my question, I agreed."Go on.""What happened between you two for being so distant? I mean, I know Severus is not the most affectionate person but I remember how proud he used to be of you when you were born and now, forgive me, but now it looks like you two are strangers.""Nothing happened, Remus. Absolutely nothing. When my mother was put in prison, he started to change his attitude towards me. I was only three years old but he put me in the Arambella mansion to be taken care of by the elves and visited me twice a month, he tried to make me think that nothing happened but his encounters were every time colder and distant so we got to this point. I know he doesn't love me because I look like my father but he thinks I'm gonna act like my mother. He's scared that he would disappoint Dumbledore for having me follow Circe's path. That's it."Remus took a deep breath and looked at me with pity."I'd say I'm surprised but I'm not. Severus has always been judgy before knowing the facts but he shouldn't be so fast to condone you especially when he was so fast to flirt with the Dark Arts in the past. I told you this once and I would tell you again, your family doesn't define you. What your mother did was terrible and you need to know it, but it's not your fault. You were just a child with no father and a non mentally stable mother, and the way you deal with it right now shows what an incredibly strong woman you are. Every person close to you on this planet would be proud of you and if Snape isn't, then I am."The tears piled up in my eyes and I made a huge effort to control them. That was the most beautiful thing an adult ever told me, Liv always told me how proud she was of me but having someone like Remus, who created a safe space for me in this house and who kept saying how I was a good person even though he didn't know me as much as Liv, saying something like that really melted my heart. For a moment, I felt like if a real paternal figure was talking to me."Thank you, Remus," I said with a trembling voice.He smiled at me and was about to add something but Sirius Black appeared at the open door and knocked, calling our attention."Hey, uhm, Moony, Molly wants to have a word with the kid, she says she needs the two of you right now in the kitchen. Dumbledore called. There is some news you need to know." he said looking straight to Remus."We're going right now, Padfoot. Thanks for telling us." Remus answered, giving Sirius a shiny and smiley look.Wiping off the little tears in the corners of my eyes, we got down in a minute and went to the kitchen where Mr and Mrs Weasley were talking between each other in little whispers, with the concern pretty clear in their faces. We took a seat next to them and Mrs Weasley took a deep breath, I could distinguish her watery eyes even though I was next to Remus."Dumbledore called an hour ago." Mr Weasley started, grabbing his wife's hand. "A group of Death Eaters tried to escape. They almost did it because a group of Dementors allowed them, they failed because the Minister himself was visiting the prison."The air left my lungs. This was the only thing I was afraid of at the moment."Who are they?""Bellatrix Lestrange, Dolohov, Rockwood and...Circe Snape." he continued, avoiding to look at me. Mrs Weasley sobbed harder and also kept her eyes away from me.Fuck no, not her again.Chills covered my body from up to down and my mouth became drier, I sighed hardly and felt every inch of my body heavy."You shouldn't allow the girl to go out these days, Remus. If they get out or have any contacts, she's going to be their objective and they could follow her to here. They are interested in the kid, especially her." Mrs Wealsey and I knew she was referring to me.I looked at Sirius and Remus terrified of having the possibility to lose my little freedom."Please no, I'll be careful. I promise, but please don't take that from me."Remus looked at me with worry in his eyes."I'm sorry, Lilith, but Molly is right, you shouldn't go out at least for this week. Then, we can talk about more protection you can use.""But they didn't escape and how I'm going to talk with Olivia?" I asked noticing how my voice was trembling. Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry..."They almost did, I understand that you are young and you want to enjoy your summer but be responsible, Lilith. I promise it would not last too long." he continued, ignoring my watery eyes."I agree with Remus. She won't be going anywhere in these seven days." Sirius talked directly with Molly.I understood that it could be dangerous for me and all the Order but I also kept feeling as if I was nothing else but a piece in their game like I was a pawn in their play they were waiting to sacrifice in order to keep the king safe.They all started to stand up to attend their own business, Remus put his hand over mine."I'll send an owl to Xenophillus Lovegood to let him know that you would not be able to talk to Olivia for these days but that you are safe. I'll also ask about her and tell you as soon as I get his response. I know you worry about her."I clenched my jaw but nodded. He didn't understand how much Liv meant to me and how lonely I felt without her. Not speaking with her in so many days was something I wasn't sure to be able to accept."I know that you smoke, if you need cigarettes these days, I have a big supply of them in the main office on the third floor. You can have them." Black spoke without directly looking at me."Thank you, sir." I simply said, standing up and going straight to the stairs to get to the dorm. I opened the door and almost threw myself to the bed, ignoring Hermione who was putting her shoes on."Is everything okay?" she asked a bit shy."No, nothing is." I dramatically said, speaking against my pillow. "Death Eaters tried to escape from Azkaban and now I can't go out for a week.""What? Why?""Because one of them was my mother.""Oh, then, perhaps is best to stay under the protection of the house for a few days, Lilith. For your own safety.""I need my freedom, Hermione. That's the only thing I truly have." I said grabbing a cushion and squeezing it between my arms, like a teddy bear."Sometimes we need to sacrifice things, but I'm really sorry. I wish it wasn't like this.""Believe me, you don't more than I do."✵ ✵ ✵The sun was still behind the buildings and the light was very poor. Completely in silence, I grabbed my boots and a denim jacket and abandoned the room, leaving Hermione sleeping. I was planning to go to the cabinet on the corner of the street before anyone woke up to talk to Liv. I wouldn't be out for more than half an hour and if no one saw me, no one would know.Down, on the first floor, the entire place was deadly quiet so I picked up my wand to make sure I could cast a silent spell while I was at the door. When I was about to grab the door's knob, I felt two hands grabbing my waist and dragging me. I couldn't help but gasp when I noticed how I was in one of the larders, with very little space and a tiny light. With my back glued to the wall, I found a couple of familiar brown eyes."What are you doing?""Where are you going?" Fred Weasley asked at the same time as me, with an arrogant and ironic smile.I remained quiet for half a minute, waiting for him to talk first, but he was too busy staring at me as if we were in a war of looks."I was going out to the phone cabinet, I need to talk with Olivia." I started with a soft voice when the nervousness in my body surpassed me, pretending it was the most common thing.I was internally praying that he didn't know about my new rules, but the suspicious and amused shine in his eyes told me otherwise."Oh, really? Have you forgotten you can't go out?""I can't go out on my own.""No, you can't go out, in any way," he stated. "Mum told me to keep an eye on you and said it pretty clear.""Oh, now you want to keep me controlled? I'm capable enough to take care of myself, thank you." I said ironically."You sure? 'Cause, it doesn't look like." he imitated my tone. "Are you aware of the fact that if any of the Death Eaters find you, you are risking the entire Order's safety? That's not very nice of you.""I'm only going out for half an hour! And the cabinet is on the corner of this street! I only want to talk to Olivia.""I think it's not clicking, you are not going anywhere, dear."I looked at him arrogantly and with the rage accumulating in my guts. My plan was falling..."Are you stopping me, Weasley?""You can be sure I will," he replied coming closer to me."What are you going to do? Because right now it looks like you want to kiss me and we've been in this situation before." I whispered.He chuckled softly."I don't want to kiss you," he said, sure of himself, lowering his voice making me have chills that I tried by all meanings to cover."I bet you don't," I said and then, my eyes went to his mouth and felt how I bite my lower lip.His breath became heavier and his eyes repeated my action. I felt the fire covering every inch of my skin and I forgot everything else in the world existed but him. The effect he had on me was like a drug, tempting me, and against what my brain wanted, my body was asking to try it.Suddenly, he caught my face with both of his hands at each of my cheeks and kissed me passionately. The feeling of his lips over mine unblocked the memory in my head of the last time and the tingles concentrated between my legs. The way his lips moved against mine made me weak and my mind went completely dizzy. He moved one of his hands to my waist, while he glued my body to his, making me feel how his chest was violently going up and down with every breath he took between the kiss and took the other hand to my neck... I took my hands to his hair and softly bit his lower lip to what he responded with a soft moan that made me feel the wetness growing.Fuck.Once again, he was sinfully kissing me, having me right there at his feet, making my blood burn in my veins and desiring him more than anything else in the world. His mouth moved from my lips to my jaw and then to the space in my neck that was free from his hand, where he started to suck, bite and kiss. The heat from his hand over my skin through the shirt, my hips glued to his, feeling him completely, and his expert lips over me, made me feel my soul and the little sense in me abandoning my body and making me moan hoarsely. Moving his lips back to mine, he kissed me tiredly, like if was trying to drink the last drops of me, and of course, I let him have everything he wanted because his only touch took me to heaven.We finally separated and looked surprised at each other's eyes. I recomposed myself and gave him a feline smile."So you didn't want to kiss me, huh?" I said in a little whisper next to his ear, opening the door behind him and walking away before he could say anything.Wow, that was intense.

I went straight to my dorm to change back to my comfy clothes to pretend in front of Hermione I just got out of the shower. Five minutes after I entered our shared bathroom, I heard Hermione standing up from her bed so I got out."Good morning," I said trying to appear as if I was still a bit sleepy."Hey, I had a weird dream. I felt like someone was walking all over the room, did you feel anything?" she asked, grabbing her clothes to get into the shower."Sorry, no idea."She shrank her shoulders and got into the bathroom, not giving it more importance. I took my wand and a notebook to have the class of the day with professor Lupin. The pages were full of sketches and little notes since we rarely practised theory. I got out of my room and walked down to the kitchen where Mrs Weasley was preparing breakfast while George and Sirius were sat at the table, still a bit sleepy."Mrs Weasley, can I help you?" I offered myself when I saw how the poor woman was barely managing by herself while those two were almost sleeping over the table."No, kid, it is okay," she said with a cold tone while cleaning the countertop."I insist, I can prepare the coffee." I grabbed the coffee pot and started preparing it. When I was at the Arambella mansion, I used to share the housework with the elves, even though they didn't like the idea too much.Once she saw how I was doing it correctly she tightened her lips."Thank you" she simply said, as if it pained her to say it.I serve myself a cup of black coffee and some food and sat while re-reading my notes from the previous classes. When I was already almost finishing, Remus entered the room with messy hair and sleepy eyes and greeted everyone while his hand rested for exactly three seconds on Sirius' shoulder, who blushed slightly almost unnoticeable. I had to force myself to hide a little smile."Lilith, darling, would you like to go to the studio and start the class now? I'd take my coffee there." Remus said standing by my side with a kind smile. His eyes went from mine to the notebook where a little portrait of him was next to the notes I took last week. "That's really beautiful! I didn't know you could draw.""I'm full of surprises." I joked, standing up to clean the dishes I used and leaving the room.The class went as fast as all of them. I loved to have Remus as a professor again and I felt how my interest in the subject was growing with every class. After an entire hour, we finally stopped and Remus sat at his desk, leaving his feet hanging."How've you been doing, Lilith?" he started, taking a chocolate bar from his pocket and offering me a piece.I took it and thanked him."I'm fine, still missing my little walks in the town.""Well, we didn't get any other news and since you are behaving so well, perhaps you can go out before than expected," he said with his typical smile.Merlin, this poor man had his expectations too high on me..."That would be great, Remus. I really miss talking with Liv even though it has only been a day."Wait, if Remus didn't know anything about my almost escape, that means Fred didn't mention anything... weird."Have you taken any of the packs Padd...I mean, Sirius offered you?" he continued, blushing a little bit at the mention of Black."Yes, I did. In fact, do you mind if I light one now?""Go on," he said. "I might go to the kitchen to help Molly to prepare lunch."At that moment, Sirius appeared on the door and his eyes brighten as soon as he pictured Remus.My attention focused on them.Fuck, why didn't I learn the popcorn spell?"Moony, Molly is calling you in the kitchen, she says she will need your help if you don't mind," he spoke with a soft voice. "By the way, you left this in...Uhm, the kitchen." he handled Remus his tie, I looked at them with my eyebrows frowned but a huge smile. Why would Remus forget his tie in the kitchen?Remus looked at the piece of clothing with his eyes opened widely and quickly, grabbed it to put it in the pocket of his trousers."Uhm, thank you, I was about to go down to help Molly. Thanks for telling me anyway." Remus' voice trembled a little bit while waving at us, walking to the door.Sirius and I ended up alone in the room, looking right there where Remus just walked."Well..." Black started looking at me. "Do you like those cigarettes?""Yeah," I answered still amused because of the scene I just watched."Can I have one?""Sure." I handed him the pack and we both walked to the big window so the ashes wouldn't fall in the just cleaned floor."So...are you feeling comfortable here? Your uncle called this morning to ask how you were doing."I sighed."I'm fine, you can tell him he can stop pretending he cares about me.""To be honest, he's one of the biggest morons I've seen in my life," he replied, breathing the smoke, "but I'm glad you're comfortable, kid. I prejudged you thinking you'd be like Snivellus but you're nothing like him.""Thank you, sir. You are one of the few people apart from Remus who seems to notice that.""Oh, yes," a huge dreamy smile appeared on his face. "Moony always sees the best in everyone, you know? He can't help but think that everyone deserves to be saved because he keeps thinking that, deep down, everyone is as good as him."I smile grew on my face as well listening to how he talked about Lupin."He's very special to you, isn't he?""Yes, but no in the way you're thinking little girl," he told me off, joking."Yeah, sure," I said sarcastically. "I know my own kind, Sirius. I know you are the kind to go both ways but don't worry, my mouth is shut." I said finishing my cig and winking at him. He simply laughed while shaking his head."I should go down to help with lunch, but I'll see you later." I grabbed my notebook and walked out, leaving Sirius taking the last puffs from his cigarette.While going down the stairs, I took a quick gaze to my notebook and saw a sketch I didn't notice when I did. His eyes, his messy hair, his mischievous smile... I drew Fred Weasley. Closing the notebook and noticing how the blood was accumulating in my cheeks before the memory of this morning, I was in the corridor of my bedroom when a tall figure collided with me.I felt my shirt going wet and a couple of brown eyes watching me, surprised."Oh, Merlin, I'm really sorry, Lilith. I didn't see you." George Weasley apologised, with a glass in his hand, empty, because all the water was on my shirt.

 bad luck appearing as usual."No, don't worry. It's my fault, I was daydreaming." I said trying to keep the wet fabric from my skin. Fuck, I'd have to change my shirt. "I'm sorry, George. I have to change my clothes.""I'm sorry again," he said with puppy eyes while he continued walking.I changed my direction to my empty dorm. I took off my shirt staying in my black bra and my skirt. Fortunately, it didn't get wet. I went straight to the wardrobe and started looking for a clean shirt in my pile of clothes until I found one that was pretty similar to my previous one.When I was using the dry part of the other shirt to dry the little drops of water over my breast, the door opened."Lilith, my mother wants you now in the ki..." Fred started but interrupted himself when he saw in what situation he caught me. His hand kept in the door's knob and his mouth opened widely as well as his eyes, which went up and down across my body, covering each inch in my breast, like if he was trying to memorise every part of my skin.Bad day to chose to wear my best lingerie.I was so shocked I didn't cover myself so I was there, almost naked, only covered by my bra and by a tight short skirt that was pretty much up my knees, just a few hours later from our intense kiss in which we almost fucked each other's mouth.His breathing got heavier and he swallowed hard but suddenly went back to himself and turned around, facing the wall."As soon as you put on your shirt, please, go down to the kitchen." he started with a deeper voice. "Also, for the sake of everyone's eyes, you shouldn't be only in your bra.""I'm not the one bumping in other's room without knocking first. And it's not my fault that your brother clashed with me, spilling his glass of water over my white shirt.""Whatever, hurry up, everyone's waiting down for you," he responded leaving the room and closing the door hard behind him.I quickly put on the clean shirt just in case anyone else had the idea to appear in my room even though anyone else in this house would have been a better option to see me in that situation than Fred Weasley. Why couldn't have been Hermione or Weasley girl? No, of course, it had to be him.I finally got out and went straight to the kitchen. Remus was talking vividly with a smiley Molly while Sirius observed the two of them with a smile on his face, George was eating some of the food without his mother noticing. Ronald and Hermione were sitting at the table reading the Prophet, next to Fred, who as soon as I entered the place, looked down with his eyebrows raised. Pretending not to care about our encounter, I passed behind him without giving him a single look and positioned myself next to Remus, who greeted me smiling.As I was helping to prepare the food, I could feel Fred's eyes over me and I knew it was him because of the damn way my body reacted, making my skin more sensitive and feeling a heat concentrating in between my legs. Fuck, not now please, it has been a whole month since the last time I touched myself...When I finished helping, I grabbed my plate and sat in the only free seat, which, of course, had to be the one in front of Fred. As soon as I sat, I felt his eyes piercing me from my eyes to the neckline of my shirt. I could see how a wild bright appeared in them and how he tried to hide a mischievous smile. I looked down and because my bra wasn't fully dry, it was showing through the white shirt, making it tighter to my body.He took his eyes from me and focused on the conversation his twin was having with Sirius.Deeply, I knew the fucker was enjoying it.

And I can't say I wasn't doing it as well.

"Ron is an idiot!" Hermione shouted, banging the door of our room behind her. I put down the book I was reading while looking at her, surprised. It was early in the morning and because of the little incident from yesterday with Weasley, I spent all day and night inside the dorm reading again Liv's favourite muggle novel."What did he do this time?"She sat frustrated in my bed next to me."He seems to constantly forget that I'm a girl," she sighed, furrowing her eyebrows. "I don't want to see him for the rest of the day.""Well, you can spend the day with me if you want 'cause I don't pretend to see any of the Weasleys either," I replied, laying down. "I'm not doing anything interesting, though."We were hanging out together and started painting our nails, talking as if we had been friends for a long time when someone knocked on the door. Sirius wanted to show us the muggle phone he had found in one of the studios to let me call Liv.I looked at Hermione, excited, and she nodded her head, smiling.Immediately, we both got out of our dorm. I tangled my arm with Hermione's and we followed Sirius all over the corridor, passing in front of the main living room where all the boys were, giving us their attention as we passed. We finally got into the studio and what I saw there, made me almost jump with pure joy. It was a muggle old telephone, probably from the 70s but it looked like it had been so well treated that could work perfectly.Hermione and I looked at each other and almost threw ourselves to the phone to make it work. Sirius left us alone and we started figuring it out. After two hours, we finally made it."Wizards... they have all the power in their hands but don't know how to turn on a simple telephone." Hermione sighed, sitting on the floor with her legs crossed."The advantages of being half-blood and a muggle-born," I replied, remembering Liv's number.After a whole eternal minute, Liv responded."Hello?" she said softly. I felt a huge joy covering me from up to down."Liv! Oh Merlin, finally! How are you?""Lilith!" her voice trembled a little bit as if she was crying but at the same time smiling. "I've missed you lots, sister. I received the owl and was deadly scared something happened to you or worse, you were risking yourself..."The bitch knew me so well..."I'm fine, Liv. I just complained because of how badly I wanted to talk to you. It has been five days since the last time we talked. I've missed you so much, but I'm not as alone as I thought I'd be." I said looking at Hermione and smiling at her. "I'm becoming friends with Hermione, do you mind if I cast a spell so she can hear our conversation?""Oh, really? That's great, Hermione always seemed so nice! And, of course, go on!"I took off my wand and made a quick spell so now Liv's voice could be heard aloud."Hello, Olivia! Is nice to hear from you!" Hermione greeted, coming closer to me and the phone."Hi, Hermione! I'm happy to hear from you too! Thanks for taking care of the daredevil bitch of my best friend, is she being too annoying?" Olivia joked."Fuck off, Lovegood!" I talked back while Hermione was laughing."Not at all! At least she gives a bit of life to this boring house.""You hear that, you bitch? I'm the life of the party, take that." I continued making both of them giggle. "Where are you at the moment, Liv?""I'm in Toulouse!"I opened my eyes widely and gave Hermione a mischievous smile."Oh, really? And what are you doing in there, Lovegood? That's pretty far from Alsace." I teased her.Olivia sighed."I'm visiting a certain witch...""Only visiting?""Oh, no, we did way more than that!""OH MERLIN, OLIVIA MARIE LOVEGOOD, YOU HAD SEX?!"Olivia burst into laughter while Hermione intercalated her eyes from me to the phone, shocked."Yes," Liv said softly, still recovering from her laugh. "And, God, it was so good! I've never been with a girl like Pauline.""Wait, what? Is she talking about your friend Pauline Bélier from Beauxbatons?" Hermione asked, genuinely confused."Yes, she is. Both of them fancied each other since the beginning but never dared to tell me anything or try to do something. They waited until summer.""Well, how could we? You were always with us, Lilith. It's not like I'd fuck her in front of you." Liv giggled."Well, thank you, Olivia, I love you too! But you could have told me and I'd have let you two alone!""Nah, being honest now, I don't know from where I took the confidence to kiss her yesterday but, it just happened, and now I've been in her bed all night.""I'm really happy for you two, Liv. Absolutely. Is she there? I'd like to say hello unless she's busy with you while you talk to me which I hope she isn't, you dirty bitch.""Ew, Lilith! She's at the kitchen but, wait, I'll tell her to come in." Liv laughed."I didn't know Olivia fancied women..." Hermione whispered with a surprised face.I could notice how Liv and I burst into laughter at the same time, apparently, Liv could hear everything that happened in the room because of the spell."Oh, Hermione, both Lilith and I like women, love." Liv started with a kind voice but also as if it was the most obvious thing ever. "It's just that I only fancy women unlike Lilith, whose lack of taste makes her like men too."I chuckled and noticed how Hermione kept the same surprised look on her face."Mon Dieu! Lilith! How are you?" Pauline's voice appeared."Pauline, dear, I'm good! But not as good as you shagging my best mate!" I joked winking at Hermione who took a hand to her mouth to shut her laugh."Okay, fair enough." Pauline chuckled. "I'm so happy to hear from you, girl! You sound better than the last time.""I'm much better! I'm healing slowly but I'm healing."The four of us continued talking for almost three hours until Mrs Weasley came to the office to tell us lunch was ready. Since Hermione didn't want to see Ronald yet, we picked our food and went to the library to eat it there while investigating the section of muggle novels which, sadly, was almost empty.Hermione and I spent the entire afternoon together as well and when the sun already disappeared behind the buildings, we walked together to our dorm in between lots of giggling and jokes.Each of us got inside of our beds and looked at each other."Thanks for this day, Hermione. I hope we can repeat it soon." I honestly thanked her."No, thank you! I really needed another girl to talk to apart from Ginny or Mrs Weasley. This has been by far one of the best days of this summer.""I'm happy to hear that, you are welcomed to hang out with me whenever you want as long as you know I'm a bit of a bad influence." I joked.A little silence installed between us and Hermione passed her tongue by her lower lip, like if she was wondering whether to speak or not."I-I have a question." she finally dared to talk, stuttering. "You've been with girls before, right?"Oh, wow. I wasn't expecting that."What do you mean?" I asked, pretending to be clueless.She took a deep breath and slightly flustered."I mean, you have kissed girls and...you have had sex with them, right?""Oh, yes, I have." a little chuckle escaped from my mouth. "Actually my first kiss was in a muggle club when I was fourteen, with three girls of my age, including Olivia, at the same time. Then, Liv got busy with one of them and I got busy with the other one."Hermione looked at me with her eyes opened widely and I had to hide my smile. Her face was redder than ever."Why did you want to know that?""B-because I was w-wondering, how did you know you like girls too?"Merlin! The Granger girl wasn't that boring after all."Well, I always felt like I wasn't only attracted to boys so one day, I decided to try with a girl and I liked it. As simple as that.""Only that?""Yes, some people find their tastes differently, but for me, I have to try to know if I like it."She choked a little bit with her own breath and started playing with her nails."Hermione?" I called her."Yes?""Would you like to try what it feels like to kiss a girl? Because we are friends, I can show you as Liv did with me. She had more experience when I tried and we are still friends and nothing more."Hermione sighed hard and turned around to look at me directly in the eyes."Yes, please! I need to stop being so confused."I chuckled softly and stood up from my bed. I was only wearing the top and the short of my summer pyjama and I felt her eyes over me.The devilish part of my mind jumped with joy. This was funny...I sat by her side and looked at her as kindly and comforting as I could while biting my lip then, I put my left hand on her cheek and caressed carefully, noticing how she swallowed hard."Ready?" I asked her in a whisper. She nodded putting her hand on my forearm.Slowly, I got closer to her mouth and trapped her lips in mine. I started patiently waiting for her to respond since I didn't want to scare her. She moved her lips against mine a little bit insecure, her touch was soft and sweet and her mouth was warm and tasted like lemon. Our kiss got deeper and I noticed how she got more comfortable and confident, our breathings were synchronised and she took her hand to my cheek while I moved mine to surround her waist. I could feel her smiling through the kiss and I did the same, biting her lip and going back to kissing. A couple of seconds later, we finally separated, catching air with a huge smile on our faces."Granger, Ron wanna talk to you" A masculine voice could be heard as we noticed the door being opened. We turned around and found Fred looking at the two of us with his eyebrows raised. Hermione put a bit of distance between us, standing up and looking at Fred completely flustered."I'm g-going," she simply whispered, walking out of the dorm, but Fred was not listening to her since he had his eyes on me, breathing slowly and with a fierce bright in them, like a lion looking at its prey. I smiled arrogantly, arching one of my eyebrows, challenging him."What have I told you about knocking first, Weasley?" I simply said. He took his hands to his hips and I allowed myself to cover his body with my eyes. He was shirtless, leaving his crafted and full of freckles and scars torso free, with only his tight pyjama pants hanging from his hips, showing the brand of his boxers. I couldn't help but lick my lips."What were you two doing so close?" he drawled, narrowing his eyes. "I thought you weren't friends...""Well, people get closer, you know?" I teased him, starting to walk towards him slowly. Playing a little bit."Are you trying to pull my brother's crush, Arambella?" Fred murmured with a deep voice."I'm not trying anything. The girl wants us to be friends and I'm up for it." I responded, faking innocence and breathing deeply. "And, considering how Hermione reacts with me, I might have more opportunities than your little brother."He scowled and when I got even closer, his eyes went from up to down in my body. Fred breathed heavier."You keep being the same bitch," he mumbled, then separated from me and walked out of the room.I don't know why I enjoyed so much teasing him and even though Hermione's kiss was amazing, I kept having Fred's attached to my mind. Rekindling this moment in my mind, I noticed a detail that almost got out of my memory and with a huge smile on my face I ran out of the dorm, having the twins' room as my destination.The door was closed, but I could feel George talking with Sirius on the first floor, so I simply opened the door without knocking first and entered the room. It was very big, with enough space for both of them, and decorated with Gryffindor stuff. Laying in one of the two beds, with one leg hanging off and his arms over his face, was Fred trying to control his breath. I focused my eyes on a certain part of his body and smiled when I noticed my mind was correct."You okay?" I teased, calling his attention and biting my lip again, mischievously."Nobody taught you to knock first?" he hissed, standing up and turning around to avoid looking at me."I could say the same." I closed the door behind me. "What happened, Freddie? Did you want to be Hermione at that moment? You want me that close to you?"He chuckled and quivers covered my body from up to down, I could already feel the wetness growing in between my legs so I breathed deeply."You're out of your mind.""Says the man who got hard," I whispered, getting closer to him."And how do you know I'm hard for you and not for her?" he talked with an even deeper voice, looking at me over his shoulder without turning around.That was my time to snicker."Because she's your little brother's crush and, as far as I'm concerned, she's not the one you kissed already twice because you can't control yourself," I drawled, again, faking innocence."You little bitch." he murmured. Then, without giving me time to respond, Fred turned around, grabbed my waist with one hand and my neck with the other one, pinning me against the wall and sticking my body to his, making me feel every single part of him against me. His breath mixed with mine and while there was almost no distance between our faces, between our bodies there wasn't any at all. That's how I wanted to have him.I felt his hard dick from his pyjama pants pressing against me and a little gasp escaped my mouth. Fuck, I bet he's big.With the precision of an expert, he opened my legs with his knee and positioned himself between them, making his dick be in full contact with my vagina over the clothes. I held back from moaning at his warm touch."Are you ever going to stop provoking me, Lilith?" he hissed, in a soft but sharp whisper. With his fingertips pressing my neck and driving the tingles directly to below my belly. I moved my hips slightly and he closed his eyes, controlling himself from making any noise. "I bet you want me to fuck you so badly, don't you, darling?"I smirked, continuing with the dead and torturing slow movement of my hips over him, he was even harder than before. Fuck, we both were too worked up to stop now."Oh, you wanna fuck me so badly, don't you, Freddie?" I reversed his words, teasing him more.His lips caught mine and he bit my lower lip leaving a little mark, getting as much of me as he could."I do," he desperately answered.Full of ego, I took a little jump and surrounded his hips with my legs, pulling us even closer. Fred's mouth went straight to mine and we started to melt into each other with all the passion and fierceness we had restrained until now. He walked backwards and let himself fall on the bed with me on top of him, straddling his hips. I separated my lips from him and saw how his brown eyes were darker than ever while he was taking off my shirt, feeling his fingertips burning me everywhere he touched me. I took advantage of my position and started rubbing myself against his erection, feeling it throbbing under me. Fred closed his eyes and leaned his head back, panting.I took off my bra and moved my fingers to touch his body softly while his hands went to my breasts, caressing every inch of my skin that was naked. He was admiring me, full of desire as if I was a goddess, and I felt so damn powerful. This was way better than my fantasies...He moaned in a hushed tone, before pushing himself up and surrounding my waist with one of his strong arms, using his other hand to cup one of my breasts to kiss and suck all over my skin, leaving love marks that will definitely last. His mouth on my skin felt burning and pleasant, making me close my eyes. He definitely knew what he was doing. "Fucking gorgeous."I took my hands to his long ginger hair and made the movement of my hips faster, he moaned softly against my lips. Fred squeezed the skin of my waist while he was trying to catch his breath, his lips went to my neck where he kept tempting me with his warm kisses and biting me softly while moving his hand right there too to press and turn me on even more.With his arm fondling my back, he turned us around, so now he was on top of me, having all the control. He separated a little bit and smiled mischievously. Damn, this man had me at his feet.He kept kissing my naked skin until he got to the start of my shorts, passing the tip of his tongue through the space between my belly button and the strip of my clothes and I couldn't feel more excited. He took off my shorts and my panties impatiently and made our eyes meet quickly, with an intrigued gaze. I nodded letting him know he could do whatever he wanted with me. I was completely his at that moment.Smirking, he spread my legs leaving me completely exposed to him. His eyes brightened even more and got even darker, while he passed his tongue by his lower lip."Beautiful..." I heard him whisper.He put his mouth in my inner thigh, starting to kiss and bite while going down, falling into pleasant torture. The tremors running through my spine, I felt the fire growing in my veins and how my heart raced, begging internally for his lips to finally meet my wetness. Passing over it without touching it, he started to give the same attention to the other thigh."Freddie, please..." I complained, moving my hips. His eyes found mine at the same time he sucked my skin so fucking close to where I wanted him."What do you want, Lilith?" he asked amused."Touch me, please." I whimpered when I felt his breath against my pussy.He smiled."I'm sorry, darling, but I have other plans for the two of us," he replied in the same arrogant way while coming closer to my face and kissing me messily and roughly. The anticipation of having him made me take his pants and boxer off, feeling every part of him touching me. We broke the kiss for him to grab his dick and position it in my entrance. His body was an absolute dream and damn, I was right, he was so big."Mmh, you're so ready for me," he whispered in my ear, feeling my wetness growing against him and rubbing the tip, teasingly.When he found the perfect position, his eyes went back to mine, he caught briefly my lower lip between his teeth, and then, caressing my upper lip with his thumb, he pushed into me. We moaned at the same time. Merlin, it was so good. I could sense him in every inch inside of me.He was simply perfect."Fuck, Lilith, how can you feel so damn good?" he groaned with a hoarse voice, while he started to push himself even deeper and harder, still slowly, to let us both feel every part of the other one. "You can't imagine how much I craved this."Oh, Merlin"Fred..." I moaned in his ear, making him snarl as he pushed harder.I couldn't help but close my eyes and gasp, the immense pleasure he was giving me was mixed with a bit of pain because of how tight I was after so much time without sex, but also my sensitivity was way more elevated than ever."You want me to keep going?" he asked with a deep voice, moving his hips in little circles to let me get used to his size. I struggled to find my own voice."Y-yes, Freddie, please."He carried on banging harder and started to go slightly faster. None of us could control the moans and whines going out of our mouths even though Fred was trying to drown his in my lips as he crashed his hips against mine harder. One of his hands went back to my neck, pressing slightly, making me pant, while his other hand was on my hip to make his thrusts even deeper and rougher. Fuck, how could he be so good?Fred moved his lips from mine to my jaw and I took my hands from pulling his hair to his back, scratching, gaining a deep and raspy moan from him. The tip of his dick found the perfect spot and I gasped loudly, digging my nails in his skin, making him groan and marking him. Noticing that was my weak spot, Fred hit aggressively and faster, leaving my mind completely blank and crying out of pure pleasure, pretty much out-of-breath.His touch felt heavenly, every place in my skin was weak at him and knowing how I was having the same effect on him made me feel so full of myself.I got nearer to his body to make us be even more closely and as we two started to moan and whimper louder, almost reaching the climax, with the pressure in my hips becoming almost unbearable, taking me so close to the edge."You can cum inside if you want," I managed to say, stuttering, as I noticed how he was throbbing inside of me. His eyes pierced me, pleased, as he nodded fervently.I felt how my inner walls became tighter, making him moan raspy and hit even rougher. Fred covered my whimpers of pure pleasure with his kisses, swallowing it, as I felt how my biggest orgasm invaded me, clenching even more around him and feeling the juices sliding right there where our bodies were connecting. My nails dug deep in his back and he separated a bit from my face, letting me see him reaching his own pleasure and panting, making my orgasm more intense. Wow..."That's it, darling, cum for me." he groaned in a whisper, almost stuttering, giving his last hard pushes before releasing himself, throbbing and pulsating, with one last hard moan. "Oh, Lilith!"We both rested for a couple of seconds with him still over my body and inside of me.Looking at each other's eyes, catching air with effort and we both smiled arrogantly at the same time.Fucking hell, Fred Weasley, what are you doing to me?

As soon as our bodies went back to normal, I stood up, with my legs still trembling - what made Fred snicker - and started to get dressed to leave his room. It wasn't like we would stay cuddling together all night...

"Uhmm, do you know any contraceptive charms?" Fred asked, rubbing his face with his hands.

I turned around to put on my bra when I noticed how I was feeling the blood accumulating in my cheeks.

"No need to," I said trying to sound confident. "I take the Muggle contraceptive pill, for my period cramps."

I glanced at him and he was already up, with his boxers on.

"And, are you sure that works on you?" he asked not too convinced.

"I've been taking them since I was 14 and no children in sight, so what do you think?"

He chuckled, "A'right, don't have to take your claws out again, Arambella. I had enough of them right there." his eyes pointed to the bed.

I rolled my eyes trying not to show how flustered I actually was. I have fucked Fred Weasley! And I don't regret it! What the fuck is going on with me?!

"I don't think I have to say this but just to make sure; not a word, to anyone, about what happened here." I piped up, ready to leave.

He nodded, with a proud smile on his shiny face. The tension was still tangible in the room. Even though I'd suppose it would magically erase right after we fucked, it felt like, instead, it was growing more and more. Without any other word, I opened the door but when I was about to give a step out, I crashed with a tall body. I saw a brown and kind pair of eyes.

"Lilith!" George Weasley greeted, eating from a big bag of crisps. Confusion appeared in his eyes pretty soon. "What 're you doing in here, mate?"

Think fast.

"I lost something and I thought the prat of your brother had it." I managed to reply without stuttering and sounding convincing enough. I could feel Fred's gobsmacked eyes on my back.

George seemed to agree with that but then, his eyes went straight to his twin and his face showed full of surprise and shock. He almost let his food drop.

"Oh, wait! Wait, wait!" he chuckled, still freaking out. "You two...! Blimey! I fucking knew it! Lost something, huh, Lilith?" the sarcasm flooded his tone while he entered the room, and sat in his bed, eating crisps, looking completely amused. "Maybe you lost the 'D'?"

"Fuck's sake, George!" Fred growled, holding back his laughter.

I tightened my lips trying not to laugh or to embarrass myself even more. What about the 'no one knowing'?

"You can keep your bloody jokes to yourself, pal. It only happened once." Fred stated, standing beside me.

I nodded, even though the embers inside me weren't pleased with that at all. I can't want more of him. "Yeah, we just found a way to fight and release all the rage we had for each other and did it. Just once."

George looked at the two of us with an ironic stare.

"Are you two really trying to convince me of that bullshit?"

"What bullshit?" We asked at the same time.

"That you two are going to be pleased with just one fuck," he responded unbothered, throwing one crisp inside his mouth. "Don't believe you."

"We are telling you, and how would you know we are lying, if we were, anyway?"

"Georgie knows everything, dear." he winked at me.

I clicked my tongue and simply left right back to my dorm. On my way, I thanked in my head that the dorm's walls were thick enough to not let any sound go out of them, otherwise all the house would have known about what just happened.Entering my room, quietly, I found Hermione wasn't sleeping yet."Where were you?" she asked softly."With Weasley." that was true... "Arguing, as usual." Off you go, liar."Ron apologised..." she announced, with a tiny and shy smile as I got inside my bed."That's great.""And about what happened before...""Yes?""Well, I think I might like girls a little bit. Still think I have a huge preference for boys but...uhm, you know.""I do, and that's completely okay. I'm slightly more attracted to women than to men but that doesn't mean I'm more valid than you or you're more valid than me. Your sexuality is your freedom, Hermione. Enjoy it."✵ ✵ ✵

When I woke up, I was alone in my dorm. Getting up and pulling a thin robe for the morning cold, I went straight to the kitchen, with my legs still a bit numb and a little pain in between them. It was bearable though, and absolutely worthed it.

The fucking bastard did know how to fuck.

When I entered the kitchen, Mrs Weasley and Sirius were making breakfast. I quickly got in the seat next to Remus, with a smiley Tonks in front of me and Hermione next to her. Two minutes later, the twins made their entrance, both seemed pretty tired and still sleepy, especially Fred who didn't bother to put on a shirt or to brush his hair, he was only with grey sweatpants. They both sat at the same time in the other two seats next to Tonks and Fred's eyes met mine for just a second. I took my glass of orange juice and gave it a sip, listening to Dora talking to Hermione and Ginny who had just arrived.

I felt Remus grabbing my hand discreetly and putting a little note in it. I looked at him, scowling, but he avoided my eyes, being a bit flushed. Opening the note, I found a list of spells, not normal kind of spells but contraceptive ones.

Oh, shit.

I choked with my juice.

"Lilith, dear, are you okay?" Sirius asked concerned, making everyone at the table staring at me. I nodded, still coughing.

"Remus! What is this?" I asked in a whisper.

"Well," he cleared his throat, "I heard something last night from one of the dorms and considering Hermione, Ginny, Ron and George were with me and how Fred is staring at you, I joined the dots and I don't mean to interrupt in your sexual life, but maybe this will help."

I felt the blood abandoning my face of pure embarrassment.

"Did anybody else hear?"

"Oh, no, you don't have to worry. It's the werewolf hearing, and it was very dim so don't worry, I understand," he answered, still a bit uncomfortable.

"Thanks, Remus, but I'm okay, I take Muggle meds for that."

He simply nodded.

"Also, my mouth is completely shut," he added.

I thanked him and we kept chatting as usual. An hour later, Remus invited me to join him for our usual classes and Tonks decided to come with us.

After another hour of practice, the three of us sat there on the floor, with some music sounding through Sirius's gramophone and a piece of chocolate in our hands.

"My mother thinks you're really cool, Lilith," Tonks said, handing me a beer. "She says you remind her to her young self. You should meet her."

"Oh, the legendary Andromeda Black, one of the first rebellious Slytherins! I'd love to meet her." I replied, observing how Remus opened the huge windows so the air of the first days of August could invade the room. "Being able to confront her family and show not all Slytherins are bad...the dream of my life."

"You know it was hard for her too." Dora animated me, crashing softly her shoulder with mine. "Apparently, her mother was almost as terrible as yours. She dishonoured my mum when she started dating my dad."

"I'd prefer Circe dishonouring me than her dark obsession, though."

"Fair enough. I bet school isn't easy on you either. The reputation of the Snape and your house...lots of people tend to prejudge and think themselves better just 'cause they got in one of the goodies' houses."

"Right?! Most of the time they're even worse than us."

"Lilith doesn't have to worry anymore, Tonks. She knows lots of us think she's a good person and she's capable of doing whatever she wants. Despite being Snivellus' niece."

The number of mornings I had spent with Lupin made us come closer and talk about our families. I found in him a comforting adult figure and he found in me a piece of the teenager afraid of their reputation that he was once. I told him about my family story and he told me the truth about Snape's bullshit during his school days. Not only he was a shitty uncle but a compulsive liar, the son of a bitch. Sorry, grandma!

Sirius appeared in the door, catching our attention. It was becoming a tradition to always be him the one to tell us the class was over.

"Lilith, Dora, I'm gonna need you down there. The Weasleys and I are fighting about who has better music, the muggle world or the wizarding world. Only have Hermione on my side, need more back up, c'mon!" he rushed.

Both Tonks and I looked at each other excited and almost flew out of the room.

"Fuck off, Granger! Those Beatles have nothing to do against this band!" I heard George's voice.

"George Fabian! Watch your mouth!" Mrs Weasley shouted even though Sirius laughter was widely heard in all house.

"Shut up, you little prat. Let the true experts talk. Now, here! Lilith, Dora, tell these snobs who has better music!"

We entered one of the studios which were full of vinyl records from Muggle bands from the 70s. Sirius was leaning against one of the leather armchairs. While Mrs and Mr Weasley were reading some papers on the desk, their children, including Hermione, were sat on the floor, looking at the different records in the room.

"The Muggle world, obviously," I quickly said, crossing my arms.

The Weasley brothers snorted and Tonks high-fived me.

"You have no fucking idea, Arambella. Let the elders speak." Ron intervened, bursting confidence for once in his life.

"I'm older than you, prick."

"Whatever, Muggles can't make magic tricks with the guitar, can they?"

"You haven't heard AC/DC play, mate! That's better than magic."

"Muggle bands like The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Queen or Led Zeppelin would smash any of your magic tricks, children!" Sirius claimed, pointing at his cassette player.

"And those are old glories! Nowadays, no one can compete with Nirvana, Oasis or Metallica." I corroborated, high-fiving Sirius. Remus sat on the leather armchair, looking at Black with dreamy eyes. It was like they were two teenagers and time hadn't passed.

"And the Pixies!" Tonks added. "They are so good too!"

"Even Madonna is better than any of your magic bands."

"Oh, c'mon I bet you like the Sweet Girls or something like that, Lilith," Fred complained, joking as if that meant my taste wasn't good.

"It's the Spice Girls, you twat. And you better not say anything against them, Liv is their biggest fan ever, she can sense whenever someone's talking bullshit about them and she's madly in love with Mel B." I pointed my wand at him, following the joke. " I'm more a Nirvana girl."

"Yes, kid, you do know!" Sirius said proudly. "What do you think, Remus?"

"Don't throw me into your fights, Sirius!" he chuckled. "But I have to admit Queen won me at the moment I Want to Break Free and Bohemian Rhapsody aired."

"AHA! Do you see? And what about Killer Queen? That's some good shit!"

"Nah, we won't believe you until we see some proof!" the twins said at the same time.

"Okay, you'll see," I replied, grabbing Tonks's and Hermione's arms. "Sirius, let us go get some more cassettes so we can teach these ignorants what good music is."

Remus looked shocked and I could hear Mrs Weasley gasp. But Sirius seemed so up for it.

"Yeah, sure go on!"

"You three have an hour!" Remus shouted when we were already at the door.

We went straight to one of the closest and cheapest music stores in the city and got a huge amount of cassettes. Fortunately, the three of us were carrying muggle money, so we could be back at Grimmauld Place five minutes before Remus's curfew.

"Here they are!" I put the bags on the floor and Sirius went straight to get all the devices in the house where to put the music. Mrs, Mr Wealsey and Ginny had already left when we got back.

We put first one of the Nirvana ones, against the Weasley boys' will, and even though they complained a lot at the beginning and tried to look like they didn't like it at all, we could see how they ended up enjoying it.

"Welcome to Kurt Cobain's world!" I shouted, moving my hips at the rhythm of the song.

I discovered them and many other muggle bands thanks to Liv who bought me a radio cassette for my 13th birthday and let me borrow her cassettes. Now, hearing them again for the first time since I left Hogwarts, felt like a little taste of home.

Of the three of them, the one who seemed to enjoy the band the most was Fred, and actually, it was quite his style.

When Nirvana got over, Hermione put a cassette of Metallica and Ron and George enjoyed it particularly. Then, Tonks put Lenny Kravitz.

"He's so fucking hot!" I said as soon as I recognized his voice. He was one of my faves as well.

"I know!" Tonks replied, grabbing Hermione's hands and mine. We were acting like normal teenagers for a moment.

"Bah, you only like him 'cause he's hot! That doesn't count!" Ron complained.

"Shut up, Ronald." Hermione intervened, making the ginger boy blush.

We spent what it felt like hours like that until there were only two cassettes left from the huge pile we got, and Sirius and Remus already left us,' the young ones ' as they said, alone.

"Okay, I have to admit that 2Pac is good," Ron said after falling under Tonks' pressure.

"You know what I liked?" George said suddenly. "That Mr Bombastic," he giggled, "I bet that's fun to listen to while smoking that shit Wood takes after the matches."

We all burst into laughter at the same time.

"Well, I can only say I enjoyed those Nirvana and 2Pac. And maybe a little bit of Metallica. The rest's bullshit. They've nothing to do against any of ours." Fred claimed, snobby.

But there was still two untouched cassettes and, even though I'm not proud of admitting it, we two were kinda similar.

"You want to fall in love, Frederick Weasley?" I asked rhetorically as I approached the radio cassette and chose my favourite one of our selected pack. "Here you are."

Wonderwall by Oasis started playing and I sat next to the device, full of myself, by his side, while he was sitting with one of his legs flexed and his arm lazily resting over it, kinda arrogant. Fred was about to complain but as soon as he paid attention to the guitar his eyes opened shocked and I heard how he sighed, comfortably.

Ding, ding, ding! Lilith 1, Fred 0.

Everyone remained silent enjoying the song while Fred's eyes were fixed into mine. A little smile appeared on his face as he nodded softly.

"Fair enough, Lilith." he continued with a soft tone I didn't expect. "Pretty good."

There are many things that

I would like to say to you, but I don't know-how

Because maybe

You're gonna be the one that saves me

And after all

You're my Wonderwall

We kept looking at each other's eyes silently and intimately while the others were talking, out of our world. Couldn't have taken my eyes off him even if I wanted to. I felt a little flame of joy and warmth covering my body and for the first time in quite a long, I felt safe and comfortable.Perhaps this wasn't so bad after all...

"Children, today we'll have an important reunion that I'm afraid you can't assist." Remus talked, during our breakfast.

"What is it about?" I couldn't help but ask, gaining one of Mrs Weasley's suspicious look. I was getting used to them.

"Dumbledore and your uncle want to give us certain information. I can't say more, Lilith. That's Order's business, sorry."

"What I have to do to be in the Order?" I kept questioning, even if I tried not to think about it, my mind kept rambling over the He-who-must-not-be-named's topic. If he was back, I had to fight him and his henchmen.

But both Remus and Sirius shook their heads.

"You can't, Lilith. You're too young and your uncle would never let you."

"But I'm a witch of legal age! I'll be eighteen in November!"

"You haven't finished school and being part of the Order requires more than good grades in DADA, also, it could be very dangerous for you."

"Okay, then can I call Draco while you're in that mysterious reunion?" I sighed. Both Sirius and Remus shared an accomplice look.

"Uhmm, yeah, sure," Black said not too convinced.

Half an hour later, we were in our own business. The twins were getting ready since they were going to visit their older brother Bill now that he was in the city, and I was helping Tonks to prepare some food before my unbearable uncle and Dumbledore arrived.

"Here, Lilith! Give this a taste!" Tonks gave me one of the sweets she was preparing. Even though I really liked her and she was putting a lot of enthusiasm, baking wasn't exactly her thing.

I bit slowly the pastry she gave me, but as soon as it got in my tongue I felt the urge to vomit.

"Uhm, it's good, Tonks, but I think you forgot the sugar." I lied trying not to make her feel bad since she was so excited.

"Oh, shit! I knew something was missing!"

I excused myself with her saying I needed to go to the loo and I went straight upstairs to brush my teeth from the awful flavour of the sweets. When I got into my dorm, the bathroom's door was closed and I could hear the shower on, Hermione must be getting ready to go out as well. Fuck, what do I do now?

I remembered that most of the corridors included an extra bathroom apart from the ones in the rooms, so I got to the one that was between my dorm and the twins'. Lucky for me, that one wasn't closed. As soon as I got inside, I made my toothbrush appeared and I started erasing the annoying flavour from my tongue. When my mouth went back to tasting as normal, I could hear for the first time the water running down. Oh shit, someone was showering.

I raised my head and looked through the mirror to the shower behind me. The bathroom was so big that there was space enough for ten more people to get in. I saw a tall figure facing the wall, body full of freckles and little scars, red hair, and a well-built back with long scratches that covered the skin. You've got to be kidding me...

"Oh, Lilith..." Fred moaned muffled from the shower while touching himself. It was such a tempting and sexual view that made my whole body burn and to feel my underwear going wet against me as well. Damn it. "My Lilith..."

He leaned his head back, moving his hand faster over himself while the hot water was still falling over him, making him look more attractive. For a moment, I considered getting inside the shower with him, but that was such an intimate and personal moment that I simply got out of the bathroom, ensuring not to make any noise and having his deep voice moaning my name deep inside my mind.When I got to the first floor, I found Remus talking with someone that was so bloody familiar to me. I snorted."Good morning, Lilith." Snape talked, making Remus turn around to smile at me, greeting, while Severus kept his indifferent look.I remained silent."Remus, can I already use the phone?" I asked after a couple of seconds of awkward silence."Yeah, sure, you already kn-""You are not going to talk to me?" Snape interrupted him, looking at me with anger and incredulity.I switched my eyes from Remus to him, making sure they looked cold and big-headed."I have nothing to talk to you," I replied transmitting the same emotions my eyes did.I heard Remus gasping behind Snape, he seemed to be trying to hold his smile and at the same to give me a severe look. The man in front of him, however, was throwing daggers at me with his gaze. I smiled at him arrogantly and continued walking to the office where the muggle telephone was. Since I never owned an owl or a cat, I always used muggle technology to communicate with my friends outside of school, even though Draco's family weren't fans of it.After a couple of minutes, Draco finally answered the phone."Hello?""Finally! It took me ages to contact you, mate!""Lilith? Is that you?""Who else then? 'course it's me, Draco.""Oh, thanks, Merlin! I've been waiting a long time for your call"At that moment, Fred entered the office with his hair still a bit wet and casual clothes. He didn't look very happy, though. Anyway, my heart raced as soon as I saw him and I forced myself not to seem nervous."Who 're you talking to?" he asked roughly."Draco," I said with an obvious tone.He scowled and entered the room, leaning against one of the desks."What do you want?" I asked him before going back to my friend."I don't trust Malfoy, I want to know what does he tell you and, most important, what do you tell him."I hissed and rolled my eyes, ignoring him."How've you been, Draco?""I'm okay, bit lonely, though. My parents are barely at home.""Why?""Dad's business, I don't want to ask him.""Are you eating well? You keep having your vitamins?"I could hear him sigh."Yeah...""Draco Lucius Malfoy, you better not be lying to me." I threatened him. He had the same problem most of us, kids with parent issues, had; not taking care enough of ourselves."I might have skipped dinner a few times..." he finally admitted."I hope that doesn't repeat, you don't want me to send you a howler, do you?""No..." he softly said."Right, but I didn't call you to tell you off. How's been your summer?""I kept going to Blaise's so I wasn't in this bloody huge mansion all by myself, what about you? Are the blood traitors treating you well?"I couldn't help but chuckle, it was comically ironic that he loved me so much even though I was far from being a pureblood but he hated so much the Weasleys, who were all from magic ancestry."I'm fine, don't worry. They're being quite cool."We kept talking about trivial stuff for a little longer, I didn't want to ask him or tell him about personal stuff since Fred was still listening even though I did need to have a chat with the blond boy on our own. After a while, Fred left the room and came again five minutes later."Sirius is calling you, the reunion's over," he announced to me."Draco, I have to leave. But I promise I'd see you soon, okay?""Okay, take care, Lilith. You know I consider you my family.""I do, you know I love you so much, mate. Take care as well and don't forget your vitamins or I'll punch you. Bye!" I put the phone down and left the room, followed by Fred. The previous moment of the shower was still on my mind and it felt like a burst of confidence. Even though if he wanted to keep with that senseless hate towards me, I knew deeply, he desired me as well, and that was something he would not be able to deny."Well, what did Malfoy tell you?" Black asked me once we got to the kitchen."Huh?" I scowled.He looked at me confused, like if his question had an obvious answer."I let you talk to Malfoy because I thought you would get information about his father.""What? I don't talk with Draco about his father!""Lucius is a Death Eater, Lilith, and I bet he will try to make his son become one."Oh no, there was the prejudice again. I knew Draco wasn't exactly the best person in the world but, a Death Eater? That's too much, even for him."Did he mentioned Lucius at least?" Sirius asked again, rubbing his face."He did, but only said he wasn't usually at home because of some business. Nothing new.""She was already talking with him when I arrived" Fred interfered, behind me, leaning against the countertop, crossing arms and ankles."Yeah, I asked him if he was taking his bloody vitamins, for fuck's sake," I replied already a bit pissed off.Molly Weasley chuckled, while she was putting some coffee in a cup, "Sure you did." she ironized.I frowned my eyebrows."I did."Remus suddenly entered the room."What's going on?" he interrogated while positioning himself next to Sirius."Your kid, Lupin. She's been talking to Malfoy's boy and doesn't want to tell us the truth.""I already told you I asked him if was eating well and we chatted about his bloody summer!" I answered, indignant."Watch your mouth, Lilith," Fred mumbled behind me, but I ignored him."And you intend me to believe you?" she raised her voice making eye contact with me for a couple of seconds. "I told you, Remus, and you kept defending her. I told you she's just like her family. I never trusted her.""You're terribly wrong with her, Molly!" Remus stated, looking actually pretty angry but still, controlling himself. "The kid did nothing wrong, and if you don't trust her because of her family, then you shouldn't trust Sirius either and here you are, in his house. The house of the most pureblood obsessed family in all Britain.""Sirius has proved his innocence!""And Lilith hasn't?!"Her eyes met mine again and looked like if she wanted to make me vanish in that exact moment."The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." she spat.I clenched my fists because of all the rage growing inside of me."I understand you don't like me, Mrs Weasley." I started, remaining as calm as possible. " I know what my mother did to your brothers and I'm terribly sorry, but don't forget I'm not her. I've been carrying with all her fucking crimes my entire life and I'm sorry if I'm not a brave innocent baby like your dear Harry, but I wasn't raised to believe I was a hero or to have someone saving me. I'm trying to revenge myself and the ones who were hurt by those bastards but people like you insist on pointing me like the villain instead of them. I'm only seventeen years old and if you can't fucking see that, then perhaps I'm not the child in here."She gasped and I felt someone grabbing my wrist and slamming me against the wall. Soon, I had Fred's wand on my neck while his eyes looked at me full of rage."Do not dare to speak to my mother like that, Arambella." he drawled with the fury present on his tone.I stared at him, incredulous of his words. Wasn't he seeing how his mother was treating me? Wasn't he present when I was talking with Draco? "Back off, Weasley." I threatened him, instantly taking my wand out and putting it against his chest. I was feeling a huge bitterness in my guts, all the contrary from our moment with the music. That seemed right now pretty far away.He narrowed his eyes and clenched his jaw. I wasn't scared of him."I'm not scared of you, don't tempt me, Lilith. I told you once not to mess with my family or I'd make you regret it," he whispered looking completely distant."Fred, let her go. She has the right to be mad." Remus talked remaining calm but with a firm voice, making Fred instantly get slowly away from me and walk beside his mother "She wasn't lying when she said she didn't talk anything out of normal with Malfoy.""How would you know?" Molly asked him."Fred, you were there, weren't you?" the ginger nodded. "And did you hear her mention anything suspicious?"This time he shook his head and stared at his own feet, like if he was a bit embarrassed."Yeah, I thought so, and I know 'cause I was listening to their conversation," Remus admitted.I felt the blood abandoning my face."Remus..." I found my voice to softly speak. The only person I truly trusted in this house didn't trust me back?He guessed the pain in my eyes and quickly cleared out the situation."I trust you, Lilith, blindly. But I don't trust Lucius Malfoy, and I bet he would spy on his own son to keep track of his movements knowing you would like to talk to Draco like every summer, and as a result, he'd know about you and the Order. We can't put you at that risk, do you understand?"I sighed hard, meditating it in my mind. Yes, it made sense. My own self trusted Draco till the core but never had a good vibe from his father and always tried to avoid him."I do understand, Remus, I'm sorry," I murmured."There's nothing to apologise for.""I'm sorry, Lilith." Sirius apologised. "We shouldn't be using you to get information. But if you finally consider being in the Order, it would be a good idea to know more about the Malfoys. I'm sure you want Draco out of that Death Eater shit."I nodded."I still don't trust you." Mrs Weasley said with a cold tone. "You'll have to make miracles to earn my trust."I remained quiet."Mum, please, that's enough." Fred silenced her.And even though I wasn't expecting that and it did make me internally whoop, I still kept sceptical and hurt because of his previous attack.I was tired of him coming at me at the minimal movement of mine he considered suspicious."Molly, please, darling..." Arthur Weasley spoke for the first time.A smiley George made his entrance, leaning himself over the door's frame, completely ignorant of the uncomfortable moment we just had there."Freddie, ready to leave?" he grinned, but when he saw our faces, his expression became worried. "Is everything okay? Why those long faces?""No worries, mate. Everything's okay." I intervened giving him a comforting smile."Yeah, c'mon, Georgie. Bill's probably waiting for us." Fred continued, grabbing one of Sirius' leather jacket - shit, it fucking suited him so well! - that Black let him, while already walking out."Lilith, I know you don't want to, but your uncle really wants to talk to you. You should give him a try, at least to shut him up while he is here." Remus tried to convince me.Great, can everything go fucking worse?

"You finally decided to talk to me?" Snape burst as soon as I put a foot inside the room.

"Remus convinced me."

"Professor Lupin," he attempted to correct me.

"His name is Remus," I said, looking at him with boredom.

"There's no reason at all for you to call him by his name, you're not friends."

"What do you want, Snape?"

He sighed, "How are you feeling?" he asked trying to come closer to me and slightly softening his tone.

I didn't hesitate.

"You can stop pretending you care."

"Can you stop being so disrespectful? I'm trying to behave as your relative."

"I don't give a fuck about how you want to behave today, tomorrow you'll go back to behave like Dumbledore's muppet."

"I came here personally to see how you were feeling. I know you miss your home."

"Still don't give a fuck, Snape. And don't be such a liar, I know you came to give information to the Order." I crossed my arms.

Someone knocked on the door, interrupting Severus's response. Without waiting for any of us to speak, Dumbledore entered the room.

"Severus, I'd like to have a word with you." the old man said, ignoring my presence, and addressing Snape straightly.

I have to admit I felt a little current covering me, even though he was far away from being my cup of tea, he was still the greatest wizard alive and he intimidated me a lot.

"Sure, sir, my niece was already leaving."

Without any other word, I went straight to the other studio on the same floor to have a fucking cigarette in peace. I didn't even bother to turn the lights on, just went to the window in the middle of the darkness, and lightened my cig.

I was feeling as tired as the first day I got here, these last months were being a rollercoaster. Trying to leave my mind blank not to think about anything, I stayed in silence for as long as my cigarette lasted. A couple of minutes later, I noticed how someone turned on the light, so I turned around.

"What are you doing here?" I ask coldly when I saw him.

He was looking different. Still wearing the same clothes I saw him going out with, but now his ginger hair was way shorter than before, making him look more mature and older. It suited him, but I wouldn't admit it aloud, I was still hella pissed off at him.

"Grabbing some cigs," he responded with a soft tone. "I will not bother you for too long, promise."

"Nevermind, I'm already leaving." I started walking, using the same cold tone, and crashing my shoulder against his as I got out.

This time, I went straight to my bed and fell asleep as soon as my head touched the pillow, hoping the next day would better.

The scenario changed; grey walls with stains and scratches, the oxidated cells and the deadly cold. I was in Azkaban.

"Lili, baby, you are finally here." I heard her whispering and gloomy voice and instantly started to tremble. "Just in time to see what I'm going to do."

I tried to move but my hands were tied roughly with ropes that were hurting my wrists. I was sat on the rocky floor, so I couldn't get up.

"I'm not going to join you, mother." I tried to say without stuttering but failed since it sounded

if I was already crying.

"I know, Lili, you have been a tough one. And since you didn't want to join your mommy in her magnificent future for you, I had to take justice into my hands." she drawled.

"What do you me-?"

"They're all dead." she interrupted me, walking from the darkness to make her visible. She was looking exactly like the last time I saw her free. "Potter, her mudblood friend, the blood traitors, all of them. Including him, you know. I killed them all. I became a murderer for you, dear."

I knew exactly who she was referring and I felt the tears coming to my eyes, I didn't care if she saw me weak anymore. It was over. She won.

She seemed unbothered by my sobbing, actually, she seemed pleased. Circe Snape got closer to me and caught my face between her hands, digging her long nails in my cheeks.

"But I left someone alive. Someone I wanted you personally to witness how I kill him."

She separated for me and dragged from the darkness a tall man that had his throat and his hands chained. Circe made him kneel in front of me and raised his face with her wand.

greeneyes, his messy hair, the shape of his lips, the structure of his face...the same as mine. That man in front of me was Ares Arambella. Looking exactly like the day he left us.

"Lili..." he tried to mouth with a hoarse voice. I almost had forgotten the sound of his voice after all these years and hearing him calling me like that made me cry even louder.

Circe didn't let him talk more as she turned him to face her. There were no words needed, she was looking at him with an arrogant smile, the same one I always used, and he was looking at her terrorized.

"Avada Kedavra!" the dead body of my father fell to the floor with his eyes looking at me. Fuck.

She smiled and went back to me. Taking a dagger out of her boot, she put it against my throat.

"I told you, Lili," she whispered, with the smile still on her face and the madness coming out of her. "You cannot escape from me. If you are not mine, then you are no one's."

Then, absolute darkness.

"NO!" I shouted waking up and sitting in my bed, with tears coming down my cheeks.

The light turned on and Hermione went straight to my bed.

"Lilith! What happened?!" she got my hands between hers, trying to calm me. But I kept seeing them.

"No, please, no!" I continued crying. I looked more like a child than a teenager, but the pain inside was consuming me.

"Come, let's grab you something to drink so you can calm down," she said softly, taking me out of bed and hugging me. "I'm with you, Lilith, I'm not going to leave you."

It was probably midnight and the corridors were empty, Hermione lead me to the kitchen and made me sit in one of the chairs as she filled a glass of water.

Lili.

You cannot escape from me.

I sobbed even harder and felt the air abandoning my lungs. I tried to catch it, uselessly.

"Hermione..." I called her, still struggling to fill my lungs with air. "I...c-can't...breath."

She opened her eyes widely and with worry on her face, she ran out of the kitchen. I rested my head in my hands, trying to calm down and normalize my breathing, but her image kept appearing in my mind. His eyes, drained of all life, and her threat. That same threat once and again.

Hermione came again, being followed by Remus who was in his clothes to sleep and seemed as concerned as Granger.

"Lilith, dear, what happened?" he asked kneeling in front of me, and the calm and soft way he talked to me, made me burst into tears again. "Oh, dear, it's alright." he hugged me, "Focus on breathing, come on, try to breathe deeply."

I obeyed and concentrated in it, as Liv had taught me, making sure to feel the air coming in and out of my lungs. After a couple of minutes, I normalized it.

"Now, can you tell us what happened?" Remus said as Hermione sat next to me caressing my back and offering me the glass of water.

I closed my eyes for a second and felt again the darkness, a single tear came out. Footsteps in the stairs could be heard and suddenly, Molly Weasley appeared in the kitchen with her robe on.

"What's going on here?" she asked with a sleepy voice.

"Lilith had a panic attack," Hermione replied, catching my hand and caressing it.

Mrs Weasley looked at me, and I had to be actually looking like real shit because this time she wasn't giving me one of those hateful stares. She seemed curious and shocked, nothing near to pity or concern, though. Not that I would expect it from her anyway.

"I dreamt with her." I finally pronounced, looking only at Remus. "Circe."

Remus took a deep breath.

"Oh, Lilith..." I heard Hermione behind me, and I could feel the tears forming again but I held them back. I hated it when people saw me crying.

"I was with her, in Azkaban. But I wasn't visiting her, I was trapped with her." my voice trembled again.

"Lilith, dear, you don't have to tell us if you don't want to," Remus said, worried about me having another attack if I remembered it.

"No, I need to." I swallowed hard and gave a little sip to the glass. "She was there, she told me she had killed everyone."

I didn't mention any name, but they knew exactly who I was talking about.

"And she said she left one last murder she wanted me to witness because she said she became a murdered for me." I struggled to talk. "It was Ares Arambella."

I couldn't call him my father.

"She killed him in front of me and then she cut my throat with her dagger, not without telling me that I couldn't escape from her, that if I wasn't hers, I wouldn't be anyone else's."

Remus kept his eyes on me all the time so I could see how even though he was trying to pay to me all his attention, he was pretty disturbed.

"Oh, my God..." Molly Weasley whispered as she let herself rest against the countertop, with her eyes lost.

Remus hugged me tightly and all my efforts to stop crying failed. I burst into sobs again and hugged him back, trying to feel his protection.

"I'm really sorry, Lilith." Remus talked. "I promise you that won't happen to you, do you hear me? It was just a nightmare and we will all make sure that it never becomes real."

After a long time between hugs and comforting caresses, Hermione and I went back to our dorm while Remus and Mrs Wealsey stayed discussing.

"Sleep with me, Lilith," Hermione said as soon as we got to our room. "I know I'm not Olivia, but maybe I can help you not to have any other nightmare."

I smiled at her, wiping out the last tears on my face.

"Thank you, Hermione," I replied, getting into her bed at the same time as her. It was quite tight, but it felt comfortable enough and for a moment, I felt like Liv was there and I was safe again.

But in the depth of my mind, I knew that what hurt me the most wasn't she killing Ares, nor even me, and that scared me as fuck.

✵ ✵ ✵

I got up pretty later than usual and as poorly rested as every time I had a nightmare. I moved from my room to the kitchen where Kreacher, the Black's domestic elf was cooking since Mrs Weasley wasn't there. I barely saw him anytime since Sirius always tried to keep him on the first floor to avoid him insulting everyone. The old elf was obsessed with the Black family and their ideology so he wasn't a very nice company, but seeing him made me miss the elves back at the Arambella house, those that always took care of me for such a long time. Now that they were old, they were probably enjoying the house by themselves and I had no problem with it. They could keep it.

I sat next to Hermione, under everyone's curious eyes. I served myself a bit of orange juice like every morning.

"Why is the dirty half-blood serving herself when it's Kreacher's duty to do so?" the elf complained. "If my mistress saw the disgusting half breed, blood traitor and mudblood master Sirius brings at the noble and ancient House of Black..."

I didn't bother to answer him but Sirius made him abandon the kitchen.

"How are you feeling, Lilith?" Black asked after a while. "Remus told me about your little incident last night."

Oh, so that's why everyone was staring at me as if I was about to explode. I didn't mean to be ungrateful, since I knew Remus told them just in case I had another attack and they could help me, but it also felt like one of my biggest secrets was out for everyone to know.

"I'm better, thank you."

"Could you get back to sleep?" Remus asked.

"Yeah, I slept with Hermione."

He nodded and all of them changed the topic to make me a bit more comfortable. Apparently, my uncle had left already because Dumbledore kept requiring him. Surprising? Not at all.

"Lilith, can I have a word with you later?" George suddenly asked with his usual kind tone, making sure no one was listening.

"Sure."

After he finished breakfast, I got up ready to follow George but a hand surrounded mine before I could leave.

"I know we haven't talked yet because my mother makes me always by her side, but, if you like and need anything, you can count on me." Ginny Weasley said, giving me a kind smile. I looked at her, at first surprised, but then I imitated her smile and nodded, thanking her.

That was unexpected...

I went behind George to one of the main living rooms. He let himself lean against the wall next to the chimney. He had his hair cut just like his brother and they looked even more similar.

"I know you argued with my mother yesterday." he started calmly. "Fred told me."

I lowered my head looking at my feet. One of the last people I wanted to be shouting at me was George, especially because I never saw him angry so I didn't know how he would react.

"Yeah, he was pretty cross with me," I murmured. "So was your mum."

"I know, and I wanted to say sorry to you."

"Wait, what?" that really took me by surprise.

"Yeah, my mother shouldn't have spoken to you like that, nor Fred. But, if that lifts a bit your mood, Freddie spent all afternoon feeling repentant, he didn't mention any other thing, even Bill wanted to know what he did so bad for not shutting the fuck up, but he's too proud, or maybe too scared of you cursing him if he approaches you to try to apologise."

I would lie if I say I didn't feel butterflies in my stomach. Fuck.

"Also, I think mum feels sorry too. This morning when she was talking about your nightmare, she seemed a bit concerned," he announced. "Obviously, this doesn't mean she likes you, 'cause she doesn't. Not at all. Sorry 'bout that too, but at least it's a little step."

"Guess so," I said putting my hands in the pockets of my hoodie. "Thanks, Georgie."

"What are you two talking about?" Fred appeared walking towards us and standing next to his twin, who smiled at him. I looked at him with indifference. That was better than cold and distance! Because even if he wanted to apologise, he hadn't done it yet.

He sounded just as nice as when he declared us 'in a truce'. Oh, so George was right, he was feeling shit. Good for him.

"Just chatting a bit, mate," George replied, looking at his brother as if they were communicating by telepathy.

"Mmh." Fred simply nodded, looking like if he wanted to add something but he didn't dare to.

"Gotta go," I announced. "Need to see Hermione, but see you two later."

George nodded and Fred was about to when suddenly, his eyes went from mine to all across my body and then focused on my forearm. His eyebrows frowned, looking puzzled.

I followed his eyes and he was staring at my scar. I tried to hide it behind my back but it was too late.

"What's that?" he asked confused.

"Quidditch scars," I said too fast for them to believe me.

"It doesn't look like." he quickly responded. "Let me see."

Before I could refuse to, he caught my arm and examined the old wound.

"What happened to you?" he whispered passing his finger through it, making me let out my arm from his grip.

"Nothing to worry about. It's already healed."

"Lilith, that looked like..." George didn't know how to continue but I could read what he wanted to say.

"A dark mark? Yeah, I know. This is courtesy of my dearest mother." I said sarcastically, trying to play it down because I was aware that they wouldn't leave without a credible answer. "She wanted me to be like her so much that she did it with her bare nails, against my will obviously, in my last visit to Azkaban when I was 13."

They looked so shocked. Perhaps that was too much information...

Well, it was already done.

"Merlin..." they said at the same time.

"But it's okay, I'm okay. I promise." I proceeded to excuse myself before more questions to answer. "Gotta go for good, boys. See you!"

I ran upstairs and got straight into my empty room, where I focused to take deep breaths. I hated talking about the scar, I hated remembering her. Feeling overwhelmed, I ran my fingers through my hair.

I noticed how the door behind me opened, but thinking it was Hermione I didn't bother to turn around to confirm.

"Well," Fred's voice spoke. "I think you and I have a pending matter."

"What do you want, Weasley?" I faced him, turning around.

"Oh, so it's 'Weasley' again, not 'Freddie'..." he talked softly, almost in a murmur, while nodding slowly. "Guess I deserve it."

I stayed silent, staring at him, with an eyebrow raised and my arms crossed. He looked shy, something extremely unusual for Fred Weasley. He tightened his lips, struggling to find the right words.

"I came to apologise and to offer you to stay in that truce we were" he finally said after losing my war of looks. "I was a bit of an asshole to you yesterday."

"A bit?" I asked ironic, with my defences still up. "You didn't correct your mother even though you listened to the entire conversation." his eyes fell to his shoes, being embarrassed. "And I only called you 'Freddie' once, don't get too excited."

"I get it." he chuckled nervously. "I'm really sorry, Lilith. I was crossed with everyone and everything yesterday and I made you carry the can for it."

I looked at him straight to the eye. Even though his words weren't the best apology, he seemed sincere and as if he really wanted my forgiveness. I finally gave up, sighing.

"Fine, we're in a truce."

His face of an abandoned puppy changed into a mischievous smirk. He walked slowly, shorting the distance between us, with his hands behind his back and still a bit hesitant. When he was close enough, his eyes downed to my lips and he passed his tongue over his lower one, while taking a deep breath, that almost made our chests touch.

He passed one of his arms around my waist to make us closer, touching me, feeling his warm and soft stroke through the hoodie I was wearing, and approached his face to mine, making our lips being in contact without kissing. I made the biggest effort not to close my eyes and let him do whatever he wanted to me, Fred, however, kept smiling cockily.

"But don't think this is going to make us friends, darling," I whispered still in that position, only one movement and I'll be kissing him again. "I still hold your grudges for all your bullshit during these years that you haven't apologised for." I fakely smiled. "And I'm not gonna forgive you that easily."

I thought that would make him separate and hurt his unbearable ego, but he bit his lower lip with that smirk still on his face and his brown eyes going darker.

"Mmh, playing hard, huh?" he lowered his voice, making it deeper. I had to control the chills that concentrated in my lower belly and stay stoic. "I like it."

✵ ✵ ✵

"How have you been feeling, Lilith?" Hermione asked once I got in the library. She was accompanied by Ginny Weasley, Remus and Tonks, who quickly stood up from her chair and came to me. She passed one of her arms over my shoulder and stroke my arm, comfortingly.

"I'm better, thank you." I smiled at them. I put earlier a little bit of makeup over my dark circles and my cheeks not to look so unrested and sick, and Sirius ordered Kreacher to cook my favourite dish, so I was feeling better.

"I wish I could've been here, I bet one of our beers would've made you feel better instantly." Tonks joked, pinching my belly, tickling me. I couldn't help but snicker. Remus told me she worried a lot when they told her about my nightmare and even though I wasn't used to having so many people being worried about me, I thanked her.

I sat in one of the empty chairs, putting my feet on the desk, and gave a quick gaze to one of the books on it. It was about some pureblood shit, probably from Sirius's family. Bloody hell, how could that people believe in this fucking shit?

"Lilith, you mind if I borrow one of your new cassettes?" Ginny Weasley asked sitting next to me. She seemed like she was trying to look relaxed but had to convince herself to talk to me. I'm not that scary, am I? I gave her a little smile.

"Sure, pick whichever you want."

"Thanks! I already listened to all of Hermione's and I need more variety." she continued chuckling, and then lowered her voice. "I love her taste but she's too straight."

I burst into laughter and Hermione, who was sitting in front of us, gave the ginger a severe look.

"Ginny!"

"Wow, kid, you're funnier than I expected," I replied still chuckling while giving Hermione an accomplice look that she imitated, smiling and blushing. "But sure, Gin, I bet you have a more similar taste to mine."

"Girls" Remus called our attention. "And Ron," he added when the boy raised his head, confused, from the sofa where he was laying, humming, while eating some raspberries. "Remember tonight Dora, Mad-Eye and Kingsley will go for Harry to bring him here. You already know what you can tell him and what you can't. We have an Order reunion and you have to make sure you distract Harry enough so it is not too sudden for him."

"Shit! I forgot about it!" Tonks said, standing from her chair and making it fall to the ground. She ran to the door while stealing some raspberries from Ron's bowl. "I told Moody I'll be there at seven, I'm late! See ya later, lads!" she said leaving.

I would lie if I say I didn't feel a cold chill covering my back when I heard the Auror's name and the image of Crouch came to mind, but I focused on staying calm. He probably got what he deserved.

An hour later, a shocked Potter that looked uncomfortable, entered the house. He was looking more mature and with his hair shorter, his factions marked and paler. It was the first time I saw him wearing muggle clothes and looking like any other 15-year-old boy and not like the legendary Harry Potter. Everyone ran to hug him, while I stood aside. I barely exchanged two or three words with him in all my life so it would be hella awkward if I hugged him as well.

As soon as his eyes met mine, he seemed a bit surprised and uncomfortable.

"W-what is she doing here?" he whispered to Ron by his side.

"Snape's part of the Order, mate. And the Death Eaters also have a little obsession with me. Guess you're not that exceptional." I joked without standing up. He scowled but didn't say anything, while Ginny and George chuckled and Hermione held back her laugh because she was looking at Harry a bit worried. Fred made a funny face, surprised about my irony with Potter.

The Weasleys hugged Harry like if he was their own son. Wow, how tables turn... And Sirius focused all his attention on him. It was obvious that the man loved his godson with his entire heart. Hermione and Ron took Harry to the boy's room to inform him about everything while the twins were talking about some mischief they were planning. While the golden trio was going upstairs, Walburga Black's portrait started to shout insults against everyone that didn't fit her disturbed standard of a perfect wizard, which was, basically, everyone in this house. How ironic. Remus and Sirius ran to cover it with the curtains to shut her mouth and then went straight downstairs, to the kitchen. As they passed in front of me, I called their attention.

"I can't join the Order yet, can I?" I asked, hopeful, making my best pout and putting perfect and irresistible puppy eyes.

They shared a look and gave me a little smile, at the same time.

"I think you already know the answer is 'no'," Remus said.

"I wouldn't care, though, but Remus's the one in charge of you, kid." Sirius shrugged his shoulders. "Sorry."

I made a noise complaining, but it didn't change anything. The adults went straight to the kitchen and locked themselves there to have the Order's reunion. Since I was alone and bored as fuck, I organized the books back to their shelves and when I finished, still bored, I went upstairs.

While I was going up I heard Potter shouting about how shit his summer was and how he was the one who saw He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named coming back (even though, he did say his name). I can't blame the kid, being the main character was complicated, especially when the bad guy and his henchmen are focused on you, but also he should stop thinking he was the only one suffering in the world and learn how loved he was.

Since it was already late but was still hot outside, I took off the hoodie, staying with my skirt and top. I was planning to go upstairs, to the rooftop terrace, and smoke while looking at the London night.

When I got out of the room I found the Weasleys, Hermione and Potter trying to use some trick the twins were holding to try to listen to what the adults were discussing in their reunions. I ignored them and went straight upstairs. My need for nicotine was harder than my curiosity. The rooftop terrace's door was old and I could tell they didn't use to come up there, but the place was high and dark enough for me to go unnoticed with the night light.

The view was astonishing. From up here, I could have a privileged sight of the London Eye and the Big Ben, the London Bridge and the huge Thames River splitting the city in two. The dimly light from the houses and the pubs illuminated the night, there was barely any star in the sky because of the pollution, but the sound of the wind and its caresses on my hair as I lightened my cig, calmed and relaxed me. It felt like the city was hugging me.

I don't know how much I spent up there, but my skin was colder than usual and I was by my second cigarette. I needed this, I needed time by myself, completely alone. With the calmness covering my body and humming really softly, I felt the old door opening. However, I didn't bother to turn around.

"Talking to the darkness?" His ironic voice behind me interrupted the silence.

always had to be him?

"Having a moment alone, Fred." I corrected him.

Since he didn't talk back, I turned around, reluctantly, and found him with his eyes covering me from up to down, giving special attention to my skirt. He had his hands on the pockets of his jeans.

"Give me one." he finally spoke, pointing to my cigarette and getting by my side, imitating my position of leaning on his arms against the parapet, which was at the height of below my chest, and giving a quick stare to the view. I handed him the pack and the lighter.

"Since when do you smoke?" I asked him, confused. It wasn't the first time that question popped in my mind but now I had the perfect occasion to make it.

"Since when you do?" he returned the question to me.

"I asked first."

"Last summer. Tried and enjoyed it. I'm not addicted, though."

"I was 14 when I tried. Liked it too so, here we are. But I'm not addicted either."

He chuckled, "You sure you aren't?"

"'Course!" I replied, giving a puff, a bit offended.

"How are you feeling after that nightmare?" he drawled, not very sure of his words, after a couple of seconds in silence.

"I'm better."

"You have them often?" this time his question was quick and direct.

I nodded. Talking with him about this felt comfortable, Merlin knows for what reason, but at the same time, weird because he was Fred Weasley, and very few people around me knew about the nightmares. The least people know about you, the least they can hurt you.

Please, don't say you're sorry, I hate when people feel pity for me.

"It must be shit." he finally continued and I discreetly sighed with relief.

"It is."

"They are looking down there for you." Fred changed the topic, putting his eyes on me and giving his cig a puff, making his jaw tighten. "The reunion finished half an hour ago and dinner's ready but I bet yours is already cold. Everyone was looking for you but Remus quickly said that you'd be here."

I snickered. In one of our classes, I told Remus how much I enjoyed being on my own during the night, just breathing fresh air and letting my mind go blank, it felt good to know he actually listened to me and remembered.

"So you came?" I murmured. He simply nodded, smirking again. "Well, then I should go down." I continued, ready to walk away.

But his hand trapped my wrist and made me come closer to him. When I got in front of him again, his other hand caressed really slowly the naked skin near my hip that wasn't covered by my skirt nor my short top, while his eyes went again straight to my lips.

"You know this skirt is making the truce really hard for me, right?" he whispered, making his voice deeper.

Even with the cold wind of London night, the heat concentrated in between my legs and I could feel my underwear soaked against me. I bit my lower lip. Fred took a deep breath.

"I know," I whispered back, coming even closer to him and making our noses almost touch. He smirked. "I like playing hard."

Then I walked away, leaving Fred wanting more under the night sky.

The next morning, while Potter was summoned at the Ministery for some weird shit no one talked about, he was accompanied by Mr Weasley while the rest of us had a trip to Diagon Alley to buy things for the new course. It felt out of normal to be in the magic street with someone who wasn't Severus. The twins were more worried to get to the closest prank stuff shop than to get their supplies for school, Ron was looking at the brooms since his mother was incredibly happy because both he and Hermione were the new Gryffindor prefects, and Ginny disappeared with her mother and Hermione to get their books.For the first time, I was kinda excited about going back to Hogwarts, it would be the closest thing to going back to normal, and it would be my last year at school. I was planning to leave Slytherin high enough as the best house. Quidditch, get ready, this bitch has a lot of rages to release! Remus accompanied me to Gringotts to get some of my money before going to the shops. After my mother was imprisoned, all her fortune for the years working as an investigator in Potions before becoming a Death Eater and the inheritance my grandparents left when they died, which was declined by Severus, ended up being mine. So, as long as Circe was in Azkaban, I had enough money to live by myself. I offered Remus a good quantity of money because of how he took care of me at the Black House, but he rejected it, almost offended, saying that he did it because he wanted to, not because he wanted some economical reward for it."Well, have you already thought about what you want to do once you finish this year?" he asked as we got out of one of the book stores."Yeah, I don't think I'll apply for Auror." I finally said."Why not? Your marks are impeccable. The NEWTs are gonna be really easy for you.""I don't think becoming a wizard cop is for me, Remus."He snickered, shaking his head. "Yeah, you're a bit of rule breaker, aren't you?" he looked at me, passing his arm over my shoulder. "Sometimes I wonder why the Sorting Hat didn't put you in Gryffindor.""Oi! Don't insult me like that!" I joked, pretending to be offended. "I'm a Slytherin, heart and soul."I bit my lip, still questioning what was wandering in my mind."I think I'll try to apply for the Holyhead Harpies. They announced they'll be looking for a new Beater at the end of the next summer and the matches are not going to be out of London because of the conflict going on now so, I think I can make it into the team.""Uhm, so Quidditch, eh? Guess is also your thing and you are terribly good. You will get in the team for sure."After getting all of my school supplies ready, we were ready to meet the Weasleys again in the centre of the Alley. But as we were searching for the gingers, a familiar blonde hair appeared in my sight. My heart raced with pure joy."Olivia!" I shouted, calling her attention and some other wizards' as well. She turned around, accompanied by another witch I knew very well, and as soon as she recognised me I could see the smile growing and her eyes filling with tears.I gave Lupin my stuff and ran towards them. We melted in a huge and tight hug and the simple essence of Liv warmed my heart and made me feel at home again."How've you been, you two?" I separated from them, still with my voice trembling a bit."We have a lot to catch you up with!" Pauline said, with her beautiful brown eyes shining, a huge smile on her face and her accent more French-like than ever."I bet you do!" I joked interlacing Liv's hand with mine. " Have a lot to tell you as well, this summer was fucking wild."I turned around and saw Remus looking at me with a fatherly smile."Remus, can I go with the girls to the Leaky Cauldron?""'Course, dear! Have fun, I'll meet you in two hours here, 'kay?"I nodded, and before letting him change his mind, I dragged the two girls to the pub. Once we got there, with a good couple of butterbeer, I finally spoke, excited, sitting in front of them:"Now, tell me! What've you two been in?"They both giggled looking at each other's eyes. It was quite clear I was the third wheel here, but seeing Liv's blush and biting her lip, while Pauline was looking at her with shiny eyes as if Liv was the biggest treasure on Earth made me feel so happy for the two of them. Liv was great at showing her emotions in friendships but was deadly shy when it came to the romantic way, however, Pauline was exactly the opposite. Both complemented each other perfectly."Well, I convinced Luna and dad to spend more time in Toulouse and Pauline drove us everywhere in South France. It was so nice!" Liv started, with her melodic voice. "We had a very good time.""I'm so happy for you two." I genuinely said, while pretending to wipe out a tear in my eye, making both girls snicker."We've got to the conclusion we can try to keep a long-distance relationship. It will be hard but I know it is going to worth it." Pauline said, grabbing Liv's hand."We will write to each other as much as we can and I'll try to expend as much time during holidays with her as possible.""Well, I have some news for you too," I announced, getting ready for the grilling.It took me half an hour to catch them up with everything, submitting some little details, and being completely aware of the surprise in their faces. Especially, when I got to the Fred part."You fucked him?!" Pauline almost shouted, grinning."After snogging Hermione?" Liv completed, with the same expression.I simply nodded, a bit embarrassed."But, you know, it was only once. Still think he's a bit of a prick." I assured."Yeah, sure, didn't think that while he was inside, did you?" Pauline teased."Bugger off!" I laughed, splashing her some butterbeer while she giggled. "It was only once!""And you think it is going to be only once?" Liv asked sarcastically."Of course I do.""Don't believe you." the two of them said at the same time, repeating the words George said when he discovered us.I rolled my eyes. Bloody hell, why it was so difficult to accept?"It's not like we are friends or something. We've been hating each other since Year 1.""No, you two have been creating sexual tension around you with those stupid fights since Year 1." Liv corrected me. "It was only a matter of time for it to happen, Lilith.""I'm glad you finally decided to admit you like Fred. It was pretty obvious." Pauline said, giving a sip of her butterbeer."Oi, when did I say that? I don't like him." I said a bit pissed off."Putain, Lilith!" she burst into a laugh. "Even I noticed as soon as I saw you two talking.""Whatever." I finally gave up. I did not like him and having someone else telling me how I was feeling even though it wasn't like that and it was me who really knew how I felt, pissed me off. But I didn't want to ruin the moment with my two friends because of the bloody ginger topic, so I simply let it be.After a while, I had to say goodbye to the two of them, promising to meet Liv tomorrow morning at the train and giving a huge hug to Pauline. It took me just a few minutes to recognise Lupin in the crowd. He was still holding my school supplies and had a nice little owl in a cage."Hey," I greeted him, taking the books from his arms and carrying them. "Whose owl is that?""Yours," he stated, pretty obvious."Come again?" I questioned, surprised."It's yours. I bought it for you. I know your birthday is in November, am I right?""Yeah, on the 11th.""A'ight, so I wanted to give you the first present so once the day comes, I can give you a proper one," he replied. I was perplexed. Snape never got me an owl because he was the only person he considered I should be getting mail from and since he resided at Hogwarts, he saw it as a useless waste of money."Remus...I-" I tutted. "You shouldn't be wasting your money on me...""Oh, don't be a fool. It's a must if we are going to keep in touch, and we are definitely going to since you will be spending Christmas at Grimmauld as well."I didn't get to talk back since the Weasleys approached us ready to go back to the Order's headquarters. Liv and Pauline's words kept wandering on my mind and I couldn't help but find myself gaping at Fred every five minutes. It was pretty obvious that the hate we had for each other grew into an unsolved sexual tension within the years but was I such a masochist to start fancying him after all these years of fights and insults? He was pretty attractive, that was obvious, he knew how to entertain people and definitely knew how to fuck. He was a bit of a dickhead but in the end, he had good intentions when it came to fighting against He-who-must-not-be-named's ideas.I shook my head to try to spurn those thoughts. What the fuck was wrong with me? It was Weasley who I was talking about, for fuck's sake!Later on, while we had already our things packed and we were just waiting for tomorrow to arrive, I caught him doing chin-ups with a metal bar he somehow made appear on the roof of his room. No shirt, kinda sweaty, listening to the start of Since I've Been Loving You by Led Zeppelin. Oh, Merlin."You actually liked Sirius's old glories, didn't you?" I said, leaning against the frame of his door, calling his attention. He did not stop his exercise but smiled at me while doing them."He had a point with 'em." he simply replied with a raspy voice because of the effort. My eyes covered his body and I felt the air becoming hotter and difficult to reach. The boy was bloody handcrafted by the gods. "Enjoying the view?" he teased."Nah, more like thinking why would you work out for Quidditch when Slytherin is going to beat your ass anyway."He snickered deep."Slytherin has nothing to do with Gryffindor. Actually, I could beat your entire team by myself, so we will see about that.""You definitely will. I'm taking Quidditch seriously this year.""Sure you are. But I'm not working out only for Quidditch, though," he said starting to struggle a bit to keep the chin-ups and breathing more heavily. Damn. "Need more endurance in other aspects too."Fred stared at me straight in the eye, like a lion, and amused as fuck, of course.I snorted and left. How the fuck could someone be such an arrogant and shameless show-off? "Why such a long face?" Hermione asked once I got into the dorm. I started to get undressed because I certainly needed a shower and didn't mind if Hermione was there or not."Weasley, as usual." said, deadpan, trying to take off my bra while I entered the bathroom."Didn't expect less." the girl chuckled."He's a wanker." I simply said closing the door behind me.The hot water hugged me as soon as I got below the strong stream. It felt good to have a moment of pure self-care before the long day I already knew tomorrow was going to be. I tried to concentrate on thinking of the new course or on how I would start to prepare myself for the appliance to the Holyhead Harpies but as soon as Quidditch popped into my mind, he appeared as well.Fuck, could he give me a rest?His cocky smile appeared in my eyes as soon as I closed them, his deep breathing, his body, his touch...My hand travelled right there, where my body was demanding attention before I could be aware of it and my back leaned against the slippery wall as the hot drops still covered my body. As soon as I felt my touch over my clit, a single muffled moan abandoned my lips. I thought fucking Weasley would calm my hormones but it did exactly the opposite. I felt hornier than ever. The memory of him touching me came back to my mind as I kept moving my hand against myself and my other hand caressed one of my breasts. Thanks, Merlin, the sound of the shower was high enough to silent me. I wanted to feel again Fred kissing me, I wanted to feel him again inside of me, I wanted to hear him moaning. A bunch of memories appeared in my mind; our encounter at the rooftop, his hips crashing into mine harder and harder... I came around my own soaked and tired fingers with the image of Fred touching himself, moaning my name.Pissed off at me but with the calm everywhere in my body, I got out of the shower and covered with a short towel I found. I should start making a habit to bring my clothes into the bathroom with me. I got out of the bathroom, only covered by the thin fabric and with my hair wet, and found Hermione with some unpleasant company."Bloody hell!" I burst taking one of my hands to my chest, scared at first because I didn't expect him in here. "The fuck are you doing in here, Weasley? I had enough of you for today."At first, he was looking at me with his mouth slightly opened and his eyes dropped to cover my body from up to down with a fierce desire in them. What a great moment to be wearing the shortest towel in the bathroom. His eyes finally met mine and an even more mischievous and amused look appeared in them."I appeared to tell Granger Ron gave me something for her. Some prefect shit he couldn't give her himself 'cause Harry practically dragged him to the library to talk about what happened at the Ministry.""They locked themselves there?!" Hermione questioned quite furious.Fred nodded shrugging, taking his eyes from me for the first time.Hermione snorted and left the room with her bossy walking and kinda pissed off, leaving me alone with the ginger before I could stop her."Would you mind leaving me alone? I need to dress." I asked ironically, expecting him to leave.He passed his tongue over his lower lip."What were you doing in there?" he still had that amused and playful bright in his eyes."What do you think, witty head?" the sarcasm flew out of my mouth. "Showering, obvs.""Mmh, you sure?" he murmured, coming closer to me. I walked backwards until my back touched the wall. Shit, I was trapped."Of course, I am,""Are you sure you weren't touching yourself thinking about me, Lilith?"I felt my eyes open widely and the blood burning in my cheeks as I put the towel tighter to my body. How the fuck he knew? There's no way he could know! How the fuck he did then?!"I-I didn't." I hated myself for stuttering. He smirked. "What makes you think I-?""Don't bother, darling." he interrupted me. There was an almost decent distance between us but I still felt so intimidated by him. "Your eyes are shining.""And what if so?" I replied too quick, trying to sound mean."I've only seen them shine like after you finished," he answered, pretty obvious and sure of himself.There we go again, would I ever stop being embarrassed in front of Fred Weasley?I tried to find an excuse but nothing popped in my mind. Damn it. I changed my strategy."Fine, fair enough, I needed to relax. But what makes you think I touched myself thinking about you?" I asked, arrogant and attempting to harm his ego."Because I know no one has ever made you cum as I did," he whispered proudly, and left the room with an arrogant walking, leaving me there as a complete mess.✵ ✵ ✵

We arrived at King's Cross once we got up and had all our things ready. My lower belly hurt as soon as I woke up and my body surprised me with my period arriving a week before planned.

Well, at least there isn't a bloody mini Fred on its way. What a fucking nightmare that would be!

I tried to avoid him, chatting with Ginny, and ignoring the little gazes he threw every once in a while. I hugged Tonks and Lupin promising to write them now that I had my beautiful little owl who I named Iris, as the Greek goddess of messages.

Sirius accompanied us in his animagus form even though Moody, who I tried to avoid as much as I could, disagreed. It was weird to see the wizard walking freely in the city as a big black dog but it was very much his style. After the farewells, we got on the train. Harry soon dragged Hermione and Ron into one of the cabins, Ginny ran to meet Luna, who gave me a strong hug, and the twins met Lee Jordan and the rest of their Gryffindor pack.

I pictured Draco sitting awkwardly next to Liv, while he was talking to Blaise and the blonde girl was braiding what seemed to be a bracelet. As soon as I started to walk in their direction and passed in front of the Gryffindor gang, I felt a voice calling me.

"Oi, Arambella!" Miller, one of the most annoying Gryffs shouted. He wasn't too close to the twins but still was in their course and was an absolute prick. "Your tits've grown, girl! Cheers Godric, you don't look like your uncle! Maybe you can be a good snake and get your tongue around my cock anytime."

"Langlock" I pointed my wand at him and he took his hands to his mouth since the jinx made his tongue fix to his palate. He took his wand attempting to curse me as well, under the amused look of his mates, but I was faster. "Petrificus Totalus! You are lucky I don't curse you a worse one, Miller."

His body met the floor, gaining me some bad looks of a few people from his house while I flipped my middle finger to them, walking in Draco and Liv's direction. The two of them smiled at me at the same time.

Ah, it felt good being back at business!

"Lilith!" Draco chanted happily. Smiling at me."Malfoy!" I imitated him, sitting next to Liv, in between the two of them. "You missed me?""I did. Got you the news," he said, pointing, proudly, at a little badge in his chest. "I'm Slytherin's new Prefect."I looked at him surprised. Draco wasn't the kind of boy to get himself in trouble, at least not the kind of one to be caught, so I wasn't surprised he got chosen as Prefect, but who on Earth would like to have that responsibility?"You better be behaving well, Arambella. I wouldn't like to give you detention." he teased, eating a green apple. He had grown a lot this summer and was definitely catching the eye of some of the younger Slytherins, even though for me he kept being the same little kid."We both know you aren't going to give me detention, Draco.""Shhh, please, I have a reputation to maintain."As soon as the train stopped, I grabbed Liv's hand to get out together, while Draco almost threw himself to Potter's cabinet to mess with him. Some things never change. Being welcomed by Scotland's summer air was recovering, and being next to my best friend was even better.While we were dragging our luggage to the carriages, I gave a quick gaze to Fred. He was chuckling at something George and their inseparable friend Jordan said, I scowled. Since we got on the train, I hadn't received a single look from him, which was different from these last months when I could feel his brown eyes on me every five minutes, and it felt weird but I knew it probably was because of being back with his mates and having more people to entertain him but it wasn't like I cared or something. He could piss off if he wanted to. I wanted to go to Draco and Blaise's carriage but Liv dragged me with hers and Luna's. Obviously, I didn't complain.Soon, all the carriages started to fly, guided by the Theastrals, those creatures I couldn't see.Since ours was one of the few carriages that weren't complete, we had some company. And what a company! The golden trio and Neville Longbottom!"Cheers, 'Mione," I said to the brunette and she smiled. "Nev, mate, I've missed you!""I've missed you too, Lilith! Lots!""Hi, Lilith." Hermione softly said, and soon her eyes went straight to Luna and Liv. "Oh, guys, this is Olivia and her sister Loony-" she stopped herself and I opened my eyes widely. "I mean, Luna Lovegood, sorry."I noticed Liv tensing by my side and Luna trying to ignore it."Hermione!" I called her out in a whisper.Don't tell me she was one of the people who messed with Luna, please.The girl's eyes slightly watered, nervously, and very embarrassed."I'm terribly sorry. Oh, my God, I don't know what I was thinking. So sorry.""It's okay." Luna simply said as Liv caught her hand and caressed it.We continued the trip in silence until the doors of the castle. Once down, while everyone was taking their stuff, Hermione approached me, kinda shyly."Lilith? Are you mad at me?" she softly asked with a trembly voice. "I'm terribly sorry, I-""Hermione," I interrupted her. " It's okay. I'm not mad at you, I understand you had that name in your mind because of how much we hear it from the bloody Raves but next time, try to be more careful, 'kay? Luna has already too much to deal with."She nodded and extended her arms discreetly."Can I have a hug?"I rolled my eyes but agreed and hugged her tightly.Bloody hell, I was surrounded by crybabies.

✵ ✵ ✵

The first three days back at Hogwarts went quite normal. We had a new DADA teacher - what a surprise, huh? -, Dolores Umbridge, sent by the Ministry to keep an eye on Dumbledore. Quite weird the woman.

I received my timetable and saw my first class with her was planned for tomorrow, I hoped Remus's classes had improved my skills.

The first Charms, Transfigurations and Potions classes seemed easy enough and I cheered myself for taking a look at all the school books before starting, having decided I will apply for the Holyhead Harpies didn't mean I didn't want to keep at the top of best Slytherin students from my course.

As I entered the library looking for a Herbology book - that subject was my Nemesis -, I found a bunch of Gryffs from my course and lower ones, a couple of Ravenclaws, some Hufflepuffs, Liv not included since she was having her first class with Umbridge, and some Slytherins dispersed, Draco being one of them. As I passed in front of the Gryffindor lot, I felt someone whistling.

"Fucking hell, Arambella! I wouldn't mind shag a Slytherin if all of them had your angel face!" some prick shouted, making some of his mates giggle.

"Silencio." I chanted, quite mad. So the jokes about my mother now turned into sexual jokes, great, what a fucking year I had in front of me!

"Can you not disrespect women like that?!" I heard a familiar feminine voice complain. "She's a girl, not an object."

Hermione stood from her seat and came next to me. I looked at her, surprised. Wow, I wasn't expecting that!

"What's going on with you, Hermione?" Sienna Plums spat, closing her book. She was looking quite good, she seemed more grown-up and fancier, even if it was only her appearance. "First, you believe that Potter's shit about He-who-must-not-be-named coming back and now you defend her? Why are you defending Little Snape?"

"First of all, Harry said the truth, if you rather believe what The Prophet says then that's your problem, and second, she has a name, Sienna! And I'm not going to allow some idiot to insult or to make uncomfortable any woman like that. I'm a Prefect and he's going to have detention!"

I had heard what people were saying of Potter lately, for some reason they didn't believe what the kid said about that son of a bitch returning, Ugh, that what the most senseless shit I've heard in a long time! How the fuck did Cedric die then?

Sienna crossed her arms, angry at Hermione's response. What? Was I going to have Gryffindors standing for me after all these years? How bloody ironic.

"'Mione is okay. I can defend myself, don't worry." I assure her.

"Oh, piss off, Little Snape, would you?!" Plums complained.

"Oi, Sienna! Chill, mate." George Weasley intervened, still with his relaxed tone. He wasn't one of the pricks who laughed at that stupid joke, nor his twin who still didn't focus on me once since we arrived at Hogwarts again. What the fuck had someone to do to catch that prat's attention? I frowned my eyebrows as I looked at him still busy with Jordan, talking about something his twin and him were already planing about pranking stuff. "That 'Little Snape' joke is too overused, we're not 15-year-olds anymore."

Plums clicked her tongue, with disdain.

"Lilith! Are you gonna be on Slytherin's team this year?" George talked to me, calling everyone's attention looking at us with a surprised look. No one would expect any Gryffindor talking to me kindly, but a Weasley less than anyone else considering how his lovely brother loved to mess with me and the rivalry we had at the field.

"Yeah, will you on Gryffindor's?"

"S'pose so, if they finally give us the bloody practice schedule." he smiled and then joked, with kindness. "Guess we'll see each other's faces up in the air again."

I nodded, still puzzled for such nice behaviour, and went straight to one of the couches, where Draco was sitting quietly, giving a deadly stare at the Gryffindor lot while he had a Potions book in his hands. I sat next to him, already exhausted, and leaned back on the couch, crossed arms, hands inside the sleeves of the sweater of my uniform, letting my legs resting over his, as he caressed mine with clumsy pats while giving his attention back to the book.

"Do you have the Herbology book I asked you for?" I questioned after a while. Draco nodded and still in the position we were, grabbed one of the books next to him and handed it to me. I leaned back opening the book and tried to concentrate for a good couple of minutes but couldn't because I felt someone's eyes on me.

I lifted my head and wandered my look all over the library until my eyes met his. There he was.

Fred was trying to look discreetly at me, but he was actually failing catastrophically. His eyes were fixed right where Draco's hand was resting over the naked skin of my knees, scowling and running his fingers through his short ginger hair. I arched an eyebrow. Malfoy and I used to sit like this together lots of times when we were in the common room, the boy wasn't really fond of physical affection but sometimes we would just throw ourselves into each other's arms for some cuddles. It was a normal thing for the two of us, especially since we considered our relationship more like a little brother-big sister one. But almost no one knew that, though.

Fred's eyes went up on my body and we finally made eye contact for the first time since we arrived. He was trying not to show it but, even in the distance, I could see he was pissed off. The devilish part in my head lightened like a lighten sign and I felt it dancing in my brain of pure self-pride.

Could it be possible that Fred Weasley was jealous of Draco? Bloody hell, that was fun as fuck indeed, and I had the perfect plan to make it even better.

If Fred wants to ignore me, I'll let him know I don't need him.

"Draco." I started poking his cheek, the blond boy looked at me. "Can you get me some of Snape's notes of the Advanced Potions Book for Seven Year? I don't want to talk to him."

He sighed but nodded.

"Sure."

"Oh! You little sweet boy!" I joked, throwing myself to hug him tightly, making a bit of a mess on the couch and almost making my skirt go up. Draco got me between his arms, chuckling and trying to get rid of the cheek kisses I was giving him.

"Okay, okay, calm down!" he kept giggling, "What's going on, mate? I thought you only felt comfortable for cuddling in the common room."

That was kinda true. All the Slytherins knew how Draco and I worked since we tried to avoid affection in front of the Gryffindors so the uncomfortable rumours of him and I going out didn't grow and ruin our friendship.

"It's my last year at Hogwarts, mate. I don't give a fuck about anything anymore!" I announced, getting up and walking away, being conscient of Fred's eyes still on me, looking like if he wanted to kill me, or to fuck me. Only he knew. Before I left the library, I turned around to him, and really discreetly winked at him, making him take a deep breath.

Maybe it was childish of me, but the little devil inside of me was hella pleased and roaring for more.

Prepare yourself, Freddie. I've come to play.

( . . . )

The last class of today was nothing less than Defence Against the Dark Arts. Before going to sleep yesterday, I had the chance to ask Olivia how did it go.

"Horribly boring." she simply said, making a little pout.

Well, I loved DADA but maybe it was better for it to be boring than to be taught by the demented of Crouch Jr. I rubbed my eyes since barely had any sleep during the night thinking about Fred's look on Draco and me. I found the door of the class opened, with professor Umbridge sat at the desk with a cup of tea in front of her. There were already some Slytherins picking their seats, I chose one in the middle, close to windows.

"Good morning," I said while sitting. The woman gave me a quick up-to-down look and faked a smile. Weird.

Soon the class was full and once again, we had to share this subject with the Gryffindors so I wasn't surprised when I saw Fred sliding himself, lazy, careless and uninterested, in a seat a couple of rows behind me. His tie was badly tied, his shirt was a button or two opened and his hair was purposely messed.

"Good morning, everyone!" the old lady started with a kinda annoying high-pitched voice, a childish tone and an incredibly posh accent.

We all mumbled a lazy 'good morning' but she tutted.

"That is how you greet your new Professor? Come again, good morning class!"

"Good morning." we all say higher but still quite puzzled.

"That's better." she giggled and I found out her giggling was even more annoying than her voice. "Please, keep your wands in your bags and take out your books."

"The wands? Why?" A Slytherin boy asked.

"If you want to talk in my class, you'll have to raise your hand." her tone became rougher for a moment but then went back to that stupid and plastic smile.

The boy raised his hand already a bit annoyed.

"Yes, go on."

"How are we going to do magic with our wands in our pockets?"

"Oh, but this is a theoretical class, dear." another giggle. "I don't reckon why would you need to practice magic in here."

What the fuck is this woman on? DADA without magic?

"This year you will follow a programed system by the Ministry that will prepare you for the NEWTs."

I raised my hand, she looked at me again with that kinda grossed out eyes that tried to cover with her smile. I gave her an arrogant and quick up-to-down look as she did with me.

"Yes, miss..."

"Arambella."

"Yes, sure, go on."

"How are we going to pass the NEWTs if we don't do magic? This isn't Year 5, we're doing advanced magic that can go really wrong if we don't practice it as much as we can."

"If you study fully the theory there won't be any problem."

"But-"

"Miss Arambella." she interrupted me, trying to sound sweet. "This is a system approved by the Ministry, and sorry, but it looks like you, a simple girl who hasn't graduated yet, is trying to question it." that giggle again. "I am aware you are Professor Snape's niece, but I suggest you not to follow his tendency to go against the Ministry."

There we go again. Couldn't it be a year at Hogwarts without someone mentioning my position as Severus's niece, could it?

"What if we are attacked?"

"Why on Earth would be such a sweet group of kids attacked during my class?"

"It's DADA. We have to go against the Dark Arts. Practice defensive spells and all that." A Gryff protested, pretty obvious.

"Your hand!" she warned. "It is not my intention to criticize any of your previous docents but you were taught by some pretty irresponsible wizards, not to mention some extremely dangerous hybrids."

"If it's Professor Lupin who you are talking about, you should stop yourself right there, professor. Remus was the best teacher we ever had." I stated, making my tone colder. I could be a real Snape if I wanted to.

"Miss Arambella, raise your hand! I will not say it again. And I reckon my predecessor not only practised unforgivable curses in front of you but also practised them on you."

I moved in my chair, uncomfortable, as I felt the chills covering my body at the memory of the Imperio curse on me.

"That will not happen in my class, and to avoid those situations there will not be magic at all." she smiled again.

"Fucking bullshit." I heard Fred whisper, making his twin and other mates nod silently.

"Excuse me, Mr Weasley? What did you say?" Umbridge spoke, walking closer to Fred with her stone-cold eyes looking at him but that fake smile on her face.

"Nothing, professor. I didn't have my hand raised." he excused himself, looking at the unbearable lady in the eye with an amused smile, moving one of his legs repeatedly.

"That's what I thought," Umbridge murmured, with warning eyes.

After two entire hours of coping some shit from the bloody book that no one could understand, she finally let us go. Shit, DADA was getting ruined for me and it was all these bloody professors' fault. If only Remus was here...

Once we all made it out of there, we went straight to the Hall. I met Draco at the Slytherin table, accompanied by Blaise and quickly told them about Umbridge. Blaise didn't seem to fancy her too much either but Draco wasn't that bothered about her.

"She's not that bad."

"Draco, mate, better keep drinking your apple juice, let Blaise and me talk like the elders we are," I said driving the straw straight to his mouth to hush him a bit aggressively.

My eyes looked behind Blaise and a familiar couple of brown ones were once again staring at me. Fred had the fork hanging off his hand, with an inexpensive face but an annoyed stare.

I raised an eyebrow to him, with an arrogant smile, challenging him. He snorted, fakely chuckling, and went back to the conversation with his mates at the table, but it didn't escape to my eyes how he clenched his jaw and how he bit his tongue.

I was playing with fire and I wanted him to burn me.

Two weeks went on since we started the new course. I already had my first class with Severus but decided to keep ignoring him and get my work done, even though he insisted on being the focus of my anger.

"Are you telling me you're going to waste your future in that stupid sport?!" he hissed, once I told him about my plans after school. It wasn't like I wanted him to know, but the Year 7 procedure made us talk to the heads of our houses to have advice about our careers. Of course, he didn't approve mine.

Not that I cared about his opinion, though.

The Quidditch teams were preparing their training and schedules and the Gryffindor team was especially irascible. Angelina Johnson, the new captain and one of the few players I had respect for, was cursing all over the corridor since she had to do the test for the team's new guardian alone because Potter got himself in trouble with Umbridge. That was a win for my team though, having Gryffindor without one of their players yet and their best shot being punished and not training gave us a bit of advantage. My team was consolidated and stronger than last year, even though we were still far from our past glory.

I was sitting on one of the walls, leaned against a column, smoking one of the few cigs I had left, with Liv by my side staring at the trees from the garden, while the students were going all over the corridor or staying in little groups.

"Where are you going to get the cigs from now?" Liv asked, taking the cigarette from my fingers and giving a puff.

"I sent Iris to Remus, asking him to deliver me the packs Sirius has at home. He doesn't smoke that same brand so I can have them."

Every time I had a cigarette at school I couldn't help but remember Ced. I still felt a huge emptiness inside of me when I thought about him but the anger and the hunger to avenge him made me keep going.

"Can Dumbledore allow you to do that?"

"Not if I were underage, but I'm not, so as long as I don't smoke inside the classes..."

"Pauline tried to make me drop it," she said, looking at the little ashes on the grass and playing with them with her feet. "But I ended up just smoking less, you should try too, Lilith."

Liv handed me the cig and I made it hung on my lips as I opened one of my books to revise the notes from the previous class.

"Nah, I'm fine."

"Arambella! Lovegood!" I heard a voice chanting. One of the Gryffindors of my course, accompanied by a bunch of Ravenclaws. Liv turned around to face him, tensed, and I raised my head with an eyebrow already raised and my meanest face. "Good to see you together, girls!"

"What do you want, Alton?" I recognized him. He was the boy I cursed wandless last year.

"Just wondering how you gonna enter the Slytherin team this year without any of the old captains to suck their prick and assure you a position."

I breathed deeply. With the cig still on my lips and squeezing the book in my hands. I didn't know why but lately, the Gryffs had their eyes even more on me and for some bloody reason, they were starting to mess with my Quidditch position in the Slytherin team. Maybe my mother's card was already too overplayed.

"Watch your mouth, mate," I warned him. Liv already had her hand around my wrist. "I'm the best Beater you'll ever see in this school."

"Oh, wait, true! You have uncle Snape to get you on the team, don't you? So maybe sucking cocks is more a hobby by now."

I took my wand out of my pocket and pointed at him, taking Liv's hand from me, in less than three seconds.

"Atabraquium!" I cursed him, and he fell to the floor with both hands and feet tied. He seemed scared. "What happened, Alton? Not so brave now?"

He spat in the ground in front of me, trying to look brave. But I knew he was only pretending.

A little circle of students formed around us.

"Lilith..."Liv called me. "Don't get yourself in trouble."

"Don't worry, Liv. I'm just giving a lesson." I ironized, approaching Alton.

His mates tried to run to help him, but I threatened them pointing with my wand while the Slytherins were laughing and the other Gryffindors were trying to stay out of business, he wasn't pretty appreciated by his house. I turned around and saw Liv looking at me trying to hold her smile and give me a severe look, but I bowed like if I just had made a theatrical function.

"Miss Arambella!" I heard a high-peached feminine voice. At first, I thought it was McGonagall but soon I found Umbridge looking at me with severe cold blue eyes, in her entire pink outfit, with her childish attitude as usual. "What do you think you are doing?"

I was about to answer with something witty and sarcastic, but she interrupted me.

"I don't want to hear it. You have detention this Friday at four, being Professor Snape's niece will not stop you from getting the discipline you need. Also, I don't want you smoking in this school! That will add an extra hour to your punishment!"

"But I have Quidditch practice!" I complained, she could have picked any other day at any other hour but it had to be precisely Friday, of course.

"That's not my concern, dear. Better think about your actions next time," she said, faking a pout and walked away.

I sighed hard and clicked my tongue, stepping on the cigarette.

"What I told you about getting in trouble?" Liv said, tangling her arm with mine. "Come on, let's go to my common room. I still have some blueberry candy I bought in Paris."

Oh, Olivia, you did know how to cheer me up.

✵ ✵ ✵

"Lilith! You already had the first practice?" a girl from a younger course from mine, talked as I entered the Slytherin common room. Liv and I spent a couple of hours together doing some homework and eating pastries but she was too tired because of the long day she had so I let her take a nap and came back to my place, playing with a new bracelet on my wrist. Olivia was obsessed with handmade jewellery now that Pauline taught her how to make them during their time in France.

"Nah, I still haven't got the schedule." I sat down in one of the large dark green velvet couches. "This year are getting later than usual."

"Well, I hope you get in the field soon. One of the bloody Weasleys was talking about how much they would fuck you all over at the Quidditch match. What a dickhead!"

Wait a minute...

I stood up like a shot. "Who said that?"

"One of those annoying twins," she replied a bit confused and still bothered.

"You know which one?"

"Yeah, I think it was this Fred one..."

I didn't let her finish the sentence but took my wand and walked out of the common room, feeling the rage and anger forming inside of me. I was so pissed off, maybe because of today's incident, maybe because it was precisely Fred who said it, maybe because I was tired of having people questioning the only thing I had a passion for, but I was fucking pissed off and I had already a perfect plan in my head.

"Neville." I found the boy outside in the garden, observing some plants. Tried my best to soften my tone as I approach him. The poor boy had nothing to do with the idiots of his housemates. "Can you give me the Gryffindor password?"

"What? Why do you need it?" he sounded pretty confused and not too convinced.

"Need to talk to Weasley."

I must have sounded too harsh because he took a little paper from his pocket and handed it to me, looking a bit scared.

"Thanks, mate." I simply said, already walking away, letting my feet take control as my mind was blank because of the anger.

Between all the things Gryffindors could mess with me for, they chose the only thing that I truly worked for. Being in the Slytherin team took me a lot of training, Severus being against it, and a lot of hours learning about the sport and not only the technique. Beating the Bludger was a not-too-healthy therapeutical way of releasing my anger without harm and everyone in my house knew how serious I took my position as a player.

But also, Fred didn't talk to me once in all these days. He did not mention the Slytherin team, me nor anything about the match until now and the fact that he made it precisely now just to say such bullshit, boiled my blood even more.

Five minutes later, I was in front of the Fat Lady's portrait. She looked at me puzzled.

"What is a Slyther-"

"Mimbulus Mimbletonia, " I interrupted her with the password in Neville's paper. She couldn't prevent me from getting inside and I didn't wait anymore. Entering the place, I found a cosy room, with a fireplace, red and golden motives and some Gryffindors chatting. I was venturing in the lion's den but no place in my body doubted once.

Luckily for me, one of the Gryffindors was George so I basically ran into him, taking him apart from his mates, who, of course, gave me deadly stares.

"Lilith, what are you doing h-?"

"Where's your brother?" I spoke over him.

George scowled, with a little smile on his face showing how confused he was.

"In our room, w-?

"Where's your room?" I kept interrupting him.

"Wait, can you tell me what is going on?"

"I need to teach him to hold his fucking tongue. Where's your room, George?"

"Left stairs, the fifth one," he replied, a bit intimidated but still amused.

"Is he alone?"

"Yeah, he's taking a shower, the rest of us are going to the Hall, I told him I'd see him there."

"Thanks, make sure no one enters the room."

"Wait, are you two going to shag again?" he asked, more amused. "Can I stay?" he joked, or not. You never know with George Weasley.

"See you later, Georgie." I smiled, winking at him.

"As you command, my captain," he chuckled as I started going upstairs, practically running.

Once I found the room, I opened it without knocking first and entered, slamming the door behind me. Fred lifted his eyes as soon as I got in the dorm, and observed me, intrigued. He was putting a white short towel around his hips, with his hair freshly dried and messy, and with no shirt on, giving me a good view of his skin covered in moles, freckles and scars, and his kinda defined muscles.

"Muffliato!" I cast at the door, still making eye contact with him

"What're you doing in here?" he asked, clenching his jaw but trying to look and sound deadpan.

"Oh, so now you talk to me!" I ironized, already miffed. "Thought you could only use your mouth for throwing rubbish."

"What are you even saying?" he clicked his tongue, annoyed. Trying to reach his underwear which was in the nightstand behind me, but I put myself in between, arms crossed, staring at him. "What d'you want, Lilith? You didn't seem to give a fuck about me not talking to you the other day at the library, so could you piss off?"

So that was the heart of the matter. Jealousy. Great.

I grinned.

"Aw, Freddie." I softened my tone and lowered my voice, walking closer to him. He took a deep breath, retaining the air, and raising his head a bit, almost unnoticeable. " I'd piss off if you learnt to hold your fucking tongue but I suppose you haven't fucked in so long you can't avoid behaving like a wanker, right, darling?"

Our breaths were mixing, his eyes went straight to my lips and I noticed how he was clenching his jaw. I extended my hand to his neck and caressed the part where it connected with his back, making us go closer, knowing damn well that he was naked below that towel. Soon, his characteristic smirk appeared on his face as he narrowed his eyes.

"Who's acting like a wanker now, love?" Fred murmured sarcastic, giving me goosebumps and quivers, passing his hands around my waist, and slamming my body against his. I held a gasp back when I felt his hard dick against me through that bloody towel. Fuck. "I bet you miss me fucking you more than I do."

We kept staring at each other's eyes with no words, challenging. Lowering my eyes to his lips, I finally gave up and trapped his lower one with my teeth, softly and then, let it go. His hands travelled inside my skirt to caress my bum and I put my arms around his neck.

He breathed even deeper and closed his eyes, grabbing me even harder.

His lips met mine in a slow and torturing way, far from being sweet, it was intense, burning, intimate, building a whole bonfire inside of me. Fred separated, letting himself fall with grace on his bed, arms behind his head, with his eyes still on me, challenging. Holding his look, I took off my shirt, slowly, making sure he was observing every single move I made, then I pulled down my uniform skirt. His eyes covered every inch of my body that was exposed and his chest went up and down more deeply. It was my time to play.

Quicker than before, I retired my underwear, under his brown eyes full of desire, and went in his encounter, straddling his hips, with only the towel preventing us from feeling ourselves completely, and starting to slightly rub against him. He slowly caressed my hip.

"How can you be so beautiful?" he murmured, with a raspy voice, moving his hands up, trying to get to my breasts.

"I'm the one in charge today okay, Freddie?"

He nodded with the tips of his fingers grazing my skin. But I had other plans for us, so I grabbed his wrists and lifted his arms above his head, against the bed.

He looked at me surprised and I smirked at him, making his brown eyes go darker and feeling the desire growing in him, below me.

"Keep your hands like that."

"Are going to punish me, darling?" he teased but obeyed as I got back to my position.

"Mmh, I'm doing more than that, Freddie," I whispered, moving my hips, feeling him gasp and go even harder as he leaned his head back.

I lowered myself to kiss him, with his tongue playing with mine and the warmth coming from his skin, I moved my lips from his mouth to his neck, sucking and biting while still rocking my hips slowly, torturing him and myself in the way. He let a little moan escape and tried to touch my leg, but I put back his hand to the same position and I felt him giggle.

"Oh, so you're not letting me touch you."

I shook my head slowly, going up again taking off the towel from his hips, having him completely exposed. I bit my lip and started to give kisses all over his chest until I reached the little but pretty noticeable veins in his hips. He held his breath and closed his eyes.

"Lilith..." he whispered still with that raspy voice that was driving me crazy, moving his hips, begging silently.

"What do you want, Freddie?"

We made eye contact and I smiled at him arrogantly and then passed the tip of my tongue slowly from one of his hip bones to the other making sure I was just a couple of centimetres away from where he wanted to feel me. He groaned, taking his eyes from mine.

"Don't play with me."

I laughed devilishly, and moved back to the same position, rubbing against his pulsating dick, now feeling him completely and making sure it was well lubricated. His tip made contact with my entrance and with the help of my hand I let it in, pushing my body down until I had him entirely inside. Fuck, he felt so good.

We both moaned at the same time, breathing the hot air in the room, and moving in little circles to let myself get used to his size. I put my hands over his chest and started moving, making him go deeper inside of me.

"Mmh, Lilith..." he whined biting his lip and closing his eyes. His hands, with the veins on them more marked than ever, went straight to my hips to squeeze me and to guide my movement. "Fucking hell, your pussy feels even better than the last time."

Taking advantage of me being on top, I took my wand from the pocket of my skirt, which was laid by our side, and started to make my hips move faster and deeper, feeling him in every inch of me. Riding him. Fred Weasley was burning me and I couldn't be more pleased with it.

Discreetly, I moved my wand near to him and while kissing, noticing how he was struggling to keep the rhythm and to catch air properly, I pressed my wand horizontally against his neck.

He looked at me with his eyes opened widely, more turned on as I lifted myself, riding him rougher and faster. Damn it, that was good.

"Who is fucking who now, Weasley?" I mumbled, still panting because of the amount of pressure between my legs and how hard he was entering. Every nerve in my body was at its maximum of sensitivity and our moans were mixing in a hypnotic melody.

He smiled and his hands got deeper in my hips, probably leaving me marks but I couldn't care less.

"Oh, Lilith, you are going to end me," he murmured in response but didn't try to put the wand away. I put it more against his skin, he swallowed hard.

His words were like a drug to me so I kept riding him, going more deeper, and faster, feeling the tension already forming in my guts with my wand still against his neck.

I let out a messy cry as I felt his tip pushing harder my most sensitive spot inside of me, and Fred moaned even harder, grabbing the headboard of his bed, staring right where our bodies were becoming one. Noticing his breathing became messier and he was already about to finish, I took the wand from his neck and with my body complaining about it, I made him go out of me.

He complained, with a frustrated noise.

"What are you doing?" he said with a hoarse voice, worried. "Did I hurt you?"

"Are you going to stop behaving like a bloody son of a bitch once we're out the bed, Freddie?" I asked, tempting him, passing my thumb over his lower lip and making him smirk and touch it with the tip of his tongue. I felt the tingles concentrating in my clit but I had to prove myself better and not succumb to him. Not going to lie, it was hard. He was a heavenly view.

"What are you gonna do if I don't, darling?" he temped me, starting to stroke himself, with his eyes still on mine. Fuck...how could he be so attractive?

"You will have to cum by yourself, dear," I warned him, then, started to leave kisses in his jawline. He leaned his head back, giving me free access and letting out a little moan.

"Whatever you want, Lilith," he complained, growling, but still with that arrogant smile. "I know you want to finish too..."

Finally giving up, and still making eye contact with him, I took his hand off his dick and made it enter inside of me again in just one sit. Making the two of us moan again.

"Fuck..." I cried out, feeling even more sensitive than before. I could get used to this mixture of pain and pleasure...

Raising himself to kiss my neck, Fred sucked and bit my skin slowly, just the opposite as how I was pushing him inside of me. Little by little, I sensed him touching that soft spot again. He grabbed my bum and made me go against his body as he leaned back. Every part of our bodies was touching and he started to take control of the movements, making them faster, deeper and rougher. I moaned against his lips.

"Cum for me, Freddie..." I whispered against his lips, synchronizing the movement of my hips with his. The tension was almost unbearable and I already felt myself struggling to catch the air as the orgasm started to invade me.

I tightened myself around him, making him moan even louder against my mouth, trying to drown it.

"Oh, Lilith..." he pressed his hands on my hips harder as I dug my nails in his chest, scratching him almost until his hips as I felt the orgasm invading me. "Such a good girl, coming just for me..."

I whimpered against the skin of his neck, with the chills covering my body violently and he moaned. The blood in my veins burnt and my head was dizzy. He pushed once more, harder, feeling my orgasm around him, getting to an end and let himself cum inside of me, with one last groan making me gasp again.

Fuck.

I let myself fall in his chest to catch air again and he caressed softly my back, trying to normalize his breathing.

"Fuck, Lilith, if all our fights are gonna be like this, I think I'll have to be a dickhead again."

I snickered against his neck, breathing deeply.

I wouldn't mind fighting with him either if this is how wewouldend...

After a couple of minutes catching air again, I finally stood up to pull my clothes, with very weak and trembling legs. I tried to hide the fact sitting again but Fred chuckled."You good?" he asked sarcastically, looking at me with using his arms as a pillow and with an arrogant smile. The white sheet was only covering that place in his hips, showing him as some kind of Greek god."Yeah, I'm good. Don't get too cocky." I replied, forcing myself to stand up even though I felt my legs failing and the pain forming in between my legs.Fred burst into laughter. "Only you, Lilith Arambella, could try to walk normally after being fucked hard.""Not that hard." I teased him and he snorted, incredulous and pretending to be offended."Oh, really? Don't worry, dear, I promise you next time you won't be walking in a couple of days."Next time...he was saying there will be one next time. I tried to keep it together."We will see about that.""See you tomorrow in Charms?" he asked quickly when I opened the door ready to leave."Don't think so, too early, maybe I stay sleeping.""In the Quidditch training then? I pretend to make you fall off your broom.""Keep dreaming with that, mate. But no," I snorted, remembering the morning incident. "I have to stay with Umbridge.""Oh, are you serious? Ha! Uncle Snape must be fuming with his beautiful little niece getting in trouble." Fred joked running his fingers through his hair, exposing a little bit more of his skin. Damn. "What did you do?""Curse a Gryffindor for not holding his tongue," I replied, proudly, before closing the door, leaving him with an amused expression on his face.✵ ✵ ✵"Lilith! Look, the mail!" Liv said, running to the Slytherin table where I was sitting next to Blaise. She was even more excited than me, even though it was my first time receiving it, probably because she was getting a letter from Pauline.Iris landed in front of me leaving me a little box and a piece of paper tied to her tiny foot. I caressed her while grabbing what she got me. It was a pack of cigarettes I quickly hid in my pocket and a note from Remus.Hello, dear! Hope your first days at Hogwarts are going well! Just knewUmbridgeis your professor of DADA, please don't get in trouble with her.I sent you one of the packs you asked me for and I hope I can send your birthday gift soon.

Tonks and I miss you lots! Sirius sends hugs too.

-Remus

I was so happy about seeing that they still cared about me that I kept the note in my pocket as well, probably would hang it in my room. I let Iris go, and continued having breakfast knowing that in the afternoon I had the detention with Umbridge.Ugh, Remus, if you knew I already got myself in trouble with that bitch...She was getting more and more power inside the school even though she was supposed to be only a teacher, but because of the Ministery's new rules, she was supervising the school and some people even said she might be named Head Mistress.Dumbledore wasn't exactly my cup of tea but he was far way better than her."How's the love letter?" I asked Liv once I noticed how she was blushing and biting her lip while reading it. She sighed and pressed the note against her chest."Lovely, just like her.""Aw, I'm just going to forgive that cheesy comment just because it's Pauline who you are talking about and because you two are my favourite couple.""Got Potions now, might use the hour to write her back a letter, what about you?" Liv asked standing up from the table while a bunch of Slytherins were giving her deadly stares. I looked at them with an eyebrow raised, challenging."Herbology." I snorted. Professor Sprout was nice and everything, but her subject was unbearable. I stood up from the table grabbing my bag, patted Blaise's shoulder kindly and gave Liv a cheek kiss, ready to leave the Hall.When I was stepping out in the corridor, I almost crashed into Draco."You've got detention, don't you?" he complained. "Who's gonna substitute you in today's training, huh? I thought I told you not to mess with Umbridge."I frowned my eyebrows, smiling and messed his hair gaining a complaining noise as a response."You won't need me today, we have to practise mainly with the new Chasers, and since when do I listen to you, Draco?""Touché." he poked my waist hardly, tingling me, and trying to hold back his laugh.He walked away and I found Fred's eyes staring at me from across the corridor, with both his eyebrows raised and a little smile that was far away from being amused in his face. As I passed in front of him, I gave him a little wink.✵ ✵ ✵"Come in, Miss Arambella." I heard Umbridge's horrible voice speak right after I knocked in her office.I entered and found Remus's and the false Mad-Eye's office transformed in a naff completely pink room with plates decorating the walls and Umbridge sitting at her desk, drinking what seemed to be one of the most disgusting teas I ever smelled.I sat, lazy, in front of her and let out a long sigh."What I have to do, professor?She leaned her head to the left a little bit as if I was a weird creature she just found."Oh, yes, dear. You will have to copy some sentences for me. I'm glad that you are not trying to apologise for your behaviour as Mr Potter did, I see at least you know how wrong and reckless is to practice a curse over another student and how similar that makes you to your family, we don't want that, do we?" she fakely smiled. I clenched my fists, feeling the blood in my veins going cold like ice."No, professor, we don't." I managed to respond, staying calm.She took from one of her drawers a piece of paper and a long black quill the end extremely sharp."Excuse me, but where's the ink?""Oh, dear, do not worry," she giggled again. I took a deep breath to prevent myself from being expelled because of physically attacking a professor. "You won't need it. I want you to copy these two sentences 'I will not smoke at school ' and 'I will not curse '. Understood?"I rolled my eyes discreetly and nodded."How many times?""As much as needed to get the message clear," she replied, sipping her tea quite noisily. "You can start."I put the quill over the paper and wrote the first sentence but I felt a cut on the skin of my hand and I hissed of pain. The words 'I will not smoke at school ' with my handwriting appeared in the paper with a strong scarlet red colour and at the same time, it did appear in my right hand. They were engraved in my skin as clumsy and sharp cuts. It quickly healed and the sentence disappeared, leaving my skin redder.I raised my head incredulous, looking at her, scowling. What kind of magic was that?Umbridge had her cup of tea in the midway to her mouth and was forcing a sweet smile. Bloody bitch..."Yes, dear?"I shook my head, unable to speak, knowing that if I did, I'd probably curse her one of the nasty ones. I wrote ' I will not curse ' and the sentence appeared this time in my left hand. I snorted silently, moving my hand to make the pain less hard.I kept writing and writing until the sentences were engraved in my two hands. The pain was the same I experimented when my mother tried to etch the dark mark in my arm, and the quill's cuts felt as sharp and deep as her nails. Almost two hours later, she finally talked again, taking me out of the daydream where I was mentally naming all the curses I could throw at her and how they would affect her while I continued opening my hands."Alright, I think that would be enough for today," she spoke, looking at me with those shallow eyes. "Your hands, please."I doubted for a second, but she grabbed my wrists not too carefully and ran her thumbs over my fresh scars, I tightened my lips to restrain me from hissing."Off you go, Ms Arambella." she let me go. I grabbed my bag and left the office slamming the door behind me.Since the corridor was empty, I let myself hiss and wipe out a tear that threatening to leave my eyes as I inspected the scars. They weren't as deep and poorly done as the one my mother gave me so probably, they would disappear in a few days, even though at the moment they hurt and itched.When I was about to go straight to the Slytherin common room, I found Blaise sitting outside, doing his Potions task."You might not want to enter in there," he said, calling my attention."Why?" I hid my hands, making sure he didn't see the scars."Your uncle is in there. I heard you don't want to see him."I made a noise, complaining."Yeah, I don't. Thanks for telling me, mate."I turned around walking in the opposite direction, to the library. Once I got in there, I found Draco sitting on one side of the most isolated couches, and Liv on the other one. They both were immersed in their own books. I sat furiously in between them and crossed my arms and my legs, still fuming."How did it went?" Liv asked, putting her hand on my thigh."Terrible. That bitch is a fucking torturer." I mumbled, showing her the scars, trying not to call the other people in the library's attention.Liv's blue eyes opened widely and she grabbed my hands and caressed the wounds."What is wrong with her?" she spoke, disturbed. "She can't do this.""Well, she did it," I responded, leaning my head on Draco's lap and my legs on Liv's. Draco stopped reading to give a look to my hands and I saw him scowling while Liv tutted."You should talk to Snape," he said, sounding quite uninterested."Yeah, 'cause he solved Moody's problem very well, right?" I ironized and then clenched my jaw. The wounds didn't heal yet and they were starting to itch and hurt more."Talk to Dumbledore then, he has to do something. You can't allow this, it is torture!" Liv whispered."That old fool will not care, Liv. It doesn't matter, they will heal, you'll see.""Lilith..." she complained."What are you reading?" I interrupted her, trying to change the topic. Draco went back to his book while playing with the bracelet in my arm.Suddenly, I heard how someone threw something at the floor, right in front where we were, and before I could give it a look, a little firework with blue and orange colours exploded in front of us, making the three of us stand up, quite scared at first, and burning a few hairs in Draco's head.Who the fuck...?I raised my head and saw George and Lee Jordan giggling between them, while Fred was trying to hold his laugh and was looking at me, amused."Sorry, Arambella, we didn't intend to send the firework there. We are testing some ideas for future pranks."I clicked my tongue, giving him a deadly stare. Normally, Fred and George's pranks and games were the one thing it didn't bother me from the Gryffindors, actually, I enjoyed them a lot silently, but today was not my day. Not when the wounds were still bright red and the pain was feeling exactly like the one I suffered when I got my forearm scar."Don't piss me off today, Weasley, I'm not in the mood for your jokes," I warned him, walking in his direction.He looked at me, slightly frowning his eyebrows."You complaining about my jokes? What happened to you? Is Malfoy ruining the little sense of humour you had?""Oh, fuck off, would you?" I complained, already tired, trying to walk back to Liv but Fred's hand trapped my wrist and made me walk to one of the empty corridors in the library. He slammed me against one of the shelves, with a dimly light surrounding us, making some of the books almost fall."Are you trying to fight again, Lilith? You miss me that much?" He teased approaching me but keeping the distance between our bodies.I looked at him, unexpressive."No, Weasley, I just don't want to deal with your games today.""Come on, you know you love my games." he tried to come closer to me, but I stopped him putting one of my arms in his chest and putting more distance."Fuck o-""What is this?" he interrupted me when he glanced my hand over him and distinguished the scars, going suddenly and surprisingly serious. He trapped my hand before I could take it away."Nothing." I tried to say, while he passed his thumb softly through the fresh wound of 'I will not smoke in the school '.This time I couldn't help but hiss."Don't lie to me. You had detention with Umbridge, she did this to you?" he tried to sound deadpan but I could sense the anger in his voice.I nodded, taking my hand softly away from his grip."Why?""I dunno, she made me copy this one with a weird inkless quill and it got in my hand, I also have a scar in the other one." I showed him my left hand, and he scowled, slowly shaking his head.He looked at me and his dark brown eyes softened."A couple of scars more to the lot," he said with sarcasm, smiling a little bit. "It's already dark outside, wanna share a cig in the Garden?""Right there where Umbridge can see us if she gets out of her office?" I asked, imitating his tone. "You tempt me, Mr Weasley."He snickered a little bit and then raised his eyebrows."She won't be coming down, and come on, don't tell me that bitch is going to soften you..."I smiled arrogantly, "She won't."He smirked and I had to force me not to bite my lip, with my nerves on edge."Let's go then." I walked back to the couch where Draco was gone while Liv was talking really entertained with some mates from her house."Liv, I'm going to the Garden to smoke, wanna come?""Of course you are going to break the rules again." she chuckled, standing up and hugging me tightly. "But no, thanks, I'm fine here, you want me to go to your dorm later? We can sleep together.""Yes, please!" we kissed each other's cheek and then I followed Fred out of the library, not without missing George winking at the two of us. I winked back at him, smiling because I couldn't focus my anger on Georgie.The corridors were as empty as before, and I had to walk faster than usual since Fred's steps were bigger than mine, quietly to keep the silence in the atmosphere. After a while we got in front of the biggest tree in the Garden, one of its branches was lower and thicker than the rest, so we climbed it and sat there, next to each other, with our feet hanging in the air, with the other limbs and leaves covering our backs and hiding us.I took my pack out of my pocket and handed him one of my cigs but he shook his head, taking his hand to his pocket."Got my own!" he announced, shaking the box in front of me."About time!" I said, looking at how he took one of the cigs from his pack and slowly put it in his lips, leaving it hanging.I shook my head discreetly. I had to stop looking at him as a creep. "Pass me the lighter, please."I did so while repeating his actions and looking by the corner of my eye how he lightened his cig with precision, making the little flame illuminate his face, and clenching his jaw. He handed it back to me and I lightened mine.We breathed and let the smoke out at the same time, right there, under the unpolluted night sky with a starry ocean, a crescent moon, in complete silence and with our legs touching.Enjoying the moment.

 Umbridge was the new High Inquisitor of Hogwarts - if that sort of title actually existed. And I was fucking pissed off about it.  Not only she announced she was about to start to assist all of our classes to test our professors but also started to form new useless and ridiculous rules that really had me on my nerves, and what was Dumbledore doing about it? Absolutely nothing.  "Are you worried about how she can test Snape?" Liv questioned while we entered the old not-used bathroom as I sat in one of the sinks. I've missed this place.  "No, she can irritate him a lot but he has enough cold blood. He won't say anything reckless." "He's not like you..." she joked. "And honestly, I couldn't care less about anything related to Severus." I continued, ignoring her comment. "I still haven't forgotten how he threatened to send me to Azkaban when I cursed Crouch." "Yeah, that was really unfair." "You know who I want that bitch to try to test? McGonagall." I chuckled. "I bet Umbridge has nothing to do against old Minnie. I'll have to ask Hermione later how did it go 'cause Umbridge won't be doing it in our class but in hers, she wants to keep Potter under control." Liv sat on the floor, with her eyes a bit lost as she tutted. "I've heard she's trying to punish the other kids as she did with you. I only hope Luna doesn't get in trouble, I don't want my little sister to go through that torture." "I know, but there isn't anything we can do against her, is it?" I saw her playing with a little piece of paper that was full of highlights of bright colours. The Pauline Letter. I smiled. "How's everything going with our favourite French girl?" I asked, rocking my legs, leaving them hanging a little bit over the floor.  "I need to send her a letter asking for her birth time, I want Luna to compare our natal charts and tell us our compatibility." the blonde girl, replied playing with one of her bracelets, the one Pauline did for her, blushing but with a smile lightening her face. "You know Astronomy is Luna's thing." Liv's way to love reminded me of a candle's light. She was there for you, showing her love every single day with little details and shows of affection but she didn't need to shout it to the world. She was persistent, dedicated and soft and I wished more people had such a pure understanding of emotions as she did. "Do you miss her?" She sighed, still smiley, "Every single day, more and more. I don't even know in what moment I started to love her and need her this much." I couldn't help but feel a huge feeling of tenderness and urge to see the two of them together and happy, they were doing well with the long-distance relationship but it was far away from being the same as being able to see, touch, kiss and feel each other. "What about you and Weasley?" Liv asked raising her eyebrows, and I almost choked with my own saliva. "Me and who?!" "Come on, Lilith. You don't have to pretend with me, I know you too well not to know you have a thing with him." "I already told you I fucked him a week ago." "And that's it?" "Should it be more?" She sighed again, frustrated but amused. "Don't you like him at least a bit?" I tightened my lips, considering the question. I did feel attracted to him, I craved his touch and I spend a lot of time, more than I would like to admit, thinking about him but, liking him? That sounded too much for me, and not even think about stronger feelings. Those were definitely off the table for me. "I don't think so." "You sure? I mean, he has been quite rude to you in the past, but people change and he seems to be more mature now." "Mature? Weasley?" I joked, trying to divert the topic. She rolled her eyes, laughing. "I don't know, Liv. The only person I've seen romantically before was Ced and I didn't love him fully, I liked him a lot, he was my first teenager love, but I didn't love him and the way I feel about Fred is very different. I think I've never loved anyone properly in that way." "You haven't because you are scared they are going to abandon you as Ares did," she whispered, making me swallow hard. Maybe she knew me too well. "Or to hurt you, like Circe." Shit, Olivia. "Maybe because the only person I have felt actual love for and who hasn't abandoned me is you and we are like sisters so it doesn't even count." "Not everyone will hurt you," she said grabbing my hand and caressing it. "You deserve to be loved, mate. Don't close your doors." I chewed my lower lip, still considering her words and feeling a huge fight inside of me. I had enough pain. For this life and another one more. "I do know I like how the hate has become sexual tension, though, and I like fucking him. That's something, isn't it?"  "I don't know, is it to you?" she continued with her inquisitive smile and look, trying to read me. "Fucking hell, Olivia, sometimes I swear you sound like a bloody muggle therapist..." ✵ ✵ ✵ The Fifth Year students were panicking about their OWLs and I couldn't blame them. Every single place in the castle was full of students already crying because of the exams even though we were months apart from them, so I wasn't surprised when I entered the library searching for a special book for Transfiguration and found every couch and table full of people. My eyes met Fred's for a minute as I saw him and his twin trying to convince a kid from Ronald's class to have a weird sweet they were preparing. He had a little smile on his face and his typical mischievous bright in his eyes, I felt my heart hitting against my chest and the beat in my head, the air became slightly heavier and my mouth went a bit dry as I started to remember Liv's words and the effect they had on me. I could not fancy Fred Weasley.  I gave a quick gaze back to him but he was busy talking to Sienna Plums, they weren't as close as before but lots of people in Gryffindor had bets on how much it would take them to start dating. Trying to pretend it didn't anger the devilish and primitive part of myself, I ignored them and after seeing Draco chatting with Blaise and a couple of Slytherins of his year, I quickly approached him. "Morning, boys."  Draco quickly raised his head and his serious expression calmed. "Lilith! How are you? Wanna sit with us?" "I'd like to, but your table's full. Don't worry, though, I only need a book for McGonagall." "Oh, no, but Crabbe can let you his seat, he was going to leave anyway." "No, I wasn't!" the mentioned boy protested. "Yes, you were. Shut up." Malfoy corrected him with an aristocratic tone, trying to show how he had power over him. "Draco, leave the poor kid, he has to study. I'm fine." I replied, patting the blonde's shoulders.  "Wait, you can sit on my lap if you want to." He interrupted, with his eyes fixed on the Gryffindor table, I scowled when he finished his proposition. "Maybe you can help me with this potion." Draco was one of the best students in Potions. I followed his eyes' direction and he was looking at a distracted and kinda disheartened Potter. I chuckled but my eyes moved a little bit in the Gryffindor table, Fred was staring at me, curiously, clenching his jaw, even though the way he was sitting was quite relaxed, lazy and even arrogant, moving slowly one of his legs while his twin beside him was reading him a weird list I couldn't hear. I felt the tingles already forming in my guts and my blood burning. "Yeah, sure, let me see," I said, faking that I wasn't noticing Weasley's eyes on me. I sat carefully on Draco's leg, crossing my legs and feeling a bit overwhelmed by the smell of his expensive cologne.  "Haven't you heard about Umbridge's new rule about boys and girls not being able to be near each other unless there are a good couple of inches between them?" Blaise joked, closing the book in front of him and playing with the silver rings in his fingers. "That's the fun part, Zabini. Imagine that bitch's face when she sees no one cares about her stupid rules." I winked at him. "Wait, let me write what I don't understand." Draco started a bit too high, catching the sharp pencil between his thin and long pale fingers. I think something's happening with Potter. He wrote next to one of the formulas. I picked the pencil from his hands: what do you mean? He has the same scars that you in his hands.  I heard he got himself in trouble with Umbridge, do you care that much, Draco? I heard him snort as he read the line I wrote and shook his head discreetly. I don't. I'm just trying to know if he is planning something. I snickered. Whatever Draco felt for Harry was way more confusing and disturbing than whatever I felt for Weasley, and if Draco kept being such a bitch to that boy and his friends it would never go any further than this claimed and public-known hate they professed for each other. Also, poor Potter had his shiny green eyes on Cho Chang who was still trying to deal with the loss of Ced. I lifted my eyes and found Fred's brown ones looking at me like a lion at its prey. His stare went from my face to my hips and Draco's leg. I let my instincts act for me, turning my body discreetly more to his direction, to give him a front view. As the blond boy was giving him the back, I kept my eyes on Fred and slowly uncrossed my legs and crossed them again, being aware I was using the uniform skirt. I noticed Fred's eyes going down there and him starting to breath more deeply, then up again to mine, narrowed, while clenching his jaw, pissed off. I knew damn well what I was doing. "Lilith!" I heard Hermione's voice calling me. "Can you help me with this potion, please?" I stood up from Draco's lap and went straight to the Gryffindor table, looking confident and calmed. I approached the Granger girl, who was just two seats away from Fred. Ignore him, Lilith, ignore him. Hermione always followed the rules her book gave her but sometimes struggled with creativity so I corrected her potion suggesting to change some herbs for other ones that would work better.  "Thanks, Lilith. You are really good at Potions." she complimented, smiling, looking proud at the result in front of her. "No problem, 'Mione." I caressed her shoulder. "Obviously she is, 've you forgot who her uncle is?" Ron Weasley interrupted, looking like if he wasn't conscient about what he just said. "Ron!" Hermione called him out, snorting.  "Lilith, I'm going back to the common room, " I heard Draco's voice behind me, he was giving a deadly stare at the golden trio, who didn't seem too friendly to him neither. "Wanna come?" I felt Fred's eyes on me again, static and piercing, watching every single movement and word of mine. Trying to swallow hard discreetly and feeling the nervousness installing in my stomach, I looked straight to Draco. "Nah, I have to send a letter, will catch you up later in the common room, though." "Fine, see you later then," he replied, messing my hair with his hand as a sign of affection. I waited for him to leave the place to look back at Fred, whose eyes followed Draco's way, looking colder than ever and then, returned to me. I thought he would seem bothered or annoyed but a little smirk formed on his face and I felt the fire grow inside of me. "Hermione, I gotta go," I said still staring at him while giving the girl a little and quick kiss in her hair. "See you later, Georgie. The rest of you, bye." I started walking away, putting the new book in my bag, trying to control my breathing even though Fred's intensity burnt me and made every single nerve in my body activate. While I was about to change my direction to the place where the owls were kept to handle Iris a note for Remus and Tonks, I felt someone dragging me to an empty and narrow corridor. "What do you think you are doing, Arambella?" I felt his hissing voice really close to my lips, as he lifted my chin to make my eyes meet his. His voice sounded soft and calm but sharp and threatening at the same time. Fuck. His hips were glued to mine and my chest collided with his every time I breathed. "Excuse me?" Fred raised his eyebrows with that little smirk on his face and his brown eyes way darker. The back of his right-hand fingers caressed my cheek slowly going down until he gripped my neck, already sending butterflies to my stomach and tingles to my lower belly. His other hand placed in between my knees and started to crawl up in a slow and torturing way until it was trapped in between my thighs but still not where I wanted it. "Are you trying to make me jealous with Malfoy, Lilith?" he whispered, pretending to sound amused. "Because it's not going to work, darling." I looked at the hunger in his eyes, felt the heaviness in his breathing and the rasp in his voice and then, I smiled devilishly. Oh, Freddie, it was definitely working.

"I'm not trying to make you jealous," I replied, acting innocently. "I was just helping my friend." "Mmh, so you want me to believe you weren't provoking me?" he said, very close to my face, letting his thumb play with my lower lip and making his other hand go up until it almost reached my underwear. I opened my legs more, Fred smiled.  "What if I did it, Freddie? What are you going to do?" I teased him and then keeping eye contact with him, slowly touched his thumb with the tip of my tongue, watching him breathe deeply. His eyes met mine and devilishly smirked.  The next thing I felt was how he dragged me to the closest door which belonged to an empty classroom. He quickly cast a locking spell to the door, with me still glued to his body. Slowly and patiently, Fred separated from me and with his fierce and piercing stare, put his hands in the pockets of his trousers. "On the desk. Now," he said with a dominant but soft voice.  The butterflies inside my stomach formed a hurricane and with my heartbeats already concentrating down there, I walked backwards to the empty teacher's desk and sat there leaving my legs a little bit opened. With my hands on my knees, I looked at him raising an eyebrow. Fred approached slowly and when he got close enough, he took a hand from his pocket and caressed my cheek softly, going down my neck, my breasts to pass to my thighs. His other hand quickly passed around my hips to make me closer to him, making me open my legs more to give him more space. His fingers stopped right before touching me over my underwear. "Do you want me to touch you, Lilith?" I smiled and passed my hand slowly to his neck, pressing a little bit, and dragging his face closer to mine. He was trying to show himself unaffected by me, but I could already feel the warmth coming from his body, his erratic breathing and his trousers becoming tighter. I pressed my lips against his in a lazy and painfully slow kiss in which both of us were trying to claim control, I gave up when he bit my lower lip and a soft moan escaped from my mouth. "Yes, Freddie, touch me," I murmured against the skin of his neck, giving him goosebumps. Instantly, I felt his thumb rubbing my clit over the underwear in unhurried circles, making me gasp. His other hand caressed my thigh, squeezing a little bit, going up until it reached my underwear and took it out. He made me spread my legs more, and softly pushed my body against the desk so I had my back touching the dusty wood, still with clothes on but completely exposed. His touch, now deeper, became almost electric and I couldn't help but moan louder. My hands got to hold onto the desk edge when I felt two of his long fingers entering inside of me, I raised my eyes and found him admiring my body, biting his lower lip while smiling. Fred lowered himself to me and started kissing and sucking my neck while his fingers kept coming in and out of me as his thumb was still playing with my clit. This boy was going to end me. "Do you want me to fuck you, darling?" he whispered in my ear.  "Yes." I managed to mouth without stuttering, closing my eyes to enjoy him more. "Beg me, Lilith," he replied, kissing my neck and making his fingers go deeper. "I d-don't beg."  "Oh, so that's how we are playing?" he chuckled with his raspy voice, sending me shivers. Fred removed his fingers from inside of me and I was about to complain when he literally went on his knees, with his eyes fixed on mine and his hands grabbing my thighs to spread my legs even more and leave me exposed in front of him. "I'm going to make you beg, Lilith, and I'm going to show you I'm the only one who can make you this wet." His lips kissed my inner thigh, slowly and torturously going down. He stopped himself right before getting where I wanted him. Feeling his breath against me made my breathing go more erratic and clumsy, every single nerve in my body was craving him. I gasped when I felt Fred's tongue going from my entrance to my clit, his eyes were focused on mine for a moment, with fierceness and thirst shining in them. His lips went deeper on me with his tongue playing with my clit making me moan louder than I wanted and taking my hands to his hair.  "You taste so fucking delicious." He ran his tongue on my entrance, taking all my wetness and drinking of me like a thirsty animal.  "Fuck, Fred!" I groaned trying to close my legs but he managed to hold me steady. His hands went inside my shirt and my bra to caress my breasts, feeling his warm hands against my skin I tilted my head back, trying to fill my lungs of air while his tongue went in and out and his lips were still on me. "Ready to beg, Lilith?" he smiled, with his deep voice, against me, feeling his breath.  "Mmh, in y-your dreams maybe," I murmured, trying to move my hips but his hands grabbed them, holding them against him and the table, firmly. He snickered and continued eating me out. I was already feeling a huge bonfire forming in my guts while my sight went a bit blurry.  A loud and hoarse moan escaped from my lips when Fred introduced two of his fingers inside of me while his tongue went back to play with my clit. The sensations were multiplied and I felt my legs trembling, while he smiled against me. The heat in the room involved us as his mouth was completely wet by me and his movements got deeper, eating me out as if I was his last meal on this life. I felt my heart racing and hitting my chest. I couldn't take it anymore, I needed him. "Freddie, please!" I cried out.  "Please what, darling?" he asked, taking his fingers off me and then giving a lazy lick to my clit, making me writhe in his grip. "Fuck me." "That's what I thought."  The proud smile covered his face and he raised himself. With his piercing and wild brown eyes on me and the afternoon light covering us, he looked at me arrogantly, his head kinda raised and a smirk, taking off his belt. I was so desperate to feel him again that the time he spent putting a little bit down his trousers and boxers, leaving his hard dick free and the veins in his hips more marked than ever, felt like an eternity.  "I'm going to make you forget Malfoy's name," he said, still arrogantly smiling, grabbing my hips tightly. Digging his fingers in my skin, Fred pushed himself inside of me in just one hard thrust. I moaned louder, feeling him stretch and fill me. He sighed and closed his eyes. "So fucking good..." "Freddie..." I cried out trying to move my hips closer to feel him deeper. He seemed to know my intentions because still grabbing my hips, he started to move faster and deeper while letting out soft and raspy moans. His hips crashed into mine while, with just one hand, he aggressively opened some buttons of my shirt, showing the start of my breasts. He lowered himself, still pushing hard making the tension in my hips a mixture of pain and pleasure that dried my mouth, to kiss my exposed skin, leaving a path of red love bites behind him.  "You are driving me crazy - fuck!" he whispered against my mouth, panting, drowning the sounds against my lips while his movements inside of me became faster and rougher. The goosebumps covered me and I could feel my mind going blank, I was only able to sense him and the pleasure he was making me reach. "You love it when I fuck you, don't you? I nodded because it felt impossible for me to form a single word, the sound of his hips crashing against mine, his hand around my neck and the feeling of his tip already hitting my weakest spot was driving me right to the limit. The wetness in between my legs grew and I felt myself tightening and clenching around him, I thought he would help me to finish but with a mischievous and devilish smile, he slowed his movements. I whimpered complaining, taking my hands from his neck and hair to his back to hold him closer. "Wanna cum, darling?" he asked playfully while taking his thumb back to my overstimulated clit and doing soft and slow circles in it while he remained still. I was so fucking close that it almost hurt. "Yes!" I complained, with a hoarse and exhausted voice while moving my hips to try to feel him again, but his hands when straight to them to hold me.  "You are mine, Lilith, and mine alone, do you understand?" he whispered, kissing my sensitive neck and jaw. "My perfect little whore."  His words turned me on so much that a soft moan left my mouth and he slammed his lips against mine, making me clumsily continue his messy kiss while silently begging for him to keep fucking me. "Say it, Lilith." "I'm mine, Freddie, but I'll be yours every time you fuck me," I whispered catching his face in my hands to then bit his lower lip, making him smile and groan. Even though I thought his words were the product of the desire and his dominant role during sex, I couldn't help but feel tingles in my stomach. "Good girl." his hands went to my thighs to make me surround his hips and without hesitation, Fred started to thrust again, even harder than before while his eyes pierced me. I felt him in every inch of me, while his breathing was heavy and his moans louder. I clenched around him and he groaned digging his fingers in my thighs making me pant. I was so close to my limit again, feeling already the fire burning me. Fred groaned against my lips, making me reach my orgasm. My eyes closed harshly and I gasped feeling the electricity covering me from up to down as my heart was going up and down in a rollercoaster. Fuck, it felt too good to be real. "Fred!" I gasped, scratching his back over his clothes. He started to push harder and fastly, moaning deeply and hoarsely at the same time that he came inside of me, tilting his head back and letting me leave kisses on his exposed neck.  We caught air at the same time, with him still inside of me, and our bright eyes encountering. "Wow." we both said at the same time right before bursting into laughter. That was bloody good. ✵ ✵ ✵ "Lilith!" Liv called me, right after I left my common room, trying to ignore the pain and the trembling of my legs. They had the whole night to recover but it seemed it wasn't enough. "Where were you yesterday? I was looking for you to prepare our bags for today's trip to Hogsmeade, don't you remember?" "I was a bit busy." I simply said, clearing my throat, with a mysterious smile. She frowned her eyebrows but then when her eyes went to my neck, she went back to my eyes and smiled. "Oh, really? Were you busy with Weasley?" "What?" I took my hands to my neck, early in the morning while I was showering I saw the love bites in my chest and the little bruises in my legs and hips but Fred probably left the skin of my neck marked as well. Fuck. I chuckled. "Well, I can't hide it from you. Are the marks too obvious?"  "I wish I could tell you otherwise, but they are, mate, are you fucking a boy or a vampire?" "Liv!" I complained, chuckling. "I'm sorry but it's true! You can hide it if you put on your scarf, it's a bit chilly out there so it won't be weird."  At the exact moment I took the Slytherin scarf from my bag, the twins appeared in the corridor, followed by a bunch of Gryffindors from their course, so I quickly put the clothing around my neck, watching Olivia struggling to hold back her laughter. Fred's eyes and mine met for a brief moment and he raised his eyebrows when he saw the scarf. His mind probably connected the dots because a proud and little smile appeared on his face and he winked at me while walking away, discreetly lowering his Gryffindor scarf to show me he was also covered in the love bites I gave him. "Lilith! Are you two fucking or trying to kill each other? Look at the poor boy's neck!" Liv whispered, snickering surprised.  "I dunno," I replied innocently, "Maybe both." "Merlin!" she laughed while tangling her arm with mine and starting to walk. "Let's go before someone else sees the marks, or worse, you two start fucking again." With the stinging in between my legs and the memory of his touch, we walked out of Hogwarts, my eyes fixed on his back and a silly smile on my face.   

Once we got into the little village, we all separated into our respective friend groups. Liv and I, of course, stuck together while I saw how Fred, George and Lee Jordan almost flew to Zonko's, I tried to hold my smile trying to imagine all the possible jokes and funny stuff they were planning."How has been the Quidditch training?" Liv asked while we walked on our way to the Three Broomsticks."Quite well, except for the first one I missed because of Umbridge, the rest have been very good, the new kids have talent," I replied looking at the fallen leaves on the floor. "Any news from Pauline?""We keep writing to each other. It's tough to be away from her, especially when my feelings keep growing but we're doing fine. Maybe I can see her these holidays." she smiled, with her blue eyes shining happily.We passed by a group of different stands that called the students' attention. One of them, a little stand that was selling muggle stuffed toys - apparently it was trendy in the Wizarding world to imitate the muggle festivals - called Liv's attention, grabbing my hand and dragging me with her. As soon as we got in front of it, some other students joined."Morning, lassies," the young man greeted us two since we were the first ones to arrive. "Would you like to try to get one of the stuffed toys? If you hit in the bullseye, it'd be free, but you've got to do it the Muggle way.""Lilith, you have a good aim, can you get me one of those which looks like carrots?" she said, making a little pout. I rolled my eyes but smiled."Didn't know you fancy Fred Weasley, Liv." I teased her."The pot calling the kettle back!" she complained, laughing. "I'm not the one having sex with him.""Touché."I took the three darts in my hands while focusing on the bullseye. Modestly, thanks to Quidditch, I had a trained sight and very good aim, so it took me just a couple of seconds to focus and to hit the centre in just one throw. Liv clapped by my side and the rest looked quite surprised but also smiled. The boy handed Liv her stuffed toy, slightly shocked."That was good luck, lass. Well done!"I hugged the blonde and then, felt someone touching my arm. Granger was behind us, trying to stay with her firm and relaxed expression but with a particular bright in her eyes."Lilith, can I talk to you two for a second?" she asked, trying to take us a bit far from the crowd. We both nodded."What is it, Hermione?"She took a deep breath, "Ron, Harry and I are planning something," she stated playing with her hands but still, sounding confident. "You already know Umbridge is preparing us so poorly to whatever is happening out there, so we decided that since Harry is so well-trained in DADA, he could train us as well. I was wondering if you two would like to join us later at the Hog's Head to chat about it."We both looked at her a bit shocked. I definitely was hating Umbridge's classes and because of the lack of practice, I was losing all the abilities I got thanks to Lupin during summer."Count me in." I quickly said, watching her face lightning with a huge smile."Yes, me too. I need to improve in DADA, is Luna joining?""Yeah, I think so," Hermione said, still excited. "Thank you so much, girls."✵ ✵ ✵The Hog's Head wasn't exactly the type of place where people like us would enter for a pint. Lugubrious, dark, dirty and with a strong smell in the air. I tangled my arm around Liv's when I noticed how she swallowed hard, even the worst of the muggle clubs we used to attend was better than that place."You know," Liv started as we approximated to the table where Hermione and who seemed to be Ronald and Potter were waiting for us. "I haven't told you yet but I'm proud of you for wanting to fight the Death Eaters and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.""I'm really proud of you too, Liv. You're incredibly brave.""I hope now that you're showing how willing you are to fight for the right reason, all their group start respecting you more.""Maybe they do, but I'm not doing it to gain anyone's respect, I'm doing it to avenge myself and Ced."Liv agreed."Morning, lads." I greeted once we were in front of the kids. Hermione smiled at me while Potter and Weasley gave a little awkward nod. "Can we sit?""'Course, go on." the girl responded, taking her bag from the seat to let me be by her side, with Liv by mine.Before I could speak again, one of the waiters approached us with a non very pleased face."What do you want?" he growled."Five butterbeer."He put his hand under the counter and took out six dirty and dusty bottles which were put over the table with brusqueness."Ten sickles.""I'll pay," Harry spoke before the rest of us could, giving the waiter all the coins.The man examined the boy from up to down, focusing a little bit too much on his scar. I narrowed my eyes analysing his face while grabbing Potter by his sleeve and forcing him to sit down again."I bet we could order anything in 'ere," Ron whispered. " That man would serve us fire whiskey if we ask him"I chuckled looking at Hermione's shocking face."Ron! You are a Prefect now!""Oh, yes!" his smile faced away."You wouldn't like it." I intervened. "Not the first time, at least. Later you get used to it.""You have tried it?!" he asked genuinely surprised."Of course I have!""Blimey!""Apart from Lilith and Olivia Lovegood, who else did you invite, Hermione?" Potter asked, changing the topic."Just a couple of people" she replied, giving a quick look to the door. "They should be here already."As soon as she stopped speaking, the pub's door opened. A whole multitude appeared; Nev, the Patil sisters, a bunch of Gryff kids from Hermione's course, Cho Chang with a friend of hers, Luna -who looked as distracted as always-, Angelina, Katie, Alicia Spinnet, a bunch of Hufflepuffs, three boys from Ravenclaw with Ginny Weasley and closing the queue, the twins and Lee, with three big bags full of Zonko's stuffWow, that was just a couple of people?Luna smiled when she saw us and quickly ran to sit by her sister's side, who took her hand and started caressing it. I greeted her with a smile and a little wink that she replied."A couple of people?" Harry spoke with a broken voice, "A couple of people!""The idea was successful! Ron, go get more chairs."The waiter who was cleaning some glasses that looked like they never were cleaned before, opened his eyes widely. Probably, it was the first time his pub was this crowded."Oi!" Fred greeted us when he got first to the table, putting his eyes on me, surprised, for a second. He started to count his company. "Can we have.... twenty-five butterbeer, please?"The poor man looked at the ginger as if he wanted to kill him. Soon, we all had our drinks with us and were carefully looking at Potter. The poor boy seemed to want to hide below the table as his eyes were fixed on Cho.Do I smell romance?"What are you doing here, Lilith?" Fred whispered discreetly in my ear, squatting down, between me and Olivia. "Do you miss me so much?"I snorted. "You wish me to." I took a long sip of my bottle. "Hermione told Olivia and me to come, she mentioned something about Potter training us in DADA.""Oh, so you don't have enough with me beating you in the Quidditch training that now you want me to beat you in DADA as well?" he teased me. I gave him a challenging look while smiling. Luckily, everyone was focused on their business so it was quite a private conversation."Don't provoke me, Weasley. Have you forgot what happened last time you played with me?" I asked him, making my voice get deeper and more seductive, hearing him breathe deeply as the memories of our encounter in his Gryffindor room came back to his mind. Fred tried to dissimulate a mischievous smile."Believe me, darling, I haven't.""Mmh, you shouldn't forget about covering your neck either, I can see the marks on your skin.""Well, someone played a bit hard yesterday," he winked proudly, taking his hand to his neck and giving a soft caress to then, cover the lovebites I gave him."You are not the one with the bruises in legs and hips and the neck entire covered in marks, are you?" I whispered, lowering my scarf a little bit, very discreetly, to show him his trail on my skin. Fred stared at it arrogantly and proud."Well..."Hermione started, full of nervousness, calling everyone's attention, making Fred go back to his seat next to his brother who greeted me, waving his hand and making me imitate him. "Uhmm...all of you know why we're here. Our friend Harry had the idea - well, I had an idea that would be convenient for people who want to study Defence Against the Dark Arts, and I mean really study it, not those stupid things Umbridge is making us read and copy." A bunch of people cheered her, and she got more confident. "I thought it would be good if we learn how to actually defend ourselves, not only in theory but in practice, and who better than Harry to teach us?""But I suppose you also want to pass the OWLs, right?" A Rave interrupted her. I looked at him and he was one of the boys who used to mess with Luna. How bloody ironic."Of course. But I also want to be properly trained in Defence because," she swallowed hard. "Because Lord Voldemort is back"I gasped loudly and caught Olivia's hand to press it in mine. Hearing his real name really gave me the worst chills and shivers ever. I never used it and it really scared me to hear it, especially since the curse that followed the only mention of his name was usually used by my mother in her time of freedom. Everyone else in the room seemed to be quite disturbed as well. He wasn't a pleasant person for any of us."Well, that's the plan. If you want to join us, we have to decide where..."I could hear how someone tried to argue with her and how Potter talked, but I wasn't listening at all. His name and my mother's voice casting it to make the Death Eaters appear was wandering in my mind with terrible memories of my earliest childhood that I wished I could erase and forget about."You good?" Liv whispered, still grabbing my hand.I nodded, and gave a long sip to my butterbeer, finishing it."I'm sorry, but I don't think talking about Cedric's death is the best right now," Olivia said aloud, participating in the conversation."Is it true that you can do a Patronus?" another girl interrupted.Everyone started to mumble between them and I looked at Potter genuinely interested."Yes.""A corporeal one?""Yes.""Blimey, Harry!" Lee cheered behind us, he seemed pretty impressed. "I didn't know it.""Mum made Ron promise he wouldn't say anything." Fred talked, making me instantly look back at him. "She said you already attract enough attention.""How did you learn to do that? That's advanced magic." I spoke for the first time.'She's Snape's niece' 'I don't know what she's doing here' 'We should be careful with her' were some of the whispers I got to hear, but I ignored them staring at Harry's green eyes."Professor Lupin taught me.""Is it a stag?" I asked him and his face went completely shocked."Y-yes, how did you know?"I smirked, Professor Lupin talked to me about a ' famous student of him who achieved to form a complete Patronus at the young age of thirteen ' when my German Sheppard Patronus wasn't getting the smoothest form. "Wild guess."He didn't believe me but let it be. People continued to name all of his glorious achievements and he tried to respond to them with modesty."Well, the next question is how often we would reunite. " Hermione spoke once she noticed everyone seemed to agree on something. "I think, at least, once a week...""Wait a moment." Angelina Johnson interrupted her. "This can't interfere with our Quidditch training.""In ours either," Cho added."Nor in the Hufflepuff's," Smith said."In the Slytherin's neither," I said gaining a bunch of bad looks. "Don't look at me like that, Johnson, I know you want me to destroy you on the field. We can celebrate my victory later in the night if you like." I winked at her and she smiled winking back at me."We will see about that, Arambella. Maybe you end up celebrating mine, I'll let you meet the Gryffindor rooms if you behave yourself."I snickered, already more relaxed. Angelina was one of the few Gryffs with good vibes, our whole rivalry remained only in the Quidditch field."I can't believe you are flirting with Angelina having Fred behind you!" Olivia whispered in my ear."And what about it? I'm not his." I gave a quick gaze to where the ginger's eyes met mine for a brief second with an amused smile.Luna mentioned something about one of her Lovegood creatures and a little discussion formed at the table."They don't exist, Neville. Don't worry." Hermione stated pretty obviously, trying to make Luna sound like an idiot."Hermione..." I warned her and she mouthed a little 'sorry'. I wouldn't allow her or anyone else to hurt Luna's feelings. She already had enough.We continued discussing more terms about the reunions and, without knowing yet where the training would take place, we decided that we should sign a paper to make sure no one snitched to Umbridge about the whole thing.Fred was the first one to confidently sign on the paper, being followed by his brother and other close friends of Harry. While some people were still doubting, I took the piece of paper and signed my name very clear; Lilith M. Arambella, and passed it to Liv and Luna."Well, time keeps going," Fred said, impatiently, starting to leave. "George, Lee and I have to buy some delicate stuff. See you later.""You wanna go with him?" Liv asked in a soft voice when she noticed how my eyes followed him."What? No, why would I?" I snorted, trying to keep looking at her and not at the door where the ginger left.✵ ✵ ✵Later on, already back in the castle, after some endurance training in my dorm, I went straight to the owlery where Iris waited for me, excited.I took a piece of paper from my bag and a pencil and started writing;Dear, Remus:

How's everything going? Umbridge's classes are awful! My patience is already fading away and we've only been here for a month! I miss you and our classes a lot and can't wait for Christmas to see you again. Since you were so gentle to give me Iris, I have for you a little present as well and saw something in a Hogsmeade shop that Tonks might like. How's Sirius doing by the way? Tell him I say hi. I send him a little bag of sweets too.

Lots of hugs. XX.

-Lilith.I fold the note and tied it to Iris' little leg as well as the new CD I bought for Tonks of her favourite magic band, the Weird Sisters, the chocolate bar with a little bracelet Liv taught me how to do on my own for Remus and the sweets for Sirius. Making the little owl fly away, I let myself rest, breathing the fresh air for a little moment.The first Quidditch matches were pretty close and I was craving them more than ever, I needed to feel the adrenaline and the cold air in my face again, and I had a lot of people to show I earned and deserved my place as a player. Wondering in my mind about strategies I could use and different forms of playing, everything that worried me in the depth of my mind disappeared for that brief moment, and for once, I felt like a normal teenager witch.

"Why does Johnson look so excited?" I asked Draco when I saw Angelina walking away, almost jumping with joy.The blond boy by my side snickered a bit pissed off. "McGonagall gave her filthy team the permission to participate in the Quidditch competition Umbridge took from them, with her new decree every club needs her permission first.""Wait, what? Has anyone in our team asked her for our team?!""If you weren't daydreaming all the time you would know the answer to that question, but don't worry, we do have her permission," he said pretty sure of himself. "Umbridge knows what she is doing."I looked at him, scowling. For some weird reason, Draco was becoming an absolute teacher's pet, especially Umbridge's, and distancing from me. Maybe I should have a little chat with him...Then, the dots connected in my mind. That bitch's new decree; not allowing student clubs unless she approves them, couldn't be a coincidence. Someone snitched."Draco, I gotta go, see you later." I stood quickly from the table and kissed the boy's cheek to ran out of the Hall. I needed to find Hermione as soon as possible."Don't forget to visit Snape's office!" I heard Draco shouting at me as I was leaving. "He wants to talk with you."Well, I wasn't exactly in a hurry to talk with him. We didn't exchange a word in his classes and I was doing my biggest effort not to do anything highlighting for him to address me, so if Severus really wanted to talk to me, he could wait.Luckily for me, I recognize the girl's fluffy and characteristic hair at the end of the corridor. "Hermione!"The Granger girl, as always, was accompanied by her two mates and, surprisingly, looked quite calm."Haven't you heard about Umbridge's new bullshit?" I questioned in a whisper once I got close enough to her. "How are we gonna have the training classes with Potter? And who the fuck told that bitch about this ?""Oh, don't worry, we will know soon who told Umbridge and, about your other question, someone gave us the perfect answer," she replied, still pretty calm.I stared at her, confused."Have you ever heard about the Room of Requirement, Lilith?" she smiled.✵ ✵ ✵"Is it here where we are going to practice?!" I almost shouted, amazed at all the high-quality equipment in the room. "How did I never heard of this place?""It only appears when you truly need it," Hermione responded, guiding the rest of the lot.At the end of the group, I found Liv and Luna so I quickly dragged them by my side. The Golden Trio started to explain where we were, answering the questions and trying to determine every detail, while I analysed everyone in the room. All red, blue and yellow ties."Am I the only Slytherin in here?!" I whispered to Liv, who couldn't help but laugh."Are you surprised? Lately, most of the Slytherins seem to agree with Umbridge and I doubt that any of the people here took the time to meet the other lot of your house who aren't problematic.""Fair enough, sometimes I forget who we are talking about.""Everyone agrees with the name Dumbledore's Army?" I heard Hermione asking with an authoritarian tone.Don't tell me they want to name this Dumbledore's Army... They've got to be joking.Hermione wrote it down on the paper where we signed.They were not joking, great."Very well," Harry started, making us focus on him. "Should we start practice? I thought the first thing we should practice is the Expelliarmus, I mean, the disarming chant. I know it's pretty elemental but I found it very useful...""Wait a moment!" I interrupted him, making everyone turn around to look at me, gaining some snubbing stares. "We know we are trying to learn DADA here because we want to fight the Death Eaters, but you don't beat someone by using only their same tricks, especially when they are absolute experts in those tricks.""What do you mean?" Harry questioned, pretty interested."The Death Eaters are experts in dark arts, I know it first hand, and it doesn't matter how much we practice, it requires Auror level of magic to fight some of them, at least following their combat style. What I mean is, why don't we combine Defence Against the Dark Arts with another kind of combat they are not trained in?"Everyone looked confused, but it was Hermione the one who formulated the question;"Do you mean using other ma-?""I mean learning muggle combat." I interrupted her. I could see how some people laughed at the idea and how others were genuinely considering it."How is that useful?" Ronald Weasley asked."Imagine a Death Eaters pulls an Expelliarmus on you before you get to attack them. You have three seconds to respond before they throw you an unforgivable curse because it's obvious that you won't have time enough to grab your wand back, so why don't we learn to hit them in those three seconds instead of just assuming we are already dead?"Some people held their gasp and kept wondering the idea in their minds."Lilith is right," Luna talked, walking by my side. "If we open our mind to other combat techniques, we have more possibilities than in a narrow field of fighting.""If Lovegood agrees with it, it is not a good idea." a Hufflepuff boy from her course."Luna is way intelligent than you, Smith. Perhaps you should keep your mouth shut." Liv replied, with her sweet tone, but firmly."Okay, that's a very good idea, Lilith. But who's gonna train us in that?"I looked at Liv and she smiled at me, accomplice."I can do it," I replied crossing my arms. "You take the magic training, Harry, and I do the muggle one.""Don't take me wrong, but what do you know about it?""I learnt it to show Snape I did mean my threat of abandoning Hogwarts if he didn't let me enter in the Slytherin Quidditch team. He said that women weren't allowed on the team and I told him if he wanted me to be a rude bad boy, I'd quit Hogwarts, learn muggle combat and join a gang. He didn't believe me at first so I proved myself right to him."I could hear Liv chuckling behind me and George and Fred snorted at the same time, trying to hold their laughs because of the shock."Why am I not surprised?" Luna simply said, with a little smile."Okay, then," Harry continued, still processing it. "Since today's the first day we will do a proper-magic training, next day we will start with Lilith's training and the rest of the days, would be half Lilith half me."I nodded, smiling, observing how the rest seemed to agree as well."Okay, let's start," Harry said, with a firm but soft tone. "Everyone in pairs, please.""Liv, you go with Lun and I go with Nev?" I asked the blonde by my side when I noticed how the poor Gryff boy seemed to be rejected by the others.My best friend agreed, smiling, and I walked towards Neville."Hey, Nev, do you have your partner?"He smiled at me with his shiny brown eyes but shook his head slowly."Can I be yours? I don't have one either and I've missed your company.""Oh, thank you, Lilith. And sure, but I have already to apologise, I'm not good at spells or casts,"I saw how some boys were laughing discreetly while looking at us, and I gave them the Slytherin-look; an eyebrow raised, jaw clenched and eyes full of arrogance. Exactly how the purebloods looked at the muggle-borns."There's nothing to apologise for, Nev. That's exactly why we are here, to learn. Don't be too hard on yourself for making mistakes."In less than ten seconds, the entire room got full of Expelliarmus and flying wands. Neville's particularly was one of the first ones to fall. He seemed pretty disappointed."It's okay," I murmured to him, "You are in Year 5, I'm in Year 7, give yourself a break. I know you can make it."He nodded not too sure of himself but we kept practising for a while. Since Neville was so frustrated, I analysed his movements and found what possibly was making him fail."Wait, let me try something," I said, putting my wand on the floor and walking to him. I moved his arm and his leg, making his posture more firm, noticing how he was blushing and I made him put his back straight so he seemed more convinced of his own movements. I went back to my place, with a defensive position."Harry, what do you think?" I asked Potter who was observing us, carefully."Yeah, that's much better," he said, giving me a gentle smile."Try now, Nev""Expelliarmus!" Neville mouthed more firmly and my wand flew out of my hand.Everyone stayed silent, observing the Longbottom kid, surprised.I looked at him, excited and ran to hug him. "Nev, you did it!""I did it," he repeated, processing it and corresponding to my affection.After a long time practising, Harry called us. "Well, I think for today's enough. Would you all like to reunite again on Wednesday night?"We all agreed and started to disperse."I'm going to the owlery to send Lin a letter, see you later in my room?" Liv asked, being followed by Luna. I nodded, smiling at them, while I was putting my wand inside my bag.I still had something pending to do; talking to Draco. Especially because it seemed to be that I wasn't the only one who noticed how such a teacher's pet he was becoming and considering he was also a Prefect, he could get all of us in trouble."Harry, mate, we need to borrow something from you." I heard Fred's voice talking in a whisper. It had been a few days since our last encounter, and we barely exchange a word. I didn't like that, but I tried not to give it too much importance."What is it?" Potter asked."The Map."A map? Why would they want that? I saw how the twins waited till they got out of the room to open it and I couldn't help but feel a lot of curiosity. These last weeks since we arrived at Hogwarts, I always saw the two of them planning a lot of stuff but never actually doing it unlike in previous years, what were they planning? Without letting my mind think twice, I followed them, carefully, trying to look as if I was simply going back to my common room.Hearing them whispering between each other, I noticed how they turned to the other corridor and when I was about to imitate them, I felt someone touching my shoulder."What are you doing?" Draco called my attention.Improvise, Lilith."I was going to the common room." that wasn't exactly a lie. "What about you?""Some Prefect duty. Wanna go to the Hall to grab dinner?""Nah, I don't fancy it right now, thanks, but it's good I found you 'cause I wanted to talk to you.""About what?" he asked, already defensive."About how you're becoming an absolute Umbridge defender for no reason and especially, why are so distant from me? Did I do something wrong?"He scowled and sighed hard."It has nothing to do with you, I-" he seemed not to find the correct words."You what?" I encouraged him to speak."It's just that I feel you are no longer the Lilith I knew." he finally said, murmuring. "Now, you get along with Granger and Potter, as if your friendship with the Lovegoods weren't excentrical enough, and you are all the time daydreaming or smoking. I feel like you will not want to keep hanging out with me if those filthy Gryffindors start putting you against me because of what I do to them."Oh, Draco..."That's so wrong in so many ways." I started, trying to remain calm. "How many times I've told you I consider you my little brother? Do I daydream and smoke more? Yeah, I do, 'cause I'm mentally exhausted and one of my best friends died just a few months ago, of course, I'm not in my best moment. Do I get along with Hermione and Potter? I do with Hermione, I remind you I had to spend the entire summer with her, did you expect me not to try to make it bearable? And that thing about Liv, she has always treated you right, hasn't she?"He nodded, a bit embarrassed."You two are my closest friends, no matter what. I consider her my sister because certain topics are too much for a 15-year-old boy to help me with or to even listen, and because she has always been there since I met her, Draco. Whatever fight you had with Granger, Potter or whoever, it has always been your business 'cause if they don't defend me from the Gryffs then I'm not defending them, but maybe you should try to keep the claws down for a bit, you are almost a grown man and you don't need to follow your parents' path.""It's too easy for you. Your parents..." he opened his eyes widely, noticing what he was about to say.I bit my tongue."I know, whatever you were about to say, I do know it. But the same way I'm not Circe Snape, you don't have to be Lucius Malfoy."He played with his feet, looking at the ground, scowling and with his hands on the pockets of his robe."Come here, give me a hug," I told him, opening my arms. He seemed to doubt me at first but ended up coming to hug me tightly. "You'll always be my favourite pain in the ass, Draco. And me telling you off as a big sister doesn't mean I don't love you, it means I care about you, okay?"I noticed him nodding while swallowing hard."Now, off you go, grab me some chocolate and snacks, we can eat them together in the common room.""Where are you going?""To have a cig," I responded, walking away."Ugh, Lilith! Umbridge told you-""Umbridge can fuck off!"I left him in that corridor, probably shaking his head, and walked in the same direction the twins disappeared. When I was about to enter one of the Gardens, I felt a noise behind me."George, be careful!" Fred whispered, hitting his brother."If you hadn't given me the heaviest bag I would be more careful." the other boy complained.They were in front of me but seemed not to see me because of the dim moonlight. They were dragging bags from Honeydunkes."What are you two doing?" I hissed, amused, knowing that I'd scare them.The two of them turned around, gasping, and then snickered when they saw me."What are you doing in here?" George asked while Fred was giving me a quick up-to-down look."I asked first.""Just grabbing a little snack for our business.""You mean stealing candies from Honeydukes for whatever business you two are in?""Not stealing, we left two galleons in there," Fred said pretty proudly of himself. "But we needed this as soon as possible.""For what?""Haven't you heard? I thought the rumour got to the Slytherin room. Fred and I are planning to start our own prank objects business and we are in Hogwarts to make our first try.""Oh really?" I laughed."Let me guess, you think it's a stupid idea and we are throwing out futures away," Fred stated, rolling his eyes."No, I actually think it's a very good idea. Making a business from the only thing your two brains can function for? That's really cool and I bet you are going to smash it, Zonko's getting old.""Really?" the two of them said at the same time.I nodded. "But I do have a question. How did you get to Honeydukes?""Thanks to the Marauder's Map," George said, while Fred tried to stop him."George!""What? We can trust her!""What is that?" I questioned, making Fred take out of his pocket an old and empty piece of paper. "How is that special?""Wait, Lilith, let the little thing do his work.""I bet you've heard that sentence from Fred before, haven't you, Lilith?" George whispered in my ear, winking. I laughed, looking at Fred who seemed to be ignoring us while he said pointing with his wand to the piece of paper;"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."Suddenly, on the map started to appear some names and letters, including the title, The Marauder's Map."It shows every single place in Hogwarts," Fred said, showing me the cover."And other things we can't mention."I read the full names appearing on the paper."How did Remus let you have this?"They both looked at me, intrigued."Remus? What has Lupin to do with this?" Fred asked.I furrowed my eyebrows. Wasn't it obvious?"It says here: Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. Moony and Padfoot are Remus and Sirius.""Wait, what?" they talked at the same time, putting the map away, surprised."Yeah, haven't you heard them addressing each other like that at Grimmauld? They did it all the time.""Oh, Merlin!"We've met two of the Marauders!" George said, amazed."And one of them was our teacher!" Fred continued, imitating his brother's expression."But wait, who are Prongs are Wormtail then?""They were best friends with Harry's father, do you think maybe...?""Harry's dad? If he was like him, definitely not." George chuckled."Well, now that you have your little fun fact of the day, we have something to talk about.""Do we?" Fred said, raising one of his eyebrows, and trying to hide a smile."Yeah, and by 'we' I mean the three of us. I want an exchange.""An exchange for what?" George asked, confused while putting the bags closer to him."For not snitching," I said in an obvious tone. "I want the blueberry candies you might have.""Only that?" George said, looking a bit disappointed."Blueberry?" Fred asked in a whisper, at the same time, looking at me surprised as if it was the first time he saw me."Aha, in another situation I'd demand more, but since I want to see you ruining Umbridge's life and my uncle's, then I'm pleased with the candies."George handed me a little blue bag and I smiled at him."A pleasure doing business with you, gentlemen."He snorted, laughing, while his brother kept analysing me, confused and paler. Was he okay? Did I have something in my face?"Nice to see you, Lilith. We gotta go now, need to show Lee our new acquisitions.""Go on, Georgie, I'll catch you up later," Fred said, leaning against the wall."Oh, are you going to show her..?" George asked already walking away."Yes," Fred smiled, playfully."What are you gonna show me?" I asked confused when I didn't understand the twin telepathy.Fred smiled and grabbed my wrist, starting to walk to the tree where we shared a cig a few weeks ago. He sat on the branch and was about to help me to sit on it but I climbed on my own and got quickly by his side."I'm doing some business with someone and I got this from them." he lowered his voice, taking a green herb from his pocket, showing it to me."You want me to get high with you?" I laughed and then, I started taking a little of the herb to prepare the joint. It wasn't like I was going to reject his kindness..."Who else better than you and me?" Fred imitated my actions, while the autumn cold night air wrapped us and made us stick together.I gave the first puff, observing his attractive profile, how the moon illuminated his smooth skin, the bright of his ginger hair in the night and the mischievous sparkle on his eyes."Touché, Freddie."He snickered with his voice going deeper as soon as that nickname left my lips.

"Fine, can I get every one of you in a circle around me, please?" I started, making everyone in the Room of Requirement look at me. Today was my first day teaching the rest of the Dumbledore's Army how to truly fight.My eyes met a smiley Fred for a brief moment and I tried not to look distracted by him, after our encounter getting high a few days ago where we just laughed at the most insignificant things and flirted, we didn't see each other unless it was in the classes or at the Quidditch field.Everyone obeyed and formed a little circle around me, listening carefully, with comfortable clothes than the Hogwarts uniform. All the girls were wearing trousers, including me who borrowed them from Draco's wardrobe, to make our movements easier and precise."What I'm gonna teach you is a technique designed to be learnt in very little time and it doesn't matter who you are, your height, your weight or anything, just your precision."I heard some whistles of surprise and some giggles. They were probably thinking I was exaggerating or lying but they would see in a few seconds."Does anyone want a demonstration?""C'mon, Arambella. Show me what you have." A boy from Ravenclaw got in front of me, he was way taller and probably stronger than me, but before he could attack I already had him on the floor, with a foot on his chest, gaining everyone's gasp and shocked looks."How did you do that?" George asked amazed.I asked Liv to be my partner and started explaining the exact movements they had to do. After that, I told them to practice it carefully in pairs.While they tried to imitate the steps slowly, I was observing and analysing the possible mistakes, and almost everyone got it after a few tries, including Neville, who tore down Harry on his second try."You know, Lilith?" Fred called my attention while helping George to get up. "This might be the best idea your single brain cell had in a while. And it was quite funny how you sent to the ground that show-off in less than a minute.""We agree that we're some lucky bastards since you never used this on us before," George said, chuckling."Well, now that we know her technique is not like I wouldn't beat her anyway," Fred said, arrogantly."Oh, you are so sure of that, aren't you?" I smiled approaching him, making him smirk."Okay, this is my sign to go," George said in a whisper, grabbing his bag and going straight to Lee Jordan."You underestimate me, darling," Fred whispered very closer to my face."Mmh, next time we practice one of these techniques, I'll be your pair and let's see who beats who.""Deal," he winked at me, walking away to follow his twin.✵ ✵ ✵Almost two weeks went by and we got to practice only two days more in the Room of Requirement because of how busy we all were with the Quidditch training, especially now that the Slytherin versus Gryffindor match was only three days apart."Happy birthday, sister!" Liv threw herself to hug me tightly when I was about to sit on the Slytherin table to have lunch.I chuckled trying to keep balance and hugging her back. "Thank you so much!""I have a couple of presents for you, one from Pauline, one from Luna and two from me.""Oh Merlin, it wasn't necessary!""Of course it was, don't be silly! You don't turn 18 every day!"I sat back and Liv handed me the four gifts; Pauline's one was a beautiful silver ring with a snake carved in it and a little inscription on the inside that said; Amies pour Toujours. Always friends."Liv! This is so beautiful." I said with a trembling voice, I put it on my ring finger while I felt the tears forming in my eyes. Before, I used to get gifts from Severus, Liv, Draco and Lun and knowing that someone else had cared that much about me to give me something like this, melted my heart. "I'm gonna go later to the owlery to thank her properly."I opened Luna's gift; a hand-made necklace to protect myself from the Nargles."Ohh, my Lun!" I made a pout, wishing the girl was here to cuddle her."Now, here goes mine." She softened her voice and looked at me with shiny eyes. I couldn't help but smile at her as well. I opened the first one and it was a book, inside of it, I found all the photos we had together accompanied by little notes written by Liv. They were our happiest moments; the first we went to a Quidditch match together, the first time I travelled to her home, some muggle parties...at the end of the book, a single photo that made a little tear escape from my eyes; it was the two of us, sitting on the field full of flowers out of Liv's house, in Ireland, in the middle of the dusk, not looking at the camera because we were hugging each other while laughing.I look at Liv and wiping out the little tear, I hugged her as tight as I could. "I love you so much, Olivia.""I love you too," she kissed my cheek. Her other gift was a beautiful silver bracelet that inside had her name carved, she showed me her wrist and she was wearing another one that looked the same, but moved it a bit to show me it had my name in it."Lilith!" Draco chanted getting my side with a huge smile, the best mood I've seen him in since our last chat. "Happy birthday, here goes my present."I smiled at him and when I opened the package, I found a gorgeous sateen dark green dress."Draco! For fuck's sake, this is so beautiful!" I hugged him, almost jumping over him while he chuckled trying to keep me in my seat, and gaining some of the other people's gazes."You don't deserve less," he said in an aristocratic tone, caressing my back.After having lunch together, Liv and I went out to the corridor, where Hermione almost jumped at me, being followed by the twins and Neville, my eyes immediately focused on Fred."Happy birthday!" George and the Granger girl shouted together."Hang on, everybody knows today's my birthday?" I asked, quite puzzled, but being unable to erase the smile from my face."Liv told us," Hermione said while giving me a muggle novel I was desperate to get. I told her about it on one of our summer nights."Oh, Hermione, you remembered it!" I whispered while hugging her."Of course I did, we are friends!""I got you this plant, Lilith. I know it's not too much but..." Neville started, stuttering a little bit but I didn't let him finish his sentence because I cuddled him."It's more than enough, Nev. Thank you so much!""Our turn now," George said giving me a little bag, making me raise my eyebrows surprised. They were the last people in the world I expected to have a gift for me. "We have for you some of our best new articles to try; you can skip class with them, you can heal bruises, you can voluntarily faint and much more for you to use against the pricks you have in your house. We call it the Skiving Snackbox.""Oh, Georgie! This is fucking great!" I high-fived him, noticing how Fred was still staring at me.Selfishly, I wanted him to congratulate me and maybe even hug me, but he didn't and I wasn't going to ask him to."Lilith," I heard a severe voice from behind Liv, George and Hermione. I moved and got beside Liv, seeing Snape looking at me inexpressive. " A word, please."I wanted to protest but Liv put a hand on my back, silently telling me to go with my uncle. Waving at the four of them with a sad expression on my face, I followed Snape to his office. Once we got inside, he told me to sit down while he sat in front of me."I know our relationship has deteriorated widely, but, because after all, you keep being my relative and the last remainder of my family, I couldn't let your birthday pass without talking to you and giving you something.""You don't have to," I whispered."I want to, you are my niece," he said taking a little package from below his table. "And even though, I do not support your career choice because I think you can reach a better future, I have something for you.""Wanting to be the best Beater in the world isn't ambitious enough for you?""Open the present, Lilith, and shut up."I did so and gasped loudly when I saw the content; a Holyhead Harpies uniform."Severus...""I wrote to the team's captain and you have the tryouts in September. Make sure you train hard during the time left you have, if you want to be on the team, do your biggest effort to be the best one in it."I felt my heart racing and my breathing going erratic. The Holyhead Harpies...Caressing the fabric between my hands, I couldn't help but smile while trying not to cry of emotion. "Thank you so much, Severus, truly.""Now, go, I heard Malfoy saying you got some mail from Lupin," he complained. "Probably he wants to wish you a happy birthday."After he finished that sentence, I almost flew out of the office to the Hall where Liv was waiting for me, silently accompanied by Draco, who had Iris in his hands."Here you have."There was a howler, three packs and a letter. I opened first the Howler."HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LILITH! MATE, I HOPE I SEE YOU SOON AND WE CAN PROPERLY CELEBRATE YOUR EIGHTEENS WITH A GOOD PINT AND SOME CIGS. LOVE YOU LOTS LOTS LOTS!! AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT BLASTING NIRVANA IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE SNOBS" Tonks' voice filled the silence in the room, being followed by a bunch of murmurs, and making me snicker. Her gift was the last of Nirvana's cassettes, accompanied by a pack of cigs.Next, I opened the biggest of the packs; a big box of chocolates, sent by Sirius, under his Padfoot nickname, and then, I got to the other present and the letter.Dear, Lilith:

Happy birthday, kid! I can't believe you are already 18! Everything's fine here and I hope it is as well in Hogwarts. I send you the other gift I had for you knowing that your uncle probably gave you already his, Holyhead Harpies tryouts, huh? I'm so proud of you and I bet you're gonna smash it. Enjoy your day!

Lots of hugs.

-Remus. XXI kept the letter in my pocket to hang it later on my dorm's wall and looked at Remus'gift. This time I couldn't help but have two or three tears coming down my cheeks. It was a poster from the Harpies, signed by all the team."Oh, Merlin!" I heard Ginny shout excited from the Gryffindor table and standing up to run to mine. "Is this what I think it is? Bloody hell, Lilith, it's amazing!"After admiring how the team moved in the photo and their individual signatures, I grabbed my bag and the gifts I got during the whole day and walked to my common room, not without previously saying to Liv I'd wait for her in there. When I got to the entrance, I found Blaise leaning against it."Lilith, someone gave me this for you," he said, lazily, while handing me another package.One more? Who else knew about my birthday?I thanked him and took the pack along with the other gifts to my dorm. Sitting on my bed, I dispersed all the gifts to admire them on my own. It was the first time in my life I was surrounded by so much attention, considering that the only thing I ever got from my mother was my wand.I looked at the most recent present and saw a little note hanging from it, written with clumsy handwriting;You thought I would forget it? I'm not done with you.

Happy birthday, darling.

He remembered it. I pressed the note against my chest still surprised because Fred was definitely the last person on Earth I expected to give me something. If Lilith from a few years ago knew about this, she would have freaked out.His gift was a little bag full of blueberries I quickly opened, a black lingerie outfit of lace that looked pretty revealing and tempting and a vinyl record from Oasis, with Wonderwall highlighted. Where did he get the money for it? I don't know, but it was certainly the gift that excited me the most, even though I'm not too proud of admitting it.The happy feeling that wrapped me at that moment couldn't be compared with anything else world. I felt so loved and overwhelmed that this time, I let myself cry freely, treasuring the memory of this day on my mind.I guess everyone gets a little taste of happiness every once in a while.

Two days before the Gryffindor versus Slytherin match, after winning all the previous matches with some of the best scores we ever had, both teams were almost touching the Cup and the tension between the houses was bigger than ever. I saw how some Slytherins tried to curse people from the Gryffindor team even though I asked them not to because I wanted to show the Gryffs we could beat them playing fairly. Also, lots of them tried to curse me once in a while, but that wasn't new."Okay, today's training is gonna be quite fast 'cause I need to get ready for the day after tomorrow," I announced calling everyone's attention."Don't get too ready, Gryffindor is gonna win anyway." Harry teased, smiling at me."We'll see, Potter," I replied sure of myself, grinning."We are gonna beat you, Arambella," Angelina said in the back, accompanied by Katie Bell who passed her arm over the girl's shoulders."Except the Quidditch field, you can beat me wherever you want, Johnson," I winked at her making her laugh while positioning myself in the middle of the circle. "Okay, enough talking, we are going to practice one of the wrenches I taught you last time. Everyone in pairs, try to work with people you have strength or height difference with, keep in mind that most of the Death Eaters are adults."We all started to work and as soon as everyone practised it correctly, I approached Fred."Weasley, you and I have a pending fight."He snorted, laughing, "Oh, yes, you want me degrading you, fine, let's go."I heard some whistles of surprise and some giggles, apparently, everyone was watching."That's it, Weasley. Show her how Gryff is gonna fuck Slytherin!"Fred winked at me, pulling up his sleeves and adopting a defensive position."Destroy him, Lilith," Ginny cheered me, being followed by Hermione, Liv and Luna. I blew a kiss towards them and then got back to look at Fred.Harry gave us a sign and we quickly ran to each other, my legs surrounded his hips, throwing us to the floor, while I tried to trap his neck and hands with my arm, he writhed trying to put me under him. The wrench consisted of neutralizing our opponent's movements and keep them still on the ground for five seconds, it was a way to learn how to control our strength and to use it. He groaned when he felt my arm around his neck but quickly got away from it hitting my hip with his knee, taking advantage to make us roll in the ground and position on top of me but I went to his neck again trying to turn him around so, even though I was under him, I could trap him putting my arm around his neck and immobilizing his legs with mine. He seemed to catch my intentions because before letting me touch him he lifted my arms above my head and pinned them to the floor, ending in a quite sexual position. He seemed to notice it because he raised an eyebrow with that arrogant smile of him. I snorted, frustrated, still moving and trying to free my legs and to ignore how our bodies were touching and how our fighting was quite turning me on."Oi, Weasley, be careful! I was joking about the Gryffindor fucking the snake!""Nah, Lilith and Fred hooking up? That's not happening," Hermione laughed, pretty convinced, taking a hand to her mouth after she realised how she said 'hooking'. The poor girl wasn't used to sexual references.I imitated Fred's previous attack and took my knee to his hip, gaining a complaining sound from him, trying to be on top. When he saw I was about to win him, he quickly recovered and trapped me just exactly how I wanted to catch him, his legs surrounded my hips, with his ankles on my legs making the movement impossible, my back leaning against his chest and his arm pressing my neck."Who's gonna tell her how I fuck you, darling?" Fred whispered in my ear, playfully. I could even feel his cocky smile behind me. It took me so much by surprise that I stopped fighting back, and when I realised it was already the last second left. I clicked my tongue, frustrated."Get off me, you cheater!" I shouted, freeing myself from his grip and standing up in less than two seconds. He leaned up to sit on the floor while looking at me with a huge smile on his face. "You distracted me, bloody bastard!""Oh, did I?" he said playfully and mischievously."Yes! And that's against the fucking rules!""Nah, all is fair in love and war.""Oh, that's how we're playing?" I threatened him, and he winked at me."Definitely."I nodded, pretty pissed off. He was right, playing fair wasn't something I was up to do when fighting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and his followers but I couldn't help but feel frustrated and fucking stupid for having Weasley winning me, especially when I was so nervous for the match."Class is over, everyone!" Harry said, noticing how late it was. "We need to rest as much as possible."Everyone broke the circle they were doing around Fred and me and started picking up their stuff and leaving. I kept staring at how he got up and grabbed his bag while talking to George, I already felt the rage running through my veins."Let me guess," Liv started behind me, amused. "You're going to take revenge, aren't you?""Of fucking course I am, no one beats me like that, especially if it's Weasley." I hissed, still observing how he left the room on his own while George stayed chatting with Jordan."Go on, then!" Liv spurred on me, giving me a soft smack on my bum. I didn't wait anymore, simply grabbed my bag and followed the ginger's path.I found him in one of the boys' loos in the empty corridors, in front of the sink, taking some water to his face to refresh himself. I smirked, and entered silently, making sure to cast a Colloportus so the door was locked.He looked at me through the kinda broken mirror, unsurprised and raising his head arrogantly. For being a Gryffindor, he could genuinely copy Slytherin's aristocratic and conceited look."What do you want, Lilith?"I walked in his direction slowly, looking at him through the mirror as well, making sure the eye contact didn't break and trying to look unbothered even though I could feel the anger in my guts and the hunger to fuck him until he couldn't breathe hitting me hard."I'm taking revenge on you for cheating in my own game," I simply said, making him turn around, with an eyebrow raised, still smiling."Can't the Slytherin accept that Gryffindor won this one, as we will do in two days?"I chuckled with disdain, "You wish, Freddie."In the exact moment the nickname abandoned my lips, he took a deep and slow breath and kinda tensed. I got closer to him making our noses graze."Did you got my present?" he whispered while I let my hands travel down his body."I did.""And you liked it?"I nodded, unbuttoning his pants, feeling him already hard."I'm not done with you, darling. The last present is getting ready," he smirked and tried to kiss me but I quickly and brusquely moved my face and he snickered. "Uhh, someone's pissed off..."Without erasing the smirk in my face and staring at his shiny and bright brown eyes, I slid my hand inside his boxer and caressed him, gaining a deep and raspy moan abandoning his lips."Fuck, Lilith..." he managed to say, with a voice as deep as his moans, tilting his head back to leave his neck exposed. "I can't wait to see you in that lingerie..."I chuckled, making my voice more seductive and getting closer to him, stroking him a bit faster, making him groan again, covering his neck with kisses and love marks."I bet you want me to wear it while I ride you, don't you, Freddie?" I whispered in his ear, getting back to his neck and making sure my hand was pleasing him.He nodded, looking at me biting his lower lip. I rubbed my nose with his, and let my knees fall in front of him. Being like this made me notice he was bigger than I expected, but my plan was going to continue. I slowly kissed the skin in his hips and right below his belly button, leaving big and pretty noticeable love bites in his v line, knowing exactly what kind of touch he was silently craving from me. Looking straight to his surprised eyes, I passed my tongue through his tip, making Fred gasp and moan louder."Darling, if every revenge of yours is going to be like this, I'll have to cheat more often."I ran my tongue all over his dick, to then fit inside of my mouth as much as I could and stroke with my hand the part that was left. He seemed to definitely like it, because when I raised my eyes back to him, making the movement of my tongue and lips around him faster, he had his lips opened, moaning and panting, with his eyes closed. He tried to take his hand to my hair but I slapped it, gaining the sexiest chuckle I heard in my life. Damn, I would lie if I say I wasn't wet.Fred grabbed the edge of the sink, making his knuckles go completely white and moving his hips slowly to the rhythm of my mouth. I licked again from up to down, focusing especially on his sensitive tip, making eye contact with him, whose eyes struggled to keep open. I put it again inside my mouth and let him stare at how it got in and out, making sure it was fully lubricated. A single tainted tear because of my black mascara went down my cheek since I was trying to take as much from his size as I could. He smirked, letting a deep breath out and caressing my cheek. When I fastened my movements, he tilted his head back again, closing his eyes hard and moaning raspily and deeply."Fuck!- " Fred stuttered, struggling to catch the air as his orgasm was approaching. That's exactly when I took my mouth and my hand off him, standing up. He looked at me confused, with his tip redder because of the unfreed tension, and with the moans drowning in his throat. "What's wrong?" he asked murmuring since he was trying to catch his breath again."This is my revenge, darling," I announced him, separating, even though my most uncivilized part wanted to keep going and have him coming in my mouth while moaning my name."Oh, come on, Lilith. Don't play with me, I haven't finished," Fred complained, uncomfortable because of how close to his orgasm he was and letting a muffled whimper."Better think before you cheat," I said running to the door and grabbing my wand back. Casting an opening spell before he could complain again, I left him there, snickering incredulous.I run my thumb and my index fingers to the corners of my mouth to clean them and wiped out the black tear from my cheek. Then, I walked straight to the Hall with a proud smile."Well, how did it went?" Liv asked once I got by her side. Thanks to Draco being a Prefect, I took a little advantage of being one of his best friends and convinced him to let Liv share dinner with us at the Slytherin table. It wasn't like any of the other professors, except Umbridge, would care..."I bet he's having a hard time," I simply said, proudly. At that exact moment, Fred Weasley entered the Hall, with his hands on the pockets of his black trousers, making some people stare at him. He gave me a quick gaze, shaking his head smirking, and proceeded to sit next to his twin."What have you done to him, Lilith?" Liv asked, surprised."I sucked his dick without letting him cum," I proudly whispered, with my eyes on his back since we didn't have anyone in front of us.I felt Liv choking on the water she was drinking and trying not to laugh. "Oh, Merlin!" she said with a hoarse voice, still coughing, "Now, I'm prouder of you than ever."I high-fived her."Fred, mate," I heard George say with an amused voice. " I think you have a little problem in there," he pointed at his twin's trousers in a whisper, chuckling."You mean a big problem, Georgie?" Fred smiled, kinda frustrated, with his voice still a bit deep and putting his hands back to his pockets.The devilish part in my mind patted my back, proud of herself."Nah, it's smaller than mine. It definitely is a little problem," George replied, uninterested, taking a grape to his mouth.Liv and I had to take our hands to our mouths to hold our laughs.What great revenge.✵ ✵ ✵I was doing little jumps, trying to awake and relax every muscle in my body. The new Slytherin uniform suited me so well that my movements felt freer. The entire school was watching us prepare for what was about to happen in less than ten minutes.Today was the famous match.Lots of people were hyping up the Gryffindor team, but the Slytherin house was roaring and cheering more than ever, almost covering the other houses' shouts. Liv was sitting next to Blaise, giving me a wide smile with Luna by her side who had a lion mask on her head and a huge snake muppet on her legs. I observed the entire field; the Gryffs looked fiercer than ever, the grey sky that was perfect for our sights during the game accompanied by the cheers... it felt like being back at home; after all, there wasn't a better place in the world than a Quidditch field.Hotch ordered us to get in front of our opponents and as soon as I grabbed my broom, the Slytherin crowd shouted and roared of pure joy, clapping and chanting all of our names. Before we got out to the field, I could hear him singing a song against the youngest Weasley boy, now that he was Gryffindor's new Keeper since Wood graduated, even though I wasn't very fond of it. I wasn't the best player in the world either when I started and I used to receive a lot of mockery from Gryffindor back in the day. Even the current captain of my own team, Montague, tried to convince Marcus Flint to get me out of the team. Those chants only made us look as if we were afraid of them.Of course, I had to position in front of one of the Gryffindor Beaters, who couldn't be George, because my luck is never this good, but Fred. He looked at me with his characteristic arrogant smile, the fierceness in his eyes and taking deep breaths; he seemed like a lion looking at its prey but I wasn't going to flinch.I debated internally whether to leave my best training routines for my tryouts with the Harpies or to give my absolute best to beat Weasley and finally decided to do as much as it was in my hand.Hotch blew her whistle and the balls flew announcing the start of the match. With a last challenging smile, the fourteen of us threw ourselves to the air, ready to play.Let the game begin.

I threw my first bludger to Harry but he managed to avoid it. Johnson had the Quaffle and she passed through Montague and Crabbe, but another bludger made her lose the ball. Montague got the Quaffle and I got by his side beating back the shot George threw at him."There goes Arambella protecting Montague! That girl is the only good thing Slytherin has! What a woman!" I heard how Jordan commented, making McGonagall complain.I was about to keep out another bludger from George, but Draco flew too close to me, making Montague an ahead target. Katie Bell got the Quaffle and passed it to Spinnet, I was about to hit Alicia with a very good and clean shot, but I heard the Slytherin crowd chanting that song against Ronald again. For fuck sake, lot, not now. I failed the shot, grumbling.I defended some of the Chasers from Fred and soon, Warrington was about to score with that awful song still in the background.I didn't like it. I wanted to win Gryffindor with a fair game because I wanted to show them Slytherin didn't need to do this shit to be better than them."That bloody song is gonna distract him." George flew by my side, catching a bludger in his free hand."For the record, I don't have anything to do with it. I wanted a fair play.""I know," he simply said, giving me a gentle smile but pointing already to Warrington. While his bludger was flying, I almost threw myself to it, catching it and defending the Slytherin chaser who scored with a clean and precise shot. I was happy for my team because technically we weren't distracting the other players, but at the same time, it was a bittersweet flavour. I high-fived the boy as soon as he passed. When I saw Fred's intention to hit him, I got by the Slytherin's boy side and hit the ball back, allowing him to pass it to Pucey who scored again.A poor shot of Crabbe's bludger let Angelina score. I growled and while Pucey lost the Quaffle again in Angelina's hand, as soon as she passed it to Bell, I hit my bludger. The ball was Slytherin's possession again, I saw how Harry and Draco dropped down sharply."Fuck no!" I couldn't help but shout as soon as I saw how Potter got the damn Snitch and the Gryffindors started to howl. I'm gonna buy Draco a bloody pair of glasses, let's see now if the fucking twat can see a damn golden ball when he has it in front of his fucking eyes.A bludger hit Harry's back, and soon Hooch's whistle interrupted. We all got down to the fresh grass and I almost threw myself against the git of Crabbe."The fuck do you think you are doing?" I pushed him.The Gryffindor team were helping Harry to get up while Draco by my side, started to use his deadly mouth, of course:"You saved Weasley, didn't you, Potter? I've never seen a clumsiest Keeper. But well, he was born in a dumping site... Did you like my song's lyrics?""Draco!" I called him out, but the blond boy was too busy annoying the Weasleys."We wanted to add more lines but we didn't find anything that rhymed with fat and ugly," he snickered, "We wanted to sing to his mother as well."I pushed him, "Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are not going to body-shame anyone in my bloody presence!"He looked at me, annoyed. Who the fuck was this prick and what did he do to my Draco?"Don't listen to him, Fred," I heard Angelina saying, trying to control the ginger who seemed to be really up for breaking Malfoy's face. "He doesn't know how to lose.""But you do like the Weasleys, don't you, Potter?" Draco continued, throwing more shit against their economic situation.I pushed him again, this time harder, making him almost fall to the ground. "That's fucking enough, don't make me fight you, Draco. I'm warning you.""Since when do you defend them?" he whispered, angry."Since you are being this pathetic, messing with someone because of their social class or how they look. Are you so fucking childish, mate?""Maybe," he continued looking at Potter, "it's because you remember how your mother's house stank and the Weasleys' pigsty reminds you of it."I saw how Harry and George were running towards us, while Angelina, Katie and Alicia were trying to hold back Fred."I told you it was fucking enough, what you didn't understand?""Oh, shut up, Lilith," he said trying to hide behind me as George and Harry were running towards him. I moved aside."Oh, the fuck no, Malfoy. You said those words, now face the consequences. If I can't knock sense into you, maybe they can. All yours, boys."I stood aside, crossing my arms as I heard some people shouting the boys' names while they were beating the shit out of Draco. In another situation, I would have protected Draco or tried to calm them but he deserved it. Disrespecting Harry's dead mother like that and the whole Weasley family was enough for at least breaking his face. I even saw how Harry used one of the punches I taught him."Lilith, do something!""If I get in there, they are gonna hit me! He did it, now he deals with it!" I shouted at Pansy, who seemed to be so worried about Draco.Hooch's whistle sounded again as she was running to them, probably to separate them. Before she arrived, I sighed hard. I can't believe I'll have to do this."Okay, okay, that's enough. He's bleeding, you got your revenge." I said grabbing George's back while Hooch caught Harry. Draco was on the ground, moaning of pain and kinda crying, George had his lip broken and Harry had a cut under his eye and an eye a bit swollen. I could even hear how Fred was still struggling against the girls who were holding him back. Honestly, I can't blame him.While Hooch was telling off the Gryff boys I helped Draco to get up, and as soon as he caught his air back, I grabbed his ear and dragged him out of the field."Ouch, ouch, ouch, Lilith!" I heard him, complaining as we were arriving at the empty corridors, almost in the dungeons. I was so pissed off at him that I didn't even wait to get to the common room."What the fuck were you thinking about Draco?" I mumbled, separating from him while crossing my arms. He rubbed his ear and looked at me with puppy angry eyes."You let them hit me!""And don't you think you deserved it? You messed with Harry's dead mother, Draco! An innocent dead woman, for fuck's sake! What did you expect him to do? Kiss you and thank you?""I hate him," he complained, in a low whisper, still struggling to get air."It was a cheap shot, even for you. You can come for him with better things and yet, you decide to do that. You were lucky, if I were them I'd break your face and a good couple of bones."He didn't reply but I continued talking because I wanted to knock some reason in him and because I still cared about him."And the disrespect you showed to me telling me to shut up? Who do you think you are talking to? Have you forgotten who I am?""I'm a Malfoy, I can talk however I want.""And I'm an Arambella and if you ever dare to speak to me like that again, I'm not fighting you, Draco, I'm breaking any kind of connection or bond with you and this friendship would be over."His eyes watered, but he tried to keep stoic, "As if I cared about a half-blood's friendship.""This half-blood has treated you like her family, haven't I? Even better than my family. I have ignored how much of a prick you have been to everyone just because I love you and I consider you my little brother, I have worried for you and taken care of you. Do you really want me to stop doing it?"I noticed his expression faltering and he quickly wiped out the tears in his cheeks, with rage and frustration. Probably the anger was mixing with the pain."I don't," he whispered, with a trembly voice. My heart was breaking because after all, I did love Draco but I kept looking at him deadpan and severe. If his family didn't humble him, I was going to do it. "I'm really sorry, Lilith. I'm not going through my best.""Don't play that card with me, no one has a good life," I stated, "I told you thousands of times you don't have to be your father and you are witty enough to have a better response against your enemies than messing with their families or their economic situations, not all of us are so lucky to be from a rich family and to have daddy pleasing all our whims."He made a little pout and ran to me, hugging me tightly and letting himself cry on my shoulder. It was the first time I saw Draco crying and because of how much I still cared for him, I hugged him back, not as tight though, I was still angry."I don't want to lose you, Lilith," he stuttered, still with the tears in his eyes."You will not if you do as I tell you," I said, caressing his hair but with my voice in the same severe tone, "I'm not forgiving you this easy, though."I saw Liv walking pretty fast towards us in the corridor. "Lilith, Umbridge is looking for you, I think you are in trouble, mate," she said with a soft and worried voice.I scowled, separating from Draco."What? Why me? I was about to clean Draco's wounds if the cuts infect they might turn into scars,""I don't know but she looked really serious about it, you should go," she said, pretty convinced. "I can heal his wounds a little bit."I nodded and still in my Quidditch uniform, I started to walk away."I'm such a mess, aren't I, Olivia?" I heard Draco saying in a whisper while being taken to the common room by Liv. She was looking at him as if he was a five-year-old who got himself in trouble but did deserve the punishment he got."Yeah," she sighed in a soft tone, "You are."✵ ✵ ✵I knocked on the door and opened it, finding George and Harry sitting in front of Umbridge, who was with her typical fake smile, and Professor McGonagall, who was in a corner of the office looking annoyed at the pink-dressed bitch."You wanted to see me, Professor?""Yes, Ms Arambella, come in, please," she said with her repulsive high-pitched voice, pointing to a seat next to George, who was still with the most serious face I ever saw in his face. "Now that you are here, I can continue with the conversation.""They should be judged by me, Dolores." McGonagall interrupted, "And I don't know why you made Ms Arambella come, but if anything, as a Slytherin, she is Professor's Snape responsibility."Umbridge breathed slowly. While the two of them talked, my eyes covered the office again, it was incredibly ugly and naff."That's why...I see myself forced to suspend these students for life," looking at the three of us and calling my attention.Wait, what?!I felt my mouth opening widely, in pure shock."Suspend us?" Harry interrupted, surprised, "Do you mean we won't be able to play Quidditch again?"No, please, not that."That's right, Mr Potter, I think that will achieve the purpose of teaching you three a lesson," her smile became wider, "You, Ms Arambella and your friend Mr Weasley. And to make sure, his twin as well. If their teammates weren't holding him back, he would have attacked Mr Malfoy too."I was struggling to breathe."But what about Lilith?!" Harry said, confused, "She did nothing.""Ms Arambella was standing beside Mr Malfoy and did not stop the fight, she is as guilty as you are and my own eyes saw how she pushed Mr Malfoy more than once.""I can't believe you are doing this," George whispered, snickering incredulous and nervous. Full of anger."I will take your brooms away to make sure the punishment is fulfilled. But I'll be reasonable, Professor McGonagall," the addressed woman was standing behind us, looking like an ice statue, "I'll let both teams and the rest of their players keep participating in the matches."She let all of us go out. While I was in the corridor, I couldn't lift my eyes from my own feet. Suspended. No more Quidditch. I hate that bitch. I already felt the tears coming to my eyes but I wasn't going to allow myself to cry right there."Lilith!" I heard George's voice, "I'm really sorry about the punishment you got." He said walking by my side, putting his hands with the red knuckles because of the punches in the pockets of his trousers."There's nothing I can do about it," I replied, making sure my voice sounded calm."Yeah, but I know you love Quidditch and you did it to defend us."Silently, I shrugged."Slytherin lost its best player, to be honest. That bitch sabotaged her own house. You're almost as good Beater as me," he continued, changing his tone to a more joke-like one.I chuckled. "I'm still better than your brother.""That's for sure, but don't tell him I said that."Before I could notice, we were walking in the same direction so I ended up being in front of a lot of Gryffindors in the Garden."Suspended for life!" Angelina said, with a subdued voice. Apparently, Harry caught them up with it."And the worst part is that she suspended Lilith as well," Harry complained, sitting by Hermione's side.The whole Gryffindor lot looked at me surprised, and I especially felt Fred's eyes on me."She did not!" Ginny shouted, shocked."You did nothing," Angelina said.Hermione stood up and came by my side, passed an arm around my shoulders and caressed my arm."I'm really sorry."I shrugged again, crossing my arms and sighing hard. "She said it was because I pushed Draco and didn't stop Harry and George from attacking him.""That's not fair! Nor is suspending Fred! None of you two did anything!" Spinnet complained, hitting her knee with her fist."I haven't done anything because you didn't let me," he replied, with his eyes still on me, and looking fierce and annoyed. Not by me, but by the whole situation."I should go," I started, patting Hermione's hand fondly. "Need to tell Montague he has to look for a new Beater."The tears hit in the back of my eyes but I managed to control them and to make my voice sound relaxed and deadpan. However, all of them gave me a pitying look."We are really sorry, Lilith," Angelina said."Yeah, the field is not going to be the same without you and your perfect shots. That shit hurts like fuck." Spinnet talked, trying to erase the tension."Slytherin won't be able to find a Beater like you," Bell added.I thanked them even though those comments only improved how much I wanted to cry. I left alone, thinking where to go because the last thing I wanted at that moment was to go back to the common room and actually accept that I was no longer in my house's team.Finally, I decided to hide in the abandoned loo, Liv and I's favourite spot. Maybe if I was lucky enough she would show up.As soon as I got in there, I took my pack of cigarettes and my lighter from my boot and tried to light a cig with my fingers trembling because of the rage and sadness. At that moment, I heard how the door opened behind me."Liv, you won't believe what happened. I want to fucking jump out of that window." I said chuckling with a trembling voice, still struggling to light the cigarette."I knew you were going to be here," I heard Fred's deep voice instead of Liv's. I turned around and found him with his hands inside of his pockets, still serious."What do you want? I'm waiting for someone," I said still pretty nervous because of his presence and the whole situation."Yeah, Olivia Lovegood, I know," he replied approaching me, looking at his feet, "I wanted to say sorry to you personally. You don't deserve this and I know you love Quidditch."I swallowed hard looking at the unlightened cig, "It's not that deep. I'll get over it.""It is. Remus bragged in front of us how proud he was about you wanting to join the Harpies," he murmured, looking at me straight in the eye, softening his rough look, "It's so unfair, especially when you warned Malfoy more than once. I'm really sorry, darling."In that exact moment, hearing his soft tone and his sincere words, being completely aware of how much it actually hurt me, I couldn't control more myself and I simply burst into tears as I walked fastly to hug him. Probably I only wanted a shoulder to cry on because I was actually waiting for Liv, but my barriers were off and surprisingly, he did correspond to my hug. His arm wrapped my waist, glueing my body to his, and his other hand caressed my hair as I felt him breathe deeply.I hated myself for crying in front of him and looking this vulnerable, especially when the only noises in the entire loo were my sobs and I was noticing how his jumper was getting wet because of my tears but I couldn't restrain myself anymore for today."I'm tired of that woman," I managed to say while his hand in my waist moved to caress my back. "And I can't even light my fucking cigarette.""It's okay, Lilith," he whispered, "Vent, it's okay to do it once in a while."I felt surprised because this was the first time our physical contact had nothing to do with violence or sexual intentions, and I felt a pang of hunger in my guts craving for more moments like this in the future.After a while, we separated, and only illuminated by the moonlight entering the broken window, he took my lightener. I wiped out my tears quickly and put the cigarette on my lips, he lightened it, looking at me straight in the eye. I wasn't able to smile at that moment but I did my best to try and gave him a kind look."Thank you, Fred."He nodded, lighting himself a cig as well. I felt so comfortable in his company and much calmer, even though the deepest part of my brain knew I shouldn't feel like this. Not with him. But I ignored it and enjoyed the moment.I would have time left enough to worry about it.

As soon as I told Montague about the news the entire Slytherin house apologised, especially Draco who was almost crying again. During the next two days, he kept looking for me and I talked to him normally but I still tried to avoid him because I was fucking crossed. I wrote to Pauline and Lupin and Tonks. Pauline sent me lots of hugs and a couple of curses against that bitch in French that I had to ask Liv to translate for me and Remus apologised in a note, telling me Tonks was too angry to even write and offering himself to talk to Umbridge, but I knew it wouldn't work. Even Severus tried to speak with her but that bitch wasn't going to pull back."Do you want me to give you my Transfiguration notes? I saw you weren't paying too much attention," Liv asked while giving a puff to her cig. After finishing lunch, we went straight to the Garden to sit under a tree. I didn't care anymore if Umbridge saw me smoking, she couldn't fuck me up more than she already did.I simply nodded, looking at mine. She was right, since I was suspended from Quidditch I could barely concentrate at any class, I kept thinking about how I was going to train myself for the Harpies without my broom."Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?" She asked me, softly."Yeah, I'll focus on Harry's classes. I still need to pass DADA and be the best student in Slytherin from my course."She puckered, thinking the question in her head before speaking;"Lilith, you know what date is this Saturday, right?" she whispered and I froze in my place.Yes, I knew."Ares's birthday," I simply said. One of my most painful dates. "But don't worry Liv, I'll be fine.""Lilith," we heard a voice behind me. I turned around and Fred was a couple of steps away from me, looking at my eyes with a little smile, a hand in one of the pockets in his trousers and the other grabbing his bag, with his white shirt and his messily tied red tie. Liv hit me not so discreetly, and I opened my eyes widely while trying to look normal. He smiled. "I need to talk to you."Olivia literally pushed me while still looking at Fred, but managed to grab my sleeve and whisper in my ear. "You better tell me what happens lately at dinner."I snickered but winked at her and then, walked straight at ginger who started to walk away to make me follow him.We finally got in front of the entrance to the Gryffindor common room, and when he turned around to look at me, he kept having that mysterious smile. When Fred Weasley was smiling at you like that it could only mean two things, you were about to get fucked or pranked."Well, tell me," I encouraged him to speak."Remember I told you I wasn't done with your birthday presents?" he said, searching in his bag, "Well, I was thinking about giving it to you this weekend but considering the long face you are carrying around I thought it was better if you could enjoy it by now."He handed me a little plastic bag with blue sweets."Give them a try, they're blueberry flavoured,"I quickly opened the bag because even though my belly was full thanks to the lunch I always had enough space for blueberries. I took three and ate them under his curious look."Thanks, Fred."He snickered. Uhmm, I should worry."What you have just eaten, my dear Lilith," he started with a solemn tone, "It's Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes's new creation. Invented and made by me."I felt how my eyes opened widely again, and I thought about spitting the sweets but I had already swallowed them. Shit."What have you given me Fred?" I warned him. If it was some of his jokes I'd kick his ass so hard that he would fly back to the Burrow."I knew you weren't going to spit it.""Fred...""Those sweets are called Blueberry Trembling Teasers. In your honour, of course. And what they do is increase the amount of sensitivity in every single inch of your body." he explained, pretty proud of himself.Oh, Merlin...He came closer to me, with his hands behind his back, and whispered pretty close to my face. "The effect shows in ten minutes after the intake and, thanks to George and Lee keeping my room empty, what I plan to do, if you want to, is to eat you out while you're under the effect of the sweet."I couldn't help but lick my lower lip, still shocked, feeling the air around me becoming hotter."If you don't want to, is okay, of course. You can still enjoy it on your own, the effect doesn't change and the bag is entirely for you.""I want to," I simply said, lowering my head a little bit and biting my lip.Smiling, he walked in front of me to tell the portrait, which didn't look too happy to have a Slytherin in front of her, the password while I couldn't take my eyes off him. This was by far one of the best ideas he could have.Fred made me follow him into the empty common room and upstairs to his room. Casting a Muffliato, while I entered and looked around, he started to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt. It was the first time that I actually looked at his room, since the last time I was so blind by rage I didn't even bother to. With his shirt out, making me almost drool at the view, he approached me."I bet you are already under its effect," he murmured, taking the back of his hand to give a little caress to my neck.The feeling sent a huge current of tingles straight to my clit and a moan escaped from my lips, I quickly clapped my mouth with my hand, also feeling chills. Damn, he was right with the bloody increase of sensitivity.His smile grew widely. "Mmh, yes, you are. Want us to start, darling?"I nodded effusively, feeling already the wetness in between my legs. He turned me on so fast that it was scary.Before I could say any other word, Fred took off my tie and my shirt, while I pulled down my skirt and threw my shoes to the other corner of the room.With me completely naked in front of him and his eyes fixed on mine, he pushed me softly to his bed, making his touch feel like fire to my skin. I let myself fall, opening my legs and playing with my hair, giving him a feline smile and a very complete view of my body.I saw how his eyes covered every part of me, craving, and how he took a deep and slow breath. "So fucking beautiful..."His knees positioned in between my legs with one hand on the bed and the other one resting right under my right breast, making me bite my lip not to moan again. His lips went straight to my neck. I couldn't hold it anymore, it felt like I was constantly at the edge of an orgasm and the goosebumps weren't planning to leave me."Fred..." I moaned in his ear and he ran his tongue on the sensitive skin."Oh, darling we are going to have so much fun with this..."He kept slowly letting his lips cover me; from my breasts where he sucked and kissed, emphasising, to my lower belly and my inner thigh. Fred accommodated himself, laying face down, and spread my legs, with his hands stroking them as I panted. Every single nerve in my body was craving him and the hot atmosphere around us only helped to make me feel his touch even more intimate and burning."Ready, Lilith?" he teased, looking at me straight in the eye, with an eyebrow raised and smirking."Yes, Freddie," I whispered."Happy birthday, darling."His tongue gave a long and slow pass from my entrance to my clit, gaining a loud moan from my lips. It was almost like if I was under the effects of a hard drug and the only thing my brain could focus on was the pleasure. He smiled and made his mouth surround my clit, start sucking and giving slow licks, sending chills all over my body. My hands travelled to his hair to push him even nearer to me and I sensed how he snarled against me. I was already seeing the stars and he had just begun."My perfect little slut...tasting so good just for me," he whispered, giving me a piercing stare that melted my entire body.His hands went to my hips to hold me still as his lips kept kissing my pussy, making sure his passes covered every inch of my most sensitive spot. White dots appeared in my sight and while his tongue moved faster against my clit, I came hard, feeling already the rollercoaster in my body. He separated a little bit and I thought he was going to stand up to pull down his trousers and fuck me properly, but he didn't. Instead, he put my hips closer to his face."What are you doing?" I whispered.Fred's look burnt me, "You thought I was done with you? No, darling, I'm eating you out till you can't handle it anymore."His tongue sunk in my entrance and I gasped louder than I wanted. He kissed me down there, passing my legs over his shoulders to rest them in his back and make the contact even closer. I chuckled in a low and deep voice, closing my eyes and enjoying how he groaned against me making his tongue go deeper, and drinking off me. I felt the knot forming in my guts again and I finished even harder than before."That's a good girl..." he whispered, running the back of his hand through his wet mouth. "Coming just for me..."Fred put his tongue in my clit again and kissed me. By the fourth time I came, his fingers were deep inside of me, coming in and out, my legs were already trembling and the stars in my vision mixed with the view of his fierce eyes gazing shortly at me, while his nose rubbed in my skin with his tongue playing in my clit, melted me."Oh- Freddie..." I whimpered, grabbing the sheets of his bed, moving my hips desperately but uselessly since his hands were holding me still."I could spend the rest of my life eating you out," Fred murmured against me to then, start to pass his tongue again and to eat me out as if I was his last meal. His fingers twisted inside of me while his thumb gave slow circles to my clit and he sucked and kissed my inner thighs. I came hard again, with hoarse moans and laboured breath."Can you keep going, Lilith?" He separated from me a little bit, to run his fingers through his red hair and to catch air, still with that arrogant smile."Oh, are you already tired, Freddie?" I managed to tease him, with my out-of-breath voice and my trembling legs. My eyes went down his body while passing my tongue through my lower lip, noticing he was really hard and probably feeling drowned in his tight trousers. Damn. "You haven't come once, darling, I don't like that," I murmured, running one of my hands through my breasts, watching how his eyes were fixed right there."No, darling, today is about you." He went back down again at the speed of the light and started to suck again my already swollen clit. A loud and raspy whine came out of my mouth as I moved to be closer to his face and his hands forced me to keep my legs open.Fred grabbed my hips and turned us around, making me gasp in a high-pitched voice. He ended up laying lazily on the bed, with one leg bent, and my thighs at each side of his face, sat, with him eating me out again while his hands held me still against him."Fuuuuck!" I moaned, feeling the new sensations hitting me harder than ever. The air in my lungs wasn't enough and I couldn't keep my eyes open. "Freddie, I'm gonna drown you if you keep me in this position," I stuttered, with my voice still kinda high-pitched and out of breath."Believe me, Lilith, this is the sweetest death ever," he whispered, to then go back to lick and drink off me.The way Fred ate me out felt like if he wanted to make sure I was part of him and as if he had spent years without drinking and I was the most delicious feast to his mouth.He moved his tongue in my entrance making his nose rub my clit, gaining a pant out of my lips. My throat was already irritated because of how much I was moaning. His hands caressed my hips, inviting me to move them."Ride me, darling," he groaned, "I know you want to, come on."I moved my hips in slow circles following his tongue's path, while I grabbed his hair with one hand while his were holding my thighs, making sure I couldn't separate from him. As his lips got deep in me and his kisses longer and wetter, I rode faster making Fred moan and feeling him smiling against me.I couldn't form any words, my lips were swollen because of how much I bit them and my voice was almost gone. Feeling already at the edge of the rollercoaster again and the chills in my entire body I leaned myself a little bit back and made my movements slower to feel them even more. I didn't know if I was still under the sweets' effect but fucking hell, that felt good.With the stars in my eyes and my legs trembling more than ever I screamed Freddie's name as I came harder than ever, his hands squeezing my hips and his lips still against me.I moved from him quickly and let my body lay against his. Before letting him speak, I grabbed his face and kissed him passionately, feeling his smile and tasting my own wetness and flavour in his lips."You're fucking incredible," I whispered against his mouth and then bit his lower lip. His smile grew."Did you like it?" he teased me with a raspy voice."Mmmh, I did like it," I smiled looking at him straight in the eye. Slowly I started to leave kisses all over his exposed skin, and he closed his eyes, letting himself enjoy it, clearly exhausted. "And I'm going to reward you for it."I started to unbutton his trousers, pulling them along with his boxers down before he could even reply."Lilith...you don't have to, I did it because it was your birthday and because I wanted," he complained, looking at me with puppy eyes."And I'm doing this because I want to as well," I responded, completely confident. "Come on, Freddie. Don't tell me you don't want to cum in my mouth." I teased him, kissing his hips and feeling his hard dick below me."Fuck yes I do," he groaned, tilting his head back.I grabbed his dick and stroking him slowly, I ran my tongue through his red tip that claimed my attention, even slower. A raspy moan left his lips, inviting me to repeat and hearing him gasp."Damn, I'm not going to last too much, I already warn you," he said, panting, and running his fingers through his hair, closing his eyes again and trying to catch his air back."I don't care, Freddie. I just want you to cum for me," I whispered, and then, took as much of him as I could inside my mouth making sure my hand was still stroking the part I couldn't reach. Moving my head up to down slowly at first and then gradually faster, making sure my tongue pleasured him and my lips were tight around him, my eyes lifted and met his, watching it coming in and out."Oh, Lilith..." he whispered back, managing not to stutter and being interrupted by his own moan. His hand travelled to my hair and my other hand rested in his hip. I gave a slow lick all around his dick and then sucked again. "You can't imagine how I needed this."With a trembling and laboured breath, Fred's moans became louder as his head tilted back again. Making our eyes meet again, I ran my tongue from the base to his tip making sure he had a full view and giving him my most feline look. It was enough for him to reach his edge because his eyes closed hard and his head rested on the pillow, with his superficial and broken breath and a last loud and raspy whimper. I swallowed his cum and while raising my body back, being on my still trembling knees I passed my tongue through my lips to show him.He snickered with his dilated pupils and shiny eyes, trying to normalize his breathing again."What a woman..." Fred murmured, making me chuckle back and lifting his exhausted body only to grab my waist and make me fall upon his chest.Oh, you don't even know, Freddie...

As soon as I got my breath back, I went straight to my room and told Liv everything, which only provoked her to be talking to me about Fred almost all the time. Later that day and the next one, I started to feel with a heavy heart as Saturday approached. I tried not to let anyone notice - even though I told Hermione in one of our nights about how much my father's birthday affected me - because I conceived it as something weak of me. How I can still be so attached to the man who abandoned me when I was still almost a baby?"Lilith..." Neville talked to me on Friday night, after finishing Harry's classes. His tone was firmer than ever. "Hermione mentioned that tomorrow is not a very happy day for you and she asked us to keep an eye on you. I want you to know I'm here if you need anything."I felt my blood freezing in my veins as I swallowed hard, Olivia and I looked at each other at the same time."Who else knows?" Liv asked in a whisper."Uhmm, she told Harry, Ron, Ginny, the twins and me," he replied counting with his fingers.Oh, fucking hell, Hermione..."Thank you so much, Nev." I thanked him while interlacing my hand with Liv's and starting to walk away slowly."She didn't do it with bad intentions," Liv said as soon as we got out of the Room of Requirement."I know and I don't blame her, but it has always been a private matter."I accompanied Liv back to her common room and as I walked back to the dungeons, trying to keep my mind blank, I saw Fred and George walking as well back to their place."Oi, Weasley!" I shouted, calling their attention as I ran to them. "Hi, Georgie. I'll need more of that thing you gave me when I caught you with the Marauder's Map."Fred, the one I talked straightly to, furrowed his eyebrows. "Why would you want that?""Mate, I'll see you in the room, ok? Lilith, if you need anything you know where to find me," George interrupted, walking away and waving back at me.I forced myself to smile at him and then focused again on Fred."Do you have more?""I do but...""Would you give me a bit?" I threw in the air a galleon, making it end up in his hand."Is it because of tomorrow?" He connected the dots, looking at me confused. "Hermione told us it's a difficult date for you but she didn't mention why."I deliberated in my head for a few seconds whether I should tell him or if it was too private and exposing myself too much, but considering I knew he wasn't going to give me the herb if I didn't tell him and I really needed it to soften my thoughts tomorrow, I opted to tell him the truth:"It is... Ares Arambella's birthday," I whispered, looking at my feet. At first, I thought he didn't hear me but his long sigh proved me wrong."Your father.""If you can call him that..."He clicked his tongue and took out a little bag from his pocket. "Here you go," he threw it to me. "But you don't have to do drugs to feel better, Lilith. I know if I don't give it to you, you'll manage to get it anyway but, really, drowning in your own misery is not the best.""I'm not going to that, Fred. I'll only have a cig and relax. Everyone's acting as if I was going to explode or something, I'm okay, I promise!""Aha, and I'm a dyed ginger," he ironized, making me snort with a giggle."Tomorrow you will see I'm fine, Hermione just exaggerated a bit, that's it."✵ ✵ ✵I woke up that morning with my cheeks full of my own tears. As in all of his birthdays, I dreamt with the day he left me; his green eyes, just like mine, looking at me with coldness and pity at the same time, closing the door behind him, leaving me alone in the Arambella house while he was supposed to be taking care of me while mother was working in the laboratory. Mother said he left us because he had the hope I'd be a muggle like him because he couldn't deal with two witches at the same time and the amount of magic and chaos that it would carry.I never knew if that was true or not, but the abandonment was what drove my mother to get closer to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's ideas and to quit her job as a renowned Potions investigator and become one of His most loyal followers.I was only two years old when I lost my father, and only a year later, I lost my mother.Since I have memory, I have always blamed myself for it and I have craved that paternal love I knew I would never have. My mother used to tell me I looked just like him. With her hoarse voice through the cells in Azkaban, with that grey mist around us, she would trap my little wrists to drag me closer to her, scrutinise my face and then, spit next to me; you are just like your father, Lili.Standing up from my bed with Circe's voice in my head, I picked one of my cassettes and let it play while grabbing the herb Fred gave me last night. I wasn't going out of my room any time soon.I laid down in my bed again and the first puff felt like glory.The rest of the men in my life always followed Ares's path, after all, they never cared about me enough to stay.I had no memory of the hours that I spent alone after he left until Circe arrived from work and knew what happened, but I did remember how much I cried that night when I saw my mother devastated, shouting his name to the air, ripping all his portraits, destroying all his objects... how she approached me that night and hugged me in her arms with the most gloomy and deadly sweet tone; it's you and me now, Lili. We will get our revenge, I promise.Those words will haunt me for the rest of my life.Another puff."Lilith," I heard Draco calling me from behind my locked door, with a careful voice."Leave me alone, Draco," I said, deadpan, as I took the joint to my lips again and I felt my body digging itself more in my bed.It doesn't matter how many years passed, I will always have that dim memory of the sound of his voice, his touch, his frivolity, his snake-like stare. For being a muggle, he would have been a hella intimidating wizard.A little snort went out of my mouth when I noticed I didn't even know if he was dead or alive, or if he married again to some pretty muggle girl and had pretty normal and muggle children with whom he did stay, or if he ever thought about me or even felt repentant and tried to get back. I'll never know because if I survive this war, I'm erasing from my memory anything related to Ares Arambella.I prepared another joint and smoked it almost as fast as the first one, with his last words in my head.Good night, Lili.A simple and mundane sentence he said the last night before leaving and not coming back again. He was so desperate to be far from Circe and me that he didn't even care to leave his own house. He was so desperate that the bank account full of muggle money was untouched. He simply wanted to leave.I will never forgive him. For leaving me, for having so much of him in me, for making my life so miserable."Lilith!" I thought I heard Liv's voice from behind my door. I didn't stand up, though.With the music and the smoke covering my room, I cursed Fred Weasley in my mind for giving me so little herb. I needed to not think, to not feel.The door opened as quickly as it closed again, letting the blonde enter the room and ran to turn down the music till the point it was only a low bunch of murmurs."Lilith..." she whispered, looking at me with watery eyes."You came, Liv" I replied, with a trembling voice, swallowing, trying not to cry again."Of course I did! Draco came running and told me you didn't want to get out of here. I knew you were probably drowning yourself in your sadness.""I'm such a mess, Liv," I whispered, high enough to be looking like a toddler, and trying to reach my pack of cigarettes which Olivia took away from me."You aren't.""Yes, I am. I don't deserve you to be here, taking care of me. I'm a selfish bitch who doesn't deserve anything, and the least I deserve is a friend as loyal and good as you. You should be out there, having fun, shagging Pauline and marrying her, fuck. Not here covered in my misery as you always are.""Fuck off, Lilith," she said, sitting in my bed, making her tone harsh and severe, catching my arms to make me sit. "If I'm here is because you are my sister.""It's unfair to you...""It's not! Have you forgotten how you helped to cure my two-year depression when mum died? Luna was too young, and Dad was devastated... If it wasn't because of you-" she swallowed hard, "I probably wouldn't be here."That was enough for making me burst into tears again and throw myself to hug her deeply."He left me, Liv." I cried in her shoulder while she caressed my back.I heard her sobbing as well. "I'm really sorry, sister. You deserve to be loved and adored, he wasn't enough for you.""No, I wasn't enough for him. I'm not enough for anyone. My father, Severus, Cedric... all always end up leaving me when I need them the most. I will never be enough...""You will... One day, someone will look at you as all of us who love you do, Lilith. Someone will look at you as if you were their biggest treasure. They will take care of you, they will love you. And you will always have me by your side, no matter what." she whispered, with a trembling voice, caressing my hair.My head was dizzy and I hug her tightly, letting my head rest on her shoulder."That person might be closer than what you think..." she continued. "Probably you don't want to hear this, but Fred-""I can't love Fred, Liv," I whispered with a calm tone, interrupting her, with my eyes fixed on my wall. "He deserves more than me. He is so happy, so full of light, how I could be so selfish to love him? I would only drag him into my darkness and make him leave me.""You are not giving yourself the chance...""I can't love him" I swallowed hard as the tears went back to my eyes, " and not expect him to abandon me as soon as my love grows making him become the air I breathe and to feel I'm drowning without him. If the only man that was supposed to love me unselfishly, through all, who was supposed to protect me" my mouth became dry, " left me, how can I not expect everyone else to do so too? Every man I ever loved, ended up leaving me, Liv. Ares was just the first one to do it. And Fred, oh Merlin, Fred is too good. I can't start to love him and see how he gradually becomes more like my father, ending up...abandoning me. I can't turn off his light. I can't be like my mother. I can't.""Oh, Lilith..."We spent a couple of hours hugging in my bed, till the effect of the herb went off and she convinced me to stand up to go out. Once out of my room, I found Draco sitting on the stairs with his hands on his hair. As soon as he saw us, he ran towards me and hugged me tightly, not caring about what my response could be.There were no words needed, I thanked him silently and he let me go. Once we got out of the common room, it was already nighttime. The moon shined full and high in the starry sky and the cold air from autumn moved my hair, surrounding me in a soft but cold cuddle.I didn't even arrive at the Hall when I saw him. A little smile, shiny brown eyes, messy ginger hair and a cigarette hanging from his lips, leaning arrogantly against the wall. As soon as our eyes met, his smile grew a little bit."Go talk to him, he is good for you," Liv whispered in my ear. "I'll see you in the Hall."I walked straight to Fred, slowly because my muscles were still trying to wake up from the effect, and without breaking eye contact. I stood up in front of him with his eyes not leaving me once."Hello, darling," he whispered, soft and slow. A cold breeze hugged us, in contrast with his corporal heat."Hey," I said with a soft murmur, noticing how a little dreamy smile formed on my lips."How are you feeling?""I have had best days," I shrugged. He took a puff, with his eyes still on me."Next time, Lilith, open to me. Can't do very much, but I'm a great listener and at least I have tissues enough for your tears," he slightly joked making his smile kinder, and in a really calm and soft tone, not mocking me, not judging me.I smiled too. It was the nicest emotion I felt the whole day."It's amazing," he whispered, taking a long and deep breath. "Even with your watery eyes, you are still breathtakingly beautiful..."Another cold breeze covered us and since Fred noticed how I was trembling, he grabbed my waist and pulled me closer to him, glueing our bodies and letting me feel his corporal warmth. Still staring at me, he took a long puff. Then, making his eyes go down to my mouth, he freed the smoke in my lips, letting me breathe it from him.I felt a soft flame inside of me. First in my chest, and then, expanding all over my body. I grinned slightly at his delicate touch in my back through my shirt, his smile, the way he rubbed his nose with mine slowly and the stars shining back in his eyes.For once in a long time, I wasn't cold.

Soon, we got to the last reunion of the DA before the Christmas break. I knew I was going to keep seeing the Weasleys and Hermione during holidays and probably spend a lot of time with Remus and Tonks so I was way more cheerful than these last days. After my encounter with Fred during my father's birthday, I tried to keep some distance between us and hang out mainly just with Liv and Luna in the Hufflepuff common room or stay in my own one, looking at the depths of the lake. Fred seemed not to take it too seriously since his main concern at that moment was to make sure his business with his brother was going well and I was happy for him. Even with the steps we had taken since we started this weird and supposed 'truce', there was still a big line that separated us in so many ways and, at that moment, for his own sake and mine, I wanted to keep it like that."Arambella!" Alicia Spinnet called me, making me stop talking to Liv and Luna. "Any news about the new Slytherin Beater?"I sighed hard and disappointed, still feeling gutted about that even though I already saw the training of the new team without me."Yeah, Montague chose this Goyle kid.""Fuck, that's bad for your team...""It is. What about you? Any replacement for Harry and the twins?""Aye, Ginny Weasley's our new seeker! And Kirke and Sloper 're the Beaters, not the best ones though but couldn't get anyone better..."Kirke was one of the biggest show-offs in Gryffindor and Sloper loved to mess with younger Slytherins, better for me not to meet them at the field."Lilith," I heard Ginny talking to me with a huge smile on her face and the twins behind her. "What a pity you are not anymore in the Slytherin team, I'd have liked playing with you."I smiled at her, still a bit puzzled about her kindness. I think I'll never get used to so many Gryffindors being nice to me."Thank you, Ginny! But it doesn't matter anymore. I'll be back at Quidditch with the Harpies this September." I replied, proud of myself. I had been working on it a lot even though I didn't have my broom, so I still had my hopes up about getting a place in the team.Ginny's brown eyes shined reminding me of his brother's, opening her mouth widely, almost not believing it."The Harpies?! Really?!""Do you like them?""They're my favourite team!""Really? Well, then maybe if I pass the tryouts and you are a good player, I could get you on the team as well. Once you finish Hogwarts, of course."The girl grinned with pure excitement, almost whopping. Harry's interruption stopped our conversation."Since this is our last magic defence class before Christmas," he said solemn, giving me a quick look because I had finished my schedule of muggle combat classes before him. "We will just revise what we learnt before."I paired again with Neville, staying next to Liv and Luna who hyped up the Gryffindor boy to make sure he was confident enough and his tries were more efficient. Later, we practised the stunning spell against the whole lot and I managed to throw George Weasley to the other corner of the room."Bloody hell, why am I always the one flying away?" he pretended to complain, smiling while he stood up.After an hour, Harry talked again, smiling;"All of you are doing it great. Once we are back from the break, we could try more serious things; maybe the Patronus enchantment."A bunch of excited and curious whispers covered the room, I was pretty happy with that since the Patronus was one of my favourite enchantments and thanks to Remus, I could form a fully corporeal one. I still remember the amazed and curious look on his face when the German Shepard came out of my wand, flying around us.While everyone was talking between them before leaving, I saw Cho Chang a bit out of the crowd, with watery eyes. Even though I had never talked with her before, I decided to approach her."Hey," I drawled. "Is something going wrong?"She looked at me, and for a second I thought she would just tell me to fuck off, but she didn't."Oh, don't worry, I'm only thinking about Cedric." Cho stuttered, playing with the tissue in her hands.I noticed how that little wound in my heart I thought it was closing, opened dimly again. Before I could tell her something a bit comforting, she spoke again;"I know it's a bit annoying to see me crying everywhere, that's why I try to stay a bit out of the crowd."I couldn't help but frown my eyebrows."Annoying? Girl, you lost someone you loved! It's completely understandable that you are crying, what the fuck is wrong with people?""Lilith!" I heard how Liv called me, ready to leave to have dinner with her and Luna in her room."Listen, I've got to go but don't let anyone tell you whether if you can cry for your boyfriend or not, ok? I know we never talked before but, as Cedric's friend, you can talk to me whenever you want if you need it."She thanked me and I left her with Harry to follow Olivia out of the Room of Requirement.Liv, Luna and I enjoyed a good feast for the three of us in Liv's room with some music in the background and talking about how our classes were going. It was so cosy and heartwarming that having to go back to my dorm actually fucked me up a bit. When I got to the Slytherin common room I greeted Blaise with a high-five and nodded my head to Draco, to whom I still held a bit of grudge.I fell asleep as soon as my head touched my pillow.✵ ✵ ✵"Lilith!" Someone whispered in my ear. "Lilith! Wake up!"I opened my eyes, struggling, and found Draco looking at me with worry on his face."What happened?" I asked him, feeling my typical deep and hoarse sleepy voice."Your uncle is out of the common room. He says he needs you to go with him right now."What? Still confused, I put on a thin robe and went out looking for Snape. I found him right where Draco told me, and before even talking to me, he grabbed my wrist and dragged me by the corridor."Severus, what is going on? Why you woke me up? It is still midnight!""I need you to go to Grimmauld Place right now for the Christmas break.""Huh?""Arthur Weasley was attacked in the Ministry, he was seriously injured and the Order suspects it has to do with dark magic, I want you to be under the protection I can't give you here or at Spinner's End."I fully woke up as soon as I heard Mr Weasley had been hurt and noticing how my heart bumped against my chest, I let Snape guide me to Dumbledore's office. My mind was so immersed in my own thoughts that I didn't even hear the password; if it was dark magic what hurt Mr Weasley did that mean He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was trying to attack the original members of the Order first?"But wait - Liv..."He didn't let me finish. "Your friend will know soon, stay calm. Maybe she can visit you if we make sure Xenophillus Lovegood takes the required precautions."Once we got up there, I found Harry looking pretty stiff and anxious and the Weasleys, who all had a scared and worried expression on their faces. Fred had his eyes focused in one place in the ground, breathing heavily and with his mouth kinda opened, concerned and surprised, still in his pyjama and with his ginger hair completely messy. Hermione was there as well and had her arm around a trembly Ginny."My niece will go to Black's house as well, sir, as you suggested," Snape spoke, addressing Dumbledore.The old man didn't look at me once. Instead, he told Fred that since the floo powder was too dangerous at that moment, we will have to use a portkey. While he continued giving his explanations, a little fire happened in the room and immediately extinguished. Where the flame was before, it had appeared a golden feather."It's Fawkes," Dumbledore announced, catching it before it got to the ground. "Professor Umbridge knows you are out of your dorms... Minerva, go and distract her, tell her whatever you want.""He says it's a pleasure," a bored voice interrupted behind Dumbledore. The portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black appeared in front of the Slytherin banner. "My great-great-grandson has always had a very peculiar taste for his guests."Dumbledore made us catch a part of the dirty kettle he handed us, making sure all of us had used a portkey before.While the magic started working, making the room spin around us at a great velocity, I closed my eyes. Apparations always gave me headaches.Walburga Black's sweet voice gave us the welcome to Grimmauld from her portrait spitting every kind of insult her archaic mind could think of. Sirius and Remus appeared in front of us pretty worried. Remus made eye contact with me soon and stayed by my side."What happened?" he asked me, worried."I don't know..." I stuttered, still surprised and sleep-deprived."Phineas Nigellus told me Arthur Weasley is seriously injured," Black talked, looking at his godson, emitting a dim alcohol smell."Ask Harry," Fred suggested."Yeah, I want to know too," George continued.All of us stared at the mentioned one. With a shaky voice and not too confident, he spoke."It was - I had a....kind of - vision."And then, he proceeded to give us every single detail, describing the way he saw how a huge snake attacked the poor man. I saw how Ronald was paler than the rest of his siblings, who still were listening to Harry, pretty carefully."Is our mother here?" Fred asked Sirius, who shook his head."Probably she doesn't even know. The most important thing was to get you lot out of Hogwarts before Umbridge could interfere. I suppose Dumbledore is telling Molly.""We need to go to St Mungo's," Ginny spluttered, looking at her brothers who were still in their pyjamas. "Sirius, can you let us borrow some cloaks or something?""Wait a moment! You can't go to St Mungo's yet!" the man interrupted."Of course we can go if we want to!" Fred replied, looking more convinced than ever. "It's our father!"The two of them started an argument in which George quickly added himself. Remus tried to put peace, but obviously, it didn't work."We don't care about the damn Order!" Fred shouted."Our father is dying!" George followed.I didn't open my mouth once because I didn't have a say in it and I understood both sides. If I had had a paternal figure like Arthur Weasley I would have moved heaven and earth to be with him at the Hospital. Even if something like this happened to Severus, I would be fucking pissed off if they didn't let me see him and be with him. But at the same I understood Sirius's point of view, Harry's situation wasn't easy to explain and without knowing exactly what attacked Mr Weasley, it could be really really dangerous out there."This is why you two are not in the Order! You don't understand it but certain things are worth to die for!" Sirius claimed."It's so easy to say when you are locked in here!" Fred shouted. "You aren't risking yourself at all, are you?!"Oh, damn. I hissed, surprised, looking at how a cold fury invaded Sirius's eyes making him look like an actual heir of the Black family. He looked like wanted to slap Fred really harsh."Padfoot..." Remus called him while being next to me. "Calm down a little bit, mate. You have to understand their frustration. "Sirius continued with his rough look but talked more calmed;"I know it's hard, but we must pretend that we don't know anything yet. We should stay here at least until we get news from your mother, alright?"Fred and George kept infuriated but Ginny got to the closest chair and sat there, waiting. The twins ended up repeating her action."That's right," Sirius said, calmer than before. "Now, let's- let's have a drink. Accio butterbeer!"Before anything else could happen, a message, such as the one Dumbledore got in his office, appeared in front of us. Sirius didn't recognise Dumbledore's handwriting in the note so he handed it to George, knowing that probably was from Mrs Weasley."Dad is still alive. I'm going now to St Mungo. Stay right there where you are, I'll send the news as soon as I can. Mum." George read aloud."He's still alive..." he repeated slowly. " That sounded as..."

 if Mr Weasley was between life and death and 

if they didn't actually know if he would make it. Bloody hell...After a while, Sirius suggested all of us go to sleep but the Weasleys' deadly stare, me shaking my head and Harry's eyes open widely, said otherwise. Remus told the twins and Ron to sit again but Fred didn't listen, he leaned himself, scowling, against the wall with crossed arms. I was feeling bad for him but honestly, I didn't know what to do or what to say and probably, he considered this too private for him to share it with me."Why don't you tell him something? You probably can help him," Remus suggested to me, whispering in my ear, with his eyes on the ginger.I looked at him confused. How could I be helpful to him? However, I nodded."Great. I'll talk to you tomorrow, once we know Arthur is out of danger," he added, giving a little caress to my hair and leaving a quick fatherly kiss on my cheek. I couldn't hold the smile that appeared on my face after that demonstration of affection.I walked slowly to Fred, whose eyes were still looking at the floor as his eyebrows kept frowned."Do you want to go upstairs to the rooftop to catch some fresh air? Maybe it can help to cool your head." I murmured with the softest tone I could find. He looked at me for a short second and nodded, keeping his eyes on the floor.He started to walk pretty fast and I followed him trying to keep up with his speed. Fred opened the rooftop's door in a slam and went straight to the corner where months ago he found me. I let him a bit of privacy, standing in the middle of the rooftop, a good couple of steps away from him.I heard how he took deep breaths, how he ran his fingers through his hair, and how he considered having a cig, but put the pack back in his sweat pyjama pants, frustrated."Fred..." I asked, softly. Feeling the cold night air wrapping me.The next thing that followed was the dim sound of his sobs and how he vented right there, without caring if I was present. I felt a huge pain in my chest, like hundreds of needles stabbing me, and I couldn't help but run towards him and hug his back."Fred...he is going to be okay, you'll see. He is a strong man. He has so much to live for." I whispered rubbing my cheek against his back.The ginger turned around, looking at me with his watery brown eyes and biting his lips to hold back his sobs, I felt my heart shrinking at that view. I thought he would ask me to leave him alone, but how could I if he was so heartbroken? Deeply inside of my mind, I wished I could be able to take his pain away and suffer it myself, I wished I could save Arthur Weasley and show it to him to vanish his sadness.He hugged me and melted in my arms, sobbing a bit louder and hiding his face between my neck and my collarbone. Even though he was taller than me, I managed to hug him back and caress his hair as I let him vent with me."I can't lose my father, Lilith," he whispered, no shaky or out-of-breath voice, just his emotions on edge."You will not, Fred. I'm staying with you here and you will see that your dad will come back safe." I assured him, sounding more convinced of my words than I actually was. I didn't want to fill him with empty hopes but I really wanted to believe that Mr Weasley was going to heal. After all, he was an innocent good man that took care of his family."Thanks, Lilith," he whispered so low that for a moment, I thought I had dreamt it. But I hugged him tightly and whispered back;"There's nothing to thank me for. I really mean it."We stayed like that, hugging with the cold air around us and the absolute silence of the midnight in a rich street of London, letting him free his emotions with me - something I never imagined from Fred Weasley - and comforting him, wishing I could take all his pain away.

After a couple of hours waiting for news, Ginny was laying on the couch staring at the ceiling, Ronald had his head between his arms and it was impossible to know if he was awake or not, George was almost asleep and Fred was completely asleep in one of the couches with his head hanging over one of his shoulders. In my mind, I wanted to accommodate him so he could sleep better and maybe even cuddle and sleep with him, but it was such an intimate act that I retrained myself from it. Also, I was scared of him witnessing one of my nightmares since only Liv and Hermione seemed to annul them.I tried to close my eyes for a bit but it was impossible, so I ended up having my third tea and later, my second black coffee with Remus and Sirius."Look at him," Remus said, sitting by my side with a little smile, staring at Fred. "He even looks innocent..."A little chuckle escaped from my lips."You used to say the same about me, Moony." Sirius smiled, whispering."You never looked innocent, Padfoot."Sirius snorted offended but also amused."He had a tough night," I murmured with a soft voice. Once we got out of the rooftop, Fred wiped out his tears as we got downstairs and didn't say any other word. Of course, I wasn't going to mention to anybody how he vented up there with me."You calmed him a lot, Lilith," Remus smiled, giving me a little caress in my hand."Yeah, I don't know how you have patience enough, kid. You sure you are Snape's niece?""Unluckily, yes, I'm his niece.""Don't say that, Lilith. He got you the tryouts with the Harpies and it was fully his idea.""Bah, Moony! It was the least he could do for her! Don't praise him for the bare minimum, he is still a fucker." Sirius laughed, giving a quick sip to his beer. "And he was lucky I can't go out but I would have got you in the team without tryouts needed."At five in the morning according to Ronald's watch, the kitchen's door opened and Mrs Weasley appeared in it. She was extremely pale but when she saw all our eyes were on her, she forced herself to smile."He will be fine," Molly Weasley announced with a weak voice that denoted tiredness. "He's now sleeping. Later we can visit him. Bill is there with him."Fred let himself sit again and covered his face with his hands. Ginny and George ran to their mother and hugged her while Ron laughed nervously. When Ginny separated from her mum, I hugged her tightly and kissed her forehead, showing her my support.With my eyes still on Fred, who stayed in the same position, I walked and stood behind his chair. Not knowing too well what to do, I put my hand on his shoulder and caressed it slightly and slowly, with one of his hands still on his face, he took the other one to mine and gave me a quick and delicate squeeze. I stared right there where our hands were touching, something simple and conventional but that we never did before, until he quickly got up and walked to the kitchen.Apparently, Sirius had called us to have breakfast. Since Kreacher didn't come, Harry and I stood up to help Sirius, mainly because he didn't seem like the kind of being a master chef but when Potter was taking some plates from the cupboard, Mrs Weasley hugged him and thanked him for saving Mr Weasley's life with his vision. Then she thanked Sirius and Remus for taking care of her children the whole night, Black replied to her saying he hoped they could stay here the entire holidays and she nodded. Then, Harry asked Sirius to talk privately so I kept preparing breakfast on my own."Lilith, dear, let me help you," Remus said, standing up to help me."No, it's okay.""It's not, you've been awake the whole night. I bet you are incredibly tired.""So have you, Remus. I can do it.""Two are quicker than one.""Three," Hermione corrected him, standing up as well and positioning by my side."You haven't slept in the entire night?" Fred asked making eye contact with me for the first time, sounding more serious than what he probably meant.I shook my head."Why?" George asked, confused too, but more serene."I dunno, simply couldn't. I was too nervous to sleep.""She sat with Sirius and me to have coffee and tea while chatting. But she's going to sleep the whole day, aren't you?" Remus smiled at me, passing his arm over my shoulder and giving me a sweet caress.I purred nodding and smiling. My bed appeared in my head as the sweetest and appealing thing in the world."Kid, you have the biggest dark circles I've ever seen," Mrs Weasley spoke a bit concerned. For a moment, I thought she wasn't addressing me. How could she when she was using such a kind tone? But she stood up and walked towards me, examining me."It's okay, I'm used to them," I assured with a low voice, but she didn't go back.Standing in front of me, a noticed how small she actually was, even with her head raised to look at me, she probably only reached me to the height of my shoulder.Mrs Weasley grabbed her wand and put it against the skin under my eyes, ignoring how I instinctively flinched when she pointed at me. With some silent spell, I noticed how my skin became smoother. I was still tired but at least I wasn't looking as if I haven't slept in seven years and spent my days doing heroine.I looked at her surprised and a little smile popped off my face. "Thank you, Mrs Weasley."She slightly scowled, like if even herself was surprised by what she just did, but gave me a brief smile as well and sat down again, confused.My eyes went straight to Remus who was also surprised, but quickly invited me to sit down as he finished putting the food on the plates.After eating in not an uncomfortable silence, we all went up to sleep. As we were going to our room, Hermione interlaced her arm with mine."What Mrs Weasley did down there..." she said, surprised. "Was weird."I nodded, still confused."Do you want to sleep with me? Just to make sure the nightmares don't appear so you can have a proper rest." She suggested, already in our room. It felt weird to be back there after the surrealist summer and the new school year."Yes, please," I replied. "Do you mind if I take some clothes off? this house is extremely warm..."She shrugged, showing that she didn't care so I took off my clothes, only staying in my shirt and my underwear. Apparently, Snape hadn't sent yet my stuff. I hid a big smile when I saw how Hermione was blushing and biting her lip discreetly."Oh, also, I tend to hug Liv when I'm asleep, is that a problem for you if I do the same now?""No worries," she said, getting inside the bed at the same time as me. "Sorry if I wake you up later, Mrs Weasley asked me to go with them to visit Mr Weasley at St. Mungo.""No problem, good night, 'Mione," I smiled at her."Night night, Lilith."We quickly fell completely asleep and I barely noticed when I hugged Hermione or when she left. I was so tired, that luckily for me, I didn't even dream."Lilith," I noticed someone moving me to wake me up.I snorted, complaining."Lilith. Shit." I heard how one of Hermione's books fell from the nightstand. My mind immediately recognised that clumsiness. When I opened my eyes, I found Tonks looking at me with a huge smile on her face, her purple hair, and the Auror uniform."Tonks!" I got up from the bed and jumped in her arms, hugging her tightly."Here's my favourite bitch." she corresponded to my hug, laughing. "I missed you lots!""Not more than what I missed you! What are you doing here?" I asked surprised, separating a bit from her."We just arrived from taking the Weasley kids and Harry to see Arthur Weasley. Remus told me you were here sleeping.""Wait, what time is it?" I scowled, confused. How long have I been sleeping?"Like half-past seven."Oh shit, I slept the entire day. Looking through the room for my clothes, I saw my trunk in the corner. Probably, Severus sent it in the afternoon. I put on clean clothes and ran downstairs with Tonks.We found that everyone was hanging out in the living room, with some beers and snacks."Sleepy Beauty is up!" Sirius joked when he saw me. "Did you rest well?""Really well, too well actually, why didn't you wake me up if I was sleeping this much?""You were too tired, kid. You deserved to rest as much as you wanted, it's Christmas holidays!" he said, handing me a beer. "Remus tried to go upstairs to bring you some food but I convinced him to let you sleep, you would wake up by yourself once you were hungry."Remus shrugged, with a tired and sleepy smile looking at Black."However, I couldn't convince him not to go upstairs every ten minutes to check you weren't having a nightmare, I'm surprised he didn't wake you up.""Thanks, Remus." I smiled at him."There's nothing to thank for, Lilith."I sat in one of the arms of the armchairs where Tonks was sitting with one of her legs in the other arm."How is Molly?" she asked the Weasleys who were talking between each other."Mum's alright. She wanted to stay with dad even though he is completely out of danger and fine." Ginny said, giving a sip of her butterbeer."Olivia Lovegood sent you a letter this morning, Lilith," Remus said, standing up to give it to me.She was telling me that Snape told her why I had to go so soon and how incredibly pissed off Umbridge was. How she was right now with Pauline, hugging, kissing, and enjoying life a little bit in the French girl's personal apartment in Toulouse since her parents, who were incredibly rich, lived in a mansion close to Versailles. Liv signed with her name full of hearts, as usual, wanting to visit me next week now that Mr Weasley was out of danger and that Sirius allowed her to come. I thanked Sirius for it and relaxed knowing that my best friend was with her girlfriend having a great time."We adults should have heavier drinks, don't we? I have a great vodka in the cupboard.""Sirius...""Come on, Moony! It's Christmas!""Only a bottle of vodka," Remus warned him, and Sirius nodded like a toddler."We want to have a bit as well!" The twins said and stood up, at the same time."Uhmm, are you old enough?" Sirius teased them, raising his eyebrow and looking at them not too convinced."Yes, we will be eighteen in April," George said."So you aren't of legal age in the muggle world, huh? Mmh, well I don't know if I should let you, this is a muggle drink...""C'mon, Sirius! It's not like we had never drunk before," George complained."Oh, what?! What Mommy Weasley would say if she finds out?!" Sirius smiled devilishly, pretending to be shocked."We will delete your name from the Map if you don't let us drink," Fred smirked, crossing his arms, making his shirt tighter.Black laughed out loud, " You can't do that, kid. It's impossible to erase one of the Marauders from the map. But just because you tried and I'm a cool adult, I'll let you."Sirius gave us a shot and knowing the twins liked more beer than vodka I waited for them to drink it first just to see their reactions.They both made funny faces, trying to swallow the drink. Sirius cleared his throat, Remus coughed a bit and Tonks whooped, shaking her head. She was as well more a beer-girl than a vodka one.They all looked at me devilishly for my reaction, assuming I'd make funny faces as well or not be able to handle it.I took the biggest glass and drank it at once, staring at all of them, deadpan. Their smiles faded and observed me surprised."What?" I asked, pretending to be confused."Wow," Ron said from the other corner of the room while Harry was with his eyes opened widely. Hermione seemed amused, Tonks proud, and the rest were just shocked."Lilith!" Remus laughed, still surprised"How-?" George asked shaking his head."Lots of muggle parties with Liv," I shrugged, laughing.Fred raised his eyebrows and slightly smirked."Wow," Sirius chuckled. " Shit, she's one of the hard ones, isn't she? Damn, Moony, imagine if Snivellus finds out about this! HA! His perfect little niece drinks like a bloody fish.""He'd probably disinherit me if he finds out I'm out there ruining Snape's family reputation." I laughed."He would! How did you manage to go to the parties though?""Xenophillus Lovegood.""Of course! I should have known, one of the coolest guys I've ever met!" Sirius continued. "Wow, kid are you completely sure you are Snivellus's niece? You can tell us, we're trusty enough.""I don't know anymore," I said serving me another drink and we kept laughing and chatting, some of my party stories popped off from my mouth making everyone laugh but I didn't care anymore. I bet Liv would have loved to remember the memories."...So I kissed this girl at the loo when I was consoling her from her breakup with her boyfriend. Well, she kissed me first, after saying she was straight but she was so stoned and, honestly I was as well, that we didn't care, just made out right there." I chuckled, remembering the girl with shiny brown eyes, olive skin and black hair, " It would have ended better if Liv hadn't interrupted saying the girl's ex-boyfriend was out of the loo waiting to talk to her.""Oh, Merlin," Sirius snickered."That's my girl!" Tonks high-fived me."I didn't know you liked girls too," George said, amused. While Fred by his side was resting his elbows over his legs, hands interlaced, staring at me with a smirk on his face."Of course I do! I'm not stupid.""Lilith, you should tell the one you told me! When you and Liv ended up in Wales by accident and-""Oh, no!" I stopped her, blushing and laughing. "That story is too much for their innocent ears."Hermione laid down, laughing even more, as the rest chuckled as well."Instead, I should go to the kitchen to grab me a butterbeer before the vodka affects me too much."I stood up and went straight to the fridge where a cold pack of butterbeer were waiting for me, I didn't even bother to turn on the lights and I was too lazy to take out my wand from my boot so I tried to walk back to the door without crashing.When I was about to get out, I felt someone pinning me against the countertop, making me gasp. Facing the wall, and with a tall body pressed against mine, I felt someone breathing in my ear and a soft caress in my arm."Fred?" I whispered, trying to turn around but he put his hand in my abdomen stopping me. The ginger left some wet and warm kisses on my neck, making a contrast between his burning mouth and my cold skin. A little moan escaped from my lips and I let my head rest on his shoulder."Fred, someone can catch us," I forced myself to whisper, even though the adrenaline to be caught was already making me wet and feel tingles concentrating in between my legs."More fun then," He said next to my ear in a raspy voice, letting the tip of his tongue make a path from my collarbone to under my jawline.I bit my lip, chuckling, noticing how my breathing was getting deeper and erratic. His other hand grabbed my hip as the hand in my stomach went down quickly, getting inside my trousers and my panties making me gasp and moan louder."Control yourself, darling," he smiled against my skin with the same tone. His hand caressed me right there in between my thighs and then he started to make slow circles in my clit as he continued kissing my neck. The temperature around us raised widely and his touch almost burnt me."Oh, Freddie..." I moaned in a whisper. Closing my eyes and then watching how his hand moved inside my clothes."I miss you so much, Lilith," he groaned, to then, bite my earlobe softly. "You can't imagine how badly I want to fuck you."Feeling his erection against my bum I chuckled again. Oh, I did imagine.I wanted to say how much I missed him as well, but Tonks' voice from the living room interrupted us, making us separate, against the devilish part of my conscious will."Lilith! Bring me a butterbeer as well, please!"I looked at Fred, breathing deep but quickly with his hands on his hips and looking pissed off right there where the voice came from and laughed walking to the fridge to grab another butterbeer. Fred did the same and we walked back to the living room as if nothing had happened.Everyone kept chatting for a bit, but now, I was just listening since my eyes every once in a while went back to Fred. He was sitting with his legs spread and his hands in the pockets of his black jeans, listening to Remus talk about one of the Marauders' adventures while also looking at me every five minutes. In one of the times, when he caught me biting my lip and covering his body from up to down, he smirked and ran his tongue, discreetly, by his upper lip, making me cross my legs tighter.He was provoking me."We should put some music!" Sirius shouted, smiling. Quickly, he grabbed the gramophone and put Gimme Gimme Gimme by Abba.Before I could even react, he dragged Tonks, Ginny, Hermione and me to stand up at the table and dance with him. He was so hyped up that all of us laughed and followed him."Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight!" he sang moving his hips in a small and messy circle made by us as Remus blushed smiling from his chair. Since Hermione was behind me I caught her arms and made her put them over my shoulders, moving my hips against hers, singing and hearing her chuckle.When I thought the boys were simply surprised, I noticed how someone pushed me slightly and softly and found George and Fred dragging Harry and Ron to steal our show."Now learn from the masters, amateurs," George teased and attempting to dance with a shocked Ron.We all laughed and I had to sit down to grab my belly and roar with laughter properly, making me almost spit the butterbeer.These Christmas were going really well after all...

Two days later, with Mr Weasley back at home, we were all completely relaxed, we got our Christmas presents; I managed to sneak to the city centre the day before to buy everyone their own gift - even for Mr and Mrs Weasley, to whom I left theirs anonymously, scared of their reaction if I had given it to them personally -, and sent Iris away with the ones meant for Pauline, Liv and Draco.I got some beautiful gifts too, which I kept carefully saved in my trunk, the most beautiful one was Tonks's handmade jumper for me which she did by imitating Mrs Weasley's ones, who even though she still avoided looking or talking to me, at least now when she did it, it didn't seem as if I was the worst evil walking this earth.Since the woman was still tired, the twins and Ronald decided to be the ones who prepared the Christmas dinner, but because they weren't precisely the most gifted chefs and Kreacher was locked, they asked me to help them. In one of the moments, Fred and George disappeared to get more ingredients, leaving Ron and me alone together, which at first was quite weird since I never talked to him but we ended up chatting a bit and it was quite good. He was way nicer than I had thought.The adults and the rest thanked us, and especially, I noticed Mrs Weasley's surprised and relieved look. While Harry, Sirius and Hermione cleaned the dishes after dinner, Remus went outside to wait for Liv, who asked to visit me a few days ago, while I had a little rest reading the letters Draco and Pauline sent me."The first living room, dear," I heard Remus whisper once the door opened."Thank you, Professor," Liv's voice sounded and I almost threw myself to run in her direction. I hugged her tightly, almost making the two of us fall, "Oh, you really missed me, huh?" she chuckled, trying to keep balance."Of course I did! How was France? How is Pauline?"Her eyes shined even more and her smile widened. "Amazing, every time I see her is even better than the previous one, she is so beautiful, Lilith. I can't believe someone can be that beautiful, and you should see her house... being there with her feels like a daydream.""Olivia Lovegood, right?" Sirius asked behind her, making Liv turn around smiling. "I heard a lot about you, welcome to my house. I already informed your dad you'll be staying here these next two days.""Thank you, Mr Black.""Bah! Call me Sirius, I'm not that old."I couldn't separate from Liv because of how excited I was about having her here with me. Even though Hermione and Ginny were really nice company, Liv will always be Liv.All of us accommodated in the living room, hanging out together and having a couple of butterbeer. Soon, Liv was completely included in the group, making me feel even more comfortable."You let Lilith drink vodka?! The last time she drank it we ended up in Wales-""Olivia!" I called her out, already laughing."You are never going to let me tell what happened in Wales, are you?""Never.""Anyway, I'm surprised you didn't get wasted, when was the last time you got a bit hammered? Was it in the Yule?" She chuckled."To be fair," George interrupted, "Everybody got hammered in the Yule Ball.""George Fabian Weasley!" His mum scowled, making the ginger shrug amused and his twin laugh. She snorted and left the room to keep an eye on Mr Weasley who was sleeping, followed by Sirius and Remus who apparently had something to talk about alone.Every once in a while, I noticed Fred kept looking at me with that desire shining in his eyes, sending tingles all over my body."Yes, we did." I laughed remembering that night. My eyes met Fred's for a brief moment and suddenly, our little argument that night and how I ended up getting turned on by him, making me touch myself thinking about him for the first time, popped off in my head. Wow, it looked like it had happened a long time ago..."I ended up kissing Pauline for the first time that night," Liv confessed, making me choke with my butterbeer."You did what?!""Yeah..." she whispered proudly."Why am I not surprised? You used to do the same when we went to the muggle clubs; you snogged someone and I found out days later... I don't like how this works.""You would've found out sooner if you didn't do the same thing you do every time; get so wasted you can't even walk." The blonde snickered, sticking out her tongue at me.I pretended to gasp offended. "No, I don't.""Of course you do. And we were lucky at Hogwarts, but in the muggle world I always had to save your ass," she continued making everyone in the room chuckle. "Do I have to remind you when you snogged that straight girl in the loo and I had to distract her boyfriend?""Her ex-boyfriend," I clarified. "And she wasn't that straight if I snogged her...""Touché," she laughed. "You know how weird the straights work, mate. I had to pretend to be one of them with that boy just to let you kiss his girlfriend, ew. You do owe me one after that.""I certainly do. I still don't know how you managed to distract him. Straights have they gay-dar broken.""You two realise you are surrounded by straights, right?" Fred smirked.Liv and I gave a discreet look at Hermione, who frowned her eyebrows at the ginger's comment."Are we?" Liv teased, with her typical sweet tone that disguised her bitchy comments. That's my best friend."Nah, you know I don't like labels, mate," George said, surprising me, smiling."Neither do I," Ginny continued, sitting on the table. If there was a Weasley who screamed not-straight energy, that was Ginny Weasley. I winked at her, proudly, and she smiled."Fair enough." Fred gave up, giggling. "And tell us, Olivia, did you and Arambella got yourselves in too many troubles with your muggle parties?""We knew how to get out of them more like. My dad gave us full freedom to do whatever we wanted as long we were sure about what we were doing and we came back home safe and sound. Luna loved to hear our stories once we were back."Ron snorted. "Mum would never let us do that.""Definitely not," the rest of the siblings said at the same time.Hours kept going by and everyone got even more comfortable, it felt like we were long life friends. The twins were sitting in the chairs with Ginny between them, still on the table. Ron and Harry were laying on the couch, while Liv, Hermione and I were together on the floor, with my head on Liv's lap and my legs on Hermione's. Later on, Sirius and Remus came back with hot cups of tea for all of us and Tonks showed up with a huge smile on her face, I immediately went to hug her and ended up laying in between her legs, with back against her chest while Liv played with the bracelet on my wrist.While Olivia was in a full conversation explaining to George how her Irish blood made her able to drink faster than the average person, my eyes flew right there were Lupin and Black were talking in whispers, looking at each other with puppy eyes. I felt my heart warming up."Remus is quite attractive, isn't he?" Tonks whispered in my ear, looking curiously at the man."Yeah, he is really good-looking and I think the scars give him an interesting look, don't they?" I took her hand in mine and started playing with her rings as she hugged my waist from behind. "Oi, by the way, are you still shagging that girl from Bristol? She was fit, mate.""Nah, she's a bit busy working at the Hospital. It's been more than two weeks since the last time I saw her. Might search someone else.""Fair enough, you can pull whoever you want, Dora."I heard her snickering and immediately, she started tickling me, making me laugh a bit too loud."You're gonna make me blush with such compliments, Lilith!""F-fuck off, T-tonks!" I managed to stutter, still laughing while I tried to writhe away from her attack. We both rolled on the floor, wrestling, me trying to escape from her tickling and her trying to make me laugh even more. I started tickling her as well and she almost spat the butterbeer in her mouth."NYMPHADORA!" We heard Mrs Weasley's voice, making us stop immediately. "For God's sake, you're a grown woman!"Sirius snorted and I saw how Lupin rolled his eyes."Let the girls have fun, Molly! They are not harming anyone!" Black protested, giving us an accomplice look.My eyes found Fred's when I noticed someone staring intensely at me. He had one of his eyebrows arched and his jaw clenched, even though he was trying to put a little smile on his face. I wondered why he was glaring at me like that when I clicked about how close Tonks and I actually were and how we were talking so low in whispers that unless it was Olivia, the one sitting next to us, no one could have known what were we talking about. Could it be possible that now, after being jealous of Draco, he was being jealous of Tonks? Merlin's balls, can't deny it turns me on to see him with such a claiming and dominant look.Liv seemed to read my thoughts because she discreetly slithered by Fred's side, giving him an innocent gaze that I knew was hiding her bitchy intentions. I pretended to be looking at George talking with Ron while I managed to listen to their conversation;"Are you jealous, Fred?" she murmured, with her soft and melodic tone.He snorted, amused, and rolled his eyes."Why would I? Last time I checked I'm the one fucking her," Fred whispered, pretty full of himself. "Besides, there's nothin' between us apart from friendship," his eyes met mine once again, challenging me, "is it?"I couldn't know if he was serious and he wasn't pissed off or if he really was miffed. Anyway, I gave him a quick gaze and he winked. Fuck, he knew the effect he had on me. He definitely knew.Liv chuckled and went back next to me."Are you jealous, Hermione? You know you are still my favourite confused girl, right?" I teased the brunette, making her fluster as she smiled."Oh, Merlin, Lilith!"Later, we got too tired to keep hanging out so went to sleep at midnight and I shared my bed with Liv, as we used to do at school and her home. It felt weird to be hugging her in my sleep and at the same time feeling Hermione in the bed right next to us, but I was incredibly comfortable with my two friends and I could have got used to it.✵ ✵ ✵A whole week passed and I got surprised - already in January when Liv had already gone, a few days before going back to Hogwarts, - with my uncle's visit.In the exact moment he set a foot in the Black House, Sirius's mood became pretty defensive and annoyed."I need to talk to you later," Severus said in a low mumble to me. Right before locking himself with Harry and Black in one of the offices."What do you think he wants to tell me?" I asked Remus while we had the afternoon tea together.The man sighed while putting a little bit of milk on his tea. " Honestly, I don't know, Lilith. You know how Sni-, I'm sorry, your uncle is. He shares his information only with Dumbledore.""Snivellus is a bit annoying, innit," I smiled at him, using the name he was about to say."Oh, Merlin," he chuckled. "I'm a bad influence on you.""You aren't," I snorted, a bit offended but still smiling at him. "More like you are the best influence by far.""Lilith," Snape's voice interrupted us, with his serious and annoyed expression, being followed by a deadpan Sirius, a concerned Mrs Weasley and the twins, who managed to sneak in before Snape closed the door behind him, leaving Harry out. "I have something to tell you.""I thought you wanted to talk alone.""No, unfortunately, this is the Order's concern as well," he mumbled, standing in front of me, a couple of steps away from Remus."But I'm not in the Order.""You need to know this.""You two can stay as long as you keep your mouths shut about what you hear here," Sirius warned the twins, who nodded fastly."What is it, Severus?" I asked, already impatient.He took a deep breath and avoided looking at me."Some Death Eaters have escaped from Azkaban," Snape whispered, but I heard it. Behind me, Molly Weasley hid a sob, the twins gasped and Remus passed his hands by his face, exhausted.I felt already my blood becoming ice and my breathing going erratic. No, it couldn't be possible."The ones who escaped were; Bellatrix Lestrange, I bet you know her. Augustus Rockwood, one of the Ministry spies for You-Know-Who, Antonin Dolohov, one of the Prewett brothers' murderers," my mother's henchman. I heard Mrs Weasley sobbing harder while the twins looked at each other, becoming paler.I knew Severus wasn't over."And?" I stuttered, nervous. Already knowing whose name he was going to mention."And Circe Snape," he finished, trying to make her sound distant from him.No, fucking hell no.The air became harder to breathe and I ran my hands by my face trying to wake up from this nightmare because it couldn't be real. It had to be a nightmare.She couldn't be out, she couldn't be free. My worst nightmare. My biggest fear. She had to be locked and as far away from me as possible."No," I whispered, noticing how my voice was leaving me. "Please, tell me that's not true.""Severus, are you completely sure of these names? Why does The Prophet haven't announced anything?" Remus asked, confused, walking to stay behind me, putting his hand on my shoulder in a comforting way. "Lilith, dear, make sure you take long and slow breathes, okay? You are going to be fine, don't worry.""I'm completely sure, Lupin. I wouldn't be putting my own niece near an anxiety crisis if I didn't know my information was correct." Severus hissed, staring disgustedly right there where Remus's hand was touching me. "The Prophet is waiting for the Ministry's order to post the news, they are trying to catch them soon before having to make the announcement to the Wizarding World. Fudge doesn't want to look as if Azkaban is not a safe place as it happened when Black escaped."Circe out of Azkaban. She was going to reach for her dearest Dark Lord, that was obvious, and she was going to gain power again because now that I wasn't in her way, nothing was going to stop her. She failed once, but she wouldn't fail twice."I'm telling you this, Lilith, because I know her. I know you do too. She will try to contact you, to take you with her and to make you one of them as she has always tried. You will have to be even more careful and have more protection from the Order.""Why would she want me? I'm the daughter of the man she hates the most in the world, she knows what I think about joining You-Know-Who and I haven't seen her since summer '91. I bet she would kill me if she had me in front of her."Snape shook his head, "Then you don't know your mother as well as I do. She wants you more than anything else in the world precisely because through destroying the Arambella part of you and making you an exact copy of her, she would feel she is destroying your father. Don't doubt you have been her biggest obsession these last years. Fudge even asked me to let you go back to visit her only to keep her calm because the Dementors barely affected her anymore.""Oh, fucking hell, no. I want her as far away from me as possible. I can't even - " my voice broke and I felt my eyes watering. She couldn't be out, she will find me. She will hurt all of them as in my nightmares."It's alright, dear, it's not your fault and you will not have to worry about it. You'll have the entire Order's protection as Harry and I promise you'll be fine, a'right?" Remus caressed my arm, trying to comfort me and normalizing my breathing a little bit. "Why don't you go to the rooftop to have a cig, relaxing with the cold breeze, huh?"I nodded and quickly stood up before everyone could see the tears threatening to leave my eyes."Wait, Lilith-""If you have anything to talk with her, Severus," Remus interrupted him with an authoritarian tone as I opened the door and started walking away. "You can say it to me."I ran upstairs as Remus said and opened the rooftop's door with a strong hit, with the tears already coming down my cheeks against my will and making my body feel cooler than usual because of the freezing dawn air.Of fucking course my good luck couldn't last too much. The good Christmas holidays, the laughter and the cosy moments and my mind giving me a break, couldn't last because she had to come and ruin it. As she always ruined everything in my life.Fuck, I need Liv right now.I went straight to the wall of the rooftop and lightened a cigarette. I wiped out my tears and focused on breathing deep and slow, she didn't deserve to have me weak or to fear her.She didn't deserve anything from me."Lilith," I heard a masculine voice calling, behind me. I cursed myself silently for knowing this soon too well whose voice was. I didn't turn around, thinking that would make Fred understand that I wanted to be alone.Were we in this weird truce? Yes. But I knew my mother and what she did to his family was one of the reasons - maybe even the biggest one - he had to hate me. And honestly, I could deal with many things, but not with his hate. Not anymore.His steps walking in my direction filled the almost silent atmosphere of the London night, he leaned on his back against the same wall where I was, looking at me.I tried to avoid his eyes by taking a long and nervous puff but it didn't work."Lilith, look at me."I did so. His eyes were serious and curious, but no hate in them, no despise, no mockery. He was straight unexpressive.Was he trying to hide how mad he actually was?

Instantly after looking at his eyes for a second, I drove back my sight to the empty streets and the view of the other buildings rooftops. I gave a short puff to my cigarette under his scrutinous eyes."I'm not going to become a Death Eater if that's why you came here, Fred."Damn it, I bet I was only ruining the moment. But I was incredibly nervous and barely could manage to hide how my hands were trembling."I didn't say so."It was a quick response, no doubt it in, but for some reason, I couldn't process it as the truth."But you thought it." Silence... I knew it. "Of course.""I'm not saying you are thinking about becoming one, Lilith. I just believe your mother could have a lot of influence on you, that's it. She's your mother after all."" I know who Circe is, Fred, you can guess it knowing my own mother is my worst nightmare. I'm not going to be influenced by her, why would I? She doesn't love me, you already heard Snape, she only wants to turn me into an even darker version of her. And-" my voice trembled and I bit my lip strongly to avoid crying. I hated myself for being this brutally honest with Fred. "You don't know how fucking hard and painful is having to embrace the Ares's characteristics in me, a man who didn't love me either, as my only way not to be just like her."He tightened his lips and looked, exhausted, at the view in front of us. I took the chance to wipe out one of the tears that threatened to leave my eyes."She has hurt you that much, hasn't she?"I nodded. "No one ever has hurt me as much as she has. He was the beginning of my pain, but she was the pain itself.""And you hate her," Fred guessed, looking at me with a bit of pity shining in his eyes. It looked as if he was joining the pieces of a puzzle."I do," I confirmed. "I'm not letting her turn me into one of them. I'm a half-blood, I'd literally be going against myself if I was one of them and I'm definitely not. I would be even able to sacrifice myself if that means she doesn't win."His eyes opened widely at those last words. It was the first time I admitted it aloud but if I had to give up on all my dreams and die for the cause, I would do it, and I'd make sure I drag that bitch with me to Hell."Oh Merlin, Lilith..." Fred ran his fingers through his hair and shook his head. "And I've been saying to you for all these years you were just like her..."The last thing I expected him to say was to remember how he messed with me using Circe, but I simply shrugged."You didn't know my opinion about her-""I knew she was your biggest fear," he interrupted me, trying to stop me from excusing him."Yeah, so did all the Gryffindors in your course who still messed with me, you weren't the only one. Besides, I also fucked you up a lot, and we both know you only messed with me because I was a better Beater than you." I chuckled, trying to downplay.He slightly smiled. "Aha, in your dreams, maybe. I'm still the one who hits harder of the two of us."I punched him in the arm and he snickered. Then, without any other word needed, we went back down again, and because I wasn't feeling like seeing anyone else, I said 'good night' to Fred and got in my dorm just to lay in Hermione's bed before she arrived, hoping she would let me sleep with her tonight.✵ ✵ ✵Going on the train back to Hogwarts, I couldn't help but tell Liv what happened, even though the news weren't yet public on the Prophet. She got even paler and asked me how I was feeling three times in a row, taking my hands between her warm ones. I told her I was okay because I didn't want to worry her after the incredible holidays she had with Pauline and because I had all these last days to interiorise it, crying on Hermione's shoulder, who surprised me by being incredibly supportive and understanding.On the other hand, Draco didn't talk to me. He was incredibly distant and even though he gave me a quick smile, trying to play it cool as if he could fool me. I was aware that he had to know about his aunt escaping and he was so into Umbridge's weird vigilance group that his dark side was rising more than ever. I wanted to run at him and talk to him- maybe slap him- to knock some sense in his little stubborn and snob mind. I didn't even want to think about what could happen to our friendship if he ever chooses to stand with his father's side, with the Death Eaters.I couldn't do anything more to help him and I couldn't give my mother the satisfaction to be occupying all my mind, so I forced myself to stop thinking about her."Fred apologised about what he did to you in the past?!" Liv asked, surprised."He didn't apologise, Liv. He acknowledged it, that's it.""Better than nothing, I suppose," she replied a bit disappointed. "Step by step.""Step in what?""In confessing he likes you.""He fucked me, Liv, modestly, it's obvious that he likes me.""No, but I mean properly like. In a romantic way."I snorted louder than I intended. "You've got to be joking!" a burst of laughter escaped from my mouth, "Of course he doesn't, Olivia.""He does, Lilith. I know he does.""He didn't speak to me again since that encounter on the rooftop, for fuck's sake. I don't know too much about romance but that doesn't sound like it, does it? ""Because I bet he's still trying to process his own feelings. C'mon, mate, don't tell me it isn't suspicious; he is the only Weasley who acted the maggot with you, the rest did it but he took it a bit too personal when he was a wee snot, and now that he's maturing - as much as Fred Weasley can mature - he's sexually attracted to you and even tries to behave like a normal human being.""Bah!""Think about it! Men are weird as fuck, I wouldn't be surprised if all that bullshit during those years was only a pure excuse to hate himself for liking you.""You read too many muggle novels, mate," I replied, chuckling, but inside, Olivia's words rooted in my mind.When we finally got to school, we found out Umbridge put some new dumb and useless decrees and that the DA would have it even harder to reunite again. Fucking shit, that bitch was ruining my last year at school.The next day, after classes, having lunch with Blaise and a pretty somewhere-else Draco at the Slytherin table and walking with Liv near Professor Hagrid's cabin to catch some fresh air and silence, I decided to watch the Slytherin Quidditch training just to torture myself a little bit because, why not?I stood up in front of the seats, observing how the unbearable Umbridge bitch was arguing with Madame Hooch. Ignoring them, I wondered how the new Beater, Goyle, managed to get inside the team. Bloody hell, he was one of the worst ones I've ever seen, we were going to lose the fucking cup again.Feeling kinda miserable about not being able to play Quidditch or even to fly on my broom, I heard a high-pitched and annoyingly familiar coughing behind me. Against my will, I forced myself to turn around and give Umbridge my most unexpressive face."Yes, Professor?"She had her stereotypical fake smile on her face but I could feel how her blue eyes were judging me."Miss Arambella, I think you should be aware that the dress code in my school " her- what? I restrained myself from scowling " doesn't allow young ladies to wear your uniform skirts as short as you are wearing yours. I'm terribly sorry but I'd see myself forced to punish you if I see you dressed like a shameless prostitute again."Come again? Did she just call me a cheeky whore just because my skirt is a bunch of centimetres up above my knees? Oh, how fucking appropriate for the Inquisitor of a school..."I will leave to give you some privacy to put your clothes correctly whether you want to do it with magic or in the muggle way," she continued saying the word muggle with quite a disgusted tone. "If I see you again like that, don't doubt you will be punished."Oh, come on, you fucking pain in the ass, why don't you punish me now? Are you getting softer?As she walked away, I lifted my two middle fingers at her back. Ugh, that woman really pissed me off with the littlest thing. Walking away from the Quidditch field, with both Umbridge's and Olivia's words in my mind, I got a great idea that could perfectly fuck up the old bitch and at the same time guarantee me some fun.Getting back into the Dungeons and straight to my room. I took off my uniform skirt and searched through my whole wardrobe for a more appropriate one. Quickly, I found one of my favourite skirts, the one that glued to my body like a second skin and it was way shorter than the one from the uniform, finishing right below my bum, making really risky any movement. I took off as well the ugly grey uniform cardigan we had to wear on cold days and stayed in my shirt, my tie and the skirt. I smiled at myself in the mirror, fixing my hair.As soon as I got out of the common room, some looks ended on upon me; they knew I was playing fire with Umbridge. Making sure that enough students saw me so they could snitch at Umbridge, I made my way to one of the empty Gardens where Fred used to smoke alone."Oi, Arambella! Embracing the inner whore in you?" A Gryff boy shouted, gaining to be slightly pushed by an angry Angelina, but it didn't make him stop his next words. "How much do I have to pay you to let me hit from behind?"With an arrogant and bitchy smile, I took my wand off my boot and pointed at him."Not even being a million dollar man, honey." I ironized playing with my wand between my hands.Silently, I pronounced the word 'Expulso' in my head and the boy flew straight to the wall with a little blue light in front of him since my silent magic wasn't strong enough."She just used silent magic to curse me!" he protested trying to stand up."Did she?" Angelina questioned ironic, looking at me with a smile. I winked at her "I haven't seen anything, have you, Katie?""Nothing." the mentioned said. "You, Alicia?""Not at all. Oi, Ginny, did ya?""Nah, Lilith didn't do anything." the ginger grinned at me.I thanked them silently with a wide smile and another wink and continued my direction. I found Fred sitting in one of the rocky benches, legs spread, shirt kinda unbuttoned, red tie and messy hair, with the cig hanging from his lips. When I noticed the rough expression on his face as he stared at someone by his side, I hid behind one of the trees, discreetly, still observing the situation. The other person came closer and I identified her as Sienna Plums, who after saying something to Fred, she attempted to touch his face but he moved a bit, making her walk away in my left direction, kinda annoyed. I managed to not be seen by her.Finding him alone with her here while looking that good as he was doing, made a little flame burn in my guts even though he clearly rejected her. When I made sure Fred was alone, I slowly revealed myself, slightly smirking, and watching him stare at the grass."Hello, Freddie..." I murmured, playfully, trying to catch his attention."Oh, hey Lilith-" he interrupted himself when he lifted his eyes and saw me standing right there, legs crossed and arms behind my back, making my shirt tighter and more shape-revealing. His eyebrows raised, and his brown and bright eyes covered me from up to down. "Wow."I gave him a feline smile, "I was wondering... if you wouldn't mind sharing a cig with me." I asked as I walked slowly in his direction.Fred's eyes focused on my skirt and he trapped his lower lip between his teeth and let it free. "I know that skirt, the one that made the truce so difficult for me... Damn it, Lilith, you love playing with me, don't you?""I'm not playing." I faked my innocent tone, sitting on his lap and crossing my legs. "I just wanted a cig to distress from Umbridge.""Can't blame you then," Fred said with a controlled tone, staring at my lips, with that smirk characteristic of him, and caressing my hip while he took the cigarette to his lips again. "And you came straight to me? How pretty."I nodded and he chuckled, starting to bounce the leg where he had me sitting, making me already feel pressure inside my underwear. I can play too, darling. I started to slowly, almost imperceptibly, grind against him, making him arch his eyebrows and have his eyes going darker."I was pissed off. She called me a whore.""Oh, did she?""Not with those words, but yeah, that's what she meant." My eyes fell to his lips and I moved my face closer to his. "She said I was a shameless prostitute for wearing my uniform skirt too short for the dress code, so I went to my room and changed it into a shorter skirt."He snickered in that raspy and deep voice, making me feel wet and even more tempted. "What a fucking bitch that woman...""Aha, the only time where I liked being called whore is when you fuck me, Freddie," I whispered, making him take a long and deep breath."Fucking hell, Lilith...""Also, it wasn't that short," I continued, "You couldn't see my underwear, now you can if uncross my legs, look." I did so, showing him that precisely, I was wearing the lingerie he bought me.Fred licked his lower lip, with that smile still on his face and slightly narrowed his eyes to look back at me. "I knew that would look bloody good on you..." he squeezed my hip in his hand and caressed my bum while leaving a slow kiss on my neck."It would look better on your room's floor.""Fuck, are you that horny, darling?" he teased me, leaving my neck to look at me straight in the eye with those piercing brown eyes. "Because, believe me, there's nothing right now I want more than fucking you. You can't believe how much I miss you...""I miss you too, Freddie. I really miss you fucking me hard again." I whispered against his lips, making the movements of my hips more obvious. He breathed deeply again and throwing the fag-end away without looking at where, he put his free hand in my neck making me instantly moan, and kissed me fiercely.His lips again on mine felt heavenly, our tongues playing and the heat coming from him turning me on even more. Wanting to provoke Fred, I drove my hands to his hair and slowly caressed it, while I mouthed in my mind the word Impedimenta.Immediately, Fred got a bit uncomfortable in the kiss noticing he could barely move. I separated from him with a mischievous smile on my face. He looked confused and amused at the same time."Silent magic? What are you doing, Lilith?" he asked with a smile on his face, trying to read my mind.I bit his lower lip and grinned arrogantly."I want you to fuck me, Freddie, but I also love playing with you." I kissed his lips pretty briefly and stood up, walking away quickly, knowing he wouldn't be able to follow me because of the silent spell.He had a big smile on his face and eyes full of wild desire."Oh, darling, you will be paying for this once I'm able to move.""That's the whole point " I winked at him, going back to walk away and once in the corridor, running to the common room and my dorm.I was planning to sneak to his dorm in the night, drag him out of Georgie and Lee's sights and end up fucking him probably in the empty loo.But first, without even taking off my clothes, I fell asleep for the rest of the afternoon.I genuinely needed a nap.

A soft and slow caress in my thigh woke me up. It was already dawn and I could barely see in the dark. At first, I thought it might have been Draco but that wasn't his way to wake me up at all so it made me suspect and turn on the dimly light in my dorm pretty quickly.I found Fred staring at me, standing at the end of my bed, smirking, with his hands in the pockets of his uniform trousers and the fierceness shining in his eyes."You thought I was going to let this pass?" he hissed slowly, like a sweet poison."How did you know the password of the common room?" I asked, honestly surprised. Apart from Liv, no other non-Slytherin knew it."Obviously it had to be 'Pureblood', I'm not stupid," he grinned, running his fingers by his hair.He definitely wasn't. Under his piercing look and keeping eye contact, I stood up from my bed and got in front of him, challenging."You don't share your dorm and your bed it's pretty big, that's going to make things easier for us," he whispered, looking at my lips."How did you find my room?" I asked, trying to play it cool even though I could feel my body craving in anticipation.He snickered proudly, "You could say I threatened Malfoy. I told him I had to give you something and when he refused to tell me, I reminded him I haven't forgotten about the Quidditch incident. Good for me that your common room was empty except for him. I don't want to give explanations to the Slytherins.""And what do you have to give me, Freddie?" I teased him, lowering my head slowly and biting my lower lip.Fred started to unbutton his shirt real quick, with his eyes on mine, leaving his tie on my bed."You already know, Lilith. You got me sitting there alone for two hours, darling, and I got off cigs because of it. Told you I'd make you pay for it, didn't I?"He passed his hand around my waist and glued me to his body, rubbing his nose with mine."First of all, do you want this? We aren't doing anything you don't want, darling.""I do," I guaranteed him, firmly."If I hurt you or you regret it, tell me to stop immediately, clear? I need both of us to enjoy it."I nodded again with the tingles accumulating in between my legs and I shortened the distance between us, catching his lips with mine in a slow and burning kiss. Taking my hand to his hair, Fred started walking, making me walk backwards to keep the kiss, and took his hands to caress my bum. I ended up pinned against my dressing table. The fire-like light coming from my lamp and the candles in my room along with my walls covered in dark green motifs, most of them Quidditch related, created a sensual and intimate space.Fred broke the kiss, with swollen lips and mischievous eyes, and smiled arrogantly. He turned me around to look at him through my mirror."Want me to touch you, Lilith?" he whispered in my ear, grabbing my hips and glueing his body to mine. I nodded, keeping eye contact with him through the glass.One of his hands went straight to my neck, causing me to gasp as he made me tilt my head to give him more access to kiss the exposed skin from my collarbone to behind my ear. Watching his movements and how much control he was having on my body, I moved my hips slowly to make sure my bum was moving against his erection, which was pretty obvious through the thin fabric of his trousers."You love to provoke me, don't you?" he murmured, breathing heavily."I fucking adore it, Freddie," I smiled giving him a feline look through the mirror, as his hand in my hip went straight to my thigh.Thanks to the mirror, I got a full view of how he let it go up and quickly got inside my underwear. His only touch made me already pant low and crave him. He gave me a slow complete caress, stroking my pussy, and then started to draw circles in my clit while with his other hand gripping my neck as he left lovebites in it."You're already so wet, darling. Such a desperate slut for me...""Freddie...""Mmmh?" his kisses burnt me and his touch was driving me crazy.One of my hands was in his arm and the other one, in his hair, trying to hold me and not melt right there."Fuck me."He chuckled with that raspy voice making me tremble, taking both his hands to the start of my shirt, unbuttoning it as fast as he did with his."Oh, darling, I've been wanting to fuck you in this skirt since the very first moment I saw you wearing it on that rooftop, I'm not losing the chance to do it now." Once my shirt and tie were off, he took off my bra and his hands went straight to my breasts, cupping them while continuing with his slow kisses. "It took all the self-control in me not to fuck you rough that night right there.""Fuck, Fred." I couldn't help but moan softly, going straight to his lips to melt into a wild and passionate kiss. I took my hands to his trousers to unbutton them because I couldn't hold myself anymore, and he put them down along with his boxers without thinking twice.I was about to put down my skirt as well, but he stopped me."Ah-ah" he shook his head, playfully, looking at me through the mirror, taking his hands under it to grab my underwear and put it down. He lifted my skirt and made me bend a little bit against the wood of my dressing table.I observed how he caressed my hips and my inner thighs, biting his lip while smiling, admiring my body. He grabbed his dick and rubbed it from my entrance to my clit, making me hold a moan."You are almost dripping, Lilith..." Fred groaned, scoffing proudly."Are going to stop drooling and fuck me already or do I have to do it myself?" I teased him, making him raise his eyes and made straight eye contact with me, smirking."Don't forget who has the control here," he tempted, snickering, already positioning his tip in my entrance. My body whooped silently in anticipation, wanting him inside right now. "I want you to keep your eyes in the mirror, darling. I want you to look at how I fuck you so you don't forget who turns you into this little pretty mess you are, understood?"I wanted to protest but the authority in his voice turned me on so much I ended up nodding, still smiling.He grabbed my hips and pushed himself inside me in just one hard thrust, making us moan at the same time. He stopped to let me get used to his size and slowly moved, with his eyes fixed right there where our bodies were connecting."Fuck, Lilith - feels so fucking good..." Fred whispered, breathing deeply. He went deeper inside of me, still slowly to let us feel each other completely. Damn, I genuinely had missed him. "I missed this so fucking much."Feeling even more turned on by the sound of his hips collapsing against my bum, and looking literally like a bloody Greek god, he started to go deeper, making me feel him even better."Freddie..." I moaned with a raspy voice, meeting his eyes through the mirror. I passed my tongue through my lips, provoking him even more. He groaned, digging his hand more in my hips and doing faster and deeper thrusts."Louder, darling. Moan my name louder so everyone in Slytherin knows who is fucking you this good."A little whimper escaped from my lips and the temperature in the room felt almost unbearable. I clenched around him intentionally, gaining a loud and raspy moan from him and whispering 'fuck', concentrating the tingles in between my legs even more."Want me going rougher, Lilith?" he teased me, to then pass the tip of his tongue through my neck to my jawline."Y-yes, Freddie, please," I trembled, feeling out of voice. He smiled devilishly and one of his hands left my hips to go straight to my neck and put pressure, making my head rest on his shoulder. He slowed down the rhythm to let me feel how big he was and how deep he was actually going, panting in my ear to then go immediately for faster and rougher thrusts, filling the air with the sound of his hips crashing against my skin and our synchronised moans and groans.The mixture of pain and pleasure was the sweetest I ever tried, his voice and the sound of his erratic breathing was melting me and making me feel so powerful knowing the effect I had on him. He went back to kissing my neck and my jaw as the pressure in between my legs was almost unbearable. The goosebumps hit me hard once he moved his other hand to my swollen clit, I couldn't stop the trembling in my legs and a hoarse cry that left my mouth, feeling my throat already sore.The rollercoaster in my guts got harder and I could feel myself clenching against him again as my moans became louder, he smiled proudly and moved his hands back to my hips to thrust hard."Look at yourself," he whispered with an out-of-breath voice that made him even more attractive. "Fucking gorgeous, and all for me...""Freddie...I'm a-about to -cum." My own moan interrupted me when I felt how he hit my weakest spot."Then cum, darling. Cum for me."My legs trembled even more and I felt my juices going down my legs, making me tighter around Fred, who moaned as well, as I became a whole mess in his arms with his name in my lips, in front of that bloody mirror that gave him a full view of the effect he had on me."Such a good girl," he smiled, slowing his thrust as he was finishing as well. He tilted his head back, closing his eyes with his mouth opened widely and filling me. "Oh, Lilith..."We both looked at each other through the cristal and smiled. I stretched making him get out of me and turned around to face him, but when I was about to stand up normally, my legs failed me. Luckily, Fred trapped me before I could fall and pinned me against the dressing table again."You better erase that arrogant smile from your face before I do," I threatened him, jokingly."Did I fuck you so hard now you can't walk, Lilith?" he teased."Fuck off." I showed him my middle finger, with a sarcastic smile.He looked at me from up to down and bit his lip while narrowing his eyes."On the bed. Now." Fred ordered, driving his eyes back to mine."Excuse me?" I raised an eyebrow."You heard me. I'm still not done with you."Damn."If you are going to be the dominant again then I want some advantage."He imitated my gesture, without erasing the slight smile."Which one?""Take three of the sweets you gave me for my birthday. I want to have the same effect on you that you had on me." I said opening one of my drawers behind me and shaking the bag in front of him."Deal, but you have to let me have full control over you," Fred replied, taking three of the sweets and quickly making them fly in the air to let them fall into his mouth."Fine, you can even tie me up with your tie if you want to," I smirked, joking... kind of.He opened his eyes widely and his smile grew, looking at me like a hungry wild animal who just caught me in its trap."On the bed, Lilith."I obeyed but moved painfully slowly, letting myself fall in the soft white sheets of my bed, leaning down and spreading my legs in front of him with a teasing smirk on my face. He covered me from up to down again. I loved how he always looked at me as if it was the first time he saw me naked and wanted to keep that moment carved in his memory.Fred got on my bed, in between my legs and rubbed his nose with mine in a sweet gesture, to then kiss me slowly and softly."Fuck, I'm going to enjoy this so bloody much," he snickered against my lips."What's going on, Freddie? It's it already affecting you?" I teased him, interrupting myself with my own gasp when he introduced two of his fingers inside me, keeping eye contact with me in such an intimate way that it felt he was already fucking me again."Don't need any sweet to work. You are the one having the effect on me."I chuckle at his words, to then bite his lower lip and start kissing the path from his jawline to his neck and his collarbone. His skin was so hot at the touch of my tongue that I put my hands in his hair to pull him closer to me and start kissing and sucking his neck, he moaned and I felt him already hard again."Fuck it, I can't take it anymore," Fred complained, taking his fingers off me and slightly separating. "Hands against the headboard, darling."I obeyed challenging him with my arrogant smile, he picked his tie and did a good knot around my wrists, glueing them to the headboard tightly, and keeping intimate eye contact. He was enjoying this."Uh, we're going rough, aren't we?" I joked, noticing I was unable to move my hands."Always, Lilith" Fred smiled, caressing my hips to then spread more my legs as his eyes focused on the tie around my hands. He grinned mischievously, his stare going back to my body and then back to my eyes. "Gryffindor looks good on you, darling.""Oh, shut up and fuck me already," I laughed. "And Slytherin would have looked way cuter on me. Now, come here." I lowered my voice, commanding him.He tilted his head to the left, with an incredulous smile and narrowed eyes, but he obeyed.With our faces closer and feeling him trying to accommodate in my entrance, he murmured; "I thought I told you I'm the one in control here.""Don't get too excited about it," I replied trying to sound convinced and firm, but his mouth decided to give brief attention to my breasts and nipples, making me pant."I'm not the one tied up..." he scoffed, going back to my face."Fred, if you don't shut up I-" my own loud and high-pitched moan interrupted my words when he pushed himself inside again, this time slower than before, with that arrogant smirk.His mouth opened in a drown and hoarse moan once he felt me under the effect of the sweets."Fuuuuck..." he whispered, sighing hard and hissing. "How can you feel this damn good?""Mmmh, the sweets, Freddie...""Fuck the sweets, it's you. Of fucking course it's you." he groaned, lowering himself to kiss my jaw and start thrusting slightly faster.He caught my legs and made me surround his hips so he could go deeper, to then move one of his hands to surround my waist while the other one kept caressing and grabbing my leg. His kisses went down to my breasts and my collarbones."Freddie..." I moaned, trying to move my hands from the tie at the urgent feeling to caress him as well. Fuck. He smiled, more turned on, and with his eyes darker, he lifted himself to grip my neck and whisper against my lips."I fucking love it when you moan my name."I tilted my head back, letting it rest in my pillow, and closing hard my eyes when he started to hit faster and rougher, groaning raspy against my skin and making me whimper of pure pleasure.His other hand dug again in my hip and the one in my neck moved to put more pressure on my wrists."Such a good girl- letting me fuck you hard."I sighed, choking with emotion, when he trapped my lower lip between his teeth, listening to his erratic breathing and the sound of his hips crashing against mine now deeper and harder than before.I felt him in every inch of my body, melting with his skin and his touch, being completely at his mercy. I couldn't help but close my eyes again when he moved his hand in my hip to caress my clit with his thumb as his thrusts kept their roughness."Don't close your eyes, Lilith, look at me while I fuck you," he whispered, caressing softly and gently my cheek with his free hand.I did so and I found his brown eyes almost black, shining in desire and craving to make me his. Damn it, Freddie."Fuck," I gasped, barely able to catch air as the pressure in between my legs kept harder and hotter.A loud and raspy whine escaped from his lips against mine when I clenched intentionally around him. "Fucking hell, you are going to be the death of me, woman." he whimpered, feeling overwhelmed by the effect the candies were having on him.With a groan, his hand went back to my neck, making me smile."My perfect whore..." he whispered in my ear.I opened my mouth and stuck out my tongue, Fred smirked knowing my intentions and spit right there to then kiss me passionately and messy."Only when you say it..." I whispered back, to then bite his lower lip again, making him pant and moan lower and hoarse.He lifted himself, with his eyes fixed on how rough he was going in and out of me. Smiling, in really quick movements, he cupped my bum and lifted my hips, staying on his knees and getting even deeper."Fuck..." we both moaned at the same time, feeling the new sensation.Bloody hell, this man was going to end with me.The sound of our bodies crashing against each other and the soft whines and moans escaping from our lips along with the sensitiveness of my skin at being so exposed because of my tied hands, drove me to my limit and I got again to the highest peak of my climax. I felt myself tightening around Fred, who replied with another hoarse and out of breath moan, keeping fast and rough his thrusts as he felt I was coming."That's it, love. Such a good slut coming around me.""Fred!" I couldn't help but moan out loud his name as he hit my weakest spot again. I felt like going up the rollercoaster as he was also close to finishing too.My legs trembled and my body found it difficult to catch the air back, Fred lowered himself to kiss me and drown his last moans in my lips."Fuck, Lilith! " he whispered, with his erratic breathing and broken voice, giving a last and deep thrust, coming inside of me, letting me feel him till his last drop.I gave him a quick kiss, and snickered with my lower voice, tempting."Good boy, Freddie..."His smile grew as he took a deep and long breath.Fred got out of me and caressing my hips and my legs, he left soft and slow kisses in the corners of my mouth and my cheeks as his hands went up till they reached my tied wrists to free them."You were fucking amazing, darling."I smiled proudly while he made us sit properly and started massaging my bruised wrists."You were pretty....good too," I teased him, looking at the corner of my room dramatically as if I was running from his eyes."Only good?" Fred tickled me, with his eyebrows raised and that amused smile on his face."Okay, okay... let's leave it in amazing too," I replied out of breath, pretending that I only said it to keep him happy.He giggled and I thanked him internally that he understood my kind of humour."Do you mind if I wait here a little bit until midnight so I can sneak back to my dorm?" Fred asked once we calmed."No problem, just let me get my clothes," I moved to the edge of my bed, as he laid on it, with one of his hands behind his head, using it as a pillow, the other one resting on his abdomen and a leg bent with the white sheet casually only covering very dimly his hips."Oh, come on, don't ruin me the view," Fred protested, making the flame in my guts grow and the devilish part of my mind roar of pure arrogance."I'm cold, Fred!" I replied, about to stand up. I noticed my legs were still weak and trembling but I had trust in them to hold me and let me walk.Bad idea, the bitches failed me.As soon as I tried to stand up and give one step, I fell to the floor."Fucking shit!"Fred burst into laughter behind me."I told you, darling. After how hard I fucked you today, you won't be walking in a little while," he claimed very proudly of himself, letting out a long sigh. "Now, come here and let me warm you."I snorted kinda annoyed because no one ever made me not be able to walk after sex. Struggling and under Fred's amused look, I got back to my bed and when I was about to throw my sheet over my exhausted body, Fred stopped me and put the fabric down, then pulled me closer to his body, hugging me. His skin was almost burning, as usual, so my body got warmer soon, as one of his hands caressed my back and one of my legs rested over his.I could get used to this...

"You know you are the third student who's not a Slytherin, and probably the first Gryffindor, entering our common room?" I said after a while, moving from him to give him some space."Well, I bet old pal Salazar wouldn't like to know a Gryff shagged under his roof, would he?" Fred joked, standing up from bed to put on his black boxers and wander around my room."I dunno, incredible how it sounds, I've never met him. But, yeah, I don't think he would.""I have to admit it is way cooler and nicer than I thought. That huge glass wall with views to the water was really stunning... but come again, how did you end up not sharing your room?" he asked, making me sigh. "Privileges of being a professor's relative?"I wish... but no, the nightmares- Severus thought it wouldn't be a good idea to have any other 11-year-old being waken up at midnight with my screams."He opened his eyes widely, so I tried to play down."But it's by far the best thing in the world, I can do whatever I want in here.""Mmmh, I wonder what sort of things you have done in here..." he smirked, "I love sharing a dorm with Georgie and Lee but sometimes the lack of privacy is exhausting."I tried to stand up but my legs were trembling too much. I snorted, already regretting the words that were about to leave my mouth:"Would you mind helping me to stand up? I want to put on my panties."He snickered but came pretty quick in front of me to grab my hands and help me."You better take off that cocky smile out of your face before I do," I warned him, trying to hold back my own smile."Threaten me once you can walk by yourself, Lilith."I rolled my eyes while Fred grabbed my hips to make me sit on my dressing table so my legs could rest. When I thought he was going to separate a little bit, he got closer, getting in between my legs with his hands on the wood and his face close to mine."I haven't done here as much as you think I have," I said after a while, keeping eye contact."No? I would if I were you.""Well, if you mean by myself... then, yes." His eyebrows raised and a seductive little smile appeared on his face."Any time thinking about me?"I nodded slowly and Fred took a deep breath, lowering his eyes to my lips."If only I could see that spectacle..."You could if you want to."The first time was last year," I continued, playing with him because I could never have enough of it. "After the Yule Ball... Even though I still wanted to kill you, I couldn't help but feel so turned on by you.""It happened the same to me."I snorted, ironic, and laughed, "Yeah, I bet it did.""I'm being serious! The exact moment I saw you with that red dress, showing off this beautiful body... Fuck." Fred took another deep breath and his voice became deeper. "I wanted to slam you against the wall, yes, but I also wanted to rip your dress off and fuck you right there in front of everyone. When I saw you dancing with Olivia and later with Malfoy... and Pauline kissing you in front of me, damn, I wanted so badly to be her. I could only think about getting in between these pretty legs and show you no one would ever please you as I could."I sighed hard, processing his words and trying to ignore the growing tingles under my panties."And you still left with Plums." I hissed, smirking at him.He burst into raspy and deep laughter. "Nothing happened with her. I couldn't... I snogged her a couple of times and then asked her to leave - she left quite pissed off, especially after what I said during the kiss... but, darling, I had you so deeply rooted in my mind that I had to wank on my own, thinking about you.""How romantic." I joked, putting my hands on my knees to have my face closer to his."But now that I know you did the same," Fred continued, ignoring my comment. "My ego is even bigger than before.""Ugh, for Merlin's sake, no, please," I joked, making him chuckle. He lowered himself and kissed my shoulder to start making a path of slow kisses from my collarbones to my neck and then to my other shoulder, I tilted my head back to let him, closing my eyes and with a big smile on my face. "I shouldn't have told you anything then.""Oh, good for me you did, darling. I'm going to sleep with the image of you moaning my name and touching yourself," he murmured against my skin. " What a pity I'd have to use my imagination, though."I snickered and Fred passed one of his hands around my waist and then, looked at me straight to my eyes to then lower his sight to my body and smile proudly."Beautiful..." he whispered, caressing one of the lovebites in my neck.I bit his lower lip, making him smile."How are your wrists? Did I hurt you?" he asked, looking pretty serious for the first time since he got in the room."They are fine.""And the bruises in your hips?""Fred, I'm okay, don't worry." I guaranteed him, being actually surprised about him worrying like this."Great," His smile grew, and then separated a bit from me. "I would love to stay more but it's already midnight and if I'm not back at the Gryffindor tower before dawn you and me will have to give too many explanations."I agreed and stood up, feeling my legs kinda firmer. At least firm enough to hold me. We dressed at the same time and while I was tying up my tangled hair, Fred was glancing at the stuff on my dressing table."How many silver rings do you have?!" he asked, genuinely surprised looking at the little box full of them."Too many to know it," I replied honestly. They were my favourite items and between the family ones and the ones I bought on my own, I had a good collection of them."These three are really beautiful." Fred admired them; one of them had a scarlet red stone in it, the other one was pretty simple, with just two decorative lines, and the last one had a sun carved on top of it. He left the rest with the box over the dressing table while still admiring the ones in his hand."Take them.""What?" he asked, surprised."I barely wore them, I prefer the ones I'm wearing at the moment, you can have them.""Lilith, no...""It's a gift, Fred.""No, they are yours," he sounded pretty serious."Yes, and I'm giving them to you so now they are yours.""Why would you?""Because I want to," I stated pretty solid. Looking that he wasn't still convinced, I approach him and softened my tone. "You gave me more than one gift so I want to do it too.""Yeah, but I enjoyed one of those gifts too." Fred continued, still talking back, referring to the candies."That's what gifts are for, to enjoy them. Now, shut up and take the rings." I looked at his lips and whispered. "Imagine how good would they look in your hands when you choke me."That seemed to be enough for him because his facial expression relaxed being substituted for a mischievous smile."Fair enough."He put them on and admired his own hands, being as happy as a little kid."Come on, I will walk with you to the common room door before you get lost."We got out of my room and went down the stairs to end up in the main living room. Fred's eyes shined as discreetly as he could while his look covered every place in the common room. He probably thought the Slytherin room would be a dark and humid place or a terribly posh and frivolous one, but instead, it was a cosy and elegant one with candles and dark green decoration in addition to the Romantic vibe around it thanks to years going by and the redecorations it had.For a moment, I thought we were alone, but Draco's platinum hair illuminated by the fireplace in front of him as he rested in one of the couches indicated otherwise. Apparently, he was drinking one of his apple juices while reading.Fred raised one of his eyebrows and I approached the Malfoy boy carefully."Draco?"The boy moved, standing up surprised, and when his eyes met mine, he blushed."What are you doing here?""I could ask you the same.""I asked first.""Draco..." I warned him, and he sighed."I couldn't sleep.""How long have you been here?"He blushed even harder. Shit, that wasn't good."Long enough... to hear you two." He murmured, with his eyes on his foot."Oh, fuck my life." I cursed, grabbing my nasal bridge with my index and my thumb, putting my other hand in my hip."You know, I'm more traumatized now than when you shagged Cedric." Draco continued with his eyes opened widely and fixed on the wall behind me. "It hurts me as fuck to say it but the point goes for Weasley."I heard how Fred snorted, amused, and I turned around to give him a shut-up look. He smiled at me, arrogantly, standing right behind me and with his arms crossed in front of his chest.Someone kill me. I don't care anymore."You could have left, Draco.""Blaise locked the door before I could get in," he complained, making a childish pout. " He is shagging Pansy."What the fuck?... Nevermind, I don't want to know."Guess Slytherin isn't that boring after all..." Fred whispered."Shut up, carrot." Draco hissed at the ginger, in an outburst of confidence and annoyance mixed."Then you should do the same, mate. Go get fucked by your Potter." I mumbled."Lilith!" the blonde complained again and clicked his tongue. "He is still mad at me. I'd probably talk tomorrow with Daphne, heard she has a pretty sister.""That's good.""Wait... Malfoy, you are gay?" Fred asked, confused. He didn't sound judgy but genuinely surprised.Draco scowled, running his fingers through his hair. That was the question the entire Slytherin house had but no one dared to mouth, not even me. Draco's sexuality was only Draco's business."I'm not gay, you blood traitor Weasley!" Draco raised his voice, almost spitting to Fred, to then go back to his normal tone as if he was considering his words. "I'm just confused and with no labels.""And you have stayed here alone all this time?" I questioned changing the topic. Draco's eyes relaxed when they got back to me.He nodded. "Yeah, but some merpeople appeared behind the glass and I had a chat with them.""How so?" Fred asked again, now more confused than before."Sign language." Draco and I replied at the same time, Draco's tone more obvious and annoyed than mine, of course.We, the Slytherin kids, sometimes felt so lonely even in our own house that we all ended up learning how to communicate with the merpeople. They were actually really nice once you get to meet them.One of the doors in the corridors upstairs opened and seconds after, we saw Pansy running silently, with her clothes put on messy, to the girls' rooms' corridor. Fortunately, she didn't see us."There you go, now you can go to sleep." I talked to Draco, giving him a soft tone but a severe look that meant I wanted him to go back to bed at that exact moment.He nodded again and rubbed his eye with one hand, feeling already tired."Can I have a cuddle before going?""Sure." I opened my arms and he quickly walked into them. We got in a warm hug and I kissed his forehead before he let me go. "Good night, Draco.""Good night," He replied with a sweet and soft tone, going straight to the stairs. As he was going up, he turned around for a brief moment and gave Fred the Slytherin look. "Out of my common room, you dirty traitor."I clicked my tongue, rolling my eyes while the blonde kept his way up and Fred shooked his head looking in Malfoy's direction."Fucking crybaby," he whispered. "Even Ginny is maturer than him.""Fred Weasley talking about maturity? Somebody pinch my arm so I know I'm not dreaming." I teased him, making his expression change as soon as his eyes went back to mine. The cold shine in them softened into a warm brown look and a little smile covered his face."I can be really mature when I want to.""You are the definition of childish, darling." I kept annoying him."Bah! I'm not that childish when I fuck you, am I, Lilith?" he whispered, coming closer to my face.I started walking in the door's direction and quickly opened it, making sure it didn't make any sound and checking no one was in the corridors. Luckily for us, the Dungeons were a very lonely place except for us Slytherins. During the night, only the Bloody Baron used to wander in here but, at that moment, he wasn't in sight.Fred followed me and stood out of the common room, with that arrogant smile still on his face."Guess I'll see you tomorrow." He said, ready to leave."Good night, Freddie." I nodded, with a softer tone.He gave that piercing and mischievous look again, and before I could even notice it he grabbed my neck and covered my lips with his in a slow but passionate kiss. His touch was lazy, burning and addicting, claiming every inch of me in just a kiss, driving my body crazy like only he knew how to. The heat of his hand contrasted with the cold of his silver rings against my neck, making me hold my breath and try to ignore the chills covering me.Fred bit my lower lip separating from me still with that look on his eyes, he smiled again."You were right, darling, the rings look bloody good around your neck," he murmured against my lips. "Good night, Lilith."

Once The Prophet published the name of the Death Eaters who escaped, just a week after we got back to Hogwarts, my name got more attention than I expected.Of fucking course.While I was reading the whole article during breakfast, I made the biggest effort not to look at my mother's picture because I knew it would be too much for me and quickly made eye contact with Liv from across the Hall. She made silent signs to tell me to breathe deeply and calmly and I nodded."Arambella, mommy isn't as stupid as all of us thought, is she? Already planning to join her?" some prick from Ravenclaw shouted as he passed in front of the Slytherin table.Blaise hissed and Draco almost spat in his face."Shut up, you filthy mudblood, before I curse you," the blond threatened, grabbing my hand under the table."Yes, Williams, why don't you go to the Astronomy tower and throw yourself, mate? Bet it would be fun." Blaise added, looking actually pissed off. The Ravenclaw boy chuckled and walked away, running to tell his mates. "This is the first one of today but you know they're going to fuck you up, right?"I sighed, " I do, but can't do anything, can I? I already have detention with Umbridge today for breaking the bloody dress code and honestly, I don't fancy losing my free time with that bitch anymore because I cursed a bunch of knobs.""Then you are lucky you have us," Draco said snobby, while Blaise nodded."Do I? I know Blaise's with me but you've been a teacher's pet to that woman. Where's your Slytherin loyalty, pal?""I'm more loyal to you than to her," He replied proudly."Prove it then," I stood up from the table and grabbed my bag, ready to go, I squeezed Draco's face in my hand, making Blaise hold his laugh, and left a kiss on the blond's cheek. "Gotta go, I have a class with Sprout.""Ouch, Lilith, my cheeks!"The entire morning passed pretty quickly and soon, I was in my last class before lunch; Potions, shared with some Gryffindors. Liv offered to stay with me at the entrance of the dungeons until Severus arrived since her class with Sprout started later."Everyone's losing the plot today, mate. I know it's because of my mother and all that stuff, I was expecting it actually, but did you see how Ginny attempted to curse that Gryff that messed with me? and how Angelina almost pushed one of the other ones?" I spoke in a whisper to Liv while we waited for Severus and the rest to arrive."Yeah, who would have thought that the Gryffs themselves would be defending you from other Gryffindors?" she snorted, laughing. "But you already know what I told you, ignore them and they will end up ignoring you.""For the first time, I'm gonna listen to you." I leaned against the wall, crossing my arms."Finally," she rolled her eyes dramatically, with a little smile. "Took you seven years.""Look who we have in here!" I heard Sienna Plums's voice arriving, being followed by her new boyfriend; Marco Alton, as well as the other Gryffindors in our class. What an incredible couple innit. "How's mommy, Little Snape?""Sienna..." George Weasley snorted, tired, leaning next to me in the wall while taking off his head one of his new inventions for the business with Fred. Potions was the only class I shared with both twins but I had already seen Georgie this morning in Transfigurations and he was as nice as usual to me."What's wrong with you, George? Are you now a Death Eater's friend?" she asked, grossed, giving me an up-to-down look that I responded raising an eyebrow and giving her the Slytherin look."We are not 15-year-olds anymore, girl, you shouldn't be accusing someone of being a blood supremacist just like that. My mate Lilith did nothing wrong," he said passing his arm around my shoulders."Oh, she didn't? Isn't she Circe Snape's daughter?" Alton interrupted, standing with his girlfriend. "I wonder something, Arambella - are you going to learn how to be one of them or are just staying in the role of Death Eaters' whore as your mum?"I noticed how George put discreetly a hand over Fred's chest to stop him. Was he going to defend me too? Am I still dreaming or is this some kind of joke?"Call me a whore again, Alton, and I promise you will be swallowing my boot," I smiled cynic."I'm not scared of you," he claimed not sounding too convinced."You should. Being a Death Eater's child teaches you lots of infamous curses that would make you cry out loud.""She doesn't even need the curses," Liv said behind me, interlacing her hand with mine. "One punch and you are out of the game.""Oh, I forgot," he continued, "Now you have the badger's bitch to defend you as well."I quickly lifted my wand at his throat. Anyone but Olivia, you son of a bitch."Is something wrong going in here?" we heard McGonagall's voice appearing in the corridor. "Ms Arambella, may I ask you why you have your wand out if you aren't in class yet?""I'm sorry, Professor, I was only getting ready for today's lesson," I said pretty quick lowering my wand, without abandoning Alton's eyes and my silent threat to him."Ms Arambella, do you mind if I have a word with you before the class starts?" she spoke, surprising me. "Everyone, inside the dungeons now, please. You'll wait for Professor Snape in there."As the rest of the group entered, I approached McGonagall. Once we were alone, she sighed hard."I reckon some of the students from my house are bothering you about a certain topic that has to do with the Azkaban news."I crossed my arms in front of my chest, a bit uncomfortable."I wanted to apologise to you in the name of the Gryffindor house and I encourage you to tell me their names if they ever repeat such unacceptable actions. You are by far the best student from Slytherin in your course and I don't have anything against you, Miss.""Thank you, professor." I talked, honestly."Also I wanted to say how sorry I am because of Dolores taking you out of the Quidditch team, I couldn't tell you earlier but I recognise you as one of the best players Slytherin ever had and even though I want Gryffindor to win for obvious reasons, I congratulate you for your passion."That was definitely surprising... Did Snape enchant her or something?✵ ✵ ✵After the class finished, Liv went with her housemates to her last lesson of the day while I remembered I had someone to talk to."Luna!" I ran towards the Ravenclaw girl when I saw her getting out of Charms. She quickly turned around and looked at me with a smile."Oh, hey Lilith, how are you doing? I heard the horrible comments people are making about you, probably the Nargles are chanting them to do so.""I'm fine, love, don't worry. I wanted to ask you something, have you seen Neville lately? Need to talk to him.""I think he had lessons with Professor Binns, maybe you can find him at the library.""Thanks, beautiful," I kissed her cheek and waved back at her while going straight in the direction she told me.I found the library completely empty except for two or three kids so it took me less than a minute to find a long-face Neville sitting in one of the couches, lost in one of his Herbology books."Nev, "I spoke to him, trying to find my kindest and softest tone.His green eyes looked at me kinda watery and sad, breaking my heart. I sat next to him and caught one of his hands between mine. "How are you feeling about those people who escaped from Azkaban?"I didn't want to mention her name even though it was pretty clear who I was referring to.It took him a while to start speaking but I waited patiently to listen to him and offer him my support. "I just can't believe it was less than a month when I visited my p-parents... at Saint Mungo, and they are there because of her. I don't have my parents because of her and n-now she's free." he sighed hard and put the book away. "It's so unfair.""It definitely is. But you will get your revenge, Nev. You'll see that bitch will get the end she deserves.""How would I ever beat her?" he snorted with his voice kinda broken. "She's one of the deadliest Death Eaters and I'm- I'm just a failure, Lilith.""You are not a failure, Nev! Who the fuck said that?""My grandma...""Well, forgive me then, but your grandma can fuck off. You're a great and brave wizard, just like your parents. And Bellatrix is not an immune goddess even if she is such as a good Death Eater as you consider her to be, we all bleed the same.""Oh, Godric, but look at us! Here you are comforting me when your mother also escaped from the prison and almost everyone is messing with you, how can I be so selfish not to ask you how you are?""I'm okay, mate, it's not about me now, I'm used to my mother being a pain in the ass. I just wanted to let you know I'm here for you and whatever you need, a' right?"He nodded letting a little smile appear on his face. "Thank you so much, Lilith. I'm so thankful that you are my friend.""Aw, dear," I hugged him tightly. "I'm so thankful for you too, you are literally a piece of heaven."He blushed a little bit and let out a little chuckle."I wish I could stay a bit longer with you but I've got detention with Umbridge, so I'll have to see you later.""Why did she punished you?""For breaking the dress code with my skirt." I rolled my eyes and he tutted, disagreeing with that woman."Professor Umbridge's such a misogynist, I still don't understand how the Ministry allowed her to be a docent.""Me neither, mate," I messed his hair affectionately.He waved back at me and I walked out of the library not ready at all to meet the pink bitch. When I was about to knock on her office's door, I felt a hand grabbing my wrist to turn me around and pin me against the wall.Fred's face was extremely closer to mine."What're you doing? Someone can see us!" I whispered, checking the empty corridors."I was wondering if you'd like to share a cig with me." He murmured with his brown eyes shining and a mischievous smile on his face.His deep voice and captivating tone made me almost melt right there in front of him. I leaned my head against the wall softly and let out a long sigh."Can't, I have detention with Umbridge."He chuckled, surprised. "Again? Are you getting my habit of being a rule-breaker, darling?""Nah, someone snitched about me breaking the dress code and she already warned me before so... here I am.""Aw, poor Lilith..." he fakely pouted, still amused. "But if you want my opinion, that skirt definitely worthed it."The memories of our encounter in my room came to my mind and I couldn't help but bite my lip making him smile widely."Yeah, I think you kinda liked it, didn't you?"Fred snickered, and got closer to me, glueing his body to mine and sliding his hand to my neck."Oh, darling, if only I could escape with you to an empty place in this bloody school and keep you there all day, fucking you until you can't take it anymore...""Mmmh, I wish you could-" I complained, cursing in my mind Umbridge's existence. "But if I don't do this that bitch is going to make the detention longer and honestly, that's the last thing I need right now.""Well, then I'll wait for you here," Fred stated, pretty sure of himself."What?""You heard me, I'll be waiting here until you come out.""Why would you?""Because I genuinely need a cig and I know you do too - Also, George kicked me out of the dorm, he says I'm messing his new creation for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.""Of course," I rolled my eyes, still smiling. "But you don't have to stay here the whole time, Freddie, I can look for you later to have that cig.""Get in there, Lilith. The sooner you start, the sooner you finish.""As you command, sir," I joked and he narrowed his eyes with a feline smile on his face."You know, I think I know a better place where you can call me 'sir'."I couldn't help but laugh a bit too loud and he put a hand on my mouth to shut me. Chills discreetly covered my body."Get in there, darling. I want to get high before midnight," he said, separating from me and walking back to sit on the wall.I took a deep breath and knocked on the door, feeling Fred's eyes on my back. When I heard Umbridge's voice from inside inviting me to enter, I opened the door and closed it behind me."Ms Arambella, I see that you are already learning how to properly wear a skirt. I congratulate you," she spoke, giving a sip to her tea."Does that mean I can leave?""Oh, dear, no!" Umbridge snickered with her unbearable high-pitched voice. "You still need to learn discipline. Now, sit down, please. You already know the proceeding."I put my bag down and sat down wanting to run away from there. I spent the next hour provoking myself a new and fresh scar in my hand, reminding me more of my mother and pissing me off as never before. By the end of the detention, I had I will not dress like a slut carved in my hand with my blood."Can I go now?" I asked her with a cold and deadpan tone. If I could take out my wand and curse her, I would..."Sure, dear, I hope this has taught you to behave like a lady."I nodded - knowing damn well that I would never be the kind of lady she wanted - then, left the office without waiting for any response.The first thing I saw when I got out was Fred still sitting in the wall, leaned against the column and looking at the view of the lake."You waited..." I spoke, surprised. He quickly turned around."I told you," he replied softly. "How did it go?""I've been in worse.""Show me your hand.""There's no need to...""Lilith..." he warned me."C'mon, take me to have that cig, I don't want to look at the scar now that it's fresh..."He sighed hard but seemed to accept it because he got down the wall and started walking. I followed Fred by the empty corridors and couldn't help but give short gazes to him every once in a while.His hair was messy, as usual, his tie poorly hung from his neck with his shirt kinda unbuttoned. My eyes covered quickly the few freckles in his cheeks, which I learnt only appeared when it was cold outside. In a huge impulse, I grabbed the collar of his shirt and pinned him against the nearest door, noticing a huge smile on his face.Before Fred could say anything, my lips went straight to his and I slowly kissed him, letting us feel each other. Taking the control of the kiss because Fred still being surprised, I took my hand to his neck and made the kiss deeper, playing with his tongue and feeling the warmth from his mouth.I could never get enough of him..."Lilith!" I heard a masculine voice calling me, making Fred and I separate. A couple of steps away, my uncle was staring, shocked, at the two of us."Severus."His eyes made an annoyed expression."Mr Weasley I would thank you if you didn't try to eat my niece's face right in front of my office."Fred was going to talk back but I interrupted him, "It was me, sorry."Snape clicked his tongue and made a disgusted facial expression. "Nevermind, I do not want to hear or think about it. I need to talk with you briefly before Mr Potter arrives, Lilith."I scowled. Harry? Why would he meet Harry?"You called me, professor?" the mentioned boy appeared at the end of the corridor, looking a bit clueless and depressed."Mr Potter, if you excuse for one minute I will share a couple of words with my niece and then our class can begin."Class? What am I missing?Harry's face enlightened, "Does that mean I can leave?""It doesn't. Wait right here." Snape hissed, grabbing my wrist and dragging me inside his office."Don't worry, Harry. I'll wait with you." I heard Fred say, still a bit out-of-breath, before Severus closed the door.Turning around to face him, Severus raised one of his eyebrows to look at me."So... you fancy redheads?" he started, still surprised and sitting down. "I guess a family thing."What the fuck? Has my uncle - just made a joke? Who the fuck is this man?

"Fred's a ginger, and I don't fancy him in the way you think. What did you want, Severus?" I asked, still quite confused because of his previous comment.The man in front of me interlaced his fingers and looked at me with the tiredness brightening in his black eyes."Since no one knows which is going to be your mother's next movement, I found it opportune to tell you that, thanks to William Weasley who is working now in Gringotts, half of the money in your chamber, which your mother knew, is now saved in one of the secret ones that belong to the Order. Your mother knows a lot of tricks to be able to get to your money, which is obvious that she will need, so I thought it would be convenient to keep what is yours away from her."I was absolutely surprised. It was a brilliant idea, my mother had access to the previous chamber because it was under the Snape family name so being able to keep half of it far from her was a way to make sure she didn't leave without anything."I know that you were saving that money for your personal things," Severus added."Yes, once I'm out of here, Liv and I planned to move together," I replied. "Thanks, Severus. I can't imagine what I'd do without that money."He nodded, "Now, please go outside and tell Mr Potter to come in.""May I ask what are you two on?""You cannot say anything about it, clear?" he stated, warning me. "I'm teaching him Occlumency."I whistled surprised. Poor Harry..."Are you being as tough with him as you were with me?""Even more. The arrogant snot is just like his father, no matter how many times I try with him, he doesn't resist.""Give 'im time, it took me one whole year to perfection it.""When you were 12, he is 15 and the supposed hero. Do not excuse him, Lilith."I shrugged and opened the door, ready to leave.Talking in front of the door, Harry and Fred turned around as soon as they saw me. Harry's eyes went straight to my hand where the fresh wound was still itching, I hid it discreetly behind my back."Harry, Snape wants you inside his office."The boy grunted and dragged his feet on the ground to enter the room."If you apply camomile it will heal sooner," he whispered before getting inside, lifting his sleeve to show me another scar in his hand, similar to mine, saying I must not tell lies."Thanks, mate."Once Harry got in the office, my eyes went back to Fred. He was leaning against the wall, arrogantly, with his hands in his pockets, examining me."Shall we go?"He stayed silent for a couple of seconds. "If you ever, Lilith Arambella, dare to slam me against the wall and kiss me like that again I promise you I'm fucking you right there, I don't give a fuck who is watching or who isn't, understood?"I snorted."You wouldn't dare.""Don't try me, Lilith."I held back my own laugh, rolling my eyes."Cool, now, let's go.""Do you mind if we go to the old tree instead of the loo? I need some fresh air.""Fine."While we were in the Garden's direction, we found some more students. One of the boys from Hufflepuff approached Fred."Weasley, mate, do you have more of that herb?""I'm busy now.""Oh, come on! It won't take long, I promise. I can give you three galleons."Fred looked at me, like asking for my permission."Go, don't be stupid!" I whispered to him. The ginger walked a bit away with the Hufflepuff boy while I stood there, waiting for him to come back."Have you heard the new rumour?" Sienna's voice was heard a couple of steps away from me. She was talking with Angelina Johnson and Katie Bell, who didn't seem really interested in what the other girl had to say. "People are saying Fred shagged Lavender Brown!"Wait, what?Suddenly, I felt uncomfortable in my own body and the cold invaded me again.Lavender Brown? She is a cute girl from Hermione's year, kinda minds her business and is quite obsessed with Divination. If it was true that Fred had sex with her, I can't complain about it. We are nothing. I can't complain about it.On one side, I wanted to believe that was not true, that it was only a rumour, but on the other, I knew Fred well, and I knew he didn't last long with his sex partners, was he already changing me? Was he already tired of me?I can't blame him...Fred appeared again and dragged me to the spot where we used to smoke hidden."Those Hufflepuffs are getting addicted to this shit, they're the ones who buy the most."I tried to look normal because even though those words were rooting in my head, I couldn't demand him anything and it was quite obvious that the only thing he felt for me was sexual attraction.Why did I have to feel such heavy-hearted?"I'm not surprised, it goes with their vibe.""Yeah, even your friend Olivia bought me some.""My Liv?!"Oh Merlin, Olivia!While he nodded, leaned back against the tree's trunk, leaving one of his legs hanging off the branch, he started to make his blunt with precision and soon, he was already lightening, letting it between his lips as he passed me the lighter and put his hands behind his head.I repeated his actions and quickly gave a long puff to my cig. It felt like therapy..."What's going on in that mind?" he murmured, lazily, with his eyes closed and the cigarette hanging from his lips."What do you mean?""I know you are chewing on something, Lilith...""I'm not telling you." I joked, trying to calm my mind and not ruin the moment."Yeah, let me guess!" he lowered his voice, playfully. "Are you thinking about me shagging you in front of everyone to show them who's driving me crazy?"Are you talking about me or about Lavender Brown, you prick?I chuckled, giving a little kick to his foot."Do you ever think about anything else?""Not when I'm with you, at least if we don't include me thinking about how I enjoy smoking with you. It's a bit of habit by now, innit?""Kinda is, innit." I gave another long puff and looking at him being completely relaxed, I decided to tease him a little bit. "I bet more than one would be jealous right now...""Of me? Of course. I'm not sharing, though." he opened one of his eyes to look at me, with that arrogant and mischievous smile on his face.The devilish part of my mind purred of satisfaction at his words. Oh, Weasley...I couldn't help but pop off the next question that kept wandering in my mind;"Am I?"He looked at me silently, swinging his foot in the air, while grabbing his tie to mess it a bit more and let his neck freer."You aren't." Fred simply said, closing his eyes again and humming a song I recognised as The Chain by Fleetwood Mac.For some reason, his words sounded honest to me and left a mark on my mind, abandoning any name in my head that wasn't his. How could he have such a huge impact on my emotions? My body relaxed and my blood pressure didn't hit in my veins like knives anymore."Good to know."I gave another puff and kept there, breathing the fresh air and having the wind giving soft caresses to the two of us every once in a while with the sound of Fred humming as background."Are you going to show me your hand or do I have to keep pretending I don't know it's bleeding?"I sighed hard, examining it briefly. It was a bit swollen, the letters shined in a scarlet colour making me feel my hand numb because of the persistent but slight pain. Before I could reply, he grabbed my hand and looked at the wound, letting his thumb cover the letters' path."That fucking bastard..." his voice lowered, sounding more dangerous."It's okay, it doesn't hurt.""Don't lie to me, Lilith, of course it hurts."Feeling the blunt already having a big effect on us, Fred took my hands to his lips and left soft kisses in the words; I will not dress like a slut.The blood in my veins burnt and my breathing became heavier and slower as the contact of his lips on my sensitive skin sent quivers all over my body.How could he have such a fuckin' big effect on me?✵ ✵ ✵The rest of January went on pretty quickly between my own homework, tasks and the training with the DA. Since everyone knew about the Death Eaters' escape, all of us were putting even more effort to make our magic and our fight style more precise and advanced. Neville, in particular, was becoming one of the best ones and putting a bigger effort than anyone else, achieving some advanced practices quicker than many others. I felt so proud of him and he insisted on how I kept being a motivation for him, but to me, it was all his work, it was him the one progressing and the one becoming a magnificent wizard.Because of the amount of work we had on our backs and the little free time, I barely saw Fred for more than five seconds in the corridors or during our shared classes, so the few moments I had for myself were to be with Liv or to chill at the Slytherin common room."Tomorrow is Valentine's Day," Liv chanted, sitting on one of the sinks in the empty loo while I sat on the cold floor. February had arrived being wetter than before but a bit warmer, making us not freeze in here."Yoo-hoo!" I sarcastically whooped."Come on! Aren't you excited about it?""I'm not the one with a girlfriend, Liv. Obvs I don't care about Valentine's Day.""Well, it's not like I'm not spending it with you anyway because my girlfriend is in France!""True, am I gonna be your Valentine, Olivia? Are you going to take me on a date to see the moonlight and kiss me under the rain?" I teased, blowing kisses at her."Ew, incest!" she laughed. "I really want tomorrow to arrive so we can go to Hogsmeade. I want to buy something for Pauline...""I wrote to her last week, she told me she wants to give you a cute present tomorrow but she's planning something bigger for your birthday.""Is she?!" Liv shouted, excited, having little sparkles in her blue eyes."Yes, but I'm not going to tell you what it is, obviously.""Lilith! My birthday is still too far away from now.""No, it's not.""Yes, it is!""Olivia, your birthday is the first week of March, for fuck's sake.""That's far," she crossed her arms in front of her chest, faking a pout. "Why did you had to tell me Lin has a gift for me if you don't tell me what is it?""To mess with you, obviously." I stick out my tongue at her and she opened the old water tap to wet her hand and splash me, making me laugh. "Fuck! Ugh - You'd only have to wait until tomorrow to know her first gift, don't complain that much.""I bet someone will have his eyes on you the whole day..." she talked, coming back at me, changing the topic.Fuck no."Don't start, Olivia," I warned her still laughing, narrowing my eyes, trying to look threatening. But that did not affect Liv, she knew me too well."Freddie is going to be jealous of me tomorrow," she continued, with a devilish smile on her face."He's gonna be with his brother, as usual, and with all the Gryffindor lot. He's not going to have time for that"Liv snorted, amused. "That won't keep him away from looking at you every five minutes.""Yeah, sure!" I rolled my eyes, still smiling. "You do daydream a lot, mate. I'll have to take Pride and Prejudice away from you to drag you back to reality.""Don't you dare!" she pointed at me, with her eyes opened widely. "Lizzie and Darcy are the only straight couple I enjoy."The next day, everyone woke up early. I pulled on quickly the jumper Tonks made for me, cuffed my jeans and got my Doc Martens, one of Remus' gifts for me during Christmas, that I shrunk so they could fit me. They belonged to him when he was my age so they had these 70s vibes that I loved and were comfortable enough for long walking.Getting out of my common room, accompanied by Draco and Blaise, I quickly found Liv between the Hufflepuff crowd and she came straight to me, followed by Luna."Morning," I talked first."Happy Valentine's Day, sweety pie!" Liv threw herself to hug me."Don't call me that!" I complained, hugging her back and letting her leave kisses all over my cheek, hearing the rest of our group chuckle."I knew you'd hate it!" she smiled, separating from me."Happy Valentine's Day for you too.""Good morning, Luna. How are you doing?" I heard Blaise behind me speaking in the softest voice he had ever used."Hi, Blaise! I'm okay, had a bit of a weird morning so far. I wanted to put on my favourite shoes, but they have disappeared. It's the second pair that disappears from my room this week. I think the Nargles are behind it..." the blonde girl replied with her sweet tone. I couldn't help but tighten my lips.If I could only know who was the son of a bitch stealing her shoes and hiding them from her...Blaise was about to say something but Draco interrupted, giving Luna a puzzled look."We should go now, the Gryffindors are already out there in the door." He said snobby and authoritarian, starting to walk away. "Blaise!" he called when the boy tried to keep walking with Luna, Liv and me.Snorting, he got next to Draco, getting pretty fast next to the Gryffs, while the girls and I walked unhurriedly.While we were waiting for the professors to open the gates, my eyes went straight to that ginger hair that stood out between the Gryffindor pack. Fred was laughing at something Lee Jordan was telling, wearing a leather jacket Sirius got him for Christmas, cuffed jeans with Doc Martens similar to mine and the rings I gave him.Bloody hell, he was looking good... If that was my Valentine's day gift I was more than pleased.

Once we got to Hogsmeade, I accompanied Liv to buy Pauline's gift for Valentine's Day and later, Luna, her and I had a walk all over the village having a hot chocolate with marshmallows in it. I hadn't seen Fred since we got out of school, but it was okay because I was really enjoying the Lovegood girls' company.Since it was a singular and special day, the professors allowed us to stay for more time than usual so we decided to go to the best pub in all Hogsmeade to have a good butterbeer before going back.Already inside the local, being hugged by the warm atmosphere protecting us from February's cold noon wind, we quickly looked for a free table to sit and chat."Lilith!" Hermione's voice called me from across the place. She made signs to invite us to sit with her, Harry and Ron at their table, which was big enough."Do you want to sit with them?" I asked the girls, making sure they were comfortable.They both nodded and we went straight there with our butterbeer already in our hands."Where have you been, girls?" Harry asked first with a kind tone.I was surprised by how his attitude towards me, a proud Slytherin, changed as we were having more communication during the DA classes."We've been buying a present for my girlfriend. I'll have to send it to her later in the owlery.""Oh, you have a girlfriend?""Is Pauline Bélier, right? You finally made it official," Hermione said pretty quick, making Liv nod."Come again, Hermione, how do you know absolutely everything?" Ron asked again, genuinely confused, making me chuckle."If you had paid a bit more attention during summer, you'd know that Hermione spent a lot of time with me, Liv is my best friend so, of course, 'Mione was with me when I talked to her.""You're expecting too much if you ask Ron to pay attention!""That's not true!""You are always in your own world...""That's what people say to me all the time," Luna talked with a little smile and her soft tone."You see? Luna's on my side," The ginger said, high-fiving her."I wish I could live in that world of yours, Luna. I bet it's so fun.""It's not when the Nargles are bothering, though," she said to me, "But don't worry, everyone has their own world, it's just that some are too embarrassed or too narrow-minded to admit it.""Fair enough," I smiled back, lifting my glass at the same time as her and giving a long sip."Look who we have in here!" A familiar voice said behind my back making me instantly turn around to meet him. Fred walked to our table accompanied by George and Lee."Did you miss us?" George said, sitting quickly next to Hermione, winking at us. His twin and Lee imitated his action and sat down, making us squeeze in the table to give them space."Not a bit.""Oh, c'mon, Ronnie, don't be like that give your big bro a cuddle!""Fuck off!" Ron snickered, trying to stay away from George."Harry, mate, could it be possible that we saw you earlier too close to Cho Chang's face?" Fred interrupted giving the mentioned boy a feline look, making him blush and cover his face with his hands while shaking his head.Liv and I whistled at the same time surprised while the rest of the table laughed."Pal, 're you becoming a ladies man?" Lee teased him."We were just - hanging out." Harry coughed, trying to look confident."Yeah, bet you're giving her some extra lessons, weren't you?" I winked at him, making him go even redder and the rest burst into laughter."Good one, Lilith." Lee high-fived me."The question here is, did you snog her?" George said, making all of us go silent, waiting for Potter's response."Of course I did, back in Christmas, we have done way more than that by now." As soon as he talked, Harry clapped his mouth, regretting not holding it back before.Everyone at the table looked at him, eyes opened widely."Oh, Merlin!" I whispered."Cho's really nice, good for you Harry!" Liv said, trying to make the boy feel more comfortable and less embarrassed, looking at him as if he was a kid."Damn, who would've guessed our Harry already made his début?!""At least I'm getting laid, Fred.""Ohhh!" everyone whooped, I gave a quick sip to my butterbeer and a cocky smirk appeared on Fred's face, his eyes met mine for a brief moment, burning and challenging me, and I tried to hold back my laugh."Fair enough!" he said, leaning back on his seat, putting his eyes again on me."That hurt, eh Freddie," Ron asked amused, making me slightly choke when I heard that nickname. Liv discreetly gave little pats on my back with that big smile on her face."Shut up, Ron, you can't even wank for more than five minutes." He talked back, giggling and crossing his arms in front of his chest.While his little brother was complaining, Fred kept his eyes on me and mouthed 'you, me, talk, later?' to which I nodded slowly, making his smile go bigger."But, wait, Harry, was it really your first time?" I asked him, actually surprised. He was probably the most popular kid at school and he was pretty attractive and nice, I bet more than one person had a crush on him.He nodded."Aww, that's cute.""Wait, does that mean except Fred, Lee, George, Olivia and Harry, the rest of us four are virgins?!" Ron asked, really surprised."You shouldn't assume that," Hermione said pretty quick."Hermione?!""What? I only said you shouldn't assume that, Ron.""Yes, mate, you shouldn't because you're not right," I affirmed, making everyone fix their eyes on me. Fred looking completely amused and winking at me."You-?!" Ron said completely surprised, and when I nodded his eyes opened even more. " Blimey! But you are Snape's niece!""So?" Liv asked laughing, kinda tenderised by Ronald's innocence. "She still has fun, mate.""Well, if it wasn't at school then that'd be more understandable.""Oh, but it was..." I whispered thinking no one had heard me, but everyone went completely silent."Here comes the questions part," Luna said, smiling."With who?!" George asked, genuinely surprised, grabbing Ron's butterbeer without him noticing it, and drinking.I let out a long sigh, trying uselessly to hide my laugh."Cedric Diggory," I murmured as quick as possible and I heard more than one holding their gasp, while Liv, Luna and Hermione chuckled since they were the only ones at this table who knew it."Merlin, Lilith!" George said, snickering and giving a quick gaze at his twin, trying to make it discreet but I noticed. Fred, by his side, had still that smirk on his face but now his eyebrows were raised and his eyes were looking at the floor."Who would have said innocent Diggory wasn't that innocent after all..." Lee joked."What would Snape say if he knew, for fuck's sake!" Harry laughed, following the joke. "But honestly, can't blame you. Cedric was fine.""Harry...?" I asked, looking at him with narrowed eyes. Could it be possible that he was one of mine too?He raised with hands, like giving up. "We are being honest here, aren't we?""Fucking yes, we are!" I touched his glass with mine and finished the rest of my butterbeer. "Cheers, mate!""I'm still surprised, though!" Lee said, snickering."You lot just think that because Lilith is professor Snape's niece she's just another Slytherin. You should know she definitely knows how to have fun!" Hermione claimed, pretty proud, making me wink at her discreetly."Slytherin knows how to have fun, lads."George, Lee and Ron snorted at the same time."Not that sure about that one, Arambella. Your house doesn't have the balls.""We do, it's just that we know how to not get caught, unlike you.""I have to agree with that," Fred started, calling our attention. "Slytherin can be quite fun.""And how do you know that?" Ron asked confused, ignoring George by his side chuckling silently."Don't ask me things you don't want to know, Ronnie," Fred replied calmly, giving me a quick gaze."Nah, I won't believe it until I see a proper funny Slytherin who isn't Lilith!" the Gryffindor boy claimed. "Gryffindor is the funniest house and I die by that.""Hufflepuff can beat all of you in a second." Liv talked, pretty confident, still using her sweet tone."C'mon, Olivia, your house spends most of the time stoned as fuck!" Fred snickered, " I know it first hand.""Exactly, that's why we are the best.""Wait, Hufflepuff?! Really?!" Harry interrupted, absolutely incredulous."Harry, honey, we are the best at Herbology, our common room is next to the kitchens and almost every Hufflepuff gives calm and good vibes. Join the dots."You couldn't discuss that logic, could you?"Ravenclaw can be fun too," Luna added."Absolutely agree! They do have some good smart humour. I like it." Lee replied, grabbing his own butterbeer to give it a sip."All of you can say whatever you want but no one beats Slytherin.""Bah!""I'm being serious! We are demonized but, believe me, sometimes being in Slytherin is like being in a non-stop soap opera. Our common room is far from all the rest, Bloody Baron is chill as fuck, and we learnt how to distract my uncle to keep him away from our business. If someone parties hard, that's us."They kept discussing which one of the houses was the best and I stood aside, just observing it as a tennis match until the butterbeer had too much effect on me."I need to go to the loo, Hermione, do you mind coming with me?" I asked her since she was the only one that wasn't participating in the little war house as well. Liv was almost dying of laughter at some anecdote George was telling about the Gryffindor tower and Luna seemed pretty comfortable talking with Lee."Sure!" She made George and Fred move to let her come with me and we quickly interlaced our arms not to lose each other on our way to the loo because of the number of people in the pub."Could you hold me the door from outside? They don't close well," I said, getting in one of the old cubicles.Two seconds later, I heard her voice from behind the dusty and old door."Lilith, now that we are alone, can I ask you something?""Obvs! Go on.""Have you had sex with Fred?" she asked, quite amused.Hang on - what?I felt the stream cutting because of how surprised I was at her question and my heart raced in my chest."Where did you got that from?" I snorted, trying to sound confident, but it didn't work out."Just by how he looks at you.""Really?""Yes, it's like he's craving you, Lilith. Even I felt intimidated by it and it wasn't directed to me."I took a deep breath, was it that much? I could feel him burning me every time our eyes met but because of the huge effect he had on me, the sensation felt triplicated. I didn't think someone else could feel it too."And how do you know we had sex and not that he wants to fuck me but he hasn't?" I questioned, getting out of the cubicle and washing my hands. I saw Hermione laughing through the mirror."So you admit it.""I haven't said that." A little smile appeared on my face."Easy, you look at him the same way," she replied, arrogantly. "And I might not be an expert in this topic but the way you two react to each other when you are near...""Fine, we had." I finally admitted, unable to erase my smile."I knew it! It was confirmed to me when he talked about Slytherin like that... Oh, and the marks on his neck and that cocky smile he appeared with a month ago couldn't be a coincidence!""I haven't told you before because I think only Liv and George know.""Oh, don't worry, I'm glad I got to figure it out by myself," she claimed, proudly."Yes, you've got to brag the little pretty know-it-all you are," I stick my tongue at her and she blushed, laughing."But you can be sure I won't be telling anyone.""I know, 'Mione, I trust you," I leaned against the sink, stretching my legs. "Is it too obvious?""By him? A little bit. By you? Not that much. Someone else has to have known you two previously to guess it.""Good, because I don't want anyone to know about my sexual life, I had enough with Draco hearing us that time."Hermione took her hand to her mouth, with her eyes opened widely."What? And aren't you scared that he can say it to someone?""Draco? Nah, he is not a snitch. At least not with me. He appreciates me a lot.""Can't believe we are talking about the same Draco Malfoy.""I trust him.""You are amazing, Lilith." Hermione chuckled, back to the ginger's topic, "I'm still trying to process it because I thought you two hated each other!""Oh, we definitely did! But you started hating me too and look, now you adore me, don't you 'Mione?" I joked, winking at her."Merlin! Are you going to still flirt with me?" she laughed, incredulous. "And I didn't hate you, I just felt intimidated.""Of course I am! You are my friend! And if Ron doesn't flirt with you, someone has to do it, love.""What? I-" She asked, confused and paler but I interrupted her, smiling."You are not the only one noticing things, mate.""We should go, I bet they are waiting for us," she smiled back, biting her lip.We got out of the loo between laughs and trying to catch fresh air since the atmosphere was hot because of all the people in the pub. When we got to the table, they had changed the topic into complaining about our different subjects but when I was about to sit down, Fred caught my wrist.His only touch sent chills all over my body and I could feel Hermione raising her eyebrow, amused."It's almost eight o'clock, wanna have a cig out there before leaving?" he offered, lowering his voice a little bit.I nodded grabbing my jacket and putting it on."Liv, Luna, are you good?"They both smiled at me. "Yeah, mate, don't worry. We are complaining about Severus, go smoke in peace." Liv winked at me, going back to her conversation.I followed Fred to the door and as soon as he opened it, a cold breeze of air hit us. He walked outside, rubbing his hands to warm them and then taking the cigarettes pack and lightener from the pocket of his jacket. He lightened one for him and then gave it to me. The two of us gave a long and deep puff filling the air around us with smoke.I thought he would stay at the door but he started to walk into the little alley with no exit that separated the pub from the other building next to it, hiding us from every kind of curious eyes.I got closer to the wall and he took the cigarette to his lips, observing me."What?" I asked him, chuckling nervously.He shooked his head."I was thinking about how, little by little, I'm learning more about you.""I like being mysterious.""Can't argue you that." Fred sounded pretty convinced, approaching me slowly. He put one of his hands against the wall, cornering me and letting me feel his corporal heat in the middle of the cold breeze. "Haven't seen you properly in a while, Arambella." He whispered, very close to my face."I know, but you are seeing me now, aren't you?"He smiled and lowered his face to kiss slowly my jawline, making a path to my lips."I thought you wanted to share a cig, Freddie." I teased him, glueing my back more to the wall. He took a long puff with his eyes still on me and grabbed my chin to bring my face closer to him, with the arrogance and mischief shining in his dark eyes, he left the smoke out right in my lips, letting me breathe it from him."And you believed me? Oh, darling, I thought you knew me better..." he joked, throwing the finished cig away. I threw mine to the ground and extinguished it putting my boot on it. Looking at him straight in the eye, I grabbed the collar of his jacket to bring him closer to me."I know you way better than you think," I whispered against his lips, seeing how he got goosebumps. I loved the raw effect I had on him. "Kiss me, Freddie, we both know you are dying to do so."He growled with a smirk on his face, and with one hand still on the wall, he glued his body to mine - making me feel his hips slamming me harder against the rocky wall - and took his other hand to my neck. Quickly, his mouth covered my lips trapping and having me back at his feet. He kissed me slowly, messily and sinfully, like only he knew how to. His tongue played with mine and claimed dominance in the kiss but I refused, taking my hand to his hair and pulling, trying to take control. I noticed how he snickered raspy against my lips and I made the kiss even deeper, making his most primitive part come out. I could already feel my underwear going wet as his fingers put more pressure on my neck."I have the control here, Lilith," he whispered, separating very slightly his mouth from me."Do you, Freddie? Because I don't think so." I teased him to then bite his lower lip. Fred let out a long and deep breath, smiling.His lips met mine again, going faster and rougher in the kiss but letting me guide it.Good boy, Freddie.The hand in my neck started to slowly go down in my body and when it got to the start of my jeans, he quickly sneaked inside of them and inside of my underwear, making me gasp in the kiss at feeling his contact against my sensitive skin. Separating again a little bit from my lips and staring at me with that fierce look in his eyes and a proud smile, he started to move his hand in between my legs, caressing me slowly. A little moan escaped from my lips and drowned in his."Do you think so now, darling?" he murmured, teasing me with his deep and raspy voice, melting me right there. "Only a few kisses and your perfect pussy is already this wet for me, how could I even think about resisting to you?"Two of his fingers entered inside of me while his thumb started to do slow circles in my clit as he took his lips to my neck to leave soft but wet kisses."Fred..." The idea of being outside with the possibility of being caught turned me on even more. He moved his hand on the wall to surround my waist and I put one of my legs around his hip to give him more access to me. I moaned, feeling his fingers going deeper into me."You are the most addictive drug I ever tasted, Lilith..." he whispered against my skin and then did a little path from the start of my collarbone to my jaw with the tip of his tongue, sending tingles all over my body."Freddie...I-" I couldn't even form a word when another little moan escaped from my mouth and I felt my breathing going more erratic, I made a little sound complaining as his fingers were going faster inside but his thumb kept the slow and torturing circles. Fuck."Don't say anything, darling. You don't have an idea of how much I enjoy watching the little mess you become every time I touch you." Fred bit my lip slowly. "Shit, I would rip these jeans off and fuck you properly if I could..."Sucking the exposed skin in my neck, I let out another moan, feeling dizzy and bewitched by the heat already forming in my body in contrast with the cold air around us."You are about to cum, aren't you, darling?" he smirked, arrogantly."Yes!" I whispered in his lips, with the sensation giving me goosebumps and feeling already at the top of the rollercoaster as his fingers kept fucking me."Look at you, I'm not even fucking you hard and you are already coming around my fingers," Fred murmured, amused. "My pretty and needy Lilith"I couldn't hold it anymore, white dots appeared in my sight and I noticed how my voice choked in my own silent moans as I reached my limit, whining of pure pleasure in his arms."Good girl..." he talked in a very deep and mischievous murmur. I smiled."Hmm, I don't mean to impose, but the professors just said they are already requiring us," we heard Liv's sweet and amused voice from the other side of the wall, luckily, she couldn't see us since she was against the other wall, at the start of the alley."We're going, Olivia. Let me finish the cig." Fred quickly said, noticing my voice was still too weak to reply by myself."Aha, I bet you two are smoking." Liv snickered, with her voice full of sarcasm, as we heard her starting to give a couple of steps back, probably going to join the others."S'pose our fun is ruined," he protested, making a fake pout, looking back at me."But what about you?" I said since I could feel him hard against me and I wanted to give him the same attention he did with me."We will have time for that," Fred whispered, touching my lips with his. He took his hand from my jeans and separating a little bit from my body, with his eyes fixed on mine, he took the fingers that were previously inside of me and sucked the wetness from them. "Fucking delicious..."He grabbed my neck making me get closer to his face, still a bit out of breath, and left a single soft kiss on my lips."Happy Valentine's day, darling."Fred's hand moved to my wrist and he made me follow him outside of the alley. Once we got a couple of steps away from it, we found the huge group of students, in which Liv was waiting for us with her eyebrows raised, a smirk on her face, and arms crossed. I winked at her and she laughed.We went back to Hogwarts talking normally as if nothing had happened. 

Time kept going by and the twins, Harry and I got to see the first match without us in the Quidditch teams and I found myself surprised at how an incredibly good player Ginny was and how much I wanted to slap that Goyle and take the broom to play the match by myself. Bloody hell, Umbridge, why did you have to take my favourite thing in the world from me the last year I could enjoy it at school?Also, thanks to the Lovegood family, we got the opportunity to make a movement against that bitch. Xenophillus Lovegood dared to give Harry a complete interview without the Ministry's censorship and that drove everyone crazy. During the first week of March, everyone kept going around with their copy of the Quibbler, reading everything Harry had to say.The movement got its effect on the Inquisitor since the first thing she did after reading the whole article, was create a new decree that forbade every student to own a copy of the magazine. Luckily for us, we managed to keep them hidden and Harry's words were secretly known by everybody - as well as Liv and Luna being treated incredibly well by everyone, thanks to their father's bravery. Very few people trusted the Quibbler before because of its eccentricity but that was precisely what made it a free and safe place out of the Ministry's eye to tell everything they didn't let us say out loud.Even the professors managed to own their copy and show their support to Harry and I heard the twins made a spell to make the cover of the Quibbler huge and hung it in the Gryffindor common room while Harry's picture in it shouted against the Ministry. All of this, obviously, made Umbridge act even more bitchy than before, guided by rage. If it was possible for that woman to be more bitchy."Happy birthday, Liv!" I chanted happily, taking my copy of the magazine back into my bag and taking out the gift I got her. I ran to the Hufflepuff table where everyone was singing Happy birthday to my best friend as Luna approached with a homemade cake she did for her sister."Thank you, sister!" Liv stood up to hug me and I covered her face in little kisses, making her snicker.I handed her the first gift, watching how her eyes opened widely and were full of emotion."Lilith! Is this what I think it is?!" she said taken her hand to her mouth as soon as she saw the tickets. I bought her a reservation in one of the most famous hotels in Paris to enjoy a night there with Pauline. "Oh, Merlin, this is amazing! Thank you so much!""Wait, I'm not done!" I took out of my pocket a little box that she opened carefully. When Liv saw the gold necklace with a little hound, her Patronus, in it, she almost cried."It's so beautiful!" her voice trembled and she went back to hug me."That's not even half of what you deserve, Liv. I'd give you the world if I could."The Hufflepuffs made Luna and me a little space at their table - discreetly, so Umbridge wouldn't see us - and we ate the cake Luna made and stayed there for a little while, hanging out with Liv and making sure this birthday was as good as possible. She got even more excited when Pauline's letter and her dad's one arrived along with some beautiful gifts that she treasured and appreciated.Three days later was Remus's birthday as well, so the first thing I did as I woke up was packing the gifts I got for him and go to the owlery to send him a letter; I wished him the best of birthdays and thanked him for everything he had done for me. Tying the paper to Iris's little leg, I also put the two David Bowie vinyl records I got him as well as a mug that had 'Best teacher in the world ' written and a sweater I knitted myself with Liv's help in a tiny bag that had a Capacious Extremis spell to let little Iris carry it.That night, during dinner, my owl came back with a note from Lupin that really melted my heart and made me feel so good to know I made his birthday a little bit better;Dear, Lilith:

I can't even find enough words to thank you! You are truly one of the best gifts I could ever have. Sirius almost cried when he saw the Bowie vinyl records (I never imagined you would remember how much I like him!) and I had a good hot chocolate in the mug. Loved the sweater as well! Probably one of the cosiest ones I've ever worn!

Thank you so much, love lots and always proud of you. XX

P.S: Sending hugs to Liv as well! Her dad did a great job.

- Remus.I kept that note, as well as all of the previous ones I received, in my dorm and felt incredibly thankful for having an adult figure like Remus near me.Two weeks went by between stress, homework and more people going against Umbridge and the entire Ministry's lie, which caused the bitch to abuse her power by attempting to fire professor Trelawney from her job. I have to admit Divination was never my favourite subject nor my most hated one but seeing Sybil crying and feeling humiliated didn't sit well with me.During these days, Harry summoned the entire DA for another training that went pretty well since all of us were putting lots of effort into it. Nev, especially, was standing out as one of the best ones in the entire group."We need to have a little talk," Potter announced, calling our attention after finishing the training. "First of all, our first magic class in April will be focused on the Patronus spell, I know some of you already know how to perform it but it would be nice if the rest learns it as well.""Fred's and mine is a magpie. We've already tried." George claimed proudly when Angelina asked him which was his."The other thing I wanted to comment is how much the Inquisitorial Squad is trying to fuck us up. We have to do something." Harry continued, sighing.That was true, for some reason, a quite big group of students agreed with Umbridge and behaved like her muppets. Much to my dismay, Draco was one of them. Ugh."We locked Graham Montague in some weird vanishing shit we found the other day," Fred shouted, full of pride as his twin and Lee Jordan clapped, amused.So that was why I haven't seen him in a while... Good.Since the second half of the course started, Fred and George had been pulling some of the best pranks of their lives just to annoy Umbridge and I couldn't be happier about that."I've been using some of the stuff the twins gave me from their creation and used it against a bunch of the Squad. " I talked as well, receiving some curious looks. "They are already suspecting a little bit of me so my next prank against Crabbe and Goyle has to be softer.""What did you use?" George asked me genuinely curious."I used Ton Tongue Toffee on Warrington, the Fever Fudge on Bulstrode and the Puking Pastilles on Montague before he 'vanished'." I named proudly, counting with my fingers, noticing the twins' huge smiles."Wow!" Harry chuckled. " You kept that pretty quiet, Arambella!""A girl has to keep her secrets, mate. I don't want to visit Umbridge's office again.""I'm so fucking proud. Kids are growing." George snickered, while Fred put a hand on his chest and pretended to wipe a tear;"They learn so fast.""That's pretty cool, but we have the most dangerous one from the Squad bothering us. Someone has to do something with Malfoy." Ron said and my smile faded slowly away."Not with Draco, please..." I complained in a low voice. I know he is being a bit of a son of a bitch but still, he is too important to me."I know you care about him, Lilith, I still don't know why, though. But you have to admit he and the entire Slytherin house are being a huge problem," Harry said, trying to make me understand."Wait, I know Draco is being a pain in the ass and I'm not going to excuse him but not the entire house of Slytherin is in the Inquisitorial Squad, mate.""Aren't they?" Smith, from Hufflepuff, snorted ironically."They aren't," I said, pretty serious. "Just because none of you befriends them doesn't mean every Slytherin agrees with Umbridge or is planning to become a Death Eater. You'd be surprised at how many people from my house noticed the pranks I was pulling on the rest and kept silent or even helped me indirectly."Everyone stayed silent, considering my words or keeping how they didn't agree with me to themselves. But I kept talking;"Do you think I haven't noticed I'm the only Slytherin in the DA? And that the only reason I'm here is that I'm Hermione's and Luna's friend? I know if it wasn't like that, none of you would've ever considered including me in the non-evil lot just 'cause of the house I'm in. But if I have learnt that Gryffindors are more than a bunch of arrogant show-offs that only care about themselves and about the main-character complex they have, you can learn not every Slytherin is a Death Eater or is made of pure wickedness. We have to deal not only with our reputation but with your prejudice, so maybe try to be a little bit more open-minded next time before you become the actual bad guys.""Chapeau," Liv said with a smile on her face."Honestly, she is completely right," Hermione sighed, surprising me. "We should have considered more Slytherins.""But how would we know which of them are good or not?" Ron questioned, tired."By asking her, Ronald! No one knows Slytherin better than Lilith.""Thank you, 'Mione." I smiled at her. "But yes, I had to prove I'm good and worthy of being here to all of you while you lot know some people in your houses haven't been the kindest not only to me but to Olivia and Luna as well." I reminded them, having in my mind a large list of names of Gryffs and Raves that used to disrespect us."Once again, you shut mouthes," Liv whispered in my ear, making me chuckle."Ok, then, let's try to keep the counterattacks to the people who we know for sure are in the Inquisitorial Squad," Harry said, going back to the main topic. "Lilith, the ones we know are in your house, if you learn about anyone else joining, tell us and please, keep bothering them as much as you can."I nodded and Harry kept giving instructions on how we had to keep the Squad and Umbridge away from the Room of Requirement.While everybody was getting their stuff ready to leave back to our common rooms or the Hall, the twins called almost everyone's attention by showing some of the new creations they had for their prank business. If they keep having this much attention, they will end up striking it rich.As I observed them, with a little smile on my face, and how the people made a circle around them - as the performers they have always been - I noticed someone walking to get by my side."You know, you're kinda giving us a bunch of lessons this year," Potter said, with a gentle look." You kinda need it and deserve it, don't you think, Harry?""After what you said today, maybe yes," he snickered, putting his eyes back on Fred and George. "They are triumphing, aren't they?""I'm not surprised, though. They're the best at it.""Their birthday is soon. I'm planning to give them a bit of help with their whole business thing.""Really? When is it?" I asked, genuinely curious, putting my eyes on Fred, who was smiling as he showed Liv some weird thing in his hands."1st of April.""You're joking!""I wish I was.""Of fucking course it had to be April Fool's." I chuckled. "And what are you giving them?""When I won the Triwizard Tournament, I got an economic award. I gave them already half of it but, to be honest, they're gonna give it a better use than me so I'll give the rest."A cold chill covered me from up to down when Harry mentioned the tournament. It still left a bitter flavour in my mouth and cooled my blood."I bet they'd thank you a lot.""What are you giving them?""I can't tell you, mate! It's a secret!""Oh, but I told you mine!""Well, that sounds like a 'you' problem. Better learn how to keep a secret next time." I messed his hair and started to walk away, hearing him chuckle. "See you, Harry."As I walked next to Liv, watching the object Fred gave her to try the new prank creations, a whole list of ideas appeared on my mind.I have the perfect gift for him and I know he will love it.

April Fool's arrived as the calm from another couple of days full of homework and subjects to study which took all of our time. Whoever said Year 7 was easy should be sent to fucking Azkaban. Sadly, it was a Monday but everyone had their best mood and adrenaline in our bodies waiting for all the jokes and pranks meant for today.That morning, as soon as I got out of my dorm, I went straight to the main living room where I saw Blaise and Draco hanging out.A little devilish smile appeared on my face.I pretended to have anxious breathing as I approached Draco, putting my hand on his shoulder to call his attention. He turned around to look at me but when he saw my facial expression his eyes opened widely and quickly stood up worried, as I noticed how Blaise behind him had an amused expression on his face, trying to hold his laugh back."Lilith, are you okay? What's wrong?" Draco asked, whispering."Need to tell you something in private." I made my voice stutter. He grabbed my wrist carefully and took us nearer to the big glass wall where no one was near us."Tell me," he spoke with a soft voice and for a tiny little moment, I felt bad about what I was about to do. I sighed hard and lowered my eyes to my shoes."Draco... I think I'm pregnant," I whispered and took my hand to my mouth to try to make him think I was trying to hold my sobs when actually I was trying to hold my laugh. "And, what's worse, Fred Weasley is the father..."The blond boy got paler."What?! Bloody hell, Lilith! You got yourself pregnant with that bloody carrot?! Are you serious? I thought you were smarter!" he mumbled, trying not to shout. He ran his fingers through his hair. "Oh, fucking hell, another Weasley? You cannot tell me I'm going to be the uncle of a Weasley. No, that's not possible, no. I fucking hate my life." He took deep breaths. "Ok, first of all, do you wanna keep it?""I still don't know." I pretended to stutter."Fine, uhm - if you wanna get rid of it, I think mum knows how but if you want to keep it we can't let Weasley know. Let's hope your genes are stronger than that git's ones and the kid looks like you, maybe... maybe we can say he is Diggory's child. Yeah. Wait no, we can't do that, fuck. What about if we say he is a half-blood? You met the father in one of your muggle parties and it was a one-night stand. I can deal with a half-blood child but not with another carrot Weasley.""Oh Merlin, you do hate them, don't you?" I questioned, genuinely surprised, breaking off the character."I do," he said quickly, thinking too much to notice I wasn't crying anymore. "But don't worry, I'll help you raise it, I don't have any idea of how to deal with kids but it can't be that hard, can it? Oh, bloody hell, have you told your uncle?! Fucking shit, he's going to kill Weasley." Draco chuckled nervously. "He deserves it though, he should fucking learn how to use a contraceptive spell at fucking time.""Draco..." I called him, with my voice calmer."What? Any more bad news?" he said in the same tone, biting his nails.A huge smile appeared slowly on my face and he scowled, confused."Happy April Fool's."His shoulders fell and his mouth opened widely."I-" he started but took a deep breath. "I cannot fucking believe you did this to me, Lilith Arambella! My poor heart is about to leave my body! Fuck!"Blaise - who kept listening to the conversation from his place - and I burst into laughter at the same time. I hugged Draco and he hugged me back still trying to catch air and chuckling nervously."I thought we were pretty much dead because your uncle would kill you and kill me in the way for covering you, fucking shit. I was even going to suggest you give the child my last name so he could have money enough. Shit, I'm not prepared for this." Draco separated from me to catch more air. "This shit has hit me so hard I can't even be mad at you, I'm just relieved it's not true. Crabbe, go get me a bloody apple juice, I need to relax!"Still snickering, I filled Draco's cheeks with kisses and high-fived Blaise on my way out of the common room. Soon, I found Liv in the corridor. I wasn't planning to pull any prank on her because if there was someone who could read me even if I did my best to lie, that was her."Happy April Fool's Day, Lilith," she said, smiling at me, interlacing her arm with mine. "Any plans for today?""Yes! I've got to give Georgie and Fred their gift. Today's their birthday."She snorted, laughing. "How ironic!"I nodded and we walked together towards the Gardens where we saw a little lot of Gryffindors chilling under the tree. We approached them, noticing how we gained some of the other people from that house's bad looks but ignoring them, and quickly realised they were doing a circle around the twins."Morning, lads." I started, calling their attention, as Liv sat on the fresh grass next to Luna, who was accompanying Ginny. Fred's eyes were the last ones to focus on me but the ones I noticed the most, as usual. "Good day, innit?""Bloody awesome!" George said, snickering. "We've inaugurated our eighteens pretty good, didn't we, Freddie?"A devilish smile appeared slowly on the mentioned boy's face, sending quivers all over my body. "We did, Georgie.""Really? Surprise me then.""Better let Ronnie tell," George replied, patting his little brother's shoulder. "Or the entire Gryffindor house.""They put some weird rope in the door and I ended up hanging from the frame," Ron whispered, kinda annoyed, ripping a blade from the ground."They spread a magic red powder all over the living room and for some weird reason, none of the professors can see it! McGonagall thought it was us the ones who were pranking her!" Hermione protested, showing me her shoes full of that scarlet red dust."Fred put fireworks under my bed and now McGonagall assumed it was me even though I'm banned from getting near fireworks." Seamus Finnigan protested, with his face a bit covered in soot. Oh, boy..."George put on my head the Headless Hat while I was sleeping and Neville fainted when he saw me," Dean Thomas continued, looking at the mentioned boy, who left a single chuckle out."Oh, Nev!" I made a little pout looking at him. "Are you good?""Yes, don't worry. I'm fine!" he said, with a smile on his face."How did you two have time enough to do all that?!" I snickered, genuinely surprised. "The day has just begun!""And that's not all we have planned," Fred smirked, winking at me. Fuck, control the hormones, Lilith. I smiled, trying to play it cool."Yeah, don't think we've forgotten about the Slytherins, my dear friend.""Oh, really?! Then, I guess I'll have to return the gifts I got for some annoying twins...""No!" they both said pretty quick at the same time."A little prank doesn't hurt anyone, Lilith..." George tried to convince me."We promise we'll be good..." Fred continued to then bite discreetly his lower lip."Fine, but make sure the prank doesn't affect me!"They both shrugged. "We can't promise you anything!""But we still want our gifts." Fred continued, looking at me with his piercing eyes and raising his eyebrows, challenging."Well, since I don't get to know when the Slytherin prank is, then you don't get to know when I'm giving you the gifts.""Oh, c'mon, Lilith!" the two of them protested at the same time like little kids, making all of us giggle.✵ ✵ ✵"Is the plan working?" I asked Liv, sitting by her side discreetly during tea time. She smiled."Yes, Luna has already asked professor Sinistra to give her the key to the Astronomy tower and I gave Dobby the four galleons and ten sickles you gave me in exchange for the food." she handed me a little bag that had a Capacious Extremis spell."Great, thank you." I kissed her cheek."You're lucky she doesn't have any class today there and Luna is the best student in Astronomy to ever exist. Sinistra trusts her with her life so be careful what you do up there.""Don't worry, she will find it just as perfect as she left it," I whispered at her, taking my cup of tea to my lips and taking a long sip.Liv stayed looking at me with curiosity and amusement. "Let me guess, you are taking Fred up there, aren't you?""Probably...""And what're you two gonna do?""Liv... do I really have to explain it?"She almost spat her water, laughing "Oh, Merlin, no! I knew I shouldn't ask.""As if you didn't already know me, mate.""Well, then I hope he takes you... to see the stars.""Olivia, no," I warned her trying to look serious because of the stupid joke she just did but the way she was laughing, making pig-like little noises, made me burst into laughter too. "Bloody hell, your humour is broken, girl.""As if you didn't already know me," she imitated my words, taking one of the chocolates on my plate to eat it herself discreetly as if I wasn't looking at her straight in the eye and noticing every single one of her movements.My eyes went briefly at the Gryffindor table, watching how George stood up and started to walk away, leaving his twin talking with Lee as he kept eating."There goes George, time to give him my gift," I said to Liv, standing up from the Hufflepuff table right when a group of taller boys did so they could cover me from the professors' sights. "See you later!""Fine, but don't get yourself pregnant, please. Draco has told me about that prank you pulled on him, you bitch." Liv snickered, and I blew a kiss in her direction.I ran behind George trying to get him before he'd disappear from my sight. Apparently, he was going in the boys' loo direction."Oi, George!" I called him through the corridor when he was about to get in. He turned around and looked at me, interested."Oh, hey, Lilith," he smiled at me."I've something for you.""Can it wait five seconds? I really need to have a wee." he made a little funny pout."I'll be fast, promise." I opened my bag and handed him his gift. His eyes opened widely and a huge smile covered his face."Wicked, Lilith! Thank you so much!" George thanked me, with a genuine tone, he opened his arms to give me a brief hug with pats on my back and stood there admiring the box with the things I got for him in Hogsmeade inside; some music cassettes from Dominic's Maestro, a Kenmare Kestrels -his favourite Quidditch team- flag, with the signatures from the team and a leprechaun in the middle, that I got from Spintwitches and a copy of some pages from my uncle's Potions book that I wrote down for them to use the little tricks in their creations. "Fuck, I can't wait for Freddie's face once he sees this!""Weren't you going to have a wee?""Oi, yes! I almost forgot!" he laughed, and messed my hair a little bit as a sign of affection. "Thank you so much again, Lilith! You're great.""No need to thank me, mate. Happy birthday and go, get in the loo before you pee your pants, for fuck's sake!"He nodded and quickly got inside the place, leaving me in the middle of the corridor. I turned around, taking from the bag Liv gave me the little key from the Astronomy tower. I needed to have everything ready for the great moment.Once I got upstairs and into the circular room, I took the little bag and started to take out the most important things from it. I put over the floor a huge dark blue blanket made of silky and warm material that Liv gave me as well as five candles with jasmine scent that Pauline sent me, both for Christmas. Then, I took all the food and put it on the blanket carefully, like an actual picnic, with the bottle of French champagne Pauline sent as well, from the factory her parents owned as the heritage of her father's muggle parents. It looked quite expensive and fancy with that little golden ram carved in the bottle as the symbol of the girl's family.Putting carefully the two glasses next to the bottle, I stood up. It was already dawn and the waxing gibbous moon was kinda visible in the almost dark blue clear sky. I was lucky today wasn't a rainy day in Scotland.I gave a quick spin to check everything was how I planned. It was even better than that, it was perfect.Time to look for Freddie.Leaving everything just like that and making sure I closed the tower's door behind me, I went back to the first floor's corridor to look for the ginger. It took me just a minute to find him, accompanied by George, who was showing him the gifts I got him."Oi, Weasley!" I shouted across the corridor, making the two of them raise their heads to look at me. A little mischievous smile formed on my face as I approached them."Good to see you again, Lilith." George greeted me. "I was bragging in front of Fred about the amazing gifts you got me. You hear that, Freddie? Me, not you.""Oh, shut up, George," Fred snickered, pushing slightly his twin. "I must have pissed off Lilith so much for you being the first one of us to get the gift from her.""What makes you think you did?" I raised one of my eyebrows, amused."Well, it's pretty clear I'm the twin you like the most, duh. Why wouldn't you give me the gift first otherwise?""Wait, who told you you were my favourite twin, Fred?" I teased him, pretending to look both surprised and indignant."Yeah, Fred, who did?" George added, amused.He snorted, chuckling. "Do you really want me to say how I know I'm your favourite twin, Lilith?" he provoked, winking at me."Oh!..." George whispered, turning around to chuckle.I crossed my arms in front of my chest and looked challenging and amused at the same time."You know what? Georgie is winning some points right now.""I always win." George bragged, still laughing."Oh, Lilith, don't be like that, today's my birthday. Let me be a bit of a prick," Fred smiled back, making a fake pout."You say that as if I didn't let you every single day whether is your birthday or not.""Fine, fair enough.""George, I need to steal the prat of your twin for a bit, do you mind?" I said with my eyes still on Fred, who raised his eyebrows genuinely interested."All yours, mate.""Follow me, Frederick, before I regret it." I dimly smirked starting to walk away noticing how the ginger was behind me. I turned around briefly to wave back at George. "Bye, Georgie!""Bye, Lilith! Have as much fun as you can with your least favourite twin! I know it's gonna be hard without me."Fred snorted again. "Shut up, George," his twin winked at him while he grabbed my wrist discreetly making me walk again, getting far from the rest of the people and letting me guide him to the tower."Where are we going?" he asked two seconds later."You'll see once we get there.""Are we already there?" Fred asked again five minutes after that, sounding like a 5-year-old."If you don't shut up, I'm kicking your ass back to the Gryffindor tower.""You wouldn't dare.""Don't try me, Freddie."He took a deep and long breath and I felt his eyes piercing my back. "So we are going back to 'Freddie', huh? I like how this is going."I bit my lip smiling now that he couldn't see my face. Two minutes later, we got in front of the tower's door and I unlocked it."Oh, are we sneaking into the Astronomy tower?" Fred asked excited in a little whisper."We are not sneaking, mate, don't you see I've got the key? And you can talk normal, there's only the two of us.""Now, I like it even more how this is going..." he murmured behind me, glueing his body to my back. I turned around and made our faces stay very close to each other."You are going to love it, Freddie," I whispered in his lips to then bite his lower one, making him smile as his pupils grew in his brown irises, darkening his eyes.We kept going upstairs and when we finally got in the room, the sky was already dark with the first stars shining as the night approached, leaving an intimate vibe all over the space with a soft and not that cold breeze hugging us. When Fred saw what I had prepared for him, his eyes opened widely and a huge smile appeared on his face.Still surprised, he turned around to look at me for a complete minute, keeping straight eye contact and sending tingles all over my body. With a devilish smirk on his face and the moonlight behind him, Fred shortened the distance between us, passing his arm around my waist to make our bodies touch and let me feel his corporal warmth. His face got closer again and he rubbed really slowly his nose with mine."You were right," he whispered with his look going from my lips to my eyes. "I fucking love it."Before letting me reply, his lips took mine in a demanding and passional way that made my knees a bit weak. I even had to hold back a little gasp as a tiny flame appeared inside my body when he touched me.Oh, Freddie...

I broke the kiss, because I didn't want to let it escalate so quickly, and looked at Fred straight in the eyes, with his hands still around my waist."Don't hurry up that much, Freddie, we have all the time in the world.""Are you saying I'm gonna have all of you for me the whole night?" he whispered, with the little sparks shining in his eyes sending tingles all over my body and making me already feel weak."Maybe..."He clicked his tongue, amused, and turned around to examine closely the things on the floor, sitting on the blanket and grabbing the champagne bottle. I followed him and sat in front of him with the view surrounding us. While I took the glasses to serve us a drink, Fred's eyes focused on the beautiful view of the mountains and the black lake being covered by the starry sky we had before us."I think I'm seeing one of the constellations..." he announced in a whisper, pretty stunned by the view. I lifted my eyes briefly, following his to quickly distinguish the brightest star."That's the Canis Maior constellation, the brightest star is the one Sirius is named after," I said in a little murmur, putting some of the food closer to him so he could pick whatever he wanted. "If I'm not wrong, the Orion constellation is closer to that one."Fred looked back at me genuinely surprised."How do you know all that?""I took Astronomy for five years." I snorted, obvious."What did you got in the OWL?"I tightened my lips. I don't like bragging about my marks."An Exceeds Expectations..."He rolled his eyes with a little smirk on his face. "Of course you did, you smart-arse.""Oh, shut up!" I pushed him slightly making him chuckle. "It's not like you aren't a bloody swot as well even though you try to pretend you aren't.""Wait, what?!" Fred burst into laughter, grabbing two grapes and throwing them in the air to catch them in his mouth. "Lilith, I got three OWLs. I'm many things, but a swot isn't one of them.""OWLs don't dictate how smart you are. You and George are better in Charms and Potions than what you want to admit.""Not at all..." he snickered again."Yes, you are. You passed those two OWLs which were incredibly difficult and I still remember how you beat me at Charms in Third Year.""Bah! But I can't beat you at Potions.""Of course you're not going to beat me at Potions, Fred. But aside from the exams, your in-class tasks are always between the top ones and Snape has never made you repeat a potion. Don't think I haven't noticed.""You are gonna make me blush..." he giggled again, looking genuinely flattered. "Georgie and I are used to having people telling us we're a waste of brain cells."I scowled. "C'mon, not all the intelligence is academic."Fred took a deep breath and turned around to let himself lay with his head resting on my lap, my hand went straight to caress his hair, slowly and with more affection than what I really wanted to show."You know where you are a complete smart-arse? At pranks." I continued, making him snicker proudly. "I don't know anyone in the world, besides you and George, who can have such a mind for that.""That's my biggest brag, darling," tickling my neck, making me laugh."Yeah, I think I'll never forget when you sneaked that salamander that spat fire in my Quidditch uniform in Fourth Year." I raised my eyebrow, staring at him while grabbing a strawberry and putting it in between his lips as he caught it slowly, with his eyes on me."Still don't know how you managed to do it.""A gentleman never tells..." he smiled, ironic."Well, then this lady will have to keep the present she got for you to herself."Fred opened his eyes widely."Present? There's more?!"I snorted, laughing. "Of course there's more! Go get the little bag and take out what is in there."With a kinda childish and excited smile, he raised himself and picked what I told him. As soon as he saw what it was, he let out a nervous chuckle. The happiness and illusion in his face were so easy to read that it melted a little bit my heart."How did you know I wanted one of these muggle things?!" Fred questioned, surprised, examinating the Polaroid in his hands."Heard it from a little birdie," I winked at him."Is that little birdie called George?" he grinned, still admiring the object."Who knows?" I shrugged, letting it obvious I wasn't going to tell him who it was. "By the way, you don't need to configure it. I enchanted it so it's ready for you to use it, but the photos are still muggle-style.""Bloody hell, Lilith! Thank you so much!" he kissed my cheek, still excited. I discreetly caressed the place where he left the kiss, surprised since it was the first time he gave me such an intimate and pure show of affection. "Wicked! Come here, I wanna try it!"Before I could say anything, he grabbed my waist and pulled me closer to him. Fred stretched out his long arm to make sure the two of us fitted in the picture and with a huge smile on his face and me sticking my tongue out to the camera, he pressed the button and the photo came out."Leave it on the floor while it develops," I advised him and he nodded, putting it carefully, as if it was going to break, against the little bag where we put the food left."Is this the first time you use one?" I asked him, actually curious."Yes, mum owns an old camera but it's enchanted. I always wanted to use a muggle one to see how they were. What about you?""Liv has one too so she let me use hers.""I saw one of the pictures hanging on your dorm's wall," he nodded. "You were with Olivia but both of you looked really little...""Yeah, that one is from when I used to spend some weeks in Ireland with Liv and Luna during summer. We're both thirteen in that picture.""Fuck, we've come so far from our thirteens, haven't we?""Definitely," I snickered, quite obvious."But if you want me to be honest and confess something - I had already my eyes on you.""Oh, believe me, I could tell! Have you forgotten you spent our previous six years here bothering and messing with me as much as you could? I still dunno why I never kicked your ass for behaving like a dickhead with me."He laughed, giving another sip of the champagne and I stood up to stretch my legs and approach the parapet to have a better view of the starry sky and catch the fresh air from the night breeze. Soon, I felt Fred's arms surrounding me and his breathing next to my ear as his warm touch contrasted with the air. I couldn't help but close my eyes when I felt him leaving soft and short kisses forming a line from my earlobe to my chin."Even then, I couldn't keep my eyes away from you. Yes, we hated each other, deeply, but still, I couldn't help but feel attracted to you. You, so breathtakingly beautiful and such an attitude, tempting me so much..." his hands sneaked slowly below my shirt and caressed my abdomen softly, moving his lips to my neck which I exposed to him. "Even though I hated myself for it, every time you were in the same room as me, you had my entire attention, Lilith.""Freddie...""What?" he whispered, amused, in my ear, grabbing my neck to make me look at him without changing our position. "Are you finally going yo let me touch you?"Yes, touch me, please.""As you wish, darling," his hands went below my bra to cup my breasts as he made my hips crash against the petrous barrier. "You remember you told me the first time you touched yourself thinking about me was after the Ball? The first time I did it thinking about you was after our Quidditch match in Year Five. I had already tried to hold in that fucking eager desire I felt for your pretty face, but it reached a point where every time we argued, I couldn't think of anything else but to get on my knees and eat you out until you had learnt how to properly behave with me"Fuck, I could already feel my underwear soaked against me. I grabbed one of his hands and slowly made it go down my body until it reached the start of my uniform skirt, but he snickered without moving his hand. Teasing me, as usual."You can't imagine the number of times I've pictured you naked and moaning my name as I fucked you slowly till you couldn't take it anymore - all only for me. And when I finally got to fuck you for the first time, I almost couldn't believe you were better than in my fantasies."I turned around to face him, already feeling my blood turning into a fire and all my body craving him madly. Before he could speak again, I covered his lips with mine and surrounded his hips with my legs making him almost lose his balance as he tried to cup my bum to keep me glued to his body. He tried to claim control of the kiss but I refused to, biting his lip and taking my hand to his hair to pull him closer to me. I could feel him snickering in between the kiss.I put my feet back to the floor and pushed him away from me, taking my hands to my tie before his eager eyes and his deep messy breathing."Sit down," I ordered him, starting to unbutton my shirt. He raised one of his eyebrows but obeyed, biting his tongue, with a mischievous smile on his face.Once my shirt was off, I pulled down quickly my skirt observing how Fred's eyes covered my body from up to down, completely, as his tongue ran through his lips. His piercing eyes on me, the moonlight bathing my skin and the fresh air touching it, sent tingles straight in between my legs."Come here, darling," Fred ordered with a soft voice but firm tone, leaning on his hands, indicating he wanted me straddling his lap. I bit my lip smiling and giving him a feline look.Before his curious look, I gave a few steps in his direction, standing right in front of his feet and taking my arms to the clasp of my bra. Fred's expression changed into pure desire and a slightly open mouth. Keeping my slow movements, it was my knickers' turn to fall to the floor, leaving me completely naked at his sight. His stare covered unhurriedly every place in my skin that was exposed him. The longing and passion shined in his eyes, piercing and catching me, as the stars reflected on them and a smirk appeared on his face."Bloody hell, woman..." Fred murmured. Then biting his lower lip, he slowly leaned fully back against the blanket, staring at my body. Devouring me with his eyes, he used one of his arms as a pillow while taking the other one straight to his trousers, to caress himself over the thin fabric that let me know pretty well how hard he already was.I got on my knees and crawled above his body, making our faces stay pretty close, rubbing my nose against his as our chests were glued but keeping my hips from touching his.My eyes went straight to his mouth and taking one of my hands to his neck, putting a bit of pressure, I kissed him, swallowing a little moan that escaped from his lips. As I got more comfortable on top of Fred, I took off his tie and his shirt, caressing his warm skin on the way and leaving slow and wet kisses all over his body. He tilted his head back when I reached his neck and sucked softly, one of his hands kept stroking his dick over the trousers and the other one went to caress the curve of my back."Lilith..." he let out a long sigh, closing his eyes when I bit the sensitive skin of his neck."What do you want?" I purred, in his ear as I let my hand travel down his abdomen."You. I want you," Fred lifted his hips trying uselessly to come into contact with the wetness in between my legs, which was silently begging for him."Do you want me to ride you, Freddie?" I murmured staring at his needy look. His breathing was already erratic and he was going to hurt his lip if he kept biting it that rough."Yes, I fucking need it," he whispered and I loved how he was letting me have the control. Smiling, I made a path of wet kisses from his collarbones to his hips where I sucked leaving pretty lovebites that probably would last a good couple of days, hearing him trying to hold back his moans and emitting muffled pants.I unbuttoned his trousers and quickly pulled them down along with his boxers, letting him completely naked, just like me, looking bloody divine. The tip of his dick was already red, demanding my attention and Fred let out a relieved sigh once he was free from the tightness of his clothes. Looking straight at his eyes, I stroke him painfully slowly, making him tilt his head back again and speak gibberish in whispers. I ran my tongue from the base to the top at the same velocity and then, sucked his tip as I kept stroking him.He let out a laboured moan with my name and his free hand went straight to pull my hair and make me take more of him. Giving one last long and slow lick all over his dick, I went back to my previous position, with my legs at each side of his hips. I rubbed myself against him, letting him feel how wet I was and making me already moan and noticing the throbbing in my clit."Fuck, you're so soaked..." he whispered, staring at the movement of my hips against his, taking his hands there to guide my movement and caress me."You make me like this," I replied raising my hips a little bit, using my hand to guide him to my entrance."Oh, darling...""Happy birthday, Freddie," with the burning eye contact, I let myself fall, making him bury his dick in my inside, stretching me and filling me.We both moaned at the same time and tilted our heads back to let us enjoy and feel fully the sensation. After I adjusted to his size, I put one of my hands in his neck to mark more my movements, letting him go in and out of me in a hypnotic rhythm."Fuck, Freddie, you feel so good..." I cried out, closing my eyes and accelerating gradually as the thrusts became harder and deeper. I struggled to have him completely inside of me but the mixture of pain and pleasure drove me crazy.He smiled, with his messy breathing and his hands digging in my hips. "My pretty little slut loves to ride me, don't you, darling?"I smiled back at him making my movements faster, gaining a loud moan from him. His hands went to cup my bum, guiding me, as he made me lower myself to catch my nipple in between his lips, giving me chills that went straight to my clit. A little whine left my lips and his mouth moved to my neck to bite and kiss all over. The heat surrounded the room and we didn't even care about Scotland's cold night air, we were already burning each other.My eyes met the champagne bottle, which was halfway, and a brief idea crossed my mind. Still riding Fred, making sure I was taking as much of him as I could and with his pants and muffled whimpers as bewitching melody, I reached the bottle and took a short sip under Fred's curious eyes, to then smirk devilishly and pour a little bit of the expensive drink on the sensitive skin of his neck, licking it."Fuck, Lilith!" he moaned, grabbing my bum harder to take the control of the thrusts and start fucking me rougher. I chuckled getting interrupted by my own moan. I took another sip and when I saw how Fred opened his mouth with his eyes on mine, letting pretty clear what he wanted, I put my hand back to his neck and pressed to then let out slowly the drink from my lips into his, like a waterfall. He swallowed it with a smile and made his pounding rougher and noisier as the tingles and pressure concentrated in my pussy.Damn, he was going to kill me.Letting out another hoarse and raspy moan, I noticed how he made me leave the bottle next to his face to then pass his arm around my waist to turn me around and leave me under him, switching the position. I opened my legs more to give him more space and kissed his jaw, making him pant hard. One of his hands was next to my face and the other one was in my hip, making sure he was pushing hard enough to leave me pleasantly dizzy."Freddie..." I whimpered against his lips. He smiled and the hand next to me went straight to my neck, making me slightly shake under him because of how turned on I was.Fred took the bottle again and poured a little bit more over my collarbones and my breasts, lowering himself to lick it from me as his thrusts kept going rough and fast. Then, he poured over my lips a little bit more and kissed me messily, drowning his own moans in my mouth and swallowing mine, with our exhausted breathes mixing.The sound of his hips crashing against mine and him hitting already in that spot that made me so weak, I pulled his body even closer to mine to hug him as I felt myself clenching around him with an intense orgasm hitting me hard, drying my throat and making me close my eyes. A strong electric current covered my body as every one of my nerves exploded with pure pleasure."You look so fucking beautiful when you cum for me, darling... I can't get enough of it," Fred whispered catching my face in his hand and whispering against my lips. I thought he was going to slow down his thrusts but giving me a mischievous and devilish smirk, he put his two hands on my hips, holding them still against the blanket and started to hit even harder and faster than before, making it even rougher and gaining a loud cry of pleasure from me. The sound was hypnotic and I could feel him moan even more, with his dick still throbbing and pulsating inside of me."Freddie, I-" my own moan interrupted me, making me feel my legs trembling and my body incredibly overstimulated. His eyes went from where our bodies were connecting to mine, amused and mischievous, with that deep and erratic breathing."Take it, Lilith. I know you can, darling. Take it like the good girl you are for me," Fred murmured, groaning against my mouth.My nails dug in his back, making him moan and whimper out loud, as I felt another orgasm covering me. It felt harder and more intense than before, with my legs shaking and my pussy tightening even more around his dick, with my throat hurting because of how much I had moaned."Fred!" I murmured, feeling at the peak of my own climax with goosebumps covering my entire body. I tilted my head back, noticing how Fred imitated me, exposing his neck as he came hard inside of me with a last raspy and loud moan, looking so bloody good that I felt I was fucking a Greek god.Our eyes met while we caught air and we couldn't help but smile. He pulled out of me and laid by my side. Running his hand through his hair he let out another chuckle, trying to normalize his breathing."Fuck, that was so good..." he murmured, with his eyes staring at the ceiling and a dreamy smile.I giggled, nodding, and giving a quick gaze to the picture resting over the little bag. I grabbed it to have a closer look and couldn't help but have my heart racing as soon as I observed it.There we were, the two of us in the picture, incredibly close to each other, with our happy faces and the whole starry night view behind us. It was quite cute, intimate and even though I wanted to think we looked like friends, we didn't. We looked like something more, and that scared the fuck out of me. But I played it cool because I didn't want to ruin the moment with my brainwasher mind.I looked at Fred from the corner of my eye and he had a proud smile on his face as he rested his head over one of his arms."We look bloody good, innit?"I smiled arrogantly at him, making my own thoughts go silent. "Yes, we do."

After spending the rest of the night chatting - because I was afraid to fall asleep and having Fred witnessing my nightmares- and every once in a while silently observing the starry night, at the start of the dusk we picked up our things and left the Astronomy tower as if nothing had happened to then sneak back into our common rooms. Luckily, none of the professors was up yet and the ghosts seemed to be wandering in other places.When I got into my common room, before getting into my dorm, a perfect idea appeared in my mind. It was the perfect time for the Crabbe and Goyle prank.I applied myself a silencing spell and managed to sneak into Draco's dorm which he shared with his two bully-boys and Blaise. Even though I couldn't make any sound, my heartbeat hit against my chest because of the adrenaline but Crabbe's snore probably would have covered me even without the spell. Once I got in front of their wardrobe, I opened their side and left Blaise's and Draco's clothes intact but to the other boys' clothes, I silently applied a Diffindo to cut all their trousers and leave them all - including the Quidditch ones - tore. I also applied another spell that didn't allow anyone to fix the Diffindo.Getting out of their dorm, carefully, I got rid of the silencing spell and went once and for all back to my room, sleeping almost all the rest of the morning with a pleasant burning in between my legs and the memory of Fred and I's picture.I woke up in time for my last class of the day; Charms. When I got inside the class, I noticed that the girl who used to sit by my side was missing. Not giving it too much importance, I took out my book and wand out of my bag and prepared everything before Flitwick arrived. The subject of Charms was, along with DADA in the past and Potions thanks to Severus, one of my biggest academic strengths and even though I skipped some classes, I could catch up easily and remain as one of Flitwick's favourite students in my course.As the professor entered the room giving his little steps to his desk, I noticed someone sitting in the seat next to me. My eyes opened widely when I noticed it was Fred.What is he doing?"What are you doing here?" I whispered to him, carefully, noticing Flitwick had already started his class.Fred gave me an ironic smile. "Attending class? I passed the OWL in Year 5, mate."I clicked my tongue at his obvious response, "I mean what are you doing next to me.""George has Herbology and Lee is making some business, I don't like sitting alone," he raised one of his eyebrows, with a little smile on his face. "And I think I saw your mate Zabini snogging the girl who usually sits here, they're probably gettin' their end away by now."Blaise was having a lot of fun this year, innit."You better not distract me," I warned him, going back to write what Flitwick had noted on the blackboard."What a low opinion you've got of me, beautiful. I'll never do anything to bother you when you're being a wee swot. I already distracted you enough yesterday, didn't I?" he snickered, full of sarcasm, making me snort trying to hold back my smile."Weasley, I hope you are not distracting one of my best students..." Flitwick called him, making Fred's smile bigger."I'm not, professor.""He was only asking me for a word he didn't understand, professor. He's not bothering me." I replied and the little man nodded, continuing with his class."Oh, Arambella defending me? Bloody hell, I must be dreaming..." Fred whispered again, taking his quill to note down what Flitwick had written."Bah, don't be such a daft. And let me listen to Flitwick, for Merlin's sake.""As you command, darling," he smiled and kept silent.I thought I would finally concentrate on the theory the professor was giving us, but a few minutes after, my mind and my entire body could only focus on Fred by my side. He was listening and even taking notes in his messy handwriting, but I was noticing every single thing he was doing; his measured breathing, the sound of his quill, the veins in his hands, the rings I gave him in his fingers, every time he licked his lips... His smell of powder and shampoo was overwhelming me and for a moment, in the depth of my mind, I longed for his touch.I shook my head discreetly and grabbed my quill firmly, crossing my legs, ready to focus once and for all. I was almost finishing copying when I noticed Fred's knee hitting mine, I looked at him scowling but he had his eyes on the professor as he was chewing gum with a slight smirk on his face, making his jawline sharper. I snorted and got back to my work but it didn't pass a minute when a big hand rested on the naked skin of my thigh. Obviously, it was Fred's hand.He didn't look at me again, actually, he seemed so unbothered and relaxed while his touch was making my blood pressure accelerate. Unintentionally, I let out a long sigh. His hand remained there for the rest of the class, warming my cold skin, not moving, but giving every once in a while a slight caress with his thumb. By the end of the lecture, when we were getting ready to go outside, I cheered silently when he stood up ready to leave and, at the same time, cursed myself for feeling so sensitive before him.Fuck, I was already wet and he had only touched my leg. How can he have such an effect on me?After having lunch in the Hall at the Slytherin table next to Draco and Blaise - watching how Goyle and Crabbe were missing - I went straight to the Room of Requirement, accompanied by Liv and Luna."Harry said today we're doing the Patronus, right?" Liv asked George once we got inside the room and found him, chatting with Lee, Angelina and Fred. The four of them quickly opened their circle, inviting us silently to join them.Fred winked at me as soon as the girls and I walked in their direction, and I had to bit my inner cheek not to smile."Yeah, think he said so last week. You already know what's yours?""I do, 's a hound," she said, showing him proudly the necklace I gave her that she still wore. "Yours?""A magpie. What about yours, ladies?" George said focusing on Luna and me."I don't know yet, but I have a feeling it might be a rabbit," Luna smiled, playing with the bracelet on her wrist, handmade by Liv."Last time I checked mine's a German Sheppard,""Hang on, you're telling me you and Liv are best friends and both of you have a dog as your Patronus? Blimey, and they say Fred and I are the weird ones..." George giggled, looking at his twin."Oh, shut up, Georgie, at least ours are not the same kind of dogs.""Fair enough," the ginger lifted his hands, giving up."Have you heard what happened to Malfoy's friends early in the morning?" Angelina spoke, with surprise on her face. " I heard Crabbe and Goyle couldn't get out of dungeons. Still don't know why, though.""Malfoy mentioned something about a stupid prank and tried to blame us Gryffindors but none of us can get into the bloody Slytherin common room," Lee replied, crossing his arms with an amused expression on his face. "If we could, the Slytherins' lives would have been miserable. Sorry, Lilith." He giggled and I rolled my eyes, smiling.No Gryffindor before Fred had ever entered my common room and I doubt any of them was going to do it ever again."I know what happened to them." I snickered, devilishly, staring at my nails."Really? Go on, tell us!""Someone cut every single one of their trousers and now they can't get out of the common room because they're in their underwear.""Who did it?! It had to be another Slytherin, so you have to know..."A mischievous smile appeared on my face and I pretended to look at the ceiling and everyone seemed to understand."Wait, was it you?! Bollocks, Lilith!" Lee chuckled, giving a little jump. "Didn't know you had a mind for pranks."George and Liv snorted laughing and Fred looked at me surprised while Angelina shook her head giggling."Well, if none of you wasn't doing anything against them, someone had to, am I wrong?""You know what, Lilith? I think you're my favourite Slytherin."I crossed my arms in front of my chest and smiled. "Of fucking course I am, Georgie."Once we were all ready to start the class, Harry called us and made us make a little circle around him to explain what the Patronus was and how to make the enchantment, then asked us to practice it as much as we could.Since forming a corporeal Patronus required a lot of energy and Harry wanted us to practice them against each other later, I was content with making the incorporeal blue light appear, controlling it all over the room. Potter agreed and focused more on the people who had never done a Patronus to make them form a corporeal one. I saw Luna's hare - her prediction wasn't that wrong after all -, Ginny with her horse, Cho's swan and Hermione's otter.Ron's Jack Russell Terrier almost trespassed me and the poor boy gave me a scared look."Blimey, I'm terribly sorry, Lilith. Did it hurt you?""Not a bit, mate, don't worry." I smiled at him and his expression relaxed, giving me a nod.Then, I saw Neville still struggling with his incorporeal Patronus."I'm so useless..." he sighed, giving up."You aren't, Nev. Have you forgotten this enchantment is one of the most difficult ones to perform? Give yourself a bit of room, you'll end up getting it, I know it." I caressed his back and he let appear a little smile."How long did it take you to get it?""It took me two years before I got it thanks to Professor Lupin, and nowadays I still struggle with it sometimes. My uncle was raging because I wasn't even able to even make it get out of my wand..."He felt a little bit better and thanked me, leaving a little kiss on my cheek and blushing a little bit. I gave him a hug and caressed his back again to show him my support. Neville was one of the purest souls I've ever met and sometimes I wished Draco was more like him and less of a Malfoy. Everything would have been easier."Fine, everyone, make a circle, we are going to practice them against each other. Luna, would you mind practice it against Smith?" Harry asked, calling our attention.I got in the front row, watching how Luna's hare was way superior to Smith's incorporeal one, which annoyed him way more than expected, probably because he considered Luna inferior to him.Then, George's magpie gave a funny loop with Finnigan's fox and Lee Jordan's lion played with Liv's hound."Ok, the last one..." Harry interrupted after his stag came back to him. "Lilith and...Fred."Of fucking course, who else could it be? Bloody hell...The two of us walked at the same time to each of the corners, while the rest of the group kept chatting between them about their own Patronus. Liv, Hermione, George and Lee were the ones paying us attention. I pretended to be calm and confident and Fred had an amused smile on his face as he ran his fingers through his hair.With his brown shiny eyes fixed on mine and adapting the most correct posture for the enchantment, his voice mixed with mine as we said the words at the same time;"Expecto Patronum,"Two incorporeal lights got out of our wands and flew slowly almost reach the ceiling. The two Patronus fused together in a huge and bright ball of light.Getting slowly down, the ball ended up in front of us, illuminating the room and finally breaking back into the two lights which went back to us.But what I saw entering my wand made me freeze in my place and I felt my soul leaving my body.A magpie entered in my wand. Not a German Sheppard.I could feel how the blood abandoned my face and how my breathing became more erratic and laboured.No, that could not be possible. It must be a mistake.

But the Patronus never mistakes its owner. Never.I looked at Liv and Hermione, the two of them had their eyes and mouths opened widely as they stared at me while the rest seemed to not notice what just had happened. Starting to feel a bit dizzy and having every nerve in my body running high, my eyes went straight to Fred.He was talking with his brother, who was patting his back, calmly and with that little smile still on his face. He seemed pretty relaxed and calm so I deduce, luckily for me, he didn't see what had happened.Bloody hell, I was so fucked up.I saw how Fred snickered and licked his lips when Lee punched his arm, joking. How he ran his finger through his hair again making his shirt tighter around his arm, and how he played with his wand in his hand, with the sunlight hitting his skin, making it almost golden and marking his little and almost unnoticeable freckles and moles. I felt myself melting at his view.I couldn't deny it anymore.I am in love with Fred Weasley.

I didn't have any more time left to think about my feelings towards Fred because I and the entire rest of the DA got in big trouble.Umbridge had caught us because one of Cho's friends snitched. I was absolutely pissed off.When the big door from the Room of Requirement exploded, we found the old pink bitch staring at us with satisfaction, accompanied by Filch and the Inquisitorial Squad, including Draco who looked at me as if I had betrayed him.Of course, all of us silently agreed not to reveal the truth about our encounters even though Umbridge took all of us to confront Dumbledore and the Minister himself to inform him about the punishment we were going to get. Poor Harry was dragged to the front row to take all the blame. Fucking hell, I still wanted to curse that bitch.Fudge tried to confront Dumbledore very heatedly when the old man surprisingly, took the blame, naming himself the founder of the group and saying he was the one who planned everything. While the Minister was arguing with him, who remained calm, I recognised Percy Weasley standing along with Kingsley.My eyes went straight to look at Fred and I found him a couple of steps away from me, glaring at his older brother. I knew they never had a close bond because of how different they were, but after learning how Percy rejected his family and felt embarrassed for them as well as tried to brand Harry as a liar, their relationship became even colder and distant.Umbridge gave us detention for an entire week and I could already imagine the quill's sharp tip getting in my skin. Fuck my life. Harry swallowed hard but showed himself confident, ready to take it since it wasn't his first time either. Some of the others flinched and gasped, looking daggers every once in a while at Cho's friend.When I was getting out of the office, ready to go to my dorm and forget anybody else existed, I noticed someone grabbing my wrist."I think you and I have something to talk about.""Bugger off, Draco!" I tried to get rid of his grip."Not until you explain what the fuck did this mean.""What do you want me to explain? That Harry offered me to learn the proper magic I wanted to learn and that Umbridge forbid us to practice? I did, yes, in case you've forgotten I'm a bloody witch, I like to practice magic. That's it.""Why didn't you tell me? Where's your Slytherin's loyalty?" he scowled, actually annoyed."I told you I wouldn't trust you until you had stopped behaving like Umbridge's lapdog and look what I have earned anyway. And you dare to talk to me about Slytherin's loyalty? Do you think just because you don't take points from us you're behaving like a real Slytherin? Nah, mate. Now, leave me alone, I have things to do.""You're mad at me without reason! It was that Ravenclaw girl's friend who told Umbridge!""I don't even care about that anymore. You're the one who joined the Inquisitorial Squad even though you knew how much Umbridge has fucked me up. But 's fine, Draco, let's it aside. I don't want to argue with you and I'm madder at Umbridge than at anybody else."He snorted again, running his fingers through his hair. " I can try talking to her. Convince her to annul the detention for you.""No.""Why not?!" Draco asked, starting to feel desperate."Because it wouldn't be fair for the rest of the group. I was as involved in it as the rest of them. I owe some loyalty, especially to Hermione and Liv.""Lilith-""I don't wanna talk right now, Draco. I have to get ready to open my bloody hand tomorrow in the evening."I got inside the dungeons and went straight to my dorm, laying face down on my bed and playing some music as I continued braiding a bracelet I was planning to send for Tonks, following the technique Liv taught me. Lately, both braiding and knitting had become an unusual way to keep my rage under control since I didn't have my broom back yet, leaving Quidditch out of the table.After a little while, I heard someone knocking on my door. Liv appeared in my sight as soon as I shouted 'come in' and, without words needed, she threw herself in my bed, laying next to me, looking at the ceiling."I think we have something to talk about."I complained, grunting and messing up one of the knots in the bracelet. "Not you too, I already had Draco being a pain in the ass.""You know what I want to talk to you about is really far from whatever Draco said."She was damn right. As usual."Bet you wanna talk about Fred.""What happened before Umbridge caught us-""Innit!" I snickered at the same time as she started to talk. Noticing I was only ruining more the bracelet, I left it on my nightstand and focused on Liv."You can't deny it to yourself anymore, Lilith. It's not good for your mental health and it's stupid to do it. The sooner you learn to accept it, the sooner it would stop being heavy on your heart.""How d'you know it's been like that?" I asked her, genuinely surprised."For fuck's sake, don't be such a gobdaw, I know you even better than yourself.""Can't deny that.""What happened today with your Patronus- Merlin, it was the bombshell you needed to admit it. There's nothing wrong with being in love with him, Lilith."I let out a long sigh."'Course there is it, Liv. I am in love with the man that hated me the most for these last six years. And it's not a poor teenage love, my bloody Patronus has changed into his! You know how fucking much I have to be feeling for him to reach that point?!""Lilith, you know that something changed between you two after this summer...""Yeah, I became a fuckin' masochist who falls in love with her Nemesis! And what's worse, he doesn't love me back!" I grabbed my pillow and snorted dramatically against it. "The last thing I needed now was to have a bloody heartbreak.""You don't know that..." she whispered."I dunno what?""If he loves you back or not!""Of course I do. He doesn't love me back, I know it. He might be attracted to me or maybe even like me as a friend, but love?! Nah, Liv."She tutted, shaking her head. "You don't know it. Whether you see it or not, I truly reckon he must feel else something for you.""How do you know it?" I asked, trying to sound confident and firm, even though internally, I was deadly scared. I have never been actually in love, and only thinking about the idea of confessing it to Fred and finding out he doesn't feel the same for me, made me sick and feel a huge hole in my chest. Why does everything happen always to me?"Because I've seen how he looks at you!" she stated, pretty obvious."With sexual desire?" I asked, sarcastic and Liv rolled her eyes."With affection, Lilith! Look, I don't know if it's love or not, I don't know if his Patronus changed too or not, but I do know he has to feel something for you. I just simply know."I clicked my tongue and started playing with my nails, trying to clarify my own thoughts."I just don't want to create false hopes for myself, Liv. I already told you what I think about falling in love.""And I understand it, but you can't forbid you from feeling. You don't need anyone to succeed nor to complete you, but being in love is one of the most beautiful feelings in the world, Lilith. Don't punish yourself for feeling it and learn to experience it and to love the version of you that it's going to let out. It's better than keep swallowing it and hiding it from yourself."I sighed hard again, considering her words."I'm not going to confess it to him, though.""I know you aren't.""And you better not let out a word about it!""My mouth is shut. Promise."✵ ✵ ✵I considered more than once whether to attend my last class of the day on my way to Charms, but since Professor Flitwick already saw me earlier in the corridor, I had no other option. When we got in front of the classroom, the little man interrupted us before we could get inside."I'm terribly sorry but today's class won't be taking place here since Professor Umbridge has required our classroom," he announced, trying to hold back uselessly the despise he felt for the new headmistress. Yes, headmistress, what a fucking nightmare. "Instead, Professor McGonagall has offered us her place and luckily, this session will be theoretical as well, so, please, follow me."Everyone did so and quickly, we got inside the empty classroom, which still had some Transfiguration notes from Year 5 on the blackboard. I was planning to sit in one of the middle rows, but a hand surrounded mine, dragging me into the last one.As soon as I felt his touch, the memory of yesterday hit me hard and stupid butterflies appeared in my stomach. I hate it here."Come, sit with me, Lilith," Fred murmured with an amused smile, guiding me to sit at our shared desk, with one of the windows by my side and the two of us being the only ones in the entire row."Again? Where's Lee?" I asked, trying to keep the calm tone, ignoring the pounding in my chest."Business," he simply said, getting his parchment and his quill out of his bag and starting to take notes from the blackboard.I gave up, imitating him and putting all my effort into focusing on the class. I noticed how every five minutes, Fred moved in his seat and looked through the window or stared at the entire room, or played with the quill in his hands, or chewed his gum, or left the quill down to pick it up again a minute later. It looked as if he couldn't remain still, but anyways, giving a quick gaze to his notes I saw he was catching everything.The lesson started to be boring when Flitwick was revising one of the basic charms I already learnt in the past with Remus - whenever he sneaked some of his Charms notes into my DADA ones - so I moved a bit in my seat, getting more comfortable as I leaned back in my chair and opened a bit my legs.I noticed how Fred's eyes focused on me for a brief moment but I managed not to look back at him and pretend I was actually listening to Flitwick. Not even three minutes went by when I felt the ginger's hand on my leg again, giving a dim and almost unnoticeable caress.Once again, I tried to ignore it and focus, attempting to grab my quill and write again even though my hands were slightly trembling. I couldn't even write down a word when Fred's hand got slowly up, touching my inner thigh, getting closer to where my body was already craving him."What are you doing?" I whispered, making him look at me from the corner of his eye, smiling."I'm getting bored..." he replied as if it was pretty obvious."And what do I have to do with it? Stare at the wall or something, I dunno." I complained, taking his hand from me. He snickered with that raspy and muffled voice, sending quivers all over my body."C'mon, darling, I know you're bored too. Don't you wanna have some fun before we see Umbridge later?"I let out a long sigh and he gave a quick gaze to Flitwick, who was still explaining far away from us, as he got even closer to me to whisper on my ear, taking advantage of the other students in the front rows covering us;"Let me please you a little bit, Lilith."He got back into his place, chewing his gum as if nothing had happened, and sneaked his hand back into my thigh to squeeze, this time getting way too up, till the point his pinkie was touching my underwear under my uniform skirt.I couldn't help but take my hands discreetly to my mouth and whisper "Fuck," hearing him chuckle silently.His hand moved out of the way my panties and his fingers caressed me completely, creating a path from my entrance to my clit, making me bite my lip not to produce any sound. I gave Fred a quick look and he had his eyes right there where his hand disappear under my clothes, as he was biting his lip as well with a devilish smile on his face and a bit of heavy breathing."Keep it quiet, darling," he drawled in a low whisper that made me close my eyes briefly as his fingers moved "As much as I love hearing you moan, I want to keep it for myself."Luckily for us, there was quite a distance from our desk to the other one in front of us, so it was almost impossible for anyone to hear us, even though I could have sworn that my heart beating was even louder than Flitwick's voice in the background.His thumb started to do soft slow circles in my clit as his index and middle finger got soaked when he let them go inside of me. I had to take my hand discreetly to my mouth to silence me and my breathing as it became more laboured and shallow.His touch on me felt so burning and so pleasant that I had the need to tilt my head back and just enjoy the sensation."Freddie..." I couldn't help but whisper when his fingers twisted inside of me, making me slightly writhe in my seat."You can't cum until I let you, darling...""Says who?" I teased him, getting more confident. He put more pressure, getting his fingers deeper inside my pussy."Me."I put discreetly my hand over his trousers, noticing already the bulge in them. He looked down to where I was touching him and smiled, running his tongue through his lower lip and letting out a silent giggle."I don't obey you, Freddie," I whispered again, looking to the front and clenching a bit around his fingers, provoking myself to feel so vulnerable and sensitive."You're lucky my next creation isn't ready yet, dear. If I could, I'd sneak a vibrator under your pretty skirt and put it against your weakest spot, overstimulating you until you beg me to stop and I could start fucking you mercilessly, hearing those beautiful cries and moans as music to my ears. I'd erase that fucking attitude from you."I had to take a long breath in order not to gasp and show how weak his words made me."You love my attitude,"He raised his head a bit, looking quite proud of himself."I fucking adore it, " he moved more his fingers, a bit faster, making me pant into my mouth. "Now, be a good girl and take it until I say you can cum."My hips moved slightly trying to follow the movement of his hand and I had to take another long breath to keep myself calm."Ms Arambella, are you feeling okay? You look a bit disturbed..." Professor Flitwick called me, looking a bit concerned. I heard Fred snickering by my side and making the circles in my clit faster, as he put his eyes on me, pretending to look innocently concerned. As if he did not know damn well what he was doing.Fucking hell, he was going to end me."No, professor, I'm perfectly fine." I managed to say with a normal voice, swallowing hard."Great, if you start to feel a bit sick don't hesitate to tell me, a'right?" he said and I nodded, letting him continue with the class.Poor man, if he knew..."You're such a pretty mess, I can't believe how lucky I am to be the one ruining you like this..." Fred whispered in my ear.His hand kept playing with me while I tried to suffocate the sound coming out of my mouth by biting my lower lip, feeling my teeth digging in my skin. My head went a bit dizzy as my body discreetly almost reached the peak of my climax."Don't cum yet, Lilith..." Fred warned me with an amused tone, slowing down his movements.I let out a messy and incredibly muffled cry that got silenced by the surprising voices of the rest of the students when Flitwick showed them one of the most complex Charms to perform. Lucky me Remus already taught it to me during summer."Fred- please... fuck, I can't hold it anymore," I whispered leaning my back against the chair."Oh, no, I don't like it when you call me Fred, darling. Address me properly and I'll let you cum.""Bloody hell, stop teasing me- " I whined in another whisper."You know what to do," he interrupted me firmly, but still with his playful tone. "And I suggest doing it soon, the class is about to finish and I bet you don't want to be left without your orgasm."I swallowed hard, my heart hitting in my chest and every nerve in my body running high."Fuck, fine - Freddie, let me cum..." I gave up, giving him a looking at them from the corner of my eye to then bite my lip.He seemed pleased because he started to move again his fingers at the same velocity he did before, taking me quickly to the top of the rollercoaster, feeling his touch even more intimate and intense. I managed to stay completely silent as my blood felt like burning in my veins and my whole body exploded with pleasure."Cum around my fingers, darling," he whispered again, giving me chills. I put my hand in my mouth, biting my knuckles to make sure I remained quiet and managed to low my head so my forehead rested over the old wood from the desk as I came hard with Fred's intensity not being bearable anymore and his words rooting deeply in my mind and body.A minute after, Flitwick announced the class was over and everyone started to pick their things, getting ready to leave. Fred's smile appeared again and he discreetly took his hand from my skirt. With his eyes on mine, he took his fingers, which previously were inside of me, to his mouth and sucked them under my amazed and excited stare. He winked and approach me;"Good girl," he whispered, to then leave a single kiss on my cheek and start to walk away. Before disappearing in the corridor, he turned around to face me one last time;"See you later with Umbridge... bet that won't be as fun as Charms," he snickered arrogantly again and finally left, leaving me made a complete mess.I took my hand to my cheek and caress right there where he kissed me. Bloody butterflies. It didn't matter if I ... loved him - it was still hard for me to accept it -, I'd have my revenge for this even though I enjoyed it too bloody much.You played with the player herself, love.

The room got deadly quiet when Umbridge appeared in front of us with her annoying smile and superiority.She started a stupid speech about how incorrect and unacceptable our behaviour had been while all of us pretended to listen to her until she finally said the phrase we were going to have carved in our skin. I started to write it down, hearing already some of the grunts from the students who never had detention with Umbridge before and who were experiencing that sort of pain for the first time."Ms Arambella, " she called me, approaching my desk. "I reckon that your punishment has to be a little bit more disciplinary than the rest. You not only had the chance more than once to confess about what was happening but also you betrayed your House's loyalty;" she tutted, pretending to be offended. "I'm afraid you will have an extra sentence to... write down.""That's unfair!" Harry protested, glaring at Umbridge."You are just inventing excuses by now," George added, clicking his tongue."Shut up, everyone," the woman mumbled, drawling, still with her eyes on me. "Ms Arambella, I want you to write down 'I am the daughter of a Death Eater.' So you do not forget anymore where your actual place is."A cynic smile appeared on my face. This fucking bitch is tempting my patience..."You can't do that!" Liv protested, slamming the quill against the table."That has nothing to do with Dumbledore's Army," Fred spat. I wanted to turn around to look at him, but I was having a silent war of looks with Umbridge, challenging her, and I wasn't planning to lose it. "And you have no right to shame Lilith for who her mother is... Nobody should have ever had it."I could feel his eyes on my back, burning me, and I almost flinched in my seat at his words. Was this a weird way to apologise for everything in the past years?"If you make Lilith write that down-" Harry started, but I interrupted him."It's 'kay, lads. I'll do it, Merlin forbids if I ever forget who my family is, right Professor?" I smiled cynically again, playing with my quill between my hurt hand.She lowered herself to leave her face right in front of me and even though I wanted to step away from her, I remained firm."What would a half-breed whore know about family?" she whispered in my face, and I, mentally, keeping the exact face expression, started to imagine myself cursing her. She got back to her previous position. "You already heard me, Ms Arambella. Hope this teaches you discipline once and for all."Snorting a fake chuckle, I started to write down, trying not to focus on the words and keeping my mind in a complete blank. The last thing I wanted was to think about my mother.After an entire hour in which we kept silently opening our hands with the quills, that bitch finally let us go. I was feeling numb and a bit dizzy because of how much my two hands hurt but I was happy to know that I managed to keep my rage under control.As we were getting out of the room, Liv's hand surrounded mine, putting something in my hand."Why are you giving me this?" I questioned, looking at the little herb."It's camomille, it heals faster the wounds," she said, caressing her own hurt hand.I shook my head. "Liv, it's yours, you also need it.""I'm not the one with two wounds. Lilith, please ignore what that horrible woman said, your actual place is as far from the Death Eaters as possible. They're no longer part of you, actually, they never were.""I know, you don't have to worry.""I do because I know you too well and I know you'll be chewing that later. You have proved you are nothing like them, don't let her tell you otherwise.""Thank you, Liv." I kissed her cheek and hugged her tightly because if there was someone who had never disappointed me, that was Liv."Oli, wanna join us in the common room? Will ask Sprout for more healing herbs." One of the boys from Hufflepuff approached as he got out of the classroom.Olivia looked at me for a brief moment, silently asking me if I was okay."Go on, Liv, you need to heal that hand too."She nodded, taking my hands to leave a kiss on them and follow the Hufflepuff boy down the corridor.I was about to leave to my common room as well - I really needed to have a little nap and have time for myself, not to let myself fall in my own misery because I wasn't going to let Umbridge have that power over me - grabbing my wrist to try to make the hand pain numb and less intense, when I pictured the twins sitting in one of the benches with a boy younger than us. They were consoling him."See? It's fading already." George said in a soft whisper."You can't see ours anymore," Fred encouraged, speaking with a voice as soft as his brother's."And the pain stops after a while."Hearing the little boy's sobs really broke my heart. How could that woman hurt literal children with such medieval methods? I quickly got in front of the kid and kneeled to stay at his height."Hello, Michael," I started also lowering my voice and making it as soft and kind as possible. "Look, I have something for you." I opened my hand showing him the little herb Liv gave me. "This will help with the pain, it won't fade it completely, but I promise you it will be much more bearable. Why don't you take it?"The boy wiped out his tears with the sleeve of his sweater, red cheeks and watery eyes. "But she has hurt you twice," he stuttered, looking at my hands. I noticed the twins were also staring at them so I quickly hid them with my sleeves. Giving a little gaze at them, I found George looking at me with a bit of pity in his eyes and Fred literally staring right there where the fabric of my sweater covered the wounds."I'm okay, love, I'm sure you need it more than me."A faked cough filled the silence.Fuck my life.I felt my face completely changing as I turned around my head to see Umbridge at the classroom's door. I could notice my eyes throwing daggers at her and I deeply wished I had real daggers to literally do it."As I told you once before, Mr Potter," my eyes found Harry walking to get by my side, as the twins and I stood up slowly to get behind him. Working as some kind of shield for him. "Naughty children deserve to be punished."She gave us a last faked smile and went back inside."You know, George?" Fred started by my side, with a calm voice but a wild look in his eyes - a stare full of mischief and craving for revenge that I've never seen before, not even targeted at me -, "I've always felt our futures lay outside of the academic achievement.""Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing."Harry shook his head by my side, letting out a little snort."C'mon, Harry, let's go back to the common room," George said, passing an arm around Potter's shoulders as he made a sign to the other little boy to follow them."Go on, I'll catch you up later," Fred said, turning a bit around but with his eyes still where Umbridge disappeared from our sight."Okay. Lilith, if you need anything, don't doubt to tell me, a'right?" he said while attempting to smile but it stayed as tightening his lips. I nodded, thanking him."I'm terribly sorry for what Umbridge did to you," Harry finally spoke, looking at me with his big green eyes, genuinely meaning it. "And I tell you the same as George. Whatever you need."I gave a quick caress in his arm, "Don't worry, mate, and thank you. Take care, boys."As I stared at them leaving, feeling my body already nervous about staying completely alone with Fred for the first time since his birthday. Once the boys got out of our sights, I felt his hand going straight to my cheek to make me look at him, leaving a little caress."Wanna share a cig in the Garden, darling?" he asked, keeping the exact soft whisper he used with the boy.I nodded, with a very dim smile on my face. With his fingers touching mine, he guided me out in complete silence as the cold and grey fog created a mysterious but at the same time cosy ambience around us. We quickly got to which had started to become my favourite tree in the whole garden, and when I thought Fred was going to start climbing to get to the branch, as usual, he simply sat on the grass, letting his back lay against the trunk."Come here," he patted the space between his open legs, looking at me.My heart raced in my chest and I let out a kinda broken sigh that I hoped he didn't notice. Now that I was aware of my feelings for him, acts like that only made them burn more in my guts.I did so and put my legs over one of his as I let my head rest on his shoulder. While I took the pack of cigarettes as well as my lighter, I noticed Fred's hand sneaking slowly into my sweater to caress softly my waist and warm me more, feeling covered by his corporal heat. Every nerve in my body was jumping with pure happiness at having him this close to me.Without words needed, I took one of the cigs and put it in his lips, trying to disguise how I was staring at him, carving in my memory every single detail in his face; the little golden dots in his brown eyes, the almost unnoticeable few freckles spread in his cheeks and the three dispersed moles in his neck, the pink of his lips and the fluffiness in his ginger hair... Mentally slapping myself to stop staring at him like a creep, I lightened his cigarette carefully, observing how his jaw clenched to hold it between his lips, and how his Adam's apple moved as he took the first puff.Keeping the cig between his lips, he took one of his hand from under my sweater and grabbed another cig from my pack to put it in my lips. Before I could say anything, he took the lighter from my hand and, slowly, lightened my cig, with his eyes straight in mine. We both took a long puff and let the smoke out in each other lips, breathing it from us, with the only sound of the wind whistling, moving the tree's leaves, and our own breathings.Fred let out a long sigh, "How are your hands?"I shrugged, "Not as bad as they could be,"He tried to smile but it didn't reach entirely his face. "You know? When that woman said the sentence you had to write, I froze in my seat. I couldn't believe how she blamed you for who your mother is - but then," he swallowed hard, " I remembered I used to do the same. I used to blame you for Circe's crimes.""You never tortured me, Fred," I whisper, surprised by his words."No, but that doesn't excuse me," his eyes went back to mine. "I'm terribly sorry, Lilith, you can't imagine how much I regret it.""It's okay,""No -""Fred, it's okay. I don't care about that anymore. We both have changed a lot since then."He sighed again, giving up, but looking at me with his eyes full of unfree words that he seemed to crave to tell me, giving me chills all over my body."Are you cold?" Fred asked rhetorically to then grab my waist and pull me even closer to his body.We kept smoking in silence, with the melody of the wind and Fred humming really softly in the background. Even when we finished the cigs, we silently agreed to stay just like that. I thought my heart would race again, but instead, it calmed and got a peaceful and slow rhythm, erasing every kind of bad emotion in me."Let me see your hands, darling," Fred whispered after a while. A bit hesitant, I took my hands out of my sleeves and showed them to him. The scarlet blood was already dry, but the words were still pretty visible.Fred got them in his hand, while the other one still rested on my waist, and left soft kisses in the wounds. Kisses that gave me literal goosebumps because of the delicateness of his movements.When I noticed the wound in his as well, I got it between my hands and repeated his action. Feeling the warm and slightly rough touch of it against my lips, while my mind thought every word I was keeping for myself;I love you. One kiss. I love you. Another kiss. I love you...Instead of wording it, I looked at him and rubbed my nose against his, making him let out a little chuckle.With my head resting again in his shoulder, looking at the view of the forbidden forest in front of us, Professor Hagrid's hut and the grey water of the lake, I noticed Fred lightening another cig for him and leaning back in the tree's trunk, still with his caress on my waist.Maybe the day didn't end up that bad after all.

During the next couple of days, my entire attention focused on studying for my NEWTs and, since 'Mione, Ron and Harry were also occupied with their OWLs, we spent a lot of time at the library with tones of coffee and books. Things seemed to go back to normality — as normal as two weeks full of exams could be — and I even went back to talking to Draco and be as close as we used to.I knew nothing about Fred after we left the Garden when it was already almost curfew, but even though he was probably immersed in his own things and I had a lot to study, I couldn't help but find myself thinking about him.I missed him. There was no point in hiding it. I missed him a lot.The only time I saw him during these days was when I was walking with Olivia to her room to keep studying for Herbology and he almost bumped into me while running in the corridor, with George following him shortly after, who waved and smiled as soon as he saw us.By the time my last exam arrived, I was quite happy with how I did it in the previous ones; my uncle already told me I had achieved the highest score in Potions and McGonagall gave me a dim smile after my exam, that meaning I must to have done it really good.Herbology and DADA were already done — Professor Sprout didn't give me any clue about my results and even though Umbridge hated me with all her heart, I managed to memorise all the theory word by word as it was on the book, so I must have achieved a good mark — and now, I only needed to do Charms and try to get the highest mark in both theoretical and practical exams as well.When my turn to the practical exam came, Professor Flitwick gave me a little smile;"Ms Arambella, you already know how this works. Please, stay calm."I nodded and he asked me to perform a series of five charms in front of the rest of the class. Luckily, I found them extremely easy and known so I was walking on solid ground.While the rest of my classmates had to do their exams, I let myself rest a little bit, leaning against one of the tables, and soon, my mind started to digress.Fred isn't here. He knew the exam is today but he is not here.I shook my head trying to spurn the thought. Whether I had feelings for him or not, I couldn't allow him to be the only thing rambling in my mind.Suddenly, a huge bang was heard outside of the room. I scowled, a bit puzzled. The only exam taking place at the same time as this one was Year 5's DADA exam and it was all theory, where does that noise come from?Another bang.Since our exam was almost finished, Flitwick allowed us — the ones who were already done — to go out and check everything was going fine. I almost jumped from the table because my curiosity was killing me.As soon as I opened the huge door, I saw the twins flying in their brooms, entering the classroom where the DADA exam was taking place. I walked to hide behind the classroom's door and observe what they were doing.Oh, fucking Merlin! I love them.They were throwing fireworks and paper exams in the air, messing with some of the Inquisitorial Squad and with Umbridge herself."What the fuck is this?" I drawled, still surprised but with a huge smile on my face, watching the colourful fireworks covering the room and the twins flying all over.I envy them so much."We are quitting Hogwarts, mate!" George flew by my side, grinning and looking more excited than ever."Yes, we got tired of it. Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes needs us!" Fred said coming into our encounter while throwing another firework inside the classroom.I chuckled. "Merlin's balls, I don't know what you two are on but it definitely worths it. Fucking shit, boys, you are my new idols."They giggled and went back inside as soon as Filch arrived trying to catch them. Being still in the air, George threw a huge firework that turned into a big orange dragon. Shit, it was scary but at the same time amusing and beautiful. The firework seemed to be alive and followed Umbridge out of the room, who was running and absolutely terrified. Since I was hiding behind the door, she didn't see me, but Fred sneaked into where I was, covering me with his body, letting me feel his touch over me for the first time in the last weeks.Before I could ask him what he was doing, the dragon divided into a group of other fireworks that attacked the hanging frames with the decrees, breaking their glass and burning the papers. Fred pulled the door a bit closer to make sure the glasses didn't fall upon us or hurt us."You two are absolutely mental!" I whispered, smiling, noticing a bit of adrenaline in my body."I know," he said back, with his voice a bit out-of-breath. "And you love it," he joked, winking at me.I do."Bet you're gonna miss me in here until summer arrives, aren't you, Lilith?"You can't even imagine how much, Freddie."Maybe." I smiled. "I won't have anyone to bother me.""Oh, darling, don't worry I'll keep bothering you at the Order's reunions, now that we are going to be members of it.""I'm not getting rid of you, am I?"He snickered, "Not anytime soon.""How lucky I am!" I pretended to ironize, still smiling, even though I did feel lucky for knowing in one way or another, I was going to still see him.He got back on his broom and before going back to fly next to his twin, he caught my face in one of his hands and pulled me closer to him."I'm gonna miss you so fucking much, Lilith," he left a little and brief kiss on my lips. "Think about me often, would you?"I winked at him, trying to still look confident and not as if I was going to melt right there in front of him, and he smiled again.Every single student came out of the classrooms to observe the incredible show the twins were doing with their fireworks, creating a stunning view of the cloudy sky full of bright colours and leaving their signature with a huge 'W' made by more fireworks.Weasley.Brilliant.✵ ✵ ✵I never imagined I would miss Fred Weasley this fucking much.More than an entire month had happened after he and his twin left Hogwarts — leaving a whole legend around them and making sure no one forgets them — and I could barely think of anything else that wasn't him. If the Lilith from the third or fifth year was told she would be at Hogwarts without Weasley, she would have probably jumped with joy and happiness, but me, this Lilith I have become, felt miserable not seeing him and his ginger hair, his whispers, his freckles, his smile and his pranks around. I genuinely fucking missed him. It reached a point where, after pretending in front of everybody I was doing okay and nothing happened, in the dark of my room I'd play Wonderwall non-stop and reread the note he left me for my birthday, memorising his handwriting and craving to be in front of him again.Since I had no motivation at all but still needed to play it cool, I spent most of the time hanging out with Hermione and Liv, who were the only ones who actually knew my feelings about Fred and wanted me to vent if I needed, with Lee, who happened to miss the twins too since they were his best friends, and with Draco, with who our friendship was going back to normal.Not wanting to show how actually devastated I felt for Fred's absence, I found that feeling consuming me and being pretty much one of my only thoughts, but I couldn't allow myself to feel so attached to someone and so dependent. I couldn't because he didn't even know about my feelings and because the more attached I get, the more possibilities appear for him to abandon me.I was reading my NEWT results at the Gardens as well as a letter from Remus that arrived earlier this morning, while my head rested on Hermione's lap as she was leaning against a tree's trunk, and Liv's head rested on mine."Girls, your marks are impeccable!"'Mione said, reading them with us. I gave a quick gaze at Liv's paper; she got all Outstandings, except an Exceeds the Expectations in Potions. I got an Outstanding in Potions, Charms and Transfigurations and an Exceeds the Expectations in Herbology and DADA, way more than what I was expecting."Yours will be even better, you pretty smart-arse," I tickled her, making her snicker."I don't think so. Actually, I think I might have failed almost all of my subjects," she spoke, really quick, playing with her nails and with a worried face, making Liv and I look at each other and smile."Hermione!" Liv grinned."You're literally the brightest witch of your age, girl," I added, letting her know how much we trusted on her."I don't know...But, anyway, what does Lupin's note say?"The smile on my face grew even more and I read them the note out loud;Dear, Lilith;

Congratulations, my dear! I'm the proudest Professor and friend on Earth! I've seen your NEWT results and I couldn't wait to write to you and tell you how extremely proud of you I feel and how amazing and intelligent I consider you. I knew you'd make it and now you're officially graduated from Hogwarts! Once again, congratulations. Tonks is bragging so much about how proud of you she is as well and Sirius sends you lots of hugs!

Love you lots lots lots and always proud of you.

P.S.: Now that you are of age and graduated, I can gladly welcome you as a member of the Order of the Phoenix. XXX.

- Remus.Hermione was about to say something but I saw Ron approaching us a bit nervous."Harry needs us," he simply said, a bit out-of-breath.My instinct alarmed me and I quickly got up, worried."Is he okay?!"Ron focused on me and swallowed hard. "Yeah, he needs us in the common room. Don't worry, he'll be fine.""You sure, Ron?"He nodded.Not completely sure about it, I went back to sitting down, observing them leave in the Gryffindor tower's direction.Liv and I stayed right there, talking about Pauline and Fred, and when the ginger's topic became too much for me, I changed the conversation and she silently agreed;"Have you already decided what you gonna do now that we have graduated?"She nodded pretty excited; "Yeah, I think I might study muggle psychology. Maybe I can work at St Mungo's, heard they are lacking mental health professionals."I opened my eyes widely, and genuinely surprised; "You know what? It suits you a lot, it's actually a great idea.""Dad supports me a lot about it and he has already found a good flat where we can live at Diagon Alley."That had been our plan for four years; moving together, starting a new life, working in something we genuinely like..."Really? Where he got it from?""It used to belong to one of the people who work for the Quibbler, but they don't need it anymore so they were selling it and dad purchased it for me and you.""Oh, Merlin, Liv, how much money did he spend?" I asked, worried because it didn't sit well with me to have Xenophillus paying for my home.Liv burst into laughter. "Money? You sound as if you didn't know my dad! It was a Quibbler worker who sold it to him, he only had to give him a couple of stuff from his shelves and the man was satisfied."I sighed relieved. I should have known.It was already almost curfew when we saw in the distance Harry, Luna, Ginny, Hermione, Ron and Nev walking down the corridor, really fast. I touched Liv's shoulder to let her know we should follow them."Oi, you lot!" I called them, making Ginny, Hermione and Neville turn around but keep walking."Lilith, something really bad happened," Nev whispered."What?""Voldemort has Sirius," Ginny said, pretty worried.The only mention of his name made me flinch and feel my blood abandoning my face."Hang on, what?! How do you know? And how did he get him?!" I asked with a trembly voice, following them in the bridge's direction."I saw it in a dream, and then tried to communicate with him through the chimney. Umbridge caught us but we already got rid of her. I'm going to rescue my godfather now." Harry announced, sounding pretty sure of himself."We will have to go flying, don't we?" Luna intervened."Not you." Liv quickly added. "I'm not letting you risk yourself, I'll go.""Livie!" her sister protested."If Liv goes, I'm going.""First of all, forget the 'we'," Harry said, turning to face Luna. "you are not going anywhere, second of all, Lilith you aren't going anywhere either and third of all, Ron is the only one who has a broom at the moment."I scowled and crossed my arms in front of my chest."I'm not going? Who are you to tell me I'm not going?""Lilith..." Hermione whispered.Harry sighed. "Look, if Voldemort is in there, he wants you almost as much as he wants me and probably he won't be there alone. Who do you think is going to be in there? The Death Eaters who escaped, right? And who is one of them?"I realised and my expression fell.Harry nodded, watching how I was getting the point. "Aha, you're joining the dots. I'm not letting you confront the bitch of your mother now.""Harry, I'm older than you and it has to happen. Sooner or later, it has to happen.""Better later than sooner," he said walking again while Ginny and Ron were also arguing. Harry tried to stand with Ron but Ginny quickly cut him off."Harry, the more people you have there, the easier it would be to rescue Sirius!" I tried to make him understand but the boy shook his head."No, you and Olivia can be very useful to us here. Olivia can keep the Inquisitorial Squad under control and you can go to your uncle and make sure he did understand my message saying Padfoot is in danger. If he didn't, I need you to call the Order.""Luna stays," Liv stated pretty seriously."Livie, I can fight, let me do it.""But if you get — hurt...." my friend stuttered, knowing the word that appeared in her mind was way harder than 'hurt' and even harder to mention."She won't." Nev interrupted in a burst of confidence. "I'll protect her."I smiled at him, feeling extremely proud of the Gryffindor boy.Liv let out a long sigh. "You better protect my little sister with your life, Longbottom, if not, I'm hunting you and you'll meet the Lovegood's rage, clear?"Nev swallowed hard but managed to nod."And try not to get killed in the process. I want all of you coming back here safe and sound or I'm being the one killing you, a' right?""Livie, that doesn't make sen-""A'right?!" she asked again, interrupting and lifting her voice, threatening them with her wand."A'right," they nodded.While they kept deciding in which way they would fly, Luna pointed out how a couple of thestrals had arrived. I knew about those creatures even though I couldn't see them since I never saw anyone die in front of me.After another discussion and more thestrals appearing, they finally left under our nervous and anxious eyes.They were going to confront him. They were going to see him.I silently begged the universe for my mother not to be in there because if she was... Well, let's say it would be an almost completely lost fight for my friends."Ok, maybe we should divide." I started, watching how Liv nodded. "Can you go to make sure Draco and his lot don't get out of the office while I look for my uncle?"We part our ways and I literally ran to Severus's office, feeling my heart hitting hard in my chest and the adrenaline filling me while the air abandoned my lungs."Severus!" I shouted at him getting inside of his place, with my voice out-of-breath. "Sirius...You-know-who...""I know, Lilith," he said looking at his chimney. "It has to be done.""What?""Potter needs to see the Dark Lord. He needs to know about the prophecy.""The prophecy?" I asked confused. "Severus, Black is in danger, we need to tell the Order!""No, Potter needs to know he is the Chosen One. That the Dark Lord chose him! Lilith, you have to know, your mother knew it!"And suddenly the memory hit me; the rumours in Azkaban about the reason why He-who-must-not-be-named fell.He chose. And he failed."He failed," I repeated."He didn't fail. Potter is the one.""Then more point in favour to warn the Order! We are sending Harry to the lion's den!""Let's only pray your mother isn't there. If she kills them, the hype and the adrenaline won't stop her and she would literally destroy everything following the Dark Lord.""Oh, for Merlin's sake!" I pushed him slightly taking a piece of paper and writing in it, throwing it into the chimney with a bit of floo powder. "12 Grimmauld Place."A single minute went by and another note appeared in the fire. I took it carefully and Severus tried to take it from my hands to read it first but I moved to avoid it.The Order is on its way. Please Lilith, for me, for you and for everything you love the most, don't move from Hogwarts. Severus will let you know once you can come.

- Remus"Fuck!" I complained, letting Snape read the note."You've heard him," he said, with a bit of despise. "It's unbelievable that he is the one convincing you, but you have heard him.""Severus, if my mother sees any of the Order, she is going to kill them. I have to go!""You aren't going anywhere! They are grown and trained adults. I'm not letting you go anywhere!""Why not?!""BECAUSE YOU ARE MY NIECE!" he shouted, taking a long breath. "I'm not having you killed and carrying with the guilt. I'm not letting your mother taking you and ruining your life more than she has already done. You might think I don't appreciate you, Lilith, and you have the right to think so. I might not have been the best relative in the world but that's completely different from serving you on a silver platter to her."I crossed my arms, feeling nervous about what could be going on at the moment."Listen carefully, Lilith. Things are probably going to become even tougher from now on, I will not be able to communicate with you as frequently as now once you are out of here. For your own benefit, I'll let you every possible facility at your reach but it would be better if you do not contact me unless I do it with you."We stayed in there in complete silence while I kept wandering all over the room. After ten minutes, Liv knocked on the door and Snape let her in. A bit shy for being in my uncle's presence, she quickly got by my side and caught my hands in between hers."Is Draco okay?" I asked in a soft whisper."Yes, McGonagall is taking on him."I nodded and she kept caressing my hand to relax and calm me, I also did the same to her because she was probably more worried than me since her own sister was in there."I should have gone with her," she whispered."She will be okay, Liv. Luna knows how to defend herself.""I know, and I know Neville will protect her but...if anything happens to my little sister..."Another note appeared on the fire and Severus took it faster than any of us. He raised his look and gave us an unexpressive face."Get in the chimney, you two," he simply said. I quickly dragged Liv with me. "The Burrow."My eyes opened widely. THE— WHAT?! The Burrow?! Why not Grimmauld?!I closed my eyes feeling the floo powder on us and the magic on our bodies. When I opened them, I noticed I was getting out of another chimney and saw Mrs Weasley helping Liv and me to get out of it. I noticed the ginger woman had tears on her face and looked pretty pale.Liv ran as soon as she saw Luna sitting on the couch. She was covered in dust and a bit hurt, but alive and safe. I saw everyone's long faces and Remus opened his path to me. Before I could say anything his eyes watered and he ran to me to fusion in a big and tight hug."Oh, Lilith," he whispered in my shoulder."Remus... what happened?""He is gone," he cried on my shoulder. I never thought I would be having Remus Lupin crying on my shoulder. I notice Harry had his face against one of the cushions, with spasms that indicated to me he was crying too. "He is gone."I knew he wasn't talking about Voldemort.

Sirius.

Sirius Orion Black died at 36 years old. A whole life to live in front of him after carrying with a sentence he didn't deserve. Spending more than half of his life without freedom; first, because of his family's believes and then, because of a crime he didn't commit.It was fucking unfair.I only separated from Remus to hug Harry and tell him how deeply sorry I was. The poor boy let himself cry on my shoulder and I felt terrible for him because in his short life he had already dealt with too many tragedies. Mr Wealsey informed him that Dumbledore wanted to see him at Hogwarts before letting him go back to his muggle aunt's home early tomorrow in the morning."Your mother wasn't in there," Harry said, wiping out his tears uselessly since he kept crying. "But Bellatrix asked us about you, she wanted to know where you were. Obviously, we didn't answer, but I heard how she told Lucius Malfoy that Circe wouldn't like that."I swallowed hard and felt the goosebumps and chills covering me. Fuck her. I spurned every thought about my mother because she was far away from being my priority at the moment."Kid, why don't you take Remus to the table? He hasn't drunk anything since he arrived...I'm worried about him. Maybe you can convince him." Mrs Weasley spoke to me with the softest tone she could and with the track of the previous tears on her face.I nodded and helped Remus to get up from the couch and sit down at the kitchen's table. He was no longer crying, but the look on his face was devastating. His hair was messy, his eyes were kinda swollen, every once in a while he sniffed and his skin was way paler, making his scars more visible. I felt terrible, absolutely terrible for him."Remus... please, have a little sip of water at least." I encouraged him in a whisper."I can't—" he le out a long sigh and passed his hands all over his face. "I simply can't.""I can't even imagine how much you are hurting right now and I really wish things were different."His voice broke a little bit and another tear came out of his eyes. "He is gone. Padfoot... My Padfoot is gone. He was killed by his own cousin. Bellatrix didn't even hesitate.""Oh, Merlin," I passed my arm around his shoulders and even though he was way taller than me I made him rest his head on my shoulder, showing him my support.I was well aware Fred was in the room too, I could feel his eyes on me every once in a while and I would be lying if I say I didn't look at him once since I set a foot on the Burrow, but right now, nothing and nobody else mattered to me more than Remus."I have been losing every single person I cared about. Every single one. Marlene, Peter when he joined that bastard, James, Lily...and now, him. I only have you, Tonks and Harry left." The man whispered, trying not to stutter."You will always have me, Remus. No matter what, you will always have me.""I know," he said, grabbing my hand between his. "I'm not letting your mother put a single finger of hers on you. I don't care if I have to end with her myself. She's not hurting you, and I know more than one in this room agrees with me in this."Kingsley appeared at the door and let out a long sigh, showing how tired he was."How's Dora?" Remus asked, standing up at full speed."She will stay at St. Mungo's until tomorrow.""Hang on, Tonks was hurt?!" I panicked, standing up as well. "I need to see her.""NO!" Remus, Fred, George, Liv and Hermione spoke at the same time."It's still not safe out there, kid." Kingsley tried to reason with me. I sat down again, disappointed. "She will be okay, you'll see. We can't risk any of us right now, especially after what Harry told you. They want you.""Snape asked us to keep you under protection." Mrs Weasley added.Remus grabbed my hand again, looking a bit calmer;"You will stay here in the Burrow until the day after tomorrow. Then you'll be coming with me to my apartment until you can move with Liv to yours. It's not much but—"My heart melted right there, and I caressed his hand; "It's more than enough, Remus. I don't even know how to thank you for everything you do for me.""You don't have to, dear," he let a very and dim smile that didn't reach his eyes."Thank you too, Mrs and Mr Weasley, for letting me stay at your house."They both nodded and continued cuddling Harry and their children while I stayed there with Remus. After ten minutes, Kingsley asked Harry and the rest of the kids to follow him back to Hogwarts since Dumbledore wanted to speak with them, especially with Harry. Since my uncle specified I could not return, I stayed there watching how they, one by one, entered the chimney and disappeared."Liv, you are leaving too?"She grabbed Luna's hand. "Yes, I need to heal Luna's wounds and stay with her, you don't mind, right?""Of course not! Please go, and make sure she's alright."My best friend nodded and accompanied her little sister to the chimney where shortly after they disappeared as well.Now we were only Remus, the twins, their parents and me."Lucius Malfoy was imprisoned, Lilith. He has been sent to Azkaban. You should try to keep an eye on Draco as much as you can if you don't want him to become a Death Eater too." Remus murmured while moving the teaspoon in his tea."Oh, my Draco... I hope now that he will be with Narcissa, he'll be a bit safer, but if Bellatrix is out... Fuck, why is all this so complicated?""Tomorrow your uncle will send all your belongings, including Iris.""I can send Draco an encrypted letter that only he can decode to try to keep the contact with him," I completed his thoughts and Remus nodded.I wasn't planning to abandon Draco anytime soon or leave him at his fucking crazy bitch aunt's mercy. I knew for a fact that Narcissa wasn't as involved in the pureblood supremacy as her husband, but was it enough to risk her own son?The night arrived and while everyone was waiting for Merlin knows what news, Remus and I stayed at the table and I managed to make him drink his tea. A huge bang was heard upstairs, scaring us."Oh, God, what are you two doing?!" Mrs Weasley called out the twins who lifted their hands in the air, looking as surprised as her."Nothing, it's not us." They said at the same time."It must be the Boggart, dear." Mr Weasley tried to calm his wife."Don't worry, Molly. I'm getting rid of it." Remus stood up but I quickly caught his wrist making him sit down again."You are doing nothing. I am getting rid of the Boggart. You aren't mentally ready to be facing that shit right now, for fuck's sake, Remus. Stay here and rest. I'll take over it."As I stood up I heard him let out a little snort, "Seems like I'm not the adult in here anymore."I gave him a little and warm smile. "Seems like I'm taking care of you for once, more like." I turned around to find the ginger woman still looking at her sons. "Mrs Weasley, would you mind indicate me the way, please?""I will do it." George interrupted, standing from leaning against the chimney with his twin, who kept with his arms crossed looking at the floor. "Follow me."He started going upstairs and I followed him, giving little gazes at the place. I remembered how Draco called it a pigsty but it was actually a super warm and cosy place, full of familiar and soft tones and vibes. It also smelled delicious and it was incredibly clean and decorated with great taste. The Arambella House was bigger but also colder, darker, in ruins and lonely. The Burrow was exactly how a family home should look and feel. We finally got in front of a black door and George turned around with his usual kind look."Here we are," he sighed. "I'm really happy to see that you're safe, Lilith. We got deadly scared thinking you could have gone with Harry to the Department of Mysteries." He made a long pause. "Wanna know something? He kept wandering non-stop all over the room trying not to look too worried or interested in the rest's eyes. But he couldn't trick me, obvs, a twin knows his twin."I let out a single chuckle. "I didn't go because Harry didn't let me.""Oh, and he was right to do so. Fred would kill me if he finds out I tell you this and he might not have worded it, but he has missed you since the last time we saw you at Hogwarts, and when he saw your note at Grimmauld during the Order's reunion, he asked Remus to make sure he didn't let you move from the castle...Even though Lupin wasn't planning to let you go, anyway."I felt a burst of fire growing inside of my body at George's words. Fred missed me. Fred was worried something could have happened to me."Well, I'll have to face my mother one day. Sooner or later.""Better later than sooner," George repeated Harry's words. The ginger's smile grew a little bit and he messed my hair. "You'll be okay in there?""Yeah, can't be that tough, can it?" I stated, pretty confident."I s'pose. You are a good witch so maybe not to you," he opened the door, and let me get inside the room, where there was barely any furniture other than a locked wardrobe with loud noises inside of it."You can close the door, George." I turned around to look at the ginger, making sure I was getting the right position. He nodded and let me in there, ready to get rid of the annoying Boggart.The moonlight barely entered through the window, making the place darker than the rest of the house. I looked at the wardrobe and cast an Alohomora to open it, ready to face the creature looking like my mother. The door opened with a squeal and something moved in the dark. I raised my wand with my heart beating against my chest, trying to look confident enough.My mother got out of the wardrobe slowly, with her facial bones showing more than ever because of how thin and pale she was, her dirty hair framing her face and the torn dress covered in dust and grime glued to her body. I gasped at her only presence and the pressure of her black piercing and powerful eyes on me. But she wasn't alone. And I had to take my hand to my mouth not to shout once I saw who she was dragging."Fred..." I whispered, watching how my mother put him on his knees in front of her, showing me his gaunt face, with blood and dust in it. He had his eyes watered and his lips dried while he was looking at me, with fear in his eyes as my mother's wand was against his throat."Lili... my baby..." she drawled with her cold voice, tingling my spine and making me shiver."This is not real. You aren't Circe and Fred is downstairs, safe and far from you." I stated, making sure I wasn't stuttering."Oh, but who told you this is not going to happen, Lili? I'm going to get you, sooner or later. And before I drag you with me, I'm destroying everything you ever loved," she kept her sharp but calm tone while pointing at Fred, whose breath was more erratic because of how nervous he was. "I told you once, baby, you are mine...or you are no one's.""You are not going to hurt him." I tried to say firmly but my voice was already trembling. "I'll make sure of it. I'll rather me being the one killing you before letting you even breathe near him, do you understand me?...mother." I spat the last word at her.She lowered her face and smirked, looking even more dangerous and deadly. "Stubborn. Just like your father," she claimed, pretty calm. "I'm disappointed in you, Lili. You fell in love with a blood traitor, I thought I had raised you not to commit my same mistakes.""You didn't raise me, you bitch.""You are right, I didn't. But I'm still in your system, dear. Otherwise, I wouldn't be your Boggart," she smiled, pulling Fred's hair hardly, gaining a complaining sound from him."Leave him alone." I started to feel my eyes watering and my voice even shakier. "This is between you and me.""But it isn't, Lili. It never was. This should have been you and me against them, but you ruined it as your father ruined our perfect life. I thought I could erase the Arambella blood in you but it was already too late. You are polluted, just like all of them." she continued, separating a little bit from Fred, who was still kneeling on the floor, with his hands tied and a little line of blood running down his forehead to his chin. Circe pointed her wand at him and I pointed mine at her."I have had enough of you." I spat, wiping out a single tear that escaped from my eyes. "Riddikulus."It didn't work. Instead, she giggled and her smile grew."Riddikulus!" I repeated, but she had already adopted the perfect position."Darling..." Fred looked at me, with a tear escaping from his eyes and I started to panic. No, please, make it stop. Make it stop."Avada Kedavra!" she hissed and Fred's body fell to the ground. I burst into tears and fell on my knees next to his body."No... please, no..." I sobbed, touching his cold face.The room's door opened suddenly and widely, letting me see Mrs Weasley through my tears. She looked at me with pity in her eyes and when she saw the dead body of her son in front of me I could see her eyes watering a bit and she getting paler. But, as the strong woman she was, instead of breaking down like me, she looked fiercely and firmly at my Boggart and before it could change into hers, she pointed it with her wand;"RIDDIKULUS!" the strength of Mrs Weasley spell was such, that the Boggart flew out of the window. The ginger woman ran to it and closed it, making sure it couldn't get inside again. There wasn't anything in front of me anymore, but the shock of releasing that what I feared the most in the world was my mother hurting Fred, made me feel glued to the floor and almost out of breath.Mrs Weasley turned around to give me a short look and she kneeled in front of me. I thought she would say something about my mother or blame me or Merlin knows what, but instead, she caressed my hair and talked to me with the most emotional and soft tone she ever used with me;"Oh, my dear, why didn't you tell me?"I sniffled and wiped my tears while she helped me to stand up."I should have known, I should have- Oh, Merlin, I can't believe I treated you like that this whole time while you- God..." she seemed not to know which words to use. She grabbed my hand and left a good caress in it, transmitting me her corporal warmth and reminding me of her son's touch. "Come down, dear, I'll prepare you a good hot chocolate. Heard you like them, don't you?"I nodded and gave her a little smile while she guided me slowly out of the room and downstairs, without more words needed. Once we got into the living room and the kitchen again, everyone put their eyes on me."Lilith, are you okay? Why did it take you so long?" Remus asked, standing from his chair while Mrs Weasley ran to the kitchen to start preparing the chocolate, even though she was incredibly tired."I'm okay, Remus," I nodded at him. "Mrs Weasley, there's no need to prepare all that, you're too tired.""No, no, dear, let me do it. Oh, Remus, the poor kid wasn't aware of how exhausted she is as well and thought she could deal with the Boggart by herself..."I felt my heart hitting hard against my chest, scared she would say what my Boggart was, and trying to think how I would explain it to Fred, who was behind me with his twin, in case she revealed it. But she didn't, and I let out a sigh of relief."You sure you are okay, dear?" Remus asked genuinely worried and I sat in front of him."I promise you I am.""Mum, let me do it, I can prepare her the chocolate." Fred suddenly interrupted, letting me hear his real voice for the first time in a whole month. I couldn't help but look at him as soon as he talked, while he walked the way from the chimney next to his twin to the kitchen, next to his mother."No, Fred, you will mess it up!""I won't," he said, sounding a bit irritated, "Lilith is right, you are too tired. Besides, I know how she likes her chocolate."I opened my eyes widely and stared at his back while he kept removing the chocolate powder on the pot. Did he?! Did he actually paid attention to such a regular detail like how I like hot chocolate?I bit my lip discreetly, staring at his back wanting to jump out of my chair and hug him tightly.Mrs Weasley sighed, giving up as she saw her son was actually doing a good job and she walked, patting my shoulder on her way, towards her husband to sit on the couch by his side.My eyes followed her unconsciously and found George looking at us with pure shock on his face. 'What the fuck? ' he mouthed silently, with a smile on his face but the surprise in his eyes. I shrugged returning him the smile. Remus also had his eyebrows raised, surprised, staring right there where Mrs Weasley's hand touched me, but being more discreet than the twin.I heard how Fred took out of one of the counters two mugs that seemed handmade and served some of the chocolate in them. Quickly he slithered into the seat next to me, with a little smile and those shiny brown eyes I missed so much during this time, letting me appreciate him silently while he put one of the mugs in front of me.His corporal heat next to me was already warming me and the smell of powder and shampoo coming from him instantly calmed me. I smiled back at him."Thank you so much.""Nothing to thank for," he said, making his smile bigger. "Give it a try."I grabbed the mug and breathed the hot steam coming from the drink. I took a little sip and savoured it in my mouth. It was perfect; as sweet, hot and thick as I liked it."It's perfect, thanks."He nodded and gave a sip to his, and while his eyes stayed on mine, I noticed how he grabbed one of my hands between his under the table and gave it a little and very dim caress, so soft and slow it was almost unnoticeable. Almost.Oh, Freddie. You are only making me fall more for you...

After a couple of minutes, Mrs Weasley interrupted the silence;"Boys, are you staying the night?""Yeah, tomorrow we will spend the first night at the flat. There're some things that aren't ready yet but we wanna be there before opening the shop," George spoke, while Fred stood up from next to me to walk next to his twin.The ginger woman nodded, looking not completely pleased with the answer she got. Everyone knew Molly Weasley didn't exactly support the twins' decision of owning a joke shop. Even though I personally thought it was a great idea.A whole hour later, the twins announced they needed to sleep and their parents followed them shortly after, asking if Remus and I were okay and offering us the empty rooms in the house. I declined kindly since even though I was extremely tired, Remus wasn't planning to sleep anytime soon and I wasn't going to let him by his own."Lilith, why don't you go to sleep, my dear?" he insisted, but I quickly shook my head. Remus let out a long and heavy sigh. "Fine, then, mind coming with me out? I need a bit of fresh air."We opened the door silently, making sure all the lights were off so we didn't bother anyone, and sat on the porch, close to each other to keep the little heat around us. The dim moonlight covered us under a starry night, Remus couldn't help but stare at it with despise and tears in his eyes. I let my head rest on his shoulder and he patted my knee."Thank you for all the support you are showing me," he sincerely spoke, giving me a little smile I corresponded."There's nothing to thank me for, Remus. You would've done the same for me."A very short silence installed between us. It wasn't uncomfortable at all, but it felt heavy since it was early in the night. Probably just a few hours left from sunrise."Lilith, can I ask you a question?""Go on.""Did you see Circe up there as your Boggart?" Remus asked, watching carefully my reaction."I did. It was terrible." The memory of my mother holding her wand against Fred's neck made me feel sick and full of sorrow. The fear in his brown eyes and how he murmured the word 'darling' was deeply trapped under my skin and all I wanted was to run inside, go upstairs and kiss the ginger boy with all the love I felt for him."But you didn't only see that, did you?"My heart raced and I raised my head from the man's shoulder. "How do you know?""Molly's reaction. She's known for a while Circe's your Boggart but never until now treated you properly. You had to see something that actually shocked her. Otherwise..."The thought about confessing Remus my feelings for Fred rambled in my mind. It was admitting it out loud to someone who wasn't Liv nor Hermione, the ones who saw the revelation moment, but also it was Remus, one of the only few people I would have trusted with my own life. The person who always stood up for me and protected me every time he could and one of the first people to find out about my encounters with the ginger."I didn't." I finally let out. "I saw Circe killing Fred Weasley. Mrs Weasley saw it, that's why she was being so considerate with me."Remus's eyes opened widely but he managed to recover from the surprise and to pass his arm around my shoulder. I wasn't going to cry, I already did it upstairs in front of the false corpse and Molly had to see me in such a low moment, I couldn't allow myself to breakdown for a Boggart in front of Remus who just a few hours ago actually lost someone as important for him like Sirius was."Oh, Lilith...""I think I'm in love with him, Remus," I whispered, calmly. "No, I know I love him." I sniffed a bit because of the cold air. "My Patronus has changed, it isn't a German Sheppard anymore, it is a magpie. Just like his.""Dear, that's... the purest show of love someone could ever have by far. I'd lie if I say this caught me completely by surprise because it didn't. Unbelievable how it seems, I've started to know you too well and you look at him in such a familiar way that I know it's unmistakable."I sighed hard, playing with my nails. "I haven't confessed it to him, though.""Well, I can't tell you anything about him because even though the twins seem to behave like an open book, they truly don't. But, from my experience, hiding your feelings for someone who you're close to only works to waste time.""I don't know. I don't think I'm ready yet. It scares me to- "I breathed deeply. " To think that he might not feel the same for me. And, what do I expect if he actually does — which I really doubt —? To start a relationship in the middle of a magic war knowing that I might confront my mother and not live to tell the tale? Or to live constantly with the fear of him abandoning me? Nah, I'm not ready. Besides, if I do survive the war, I want to focus on therapy. I can't keep living with this fucking trauma.""And that's completely valid, dear. It doesn't matter what I can advise you or not, your feelings are only and completely yours to deal with them and to choose with who you share them."I rested my head again on Remus's shoulder and interlaced my arm with his. Opening myself to the only adult figure I felt truly safe and comfortable with, was like having a little taste of what I would have felt if I had had a caring father who actually stayed with me, and I knew I'll never be thankful enough for having Remus Lupin in my life.We stayed there for the rest of the night, watching the sunrise, chatting in a low voice and supporting each other. I can't exactly remember when we fell asleep in that exact position but, by the time I felt someone's hand on my shoulder waking me up, the sun was up in the almost clear sky. Summer had clearly arrived in South England."Morning, beautiful." Fred crooned funnily ironic as he was sitting on his heels, looking at me with his shiny brown eyes, a mischievous smile and the sun brightening back in his ginger hair, being a little bit messed up by the morning wind.I raised my head from Remus's shoulder, who was still asleep against the woody handrail of the porch."Morning..." I replied with a sleepy and hoarse voice, rubbing my eyes to wake me up properly. "What time is it?""Nine in the morning, more or less," his smile grew on his face. "I know the Burrow isn't pretty big but, you do know we have beds inside, right? You don't need to sleep on the stairs."I snorted, putting a hand in front of my face to avoid the sunlight hitting me straight in it. "Oh, shut up, the Burrow is perfect. Remus wanted to get a bit of fresh air and we ended up falling asleep.""Well, then you should get your pretty face inside before the Order arrives with Ron and Ginny and think we have kicked you two out of the house. Also, Remus gotta go to King's Cross to look after Harry.""Did something else happen to him?" I asked a bit worried."Nah, I heard something about his muggle family and the Order wanting to make sure they treat him properly. I've seen them before and if all muggles are like the Dursleys, then I want them all far away from me. Weird as fuck that people."I snickered a little bit. "Yeah, I bet you aren't used to the muggle world, are you, Freddie?"His eyebrows raised playfully. "Are you, Lilith?""Bet.""Oh, right, I forgot you do fancy the muggle world, don't you?" he chuckled, giving up. "Wake up Remus before he misses Harry, and get inside, mum's making coffee."He entered the house leaving the door opened and I carefully woke up Remus. He opened his eyes suddenly, a bit scared and held to the handrail."What the fuck-" he mumbled, a bit shocked. "Oh, Lilith, cheers. What am I doing here?""We fell asleep at some point during dusk.""Oh, bollocks, that's why my back hurts so much. I'm too old for this shit." Just-woke-up Remus turned out to be funnier than what I expected. He stood up slowly, with complaining noises as he touched his back. "Fuck! I forgot I've gotta got to see Harry at King's Cross."I stood up with a little smile on my face as I observed Remus panicking a little bit."Remus, for God's sake!" Molly Weasley appeared at the door with her hands on her hips. Lupin quickly brushed his messy hair. "Kingsley is waiting for you at the station!- Hang on, did you two sleep in here the whole night?!""Yes, but don't worry, Mrs Weasley, we're fine.""Lilith, I need to go now, but I'll be picking you up for taking you to my apartment tomorrow in the morning, ok? Need to prepare some things before you arrive in there.""If the Weasleys don't mind, then, it's completely fine.""Of course I don't mind, dear. You can stay here as much as you want," the ginger woman spoke with a soft voice.Remus looked at me with a smile on his face, still surprised at Molly's new behaviour."Thank you so much, Mrs Weasley. But, Remus, you don't need to bother yourself so much, I will only be staying for a week until Liv and I can move to the new flat.""It doesn't matter how much time, you'll be my guest and I want you to be as comfortable as possible."I hugged him tightly and finally let him go through the Weasleys' chimney with Floo Powder."Come here, dear. You fancy some coffee?" Mrs Weasley smiled at me before her twins' and husband's surprised looks. I nodded a bit shy and George quickly patted the seat next to him, which apparently, was usually Ginny's. "Your uncle has made your trunk arrive. It has a Capacious Extremis spell."The woman put a mug with hot and steamy coffee in front of me, a cristal bottle of milk and sugar."Thank you, Mrs Weasley," I smiled at her while putting three teaspoons of sugar on the black coffee and giving the first sip. Perfect."You drink your coffee like that?" George asked, genuinely surprised."I do." I grinned at him. "And my tea with no sugar and just a little sip of milk.""That's exactly how you're supposed to drink it. Cheers, Lilith." Mr Weasley said with a sweet tone and I smiled at him, a bit surprised and confused since this was probably the first time Arthur Weasley ever spoke to me."Forgive my husband, dear. He's extremely British," Molly sat next to him, with a mug for herself and grinning mischievously, reminding me to her sons, at Arthur."Oh, wait, you are Irish, right, Mrs Weasley?"She nodded. "And proud. I even tried to teach my kids how to speak Gaeilge but it was useless, only Ginny and Bill know how to do it properly.""We understand it, though," George added, taking a bite from his toast."Yeah, Georgie and I are so used to having you telling us off in it that we're basically fluent by now.""Oh, don't be so dramatic! You two know I have to be really angry to be telling you off in Gaeilge. What is Lilith going to think of me?!"I couldn't help but snicker when I saw the twins opening their eyes widely at the same time as they looked at their mother, confused."Mum... are you feeling good?" Fred asked."Yes, dear, why?"The boys looked at each other and shrugged."Lilith, would you like us showing you the house once we finish breakfast?" George suggested, while his twin had his eyes on me and a little smile on his face."Sure, but I'll help your mother first.""Oh, no! You are a guest in here, there's no need for you to help me."Before I could refuse to, Fred and George stood up at the same time and grabbed each of my hands to drag me with them. They showed me every place in the house and it turned out to be as beautiful and cosy as I perceived it the first time. Even though it was a bit small for the seven of them, it felt so homely and warm that the last time I felt so comfortable in someone's house was at the Lovegood's.The tour ended in the twins' room which happened to be a bit bigger than the other ones since they had to share it. Already from outside of it and with the door closed, the smell of powder and fresh shampoo could be noticed. They opened the door and let me get inside first to examine it and to admire it while they stayed leaning at the door's frame. The views from the window were stunning and the number of prank items and Quidditch posters they owned really surprised me."It's really cool, boys.""Bah, it's not that much.""It's perfect. I really like it." I slightly scowled. I didn't like them discrediting the beautiful place they actually had. I touched a telescope in front of me, over their desk, but quickly took my hand off it when George hissed."I wouldn't touch that if I were you, Lilith. It'd punch you."I couldn't help but giggle. Of fucking course, it had to be a prank of them. "How am I even surprised?""As if you didn't know us by now, darling." Fred winked at me."GEORGE! COME 'ERE A MINUTE!" Mrs Weasley's voice sounded all over the house, scaring the living fuck out of me. George rolled his eyes;"Going, mum!" he replied while going downstairs, leaving Fred and me alone. Alone for the first time in more than a month.He smirked mischievously and entered fully the room, slowly, closing the door behind him. Fred sat on his bed, stretching and spreading his long legs, still staring at me."You know? It's a bit weird to have you in here." Fred started, drawling, and with a soft tone. "But I think I kinda like it.""Well, it won't last too much, you already know I'm leaving with Remus tomorrow morning."He nodded slowly. "Yeah, what a pity, though. We have a lot to catch up with, don't we, darling?" he murmured, making his smile wider and sending quivers and butterflies all over my body. I let out a long sigh as a smile appeared on my face. "Haven't seen you in a whole month.""Bet you have missed me, haven't you?" I pretended to sound uninterested but playful at the same time, even though in my mind I was craving for him to admit it out loud."Uhh, you can't even imagine, Lilith. Have you missed me?" Fred replied."Maybe-" My eyes rambled all over his room and focused on a specific object. "Hang on, is that what I think it is?!"His eyes followed mine, a bit confused, but then chuckled when he noticed what I was looking at. "If you are thinking that's an electric guitar, then you're right.""Oh, Merlin! Where did you get it?!" I took one of my hands to my mouth. "Can I see it?""'Course."I quickly kneeled on the floor and got the guitar between my hands. It was of a beautiful and polished black, looking really well treated. I was afraid to even breathe close to it and I couldn't help but touch carefully the strings."Where you got it from?""Remus gave it to George and me when we went to visit him at his place. Said it used to belong to a friend of his when they were younger. I've been learning to play it since then," Fred smiled.Fred Weasley playing the guitar.... that was a view I was keeping for the night."Fuck! It's bloody beautiful.""You can try to play it. I enchanted it so nobody can hear it from the first floor.""Really?""Yeah, go on!I got the correct position and try to remember any melody I could play, I sat properly on the floor, with my legs crossed, and started to play the start of Nothing Else Matters by Metallica. It was one of the easiest ones for me to remember and to play so it came out quite natural. I could feel Fred's eyes on me as I kept playing, fully concentrated on catching the exact notes and making the guitar sound as good as it deserved.Since it was a bit difficult to play without a spike, I ended the song when a second guitar should have joined. As I raised my eyes back to Fred's, I found him looking at me with a fierce bright on them and his mouth slightly open."Wicked..." he murmured. "You surprise me more every single day, Arambella... Fuck, that was so bloody attractive!"I giggled putting the guitar back in its place and standing up."You'll have to play for me," I said while approaching Fred slowly.Before I could notice and still with that dim smirk on his face, he grabbed my wrist and dragged me closer to him to make me sit on his lap, quickly surrounding my hips with his hands."One day..." he whispered in a seductive tone, tempting me. His hands squeezed my hip a bit more, glueing me more to his body. "I've fucking missed you so much, darling."The butterflies in my stomach were happier than ever.

I stood up from Fred's lap as soon as George entered the room with an accomplice smirk on his face. The three of us stayed in the twins' dorm for the rest of the day chatting and listening to some of the music the boys had. By the dusk, I was already exhausted and Mrs Weasley offered me one of her other sons' empty rooms, I ended up in a mostly empty one with higher views and a red wall full of quidditch and different magical creatures posters. Especially, it was full of pictures of dragons. I was in Charlie Weasley's bedroom.Without daring to investigate a little bit more in the room, I let myself fall on the soft, clean bed and fell immediately asleep under the light coming from the full moon.By the time I woke up the next day morning, Remus had already arrived - quite drawn and with a new little scar on his face - and was waiting for me in the kitchen with Mrs Weasley telling him off for not eating enough.The twins got downstairs as well, freshly showered and dressed, with backpacks on their backs, ready to leave too."Oh, you're leaving? I'm going to be alone?" Mrs Weasley made a slight pout, staring at her sons.The two boys rolled their eyes at the same time; "We've told you we would spend our first night at our flat today, and you won't be alone, mum, Ron and Ginny are arriving soon.""Oh, yes, my last babies left..." she murmured caressing the twins' cheeks and hugging them."Ready to appear, dear?" Remus caught my attention, interlacing his arm with mine."Sure. Mrs Weasley-" I called her. "Thank you so much again."She smiled widely at me. "Nothing to thank for, dear. You're welcome here whenever you want."Soon after, Remus grabbed his wand and silently made us disappear from the Burrow. I closed my eyes because I genuinely hated the revolting in my stomach the spell left, and when I finally felt solid ground under my feet, I opened my eyes."Where are we?""Chapman Street, one of the less crowded neighbourhoods in London. My flat is in this building. I have antiapparition spells inside of it and I suggest you do the same once Liv and you get yours."Remus's place was incredibly nice and cosy, way more than I expected. It was quite small, with its two individual dorms, and not too full of furniture, but it had a homely and soft vibe that made me feel comfortable as soon as I set a foot inside. The views weren't as astonishing or beautiful as the ones from the Burrow or Grimmauld, but still, it was warm and welcoming. Once Remus showed me the room where I'd be staying, he put a The Beatles vinyl record on his old gramophone and prepared hot coffee for both of us. We sat at one of the windows with our mugs and the music in the background."Dora will be coming later, I bet you wanna see her, don't ya?" he said, after a couple of minutes in silence."Yes! I'd have seen her sooner if you had let me.""You know I'm not planning to risk you, Lilith. It's already dodgy enough to let you go freely through Diagon Alley and the Quidditch field if the Harpies finally get you in.""I'm not restraining myself because of the bloody Death Eaters. Besides, there hasn't been any other move lately, has it?"Remus sighed and started to give me every single detail the Order discussed since it formed for the second time. There had not been any other attack, but the Wizarding World was fuming with Fudge and they were demanding him to quit his position as Minister. Not that I felt pity for him, the man had been completely useless..."And do you think they're going to attack again?" I questioned, gaining an ironic snort from Remus."You tell me."I wondered if I certainly knew the Death Eaters as well as I thought I did."I think they might try something against the muggles. The Wizarding World is getting ready whether to join them or to fight back, the muggles aren't expecting anything. Also, it would get them more attention and fear."Let It Be started to fill the place with its soft melody and Remus let out a long sigh as a nostalgic smile covered his face."You know? Sirius used to love this song. We danced it together thousands of times at Hogwarts," he confessed, letting out a little snicker as if he was reliving those memories. I couldn't help but smile and grab his hand to caress it. "We did again one time at Grimmauld, for his birthday.""That's so beautiful, Remus..." I whispered and he kinda blushed. I quickly spoke again, avoiding making him uncomfortable. "But I'm not surprised Sirius loved this song. I don't know a single person who doesn't like The Beatles."A bigger smile formed on the man's face, still with his eyes lost. "A good old friend of mine used to say that nothing can go wrong when you are listening to The Beatles," he spoke paused. "And he was right, I have their songs all attached to only good memories.""Was he the same old friend who gave you so good advice and the guitar Fred and George now own?"He snickered and after a while, nodded. "You would have liked him, and he would have adored you.""I wonder what's his name..." I smiled at him.Remus was about to answer but before he could, we saw a white dot in the sky approaching us. The man by my side opened the window as soon as he noticed it was little Iris the one arriving with a letter in her beak."It's Draco's response!" I announced, starting to decipher the code the letter had. Before leaving the Burrow, I managed to send a coded letter to Draco, enchanting it for him to be the only one who could read it."What does it say?" Remus tried to read over my shoulder, but frowned his eyebrows, confused, once he noticed he couldn't understand it. I read it out loud for him;

Lilith;

Father is still imprisoned, I'm constantly controlled by my aunt Bellatrix and by my mother. They don't want me to hear their conversations but I have managed to know that I might be in danger. My mother suggested talking to Snape, I hope she was referring to your uncle, and Bellatrix tried to convince her not to, which made me guess that whatever they are getting me into, it has to do with the Dark Lord. For your protection, I'll be abstaining from writing to you or even mentioning you. I'll try to visit you alone at Diagon Alley, where I hope we can speak freely, before the start of the new course.

Stay safe.

Loving you and missing you,

Draco L. Malfoy.

P.S; please, do not worry about me. Whether I'm actually in danger or not, I don't want you to make any foolish movement. I promise I'll tell you everything.

"Is he becoming a Death Eater?!" My voice trembled, crumpling the paper between my hands."No, no, I don't think so. Keep in mind these sentences; ' I might be in danger ' and ' whatever they are getting me into ' "Remus quoted, while sitting again. "Maybe Voldemort has the Malfoys threatened. After all, it was Lucius's duty to get the prophecy and he did not only fail but also got caught by the Aurors.""Do you think he might be trying to punish Lucius and Narcissa by using Draco?" I asked, feeling a big knot in my throat and completely powerless. I still had that need to protect the blond boy, to keep him under my care and away from his parents' reckless and motivated by bigotry decisions."Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me. He doesn't like mistakes."I sighed hardly, "Remus, I have to do something. I can't let them hurt Draco."But the man tutted, "Keep your mind clear, Lilith, and think like the Slytherin you are. What's the best choice?"The words came immediately out of my mouth; "To stay out of it for the moment. Bellatrix is the biggest fanatic of You-know-who but Narcissa would never let him hurt Draco. I'm not very sure about Lestrange but I bet Narcissa would try anything to evade whatever punishment He has for Malfoy.""That's right. Besides, you know Draco is way intelligent than many people think.""He knows how to take care of himself. Also, after what Harry told me at the Burrow, if I make them notice me, I'd drag my mother's attention.""And we, certainly, don't want that."Even though I still wanted to run to the Malfoy Manor and drag Draco out of there and protect him, I nodded and finished the already cold coffee from my mug.✵ ✵ ✵The week at Remus home went by quicker than I thought. I was incredibly comfortable around him and every two days, Tonks came to spend time with us. I had missed her so much and I was so happy to have her around me again, that I almost glued myself to the woman every time she was at the flat. Lupin continued being as caring and protective as he had been and made sure I was comfortable. He also started to show me every clue and every progress the Order was doing, to make me an active member in it.On Friday, Remus took me and my trunk to the most famous magic street in London, where Liv was waiting for me at the porch of a big building, more exactly 92 Diagon Alley. Our new home was waiting for us."Finally! Morning!" the blonde girl opened her arms to hug me as soon as we pictured each other in the distance. She had a couple of keys in her left hand and her trunk by her side."My fault, I couldn't find my suit, we would've been earlier here otherwise." Remus excused while I hugged tightly Liv between my arms. "Have you got inside already, Liv?""No. Dad did yesterday and he came back home saying he loved it.""It's in a good location, in the middle of the Alley," I observed around and my eyes focused for a minute on the building next to ours. It was a purple one that seemed to be under construction. "What's this?"Liv turned around to give a quick look at where I was pointing. "Oh, I heard's a new shop, don't know of what, though. It used to be an old robes shop but the owner died. Dad said his children wanted to get rid of it soon so they sold it, it was bought a few weeks ago.""Shall we enter your new home, ladies?" Remus asked, getting our attention back and grabbing the keys from Liv's hand to quickly open the big door."The building is empty except our flat. It used to belong to the same man but I already told you how dad got it." Olivia explained as she made us get upstairs. We ended up on the fourth floor. The wood door opened and we found a clean, 70s inspired, cosy and well-illuminated apartment, way bigger than what I expected.My mouth opened widely and I heard Liv snickering of pure surprise."Oh, dear Godric..." Remus whispered, covering every corner of the place with his eyes. "Girls, this place is absolutely beautiful! What a taste your father has, Olivia!"It was incredibly beautiful, with big windows, enough space for the two of us and a really warm vibe that instantly got me."Liv, this is completely perfect. I fucking love it!" I opened the dorm's door to have a look inside of them. One of them had white walls with some plants decorating them, a huge window and a bed that looked incredibly comfortable. The other one had also white walls, a very little balcony of which window looked to the next building, and a big bed as appealing as the one in the first room. This was mine."I want this one!" I announced, quickly dragging my trunk to it. Liv laughed and let out an excited little scream when she saw closely the room that was going to be hers.We spent the rest of the day accomodating our stuff. Soon, the walls in my room were covered by my Slytherin ties, pennants and flags along with some Quidditch posters; including the one Remus got me from the Harpies, some posters of muggle bands, candles and the notes people wrote me that I used to have also hung at my dorm at Slytherin. I put my drawing notepad on the nightstand next to my bed and magically put all my clothes in the big wardrobe.Remus appeared soon at the door, leaning against the frame as he observed my room."It's so lovely, dear," he observed the entire space grinning. "I'm making dinner, Xenophillus was smart enough to bring you two some food at some point during the morning.""Thanks, Remus!""Oh, I also have something for ya," he continued while rummaging in his pockets. He finally took whatever he was looking for and put the tiny object over one of the nightstands that remain untouched. "Liv told me your old gramophone stopped working. I know you own a cassette player but I made appear something from Sirius's home I reckon he'd have liked you to have it. Besides, if his house is now actually the property of Bellatrix, I highly doubt she'd miss this."Performing an Engorgio, Sirius's old but well-treated gramophone took back its original size in front of my eyes."Oh, Merlin, Remus!""Now it's yours," he smiled, happily, and I ran to hug him, thanking him for everything he had done.I got out of my room, giving a quick gaze at Liv's which was decorated with some of her Hufflepuff stuff, more plants, pictures of me, Luna, her dad and Pauline, muggle novels, some of her clothes hanging from the ceiling just like she did at the Lovegoods house, and that constant smell of cookies and honey her room at Hogwarts used to have.We had dinner with Remus and then he left us since Dora was waiting for him at his place - whatever weird thing they had on was waking up my curiosity but I rathered not to ask so soon -. Liv and I were so excited and happy about being finally together at our own home that we kept awake until past midnight."Can you believe we are finally here?!" Liv shouted with pure excitement, letting herself fall on our couch.I quickly laid beside her, letting the music from my room fill all the space in the house. "It feels like a bloody dream..." My cheeks hurt because of how much I kept smiling during the whole day. It actually felt like a dream."Next week I'm going to enrol at Uni. To start studying Psychology this September. Dad told me there is a special hidden part for wizards and witches in all muggle universities and it validates our marks from the wizarding schools with the muggle ones. I can't wait!""That's great! I think I might go on Monday to the Quidditch field to start training. Heard no one will be using it until the tryouts in September."We kept chatting till it was 2 A.M. It didn't matter how many years we had been friends, how much time we spent together or what happened through the day; Liv and I always had lots of things to talk about.Letting myself fall over my new and comfortable bed, the only thought that kept me awake - against my will - was Fred. Will I see him soon? How much I will have to wait? Is he going to be in the Order's reunions? He has to. I bet he is. When is the next Order's reunion? I spurned those thoughts out of my head and concentrated on the music and the stars that could be seen from my window. Soon after, I fell asleep with the dim humming of the music from the record playing, feeling my fresh and soft sheets hugging me and trapping me into a comfortable dream. Luckily, it had passed almost two weeks since my last nightmare and I hoped it could stay like that.By the time I stood up from my bed, the sun was entering very slightly through my window, with the golden dawn light.I got out of my room, with a cig hanging from my lips ready to have my morning orange juice and my tea, humming very softly the song I fell asleep with, careful not to wake up Olivia. As I had the first sip my eyes went lazily to the window and I froze in my place.There was barely any distance between our building and the next one so I could see quite good parts of the flat in it. From my window, I saw a ginger boy entering the kitchen with no shirt, plaid pyjama trousers and messy hair, grabbing a mug and leaning against the counter with an almost finished cig hanging from his lips. His eyes met mine and he raised his eyebrows but didn't change the mischievous and still a bit sleepy smile on his face."Morning, neighbour." Fred Weasley murmured, loudly enough for me to hear him."What are you doing in there?" Stupid question."Sunny morning, innit?" he ignored me."Fred...""Isn't it obvious, darling? I live here," he winked, leaning against the window frame."That's your flat?!""Yeah, and the shop under its Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes," he smiled, with an obvious tone. "We will be opening in a month more or less.""Oh, Merlin!""Nice place you've got in there. Hope you can show it to me soon more in detail," he smirked, to then give a long sip to his steamy drink. "I can show you mine whenever you want."Another ginger head appeared behind Fred and his smile got wider. "Look who we have as neighbours, Georgie."George made a space for himself next to his brother and chuckled as soon as he saw me. "Lilith! Good to see you!""Merlin's balls! You've got to be kidding me!" I heard Liv laughing behind me, tieing her thin white robe around her body."Morning, Oli!" the twins said at the same time, waving at us."Good morning, boys," she said, pretty amused, as she got closer to me and still waving at them, she whispered in my ear. "And you thought you would miss him. HA!"Life is full of surprises...

The first thing I did on Monday morning was grabbing my broom and run to the empty Quidditch field to start training. I had missed immensely the adrenaline, the exhaustion in my body after beating the Bludger and the loops in the air flying on my broom. I hadn't touched it since Umbridge took it from me.Just when I had finished, I heard someone shouting my name from across the field and a familiar woman with purple hair waving at me. I ran towards the witch as soon as I recognized her and hugged her as tightly as I could."How did you know I was here? Is everything okay?" I asked, surprised to see her."Yeah, wanted to give you a little visit and found Oli at Diagon Alley, she told me you'd be here. We haven't spent proper time together in a while.""You're a bit busy with the Order, aren't you?""Sort of, but Remus already told me your address so you better be ready to have me in there often."I snickered, "My home is your home, Tonks, you already know.""You are training again, huh? Ready to be the best player in the Harpies?" she slightly punched my arm, friendly."I still have to get in the team, though. But yes, I have to do as much as I can to be in it and to be the best." I sat on the fresh grass and Tonks did the same. "I'm done for today, though.""Nice, I can invite you to a pint then.""Oh, please! I love Remus's teas and coffees but I'm missing a proper beer."She opened the bag she used to wear over her shoulder and took out two bottles she skillfully opened with a pair of keys. I took the first sip of the cold drink and laid back on the grass, feeling the summer sun on my face."So, how's everything going, mate?""I'm moving with Remus, you know?" she announced with a dreamy smile on her face. I opened my eyes widely and surprised while giving her another grin."In what are you on with my paternal figure, Nymphadora?" I teased her and she rolled her eyes, amused."Don't call me Nymphadora!" she started to tickle me and I almost spat the sip on my mouth. "I still don't know. I have feelings for him, that's obvs.""And he has feelings for you too." I guaranteed her. It probably wasn't like the kind of affection Remus felt for Sirius - which obviously had been only their business - but I knew Remus actually had strong romantic feelings for Tonks and actually wanted to take care of her and not hurt her. If that idea had gone through his mind, I don't care if he was Remus or not, I'd have kicked his arse."I hope so..." she giggled as soon as an idea went through her mind. "Off-topic but I've recently been in contact with Charlie Weasley, you know he's a good friend of mine, told me his brothers are opening a bloody joke shop!"I snorted remembering when I discovered Fred and George were my new neighbours. "Yeah, their shop is next to my place. Their flat is in the same building so we're neighbours now.""Good for you then! Can sneak into his house and have rough sex more often.""Tonks!" I snickered, giving her a soft punch in the arm. "How did you know?!""You think you could fool me, mate? I'm too old for that shit.""Well, I dunno, the last time we were together was in April.""That bloody much?! How can you last so much without it?!""Ugh, tell me about it, I'm getting tired of wanks."Her eyes brightened with a mischievous shine as she realised something she didn't tell me. Tonks finished her beer with a last long sip and gave me a little pat on my leg."C'mon, I want you to come with me.""Where?""I'm visiting a muggle friend that's gonna do me a favour in his shop. I think you'd like to see it and you might wanna do it as well, let's go."I put on more decent clothes than my sweated ones for the training and we walked together through the streets of London as two more muggle normal girls hanging out. After twenty minutes, Tonks finally stood in front of a tattoo and piercing shop with neon lights, smoke and 80s rock blasting in the background."What're you gonna do, Dora?"A huge smile filled her face;"I'm getting my nipples pierced!"✵ ✵ ✵"Shit, they are grazing my shirt," I complain, taking my hands to my breasts and softly caressing them through the fabric."Yeah, they're a bit painful, aren't they? Lucky for us we could take our bras off, otherwise, I bet they'd be even more annoying." Tonks said, imitating my action.After seeing how pretty the piercings looked on Dora's body and how much she convinced me, I finally decided to get mine pierced as well. At first, the needle felt incredibly painful but once I saw my reflection in the mirror...Fuck, it definitely had been worthy."Finally!" Tonks snorted once we entered Diagon Alley."Your friend said we have to heal them two times a day, right?"The witch looked at me surprised and with a puzzled smile as if she couldn't believe what I was saying."Yes, but that won't be necessary. Have you forgotten about healing magic?" she took her wand out of her boot and pointed to her own breast. Muttering a spell it seemed as if nothing had happened but she looked through the hole for her head, pretty proud. "Look! It worked!"She approached me and discreetly show me, extending the shirt a little bit to let me see. They were actually healed."Do it to me, please," I begged her and she pointed her wand at my breast. Fortunately, we were a bit distant from the rest of the people in the Alley and nobody seem to be noticing what we were doing. Not that Tonks would have cared anyway. "Wanna come home?" I invited her to go upstairs and she quickly nodded, interlacing her arm with mine.As soon as we entered the flat, I saw Liv sitting with Remus on our couch while drinking what seemed to be tea."Girls! Where've you been? Remus told me he had been waiting for you for a while, Dora. He said you two had an appointment." Liv said.The purple-haired witch took a hand to her mouth. "Shit, I forgot. We were supposed to be having dinner together, weren't we?"Remus giggled softly. "Yes, Dora, but don't worry, knowing that you were with Lilith I bet you had fun too. Besides, Olivia was kind enough to invite me to have tea and a good conversation with her. We can still have dinner at home if you want to.""What have you two been doing anyway?" Liv asked once I sat down on the couch by her side. "Have you been training all this time? You can't exceed yourself too much...""I haven't, don't worry. We were -" I gave Tonks an accomplice wink. "having a little bit of fun.""Yes! Remus, look!" Dora smiled like a little kid, lifting her shirt to show her new piercings as if it was the most natural and common thing on Earth.Olivia burst into laughter and I saw how she blushed, and Remus's eyes opened widely as he swallowed hard, also kinda blushed."Oh, Godric, Dora!" he chuckled, running her hands through his face."Cool, innit?" she pulled back her shirt."Y-yeah...very cool, but should be careful, somebody could have seen you!" Remus had a smile on his face and looked at Dora as if she was one of the biggest treasures to ever walk on Earth."Bah! Nothing they haven't seen by now.""Wait a moment-" Liv turned around to me. "Did you only accompany her?"I shook my head slowly and the blonde's eyes opened widely again as she took a hand to her mouth. "Oh, fucking Merlin, I knew it!""We should be going if we want to have dinner soon, Dora," Remus announced, getting up off the couch and putting on his jacket as the other witch nodded. "Girls, nice to see you again, and Oli, thank you so much for the tea."He hugged the two of us and when he had me in between his arms he caressed my hair. "I'll try to come again this week, okay? I love you so much.""Love you too," I hugged him tightly and finally let him go.Tonks got both Liv and me between her arms in a strong and warm hug and she kissed our cheeks to then ran back to Remus, leaving us alone.As soon as the door was closed, Liv gave me a little smirk. "Now, you better show me those piercings."I snorted but lifted my shirt to let her see and she observed them. "They look good...Fuck, Fred's gonna love them!" she giggled again, taking her hand to her mouth."Olivia!""What?! You know it's true. Wow, they actually suit you... Do you think Pauline would like them on me?""Probably. They hurt a little bit but with magic, you can heal them soon.""Maybe I try with just one at first."✵ ✵ ✵After having dinner with Liv and watching a new muggle program on our new telly, someone knocked on the door.I quickly stood up to open and found George Weasley with his big smile and kind eyes."Night, Lilith!""Good night, Georgie. Everything's fine?""Yeah! I've come to take Liv to have a beer at the pub, I promised her I would take her to the new one they opened near the Leaky Cauldron.""Oh, yes, I'm going!" Liv pulled on my leather jacket and quickly put on her boots."Wanna come?" George asked, looking at me."Oh, no, don't worry. I've been training all day. I might go straight to sleep.""You sure?" Liv spoke."Yeah, don't worry. But we can have a beer here tomorrow if you want, Georgie. You can bring the pain in the arse you have for a twin."The ginger chuckled and nodded. "Here at dusk?""Perfect.""Nice, see you then!""Don't set our house on fire," Liv warned me as she left with George downstairs."Fuck, you've ruined my plans, Olivia."I closed the door behind me and pulled down my trousers, staying on my panties and my shirt because of the hot summer night. Turning off the telly and lightening some of my candles, I went straight to my little balcony to have a cig. As soon as I opened the window, I found a familiar face on the other flat's balcony."Fred." I greeted him."Darling," he murmured, putting his cig between his lips and lightening, as he sat at the edge of the balcony giving me an up to down look. "Haven't seen you today."I put my cigarette in between my lips, peacefully lightened it and let out the first puff."I'd been training.""Oh, true, for the Harpies, right? I s'pose if you get in it I'll have to go and hype you, won't I? Kinda like your personal cheerleader."Oh, I hope you do."What about you?""I've been getting things ready at the shop. Barely had any rest today.""What a pity. I had mine. Tonks came to the field and gave me a cold beer, then dragged me with her to a tattoo shop."Fred's eyebrows raised, curiously. "Did you finally decided to get my name tattooed? What a lovely gift from you, dear.""Bah, you wished...Dora got two piercings." I started and then gave him a feline look. "And she convinced me to get them as well.""Oh, really? And where? I don't see anyone on your face."A mischievous smirk appeared on my face and took a long puff, almost finishing my cigarette."Oh, darling, I have them somewhere else..." I murmured, with the most seductive tone I could find. Fred narrowed his eyes, amused, and the devilish part of my mind purred at the idea of playing and teasing him again."Where do you have them then?"I step on the fag-end and threw it out. Then, under Fred's curious and entertained stare, I took my hands to my shirt, watching how his look turned darker and more intense. Slowly I lifted my shirt, showing the ginger my new piercings.His eyes covered every inch of my exposed skin and he breathed deeply."Fuck, Lilith - Whenever I think you can't get any better, you end up surprising me," he whispered with his deep and raspy voice, sending quivers all over my body. I pulled down my shirt again but his eyes kept in there and I couldn't help but smirk."I'm full of surprises, Freddie. What a pity you are not going to enjoy them tonight,"His eyes met mine, confused, and before he could say a word, I sneaked back into my dorm, closing the white curtains and letting myself fall on my bed, holding a snicker.Fuck, I loved teasing him.Not even two minutes had gone by when I heard a hit on the balcony's floor, scaring the fuck out of me. A tall figure entered slowly through the curtains, and Fred's smirk got wider once he saw me laying on my bed, looking at him completely shocked."Oh, darling, you really thought I was going to let this pass..." he whispered, amused."Did you jump through the balcony?!" I asked surprised, sitting at the edge of my bed."Of course, I've been nearly two months without you, you really teased me and expected me to just go back to my room and wank on my own? No, Lilith..." he approached me, with the moonlight hitting his back, looking way more fierce and wild. However, he slowly got in front of me and caressed softly my cheek letting his thumb ran through my upper lip and then to my lower one."You could have killed yourself you know?"He rolled his eyes, snorting. "There is barely any distance between our balconies.""I bet you fucking adore that, don't you?"He tilted his head to the left and raised one of his eyebrows playful and mischievously. Without any warning, he got on his knees and opened my legs to make space for himself and get closer to me. Placing his hands on my bed at every side of my hips, he gave me one of his wild and fierce looks that seemed to be devouring me and already fucking me. His eyes went from mine to my lips and he opened his mouth slightly, letting out a dim sigh."I'm not going to touch you unless you tell me you want it, Lilith..." he whispered, making me feel already soaked against my underwear. "Tell me, darling, do you want me to fuck you again?"I smile devilishly at him and grabbed him by his shirt, pulling his face closer to mine and grazing my lips against his as I spoke, watching him stare at my mouth and breath heavily;"You know full well it's a yes, Freddie," I murmured, with his smile going wider and his pupils dilated.His lips finally met mine in a burning, intense and painfully slow kiss. It had been so long since the last time I got to kiss him, that I wanted to fully enjoy the sensation and to carve in my memory the flavour of his lips and the broken and hypnotic rhythm of his breathing. Noticing Fred's hands grabbing my hips and squeezing them as he started to get on top of me, I spread my legs to give him more space. Fuck, I had missed him terribly. One of his hands sneaked to my neck and pressed slightly while his tongue played with mine, claiming the control. Fred panted against my mouth when I bit his lower lip and he looked at me completely turned on.Time to play.

Fred surrounded my waist with his hands to put me in the middle of my bed. I pulled his hair gaining a raspy groan from his lips that got lost in mine."You have me so wrapped around your finger," he whispered in my mouth as he rocked his hips against mine, letting me feel his hardness through the sweatpants he was wearing.He started sucking the skin on my neck, leaving red marks that would definitely last, sneaking one of his hands inside my panties and caressing me slowly. A soft and muffled moan escaped from my lips as soon as I felt his burning touch on my skin. His fingers immediately found my clit and started making slow circles over it, driving my mind crazy."Freddie...""Let me see again those pretty piercings," he teased me, slowly taking off my shirt and admiring my exposed body before him. Fred licked his own lips, covering me with his eyes from up to down, hurrying up the movement of his thumb and inserting two fingers inside of me. "So bloody beautiful..."Every inch of my skin was claiming him and the over-sensitivity because of the amount of time without sex made me feel so touch-starved of him that I could barely think of something else that wasn't Fred fucking me.He smiled when he saw me tilting my head back. "Look at you, what a pretty mess..." he lowered himself to my body and cupped my breast, then quickly run his tongue through my nipple, playing with my piercings and sending quivers straight to my sensitive clit. Fred sucked, bit and kissed me, leaving me speechless."Fuck..." I murmured hoarsely once his fingers twisted and I noticed him snicker in the most seductive way I ever heard.Fred kissed my jawline to then stare straight into my eyes with that piercing glaze that disassembled me in the most beautiful way possible. "My pretty and needy Lilith..."I smirked at him and let my hands travel all over his torso, carving in my fingertips the memory of each of his exposed freckles, scars and moles until I reached the strap of his trousers and sneaked my hand inside, caressing him as tortuously as he had done with me. He tilted his head back, closing his eyes, and letting out a raspy moan from his dim smile."I bet you are so desperate to fuck me, aren't you, Freddie?" I whispered back, giving him a feline smile as I took my other hand to caress my breast under his intense look."Fucking yes I am."He took off my hand from my own breast and went back to suck it and kiss it, letting his tongue play with the piercing as his hands went straight to pull down his sweatpants, letting his dick free and already grazing against my wetness."I want you to look at me. I want to see your pretty face once I'm inside," he murmured, staring straight into my eyes and grabbing my legs to put them around his hips. Fred's thumb ran over my lower lip and I sucked it, keeping eye contact with the ginger. He groaned and adjusting his dick in my pussy, he pushed hard into me. We moaned in each other's mouth and I pulled harder his hair. "Oh, darling, you feel even better than the last time...""Fuck, Freddie, you are going to end me..." I scratched his back as he started to thrust harder and rougher. He tilted his head back again, closing his eyes harshly with laboured breathing. What a view...His hands dug on my hips and he pounded on me even faster and harder. "Moan for me, let all the Diagon Alley know who fucks you."A louder whimper left my lips when his thumb went back to play with my overstimulated clit and I glued Fred's body even more to mine, wanting to feel him even close as the mixture of pleasure and pain started to drive me crazy. The sound of his hips crashing against mine and our laboured breaths and moans turned into a bewitching melody that made me even weaker at him."Do I feel good, darling?" he panted against my lips."S-so good!" I trapped his lower lips against my teeth and he grinned."I'm about to feel even better," he winked at me and before I could react, he grabbed my hips and turned us around so now he was the one leaning on my bed and I was the one on top of him, making him go even deeper. A little whimper escaped my mouth as I felt him so hard against me.Fred used one of his arms as a pillow, marking his muscles and looking arrogant with that smirk covering his face while his hips moved slightly under me and his other hand went straight to squeeze my waist."Ride me, Lilith."I raised an eyebrow mischievously and place my hands on his chest to start moving in slow circles, watching Fred's face changing as a groan got out of his redder and swollen lips, taking both of his hands to my hips."Do you like it, Freddie?"He tilted his head back and let it rest on the bed while closing his eyes. "Y-yes, I fucking l-love it." he let out with a laboured breath as I started to move faster and taking his full size inside of me.My hand went straight to his neck and he hissed when I pressed. I loved to watch the effect I had on him."That's it, darling, fuck me," his hands cupped my breast and I bit my lip at the feel of his tip reaching my weakest spot. Not yet. " My beautiful whore - looking so beautiful when you ride me."I let out a cry of pleasure when I started to move my hips up and down, taking him even rougher and hearing him moan louder. Fuck, he felt so bloody good.The heat on the room felt unbearable and the moonlight on us made it feel even more intimate and sensual.His hands went to my hips trying to stop me. "You are going to hurt yourself if you do it so rough."I smiled at him, taking his hands off me. "Shut up and let me ride you properly, Freddie." I lowered myself briefly to kiss him messily and whisper against his lips as I ran my thumb over his lower lip, catching his piercing look again and the dim light shining in his almost black eyes. "I want to make you cum hard for me. So hard you forget your own name."I got back to my place and started going up and down slowly, keeping eye contact. He seemed pleased with my words because his hands went straight to my thighs and his eyes went down on me to observe how I let him go in and out.Feeling already a big knot forming in my lower belly, the wetness in me growing and every inch of my skin getting more sensitive, I made my movements rougher and faster, moaning even louder. Fred whimpered as he felt me clenching around him and his dick throbbing inside of me."F-fuck, Lilith..." he whined slightly, closing his eyes again and pushing his head harder against the bed, leaving his neck exposed and the veins in it and his hands marking more than ever. "What a beautiful slut, riding me so bloody well. " Fred murmured in his deep voice, having it more under control, and looking straight to my eyes.His fingers played again with my nipples and I grabbed his wrists to keep his hands there as I rode him as rough and fast as I could. Feeling his pulsating dick hitting hard against my weak spot, the pressure in between my legs, and hearing Fred's pants of pure pleasure, I tightened myself around him coming hard with the goosebumps hitting me, letting out loud a last high-pitched and raspy moan that filled the room. The quivers covered my entire body but I didn't stop.Still riding him with my orgasm taking me to the edge and the over-sensitivity in my body, I watched Fred becoming weaker and letting out another whimper. He dug his hands on my hips and gasped in his own moan as he started to release himself inside of me."That's it, Freddie, cum for me like the desperate slut you are," I teased him, watching him bite his lip smirking as his eyes were focused on where our bodies were united.He came so hard inside of me that I felt his cum slipping out so I make him get out of me, and looking at him straight in the eye, I ran my tongue through his hips, cleaning him and hearing his last hoarse and raspy moan fill the room. With his shiny eyes, he trapped my body into his, making me fall over his chest."You are so bloody amazing, Lilith" Fred whispered leaving soft and slow kisses all over my cheeks.I snickered, "Was the waiting worthy?"He chuckled back with his deep voice as I started to kiss him back. "Every time with you is worthy, darling.""I can say the same," I murmured with a sleepy smile as I watched his grin get wider and his chest filled with pride."Did I hurt you? You went a bit too rough..." he asked me, genuinely worried, and I almost melted right there."I'm totally fine, Freddie. The important thing is that we both liked it.""Good," he smacked my bum and tried to reach the pack of cigs over my nightstand. "Wanna share one while we recover, darling?"I nodded while standing up to grab a tissue from my nightstand and clean myself a little bit. Then, I threw myself back to my bed and felt Fred's arm around my waist, dragging me against his body to lay my head on his chest. The only touch of his skin against mine, the hearing of his breathing and his smell covering my dorm made me feel at home and made my heart race again. I ran my index nail from up and down his chest while putting one of my legs over his and watching Fred lightening his cigarette. He took the first puff and taking his eyes back to mine he put another cig on my lips and lightened."I needed this so much," he whispered looking at me, making my heart race even more. Don't tell me that, Freddie, don't get my hopes high."Bet you've been tired, haven't you?" I asked, playing cool and making my voice sound normal."Yeah, I've been working in some new creations-" his eyes brightening with mischief in them and a dim smirk appeared on his face. "Creations I'm planning to try with you." he bopped my nose.I chuckled, letting the smoke out of my lips slowly. "Bloody hell, we just fucked and you are already thinking about the next time, Freddie? Do I turn you on so much?" I teased him and he arched one of his eyebrows, amused."I can't get enough of you, Lilith, you already know," he murmured, breathing the smoke and letting it out in my lips to let me breathe it from him. "I would go on a second round if it wasn't because I know Liv and my dear twin went out together and might arrive at any minute.""And you want you to be the only one listening to me, right?""Exactly," he kept his face closer to mine as his eyes went down to my lips and his hand caressed me from my waist to my hip. "I've missed you so much to be sharing you."I snickered and he trapped my lower lip in between his teeth to then let it out."I really meant it when I told you you can't imagine how much I've missed you, Lilith," he continued, amused. "I've thought about you so much and wanked with you on my mind so many times it started to be pathetic.""Oh, Merlin," I laughed, hiding my face in the space between his neck and his collarbone."But I didn't miss you only in a sexual way."My heart stopped briefly."Oh, really?" I pretended to be calmed, even though the devilish part of me was whooping with pure joy."Aha, I found myself missing spending time with you. Like this, just chatting and smoking." Fred continued, with his calm and soft tone, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. "I missed seeing you at the Hall, or watching you at class, or raising my eyes and finding you talking to Liv or the insufferable of Malfoy. I've missed seeing you every day and bothering you. You know, that sort of daily things." he chuckled, glueing me more to his body."I've missed that kind of things from you too," I confessed, feeling my heart pounding in my chest. "I s'pose it was because we saw each other every day this last year - you know, at Hogwarts and then during summer and Christmas - even though if we didn't talk every single one of those days."He was about to reply but the door of my room opened widely and Fred quickly pulled my sheets over our naked bodies."Oh, shit, sorry!" Liv covered her eyes with her hand and I saw her blushing hard and snickering. "Shit, I thought he was gone by now. George! They're still here, you owe me three galleons!" she got out of the room, running back to the living room."Fuck, they caught us." I giggled, hiding my face behind my hands. Why did everything had to happen to me?I quickly stood up and put on my white summer robe around my body, tieing it. Fred pulled on his boxers with an amused smile on his face. We got calmly out of my room and found Liv and George sitting on the couch with mischievous smiles on their faces and their eyes opened widely, looking like little kids who had been told off."I thought you two were going out for a beer." I started, looking at the two of them with a little smile on my face, putting my hands on my waist."Oh, and we were but, if you haven't noticed, it has been a whole hour and a half since then and I got a bit tired." Liv started, faking innocence, but she couldn't fool me. I knew the bitch I had for best friend."Besides, Liv said you were probably going to see Fred since you didn't want to come with us," George added giggling, putting his arms behind his head and leaning more comfortably. "We both know you rarely reject a beer.""It wasn't planned." I quickly said."Yeah, whatever." George snickered, looking at Liv, accomplice."She's right, Georgie. It just happened." Fred added, sitting at the other side of Liv, letting the blonde be in the middle."Bah, what truly matters here is that we had fun in our way-" Liv pointed at herself and then at George, and then looked at me trying to hold back her laugh. "and you two had fun in yours.""Lots of fun!" Georgie added, winking at me while Fred smiled, running his hands all over his face."Yeah, we are lucky there aren't any more neighbours!" Liv snickered."I'm not going to let this one pass, Lovegood." I joked, letting myself fall in the space next to Fred while attempting to look threateningly at Liv. "You will see once our favourite French girl is here."She stuck out her tongue at me and giggled. "Oh, my dear sister, I love you so much but if I'm in my room with my girlfriend, you are going out of the home. "Fred and George both looked surprised at Liv at the same time because of how she talked, keeping her innocent and sweet tone, but I burst into laughter. "Merlin forbids me from interrupting you.""Don't worry, Lilith, we will take you to our flat," George said, while Fred put a hand on my thigh and winked at me."Thanks, Georgie! Do you hear that you bitch? They adore me." I went back to tease Liv and she chuckled."They can adore you a lot in their house while I am with my girl." she blew a kiss to me. "I still love you, though.""Of course you love me, Olivia." I arrogantly said, winking at her. The twins were watching us, amused, as if they were in a tennis match."Are you two all the time like this?" Fred asked, sorting his eyes from Liv to me."Yes, all the time," we both said at the same time."Who do they remind you to?" Fred grinned at his twin, who rolled his eyes with a smile on his face."Oh, shut up, you prick." George snickered and took one of the cushions to throw it to his brother. "And put on some trousers, for Godric's sake. I see you more times naked than to my own self. I'm gonna rip off my eyes one of these days."Fred complained but went to my dorm and came back with his sweatpants on again. We stayed chatting for a while and then the twins left to their flat through the window. What a thing we had discovered for them."Wanna sleep with me today?" Liv asked grabbing my hand and I quickly nodded. We ended up falling completely asleep in her big bed after talking and laughing together.What a fucking great day.

Some days went by and soon, we were in almost mid-July. The Wizarding World was still expectant before what He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was going to do next, but we all tried to avoid thinking about it too much and to live as if a magic war wasn't slowly forming."Put your leg a bit closer to mine," I guided Fred and he obeyed. He tried to look confident but I already had seen his weak spot.He had come, accompanied by Liv and George, to my training. And after beating his arse at Quidditch, showing him I was way better Beater than him, he wanted us to practice muggle combat again, thinking he would win me just because he was bigger and stronger. Both his twin and Olivia snickered at his words and sat down on the grass, watching the two of us.Fred tried to make me fall but he didn't notice he left his weakness exposed so I took advantage of it, and using his own strength, I grabbed his arm putting it behind his back and hitting the back of his knees with mine making him instantly fall. He rolled on the grass to end up laying on his back and the sun hitting on his face."Shit, Lilith," he complained, amused, hearing the burst of laughter of our accompanying."Told ya you shouldn't mess with her, mate," George said, to then give a long sip to his cold beer."You should've listened to your twin," I winked at Fred, offering my hand to help him to stand up from the grass."You distracted me," he tried to catch Liv's beer but she slapped his hand. Lately, the four of us had been bonding a lot and becoming closer."All is fair in love and war."I sat on the grass and laid back, enjoying the sunlight that we rarely had in England. I opened my eyes slightly to look at Fred - as I got the habit of doing so, unconsciously - and he was staring at my legs while biting his lip discreetly. A little smirk formed in my mouth. What a good day to be using summer clothes.Suddenly, I felt a weight falling over me and a familiar giggle."Tonks!" I hugged her, with my voice a bit out-of-breath because of the unexpected hit."Morning, people!" the purple-haired witch greeted all of us, still over me. "Came to give you a little visit and to tell you something," she looked at me. "But considering you four are here, I only have to say it once."We all paid full attention to her."In three days is my birthday, and honestly, this year I don't feel pretty much like doing a huge party, so, after I visit some of my muggle friends, I thought maybe we could have a couple of pints and joints.""We are in!" the twins burst at the same time."What a fantastic adult influence you are, Dora!" Liv chuckled, ironic, and Tonks winked at her."You're good, though?" I asked, surprised that she said she didn't want to do something bigger for her 23s."Yeah, sure! Just wanna have something calmer, you know?""If that's what you want, you'll have it." I shrugged, smiling at her. "But, you know what else would be fantastic?"She opened more her eyes, curiously."What?""If you get off me. I love you, Dora, but you're crushing my left boob."She giggled and rolled to the grass, grabbing my beer and finishing it in just one sip.✵ ✵ ✵I quickly stood up from the couch as soon as the knocking on my door was heard. Behind it, I found a smiley Tonks with the two twins by her side, showing me a plastic bag."We've brought the drinks," George said, getting inside."And the fun," Fred smiled, showing me a smaller bag that fitted in his hand, following his brother.We had decided Liv and I's flat was the best one to have the reunion since the twins' was full of their gadgets and creations.My eyes focused back on the witch, whose hair now was a mixture of blonde and brown. I raised my eyebrows surprised but she shrugged with a little smile on her face."Happy birthday, Tonks!" I jumped into her arms, hugging her tightly and covering her face with kisses. "Didn't Remus come with you?""Oh, no, he says he feels too old for this kind of fun," Dora rolled her eyes with a little smile on her face, entering the flat and hanging her leather jacket.I clicked my tongue, "He's only 36 years old, for Merlin's sake. I should visit him this week."Tonks threw herself into my couch and quickly picked a beer, starting also to mess with George, who was sitting on the floor, next to her. Liv got out of her room and smiled as soon as she saw all of us."You know who's coming next week?" she whispered to me while grabbing her beer."Pauline?!" I grinned at her, and my friend nodded, starting to blush. "Oh, shit, great! Haven't seen her in donkey's years!""She wants to study Politics here in England, maybe we end in the same university. You don't mind if she stays here, do you?""Bloody hell, Olivia! Of course not! What kind of question is that? She's my friend and your girlfriend. I know you miss her every single day."I felt a cushion flying over my head and quickly looked at Fred, who was giving me a fake innocent look."What was that for?" I chuckled, seeing his pupils already dilated."You aren't paying us attention," he simply excused himself, starting to do his joint. I rolled my eyes and took the herb from his hand, doing mine.Tonks smiled widely, closing her eyes and humming the song I had on my gramophone playing. "Happy 23s to me.""Cheers!" We lifted our beers and took a long sip. The first puff felt incredibly relaxing and I laid my head on Liv's lap.By midnight we were quite high, pretending not to be as much as we actually were, talking about the most ridiculous things."But think about, Liv, how do the muggles manage to drive that shit?! I tried when I was fourteen and crashed the car. They do it so effort-...wait, how do you say this?" George burped, slightly, trying to think the word. "Effortlessly. That's right."Liv snickered by my side. It turned out that high George was as obsessed with Muggle things as his father."I don't know, Georgie. Heard they go to a special school for it."The ginger's eyes opened widely, "Do they?! Wow..." he kept looking at the wall, trying to assimilate Olivia's words, looking like a sleepy 5-year-old.I moved on my place when I felt Fred's eyes on me. He was imitating my posture but laying on his twin's lap, something not so usual to see. He had a little smirk on his face and his eyes kinda narrowed, observing me. He had been like that for the last twenty minutes. When I couldn't help but look at him and a little titter escaped my mouth, he stuck his tongue out at me.I tried to concentrate on Tonks, George and Liv's conversation, but Fred's stare burnt me and the effect of the herb on me made every inch of my body even more sensitive to him. This room was a bit hot, wasn't it?"Now, my loves," Tonks stood up, messily, with a sleepy smile. "I had a great time with all of you. You are fucking amazing. But I should go, I promised my mum I'd visit her before 2 A.M and I don't want her to see me stoned as fuck," she snickered, putting her jacket on and grabbing her wand, ready to appear.She hugged all of us and when she got to me, she whispered in my ear;"Thanks for today, Lith. I love you so much."I froze a little bit in my place because the last time I heard someone calling me 'Lith' was from Cedric, but anyway, I hugged her back;"There's nothing to thank for, Dora. Love you more. "She nodded and quickly disappeared. Since the rest of us were still a bit too high, George laid on the couch, putting one of his arms on his face and Liv imitate him, resting her head over his belly."Shit, I'm not drinking ever again," the blonde spoke with an extremely Irish accent.George giggled, looking through the window. He had been giggling at the most simple things since his third puff.Leaving them over there, resting, I went straight to my dorm, not even bothering to turn the lights on, to turn off the gramophone. When I was putting Another One Bites the Dust back into its place, I heard my room's door being closed and felt on my waist a couple of hands as some lips covered lazily the space from my neck to my collarbone with warm kisses and a strong smell of the herb.A little and deep groan escaped from Fred's mouth when I pressed my bum against him and took my hand to his hair."What are you doing, Freddie?" I drawled, still with the effect of the joint in my body."I couldn't hold back myself," he whispered in my ear. "I've been wanting to do this the whole day."I rested my head on his shoulder leaving my neck more exposed to him."Liv and George are out there..."Fred turned me around and looked at me with his dilated pupils, shiny eyes and craving lips. He glued me more to his body and started to leave slow and short kisses all over my face."They are asleep;" he whispered against my mouth, making me melt at him. "Besides, from 1 to 10, how much do you actually care?"I smirked, "You sure they're asleep?" I asked him, catching his face in my hand to stop him from distracting me, he nodded. "And you promise we're not going to be too loud?"His smile widened, looking more dangerous. "Oh, darling, you know I can't promise you that," his hands went down to my hips. "But I can try,"I felt the tingles concentrating in between my legs. He had a huge effect on me I wasn't able to control.Letting out a long sigh, I trapped his lips into mine in a tortuously slow kiss that let us feel each other's flavour fully, mixing our breathings and playing with our tongues. His touch was warm and burning as always, but because of our condition, it felt lazier but also, more intense than ever.Fred cupped my bum making me surround his hips with mine and made us fall into my bed. I instantly opened my legs to give him full access and more space.He separated his mouth from mine, and caressing slowly my cheek, looking at me eagerly and with his swollen red lips, he murmured; "Before we start, I have something for you."I looked at him, confused, knowing that I was processing his words slower than usual."What is it?" I whispered.His eyes brightened with a mischievous shine on them, darkening and opening more while a tempting smirk formed on his face, looking like a lion who had just trapped his prey."Oh, darling," Fred started, grazing his lips against mine. "I have a new creation you're going to love."The quivers invaded my body and I felt it already craving him.Bloody hell.

Fred took his hand to the pocket of his jeans, showing me a weird gadget. It was of red matt colour, not too big, fitting perfectly in his hand, and it consisted of a handle with two buttons and the head of the object which had a tiny hole in the middle."What's this?" I asked, already feeling the tingles concentrating all over my body.His smile grew wider."This, my dear Lilith, it's called Burning Sucker and it's designed to give full attention to your clit, imitating the feeling of it being sucked and suckled. It works by vibrations and warming glands, and I can't fucking wait to use it with you."I felt the blood concentrating in my cheeks and my head going a bit dizzy. This man was going to end me soon."Then, what are you waiting for?" I gave him a provocative look while slowly running my tongue throw my lips. Fred's eyes scanned me from up to down and, breathing heavily, he pushed me slightly to make me fall on my bed to then take off his shirt and throw it at the floor."Open those beautiful legs, darling" he whispered, keeping the calm, as he stayed on his knees on the bed. I did so, giving him complete access to me. He didn't bother to fully undress me, simply lifted my skirt, caring to stroke my thighs on the way, and painfully slowly, pulled down my knickers, throwing them across the room.His eyes focused in between my legs, licking his lips and getting his face closer to where I was craving him."Once I put the Sucker on you, you'll notice it will adapt to your shape and size and it'll instantly start working. Also, you don't need to be holding it, it adheres to the body until you pull it off. The buttons in the handle are to regulate the velocity. I'm in control of it, by the way, and depending on which level you reach, your inner walls can vibrate too, which can be incredibly pleasant for both of us, " Fred explained, raising his stare to look at me briefly. Piercing eyes and a little smile. "Ready?"I nodded, taking off my shirt and throwing it away as well, staying on my skirt and my bra, while he spread a bit more my legs."Great, but before-" he murmured, and then made his tongue give a slow and intense pass from my entrance to my clit, gaining a loud gasp from my throat as the current of pleasure invaded me. Glueing me more to him, he kissed my pussy, lazily, as if he had all the time in the world while his hands caressed my breasts over my bra. Tasting me in his lips and making me even weaker at him. He smiled at me and ran his tongue through his lower lip."Freddie..." I whispered, touching his hand on my hip, silently eager for him to start.The ginger smirked and unhurriedly, put the gadget on my sensitive clit. He was right, as soon as it was adjusted on me, it started to work. My hand flew straight to clap my mouth to hold back the loud moan threatening to abandon my lips. Fucking hell, that felt good.The Burning Sucker had glued to me instantly starting to vibrate and suck my clit, letting the warming glands work as well making me even more sensitive and stimulating me more. It felt so intense and burning that the knot in my stomach started to form at a scary velocity as the wetness in me grew considerably. I heard Fred snickering at my reaction. One of my hands kept in my mouth while the other one trapped the sheets below me, squeezing them."Does it feel good, darling?""Y-yes," I managed to whimper in a low voice, moving in my place at the immense and overwhelming sensations. " Fuck, it's s-so - so fucking g-good."Fred, full of himself and with an arrogant smile, started to patiently kiss my inner thighs, sending more quivers all over my body. My heart raced in my chest and every inch in me felt like in a bonfire."We should speed it up a little bit, don't you think?" Fred teased, clicking the button. A  muffled moan escaped from my mouth and the ginger giggled against the skin of my thigh. "You should see yourself, Lilith... Looking so gorgeous while turned into such a mess."I cried out of pleasure, keeping my hand over my mouth when I felt Fred's fingers slowly tempting my entrance. I tried to move on my bed, but he used his other hand on my hip to hold me still.It was burning, intense, overwhelming, passionate and raw, all at the same time. Just like him.The goosebumps covered my skin as I felt my climax approaching. Every inch of my skin felt burnt, sensitive and overstimulated. Fred was staring at me curiously, but also eager and piercing. He knew he had all the control. He loved seeing me so at his mercy."Fuck it, I can't take it anymore," he mumbled, to then quickly get on top of me, making sure the Sucker was still working on my clit, grazing his lips against mine. When I pulled his hair with a little whine because of how much I was craving him, needing him, he kissed me furiously and messily, taking all my effort to follow his burning kiss. His hand went straight to my neck and he lowered his lips to my jaw, leaving me panting. "If I don't fuck you right now, I think I might explode."Still kissing my neck, he took his hands to his belt and his trousers rapidly, looking quite desperate. I grabbed the collar of his shirt and dragged him back to my lips, to kiss him as eagerly and messy as he had done with me. He managed to keep putting his pants and boxer slightly down, enough to free his throbbing erection.Fred grabbed his dick and made his tip ran from below where the Sucker was having me to my entrance. Feeling the vibrations coming from the gadget, he let out a muffled deep groan.Every place on my body was trembling and craving him, he adjusted himself and exactly just when he was about to push himself inside, a knock was heard on my door."Freddie, you in there?" George's sleepy voice could be heard. "I'm sorry for interrupting you, mate, but I'm feeling shit. The entire room's spinning.""Fuck, not now," Fred whispered, breathing heavily and closing his eyes. I whimpered slightly under Fred, feeling both of us throbbing at the anticipation for each other."He has drunk too much, Freddie. Better take care of him," I forced myself to say."Liv is also a bit too hammered, she's throwing up in the loo," George continued from behind the door.The moment we heard that, we both moved and Fred took the Burning Sucker off me - much to the most primitive part of my mind's dismay -. We started quickly to fix our clothes, quite messy.Before we got out of the room, Fred grabbed me by my neck and glued me to his body once again. He trapped my lower lip between his teeth and then let it out."Don't even think I'm done with you, darling," he murmured against my lips. "I've planned to make you cum with me inside of you and the Burning Sucker on your clit, and I'll do it. Sooner or later."I gave him a feline look, feeling overwhelmed only by his touch. "I hope you do.""You're wearing my shirt by the way," he drawled, still looking at my lips.I reacted and noticed Fred was shirtless so I attempted to take off the shirt but he stopped me."No, no, I want you to keep it. It looks better on you than on me, and I bet it'd look even better once I'm fucking you in it," he left a single short kiss on my lips and complained a little bit while opening the door. I followed him out and we found George sitting on the couch with his head in between his hands."Oh, George, are you okay?!" I asked - quite stupidly, he was obviously not feeling okay - worried, while sitting next to him.He raised his head and looked at me with a sleepy face and managed to nod."Yeah, yeah, I'm good," he slightly burped, opening his eyes widely, and putting a hand on his chest. "I just can barely walk on my own.""Come 'ere, mate," Fred said, putting his twin's arm over his own shoulders, to help him."Liv's still on the loo, she's almost as wasted as me," George giggled while he was being dragged outside by his twin. "Sorry for ruining your fuck."Fred chuckled and I bit my lip, amused. "Don't worry, mate. First things first."The sober twin opened the door and gave me one last piercing look."Lilith," he smirked,"Fred," I imitated his action, watching them go out of the flat to there appear back into his, because of the antiapparition spell I had put on mine thanks to Remus.Once the two of them were out, I quickly went to the loo and found Liv sitting on the floor with her head inside of the toilet bowl."Oh, Liv," I walked towards her and held her hair so she could puke freely. When she was done, I wiped her chin and cleaned her with some tissues, walking her to her room."Sleep with me, please, Lilith," she asked me with a sleepy tone and that Irish accent that became way more noticeable whenever she was drunk. "I'm sorry for ruining your time with Fred.""Just like George," I rolled my eyes while getting in her bed. "You didn't ruin anything, Olivia. You know you always come first."And I actually meant it, it didn't matter if it was Fred or any other person in the world, Liv always came first.✵ ✵ ✵The next week we started to be really busy. I was almost fully focused on the training and whenever I had some free time I went to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes to help the twins with the last details before the inauguration. I knew they were nervous even if they tried to hide it. The shop was their main thought.Pauline arrived a bit sooner before I got home after Wednesday's training, so I had the scare of my life when I opened the door and found Liv snogging someone on the couch."Bloody hell, now this is a proper welcome!" I smiled, making them separate as soon as they heard my voice. Liv blushed and Pauline smiled widely while jumping from the couch to run to me. I hugged her tightly. She was looking even more beautiful than the last time I saw her; her skin was slightly darker, her afro hair was stunning and decorated with some silver jewellery in it and her eyes shined with happiness."Putain, I've missed you so much, Lilith!""I've missed you too! I have a lot to catch you up with!"The three of us sat on the floor and kept chatting for the rest of the evening. I could finally confess my feelings for Fred in front of Pauline and she snorted, clapping."Finally! It took you a year!" the girl grinned, excited. "I knew from the moment you wrote me for his birthday that you were feeling way more for him than what you wanted to admit.""She didn't admit it for own will, though. She had to see how her Patronus turned into his to admit it," Liv explained, resting her head on her girlfriend's lap, who instantly started to caress her hair. The blonde look at the other girl with little sparkles in her eyes as if she was the most precious treasure on Earth and Pauline looked back at her as if she was some sort of an angel in front of her eyes. They were so beautiful together that I only wanted them to never separate again."Dieu, Lilith... that's such a beautiful and powerful way of love," Pauline murmured while caressing Liv's hand. "And have you told him?""No, I'm not ready and I don't want to ruin whatever we have with my feelings. I rather swallow them and stay how we are than ruin it only to know he doesn't feel the same -" I confessed, playing nervously with my nails. "I don't want him to leave me."Pauline hid the pity in her eyes by nodding with a little smile and grabbing my hand to caress it as well."That's completely valid, dear. You are in your full right. But I also have to tell you, if he doesn't love you back, he is a complete idiot. Fred doesn't know the precious diamond he has in his hands."Liv nodded and I threw myself to hug the two of them, hearing their giggles. "Oh, Pauline, you can't imagine how much I've missed you." I left lots of kisses on her cheek. "I love you a lot.""Love you too," she snickered."Oh, by the way, you two are coming next week to the inauguration of Fred's shop, right?""Of course!" Liv said."I never miss a party," Pauline added, " and I want to see you and Fred flirting. I never got to see it at Hogwarts without you two arguing or glaring at each other whenever you were near.""Oh, it's true!" Liv and I clapped our mouths at the same time. Shit, that sounded like a long time ago."Well, I guess you will see it, if not in the inauguration, in any other of the evenings the twins spend here. They are our neighbours."Pauline giggled, "Yeah, Livie told me. You're a lucky bitch,""Indeed," I smiled, standing up. "And you two are about to be another couple of lucky bitches because I'm leaving you alone. I'm having dinner at Remus's place."I pulled on my jacket, ready to walk out of the flat. When I was at the door, I gave the two girls the last smile."Have fun, be careful and all that" I winked at them, and they imitated me at the same time. Then, I closed the door behind me, letting them enjoy each other.✵ ✵ ✵The voices could be already heard from outside and the neon lights inside the shop could be seen from the windows. The line to get inside of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes's inauguration was so long that it almost reached the Leaky Cauldron, which was at the other corner of the Alley. Luckily for Liv, Pauline and me, since I had been helping the twins with the last details and helped them with some creations that required really advanced knowledge in Potions, we simply skipped the queue and got inside."Oh, Merlin!" the three of us let out, surprised.The store was incredibly beautiful; full of vibrant colours, noisy gadgets and a lot of action, giving a funny and mischievous vibe at the same time. Fred and George's vibe.There were lots of people drinking, talking and giving quick gazes at some of the items. Most of them were all Gryffindors who had been in Hogwarts during our time and Quidditch players who came interested by the special section dedicated to the sport."Hello, ladies," we saw Fred and George appearing in front of us at the same time with a huge smiles on their faces. They were looking incredibly good. Since this inauguration was more of a party than a proper inauguration, they looked more like any other person in here rather than the hosts - even though it was way clear it was theirs, since they had a huge figure of one of them in the entrance of the shop and their faces printed all over the place -."Boys, this is so bloody wicked!" Liv smiled, looking stunned."I didn't expect it to be so big!" Pauline added, leaning a little bit forward to see the stairs that went up to the other three floors in the shop."We knew we wanted it to be big and unforgettable," George started, with a huge smile on his face."And here we are!" Fred continued for him, with an excited expression."We wanted to tell you we hope you three have a great time. You are special guests to us and we want you to have the times of your lives while you are at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes," George started solemnly, making Liv snicker.Fred passed us three butterbeers and grabbed two more for him and his twin. While giving me mine, our fingers touched sightly and our eyes met briefly, surprised. His mere touch could send me currents and quivers and I could do nothing against it.Because of how busy he had been this last week and all the work before the inauguration, the little time we got to spend together was with George and Liv in front of us at the shop or simply sharing two or three words about the gadgets' working, so the desire accumulated in my body felt more burning than ever. Especially, because I was craving him to finish what he had started with the Burning Sucker. And deeply, I knew he wanted it as well.Fred smirked at me, giving me his wild and fierce look."Cheers!" George said, and we imitate him taking a long sip at our beers. I felt Pauline's elbow hitting mine and she sorted her eyes from Fred to me, winking. I smiled at her, arching one of my eyebrows and looking back at the ginger, who had been staring slowly from up to down at me. Amused, piercing and tempting.The party has begun.

The music could be heard everywhere in the building and all of us were admiring the exhibitions of different products the twins were doing. They actually had put a lot of effort into the shop.It was probably the only midnight, but almost everyone was already by their fourth or fifth drinking. Pauline and Liv were dancing together being hyped up by Angelina, Katie, Alicia and some other girls from the Gryffindor team.I took a long sip from my firewhiskey and went for a walk all over the shop. I was giving a look at the WonderWitch products when I heard Fred's voice behind me, immediately, I turned around and found him chatting comfortably with Sienna Plums. I couldn't help but feel a spark of rage in my guts but I tried to ignore it, even though it grew as I heard the girl's voice. I still remembered the rumours about how they would end up together eventually and that burnt me in the most awful way possible. They made a nice couple and had so many things in common, besides, she came from an important half-blood family and her parents were closely related to the Zonko family itself. Shit, she was in so many ways better for him than me. I hate her.My eyes met Plums's and she rolled hers once she recognised me, I tried to give her my most deadpan but also cold stare."What are you even doing here, Arambella?" she spat, clearly annoyed. Fred turned around to look at me as soon as Sienna mentioned me but I didn't look at him. "I'm starting to believe you have an obsession with the Weasleys...""Don't you have a boyfriend to annoy, Sienna? It looks more like you're the one obsessed with me, love." I replied, without moving, and keeping the cold tone.She furrowed her forehead, in annoyance."Me? Obsessed with you?" she snorted. "You wish. And I don't have a boyfriend anymore, maybe you can go after him and act like the whore you're. Perhaps he lets you suck his dick so you can please your Gryffindor obsession."I smiled ironic, approaching her slowly with my arms crossed as I noticed how Fred froze in his place."Sienna..." he warned her, muttering with his jaw clenched.The brunette girl gazed at him briefly, with confusion. "Freddie?""Don't call me that, only George can."Ding, ding, ding! Point for Lilith."You know, Plums? I'm not surprised you're not dating Alton anymore, it takes balls to bear with a bitch like you."She scowled and crossed her arms as well."For Godric's sake, don't you have a fucking Death Eater mother to join? Why don't you go to the Malfoy Manor and bother them? Godric knows what sort of things you have to do for them to bear with you, Arambella. Bet Lucius Malfoy has you on your knees every day!"The rage finally took over me and with my cynic smile still on my face and every place in my body claiming to break her face, I approached her more with my fists clenched. The confidence in her face dithered and she gave three steps back but when I was about to jump at her I felt a couple of strong hands around my waist, holding me back."Ah-ah, you're staying here," Fred tutted, glueing my back to his chest. I glared at him because of the unreleased anger in me and a little smile formed on his face as he narrowed his eyes. He lowered himself a bit to whisper near my ear. "Don't look at me like that, Lilith, or I'll make you regret it.""I don't obey you and that bitch has me too fucking fed up.""Oh, you don't obey me? Wanna see how you will obey me once I drag you to one of the empty rooms? " he whispered again and without giving me time to respond, he looked back at Plums, calmly. "Sienna, it was nice to see you, but I'd thank you if you stop messing with Arambella. She is not what you think."Plums snorted, ironic. "Yeah, of course, I should have known she has tricked you as well. Bye, Fred, I'm gonna see if at least I can knock some sense into George," she started to walk away without giving me a second look. Once she was going downstairs I grabbed Fred's hands and put them off my body."Hands off me," I murmured coldly and he snickered, putting them in the pockets of his trousers.I was so full of anger that his calm and amused expression only raged me more. "You look so fucking hot when you're mad.""Shut up, Weasley,"His stare darkened but his amused expression didn't change, however, his words came out sharper and piercing, like a snake's hiss. "Careful, Lilith..."Trying to ignore the tingles growing inside of me, I clicked my tongue and walked downstairs, back to Liv and Pauline, who immediately handed me a beer I almost finished in a sip."You good?" Liv asked me while her hands surrounded Lin's waist to hug her from behind."Yeah, just Plums being a fucking bitch as usual," I told them the comments Sienna made, and while Liv had a disgusted expression on her face, Pauline looked really annoyed.Liv tightened her lips. "Ignore her, she is just too childish to even function.""What a pity Fred didn't let you break her face, girl. That woman needs to learn some manners, I don't understand what kind of problem she has with you."They managed to erase the bad mood in me and let me enjoy the party properly, drinking and dancing with them. Soon, even Angelina, Katie and Alicia joined us.I was dancing with Johnson and Bell pretty close when George got in between us, dancing as well, making us giggle."Aren't we the sexiest sandwich to ever exist, girls?" he asked us while putting his hands around Angelina's waist and dragging her closer to him, making the girl titter. "You look gorgeous today, Angie.""So do you," she replied in a confident smirk. I looked at Liv surprised and she shrugged smiling. Who would have guessed Georgie had a thing for the beautiful Johnson?The ginger decided to make a little contest between Liv, Angelina, Katie, Alicia and him to know who could take the largest shot of firewhiskey in less time. Since Pauline was still drinking her beer, I started dancing with her and soon, I felt someone's stare over me. Quickly lifting my eyes I found Fred's on me from across the place, piercing and covering me from up to down."Wink at him-" Pauline suggested mischievously in my ear. "And move your hips against mine. We made him jealous once, we can make him jealous twice."I smirked at her and did so, the smile on his face faded and he bit his lip while lowering his eyes to my hips. Not even five minutes went by when I felt saw Fred approaching us. Pauline snickered and turned us around to then quickly walk away, not without giving me a little kiss on the cheek, whispering;"Have fun!"I smiled at her and immediately noticed one of the ginger's hands in my hips, squeezing a bit as he tipped up the bottle of firewhiskey in his other hand to drink from it, making some drops run from his lips down his jaw and his neck. Fuck, I wanted to lick them. His corporal heat behind me made me feel goosebumps and the wild look in his eyes sent quivers all over my body."Want some?" he pointed at his bottle and I nodded. A little smirk appeared on his face as his hand went up to my neck making me tilt my head back, I opened my mouth and he poured the drink in it.Looking at me carefully, his eyes went straight to my lips and his face got a bit too close to mine."You can't imagine how much you're turning me on," he murmured, closing his eyes and rubbing slowly his nose against mine."Freddie, everyone can see us..." I arched one of my eyebrows, amused.He breathed heavily, still with his eyes on my lips; "I don't give a fuck."Without letting me time to reply and his hand still on my neck, he turned me around to face him and slammed his lips against mine in a desperate and demanding kiss, claiming every part of me and burning me, letting me taste the firewhiskey from him. I moved my hips against his at the rhythm of the music, hearing him groan in approval.I tried to keep going with the kiss, but suddenly, I felt my clothes soaked on my back. I turned around surprised and found Sienna with a bitchy smile on her face and an empty glass.Oh, she did not..."Sorry, Arambella, thought you might be a bit heated," she hissed, imitating my cynic smile."You're pretty much done, you bitch," I said calmly, ready to drag her out of the shop and erase that fucking winner smile from her face."Can't you fucking learn how to behave like a normal person, Plums?" Liv hissed behind her, rolling her eyes."Oh, shut up, Lovegood, there's nothing normal about you," the brunette spat and I quickly took my wand off my boot and pointed at her when I saw Liv's eyes widening. But before I could curse the bitch, Fred took my wand from me and put it in his pocket while starting to walk me out of there.I was trying to get rid of his grip and to writhe but a proud and shocked smile appeared on my face when I saw Liv slapping Plums. Hard. So hard that the girl's cheek was redder than ever and she stumbled on her feet. I think I've never seen a prouder smile on Pauline's face or George laughing so loud.The view was interrupted by a door being slammed in front of me. I looked at Fred again full of rage;"What was that for?" I muttered. He let out a sigh."I can't let you fight her, Lilith...""Why not?!""Because you are going to break her face!""Yeah, that's the whole point!"He snickered, "Look, I don't care if you curse her or fight her, ok? She genuinely deserves it," his tone got softer. "But not in my shop, darling. Not the opening night, at least."I processed his words and understood him. It was Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes's first night, people's opinions were too important and the twins had worked too much here to have destroyed so soon the good reputation they might get. I looked around and found out we were in what seemed to be his room. He didn't even turn the lights on since the moonlight was clear enough to see each other in the dark."This's your room? How we got here?""I appeared us.""What? I didn't even notice!""Yes, you were a bit too blind with rage to notice anything."I clenched my jaw, "Give me my wand."He seemed to be ignoring me because he opened his wardrobe and threw at me a shirt."Put this on until your clothes are dry."Since the cold drink soaked in my clothes was actually annoying me, I did so, only staying in my underwear and the shirt that was big enough to cover me."Fine. The wand.""Not until you calm down," he said playfully and a huge desire to erase that smile from his face appeared in the deepest part of my mind."I'm calm, give me my wand!"He giggled even more amused, "Yeah, I can see it," he ironized, making me snort. "You look good on my shirt, you know?""You're such a pain in the bloody ass! Why don't you go behind Sienna and console her? Bet she would love it, wouldn't she?" I said deadpan, crossing my arms in front of my chest. Fred narrowed his eyes."For fuck's sake, Lilith" he murmured, keeping the calm tone, but looking more threatening. I didn't flinch. " You don't know what you're talking about, shut up."Oh really? MAKE ME," I spat, arching one of my eyebrows.Something changed in his expression and a wild bright appeared on his face. Fred surrounded my waist with one of his arms and turned us around to pin me against the wall. Before I could say another word, he kissed me furiously and eager, silencing me and making me pant against his lips."Oh, darling, you chose a bad day to be a brat," he whispered against my lips, with a smirk on his face and grabbing my legs to put them around him. He moved his hips against mine, making the fabric of his jeans rub against my underwear. "I'm going to erase that fucking attitude from you in the best way I know."He went back to kiss me again, playing with my tongue and claiming dominance while slowly letting his other hand sneak below the shirt to caress torturously slowly my clit over the knickers. A soft and dim moan escaped from my lips and drowned in his.Fred separated from me and giving me a piercing stare, he bit his lip."On the bed, Lilith. I'm going to finish what I started at your house."I opened my eyes widely but with the butterflies on my stomach going wild."And what if I tell you I don't want to?""I would know you'd be lying, but I'll simply return you your clothes, let you sneak back to your home from my balcony without anyone seeing and go to the bathroom for a cold shower. Is that what you want, darling? Because the Burning Sucker is waiting for you..."I smiled and slowly, before his craving eyes, walked to his bed and let myself fall over it, crossing my legs. Fred's eyes covered me from up to down with a dim smile on his face as he walked to one of his dresser's cushions to grab the Sucker. As soon as I saw the gadget in his hand, I felt every inch of my body awakening and craving it.He opened my legs, sliding in between them and going straight to kiss and suck the skin of my neck while his hands went to slowly pull down my knickers, caressing me in the process while I took off his shirt. The ambience of the room was starting to get hotter, and Fred's wild gaze had me so weak that I couldn't think of anything else that wasn't him."Freddie..." I whispered, against his lips."What do you want, Lilith?""The Sucker..."He smiled and while kissing me, he spread more my legs and put the gadget's mouth straight in my clit. Quickly, it adapted to me and started working, gaining a loud and hoarse moan from my mouth that made Fred snicker proudly. Shit, that was so good. The vibrations and suction sent quivers all over my body and the heat made my wetness grow, it felt like an intense and swift jump into the peak of the rollercoaster. I whimpered when I felt Fred rapidly pulling down his trousers and boxers while one of his hands kept caressing my hip.He started to stroke himself, making me breathe heavily and showing me a tempting view. "You're the fucking paradise, Lilith."He clicked the button in the Sucker making it go faster. A high-pitched whine escaped my mouth and I squeezed the sheets below me. Fred grabbed himself and started rubbing his tip in my entrance, letting out a soft moan at the feeling of the vibrations."Look at you, such a beautiful mess," he lowered himself to leave soft and short kisses in my jaw as his hand sneaked below the shirt to squeeze my waist making me moan as the Sucker kept working on me. I was so close. Without hesitation, Fred pushed hard, getting inside of me in a single thrust.The feeling of him filling me along with the vibrations and the heat made me moan even louder at the same time as Fred, whose raspy and deep voice took me to the limit as he started to move slowly.He licked his dry lips and closed his eyes harshly while putting his hand in my neck and pressing."Fuck, Lilith..." Fred let out a laboured sigh, starting to push deeper, crashing his hips against mine. I could feel my walls vibrating against him and the effect it was having on the ginger. "Your pussy feels so fucking good."My nails dug in his back and he hissed, moving slowly, letting me feel him completely."Fre-ddie...- I'm a-about to -" my own gasp and followed moan interrupted me as a huge orgasm invaded my body, clenching around him and feeling the goosebumps covering me as my mind went dizzy. Fred smiled and lowered himself to trap my lower lip in between his teeth to start thrusting harder but slowing down the speed to let me feel him completely."We have just begun, darling," he whispered, out of breath, amused and keeping eye contact with me. "You look so beautiful when you cum. All only for me."He groaned against my lips and pulled out of me, gaining a complaining whimper from me. I needed him. It wasn't enough. He smiled and grabbed my hips to turn me around, making me stay on my knees and my hands. Fred caressed slowly my back, opening more legs and making me rest my face over his pillow."Ah-ah," he tutted, playfully, pulling my hair to make me look to the front and find a mirror. Fred was looking at me through it with a mischievous smile on his face that turned me on even more. "I want you to see your little pretty slut face when I make you cum. Keep your eyes there, Lilith."He dug his hands in my hips and pushed his dick inside of me again, harder than before, my eyes almost closed and rolled back at the current of pleasure that invaded me and a dim whine left Fred's lips as I saw him closing his eyes and tilting his head back."Eyes on me, darling," he murmured, out-of-breath and hoarse voice, starting to go fast again as the vibrations and heat felt more intense and closer to us. "So - fucking -" he groaned, making his thrusts deeper with each word," good.""Mmh, Freddie -" I moaned, feeling my mouth dry and him in every inch of my body, claiming me and making me his. Fuck.He ran his tongue following the path of my spine from down to up as his hands dug more in my hips, squeezing, making me arch my back more to give him even more access and let him go even deeper. The sound of his hips crashing against my skin and the melody of his laboured breath along with the raspy moans was bewitching me into a dizzy but pleasant mind-state. He had me so at his feet.Fred smacked my bum and squeezed it as hard as he had done with the skin of my hips. I whimpered as he rocked his hips faster, rubbing my weak spot."My beautiful slut," he groaned, lowering himself to kiss my back and bite softly the skin in it while sneaking one of his hands to the Sucker and speed it more. I whined with pure pleasure, feeling my clit being overstimulated. "Such a good whore only for me."I looked at him through the mirror and gave him a feline smile and gaze. "You feel — s-so fucking amazing, Freddie," I clenched myself around him, making him feel the vibrations even more and gaining a loud deep moan from him as his breath became more erratic. "Always fucking me this good."He let out a raspy groan of pleasure and squeezed my hips again at my words, noticing how he was already out of breath. "Fuck, Lilith, you disassemble me."I let out a low snicker that got interrupted by a gasp when Fred reached again my weakest spot and sped once again the Sucker in my clit. Fuck, I was reaching the bloody stars.My body slightly trembled and my walls clenched around him again, as my second orgasm invaded me with a loud whimper, taking me into a long and burning climax that left my body numb."That's it, my darling," Fred whispered. Before my orgasm could completely abandon me, feeling my own juices going down my thighs, the ginger turned me around again, letting me see his dark eyes and his opened lips. He grabbed my legs to put them over his shoulders and pushed into me again. Making me so fucking oversensitive."F-fuck, Fred! ""One more, Lilith-" he swallowed hard, pounding rougher and faster into me, going as deeper as before. He was nearly out of breath. "Let me make you cum for me only one more time."I pulled his hair and made him slam his lips into mine. I bit his lower lip and he whimpered against me, making his hips go faster. Damn, that felt too good to be real.Fred let his forehead rest against mine and closing his eyes harshly, as the pants left his mouth, his thrusts became rougher and messier. He hissed when I tightened around him and kissed him messy and clumsily.The over-sensitivity in my body as he kept going rough and the Burning Sucker kept working on me, made me quickly get to the peak of the rollercoaster, feeling the climax already invading me again.My legs trembled and I moved my hands from pulling hard Fred's hair to dig my nails in his back, closing my eyes harshly with my mind going dizzy and the goosebumps and quivers covering me."Oh, Lilith! " Fred whispered against my mouth and I let out a loud cry of pleasure. He gasped in his own hiss and a loud raspy and deep moan escaped his lips as he came inside of me hard.He closed his eyes harshly and tilted his head back as his body slightly trembled too over me and a little whine let his lips, with his orgasm covering him. He let out a long sigh and took off the Sucker from me, freeing my overstimulated clit and letting me breathe. He let himself fall over me, careful to not crash me under his body, and hid his face in the space between my neck and my collarbone, leaving soft and short kisses on my warm skin."Fuck, you felt so good..." he whispered, exhausted, hugging my waist and slightly caressing my back."You were amazing, Freddie," I murmured, out of breath too, while running my fingers through his hair."You are not mad at me, are you?" he genuinely asked, in a soft murmur, while raising his face to look at me. I couldn't help but caress his cheek as I admired his perfect face; his shining brown eyes, his beautiful features, his red lips and his soft skin..."I'm not, Freddie," I honestly replied, making his smile go wider. He left a single kiss on the tip of my nose and went back to rest his face in my neck.Fuck, I was entirely his.

The rest of July and August went by quicker than expected. All of us had a lot of work to do so we barely had energy or time enough for other things rather than having a couple of beers at my flat or at the twins'. Liv was starting to read more about Psychology, Pauline was also studying Politics since she wanted to get into the French Wizarding Ministry, and the twins were incredibly busy now that the shop was open - they even got orders from the Order - while I was mainly focused on the training, since the tryouts were in less than two weeks.Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes was even more crowded than usual and the students who were getting their things ready for the new course were fascinated by the products. From the distance, I immediately distinguished Fred in his suit, next to Harry and George."Boys!""Lilith, how have you been?" Harry hugged me, smiling, as soon as he saw me."Fine, mate, preparing the tryouts for the Harpies. What about you? You look great!"He blushed slightly, putting his hands in the pockets of his jeans. He had grown a couple of centimetres and his features had got sharper and more grown-up. "Just bored at my aunt's home. You know, the muggle ones."Fred got by my side and while I kept chatting with Harry, he tried to mess my hair and tickle me. I slapped his hand and glared at him, he simply shrugged amused. Once the Potter boy moved to the next section, still glazing at all the prank stuff and followed by George who was explaining everything to him, I looked back at Fred."What are you doing?""I want attention," he fakely pouted, putting his hands behind his back, as a child. I rolled my eyes."Of course you do," I simply said, giving him a soft punch in the arm. He grinned and walked to where Ginny and Hermione were; the WonderWitch section."Hello, ladies!" Fred and George said at the same time, getting beside the girls. Hermione raised her eyes and as soon as she saw me she went straight to hug me."Oh, I've missed you so much!""Aw, I know. I've missed you too lots, 'Mione." I kissed her cheek and observed her. Like Harry, she had grown a little bit during summer and looked more mature; she was incredibly stunning and more than one stare was on her. "Look at you! Didn't know you could get even better, Granger!"Hermione smiled and gave a discreet look at Fred, who had his eyes on us. Then her eyes went straight to follow Ron, who passed by our side high-fiving me. I stared at the girl with a little smirk and one of my eyebrows raised. Oh, Granger, what's going on with you?"These love filters are the strongest you're gonna find out there," I heard George speaking to Ginny."Even though we think you're doing good without them, sis," Fred turned around to tease Ginny, who quickly rolled her eyes and left the potion back in its place."That's none of your business," she said coldly. "Hi, Lilith!""Hello, love.""We heard you aren't dating Michael Corner anymore, instead, you are dating five guys at the same time," Fred continued, pretending to give his sister a severe look."Whatever Ron told you, it's a lie."I snickered, "Ginny you are my fucking idol, mate."The ginger girl winked at me while her brothers kept trying to worm the info out of her."Is it true that you are now dating Dean Thomas?""It's true," she simply said and started to look at some of the other stuff. "What are those? They're so cute!""Micropuffs. Mini Puffskeins." George replied."Yeah, they're great," Fred continued, "but don't you think you are switching boyfriends too fast?"I couldn't help but click my tongue. "Oh, c'mon, Fred. Let the girl enjoy."He snorted and was about to reply when a young blonde witch appeared by his side. Really pretty, a bit shorter than me, brown eyes, glossy lips and snow-white skin, she was wearing a magenta robe that told me she was one of the staff. So this was the girl who had started working at the shop and who Liv told me about. Fred looked immediately at her and I could almost swear he smiled at her. I couldn't help but feel all my instincts and senses vigilant."There's a client on the first floor looking for the prank cauldrons, Mr and Mr Weasley," she spoke with her soft tone. "And other ones asking for the of age section."Mr and Mr Weasley? That sounded weird - Hang on, OF AGE SECTION?Ginny looked at her brothers, surprised, with an amused smile while I noticed how Hermione blushed. "Wait, you two have an erotic section?!""Very well, Verity, I'm going," George said. So...Verity? Noted."Yes, but we're not selling you any stuff from there, Ginerva." Fred looked at his little sister, messing with her, amused, arching one of his eyebrows and raising a bit his chin. Fuck, he was looking good."It's Ginevra. No, actually it's Ginny, Frederick.""Whatever.""You do know she can get them anyway, right?" I smiled at the ginger boy devilishly and his sister nodded, proud."You two really love getting on my nerves, don't you?" he narrowed his eyes, glaring at Ginny and me. I high-fived the girl and she giggled."We do," we said at the same time and Fred simply snorted, going straight to the stairs to the first floor.From the big window, I saw a familiar blond hair and I felt my heart racing in my chest. I quickly waved at Ginny and basically ran downstairs and out of the shop."Draco!"The boy froze in his place and quickly turned around to face me. My heart fell to the ground when I observed him. He was looking good; taller than before, more muscular and more grown-up, his blond hair carefully brushed, a black suit, and his grey eyes. But he also looked drained of any energy, his face was empty of emotion while his eyes seemed to be in pain, and even though I noticed he had make-up on his face, I could guess the dark circles below it."Lilith-" his voice slightly trembled and I covered the distance that separated us to hug him tightly in between my arms, caressing his back. Oh, Merlin, I had missed him too much.He corresponded to my affection, but seemed a bit worried and kept looking everywhere around."How are you? How was your summer?" I asked him, trying to not point out the obvious decline he was having. He could fool the rest but not me."I- I can't talk to you here. Do you know where we can chat privately?"His words caught me by surprise but I nodded. "Yes, my flat is in this building, there's no one there at this hour."I quickly made him follow me and soon we were at my flat, out of anyone's curious sight."Take a seat, mate," I told him, getting my shoes off as I noticed he was doubting whether to sit on the couch or not. "You fancy a cup of tea?"He shook his head nervously and I scowled. Draco was a posh snob, meaning he NEVER rejected a cup of tea.Feeling a knot in my stomach, I put the kettle back in its place and sat next to him, glazing at him carefully and studying his expressions."What's wrong, Draco? What has happened during Summer?" I questioned slowly and with the softest tone I could find.He started playing with his rings and avoided looking directly at me."I saw them, Lilith."There was no question needed. By his tone, I knew who he was talking about. Death Eaters.Fuck my life.I swallowed hard, "Was she there? Did she or any of them hurt you?" I managed to keep my calm tone.His lower lip trembled slightly and I put a hand on his knee, trying to comfort him."Yes, Circe was there," my heart raced even more. "and He was as well. But they didn't hurt me... they-""Yes?""They asked me to do something. To prove my father's loyalty. If I don't do it," he swallowed hard, having his voice even weaker. "If I don't do it I might be in a big danger.""Oh, Draco..." I caught his hand in between mine and caressed it. "What kind of danger?""Your mother said... they might kill me to have revenge over my father for getting caught. As some kind of punishment. Bellatrix said I would make it, but if I don't-"He burst into tears and I felt my heart shrinking. I hugged him tightly caressing his hair and feeling his body shaking."Oh, my boy," he griped my shirt and hid his face in my shoulder. "What have they asked you to do? We can find a solution, love. You're not alone.""No," he quickly said, getting back into his place and trying to wipe the tears off. "No, no. I can't tell you, it's too dangerous. I can't do anything.""I'm older than you, you're almost like a brother to me. Trust me, we can do something against them.""No! I don't want to risk you. Mother is trying to do something about it but if she can't what makes you think you could?""I'm the one who is supposed to protect you!""I don't need protection! I've been chosen to do it, I have to face it.""Draco, you're almost a child, for Merlin's sake. You don't have to, you are free to choose. Let me help you."He shook his head again and I sighed in frustration."No, Lilith, you can't defeat them. They are strong and they are getting even stronger. Even if you managed to do something for me, they would come after us.""You can't give up this easily. Are you simply going to obey their orders and let them convert you into one of them?""That's what you don't understand. I should have tried to get out of it sooner, now it's too late. I'm already one of them," he let out, with his erratic breathing.I held my breath, without being able to avoid giving a quick gaze at his covered forearm. I wanted to shout at him, remind him the number of times I told him he didn't have to be like his dad, that he had the chance to get out of that world... But this wasn't the time for reproach."You are not. If you were, you would have already handed me to my mother."His eyes opened widely. "You know I'd never do that, you're my sister. Even if they think I don't have feelings, I actually do. I care about you.""I know, that's why I trust you and why I know you are not a Death Eater."Draco sighed again, running his fingers through his hair, messing it a little bit."Let me help you, Draco. Tell me what they have commanded you, we will tell the Order- No, we don't even need to. You and I can beat them alone. Let me be beside you."He tutted and snorted incredulous, as his eyes watered again. "I can't tell you, Lilith. Don't you understand? I can't tell you. And don't be such a fool, you know we can't do it. Not even in a million years. I doubt we could do it even with the Order's help."I tightened my lips. He was right. Not even I was believing my own words; the Death Eaters had a lot more of an advantage over us than what I wanted to admit.Then, something snapped in my mind."You can't tell me... You've made an unbreakable vow to not tell anyone what you were asked to do, haven't you?"He sobbed again, biting his lip, and nodded slowly."Oh, fuck," I ran my hands over my face, trying to clear my thoughts. "Ok, let me at least help you in some way. Please, Draco, you are only 16.""No. No, no no," he cleaned his tears again. "And I forbid you to mention anything about it or to try to solve it. I forbid you, Lilith."I noticed my throat clenching and the words could barely come out of my mouth. I felt like actually I couldn't say a word about Draco nor be able to help him in any way. Oh, this little fucker..."You have enchanted me?" I asked slowly."I don't want you to risk yourself. It's already dangerous enough for you to have me here," he nodded."Fuck, Draco. You say you don't want my protection but then you try to protect me at your own risk.""Deal with it."I clicked my tongue and dragged him back to me to hug him tightly."I just want you to be safe and out of that shit. I love you, Draco, you already know. I want to see you happy, living your life as the rich little brat you are, not being immersed in this. I can't lose you."I noticed how he slightly smiled. "You won't.""Promise me. Promise me that you will take care of yourself.""I promise you," he whispered, sounding more firm and convinced. His grip became stronger. "I love you lots, Lilith. I don't know what I'm going to do at Hogwarts without you.""You know I'm here for you whenever you need it. You are my family, Slytherin takes care of Slytherin."He separated from me, looking at me with his grey eyes a bit red as he interlaced his fingers with mine."Slytherin takes care of Slytherin," he repeated. "Thanks for being the sister I never had.""I could be better if you'd let me, you bloody wanker."He giggled, but his smile declined as he saw the clock on his wrist. His lips tightened."I have to go.""So soon?""Yeah, sorry, mother is waiting for me," he stood up, fixing his clothes and rubbing his eyes. I accompanied him to the door, not without hugging him again."Please, be careful, will you?"He nodded. "Take care, ok? And you better do your best at the Harpies tryouts."I smiled at him, "You already know I'll be the best Beater.""Wouldn't expect less from you."With a last smile, he went downstairs, leaving me alone and with an incredibly heavy heart.Oh, Draco, why you have to make things this hard?✵ ✵ ✵I put on my training clothes as my heart pounded hard. Today was the day. The tryouts.After another couple of days immersed in my own thoughts - especially thinking about Draco and feeling completely useless - I could only focus on Quidditch.Liv and Pauline both agreed to accompany me. Once they came back after Draco left they felt worried about me not being able to tell them and Liv even tried to erase the spell, but Draco's magic was actually so powerful she could barely make any difference and I couldn't break the enchantment by myself."You know you have this, you have worked incredibly hard," Liv cheered me, grabbing my hands. "As a Hufflepuff and your best friend, I feel incredibly proud of you.""Who's the best Beater in the world?" Pauline smirked at me."I am," I whispered, confident, trying to control my breathing."That's our girl.""I have to get the place. You two were already admitted at Uni, I really need to get my place as a Harpie.""You will get it," the two of them encouraged me.There were a bunch of girls already in the field and while my friends sat at the terraces, I joined the big group. They all looked well trained and some of them looked familiar to me since they probably had been Hogwarts students."Welcome to the Beater tryouts, ladies," a strong but also warm voice spoke. I raised my eyes and saw in front of us a gorgeous girl with the uniform, crossing her arms in front of her chest and a proud smile.She was incredibly beautiful; a couple of years older than me, her hair was covered with a green hijab that matched the tone of the uniform, her eyes were almost black, piercing and fierce and her brown skin shined under the morning sun giving her a powerful look. Oh, I knew who she was. I almost started panicking as soon as I saw her."My name is Khaleelah Zahir and I'm one of the Chasers and co-captain of the team along with Gwenog Jones, who unfortunately couldn't be here today. Instead, I'll be the one examining you, so good luck everyone."One of my favourite players besides Jones was going to examine me? The great Khaleelah Zahir! One of the biggest legends in the Harpies! Merlin's balls, I better nail it.I gave a quick gaze to where Pauline and Liv were sitting and they both lifted their thumbs up at me, I nodded at them and gave them a dim smile."We will start in alphabetical order and once all of you are done, I'll announce privately to the chosen girl my election," she continued with her authoritarian tone, without fading her little smile. "If I don't go to you exactly five minutes after the last girl has done the tryout, you can assume you haven't been chosen. This is how it works, we are not at the school team anymore. Again, good luck and do your best ladies!"Her eyes met mine for a brief moment and my breath got stuck in my lungs. Khaleelah Zahir looked at me! I can already die in peace.Because of my last name, I was one of the first ones to do the tryout. It consisted of a simple Quidditch game and I found myself incredibly comfortable with the team and how smooth everything was going. My training during summer got its reward because the contrary team barely scored twice versus the twenty times mine did. Once my feet touched the ground again, I looked at my friends, excited. They smiled widely, nodding and clapping hard. I was really happy with my result and I hoped it was enough for getting into the team. I would be terribly devastated if I didn't make it, not only because of the huge support I had received from my friends but also because of my personal pride.My eyes searched Khaleelah's to see any kind of reaction in her but she was keeping the same mysterious look and dim smile. I was nervous. Really nervous.While the other girls kept doing their tryouts, I went to the other part of the field where the terraces were and where Liv and Pauline quickly approached me."How was I?" I asked trying to catch my breath. The bloody sun was hitting hard.Liv handed me a bottle of water and Pauline gave me a little towel to dry my forehead sweat."You were fucking amazing, girl!""Yes, I don't think anyone can beat you. It was the smoothest and most powerful play I've seen in a long while." Liv added, smiling.I grinned at them and continued watching the rest of the girls, I could see clearly their mistakes or their strong spots. They were good, that was undeniable.Once the last girl was done, they all dispersed and went straight to see their friends who were supporting them as well as how Liv and Pauline were doing with me.I turned around to look at the two girls, feeling my breath going erratic because of how nervous I was. I knew I had been good, but did I give my best? Was it enough?"Calm down, Lilith," Liv whispered noticing how I was playing with my nails."You got this," Pauline smiled, with her eyes on the field.Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out."Lilith Arambella?" I heard a feminine voice behind me. My eyes opened widely and I turned around nervously.Khaleelah Zahir was in front of me, looking at the list in her hands."Y-yes," I coughed to clear my throat and to make my tone firmer. "That's me."As soon as I replied, her eyes raised and when she saw the expression on my face, she smiled gently."Congratulations, you are the new Beater," she simply said, offering me her hand which I quickly replied, shaking it. Even though I was in pure shock. "Welcome to the Holyhead Harpies."My smile couldn't be bigger and I heard how Liv and Pauline whooped behind me.FUCKING YES, I DID IT.

After going back at home - not without visiting Remus and Tonks to give them the news and watch their proud and excited smiles - I got straight into my room. Liv and Pauline decided to go out for dinner and even though they invited me, I declined. They needed time together.Taking off my training clothes, I put on the first shirt I found in my wardrobe and stayed in my underwear to then walk to the balcony. It was a warm afternoon even though September had already started. Putting a cigarette on my lips and lightening it, I saw someone opening the door from the balcony in front of me. Fred appeared with a cig hanging from his lips and his clothes from work, taking off the jacket. He looked tired and a bit unrested but also as if he had enjoyed the day."Alright?" he said giving me a little smile as soon as he saw me. "Godric! I'm knackered.""Tough day at work?" I said getting closer as he nodded."A bit. Lots of people, as usual, you know, and a lot of work. What've you been up to?"I shrugged, giving a short puff. "Had the tryouts today."His eyes opened widely and he seemed to pay more attention. "Fuck, yes, and how did it go?"A little cheeky idea popped into my head and I had to bite my inner cheek to hold back the smile on my face. I pretended to sigh hard and to play with my nails as if I was truly sad."Darling?" Fred asked again, trying to catch my eye contact."I didn't get in," I whispered, pretending to stutter and swallow hard. I heard Fred clicking his tongue."Shit."Before I could even notice, he had jumped the distance between our balconies and he was in front of me, grabbing my wrist to pull me closer to his body and hug me tightly. Still surprised at his speed and his reaction, I hugged him back."It doesn't matter, you can try again. You're good enough to be in any other of the greatest teams," he murmured as he caressed my hair. I glued more to his body. "Come 'ere, bear hug!"Fred caught me even tighter in between his arms and made me enter my room to them make us fall on my bed with his body over mine."Auch, Freddie, you're crushing me," I complained a little bit, smiling, feeling trapped under his body and every part of him against me."Shut up, let me cuddle you," he whispered hiding his face in the space between my neck and my collarbone."Fred!" I complained again, trying to move him uselessly. "Fred, you're crushing the new Beater of the Holyhead Harpies! Show more respect."He froze in his place and instantly raised his head to look at me with his eyes opened widely and the confusion shining in his face."Come again?"I couldn't hold it anymore so I burst into a chuckle, watching his reaction. His expression relaxed and he tried to bite his lip to hide the fact he was smiling."Oh, you little bitch," Fred muttered and before I could even react he started tickling me making me writhe under him, laughing even louder. Fuck, Frederick."F-Fred... Ah, Fre-d, s-stop..."I tried to talk in an out-of-breath voice laughing as his fingers aggressively covered my belly and my neck. "Shit- YOU WANKER!"He giggled over me. "That's for scaring me, Lilith. I'm the prankster here.""Fred!" I writhed still laughing but he continued, so I managed to lift my leg and hit his hip with my knee. Too close to a certain sensitive part of him. He immediately stopped, gasping."Shit, that was close," he snickered, looking at me with his eyes opened widely. I took all the air I could in my lungs being able to breathe again as Fred let himself fall next to me. We looked at each other and smiled. "When do you have your first match?""Khaleelah said it's next week.""You better keep one seat for me."His words alerted me."You want to go?"He snorted and looked at me with an amused and confused face as if I had asked the most obvious question in the world."Of course."The beat of my heart could be felt everywhere in my body. Fred wanted to come to my first match as a Harpie. He genuinely cared that much. I had to hold back from jumping of pure joy."What about the shop?""Bah, I bet George can manage by himself for a couple of hours. He can ask Bill for help now that he doesn't work every day because of his wedding stuff. I dunno.""True, your brother's marrying Fleur Delacour, right?"He nodded. Pauline had told me about it since Fleur asked her to be one of her bridesmaids."Well, then I guess I'll have you there as my personal cheerleader."He winked at me. "Go Harpies Go!"✵ ✵ ✵I was training in the field ready for the match when Khaleelah and the rest of the girls told me to approach them, I quickly did so. Since I was announced as the new member of the team, all of them had been incredibly nice and had included me in the group even before our match."You had played in other teams before, hadn't you, Lilith?" Khaleelah asked me curiously, examining me with a mysterious smile."Well, if you can consider the Slytherin Quidditch team so, then yes."She raised her eyebrows. "So Slytherin, huh?""Yeah, what about you? You went to Hogwarts, right?" I pretended not to know. Even if I did know. I didn't want to sound as if I was obsessed with the Harpies even if I actually was."Ravenclaw. After graduating, I spend a bit of time playing for the Magpies."I nodded, interested. Zahir had a lot of experience when she joined the Harpies three years ago. She was one of the quickest learners I've seen in the field and one of the most creatives when it came to techniques and team strategy.She was about to speak but her eyes focused on the terraces, she slightly scowled, amused."I think that ginger over there is waving at you."I followed her eyes and found an excited and smiley Fred sitting there, accompanied by Liv, Pauline and Remus. I couldn't help but grin widely as well, seeing their support."Yeah, he is a friend of mine,"She arched one of her eyebrows without erasing her smile as if she didn't completely believe me but nodded. "Go on, greet them. You have still twenty minutes left before the game starts."I didn't wait any longer to run to the terrace and since they were sitting in the second row without no one in front of them, we could talk freely."Freddie," I winked at him, greeting, and his smile grew."Hello, darling. Ready to be your personal cheerleader.""Remus! Didn't expect you here!"The man smiled at me, "Obviously I had to come, dear. Tonks would have wanted to come as well but she had to work at the Ministry."I felt Fred's eyes on me covering from up to down and licking his lips. The devilish part of my mind snickered, proud. Some of us players were wearing the Summer training clothes from the team before pulling on the uniform; it consisted of a dark green top with the logo of the Harpies in the front and a pair of shorts of the same colour."What've you been doing, girls?" I asked Pauline and Liv pretending to not notice the ginger's stare on me. I started tying up my hair to let my body more visible to him and I saw Liv looking at Fred, then at me, and arching one of her eyebrows smirking. She knew me too well."We've been hanging out with Fleur. She's a bit alone here in England," Pauline said innocently."Aw, poor girl. I can go with you three if she fancies it."While I waved at them ready to leave to the changing room, Fred managed to get in the first row and trap my hand in his to pull me closer, I already felt my body anxious at him;I managed to keep a straight face and not tremble. Freddie, don't play with me. "You look bloody good, Lilith," he whispered in my ear.I separated a bit off him and gave him a dim smirk as I winked again.After changing into the proper uniform and getting into the match, I found myself even more comfortable in the air with the girls than I ever felt playing with the Slytherin boys. There was unspoken complicity between us and it looked like we were reading each other's minds with every movement. The team we were playing against was one not as known and sadly for them but luckily for us, we beat them easily. Even though their seeker was probably their best player, Khaleelah and the other Chasers scored so many times that it became hard for the other team to even approach our Keeper. The public whooped when both Gwenog and I almost knocked off the brooms two of the other team's Chasers, not letting them score. I was so confident that I even made a little loop in the air hearing Fred and Remus whooping as Liv and Pauline clapped loudly as well as the rest of the crowd.By the time our seeker caught the Snitch, we had already a lot of advantage over the other team. The audience burst into shouts of pure joy and I landed on the ground high in adrenaline. The girls and I united in a huge team hug, celebrating our first win of the season."Good job, Arambella," Khaleelah congratulated me."Aye, Lilith! We are gonna fucking snap this league!" Aileen McDonald, the Seeker, cheered with joy and exultant."Thanks, girls! And bet, mate. This season is ours, you'll see." I waved at them and got into the changing room to put on my normal clothes, getting a quick shower first. Freshly recovered and still excited because of my first victory as a Harpie - a bloody Harpie! - I got out finding Remus, Liv, Lin, Fred and, surprisingly, George in front of me."That was absolutely incredible, Lilith!" Remus was the first one to speak, hugging me. "I'm so fucking proud of you. Shit."I giggled and high-fived both Olivia and Pauline as my eyes focused on one of the gingers."Georgie? I thought you were at the store."His smile went wider. "I was but we closed a bit early and I could make it to the end of the match. You didn't think I was going to miss your first match, did you?""That's my mate!" I jumped into his arms hearing him chuckling.Soon, my eyes focused on Fred, who was staring at me carefully. When my feet met the ground again he quickly grabbed me by my waist and pulled me closer to his body to hug me as well."I have to be honest, I got a bit hard watching you playing so well," he whispered in my ear."I've been playing like this all the time, it's just that you didn't notice when we played together," I whispered back."Oh, darling, believe me, I did notice.""You two know you can speak out loud, right? All of us here know about whatever you two are in," Liv spoke with her sweet tone, trying to hide her bitchy side. I snickered again and Fred stuck his tongue out at her."Liv is right, all of us here had to deal with your horniness at some point," George added, standing with the blonde."Remus didn't, you tosser." Fred clicked his tongue at his twin."Oh, sadly, I actually did," Remus spoke, nodding slightly. I looked at him a bit blushed but also amused, I still remembered the contraceptive spells he wrote me down."What?" Fred looked at me surprised and I shrugged."I'll tell you later.""Well, why don't we go for a couple of pints to celebrate Lilith's first victory?" Pauline suggested, interlacing her arm with Liv's."I'm up for it," George and I said at the same time."You two are always up for it." Olivia rolled her eyes."You love us, Oli. Don't try to hide it," the ginger smirked, full of arrogance."You young people can have all the fun," Remus sighed, putting his arm over my shoulder. "I'm a bit tired today so I might be going back home.""Remus, you sure? Are you okay?" I asked him, murmuring. I didn't want him to close in himself and not enjoy life."Yes, dear, don't worry about me. It's just the full moon, 's already close, you know."I nodded not completely convinced. "I'll go to your place tomorrow morning for a tea, fancy it?""'Course, love," he hugged me again and left a kiss on my forehead. "Love you lots.""Love you more."He gave us a last little smile before disappearing."Shall we go?"I was about to reply when a deep voice behind me interrupted us."Lilith Arambella? Is that you?"I quickly turned around noticing Fred getting a deep breath. I found a tall boy looking at me curiously. He had short messy black hair, brown skin with some moles in his neck, one of his eyes was dark brown, almost black, and the other one was of a sharp dark green. He was wearing the uniform of the Ballycastle Bats from Northern Ireland; red and black robes. I recognised him fully when I noticed the scar that covered his brown eye from the end of his eyebrow to nearly the bridge of his nose and his cheeky smile."Devyan?!" I smiled, incredulous.He nodded. "I saw you were included in the Harpies lineup and I knew it had to be you," his eyes moved to Fred and George behind me and became colder. "Weasleys.""Khan," they greeted him with the same dry tone.Devyan Khan was a muggle-born Slytherin student three years older than me, very popular among girls especially since he was never seen fully dating any of them. One of the best students in his year and the Gryffindor team's nightmare before Potter arrived and Devyan got gravely injured in one of his matches, having to stop playing. He was older so we never actually hang out but he used to be one of the coolest Slytherins I've ever met. He had such a reputation that even the pureblood supremacists respected him. I know, amazing."Lovegood! I almost didn't recognise you!" he smiled at Liv who grinned at him."Good to see you, Devyan. What've you been up to?""The boys and I play here tomorrow against the Magpies. We came to rest a bit before the match and learn the Harpies' new technique.""We have to go," Fred spat trying to sound deadpan with his eyes still on Khan. The Indian boy gave him a quick look and ignored him."It was nice to see you, Lilith. S'pose we will meet at the field and see each other soon," he winked at me."Sure, mate," I smiled and got to wave at him right before I noticed Fred's arm on mine to make us disappear.Once we got appeared again, we were at the twins' flat and I could feel Fred sliding his hand to my waist to make his grip discreetly more claiming and pulling me closer to him.Obviously, I didn't complain.

"Lilith, our training will be in an hour," Khaleelah announced to me while I was watching the start of the first match of the day. "I already know who will be our opponent.""Really? Who?""The Falmouth Falcons."I whistled surprised. "They're known for playing rough, aren't they?"Khaleelah smiled slightly. "Yes, I've got a bit of rivalry with their captain, he almost broke my leg last season. But the Ballycastle Bats are almost as hard as them and we're playing against the week after, so we better win the Falcons."I did remember reading in the Prophet about Khaleelah's lesion, fortunately for the team, they could heal her on time."Guess I'll have to get rough as well," I smirked while giving a quick gaze at the team all formed by boys who were watching the other match in their training clothes."All of us will, but don't worry, I have the perfect technique developed. I only need Gwenog to approve it and that game will be ours," she murmured, winking at me and walking next to Aileen McDonald who waved at us, smiley.My eyes went back to the game and the terraces and I almost melted when I saw him.Fred had his eyes on the match, looking really concentrated like a kid watching their favourite cartoons in the telly. I had to train with the whole team before next week's match and while I convinced Liv and Pauline to stay in bed because the training wasn't as important as the proper match when Fred heard me from his kitchen he insisted on coming with me. Apparently, the shop on Wednesdays wasn't as busy as the rest of the week.His ginger hair was moving a little bit because of the morning wind and he was playing with the rings in his fingers as his curious brown eyes moved following the players.Fuck, I loved him so much."Hello, Lilith," a deep voice spoke behind me. Before I could turn around, Devyan Khan walked slowly, getting by my side."Morning, Devyan," I gave him a kind smile. "Watching the match?"He nodded leaning his elbows on the rail that didn't allow the crowd to enter on the pitch. "We are playing against the Appleby Arrows next week. Need to observe and learn their techniques and way of playing.""To find their weakness and know how to beat them?" I narrowed my eyes, amused."Of course.""So Slytherin of you.""You leave Slytherin but Slytherin never leaves you.""Touché. Just waiting to know how you will study the Harpies.""Oh, dear," he snickered with an ironic sweet tone. "We have them deeply analysed. The only one who sneaks off our study is you, because of your newness, of course. Give us a week.""Good, now I know I have to tell Khaleelah to change the strategy once we're playing against you lot."Devyan's smile widened. "Probably. I still have a little faith in you to make the match funnier than usual.""Bet," I said taking off my pocket my pack of cigs and my lightener. I put a cigarette on my lips and offered the pack to the boy but he shook his head."I'm an athlete, mate. No alcohol or smoking."I rolled my eyes, lightening mine and putting back the pack. "Oh, yes, I remember. The pretentious boy whose only addiction is the poshest brand of tea in Britain."He snorted amused, "You know? When I saw you last time I thought you looked quite different from the last time we saw each other at Hogwarts but I'm glad to see that you keep being the same.""We barely talked at Hogwarts, Devyan! You were 'too old and too cool ' to hang out with me," I messed with him, watching how he clicked his tongue."Bah!" he shook his head without erasing the little smile. "But what surprised me the most was watching you stand next to Weasley without killing each other. Last time I checked, you two were declared enemies."I took a deep breath. Shit, that sound ages ago. My eyes focused on Fred in the distance for a moment, he was still concentrated on the match. He was so handsome it was almost painful."We were," I whispered, and then shook my head getting out of my own daydream. "But I suppose people change. Lots of things happened and we're on good terms now." I shrugged, watching how Devyan raised his eyebrows, smirking."Yeah, I could tell you two are on really good terms now," he drawled, like sweet poison, making me roll my eyes again and chuckle. "Who would have told? Little Arambella being friends with her Gryffindor biggest opponent...""I know - fuck, it sounds like if it was a long time ago, doesn't it? But don't act as if you two didn't have a rivalry as well, Khan. I still remember how you used to smash the whole Gryffindor team at the pitch."The arrogance brightened in his face."In case you've forgotten, I used to have a rivalry with the whole Gryffindor house. You can't imagine how glad I am of not playing against them while Potter was in the team. I can't even imagine myself losing against Wood.""Tell me about it! We barely won them any match.""Well, as far as I know, you had a really shitty team, mate. The best players in Slytherin during those years after me and the boys left were probably you, Pucey, and Montague every once in a while. Besides, the Potter boy has Quidditch in his blood and the Gryffindor team was already acceptable during my time."Couldn't argue that.The black-haired boy gave a quick look to the terraces and clenched his jaw, making his smirk wilder and devilish. He looked like a snake plotting an evil plan."Your ginger is looking at us," Devyan whispered amused, coming closer and looking back at me. I felt my eyes slightly opening more and my eyebrows raising. "Shall we give him a bit of fun?""You only want to mess with him," I gave the boy in front of me an arrogant smile that he imitated."Clearly," he murmured as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "That's exactly what fun means, Lilith."I finished my cig and stepped on the fag-end."He seems quite pissed off, you see. Actually jealous."I felt the butterflies in my stomach as I chuckled. Was it true? Was Fred jealous?"Bah, don't mess with me, Khan.""Look at it yourself!" the boy giggled, pointing discreetly with his head to where the ginger was, without putting his gaze off me.I obeyed Devyan and found Fred's piercing eyes on us two. He didn't seem concentrated anymore, at least not in the match, he was looking fierce and, even in the distance, I saw him breathing slowly and deeply. He was trying to keep playing with his rings as if he didn't care but the slight frown of his eyebrows and the sharpness in his stare said otherwise.Devyan giggled by my side."Should have known you two would take the 'getting along' part too far."I clicked my tongue smiling, but before I could reply to him, a boy from his team whistled in the distance, calling his attention."Well, s'pose we will have to leave our entertaining chat for another day." Devyan smiled at me, slightly arching one of his eyebrows. "It was nice to use you to bother Weasley, Lilith.""Go off, Khan!" I snickered, shaking my head. He turned around, grinning, and went to the encounter of his team, putting an arm around the boy who called him's shoulders.My eyes went straight back to Fred, who followed Devyan's path glaring at him and then going back to me. Once our looks met, he raised a little bit his chin in an arrogant way reminding me of our dark past but softening a bit the bonfire in his eyes. I swallowed hard but didn't flinch."Lilith! Time to train!" Khaleelah called me from already inside of the pitch. I didn't even notice the match had finished.During the whole time the training lasted, I felt Fred's eyes piercing me and following every little movement I did but with a deadpan expression on his face. An hour later, we were done."Fine, girls. We'll see each other two days previous to the match, a' right?" Khaleelah spoke while picking up her towel from the grass and making sure her hijab was as perfect as usual. "Remember to give a little glimpse of the game strategy we will use against the Falcons."We all nodded at the same time."Great, cheers, girls.""Cheers!" I waved at them while walking to the terraces to meet Fred.When I got in front of him, slightly unsure, he immediately stood up and started to walk to leave the field."Freddie?" I called him, trying to follow the velocity of his steps."Huh?""You good?""Perfectly fine," he replied a bit too dry and fast to be true."Don't lie to my face, Weasley," I spoke with a soft tone but firmly, catching his hand and making him turn around to face me. His cold stare relaxed a bit and he let out a long sigh."Didn't know you were so close to Khan," he tried to sound amused, reminding me way too much to when he used to mess with me with the same coldness in his tone and daggers in his eyes.No, love, don't look at me like that, please."We were just talking.""A bit too close, don't you think?""He was the one who approached me.""Yeah, I could tell, Lilith."I furrowed my eyebrows."Don't talk to me like that, watch your tone," I spat, very serious and he seemed to calm down. "Last time I checked, I can chat with whoever the fuck I want. It's not my fault nor his that you are jealous.""I'm not jealous," he quickly replied, shrugging. "I just don't like Khan.""Well, I do. He hasn't done anything to me, and you can call him Devyan. That stupid rivalry at Hogwarts was ages ago."Fred snorted, "Yes, I bet you like him a lot," he sarcastically said, "He's a prick.""At least he doesn't behave like a fucking wanker!" I burst, exhausted of his attitude. "Your friend Sienna was way worse with me and I've never told you anything about her, have I?""It's not the same," he rolled his eyes."Aha, whatever," I muttered, starting to walk away from him. I can love him so much that my heart feels like exploding but no one speaks to me like that, not even Fred."Lilith, wait," Fred murmured with a softer tone while trying to grab my hand but I slapped his. "Darling-""Fuck off," I took my wand and made myself disappear in front of his puppy eyes, feeling the rage covering me.✵ ✵ ✵I felt terrible the next day. I couldn't help but overthink Fred's words. He probably didn't love me but if there was once thing ai could have sworn, it was that he was jealous. And watching it from his perspective, I could understand why he was so pissed off about Devyan. When I saw the ginger from my window, I only wanted to jump into his flat and fill his cheeks with kisses, tell him I'm sorry and hearing him apologising as well. I just wanted to make peace with him because if I knew something, it definitely was that I didn't want to lose Fred. I couldn't lose Fred.During the morning, Liv and Pauline joined together to help me prepare some biscuits and crumpets to take to Fred's office as a ceasefire offer. I made them strawberry, cinnamon and honey flavoured, his favourites."Damn, Lilith, if that tool doesn't, at least, eat you out after trying these sweets then you should consider your love for him," Liv murmured, enjoying the crumpet I gave her to try."Zut! This is pure good!" Pauline licked her lips after trying the biscuits."I'm gonna take them to him now, maybe he stops having that long face once and for all," I picked the platter and blew a kiss to the girls. "Cheers for helping me, dears."Going down of my flat to get to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes carrying the full platter felt like an almost impossible task but I managed to get inside the shop without dropping any of the sweets."Oi, Georgie!" I called the ginger boy when I saw him at the counter. He immediately smiled at me."Morning, mate. Are those for me?" he smirked."You can have some if you want, but I'm actually looking for the fool of your brother. Need to apologise to him.""Oh, Godric, yes, please! He's been with a long face since yesterday! He didn't want to tell me what happened but knowing my brother as I do, bet it has something to do with your new friend Khan."I opened my eyes widely, leaving some of the crumpets and biscuits on the table for George to enjoy them."How did you know?""Again, I know my twin.""Devyan is just an acquaintance. I don't even consider him my friend.""I know, Lilith, you don't have to excuse yourself with me. I know what kind of nitwit I have for a twin. Just give him those sweets and watch him calm down.""Sure," I smiled at George. "Where's he?""At his office. Second floor, right, first door.""Thanks, mate."I followed Georgie's instructions and soon I was in front of a dark red door. I knocked twice hearing the 'come in' from inside. Carefully, I opened the door, giving a quick look to see Fred's reaction.He was sitting behind his desk full of papers and only raised his eyes when he noticed I didn't say a word. His expression didn't change but his eyebrows frowned, curiously."Good to see you," he simply said, leaning back on his seat."You've avoided me.""Didn't want to piss you off more than I already did."I sighed heavily, showing him the pastries. "I've come to bring you a truce offer."His serious expression fell and a little tender smile covered his face as his stare relaxed."You didn't need to, darling. Actually, I was planning to look for you later night to apologise to you and have a cig together."The tingles covered my body and I couldn't help but smile as well as I left the platter on his desk, careful not to ruin any of his papers."What are you doing?" I asked curiously.He picked one of the crumpets and ate it almost in one single bite. He licked his lips, making me observe every single one of his movements. "Shit, Lilith, this is so bloody good," he wiped the corners of his lips slightly with the tips of his fingers. "I'm doing some of the accounting of the shop."I snorted, "And you used to say you are not a smart-arse."He snickered but when he was about to reply another knock was heard. "Come in!"Verity entered carefully and gave us a surprised look, I had to restrain myself from arching my eyebrow."Good morning," she greeted softly at me."Morning," I said as polite as possible."Mr Weasley, an owl arrived for you.""Who is it from?" Fred asked genuinely curious and I couldn't help but pay even more attention.Verity looked for her glasses in the pocket of her robe, a bit clumsily. "Uhm... it says here it's from 'Ms. Plums."Fucking shit, this is the last straw.I crossed my arms in front of my chest looking at Fred, his eyes met mine for a brief moment and I could swear I saw a mischievous and amused smile on his face. Verity handed him the letter and discreetly left while I felt her scared look on my back. However, I couldn't care less.The ginger opened the letter and started reading it with that silly smile on his face. I felt my guts burning and every single nerve on my body screaming in pure rage as the perfume of that Sienna bitch filled the air.I wanted to rip that letter from his hands and throw it to Plums's face, I wanted to erase that smile from his face with my kisses, I wanted to mark him as mine.He was mine.

No, he wasn't. That was why it not only angered me but hurt me.I barely noticed when my breathing started to become deeper and when my blood began to boil in my veins."I'm still here, are you gonna look at me or do you prefer to keep reading that bitch's letter and filling the air with her nauseating smell?" I spoke with the coldest and most deadpan tone I could find.Fred giggled and looked at me with that mischief shining in his eyes."It smells nice.""Yeah, and Liv is straight."He shook his head and stood up from his chair. With our looks still connected, he walked closer to me and leaned against his desk. Before I could notice, one of his hands surrounded my waist attracting me to him and glueing our bodies.The only feel of him so near to me and his brown eyes going from mine to my lips sent quivers all over my body and made the fire of rage in my veins transform into another kind of fire.Don't tempt me, Freddie."Are you jealous, darling?"Fuck yes."No," I drawled, keeping eye contact with him.He snickered and I felt myself slightly trembling in between his arms."Really? It looks like," he rasped, grazing his lips with mine. I craved him silently, managing to stay firm."Don't play with me, Fred.""Or what, Lilith? What are you gonna do?"The devilish part of my mind took control over me and I trapped his lips between mine in a slow, sinful and tempting kiss, like good poison, letting him feel me as much as he could over the clothes. I bit softly his lower lip as I separated from him, hearing a little pant escaping from his mouth.I walked back to the door, still looking at him."You'll see, Freddie. You played the wrong card."

The next morning when I woke up, I was decided to play with Fred and make him regret challenging me. Since today was my free day, I offered George my help at the shop with the intention of messing with Fred during the whole day.When I saw him in his room through my window, my devilish part whooped as I walked to the balcony, sitting on the edge and crossing my legs. Time to start my plan. He quickly noticed me and approached me while putting on his shirt."Good morning, darling. Are you still angry?" he teased me, leaning against the door's frame.I didn't reply, instead, I looked to my own legs making him follow the path with his eyes. Immediately, I heard his heavy breathing."Is that-""Your favourite skirt? The one I used when you fucked me at my Slytherin dorm?" I interrupted him, faking the innocence in my tone. "Yes.""George told me you are helping us at the store today, are you trying to make my day a bit happier?"I snickered in a raspy voice. Oh, dear..."On the contrary, darling. I'm gonna make you suffer the whole day," I played with a piece of my hair and rubbed my thighs tightly. "I'm not wearing underwear," I made a pause, watching his reaction, his chest filled with air as his jawline clenched, " and you will have to see me strolling along your shop knowing you are the only one who knows there's nothing below this skirt.""You wouldn't dare," Fred chuckled, trying to sound confident, while the depth in his voice proved how turned on he already was.A little smirk formed on my lips, my blood felt like fire in the most delicious way as I saw the big effect I had on him. My Freddie."Try me, Freddie," I murmured, while slowly opening my legs to prove my words. His eyes immediately went down there, getting darker and shining more, as he licked his lips and took a deep and long breath."Fuck, Lilith-" he let out, a bit out of breath."However," I continued, running my hand from my knee to hip in a slow path. "you are not going to touch me, darling."I closed my legs in the blink of an eye, making him swallow hard and putting his eyes back on mine. I kept that dim smile only to annoy him."Lilith..." Fred spoke in a desperate whisper, slightly shaking his head."I told you you played the wrong card. Now face the consequences," giving him a cynic wink, I got out of the balcony, making sure to swing my hips as I walked out, feeling Fred's stare piercing me.Plan started."Are you going to the shop?" Liv asked me once I walked to the kitchen. She sat on the counter to drink her morning tea."Yeah, where's Lin?""She went out to buy breakfast. Can you tell George we are meeting at 6 in the evening?""Sure, where are you going?""Lin and I are going on a double date with him and Angie. We thought about inviting you and Fred but after how he behaved with you I'm not pretty sure if you'd like it," she rolled her eyes.I snorted, amused. "Yeah, no, thanks. I'm good staying here.""You can invite him and stay alone," she raised her eyebrows and winked at me."If he loses that fucking attitude, perhaps."✵ ✵ ✵After telling George, I went straight to work, helping the clients to find the articles they were looking for. Since it was a busy morning, both George and Fred also had to be out of their offices so every once in a while I could feel Fred's eyes on me.He was trying by any means to be close to me and made sure I was noticing it; on one of the occasions, while I was talking to one of the clients, he passed by my side, grazing his hand with mine, distracting me. In other, he almost bumped into me, staying for too long staring at my lips. The funniest ones definitely were when two times some clients tried to shamelessly flirt with me while I was explaining to them how some of the gadgets worked. I declined their offers and tried to respond as polite as possible but, apparently, it wasn't enough since as soon as Fred saw it, he got only a couple of steps away from us and leaned against the huge shelves, with his arms crossed in front of his chest and looking daggers - first at the boy and in the second time, at the girl - until they left, visibly uncomfortable.On other occasions, I was the one provoking him and looking for him to make sure he didn't forget about me; in one of the crowdest corridors, I made sure to walk in front of him making my bum almost touch him, noticing how I left him behind breathing deeply again.Liv brought me some lunch and I ate it chatting with George, who seemed to notice that something was going on between Fred and me but not fully understanding exactly what. His twin, however, tried to avoid me, especially after I sucked slowly the tips of my fingers looking at him straight in the eye after eating some strawberries.By half-past five in the evening, George was preparing to leave and Fred was resting a little bit, leaning against the counter since the shop wasn't half as crowd as during the morning. I couldn't take my eyes off him and his lost look while he distractedly ran his index finger by his lower lip, showing me the rings in his hand."Oh, sorry!" a girl apologised after she dropped one of the boxes of Patented Daydream Charms in front of me."Don't worry, I'll pick it up," I turned a bit around making sure Fred was looking at me and then, I quickly bent down to pick it from the floor, grabbing the end of my skirt to make sure I wasn't showing my lack of underwear."Thanks," the girl smiled at me when I returned the box to her and she walked away to the counter where now Verity was.I saw Fred almost running upstairs to his office, running his fingers through his hair. Where are you going so soon, love?"Verity, you need my help with anything else?" I asked the girl as I passed next to her on my way upstairs. She shook her head and gave me a kind smile."No Ms, thanks so much for your help, though."I felt a bit bad about how I treated her and how I thought about her the previous days... till the moment, she hadn't been any kind of threat. I slightly smiled back."No problem. And you can call me Lilith."I went upstairs straight to Fred's office and opened the door without knocking, closing it behind me. He was sitting in his chair, with his head tilted back and his eyes closed, trying to get fresh air. Even from the distance, I could see his hand over his trousers, not completely touching himself but definitely trying to calm down.He opened his eyes, full of desire and hunger, and snorted once he saw me."Of course, it had to be you."I arched one of my eyebrows, smiling, putting my hands behind my back, noticing how he swallowed hard when my shirt tightened"Oh, now you don't like to see me?""I think we both can see I do like to see you. A bit too much," he cynically pointed at the clear hardness in his trousers, looking exasperated and frustrated."I did nothing for you to be like that," I smiled, innocently. He glared at me and giggled shaking his head as if he couldn't believe my words."No, you never do anything," Fred spat, sarcastically, and I raised my chin arrogantly. "Merlin, Lilith," he murmured, muffled, breathing heavily as his eyes went down on me to then go back to mine. "The things I'd do to you right now..."I bit my lip at the image of Fred fucking me rough against his desk but I had to stay firm so I simply snickered in the most seductive voice I could while approaching his desk and putting my hands over it to lean forward him."What's going on, Freddie? Do you want to touch me?""I'm craving it, Lilith," he confessed, burning me with his wild and fierce eyes.I clicked my tongue, "What a pity for you, darling..."He let out a desperate sigh and ran his hands through his face."Haven't you punished me enough?""Not even close," an amused snort let my lips."Then why are you here? To make sure you are leaving too hard to even think of something else that isn't you?"I felt the fire in my veins concentrating below my skirt and every nerve in my body craving him and his touch. Stay strong, Lilith."Yes, but not only for that," I moved to the credenza beside his desk where he had a kettle, some tea bags, sugar and a bottle of milk. "I wanted a cuppa.""George has tea in his office too," Fred quickly said, still staring at me."I know, but I wanted yours."Fred sighed again, letting out an incredulous chuckle."You are incredible.""I know that too," I turned around with my tea ready, leaned against the furniture, I gave a long sip to the steamy drink, keeping eye contact with him and licking my lips. He tilted his head back again, doing a little frustrated complaining noise that made my smile wide even more.A knock was heard from outside the door and Fred shouted a 'come in' without putting his eyes away from me."Mr Weasley, Sienna Plums is here to see y-" before Verity could speak, Sienna pushed her, not so discreetly, entering the office. She was looking good, her hair tied up and wearing a summer light green dress that suited her olive skin. If there was something I could not deny about her was that she was a very good-looking girl, but I would die before admitting out loud something good about that bitch.She was smiling at Fred but as soon as her eyes focused on me, the happiness in them erased and she crossed her arms in front of her chest, getting in a quite arrogant pose while arching one of her eyebrows."What are you doing here?" she spat, looking at me from up to down with a disgusted look. I chuckled and gave another sip of my tea."I'm going back down," Verity whispered, visibly uncomfortable."Thanks, Verity. And apologies on behalf of Plums for almost slamming you against the door's frame," I said while keeping my eyes on the brunette.The blonde girl tightened her lips, blushing a little bit, and closed the door behind us."What are you doing here, Arambella?" Sienna repeated her question."Isn't it obvious or are you too dense to understand?" I showed her the magenta shirt with the shop's logo. "I'm helping the twins.""Bah! You are just probably showing off now that you are a Harpie. Luckily for me, the Falcons will put you back down to fucking Earth."I snorted leaving the cup of tea away and crossing my arms in front of my chest."Don't get on my face, Plums. Don't make me repeat what Liv did to you."She scowled and looked at Fred with puppy eyes."Fred, now you know why I don't like her, she hasn't changed! Aren't you gonna say anything to her?"The ginger looked at her confused."What I don't know is what are you doing here."That's my boy.I didn't bother to hold back my chuckle when I saw Plums's fake sad face fading away and looking at Fred completely astonished."I didn't receive a response from the letter I sent you, so I wanted to personally make sure you received it and read it."The old anger reappeared in my guts as I glared at her. I hate her. I hate her so much."I did get it, yes. But if Verity hadn't handed it to me, I wouldn't even have known it was yours. To be honest, mate, I didn't read further that 'Dear, Freddie:', I told you only George calls me that."Ding, ding, ding! Another point for Lilith. The devilish part of me roared internally in pure joy.I arched one of my eyebrows as the rage soothed at his words and a dim smile appeared on my face again."Well, that's really rude of you," Sienna complained.Fred shrugged, "It is what it is, now, if you don't mind I have to get back to work so..." he looked at the door, letting her know he wanted her out of there."Bye, Plums," I smirked at her full of arrogance.Take that, you bitch."Shut up, Arambella," she walked angrily at the door, and before slamming it behind her she spat at me, with pure rage, "I hope the slut of your mother finds you soon."I blew a kiss at her and heard her snorting.Still amused at the situation, I put my eyes back on Fred who was again looking at me, deadpan."Well done, Freddie," I purred, approaching him. He separated a bit from the desk to give me space to be closer to him but, much to his dismay, I still didn't touch him."I was being honest, I didn't read her letter. Just wanted to see your jealousy after provoking me with Khan. A little taste of your own medicine."Smiling and completely turned on, I caught his face in between my hand and pulled him closer to me, grazing my nose with his. "Such a good boy for me."His deadpan expression broke into a wild smirk that sent quivers all over my body. "Do I get to fuck you finally? I swear to Merlin I don't even know how I'm holding myself back from putting you on my lap and doing it right now..."I gave him a feline smile and grabbed his tie to make him stand up, getting even closer to me. I stared into his brown - almost black of wild desire - eyes, with the craving shining in them and grazed my lips against his as I whispered;"Oh, no, Freddie..." I tutted while noticing his breath becoming a bit erratic. "I'm fucking you."

"Take off your shirt."While I was lightening some of the candles in my room, Fred sat in the chair I had in front of my bed, sighing and looking at me from up to down."What are you gonna do with me, darling?" he drawled, amused, and with the craving and arousal shining in his brown eyes as a slow and intense fire. I gave him a little arrogant smile as I approached him, making our knees almost touch and admiring the fierceness in his stare."I'm going to teach you to not play with me, Freddie," I extended my hand to his cheek and ran my index finger over his jawline, scratching a little bit his skin with my long nail. Pleasing my own hunger, I straddled his lap watching how he tilted his head back at having me finally so close to him. He tried to touch me but I slapped his hands."Don't touch me."He giggled. "Oh, you are going to make me suffer more, got it."I didn't reply, simply opened one of the drawers of my wardrobe next to us and took out my Slytherin tie. I showered it to him with pride while sliding it by my hands. Fred took a deep breath and a little smile started to form at the corners of his lips."Damn, I'm fucked up, aren't I?""So fucked up, darling," I whispered pretty close to his lips. "But before I put my precious tie around your hands and wrists, we have something to discuss."He frowned his eyebrows, kinda confused. "What is it?""A safe word.""What?""A safeword, Fred. I'm gonna have fun with you and I don't want to hurt you - not too much, at least. But it can also work for when you dominate me.""Fine," he started thinking, his eyes shined again when he found the word. "I've got it. Blueberry."I nodded. I only hoped we wouldn't be using it."Now, show me your hands," I ordered him and he obeyed, snorting. His attitude was like if he was actually dominating but he was letting me think I was the one doing it.I made a good knot with the Slytherin tie making sure it immobilised his hands and wrists, making it impossible for him to get rid of it. I stood up from his lap and walked backwards - observing him and how much at my mercy he was - to sit on my bed in front of him."I never thought Slytherin could look so good on you," I murmured. And I was being honest, the dark green against his pale skin and the contrast with his bright ginger hair resulted really attractive. "You know why I'm so fucking mad at you, don't you, Freddie?"He snickered with a deep voice."For making you jealous. For teasing you. For behaving like a dickhead with you.""Aha, that's right. And do you know how I'm going to have my revenge?" I rubbed my thighs together and spoke in the smoothest and silkiest tone I could, like sweet poison coming out of my mouth. "I'm going to tease you, Freddie. I'm going to make you beg to touch me."His eyes opened widely and his lips separated to take a deep breath. I stood up from my bed and patiently, pulled down my clothes, staying completely naked in front of him.Fred's look covered me from up to down, licking his lips and moving in his seat. "How can you be so bloody beautiful?""Silence, Freddie," I sat back again, running my hands from my knees to my hips, provoking him even more. He let out a broken sigh as I felt the temperature in the room increased. "Do you remember after you fucked me in my Slytherin dorm when you said it would be a spectacle to watch me touching myself thinking about you?"Fred held his breath and his eyes looked at me perplexed, realising about my intentions."Lilith-" his voice sounded begging and raspy."Now you are going to enjoy that," I continued, ignoring the sexual frustration in his eyes.I laid back in my bed, spreading my legs to let him fully see the wetness growing in between them, his breathing became deeper and faster as I put one of my hands in my breast and the other one caressing my hips.A muffled moan left my lips, making me close my eyes when my fingers met my throbbing clit and the heat coming from me. I heard Fred letting out a little and soft growl in an almost imperceptible low voice as his eyes were fixed on where my fingers were doing circles. I made two of them enter inside of me after teasing me on my own and feeling the tightness and wetness around them."Freddie," I let out in a soft moan, imagining my fingers being his and having every single nerve on my body craving him in every way possible."Oh, you are going to kill me," he burst out, tilting his head back and letting me see how his trousers showed how hard he was. "You are such a beautiful slut... touching what is mine only to provoke me.""Do you wish you were touching me right now?" I panted while feeling my fingers coming in and out of me and the currents of pleasure slowly invading my sensitive body."I wish I was deep buried inside of you, Lilith," he confessed, with his stare glued at me. I moved my hand once again and gasped when I felt myself grazing my climax. Fred made a little noise complaining as he moved in the chair, uncomfortable. "Darling, please..."Fuck, I needed him.With my body begging to be relieved, I stood up, got closer to Fred and grabbed the tie to drag him with me. I pushed him to make him fall over my bed and then, climbed on top of him, making sure no part of my body was touching his while I tied his hands to the headboard."Are you going to be a good boy for me, Freddie?" I murmured against his lips and Fred clenched his jaw."Yes," he whispered, desperate.I smiled while unbuttoning his trousers and pulling them down along with his boxers, leaving free his erection. His tip was redder than usual and the veins throbbed demanding attention. "Does it hurt, darling?" I teased him, caressing his thigh."Yes, it fucking does," Fred slightly whined, "Fuck, Lilith, I need you."Full of ego, I straddle his abdomen, watching his eyes covering me in a craving way that made me melt and the fire in my guts burn eagerly. I put my finger back in my clit and started doing really slow circles as Fred's stare focused there and a muffled moan left his lips."You can't even imagine the number of times I have touched myself thinking about you, Freddie. The last time was a few days ago in this same bed, wishing my fingers were yours and wanting to hear your hips crashing against mine, pleasing me like only you know how to."Another current of pleasure covered me from the tip of my toes to my head as the slow movement of my finger and the corporal heat coming from Fred under me aroused me even more."Darling, p-please," the ginger whispered, licking his lips."Please, what?""Fuck me,"I caught his face in my hand and lowered myself to whisper against his dry lips;"I'm going to fuck you, rough, and if you take it like a good boy and promise me you don't cum until I say you can, then I won't have you begging for too long to touch me, deal?"He tried to move his hands from the grip and clicked his tongue when he realised there was no way to get rid of it unless I was the one untieing him. Fred sighed and closed his eyes for a brief moment."Deal, but please, Lilith -" he swallowed hard, "fuck me already."Giving him a little smirk, I grabbed his throbbing dick, watching the tip being redder and full of pre-cum and after giving it a dim caress, hearing a soft moan leaving his lips, I guided it to my entrance.He moved under me, impatiently, trying to push himself inside but I placed a hand in his chest, stopping him and reminding him who was in control. I made him go inside of me painfully slowly, lowering my hips. Fred let out a deep and raspy moan, closing his eyes, the moment he felt me trapping him and I gasped once I had him entirely inside of me."Do I feel good, Freddie?" I rolled my hips hearing him panting and breathing erratically."S-so good, darling, f-fuck," he whimpered, clenching his closed eyes and struggling to normalize his breathing. I felt my whole body burning at him and his dick pulsating inside of me. I was so fucking tied up to him.I lifted my hips to start making him go in and out of me, increasing my velocity, making it a bit rougher. Fred tried to bite his lips to drown his moans but I ran my thumb by his lower lip making him free it."Moan for me, Freddie-" I interrupted myself with my own whine. "Let me hear how weak I make you."He hissed and I rocked my hips, riding him roughly, crashing my skin against his in a bewitching sound, feeling his size filling me and digging my nails from his chest to almost his hips."Lilith-" he murmured with his voice out-of-breathe and piercing me with his desperate eyes. "K-kiss me. Kiss me, darling, please."I put one of my hands against his neck and pressed slightly, hearing Fred gasp. The only sight of him sweaty and bare, whimpering for how well I was pleasing him, darker eyes and open mouth, made me weak so I clenched around him, hearing our raspy moans mixing together.I lowered myself to graze my lips with his as the movements of my hips became briefly slower, keeping him going as deep inside of me as possible."Is that what I think I'm hearing, Freddie? Are you begging me to kiss you?" I rolled my hips once again and he panted, swallowing hard and with his eyes fixed on my lips."Yes, yes, please."I gave him a proud smirk and then slammed my lips against his, feeling his flavour and his heat overwhelming me, the smooth touch of his mouth and his tongue sinfully playing with mine in a messy and devouring kiss. I bit his lip softly and then moved mine to his jawline, pulling his hair to force him to expose the sensitive skin of his neck to me. I kissed, sucked and carefully bit, hearing his groans in approval and marking him as mine.Completely mine.I put my two hands at the end of his neck and looking at Fred straight in the eye, I raised myself and started riding him even rougher than before, feeling his tip aggressively hitting my weakest spot and making me whimper.His dick came in and out of me, stretching me at his size and being trapped by my walls and wetness, I could spend the rest of my life like this. A loud raspy whine scratched my throat followed by another moan when I rolled my hips again and the sensitivity and overstimulation were driving me crazy, making me see fireworks and stars at the back of my eyes."Fuck, Fred!"He whimpered again and bit his lip even harder, breathing erratic and intermittent."Li-lith, I'm going to cum. Let me touch you, please. I'm- " Fred swallowed hard again and tilted his head back, trying again uselessly to move his hands. "I'm gonna lose my mind if I don't touch you.""You better don't dare to cum, Freddie..." I whispered, out of breath, and with my mind dizzy because of all the pleasure. "If you do, you are not fucking me again in a long time, do you hear me?"He nodded, frustrated and clenching his jaw as another moan left his lips. "Fine! But let me touch you, p-please!"Craving as well his hands over me, I lowered myself starting to untie him, making sure my hips kept moving with him inside. Fred took advantage of the position to trap my nipple in his mouth and suck it harshly, making me tremble and pant as the shivers ran down straight to my clit.Once his hands were free, impatiently, he threw away the tie and passed his hands around my back to glue me back to his body. He caressed my skin hungry to cover it all and smacked my bum to then grab it and start pounding inside of me with the same roughness I was riding him. Fred's lips covered my neck and my breast aggressively, making me weak as I felt his dick hitting my weakest spot even more harshly.Fred moaned against my lips, desperate when I clenched around him, and the sudden feeling of his eager touch all over my body was enough to quickly drive me to the climb of my climax."That's it, Freddie, make me cum like the good boy you are," I murmured against his lips. Fred snarled and dug his hands in my hips as he opened his mouth, sticking out his tongue. I knew exactly what he wanted. Feeling my pussy pulsating and throbbing as my orgasm was forming in my entrails, burning me in the most delicious and sinful way possible, I spat in Fred's mouth. He swallowed proudly and made me kiss him messily as I tightened around him, feeling the strongest current of pleasure invading me and the orgasm covering me from up to down. My mind went a bit dizzy and every nerve in my body exploded in pure pleasure."Freddie..."I moaned against his lips as his thrusts continued as rough as before. I took again the control, still over-sensitive and overstimulated, and looked full of myself at him being turned into such a mess only for and by me. "Look at you, darling. So ruined for me..."I rolled my hips a bit more aggressively and Fred's hands dug even more in them as a loud whimper left his mouth and he tilted his head back, closing his eyes. His legs started trembling because of the unrelieved tension and he looked even more frustrated and desperate than before. Once again, I clenched myself around him."Lilith, please!" Fred begged, desperate. "Let m-me cum, please!"I scratched his chest with my nails, making him even more sensitive. Feeling him throbbing even more inside of me and his muffled moans and whines, I put my hand against his neck again;"Cum for me, Freddie."His eyes shined in fire and arousal and then closed when a loud gasp, interrupted by his own raspy and deep moan, left his lips, coming inside of me and releasing himself in a hard orgasm. His legs kept trembling as he tilted his head back, rolling his eyes. His jawline became sharper and the veins in his arms and neck beat because of the relief. He got goosebumps all over his body and every inch of his skin was running high. A muffled soft moan left his lips as he filled me, with a little tear, because of the huge amount of pleasure, leaving his eye and coming down his cheek."F-fuuuck," his voice trembled in a soft whisper as he tried to recover. With him still inside of me, and both trying to catch air after such a spread of pleasure, I grazed my lips against his, and a wide smile appeared on his face while his eyes pierced mine. "That was the best orgasm I ever had."I snickered and left a short kiss on his lips. Letting him normalize his breathing, I raised myself to catch his bruised wrists in my hands to caress and massage them."You already know no one makes me cum like you," I confessed to him as I caressed his hands and tried to make the blood circulation in them normal again. He smirked, full of himself. "I'm glad you liked it, did I hurt you too much?"Fred giggled and passed his hands around my waist to push me back against his chest."No, darling, I'm still a bit gone but I promise it's okay. I could get used to it," he winked at me, cupping my cheek to then kiss me slowly. "You were bloody awesome."He had me 

 at his feet.

After leaving a quick kiss on my cheek, Fred stood up from bed and started rambling, with only his boxers hanging carelessly from his hips, all over my room. He put on one of the vinyl records and started looking through my notebooks."Didn't know you could draw," he smiled, showing me one of the many portraits of Liv I had in my notebook, next to a pretty realistic one of Remus."There are many things you don't know about me," I tried to sound mysterious. "I don't draw as often as I used to do it before, though.""Why not?""Don't have time."He tightened his lips and continued glancing over the paper until he found something that made him smile widely."What is this?""What?""Is this me, Lilith?" he scoffed, showing me the portrait of him I did more than a year ago when he still had his long hair and that baby face. I felt a huge burst of flush all over my body. Shit. Shit. Shit."It's not, put that back on its place," I said too quickly to be taken seriously. Fred giggled and continued admiring his portrait. "Fred!""Make me," he teased me. I attempted to put my feet on the floor and stand up but my legs failed me making me fall on the bed again. I spluttered hearing the ginger's amused laugh and tried to look as threatening as possible."Fred...don't fucking get on my nerves.""Don't get mad, darling! I think it's really beautiful-" he smiled in an innocent tone, going back to lay by my side. I tried to take the notebook off his hands but he tutted, moving it from my reach. "No, Lilith. I want to keep looking at it, I feel so flattered! It looks so real it could be a picture, who taught you to draw like this?""I learnt by myself. There aren't many things to do during summer at the Arambella House," I replied without thinking. Fuck, I'm talking too much."It's really cool," Fred whispered, changing the topic, noticing the Arambella House wasn't a nice point for me."You can keep it if you want to," I have like five other drawings of you really well saved under my bed.His eyes opened with excitement and joy, "Really?""Yes!"He instantly wrapped his arms around me, filling my cheeks and my neck with quick, warm and soft kisses, having me laughing under him."You two better be dressed! We're already home!" Liv's voice sounded behind the door after knocking, accompanied by both Lin and George's chuckles.I looked at Fred, trying uselessly to hold back my smile;"Why do we always get caught?"✵ ✵ ✵"Lilith," Khaleelah called me and I turned around to find her with her broom. "after the match, we'll be going out for some drinks - no alcohol for me, obvs - if we don't end up too wounded, would you like to come?"I smiled at her, feeling so happy to be included in the friend group the entire team had formed."Sure!""Great, we have a little break before we start. See you in the changing room."I nodded and kept stretching while sitting on the grass to make sure I didn't get any muscle cramps. In the distance, I saw Fred sitting next to George, Liv and Pauline. Tonks told me Remus couldn't come because of how hard the full moon hit him this last month so I had already planned to visit him during the night to make sure he was okay. The ginger's eyes met mine for a brief moment and he winked at me giving me a proud gaze."Ready to beat the Falcons?" a deep voice spoke behind me. I slightly turned around and found Devyan in his training clothes, with his hands in the pockets of his trousers and a slightly cocky pose."Bet, mate," I stood up from the grass and gave Fred one last look, he had his eyes fixed on Khan and he seemed far from being happy with his presence. "Are you watching the match?""Of course," he snorted as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "I'm playing against you next week.""True, a week before my birthday."He clicked his tongue, cynically. "Oh, come on! Don't tell me I'm gonna make you lose as a gift for your nineteens!""Pff! You wished! I'm gonna smash you as a gift for my nineteens."The boy who whistled at him the last time we saw each other passed behind him, giving a little clap in Devyan's back. Khan followed the other boy's path with his eyes, carefully, and I distinguished a peculiar bright on them."Who's that?"Devyan put his eyes back on me."A teammate."I narrowed my eyes, suspiciously."Only a teammate?"He snickered, looking at his feet and then raising his eyes again with a mischievous smile on his face, making the scar in his eye slightly wrinkle."Did anyone ever tell you you're a bit too observant?"I shrugged. "Maybe. I like to know what's going on around me.""How nosy of you," he smiled."You don't have to worry, though. I'm not gonna judge you, I'm not straight either."His smile widened and he messed up my hair a little bit. I complained but used the opportunity to finally tie up my hair. "Go on, your match is about to start, little nosy.""Yeah, bet you wanna go meet your dear teammates, don't you, Khan?" I scoffed, walking backwards straight to my changing room."Off you go!"✵ ✵ ✵Khaleelah scored again and I hit my bludger with all the strength in my body when one of the other team's Beaters tried to throw her off her broom. The audience howled and whooped excited, the field was always almost full but today, it seemed like it was more crowded than ever. The Falcons were playing hard. Really hard. We were winning by a short difference of three points and the aggressiveness and violence they used at the field was something I hadn't experienced in a long long time, not even in my matches against Gryffindor back in the day. Aileen was flying faster than ever, almost imperceptible by anyone's eyes as she looked for the Snitch before the other Seeker, having more than one of the other players trying to knock her down.Gwenog blocked one of the Chasers from scoring and the crowd shouted with joy again. I flew beside Khaleelah as soon as she got the Quaffle and protected her from the Bludger, letting her score again. I managed to block another of the shots from another Chaser and I heard the entire audience cheering.I was trying to catch again the Bludger when one of the Beaters from the other team - two times my height and being an actual tank - slammed himself against my left arm. A painful current burst in my body and I fell off my broom. The public held their gasps when I managed to grab my broomstick, feeling my arm numb and hanging in the air, I force myself to push my body up and sit again. The referee whistled to stop the game since the boy had flown straight to me without having the ball, which was considered Blatching. The crowd shouted annoyed and I tried to move my arm. Fuck, it hurt."That's not fair play!" I heard Liv protested."You fucking bastard!" George and Pauline followed him, shouting while George had his hand around Fred's wrist, trying to pull him back to his seat. He was glaring at the player who hurt me and he looked like he was restraining himself from cursing him."Carter didn't touch her!" the Captain and Keeper of the Falcons, protested at the referee. Khaleelah flew in front of me with her eyebrows frowned and red with rage."He didn't touch her?! How dare you?! He nearly breaks her arm and makes her fall off her broom!""Are you okay, Lilith?" Aileen asked me, looking genuinely worried."It's called 'playing hard', Zahir. Bet the wimps you have for players don't know what that means. What can we expect from a team only formed by women?" he giggled.The anger filled me from the tip of my toes to my head and suddenly the pain had disappeared. I moved my arm and grabbed hardly my bat and my broom, looking daggers at the other team."I'm okay, let's keep playing," I spat, and the referee whistled again. The Quaffle was ours and I made sure to play even rougher than before, using all the strength that my injured arm let me. The Falcons didn't score again and Aileen trapped the Snitch fifteen minutes after the incident. We whooped at the victory and gladly rubbed it in at the other team, watching their angry pathetic faces.Once I put my feet on the ground, losing the adrenaline, the pain hit me again and all the girls came quickly at me."Lilith, you sure you're good?" Gwenog asked me, speaking for all of them."You should let us check if they have wounded you," Khaleelah approached me, worried, and the rest nodded."Fine, let's check. But only because I want to be in full shape for our match against the Bats."The girls guided me back to the changing room and made me sit while Khaleelah and Aileen examined my arm. I complained in a hiss when they moved it."Is it broken?" Wilda, one of the other Chasers asked."No, I don't think so." Khaleelah quickly replied, focused on the wound. The skin in my arm was a bit irritated and swollen and I felt a persistent pain in it."Lilith," I heard Liv's voice in the entrance of the changing room and the girls opened the circle around me to see her. She didn't wait to run and kneel in front of me, immediately focusing on my arm.Khaleelah scowled, confused."She's my best friend," I whispered to the Chaser and she relaxed her expression, nodding."Let me see your arm," Olivia ordered with her sweet and soft tone. I extended it as much as I could."Can it be healed with magic?" Aileen asked, looking directly at Liv."Yeah, but she will have it a bit affected for a couple of weeks. It's a serious wound, that beast could've dislocated her arm."I heard how Khaleelah snorted and I saw Gwenog shaking her head."They're savages," the Captain murmured."Mysoginist savages," Zahir added.Liv stretched my arm and put her wand against it. The cold tip felt like a weird relief over the swollen and hot skin and I hissed. The blonde made sure to grip my arm, careful but firmly. She performed a couple of healing spells under all the Harpies' curious eyes, if there was someone who knew about healing magic, that was Olivia."That's it," she said six spells later, with a proud dim smile on her face. "Try not to move it too aggressively at least this week and I'll make sure to put the spells on you every day, ok? We can prepare as well that healing potion your uncle used with the Slytherin team."I nodded, feeling so thankful for having Liv always by my side."So, should we call the team's nurse or not?" Gala, the Keeper, spoke after a brief silence."Nah, it's not necessary. She will be fine," Liv helped me to stand up."Have that drink for me, girls!" I waved at them as my friend guided me out of the changing room."Nah, we aren't doing any celebration with you being hurt," Khaleelah shook her head and the rest agreed.I clicked my tongue. "Bah! We won, that's what matters. Besides, I'll be having a beer at my place so you lot better celebrate as well our victory over those cavemen."Outside the changing room Pauline, George and Fred were waiting, impatiently, for us. Pauline and George seemed actually worried, but Fred was slightly paler than usual and his eyes shined with the concern in them."Lilith, how are you?" he quickly spoke before I could say anything."That son of a bitch crossed the line," George added, and Pauline nodded behind him."I will be fine. It's just a little wound."None of them seemed to believe me, but they stayed silent."I'll be healing her every day, I put every spell I could think of at that moment and she's okay but it will be a bit bruised for a couple of weeks," Liv explained, interlacing her hand with mine."I'm not gonna die, lads. You aren't getting rid of me this soon, for fuck's sake," I rolled my eyes at their exaggeration but also feeling really flattered at their worrisome for my health. "I need to go to Remus's place, I promised him I'd visit him today but can't appear myself when I'm wounded. Do you mind be the amazing, incredible and precious friends you are and accompany me to his block?"They smiled at me and nodded at the same time.✵ ✵ ✵While Liv, Lin and the twins waited down in the street, sharing a cig together, I went upstairs to knock on Remus's door. Tonks opened to me with a pale face and the most serious face I have seen on her. My instincts alerted me."Dora? Is everything okay?"She tried to smile but it didn't reach her face. "It's Remus. As I told you, this full moon was terrible. He's healing too slow."I didn't wait any longer to enter the place and go straight to the man's bedroom. He was laying down on his bed, reading a book, looking peaceful and calm but the scars on his face were bright and visible and the deterioration in his appearance scared me."Remus," I ran to sit by his side and he gave me the biggest smile he could."Oh, good night, dear, how 're you?" his smile faded when he saw the bandage around my arm. "What happened to you?! Are you hurt?!"I clicked my tongue, playing down. "I'm okay, just a little Quidditch wound, the important thing here is; how are you? You look tired."He dimly smiled at me again and put his hand behind my head to make me lay by his side, hugging me. I wrapped my arms tightly around him feeling more protected than ever."I'm tired, dear. I'm an old werewolf, not all of us live this long and I feel my body doesn't heal as fast as it used to do when I was younger."I looked at him worried, without separating from his paternal and warm hug. I couldn't lose Remus. He was the closest thing I have had to a caring and loving father."You are not going to die, are you, Remus?" I murmured, in a muffled voice. He giggled, surprising me."No, Lilith, I'm not dying. At least not this soon. I have to last enough to see you becoming a grown woman and marrying Fred," he winked at me and I felt my blood concentrating in my cheeks."Remus! Don't high my empty hopes like this!" I softly palmed his chest, scowling, but unable to erase the little grin forming on the corners of my lips. "But you aren't that old!... forgive me for mentioning him, but Greyback is way older than you and he's still pretty much alive, the bloody bastard."Lupin caressed my hair, affectionately, letting out a long sigh. "I know, but he's stronger than me, Lilith, you need to know that. He doesn't restrain his wolf. He lets him free. I can't do that with mine.""You should if restrain it puts in danger your health," I quickly replied."No, it's too dangerous. But I promise you I'll be fine, dear. Tonks just got scared when she saw me but I promise you I'm okay. Just tired.""And the wolfsbane?"Since I moved and lost all the contact with my uncle, I was the one preparing the wolfsbane for Remus, and even though it helped him to control himself and was the most advanced potion for werewolves, it still contained literal poison and could damage him even more."'S okay, working as usual. Where are Liv and the rest, by the way?" he changed the topic, trying to spurn the attention from him."Waiting down there. They thought you would want some privacy.""Oh, how bad," he tutted, "I wanted to give the great announcement to all of you together.""Which announcement?" I frowned my eyebrows, confused.His smile widened, mischievous and mysterious."Listen to me, I'll invite all of you to the Leaky Cauldron this Saturday, ok? There I'll tell you what it is.""Can't you give a little hint?" I smiled at him, faking my puppy eyes.He shook his head, amused. "No, dear, you little nosy mind will find out at the same time as the rest."He left a little kiss on my forehead, snickering at my complaining sound, and went back to hug me as tightly as his weak condition allowed him.

Liv kept healing my arm during the next days and on Saturday, two days before the match against the Ballycastle Bats, it was almost back to normal."So," George started, turning his chair backwards and straddling it. "what's the news, Lupin?"Liv, Fred and Pauline gave a sip to their butterbeer at the same time while staring curiously at the man. Remus let a little smile appear on his face.The Leaky Cauldron, as every weekend, was almost full but we managed to get one of the most isolated tables and have a bit more privacy."Here, have this," Remus searched in the pocket of his jacket and took out a chocolate bar, giving each of us a piece."Remus..." I looked at him, trying to make him get to the point.He took a deep breath."There has been some news. Apparently, the Death Eaters who escaped are trying to get back to their previous status. They want back the power they once lost and even though Grimmauld is officially only Harry's property, we can't be completely sure they won't be trying to reach other things related to them, " he stared straightly at me, "that they consider valued and precious.""And what have you thought?" Pauline asked, a bit confused, grabbing Liv's hand under the table."We can't do much against Dolohov and Rockwood, and-" Remus swallowed hard, "Sirius already fucked up Bellatrix by taking away the Black fortune from her reach and giving it to Harry. But there's someone we can fuck up a lot with a simple move.""Circe." I completed, with cold shivers running down my spine. Remus nodded."Your uncle once said you are what she wants the most in the world and with all the records about you existing in the Wizarding World... it won't be difficult for her to find you, actually, I'm surprised she hasn't done it by now.""But we aren't letting that bitch get anywhere near Lilith, right?" George said, pretty confident."We definitely aren't," Fred confirmed, looking more serious than usual."That's why I had an idea. It might sound mental and maybe you don't agree with it but, Lilith-" Remus caught my hand in his. "If we secretly change your last name in the records at the Ministry, we could gain some advantage. You know in the lists only appear your initials and your last name, you're the only Arambella in the Wizarding World.""Do you mean I should change the Arambella?"Stop carrying Ares's last name. Stop showing everywhere I'm the daughter he left behind."Yes, that's exactly what I mean.""Lilith, that is actually a great idea! Dad told me they don't usually keep a deep count of every single wizard registered, at least not when Fudge was the Minister, so if someone from the Order manages to get the register and change your last name, no one would notice!" Liv smiled, excited at the idea."And whose last name I'm going to take? I can't take any of the purebloods, that's obvs, and I can't go out there without a last name.""Well, if you like, of course, only if you like," Remus quickly replied, "you could have mine. I know it's not a very well respected last name and you won't get any special favour carrying it but...it can keep you protected from Circe as long as you don't confront each other face to face."I held my breath. Lupin. Lilith Medea Lupin."Of course I want, Remus," my voice trembled in a little smile. The fact that Remus cared so much about me to even offer me his last name as a way to escape from my mother meant the whole world to me. "It would be such an honour."His smile widened. "Then, welcome to the little kinda-broken Lupin family, my daughter."I had to take my hand to my mouth to hold my tears, as our accompaniment clapped cheerfully.Now, the only trail of Ares over me were my own memories."We will have to wait till Christmas to change it since it's when the Ministry is less crowded and we can draw a bit the attention away from you. Oh, and of course, this doesn't mean you lot don't have to still keep some security measures and take care, do you understand?" Remus pointed at all of us, with a severe look, making us quickly nod. "We already were lucky enough The Prophet didn't publish anything about Lilith being a Harpie, otherwise this idea wouldn't work."We kept enjoying our butterbeer and chatting between us until Tonks arrived and joined us as well, giving me a huge hug when I gave her the news."So, Lilith," Fred started, catching quickly all the attention and giving me a mischievous smile. "Does this mean you will be carrying a Gryffindor's last name?""Oh, fuck off, Freddie!"✵ ✵ ✵"Ready to lose, Lilith?" Devyan smirked at me, giving me an accomplice look, dressed in his equipment and looking fierce. He was one of the best Seekers I have seen so I would lie if I said I wasn't a bit worried, but I would die before admitting it aloud."Are you, Devyan?" I imitated his expression, standing in front of him with my arms crossed.He snickered shaking his head and slightly biting his lower lip."We will see up there in the air," his eyes went discreetly to the terraces where George and Liv's faces were almost covered in golden and dark green paint - the colours of the Harpies - while Fred and Pauline had two stripes in their cheeks painted and Remus was waving a little flag with the logo and a huge smile on his face. "Your ginger came to cheerlead you?""He is not 'my' ginger, Devyan. He's just my friend.""Look how quickly you knew who I was talking about!" he scoffed and I snorted, slightly amused. "You know I used to say Rei was also just my friend and nowadays he's my boyfriend?" Devyan whispered, still with that big smile on his face."So Rei, huh?" I teased him, raising my eyebrows."Rei Arai, yes," Devyan replied, pretty proud, crossing his arms in front of his chest. "But that's not what we're talking about, little nosy. Your ginger is probably looking at us right now.""Oh, really, and how do you know, smart-ass?""Easy, since the first time we talked again, he always has his eyes on you," Devyan stated, obvious. "And since I adore to mess with Weasley, let me pretend I take an eyelash from your pretty cheek" he winked at me while slowly running his thumb under my right eye, making sure Fred could see in the distance what was happening.I looked discreetly and briefly at him and, as Devyan said, he had his eyes fixed on us, with his jaw slightly clenched and playing with the rings in his fingers. I swallowed hard at the harshness of his eyes and took my look back to Khan."I'll have to deal with his bad mood later because of your fun," I complained and Devyan giggled."Don't worry, little nosy, he will be completely fine, ready to console you, after my team smashes yours," he started to walk backwards - right to where his team was having the last training - winking at me."In your dreams, mate!"✵ ✵ ✵Devyan almost slammed himself against my wounded arm, flying by my side, at the exact velocity to make it seem as if it wasn't planned so it wouldn't be considered as an offence. The damn son of a bitch was sharp. The part of the crowd which was cheering us whooped when I managed to avoid him and I heard Fred and George shouting, especially Fred;"WE SEE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO, YOU BASTARD! PLAY FAIR!"He was right when he said his team had us deeply studied and apparently, the last information they needed about me was my recent wound. Since the game started, they tried to show how they knew almost all of our strategies and techniques and were ready to fight them back. But again, it was almost, not all of them.I whistled flying by Khaleelah's side and the whole team changed the defence plan, making the Bats look a bit clueless. I was right too when I said I would tell the girls to change our way of playing, and if there was someone out there who used her creativity and hard work at Quidditch, that was Zahir.Gwenog and I hit the Bludgers at the same time and threw them to the two Chasers who were dangerously approaching our Keeper's area. We stopped them from scoring, making one of them almost fall from his broom.The results were pretty tied and I only begged for Aileen to catch the Snitch soon. One of the other Chasers from our team whistled again and we changed the attack plan.Ten minutes later, Aileen made three loops in the air whooping of pure joy and showing the golden ball in her hand. Everyone burst into whoops and cheers, clapping. Since the results were so even before catching the Snitch, we won them with a difference of only 151 points, but it was a victory. That was what mattered.We got to the ground and joined into a huge and tight team hug jumping and hearing the crowd almost shouting with joy."WE FUCKING DONE IT!""FOUR VICTORIES IN A ROW, HARPIES, THIS IS OUR MOTHERFUCKING YEAR.""Well done, girls!" Khaleelah separated a bit, still smiling, to catch air with a hand on her chest."Congratulations, Lilith," I heard that familiar voice behind me. I turned around with a cocky smile on my face."Thanks, Devyan. Glad to know you know how to lose, even though you tried to break my arm again."He snickered."Don't take it too personal, pretty face. It was the only weakness I could see on you," he shrugged. "We're good, though?""Sure! Now that I won you we obviously are good," I smiled at him and he opened his arms ready to give me a hug. I corresponded it feeling a bit overwhelmed by his fragrance and his tall body."I was going to say if I had won you, I would have invited you to a pint but since you were the one winning me, you'll be inviting me one of these days, won't you, Lilith?""Yeah, why not?" I shrugged, grinning."Great! Gotta leave you, I have to comfort Rei. He's a bit of a bad loser.""Tell him I say 'hi' and 'sorry for the Bludger'!""LILITH!" Liv shouted from across the field, running at me, being followed by Pauline, the twins and Remus behind. The blonde glued to me in a huge hug almost painting me in green and golden and throwing me to the ground. "THAT WAS BLOODY AMAZING!""IT REALLY WAS, I LOVED THE WAY ALL OF YOU WERE COMPENETRATED! PUTAIN, IT WAS SO GOOD!" Pauline smiled, excited. Lately, she was getting really interested in Quidditch."Thanks, girls!" I hugged them both and after hugging too Remus and George - who gave me a full rant about the game, which I listened gladly - my eyes focused on Fred. He had a little smile on his face and his eyes covered me from up to down. He opened his arms and I went to hug him as well, a bit confused and with all my emotions for him wandering in my mind. The only feeling of his corporal heat and his body against mine made me so weak at him that I wanted to never move from in between his arms."Well done, darling," he whispered in my ear, making the quivers ran through my spine and down to in between my legs. "You played incredibly good and...you pissed me off again."I froze in my place. Oh, Merlin, what have I done now?"Come again?" I whispered too."Flirting with Khan in front of my own eyes, huh? Bet you had fun, didn't you?" Fred tutted while his thumb moved slightly, caressing my back. "I truly hope you actually did because I'm gonna have my little revenge, darling."I separated a bit from him and he had still his smile but the fire in his eyes almost burnt me. I tried to hide how nervous and impatient I actually was by giving him another arrogant smile."Are you going to punish me, Freddie?" I teased him in a lower murmur that only Fred could hear.His smile changed into a dim smirk and he took his hand to my cheek."Oh, you can be sure about it, darling. I'm not going to make you suffer how you did with me, though. I'm going to show you no one can please you as I do. I'm going to fuck you so good you are going to forget anybody else fucked you before."The bonfire grew inside my guts and I had to clear my throat to remain calm. I crossed my arms in front of my chest, under Fred's amused stare."You sound too sure about it.""You'll see how sure I am about it once you're in my bed," he murmured, gazing at my lips. "Now we're going with our mates and Remus for a couple of beers to celebrate your victory and then, I want you to sneak to my room, clear?"I gave him a feline smile."Clear."✵ ✵ ✵When I finally got to my room, it felt like taking fresh air. Fred had been slowly torturing me the whole time we were together at the Leaky Cauldron before our friends, who seemed not to notice the incredible tension around us. He gave me long looks, licked his lips, stretched his body giving me a full look of it, snickered with that deep voice that turned me on like a match...He was making me yearn for him. He was making me burn for him.After saying goodbye to Remus, I basically ran to my flat, followed by Liv and Pauline who were talking between them. Once in my dorm, I tried to calm down before jumping to Fred's balcony, but it was useless. I need him. I need him now.I opened the door of my balcony and managed to pass to Fred's without sliding into the little space that separated it from mine. I knocked softly on the window and after waiting a couple of seconds, a ginger boy opened it, receiving me with a huge accomplice smile. Weasley, but not the Weasley I was expecting."George-" I opened my eyes widely, trying to find any excuse to explain why I was trying to enter his flat a couple of hours before midnight."Oh, Lilith, you're already here?" he interrupted me, with his usual calm and normal tone. "Come in, come in. Fred will be here in a second, he was having a shower to take off the paint from his face."George made me enter his twin's dorm while he looked for something in his wardrobe and I sat on the bed."I'm trying to find one of the hoodies this git stole from me," he said before I could ask, still looking for it."Are you going somewhere?""Yes, I'm going with Liv and Lin. They're gonna teach me how to do those handmade bracelets, you know? I like them, and if I learn to do them properly, I want to give Angie one and then, maybe incorporate them in some way to the shop.""That's nice," I smiled at him. "How are things going with her?""Really good, actually. We don't want to make things official yet because of everything going on right now but, it's going well! That's what matters,""Yeah, you two have time enough for that. She's working for the Quibbler now with Lee, right?""Yes, she's a bit busy but she loves it- Oh, here it is! Shit, finally," George put on the piece of clothing, proud of himself. "Well, I'm leaving. Do you mind if I use your balcony?"Snickering, I pointed to the window."Please, go on."His smile widened and leaving a little and quick kiss on my cheek, he went straight to it."Thanks, mate. Have fun and be careful, I'm still too young to be the hot sexy uncle," he winked at me, already passing to my flat.My whole body trembled at his words."Oh, shut up, Georgie. Worry first about not falling or you won't be an uncle at all."He waved at me once he was in my room and then quickly disappeared from my sight to meet my two friends.The door of the room opened again and Fred slowly and peacefully entered with the short towel hanging shamelessly of his hips. He smiled at me. My eyes covered his body from up to down; his skin seemed smooth and soft under the dim moonlight, his hair was still a bit wet and his eyes shined black, looking like if they belonged to a wild animal. However, he was calmed and relaxed, as if he had all the time in the world. Oh, Merlin, I would lie if I say I didn't get lost in the masterpiece he had for a body."Enjoying the view, darling?"I smiled at him, crossing my legs."It is a good reception.""You know you have annoyed me a lot today, right?" he crossed his strong arms in front of his chest. Even though time had gone by since he played Quidditch, the mark of it on his god-like body was still present."Did I? Good to know, then" I teased him, pretending I didn't care when actually I was longing for him to touch me already."You did. I was so happy about watching you destroying Khan at the field, especially after our little encounter," he approached me, lowering his voice and making it deeper. "and what do I find? He flirting shamelessly with you. In front of me. And you smiling at him," Fred tutted. "I didn't like it. Not a bit.""Are you jealous, Freddie?" I murmured and he kneeled right in front of me."I fucking am, darling," he confessed, looking at me straight in the eye and smirking. The devilish and most primal part of my mind jumped and roared with joy. "And, as I told you, I'm going to have my precious little revenge."I was fucked up.

Before I could say a word, Fred trapped my lips into his in a slow and sweet kiss that made me melt at his touch, with his hand caressing my cheek. As I put my arms around his neck, he came closer to me, making the kiss deeper and wilder, gaining a hotter ambience."Do you remember the safe word?" Fred asked, separating for me.I nodded, swallowing hard."Which one is it? Tell me so I'm sure you know.""Blueberry."His smile widened."Stand up, take off all of your clothes and lay on the bed again" he ordered with a low voice that sent shivers all over my body.I obeyed, slowly pulling down the clothes on my body, under his eager stare. Every inch of my skin woke up with the soft air wrapping around me and Fred's dark eyes covering me from up to down with his arrogant smile. Keeping eye contact with him, I let myself fall again over the bed, without taking off my knickers, watching Fred tut.Every pore in my skin screamed for his attention and silently begged for him to touch me. Fred looked burning, tempting and captivating as if he had been handcrafted by the Gods. The veins in his hands and arms stood out more than usual and his ginger hair contrasted with the blueish light in the dorm similar to a persistent bonfire in the darkness. Merlin, I needed him."Ah-ah, darling, I said all," he kneeled on the bed, getting in between my legs and grabbing the last piece of clothing on my body to pull it down aggressively. Spreading more my legs in the way, he smiled, looking at how exposed he had me, and placed himself in the space separating us, getting closer to me. "Look at you, Lilith, I haven't even touched you yet and you're already all soaked and ready for me. How pretty."I decided to play even more with him."And how do you know I'm this wet for you?"Fred hissed and slid a hand straight to my neck, without putting too much pressure but reminding me his fingers were right there, claiming the control over me and with that arrogant smirk still on his lips."Don't provoke me even more, Lilith," he mumbled against my lips, starting to place soft and short kisses on my jaw to slowly draw a path to my neck. "You already pissed me off enough flirting with that daft prick of Khan."Fred's tongue played with the piercings of my nipples and his lips sucked the skin of my breasts, gaining a soft and muffled moan leaving my mouth. His hands squeezed delicately my hips and I could feel his hardness against me through the towel."Freddie..." I panted, tilting my head back, as his mouth was dangerously approaching where I was aching for him."That's it, darling. Me, not him," he grabbed my thighs and started to kiss and softly bite their inner part. "He doesn't know how to make you drip like this, does he?"Having his lips so close to my wetness made me move my hips, desperate for his touch as he kept kissing my skin."Answer when you are spoken to, be a good girl for me.""He doesn't," I managed to mutter intermittently once his thumb drew the outline of my clit without fully touching it.Oh, Freddie, if you knew you are the only one that I want."Aha, that's right. He doesn't know which is your weak spot, am I right? How you writhe at the minimum touch as the craving and desperate little slut you are or how soft your skin is." his finger finally met my clit and I panted again, receiving waves of pleasure covering me like poured honey all from the tip of my toes to my head. Slowly, with patience, very difficult to appreciate - torturing. "He doesn't know either how beautiful you look and sound when you cum. No, he doesn't. And you know why, darling?""Because-" you are the one, I wanted to say, but my own moan interrupted me as Fred slid two of his fingers from his other hand inside of me."Because I'm the lucky one who gets to know it. Who gets to see it firsthand. Because you are my precious and needy Lilith, darling. And I don't like sharing." He moved his hands to grab my thighs at each side of his face, and before I could complain at the lack of his touch, he lowered himself, spat on my pussy and ran his tongue from my entrance to my clit in a slow but intense lick. "Mine."Fred snarled against me, sending vibrations all over my body when a loud moan rasped my throat.Fuck, I was entirely at his mercy. Instead of rejecting the possessiveness in his voice, I felt more turned on than ever. My most primal part roared internally with joy.I'm yours, Freddie. As long as this lasts and even after, I'm completely yours.He made his lips surround my clit and start sucking and licking it, his nose buried in my skin as his hands caressed the sides of my thighs and he ate me out like a wild thirsty animal. I clenched my legs around him, feeling overwhelmed by the sharp but sweet sensation of Fred kissing me down there, making a whole mess of me. He hummed against me in approval, noticing my clit throbbing and pulsating in his tongue. "This is how I wanted to have you, darling. This is my good girl. The most addictive drug someone can try."His hands moved briefly to caress my breasts as the movement of his tongue became slightly faster, making me whimper."Fred... p-please, fuck me. Please."His lips moved to my entrance to tease me and drink of me as his nose grazed against my clit making me gasp."Not yet, darling. Let me savour you a little more."Fred sank again two of his fingers inside of me, twisting them as I panted, feeling the familiar knot already forming in my guts. His lips burnt me in the most delicious way possible and I was so close to seeing the stars that it almost felt like if there wasn't a ceiling over us."I'm g-going to cum!" I whined, moving my hips uselessly since he was holding me still. His eyes met mine as he showed me how he slid his tongue in circles over my clit. "Fuck!""Cum for me, darling," he murmured in a hoarse voice that only drove me closer to my climax. "Cum all over my face like the good girl that you are."I felt every nerve in my body exploding in a hard orgasm as a loud moan left my lips, my eyes closed and I saw white dots because of the pure ecstasy, my lungs struggled to catch the air while I pulled his hair to make him be even closer to me. With me still at the peak of the rollercoaster and fully overstimulated, Fred's tongue moved over me in a new way as if he was writing with it in cursive.Even though my head felt dizzy because of the intensity of my own climax, I tried to focus again on his mouth over my pussy; f...r...e...d.Fred.He was writing his own name on me with his tongue."So bloody beautiful," he whispered, leaving the last kiss on my sensitive and pulsating wetness.He grabbed my hands softly and made me sit on my knees. Before I could say a word, his hand caressing my cheek travelled to my waist and turned me around to find the mirror in front of us. Fred smirked looking at me through the glass and putting his other hand in my neck - glueing my back to his chest, letting me feel all his body against mine - as the other one moved to below my belly.I saw my eyes shining in desire for him, my mouth slightly opened and my entire body breathing heavily and eager for him. Fred's lips met the soft skin of my neck as his hand travelled in between my legs to caress my overstimulated clit again."Fuck!" I gasped, tilting my head back and holding his hand on my neck, watching the incredible view in the mirror.He moved his fingers and suddenly, two of them were sunk inside of me."Whose fingers are inside your desperate pussy, darling?" he scoffed, whispering softly in my ear while thrusting into me incredibly slow, letting me feel my own wetness soaking his hand. "Who is the one pleasing you?""Y-you!" I stuttered, feeling every nerve on my skin about to explode."That's right, love. Don't you dare to forget it, a'right?" he kissed my cheek softly while the movement of his hand hurried up inside of me.My climax arrived as soon as Fred pulled my hair, making me stare straightly into the mirror and see how he twisted his finger deeper while his lips covered my collarbones."Freddie!" I couldn't help but whimper once the pleasure in my body invaded me, driving to the peak of the rollercoaster.The ginger turned me around again to face him, he slammed his lips against mine in a passionate and claiming kiss that made me melt at his touch and lose my breath as he made me lay down on the bed again."Now you won't forget who ruins you like this, darling.""Are you going to finally fuck me or do I have to get from downstairs a vibrator and do it myself?" I teased, trying to catch air again, giving him a feline look as I ran my hands slowly all over my body.He chuckled, arrogantly and put again his hand in my neck, pressing slightly more than before."I'm the one fucking you tonight, beautiful," Fred whispered against my lips, piercing my eyes with his. "And you better keep this pretty bitchy mouth of yours shut unless is to moan. You are going to lay there and enjoy it as the perfect little whore you are for me and only for me, understood?"I imitated his arrogant smile, moving my hips against his hard and throbbing erection."Understood."He smiled and fused our lips together in an intimate and burning kiss in which we both tried to claim as much as possible from the other one. His hand went from my neck to grab his dick and rub his tip all from my entrance to my clit, especially teasing my entrance as I whimpered, too soaked to wait."I want you to keep your eyes opened when I enter inside of you," he stated, with that cocky smile that was driving me crazy. "And keep in mind, darling, that if I don't tie you up as you did with me is because I want to feel your nails deeply dug in my back while I fuck you.""Whatever you want, but do it now," I whined, pressing my forehead against his and grinding my hips again, feeling him throbbing already ahead of time."Beg me," he teased me, again.And I smiled back, to then look at him faking a pout and puppy eyes."Please, Freddie, I've been a good girl, fuck me once and for fucking all, you wanker" I drawled with the fakest and kinda high-pitched voice.Fred giggled in a deep voice, "What a bitch you are, my darling.""And a proud one."He gazed at my whole body below him, biting his lower lip."So fucking beautiful..." Fred rubbed again his tip, making me even more desperate. "I know I wasn't your first one," he swallowed hard, running his thumb over my lips, " but I intend to be your best."Fucking hell, Freddie.Before I could say anything else, he buried himself inside of me in a hard but slow thrust, pushing and letting me feel him completely. His hand went back to my neck and a moan left my mouth as I felt myself throbbing at the filling sensation.He moved back, not pulling out entirely, and thrust hard into me again, moaning raspy."Always so fucking good," Fred murmured, with a laboured breath, grazing his lips with mine, and pushing deeper, making me take all of him. "You wrap around me so madly good...it's like you were made for me.""Freddie..." I panted with his hips crashing against mine in a bewitching melody and the roughness of his movements driving me crazy. His tip quickly found my weak spot and he rubbed it hard. I felt every single drop of good sense leaving my body."Do I feel good too, darling?" he teased me, in a sinful way, slowing his movements to let me fully feel how he went in and out and how deep he was actually going.Fuck.I nodded. Speechless, and with my nails digging in his back, scratching him, and listening to how another raspy and low moan left his lips."Use your words.""So good - so fucking good," I whispered, having his body burning me and devouring me. I was weak for him. Really weak. Fred rocked his hips, making me feel his pulsating dick hitting hard my weakest spot. I trembled in between his arms as he bit softly my neck. The pressure in my hips felt unbearable and I came with an intense orgasm that sent currents of pleasure all over my body. My walls clenched around him and a loud whimper left his throat in a way that increased, even more, my oversensitivity, feeling at the highest peak of my climax."Fuuuuck!" I cried out, with his hands dug in my hips and my nails scratching his back."My Lilith...such a good girl."Fred moved his hands and made me lift my legs, pressing my thighs against my chest."Keep your legs like this, darling."I obeyed, grabbing the back of my knees and feeling my walls tightening around him as he felt going even deeper."Oh, fuck," he whimpered, starting to thrust again as hard and rough as before. His chest moving up and down violently, his mouth opened wide and his bare body was kinda sweaty as the moonlight illuminated his clenched muscles."It feels so good, Freddie..." I whined, having his full size stretching me roughly. He was the fucking paradise made as a man."What a pretty view I have from here, angel," he scoffed, pushing harder, deep buried in me. "All mine. All fucking mine.""I'm pretty much everything but an angel right now, Freddie," I winked at him, giving him a devilish smirk.Fred rocked his hips faster and I felt myself melting under him. I hissed, full of pleasure when his dick pulsated and throbbed inside of me, twitching. The usual knot formed again, as my overstimulated body and clit felt more sensitive than ever while Fred kept claiming me. He noticed I was going to cum again, so he put more pressure on my neck - not enough to hurt me or overwhelm me, but enough to remind me his hand was there - and stopped moving. I whimpered, complaining."Freddie-" I held my breath, trying to get him to move again as I felt painfully close to the edge. Every part of my body craving that orgasm. "Freddie, please""Tell me you are mine, Lilith," he stared straight into my eyes, with his laboured breath and messy ginger hair. "I want to hear you saying it."I'm all and entirely yours."I'm mine, darling, and maybe a bit yours too," I teased him, kissing his neck.He trapped my face in his hand and softly grazing his lips against mine, he grinned;"Maybe?"He didn't move."Fine. Without the 'maybe'," I confessed, already desperate."And?" he kept teasing me, rubbing his nose with mine."There's no 'and'. Just mine and... yours." I swallowed hard and felt completely naked in front of him. In an obvious physical way, but also in an emotional one, which made me feel slightly relieved but also terrified.His smile widened and Fred started thrusting into me again, slamming his hips into my skin and rubbing my weakest spot.Fuck... priorities first, I'll have time later to deal with my emotions.My climax approached even faster than before and I whined as Fred moaned, moving his hips even faster and rougher.A current of pleasure hit me hard and I clenched around him, with my whole body trembling and my eyes closing to let me see the stars and fireworks. My head went dizzy and every inch of my skin roared in delicious relief."How pretty...coming just for me," Fred praised "Fuck, I can't hold it anymore," he whimpered, and then tilted his head back, letting a loud and raspy moan out of his mouth as he came inside of me in a throbbing and intense orgasm that covered him from up to down, making him slightly tremble.I put down my trembling legs and Fred pulled out of me to let himself rest by my side, catching air. I rolled on top of him, still needy of his nearness, and tried to normalize my breathing at the same time as him.He immediately rubbed my back, using his other arm as a pillow."Devyan has a boyfriend," I confessed to him, trying uselessly to hold back the mischievous and bitchy smile formed on my face.Fred froze and looked at me with eyes widely open."Wha-""One of his teammates. He was only a bit touchy and flirty because he wanted to bother you," I interrupted him and he sighed, resting his head again and shaking it."I'm going to kill that motherfucker," he snickered, still incredulous. "And hang on, I should punish you for letting him do so, beautiful."I shook my head, amused. "Oh, no, darling, I had enough punishments and besides, it's not my fault that you didn't notice it because you were too blind by jealousy."His eyes narrowed in a mischievous way."Verity likes girls."What?I paralysed, looking at him, processing his words."Huh?""She's a lesbian. She likes women.""Are you taking the piss?"Fred giggled. "I'm not! I promise you she is. She confessed it to me once I caught her staring at...one of my friends," he completed, mysteriously."And how did I not notice then?!"Oh, Merlin, I can't believe I couldn't see one of my team even in front of my own eyes."It's not my fault that you didn't notice it because you were too blind by jealousy," he imitated me, in a cynic tone.I gave him a dim slap in his arm."Nah, you're fucking with me.""Not right now, darling."I clicked my tongue, pressing my cheek against his chest, noticing it going up and down under me."She was so nervous when she confessed it, maybe she thought I was one of those homophobic bastards but I told her that it was completely fine, obvs," Fred whispered sincerely. "She seemed still a bit nervous but I didn't want to pressure her so I let it be.""I can talk to her if you want. I'm not a lesbian but I'm a non-straight person too so maybe I can comfort her and assure her nothing will happen.""That would be great," Fred gave me a short and quick kiss."Hang on, so you knew this and still let me feel jealous about her, you prick?!" I gave him a dim punch and he complained, giggling."What can I say?" he stared into my eyes, fierce and god-like, smirking. "It's so funny to see your pretty face angry..."I clicked my tongue again and trapped his lower lip with my teeth.You bloody wanker.

After spending the next three days with my legs sore because of Fred and having to put even more effort during my training with the Harpies, I got another free day that, since Liv and Pauline were out together, was being incredibly boring. With nothing else to do, I decided to walk to the shop.While George and Verity were working down with the clients - luckily for them, it wasn't a busy day -, I went straight into Fred's office, knowing he would be there."Hello!" I got inside the room, giving a quick knock first on the door. Fred's eyes immediately raised from his papers and he gave me a kind smile."What's up, beautiful? Enjoying your free day?"I sighed, sitting in the chair in front of his desk, with my whole body still a bit achy. The windows in his office were open wide and the air was full of just-made tea smell and Fred's own scent, melting me into a pleasant state of mind. Some music I couldn't recognise fully was sounding from the cassette player, and the ginger in front of me was sitting kinda lazily while playing with a pencil on his fingers."Not so much, I'm a bit bored at home alone. Liv and Lin went out for a date and Remus is a bit busy with some shit from the Order.""Oh, boy, poor you," Fred scoffed, amused. "Well, you're actually super helpful here, y'know? I'm working on something for the store but I don't know how to make this potion work properly for the fireworks.""Oh, let me have a look," I quickly walked to stand behind his chair, bending over his shoulder to read the formula with the ingredients. Even though I no longer owned my uncle's book, I still counted on my good memory and a bit of natural talent for Potions.Fred's eyes fell on me making me notice his piercing stare, and from the corner of my eye, I saw him smirking. Before I could say a word, he separated a bit from the desk, stretching his body and leaning back, and grabbed my hips, making me sit on his lap.I scowled at him, trying to hold back the smile forming on my face. He shrugged."Thought you'd be more comfortable.""Sure you did," I snorted, going back to the potion's instructions. I slightly moved on his lap, getting more centred and putting my elbows over the desk. I heard how Fred sighed and soon, his hands were dimly caressing my back and my hips."You know you can change the dandelion root for Belladonna so the item flies more, right?""Mh-hm," Fred hummed in approval, sounding a bit distant."And if you put a bit more of Nightshade instead of snakeweed, the colours will be brighter and the powder way more explosive.""Mh-hm" his hand caressed my hip while the other one drew the path of my spine through my pullover."Are you even listening to me, Fred?"He giggled. "No, not really.""Then why did you ask for my help?" I snickered, gazing at him. He winked at me."I was listening to you but you bent over and...y'know, having such a view in front of me, I can't really concentrate on any potion, darling."I snorted, amused, shaking my head and grabbing the pencil in his fingers to correct the instructions without moving from his lap. Actually, I started to slightly move my hips while humming to the song from the cassette player, trying to seem innocent.Fred sighed again, putting his hands on my waist."You should be focused on work, Freddie," I teased him as he clicked his tongue."How can I when you come to distract me? You always manage to get all my attention," he left a kiss on my covered shoulder and then laid back again."I'm not distracting you, I'm actually doing your work," I murmured, having butterflies gathering inside my stomach."Sure you are, darling," he sarcastically whispered, squeezing my hips. Fred moved a bit of my hair, running his fingers softly through the love bites in my neck I tried to cover with makeup. They weren't noticeable unless someone looked at them detailly. "Oh, look at that, are those my marks? How pretty."I didn't reply, instead, I kept writing on his paper other formulas he might have wanted while the pencil on my fingers trembled very discreetly."How are your bruises?""They're fine.""You sure?"I nodded and I could feel him smiling behind me. His hand surrounded mine, making me leave the pencil over the papers, and then grabbed my hips to make me turn around to straddle his."Weren't we working?" I smiled at him, putting my arms around his neck, his hands travelled to my bum and squeezed it over my trousers."Time for a break.""Of course," a chuckle left my lips as Fred's intense eyes and playful smile burnt me."You know, I've been thinking about something," he started after a couple of seconds, sounding mysterious and quite mischievous. "Would you like to try something new in bed?"My eyebrows raised, surprised, as I felt my heart pounding on my chest. The fact that Fred wasn't tired of me yet made me feel a huge feeling of love and excitement all over my body, leaving a sweet flavour in my mouth."What is it?"His smile widened, devilishly."Can I put it in your ass?"I gasped, almost choking with my own saliva and a loud giggle left my mouth."Can I, Freddie?"His expression fell and he was absolutely dumbfounded."What?""Yeah, you have some interesting straps and vibrators in the erotic section down there..." I mocked him, trying to sound as serious as I could.Fred blushed and burst into laughter, pulling me closer to him."Lilith, no.""Then it's a no for you too, champion." I winked, grazing my nose with his.I enjoyed sex as fuck but anal wasn't my thing. Absolutely not.Fred shrugged, still smiling. "I had to try.""Mh-hm, but you woke up my curiosity about trying something new, though. I might have to chew on it a bit for some ideas."He rested his head against the chair, with his eyes glued to mine and his hands caressing my thighs."Good, but it'd have to be in a couple of days, I don't want to exhaust too much your pretty body and leave the Harpies without their beautiful Beater," Fred murmured in a cocky way, making me roll my eyes."Oh, pack it up. You should be worried I don't exhaust you too much and leave Georgie without his partner at the shop, more like."He snickered and broke the distance separating us to drive me into a slow but intense kiss."I'd be glad to have you exhausting me, darling.""Bet you would," I whispered, against his lips. I patted his cheek softly, standing up. "But I have to talk to Verity, remember?"Fred clicked his tongue, amused, pulling himself closer to the desk to hide the bulge in his trousers. "You little teaser.""Good to see you, though. Hope I can help you more often," I winked at him, ignoring his words and closing the door of his office behind me.That was interesting.Getting a deep breath, trying to drag my body back to normal, I found Verity, with her eyes fixed on someone on the first floor while she was trying clumsily to put a Skiving Shackbox on the shelf."Need help?" I offered, coming closer at her and giving her my kindest smile.She flinched a bit, getting out of her daydream. When she saw me, she immediately pulled a gentle smile."No, don't worry, Ms- uhm, Lilith. It's okay.""What were you looking at? If you don't mind me asking," I followed her eyes and found Liv, sharing a beer with George behind the counter.Oh, shit."She's really pretty, isn't she?" Verity whispered, like being again in her own world and not noticing I was in front of her."She's beautiful," I agreed with her. "Her name is Olivia, she's my best friend. Like a sister to me.""Oh! Uhm, sorry, I didn't know," she cleared her throat, visibly nervous."Don't worry, it's okay."Verity walked to the rail and leaned on her elbows while still staring at Liv with a dreamy smile on her face."I think I like her," she confessed and then clapped her mouth, conscient of what she just said. "Oh, Godric, I can't believe I just said that."I had to hold back my chuckle at how tender I found her."It's okay, Verity. I like girls too," when she furrowed her eyebrows, confused, I added, "And boys.""Do you think she'd like me back?" the girl whispered, a bit more comfortable, and put her eyes back to Liv.I took a deep breath and sighed. "Well, in other circumstances, I'm sure she would, but currently, she has a girlfriend.""Oh," she clicked her tongue, making her smile fade, sadly. I felt bad for her, she truly seemed to like Olivia."Yeah, I'm sorry.""Nah, it's okay. I think I've seen them together. Really gorgeous the girl. They make a good couple," she sighed, "I wish I had a girlfriend."I felt really bad at the melancholy in her voice, so I came closer to her."Listen, I know you might want to enjoy your free day far from work or anything related to it but, why don't you come this Sunday to my match and meet my teammates? They are amazing and I bet it will be a good opportunity for you to meet more people."Her eyes focused on me, bright with joy, and a huge smile filled her face showing how pretty she was."Really?""Yes!""Oh, I'd love to! Thank you so much!"✵ ✵ ✵"Wait, what? Who?" Liv asked, confused, sitting on the floor."Verity, the girl who works with Fred and George.""I thought you didn't like her," Pauline, narrowed her eyes, amused, sitting next to Liv.I shrugged, "Well, I prejudiced her and let my jealousy and my fear of Fred leaving me to take over me, but she's really nice.""So she'll be on your match? Cool, we will have to make sure we sit close to her so she doesn't feel alone," Olivia smiled, handing me a cup of tea."Yeah, it would be nice. I want her to meet the girls, y'know? I think it would be a good opportunity for her to forget her crush on Liv."Oh, fucking shit.I tightened my lips knowing how I just screwed Verity's private confession to me. Liv didn't react but I noticed how Pauline froze a bit in her place."Poor girl," Olivia pouted, giving a long sip to her cup. "She seems nice, hope she can find someone else."We kept chatting for a while but Pauline looked a bit in her own world and not talking as much as Liv and I. After an hour, more or less, Liv stood up and wrapped her robe around her body, ready to go to sleep."I'm knackered, 'm going to bed. You coming, love?" she put a hand on Lin's shoulder, but the girl shook her head, playing with her nails."No, not yet, chérie. Maybe later."Olivia nodded and after leaving a quick kiss on Lin's lips and another one on my cheek, she went straight to her room, closing the door behind her."Now," I started, focusing on Pauline, "What's going on, Lin?"She sighed, trying to think her next words."It's because of what I said about Verity having a crush on Liv? That's why you look so sad?" I approached her, softening my tone.Pauline nodded and swallowed hard. "It's just-" she struggled to find her words. "It's just that I'm scared.""Of what, darling?""Of losing Livie," she raised her gaze, staring at me with watery eyes and I felt my heart hitting the ground. I hugged her tightly."Oh, dear! You shouldn't be scared of it, Liv loves you with her entire heart!" I whispered."But what if I'm not enough? Or what if she falls in love with someone else? That Verity girl is absolutely gorgeous! Or what if she finds out she prefers to be single? Lilith, I love her too much to not be with her," she sobbed against my shoulder. "and I know she's a free soul and I love her just like that, but I can't help but be scared.""Pauline, you are stunning. Absolutely gorgeous, ethereal, whatever you want to call it, you are so incredibly beautiful too. You don't need to compare your beauty with Verity's and Liv is a free soul, yes, but she chose to be with you!"Lin tried to drown her sobs in the skin of my shoulder so Liv wouldn't hear her from her room."Listen, I'm being completely honest and I really mean it when I say I've never seen Liv so keen and so in love with someone as she is with you, and I've known her for years! I don't think anyone else but Luna and me knows Liv better and I tell you you should have seen the emotion in her face whenever she received a letter from you, how she blushed whenever she thought about you or with how much love she pronounced your name. She loves you, Pauline. She won't change you for someone else because she actually loves you. With all the meaning the word love can carry.""I'm just scared of not being enough for her," Pauline wiped off her tears while looking at me."You're more than enough, everybody can see it. Anyone would be lucky to love you, Pauline. You're not only gorgeous but also hardworking, witty, dedicated, gentle and incredibly supportive. Liv is so lucky to have you I know she won't let you go. And I don't care if she's my best friend or not, she better be treating you like the amazing woman you are or I'll be giving her a piece of my mind.""Oh, she does! That's not the problem at all. Livie treats me much better than any of my previous girlfriends. Being with her feels just like a dream and that's why I'm also scared, I don't want to wake up from it," she ran her hands through her face, sighing. "Mon Dieu, I'm such an idiot.""You aren't! Everyone has insecurities, Lin, it's normal. I have them, Liv has them, all of us do. And believe me when I tell you I haven't seen a more beautiful relationship than yours, but if you do want to keep leaving in that dream and keep a healthy bond, you two need to sit down and talk about your insecurities and how to make you two stronger.""You think she would want to?" Pauline asked, a bit doubtful."Of course! Anything for you and to make your relationship even better. She's gonna be a bloody psychologist! Who better to understand emotions and find a healthy bond for you two?"Pauline smiled softly and grabbed my hands in between hers."Thank you, Lilith."I clicked my tongue, dragging her back to my body to hug her. "There's nothing to thank me for, dear. I'm your friend and I love you, I only want the best for you.""You really think Livie and I make a good couple?" she whispered, slightly amused."I genuinely do, everyone does, even Verity said it. You two are meant for each other."Lin relaxed her body, more comfortable, and after caressing my hand, she stood up and left a kiss on my cheek to then walk to Liv's room."I love you so much too, Lilith," she said before opening the dorm's room, and whisper. "Livie, you up?"I stayed there for a bit longer, thinking about Lin's words. I felt the same way about Fred but in a more wicked and twisted way. I loved him, with my entire heart and soul; I loved him in such a deep and intense way that burnt me and consumed me in the most beautiful way possible, I had him deep-rooted in my heart and deeply buried in my head. He was my Freddie.Merlin, how badly I wished 

 love

 me back, how madly I wanted to be in his system as deep as he was in mine...But he wasn't for me. And even though my feelings for him did nothing more but grow and grow, I knew he would end up leaving me. Because, on the contrary to Pauline's situation, I actually wasn't enough. I convinced myself it didn't matter. And it truly didn't.I didn't care if he didn't love me back, I didn't care if he was going to find true love in someone else even though the only thought of it made me physically and mentally sick. I could only be thankful for having earned a place in his life as a friend, which I was definitely going to keep.Even though I wasn't the source of his happiness, all I wanted was for him to be the happiest man on Earth, to keep shining as full of light as he was now and for me to be near him to see it. Even if it was in the distance with the name of 'friend'.I loved him so much I only wanted him to be happy.

As days kept going on, I started to get more involved inside the Order. England's ambience was greyer than ever and even in the lonely Diagon Alley — where stores started to close and the only scrap of cheer seemed to be Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes — whispers about sightings of the Death Eaters could be heard. Remus warned all of us to be extremely careful and to reinforce the security measurements, and privately informed me about the situation with the Death Eaters attempting to enter Hogwarts and everything he knew about my uncle and Draco. I tried more than once to communicate with Malfoy, but all our words were pretty trivial and nothing as close as before, even though I still loved him as a little brother, his attempt to protect me was only distancing us.Because of the increasing danger, Liv and Pauline decided to stay at home during most of these days, out of the muggle world, and they used this precious time together to resolve their problems and chat on how to make their relationship healthier.My nineteenth birthday arrived on a cold and windy Monday. I woke up earlier than everyone else and, still wearing only the shirt Fred left in my room - with his smell still present - and my underwear, I drank a cup of coffee and had a cigarette sitting on the window before going to my training with the Harpies. I put on the cassette player and soon, Where is My Mind by the Pixies filled the silence. With the first notes still sounding, a familiar ginger head appeared in the other flat and those brown eyes that had me so captivated met mine, making me melt."Good morning, beautiful," Fred came closer to me, covering me from up to down, as usual, murmuring with his raspy sleepy voice that sent quivers all over my body. "Nice shirt," he winked at me, "Nineteens suit you good."I couldn't help but smile. "Morning, Freddie.""Any plans for today? Liv said you don't want a big party. Why is that?"My smile almost faded but I managed to keep it thanks to Fred's warm stare. "I have Quidditch practise today and I'm not feeling in the mood for a big party, sharing a couple of pints with friends is more than enough. At least this chaotic year.""Well, I respect your choice for today but the party is still pending, though. Once you get out of the training, come to the Leaky Cauldron. Georgie, Liv, Lin and I already reserved the biggest table there."The fact that he was taking the time to make my birthday a good day was already the best gift I could expect."Thank you, Freddie," I said in a soft voice, being interrupted by little Iris landing in front of me with a couple of letters tied to her tiny leg. The ginger clicked his tongue, blithe."Nothing to thank for, darling."My smile widened as I read the names of the people who sent the letters; Draco, Tonks, Remus, Luna, Hermione, Harry, Nev, Ginny, my uncle - first direct news I had from him since June - and, surprisingly, Devyan too, along with a letter signed by all the Harpies.I put them aside while focusing again on Fred, who was scanning me curiously and piercingly with that wild smile on his face."Mum wants me and George tonight at the Burrow and since later you and I are gonna be busy with the rest...I thought we could have a little bit of preliminary fun if you want."He raised his eyebrows and smirked, making every part of my skin burn.I took a deep breath and stood down from the window. Turning around, I grabbed my shirt and pulled it off, feeling the cold hugging my body as I looked at Fred from above my shoulder.His eyes slid by every inch of my exposed skin, craving and longing, as his knuckles became white at the grip of his window."Come here, Freddie," I purred, starting to walk, really slowly, to my room in front of the ginger. "Show me that preliminary fun."Fred snarled in approval and managed to pass from his flat to mine in less than a minute, covering the distance separating us and making me melt at his touch immediately as he guided me back to my room.What a wonderful way to start my birthday.✵ ✵ ✵After separating from Fred and with my legs still trembling from the three rounds he had put me through, I flew straight to the Quidditch field, pleased and in the best mood I had been in a while. My teammates received me between whoops and greetings and after an enjoyable training, we stayed chatting over the fresh grass.We changed our clothes back into the normal ones and went all together straight to Diagon Alley, where Liv received us at the Leaky Cauldron's door."HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LILITH!" George jumped into me, hugging me strongly and spinning me around, making me laugh. "Hello, ladies!" he welcomed the girls behind me while putting me back to the floor and passing his arm around a smiley Angelina."S'up, mate!" Aileen high-fived him and entered the first inside the pub.Everyone gathered around me, warming up my heart and making me feel more loved than ever before. They were all getting along pretty well and while Khaleelah was comfortably chatting with Liv and Pauline, Aileen got really well with Tonks and the rest were fascinated by Angelina's Quidditch stories while George hyped her up."So your name's Remus Lupin, sir?" Aileen asked, already a bit hammered, while smiling at Remus like a little kid."Yes, dear," the man smiled at her, finding the McDonald girl pretty amusing. "Why?""Oh, 's nothing. Just that my mum told me about a friend of hers who had the same name," she replied casually, "She has a lot of famous friends, y'know? Told me she even met John-and-a-half a few years ago.""The famous magizoologist?! That man worked with Newt Scamander, didn't he?" Tonks asked, genuinely surprised."Aye!""What's your mother's name, dear?" Remus focused on Aileen, looking at her curiously."Mary McDonald, sir. She went to Hogwarts in the 70s. Sorted in Gryffindor. I carry her last name because she didn't think it was fair to give me my dad's after the bad time she went through during pregnancy."I noticed how Lupin paled, swallowing hard as a huge nostalgic smile covered his face."Mary? Oh, Godric, of course I remember her, we were great friends at school. Merlin...wish I could see her one last time," he murmured, tightening his lips without erasing his smile. "Once you see her, please, tell her I sent her my biggest hug and that I would love to meet her one of these days, I have missed her lots."Tonks served us the pints and pumpkin juice for those who didn't want alcohol, while Fred slid in the seat by my side putting his hand on my thigh. While George and Liv were making Pauline and Angie laugh with Merlin knows what story, Remus gave three little taps to the cup, gaining our attention."Today, nineteen years ago, one of the most beautiful souls and strongest girls I ever met was born. Lilith, daughter," he turned around to look at me with his soft eyes and paternal smile. "I can't be grateful enough for having you in my life. You make me incredibly proud every day that goes by and, even though we don't share actual blood, you are one of the best gifts life has given me. I love you so much, dear, and I hope I can keep seeing you age like the wonderful woman you are becoming."I felt the tears grouping in my eyes as I ran into Remus's arms to hug him tightly and breathe his scent that felt so calming and protective to me."Thank you so much, Remus," I whispered feeling him caressing my hair. "You can't imagine how much I love you.""Happy birthday, sister," Liv raised her butterbeer, grinning. "I wish I knew how to say words so beautiful like Remus's but I can only say how much I love you and how thankful I am for having you."I moved to her arms and thank her too whispering, feeling the familiar and comforting feeling of hugging Liv. Then, all of my friends gave me an individual hug and proceeded to keep with the good and entertaining ambience we had. A party would have been good, yes, but I couldn't feel more grateful for having friends like mine and being able to share my birthday with them."CHEERS FOR THE GREATEST BITCH TO SET A FOOT ON THIS PLANET!" Tonks whooped, already a bit drunk while putting her arm around my shoulder. "LILITH, BABE, YOU BETTER ENJOY YOUR NINETEENS PROPERLY! FRED, MATE, IF YOU DON'T FUCK HER AS SHE DESERVES I'LL HUNT YOU, DO YOU HEAR ME?"All of us burst laughing and Fred managed to nod, lifting his hands as a sign of surrender.While we kept drinking, my friends gave me their presents, making me almost tear up with pure excitement and affection. Every single one of them made me fond but Fred's... Oh, Merlin, Fred's present made me want to jump into his arms and kiss him. My eyes sorted from the incredibly new and unpolluted broom in my hands, the best brand in the Wizarding World, to Fred's proud smile and shining brown eyes. It had two papers tied to the black wood; a letter and what seemed to be a picture.My gaze found first the letter, written in his messy handwriting that gave me goosebumps all over my skin;A beautiful broom for the most beautiful Harpie.

P.S: We are the best partners in crime, aren't we, darling? ;)

The picture made my heart fall straight to the floor and I wanted to literally stand up and shout to the entire world how in love I was with Fred. I wanted to hug that picture, to press it against my chest and to treasure it as if it was gold itself.It was the two of us, in Fred's office at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. He was sitting in his chair while I was sat over the table, we both were looking at each other while laughing cheerfully. I couldn't help but appreciate the obvious stare of pure love in my eyes as I observed him. We both tilted our heads back in the picture, at the same time, laughing at Merlin knows what.We looked accomplice, friendly, united and...happy. Genuinely happy.I looked at the back of the picture and read the words written in it;

Lilith and Fred, Summer 1996.

The picture was taken by the hottest Weasley to ever exist; Georgie.

My smile widened and I stood up to look at Fred, whose eyes stayed on me firmly and warmingly. Dithering at first, I walked slowly towards him and plucked up the courage to hug him tightly. His arms quickly wrapped me, letting me feel that touch of him that I so desperately needed, feeling happy to have his scent covering me from up to down."Thank you so much, Freddie," I whispered. I love you, I wanted to add.I heard him chuckling and his hand stroke my back."You're welcome, darling."That was, by far, one of the best birthdays in my life — it would have been the best if Hermione, Draco, Nev and Harry had been here too — and I felt I could never be thankful enough for it.I was happy. So happy that during the rest of the month, even though everything seemed to keep as dark as the previous days, nothing could erase the dreamy smile on my face nor stop me from looking at my picture with Fred every day, at every moment I was in my room.I was so incredibly and madly happy, that for the first time since I had memory, Ares's birthday wasn't as bad as it used to be.And that relieved my soul in the sweetest way I ever felt.

Two weeks after my birthday, after intense training with the team, I went straight to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.I didn't know if it was the fact that both Fred and I had been incredibly busy these last days or if it was that my period was meant to arrive this week to end November but I felt hornier than ever. I needed Fred's attention.Waving at George and Verity - who had an immense smile on her face since she met the gorgeous Aileen at my last match -, I knocked in Fred's office and quickly entered inside. The ginger was fully concentrated in some papers in front of him, his eyebrows frowned and his jawline clenched.I looked at him a bit puzzled, while sitting in front of his desk. "Morning, darling.""Morning," Fred replied drily, without lifting his eyes from the papers and moving the pencil in his hand nervously."Is everything okay?""Yes," he spat, obvious. "It's just that George always carries me with all the math work and I fucking hate it."My eyes covered the way the veins in his arms popped off when he pulled his sleeves up and ran his hand over his hair. My blood felt boiling in my body and I couldn't help but rub my thighs together wanting some friction."I thought we could spend time together later if you want," I continued, controlling my soft tone to see if I could make him talk to me more gently. "Khaleelah made us train hard today and I would love to take a relaxing bath with you."Fred didn't say a word, instead, he kept writing clicking his tongue. I scowled, trying to hide the rage that started to blossom under my skin. This little fucker...."Devyan gave me a little back massage but I'm still aching a bit," I hissed, slowly with a bitchy smile on my face when the ginger glared at me the moment I mentioned Khan. "His hands felt amazing, though."He leaned momentary back on his chair and raised his chin arrogantly."I'd love it if you don't mention his name in my presence, Lilith."The devilish part of my mind made me chuckle, "Why not, Freddie? I thought we already had clarified the Devyan situation.""I still don't like him," Fred quickly replied, going back to his papers."At least he doesn't behave like a wanker," I whispered thinking he didn't hear me, crossing my arms in front of my chest.Maybe coming to see him wasn't that good idea after all. Fred's eyes burnt me in a way that froze me in my seat but I didn't change my deadpan expression."If your dear Devyan was that great and awesome you wouldn't be here telling me to bath with you," he drawled, imitating my voice when he mentioned Khan. "Why don't you stay here nice and silent until I finish my work, angel? Don't make me madder than I already am.""Excuse me?""You heard me." An arrogant smirk covered his face. "Be a good girl and obey me."I stood up and caught his face in between my hand, digging my nails in his cheeks and getting in a war of looks in which his wild stare tried to soothe mine."If you want a fucking submissive who obeys every single thing you order them then go fuck one of the shy birds you used to shag in the past. I'm not your fucking whore."Fred's smile grew as his eyebrows arched. Fuck, I couldn't deny he was turning me on. Bloody hormones and bloody you, Weasley."This is why you are the best one I ever had," he murmured. I clicked my tongue and separated from him."Fuck off, Weasley," I muttered, walking to the door, ready to leave. I don't care about him, I'll wank in the shower if I have to. I don't need him. But when my hand touched the knob, I saw the sparkles coming from Fred's wand locking the door. I glared at him, crossing my arms."Let me go.""Uhmm," he pretended to think, making my blood boil even more. "How about not?""I have better things to do than dealing with your fucking attitude, Frederick."Fred hissed, cheerful. "Don't be mad, love. C'mon, sit down again.""What for? For you to behave like a bloody dickhead with me. No, thanks. Let me go." I spat, ready to take my wand. I complained when I noticed I wasn't carrying it. Probably left it at home. How fucking irresponsible of me. I swallowed hard at the next words that left my mouth, praying on the inside for him to deny them; "Besides, if you're already tired of me, just say it. Don't need to be such a prick."Fred giggled, tilting his head back. "Tired of you? Oh, Lilith, if you could only read my thoughts right now..."I sighed and his eyes pierced me."Weren't you the one wanting to bathe with me? Wait here, darling. Let me finish my work and we will spend all the time together you want," he softened his voice but I didn't change my expression.I sat back again, crossing my arms in front of my chest and avoiding looking at Fred. I was fucking pissed off.After a couple of minutes in silence in which the rage in my body only grew and made me want to tie up Fred again and edge him until he begged for my forgiveness and for me to fuck him, I snorted;"If you aren't going to give me attention, you should let me go look for it somewhere else."Fred's eyes met mine briefly and then went back to the parchment in front of him where he was writing. A little smile appeared at the corners of his lips."We both know mine is the only attention you want, Lilith. And mine is the one you'll be getting if you patiently wait, angel.""I'm horny now, Fred. I haven't fucked in two weeks.""Then let me work and I'll remedy those two weeks without sex."I clicked my tongue, annoyed, rubbing my thighs harder and Fred's eyes focused on my legs. He snickered when he noticed what I was doing."What's wrong, darling? Are you so needy and desperate that you can't wait for me without teasing yourself?" he scoffed with his deep voice, drawling and sending quivers straight to my clit."Shut up." I teased him, giving him the Slytherin look. With a feline smirk, and making the words slide out of my mouth as poured venom." We both know you are dying to fuck me too, daddy."His eyes opened widely and his breathing became deeper."What did you just called me?""Daddy." I drawled, savouring the word in my mouth."Call me daddy again, Lilith, and I'll make you cum so many times you'll cry.""You wished."He snickered again, slowing, even more, the movement of his hands as he kept writing. The bloody fucker was doing it on purpose to exasperate me more.You're playing with the wrong bitch.I stood up from my chair and knowing damn well that I could force the door to open it with a simple kick, I decided to play with Fred. Teach him once and for fucking all not to play with meStrolling by his office, I stood up in front of the chest of drawers he had next to his desk. I started opening, curious, the drawers and I found the one where he kept the first tester of every product they were creating and working on but that didn't have a name yet. I couldn't help but smile when I saw the big burgundy vibrator carefully packed. It looked like a normal 11-inch dildo but I knew Fred adapted it to be a vibrator too and he had told me how it was designed to take the shape the person who bought it wanted.I walked back to the seat, taking the vibrator out of its box and calling Fred's attention at the same time."What're you doing?" he asked, opening his eyes widely."Well...if you don't give me the attention I need, I have to do something about it, haven't I?" I drawled, running the tip of my index and my nail through the burgundy plastic. "I really need to cum, Freddie."The ginger clicked his tongue, shaking his head and going back to writing. "You're being a bloody brat.""Yes, and this thing right here is going to recompense me for it," I murmured, putting it over the chair, sticking the gloppy bottom to the leather, and kneeling in front of it."Bah," Fred scoffed, "you won't dare."I looked at him, arching my eyebrows."Oh, really?" I whispered, grabbing the vibrator to then run my lips and my tongue through it, lubricating it for me. Fred's eyes pierced me and burnt me as he made tighter the grip on his pencil.Once the plastic was covered in my saliva, I stood up and lift my skirt, with my back towards him so he could see every movement I made. I pulled down my underwear, pressed the tiny button that turned on the vibrations, and straddled the chair feeling the tip of the device already teasing my entrance."What were you saying, Freddie?" I murmured, staring at him from above my shoulder and giving him a feeling smile, trying to control the moan that threatened to leave my lips because of the little vibrations against my skin."Don't you dare Lilith," Fred warned me in a deeper voice, squeezing the pencil so much I thought he was going to break it."Watch me," I spat in a whisper, I put my hands over the back of the chair and moved my hips down, making the vibrator enter inside of me in a slow thrust. Fuck, it felt bigger than I expected.The moan I tried to hold left my mouth and I closed my eyes at the intense and deep sensation of the vibrations, feeling my own juices warming the toy and my walls wrapping around it. I kept going down, trying to fit as much as I could, moaning louder when I felt the tip rubbing my weak spot."Mmh, Freddie..."I moaned, hissing and starting to slowly ride the vibrator, letting Fred see how it got in and out of me."You fucking needy slut," he snarled, to then lick his lips and try to keep working. "Go get fucked by that stupid vibrator, I don't care."I snickered, feeling how my skin got goosebumps when I pushed my hips down rougher."Wasn't this how you liked me? Being your perfect little whore?" I managed to say, struggling to find my voice as the pressure in between my legs felt deliciously unbearable. I couldn't help but drive my hand to my achy clit and start drawing circles in it, imagining it was Fred's hands the ones touching me. "Fuck!"I felt the familiar knot forming in my guts and I rode the vibrator faster, making my hips jump over it, moving them in circles so it could touch every single angle inside of me and feeling the wetness sliding down the burgundy material."Oh, no, this is the last straw. I draw the motherfucking line here." I heard Fred in the distance behind me because of the dizziness in my head and my whole body focused on making me cum.A strong hand gripped my wrist to pull my hand off my clit and I felt Fred's other hand sneaking below my bum to grab the vibrator inside of me as his body glued to my back, letting me feel his deep breath behind me."You have two options, beautiful," he whispered in my ear, pressing his hand in my neck as he pushed the vibrator more into me, making me whimper. "You cum around this stupid piece of plastic...or you behave like a good girl and you let me fuck you properly."Fred's hand put more pressure on my neck as his other hand slid to my throbbing clit to caress it, I whined when I felt his erection grinding against my bum, overwhelmed."Fuu-uuck!" I groaned, choking with my own breathing when his finger moved even faster and the vibrator hit again my weakest spot."What do you choose, Lilith?" he bit slowly and softly my earlobe, making me tilt my head back and resting it over his shoulder."Y-you! You, Freddie, I choose you." I cried out, putting my hand on his cheek to guide his lip to mine. "That's my good girl," he proudly whispered, moving my hair aside to have full access to my neck and my face. His hands abandoned me, much to my dismay, to unbutton his trousers. He slapped my bum harshly and then I felt how his hand gripped the bottom of the vibrator, pulling it out of me right away. "I'm going to fuck the brat out of you, darling. And we'll later talk about that 'daddy' thing."I whimpered at the empty feeling but I didn't have time to put into words my complaint because Fred grabbed my hips and slammed himself into me in a hard thrust. I moaned out loud at the warm feeling of his skin against mine when he immediately started to pound. His hands dug in my hips and I heard him groaning raspy."My beautiful slut...So wet and perfect for me."His hands sneaked below my shirt to cup my breast as his mouth bit and sucked the exposed skin of my neck. I tilted my head back, letting him please me as only he knew. "Freddie...""Feel so fucking good, love, so good wrapped around me."Fucking hell, Fred. You're gonna end me."Does that fucking vibrator feel better than me, darling?"I shook my head, unable to form any word while he kept pounding hard into me, forming a bewitching melody with the sound of his skin against mine. He pressed more my neck and grazed his lips against my cheek, roughing his path inside of me;"Use your words, Lilith. Does it feel better?" he repeated the question. I whimpered at the delicious feeling of one of his hands staying in my neck and the other one squeezing harshly my hip as he fucked me. Shit, this was exactly what I needed."No - You better. Much better." I struggled to say, interrupted by my own whine. I clenched around Fred and he moaned raspy, rocking his hips faster and rougher as he bit softly the skin of my collarbone."Aha, because nobody fucks this perfect pussy like daddy does, right, angel?" he scoffed, to then move my face to look at him and slam his lips against mine, swallowing my moans."My perfect little whore...""Oh, Freddie!" I moaned when he kept kissing my jaw, going rough inside of me, rubbing my weak spot and letting me feel him throbbing and pulsating against my walls at the growing tension between the two of us."And you had the nerve to ask me if I was already tired of you...as if you hadn't me completely bewitched and wrapped around your finger."My Freddie...The knot in my guts formed again, sending goosebumps all over my body and making me almost see the stars when he made me bent more over the back of the chair and pulled my hair to pound rougher inside of me, digging his fingers in my bruised hips and making my soaked inner thighs and pulsating inside tremble."Right there, Freddie," I murmured, glueing my back to his chest, and pulling his hair so he could go back to kiss my jaw and my neck. Fred snarled, aroused, and hissed full of pleasure. "That's my good boy, make me cum, darling."He whimpered, closing his eyes harshly when I clenched around him, feeling my orgasm approaching.The goosebumps covered my skin and the quivers travelled all over my body when I felt myself arriving at the edge, as Fred lifted my shirt to kiss and bite the now exposed skin of my back, while he kept thrusting hard and rough into me. My climax hit me hard when his hands went back to my neck and my overstimulated clit, making every nerve in my body explode in pure and raw pleasure, with the stars and fireworks in my eyes as a loud moan and whimper with his name rasped my throat."Oh, darling," he murmured with his deep and out of breath voice. "Love it so fucking much when you moan my name. Coming and making a mess just for me. That's my good girl."Still affected by my orgasm and feeling at the peak of the rollercoaster, I tightened myself around him again and he rocked his hips faster, feeling his own climax approaching.Fred's hand moved to wrap around my waist, and biting the exposed skin of my back as his other hand squeezed my hip, he let out a loud and raspy whimper as he came inside of me, fusing our orgasms into one."Fuuuck!" he let out, struggling to find his own voice and pressing his forehead in my back. "My Lilith..."Trying to get back his breath, Fred pulled out of me and I turned around to let myself fall over the chair, absolutely exhausted and pleasedly aching."That was good," I spluttered, with the air struggling to fill my lungs again."You're happy now?" he smiled, putting his trousers correctly and leaning back on his desk in front of me, catching my face in between his hands to leave a quick kiss on my lips."I am. You?""Really happy, darling," Fred's smile widened. "So happy that work can fuck off. I only want to drag you to my place and take that bath with you."I giggled, feeling the blood concentrating in my face, but before I could say a word, Fred caught my hand into his, making me stand up. Giving me one of his piercing stares and wild smirks, he made us disappear and appear again in front of his flat's door. Noticing my legs were weak and still a bit trembly, he made me jump to his back and carried me inside his place, straight to the bathroom. Letting me rest sitting over the sink, he started to prepare the water for the bath, putting bubbles, scents and lightening some candles I didn't know he had. Once the water was ready with the steam and flowery smell coming out of it, Fred turned around to look at me with a sweet smile."Accio cassette player."The device came flying and positioned over the bidet's water tap. Fred pulsed the button and the first notes of Wonderwall started filling the ambience.My heart shrank in my chest in the most beautiful way possible and I felt the butterflies in my stomach going crazy. Fred quickly got rid of all of his clothes and then approached me to slowly get rid of mine, making sure he wasn't hurting me. He took a bit of advantage of my nudity to caress and appreciate the marks that were already appearing in my skin."Next time we fuck you're going to be the one marked," I warned him, unable to hide the smile on my face. He grinned, shrugging."Much to my pleasure then."I bit my lower lip observing the beautiful shiny sparkles that appeared in his chocolate eyes."C'mere, darling," he whispered with a smile, grabbing my waist and helping me to walk to the bath. Before getting inside, he tied my hair in a bun and then proceeded to enter first so he could help me enter too, sitting with my back glued to his chest.The hot water felt delicious and I couldn't help but close my eyes, completely relaxed at the smell of the flowery scents and Fred's own one, added to a particular one I loved;"Jasmine flower smell?" I asked him in a little whisper. He nodded, wrapping his arms around my waist to pull me even closer to him. We stayed there silent for a couple of minutes, eyes closed, skin against skin, feeling each other and cuddling with Wonderwall in the background."Thanks, Lilith," he suddenly whispered, leaving short and soft kisses all over my collarbones and my neck."For what?""For having so much patience with me."I couldn't help but chuckle. "Don't thank me for that, Freddie, you deal with me a lot too. We're even.""Yeah, but to be fair, it's not like I don't enjoy seeing your pretty face get angry." He snickered too and wrapped his arms tightly around my waist to then start spreading kisses and little bites all over my cheeks, making me laugh between his arms.Oh, my Freddie, if you only knew how much I adore you.

December arrived with a huge grey cloud over London; the cold could be felt in every corner of the city, the Wizarding World was more and more concerned and alerted at the Death Eaters' next movement and even the muggles felt drained of any energy. I occupied my days training hard with the Harpies, doing my best during the matches and trying to spend as much time with Fred as our tight schedules allowed us. My feelings for him did nothing more than grow and grow during those days, unexpected, right?Before I could make any plan for Christmas - maybe going with Liv and Pauline to the Lovegood's house in the middle of rural Ireland - a letter from Mrs Weasley arrived at my house a week before, surprising me."Is your mother-in-law calling you?" Pauline winked at me, handing me the letter from the Weasley family's old owl.I scowled, confused, but still smiled at her. "You sure it's for me? Maybe the owl mistook our address with the twins'.""Nah, chérie, it says your name. There's no other Lilith."I opened it carefully and read the note; it was the invitation to spend Christmas at the Burrow with Hermione, Harry, Remus, Tonks and the rest of the Weasleys. With him."You should go," Liv quickly said, reading the letter from above my shoulder."You don't mind?""Of course not! We'll visit you anyway."When I was about to reply, a whistle behind me called our attention. Both Fred and George were poking out their kitchen window with big smiles on their faces."Ladies! Morning!" Fred talked first."Lilith, please, tell me you're coming to the Burrow with us. I don't think I can bear with this dickhead alone," George continued, looking at me while pointing out at his twin.Fred nudged him and I grinned;"Sure, Georgie. I'll be there for you.""Take that, you idiot!" he mocked at Fred, whose eyes kept on mine with a soft and at the same time mischievous bright."I'm still her favourite twin, you wanker. Aren't I, Lilith?"I stared at his messy ginger hair, looking like eager and consuming fire in contrast with his snow-white skin and those eyes looking like melted bronze that hunted me so deeply.How could you not be, Freddie? If I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new."I'm not answering that," I snickered, "You fuck me but Georgie brings me chocolate at the Quidditch field, that gains points.""HA!" George burst, amused. "Told you, Freddie. Can't compete with me."✵ ✵ ✵The night before going to the Burrow, with all my luggage ready for the two weeks I was planning to stay there, I went to bed with a sour flavour in my mouth. For some reason, I couldn't help but keep remembering my nightmares even though I hadn't had them in a good couple of weeks thanks to how exhausted I arrived at home after work. After coming out of the shower, Liv noticed my uncomfortableness and offered herself to sleep with me in case I needed it, but I didn't want to bother her more than I already did so I managed to force a smile - that I'm sure she didn't fully believe - and go straight to my bed, hoping not to dream anything.But it didn't work.As soon as my head rested over the pillow, the scenario in my head started to ramble through the most absolute darkness of my mind.I was in the Arambella House, for the first time in years, the scenario wasn't the empty, cold and grey walls of Azkaban. The woody walls covered in ripped portraits of the noble Arambella family were dusty and spotted with dry blood. The coldness pierced my body, gripping my bones as I walked through the dark corridors to what it used to be before the living room.

She was there. As she always was.

"Lili, baby," Circe murmured with her snake-like sharp voice, looking at me with her black dark eyes. She wasn't wearing the attire she was obligated to wear at Azkaban, instead, her lanky and skeletal figure was hugged by an expensive black dress. The same one she was using the day she was caught.

I rolled my eyes, already fed up with her.

"Can't you leave me a single fucking dream alone, mother?"

She arched one of her eyebrows and the corners of her lips twisted in a malevolous smirk.

"Oh, you pretentious girl," she tutted, approaching me. The sunlight entered through the enormous window, making the shadows in her bony face sharper, giving her a deadly look. "Thought I had taught you some manners. What way of greeting mommy is that?"

"You don't deserve anything from me, Circe."

"No, Lili. You are the one who doesn't deserve anything from me," she murmured with her calm tone, standing right in front of me. "But you're my daughter after all, and what kind of mom would I be if I didn't try with all my strength to bring you back to me?"

"We already had this conversation, mother," I crossed my arms in front of my chest, looking away from her and trying to stay firm. "I'm not joining you, no matter what you do. The only place where I'd be going with you is to Hell."

"I have done everything for you. I sacrifice myself for you. I became a criminal for you."

"For me? How dare you, you fucking selfish bitch? You became the criminal you are today because of your thirst for revenge against Ares. Not for me."

Her face became more dismal when she heard my father's name and I could have sworn she had her eyes watered.

"Don't mention his name in my presence, Lili," she remained calm, but I knew her, she was swallowing her own pain. "I did what I did because I didn't want you to be like me. I joined the fool of Riddle because even though his blood is polluted too, he was the only one who offered me a good future for you, away from the mudbloods and the muggles, and the only one who gave me the possibility to revenge myself from that homewrecker."

"You've found him?" I asked, feeling the sorrow drive through my veins.

"No, Lili, but I will. I promise you I will," she smirked again. "But you, oh, my baby, your blood was polluted too, too much for me to save you. I should have known the moment I saw your green eyes looking just like his. I tried to, Merlin knows I tried to make you the perfect weapon for the Dark Lord, to make you my revengeful angel...and I would have made it if the stupid Order of the Phoenix and the pollution in your blood hadn't stopped me."

"If I'm polluted then so are you. Have you forgotten you are a Halfblood too, Circe?"

She tilted her head to the right as if she couldn't believe what I was telling her.

"I know, but unlike you, I am purifying myself by joining the Dark Lord and repenting from my mistakes. You're so quick to detach yourself from me, Lili, but we aren't so different after all. I fell in love with a muggle but you were even worse," she giggled, swallowing hard at the memory of my father. "You fell in love with a blood traitor. How low of you, baby."

"Shut up, his mere name is way out of your league."

"Whatever you say, Lili. But you know I'm right. And you know exactly what would happen. He will tell you he loves you back - how couldn't he when you are such a doll with such an angel face? -, he will promise you the entire world, he will raise your hopes to the stars..." Circe whispered, with a soft voice and her stare lost. "and when you think you can't feel higher, you can't be more in love with him and you can barely breathe without him... that's when he will leave you. They always do. It's in their nature."

"That's not true," I managed to say, even though her words were cutting me below my skin forming a big knot in my throat. I knew I wasn't enough for Fred. I knew he deserved someone better.

"Isn't it, Lili? Haven't all the men in your life abandoned you? The despicable roguish of your father, my own brother leaving you every year at the care of those elves, barely visiting you and barely taking care of you, your dear Cedric, even the Malfoy boy... what do you expect from that blood traitor?"

"Don't even dare to mention Cedric," I mumbled, full of rage. "Your dearest Dark Lord was the one who took him from me. And don't you dare to name Draco either. If he left me is because he is protecting me precisely from you, you bitch."

She chuckled evilly again. "However you're going to call it. They left you, just like they did with me. The Dark Lord is the only one who stays. He is the only right answer."

I tried to force myself to wake up, but it was useless. I kept seeing her in front of me.

A grey mist started to surround us and a heavy storm could be heard from outside. The strong wind hit the opened windows covering both her and me till the core. She didn't flinch.

"If you don't believe me, Lili. If you still think he is going to love you. If you still think for the tiniest moment that he won't leave you at the first opportunity, then look by yourself."

She opened solemnly her arm, pointing at where on one of the fancy chairs from the dining table was Fred sat. But he wasn't alone. Her tanned legs swung at every side of his hips while his hands were tightly gripped on hers. Her arms were around his neck while she glued her chest to his and their lips moved against each other eagerly and passionately. I heard him moan and my heart fell to the floor into millions of pieces.

My Freddie...

"You see, Lili? This is what is going to happen, sooner or later. That filthy blood traitor and her disgusting Plums mudblood have more things in common than you could imagine, and if he doesn't leave you for her, he will leave for any other."

"Freddie..." I felt the knot becoming tighter in my throat and I could feel myself drowning in sadness.

His lips separated from hers to look at me, both of them with mockery and the arrogance in their eyes. "I'm sorry, Lilith. I tried to love you, I promise you I did. But you weren't enough, darling."

I swallowed my own tears not allowing myself to cry in front of them.

"You're manipulating me, Circe. Fred doesn't like Sienna."

My mother smiled again and the whole scenario changed once more. Showing us at the door of the Arambella mansion, with an older version of myself in front of us, a little girl in my arms, 2 or 3 years old - with big green eyes and soft ginger curls, beautiful, the most beautiful baby I have ever seen - and an older Fred walking through the door.

"Fine, Lili. Imagine for a moment that this is your life, that he really and actually loves you and you two end up together like the happy and stupid traitor family you want to have with him," Circe started, walking by my side to show me the scene. Fred was looking almost like he did nowadays, but the wrinkles were starting to show in his skin and the boredom and dullness in his eyes were impossible to hide. "Are you so stupid not to know that he would do exactly what your father did?"

Fred walked through the door forcing a little smile that ended up looking more like a thin line on his lips as my older version waved at him while the baby girl in my arms rested her head in my shoulder.

The next scene was that same older version of me crying, kneeled at the centre of the living room, shouting Fred's name as the same baby looked at me from behind the door with fear in her little puppy eyes.

"No," I refused with a trembly voice, walking backwards, trying to distance myself from the scene. "No, no. That's not going to happen."

The scene changed one last time and my memory of seeing Ares leaving home, with the last look he gave me, filled the place. I felt my whole body numb and Circe held her breath by my side.

"I know you hate me, Lili," she murmured, unable to keep her eyes away from Ares. "And you are in your full right to do so. I never loved you enough and never will. But it doesn't matter how much you try to cut off our bond, how much you try to erase the part of me living inside of you or how much you try not to be like me. We will always be connected. You're mine, Lili, you're condemned to repeat my story."

"No."

"And it doesn't matter how much you try to hide from me. I will find you."

"I said no!"

"You can't escape from me, Lili.""NO!" a strong shout rasped my throat as I woke up, followed by the memory of my nightmare making me burst into tears. "No, no, no! Please, leave me alone!""Darling..." I heard Fred's voice from between my sobs. Still thinking I was in a dream, or a nightmare more like, he sat in front of me and caught my hands between his. "Lilith, is this what happens when you have a nightmare?"I tried to wipe out my tears because I hated being so weak in front of him. Unable to form a word, I nodded, feeling completely embarrassed that he had seen me going through one of my nightmares.Fred clicked his tongue and passed his hands around my waist to pull me closer to him and hug me tightly, letting me feel his scent and his warm touch. "Oh, angel...I'm so sorry."The softness in his tone made me sob even harder, he was being there for me, consoling me and holding the broken pieces of me between his arms...and I couldn't forget my mother's words echoing in the back of my mind."What 're you doing here?" I asked, moving from his hug, already missing the warmth coming from his chest. He looked at me worried, as if I was a bomb about to explode, and kept caressing my hands."I came to take you with me to the Burrow. Liv told me you were still asleep so I offered to wake you up.""Oh, sorry, did I make you wait for too long?" I stood up from bed, trying to put distance over us but keeping my soft tone.I am not enough for him. He is full of light, I don't want to be the darkness that turns off that light. I am not enough for him."No, it's okay," he said softly, observing how I changed my clothes. "Darling, can I make you a question?""Go on," I said, not completely sure."What was the nightmare about?"I sighed. I could still feel the cold in my bones."About her. It's always about her." I murmured, looking at my feet. If I looked again at his worried eyes I would burst into tears again. "Let's go. I don't wanna make your mum wait."He stood up from my bed and hugged me from behind, hiding his face in my neck and sending quivers all over my body as a huge fire exploded in my heart."I'm incredibly sorry again, darling. I wish you didn't have to go through that shit," he whispered against my skin. I wanted to turn around and kiss him, hear him saying how much he loved me too and that he will never leave me. Instead, I palmed his arms around my waist."I'm already used," I replied with the softest voice I could. "Shall we go?"He took a deep breath and separated from me, nodding. When I was about to move to the door, trying to put more distance between us, he caught my hand into his, interlacing his fingers tightly with mine.Oh, Freddie, you aren't helping me to not love you even more.

Once I said goodbye to both Liv and Pauline, Fred and I arrived at the Burrow. As soon as I set a foot in the house, I moved from Fred's side. The nightmare was still too present in my mind not to feel chills at the only thought of my mother, and even though I wanted to be as close to the ginger as possible, I also didn't want to be so attached to him."Oh, Lilith, dear! So happy to see you!" Mrs Weasley smiled at me. I was still surprised by her attitude since I thought once I was out of her home she would go back to hate me but warm comfort invaded when I confirmed she was still being nice. "Remus and Tonks will be here too later in the evening. Thought you would like their company.""Thank you, Mrs Weasley.""You look a bit tired, dear. Have you eaten well?" she asked, scowling, while she hugged her son, next to me."Yes, don't worry," I managed to say, forcing a smile."Lilith had a bit of a rough week at the Quidditch field, mum. She's been training hard, just that," Fred quickly talked, gazing at me briefly, handling the situation. "Are Bill and Fleur already in France?""I think so, but I wish your brother could spend Christmas with his family instead of with that...girl."I thanked him silently and went straight to meet Hermione, who was sat on the couch reading."What 're you doing, little swot," I smiled at her, letting myself fall by her side. She imitated my smile and closed her book to pay me attention. "You okay?""Yeah, don't worry. I'm glad you are here now," Ron walked in front of us and she glared at him. "I can't deal with that idiot by myself anymore."I arched one of my eyebrows. "What did he do?"Hermione sighed, frustrated and turned around to face me, starting to whisper."Did you know he is dating Lavender Brown? They even kiss in front of me.""Really? I thought he knew you like him," I whispered too, confused."Shhh, I don't like him, Lilith!"I snorted, ironic, and stared at her. "'Mione, don't need to lie to me, love."She clicked her tongue and rested her head on my shoulder. "Okay, maybe I do like him. But he's being an idiot. Lately, he doesn't have time for Harry and me now that he has his wonderful girlfriend."I caressed her hair and left a kiss on her forehead. "Oh, girl, you're lucky I'm here.""How've you been by the way?""Ugh, had a really bad nightmare tonight. Otherwise, I'm good. You already know everything.""Was it about...her?""Yes," I saw Harry entering through the front door and making eye contact with me, a little smile appeared on his face as he walked towards us. "Harry's coming, I'll tell you later what was it about.""Good to see you, Lilith" the Potter boy talked, sitting in one of the armchairs next to the couch."Wotcher, Harry. S'everything good?""As good as it can," he sighed without erasing the little smile on his face.Seconds later, Ginny entered the place too and she went straight to us. "Morning, Lilith.""Hi, love," I left a quick kiss on her cheek as she sat by my side."I'm here too, you know?" Hermione smiled, pretending to be offended."Oh, don't be jealous, 'Mione," I caught her face between my hands and started to spread little kisses all over her cheeks, making her snicker.We spend the rest of the day together while Mrs Weasley was preparing dinner. I offered to help her but she refused.It was almost dinner time when Remus and Tonks arrived. Remus seemed tired and a bit thinner than the last time I saw him and Tonks had cut her hair and was wearing it in a dark brown colour. So weird of her, but she still looked good. As soon as he saw me, Remus's eyes softened and he quickly opened his arms to hold me."I've missed you," I whispered, grabbing tightly the fabric of his jacket."Missed you too, dear. Are you okay? Liv wrote me to say you had a nightmare last night."I let out a long sighed. "Yeah, but don't worry. I'll be good."Moving from his arms to Tonks's, the girl also hugged me tightly. "How's my favourite girl?""I'm good, Dora. But not as good as you, you look different!"She ran her fingers through her hair, smiling. "Well, yeah, I'm trying a more serious and adult-like style," she made a funny face, making me snicker."You look good in any way so...""DINNER TIME!" Mrs Weasley announced with a smile, putting the food over the table and making her voice echo all over the house.I ended up sitting in the middle of Remus and Tonks, with Fred, George and Ginny in front of us. I could feel Fred's eyes over me every once in a while but I tried to keep talking to Tonks to avoid looking at him.Right after we finished eating, Harry sat next to Remus on the couch to tell him everything that was going on at Hogwarts while I helped Mrs Weasley to clean."You don't need to do this, dear. You are my guest," the ginger woman repeated to me."I insist. If I'm going to stay here for a couple of days the least I can do is help you, Mrs.""Lilith," I heard Fred's voice behind me. I quickly turned around. He had his hands in the pockets of his trousers and was looking at me with a serious, but at the same time kinda worried, face. "Can I talk to you for a moment?"I swallowed hard but managed to nod."You two can go upstairs. It's a bit more silent," Mrs Weasley smiled at the two of us. Fred didn't wait for my response, instead, he grabbed my wrist and carefully dragged me upstairs. He closed the door of the room that used to be his behind him and looked at me, confused."What you wanted to talk about?" I asked, softly."Did I do something wrong?" he burst, surprising me.I scowled."No, why?""You've been avoiding me all day. And I don't mean by not being with me, I know none of us wants to overwhelm the other, but you look so distant of me."I sighed again, looking at my feet. "I'm sorry you felt that way, but that's nonsense, Freddie. I'm okay, I promise."He didn't say a word but crossed his arms in front of his chest and arched his eyebrows, showing me he didn't believe me a word."It's just that..." the thoughts rambled through my mind like a hurricane. I shook my head. "Forget it, okay?"He snorted, and ran his fingers through his hair, looking frustrated."Why don't you trust me, Lilith?" Fred murmured with a soft tone that went straight to my heart. "I thought that after everything that has happened between the two of us we could at least be friends...""And we are, aren't we? But it's not that easy, Fred.""Is it because of how I behave with you in the past? Are you never going to forgive me?""It's not that!" this was my time to snort, feeling my nerves on edge. "That's completely forgotten, and you know it.""Then what is it?!""IT'S BECAUSE I'M SCARED, FRED!" I burst out, feeling my voice trembly and every inch of my body pushing to its own limit. "You want to know what I dreamt? I dreamt with her telling me how every man in my life has abandoned me and how I deserve it. And she was right. And I'm already tired of it. Don't you understand it, Freddie? We are now friends, really close and really special friends, and you can't imagine how much I appreciate it, but eventually, you will get tired of me and I don't think I can take more attachments to someone who is going to leave me, as they always do."Fred's expression flinched and he stood up straight. He seemed genuinely hurt but at the same time, trying to put a shield in front of him. Fuck, the last thing I want is to hurt his feelings."You don't know that," he murmured calm, shaking his head. "You don't get to fucking tell what I'm going or not going to do, Lilith, and I haven't given you any reason to think like that."I clicked my tongue looking away and crossing my arms in front of my chest. How can I explain to him that the only reason I'm behaving like this is that I feel like I'm drowning inside of my own emotions? How can I put into words that all the trauma that my own mother has caused me makes me unwillingly mistrust every single man in my life?Before I could talk again, George knocked on the door and opened it without waiting for our response."I don't mean to impose whatever silly and stupid argument you two are on, but - the Death Eaters are out there."I felt my heart and my soul leaving my body and how the blood froze in my veins.THE - WHO?!I got out of the room immediately, feeling my heart pounding against my chest and every single bone in my body freezing in pain. Watching through the big window, under the dark night with dim moonlight, I saw her on the ground. Standing up in front of that row of fire that gave her an even more deadly look, next to the mad bitch of Bellatrix Lestrange herself, looking fierce and evil at the same time.Circe.

This can't be fucking true.Time stopped and my breathing became more erratic as I felt a bunch of emotions mixing up together in my inside - astonishment, fear, surprise, misery, exhaustion - like in the middle of a thunderstorm where the main one was, by far, the rage.I don't even know how I got downstairs so quickly but while hearing Fred's voice calling me, which I ignored, I ran to the front door, walking through Remus and Tonks, being almost immediately followed by Harry. My mind could only focus on a single thing; her.Bellatrix and Circe looked at each other and, smiling, ran in different paths through the high grass and wheat field. Oh, no, you are not escaping from me, mother. I ran behind her hearing Remus and Tonks's voices in the back."HARRY, LILITH, NO!"I ran and ran, feeling the air barely getting into my lungs as the moonlight was the only way to let me see through the darkness, but I wasn't planning on letting her go this easily. I could see in the distance the shadow of her black dress and the echo of her breathing as Bellatrix's maniac laugh far away. Surrounded by the wheat, in the middle of a tiny little clearing, I stopped her."Mother!"She froze in her place and slowly - probably surprised that I chose to address her like that - she turned around to face me. I held my breath. Circe was looking just like in my dreams but more healthy. Her curly brown hair had recovered its old bright and silkiness, her eyes, far from being empty, seemed to shine like two jets full of evilness and wickedness and she seemed to be much more in shape than the last time I saw her. I could feel the beating of my heart pounding so hard against my ribcage that I thought it would break it."Lili," she greeted me, with that whisper that sounded like a snake's hiss, digging deeply and slowly into my heart like a dagger. "baby."Her voice sent chills of terror through my entire body, but I didn't flinch. I wasn't going to give her that satisfaction."So many years without seeing you. You have become a beautiful woman. What a shame your life choices haven't been that beautiful."I swallowed hard, almost unable to believe that I was in front of her. In front of Circe. My mother."I knew you'd come. Sooner or later. I knew it," I managed to say.She smirked, looking even more wicked than before. Her whole presence felt like a heavy weight on my back."I already told you more than once, Lili. You can't escape from me."I felt my eyes watering, - how she fucking dares? - but I forced myself to swallow those tears to avoid looking weak in front of her."Why? Why can't you let me live in peace? I have had enough of you, Circe," I whispered."Because you're my daughter, whether you like it or not. I'll always be the one who gave birth to you and you will always have part of me in you. You were born to be just like me.""No," I said firmly and drily, taking deep breathes. "I wasn't born like this. Your selfishness and your thirst for revenge made me like this. You might be my mother but you never cared to behave like so," I felt a single tear leave my eyes but didn't bother to wipe it off. "even before - what happened with...him, there were moments where all you had to do was be my mother," I bit my lip to control myself, feeling the ashy and smokey mist surrounding us. Overwhelming me. Fuck, I don't even know how I keep breathing, "and even then, you abandoned me too, didn't you? You left me alone, and you hurt me - like no one else in this damn world has done."She rolled her eyes, without erasing her smile. "Don't you dare to even mention him in front of me, Lilith. Your father wasn't exactly who you think he was. And don't be so dramatic, if I wasn't the mother you wanted is because you never were the daughter I needed. You let me rot in that jail even though you knew I had planned a perfect future for the two of us.""I WAS A KID, YOU CRAZY BITCH! I was just a kid with no father and a non mentally stable mother. And you know damn well I never wanted that stupid future of yours.""Because you're a traitor.""Oh, for fuck's sake, Circe!"She snickered, devilishly. "And you know what, Lili? Inside the Death Eaters, traitors are punished." She took a deep breath, staring piercingly into my soul. "Greyback! Rockwood! Come here!"From the darkness of the field, two tall figures came out slowly and patiently. Both men stood up by my mother's side, giving me goosebumps. Rockwood had his eyes firmly over her and Greyback was staring at me, showing his fangs and his bright eyes that scared me till the core. I didn't move, though. I was going to stay there; firm and brave.I felt a huge despise when I saw the two men; one of them was one of the reasons why Mrs Weasley and Fred himself hated me for a long time and the other one was the reason why Remus had suffered pain since he was a little boy. I hated them. Deeply.They started to walk towards me when my mother snapped her fingers, showing me her long and sharp nails. I froze in my place, feeling my feet rooted to the floor."Stay away from me," I quickly said, trying to grab my wand. They didn't listen. Instead, Rockwood positioned behind me, closing any sort of escape for me, while Greyback stood up facing me. I guided my elbow to Rockwood's ribs in a hard hit when he tried to grab my arms. "Don't you dare to touch me, murderer.""Fuck. Mrs, she's stronger than we thought," the man complained looking at my mother."Of course she is strong, you idiot. She's a Beater."I opened my eyes widely. How did she know?"Oh, yes, baby, I know more about you than you think," Circe smirked, making the cold run fast all over my spine.Rockwood grabbed my arms exposing me in front of Greyback while I tried to fight them. I was about to get rid of his grip when Bellatrix appeared next to my mother, looking as rotted and psychotic as she did when she was in Azkaban."Look at that, the biggest traitor to walk this planet," the Lestrange woman chanted. "You filthy Half-Blood."Greyback smelled me, caressing one of the pieces of my hair, making me want to vomit."How beautiful Little Circe is...""Take your hands off me, you fucking bastard!" I spat, literally, to his face, watching him wipe it off, while I was still trying to get rid of Rockwood. Bellatrix pointed at me with her wand and before I could let out a word, she cursed me;"CRUCIO!"The red light hit me immediately and a loud and heartrending scream tore my throat as the overwhelming, devastating and sharp pain hit me hard."LILITH!" I could hear Fred's voice shouting, desperate, really far away from where I was.I fell to the ground, writhing in pain as the curse penetrated my body. I no longer knew where I was and my head felt about to burst. The pain, intense and all-consuming, was as if knives were running inside my veins, every muscle of my body exploding, nails deep pounded into my bones till my core, destroying me and breaking me into pieces. I couldn't contain my tears anymore and all I wanted was to rip my skin off my body to stop feeling the pain. I didn't beg it to stop, though. I'd rather die than beg this bitch."Stop it, Bella. Let them do it. I want her to remember what happens when you betray mum." Circe interrupted, putting down Lestrange's wand.The pain stopped but my body felt numb and far away. Before I could recover from the curse, Greyback was over me, with his long nails and fangs ready, with only the moonlight in the back.He couldn't transform me into one of them. It wasn't the full moon. But he could hurt me, a lot.I felt how his nails dug into my skin, profoundly, tearing it and marking me as Rockwood kneeled to hold me into the ground. His teeth met my collarbones and he deeply embedded them into the soft flesh making me scream even louder of pure pain. I could feel my head spinning because of all the blood I was losing, and I had to force myself to stay awake.If I fall asleep, maybe I won't be waking up again.Greyback growled, proud, against my skin as I tried uselessly to writhe again.Please, make it stop. I can't handle it anymore. Make it stop."LILITH, WHERE ARE YOU?" Remus's voice was heard and Bellatrix ran back into the wheat field.I closed my eyes because all I could see was that fucking maniac over me, ripping me and hurting me as much as he could, with my mother right in front of us, observing entertained. My throat felt torn, rent and sore because of all my tears and groans of pain.What a way to die -Ripped and slaughtered by my mother's henchmen.I expected better.When I thought I was about to pass out, already feeling the life slipping through my fingers and with the image of certain ginger in my head as a coping mechanism to ignore the fucking psychopath over me, I noticed a red light throwing Greyback and Rockwood far from my body."HANDS OFF MY DAUGHTER, YOU FUCKING BASTARDS!" Remus growled loudly, kneeling by my side. Looking more threatening and scary than I ever saw. I could barely stay awake but I had to force myself to do so."Re-mus..." I managed to whisper, feeling my voice trapped in my own body but at the same time, hearing it far away. He looked at me and the expression of his eyes winced and he gulped, trying to put himself together."Shh, dear, I'm here - I'm here."I wanted to cry, overwhelmed and thankful, finally out of those men's hands."She's mine, you dirty half-breed," Circe glared at him and I was genuinely scared that she would curse him. Remus held me carefully in his arms, looking daggers at her. His only smell and touch made me feel so secure and safe that a good couple of tears left my eyes."FRED!" he shouted, frustrated and full of anger.Immediately, the ginger appeared, sweaty and almost out of breath, through the wheat. He looked at us and I discerned how his eyes widened and how he swallowed hard, with a terrified and worried expression on his face. He quickly kneeled by my side, making eye contact with me. Remus stood up, taking off his wand from his pocket, leaving me in between Fred's arms.Weasley trapped me carefully as if he was scared I would break. He pulled me closer to him while he observed me through his worried eyes. The moonlight shined in them and, for a moment, I felt reaching heaven. Oh, my love."I've been more of a parent to her than you in 19 years. Back off, Snape," Remus mumbled, disgusted, pointing at her with his wand, looking more fierce and threatening than ever. "Fred, take her out of here! I'm going to avenge my kid."The ginger nodded and he lifted the two of us from the ground, carrying me into his arms. My eyes met my mother's just before Fred started to walk away as fast as he could, guiding us through the wheat field. His breath was laboured and the worry stood out in his eyes."F-Freddie," I raised my hand to caress his cheek as he walked us silently away from there, trying to hide us. I gasped when I saw the stain of blood on his face because of my touch."I'm here, darling. They are not going to hurt you anymore," he promptly said with the nerves on edge, pressing me against his chest. "Please, don't close your eyes, my angel. I'm here for you - don't close them."I wanted to cry because of how much I loved him and how protected I felt in his arms, but I didn't have the strength to even speak again.I craved to tell him how much I loved him, I wanted to finally confess it to him and thank him for making me so happy while it lasted, but my eyes started to feel heavy, silencing me and making Fred snort, alarmed."Darling, please look at me. Look at me," he spoke softly but still running and completely alarmed, " We're almost there, keep your eyes on me, Lilith."When we finally got out of the wheat field, I saw how dark shadows impacted the Burrow, setting it on consuming fire."Lilith!" Hermione shouted, coming closer to us."Those fucking beasts..." Tonks spat, with her watery eyes, staring at me."I t-took her out as soon as I could. I don't know what they did to her, I- " Fred stuttered, nervously, looking at his twin. George quickly got by our side, gazing at me worried, and caressing my hand."Stay calm, Freddie. She's gonna be okay - you'll see. She's strong, right, Lilith?" he smiled softly, encouraging me.I wanted to smile at him but only managed to twist the corners of my lips."Remus! What are we going to do? The Burrow... Lilith -" Fred asked, as soon as the man got out off the field, with his suit stained with spots of red blood, and a bit out of breath. "She needs to be healed now!""Everyone, grab your hands! We're going to disappear!" Remus announced, staring at the dark shadows with despise as they destroyed the Weasley house. "Lilith, dear, hold on a bit more, ok? I swear to Godric you'll be fine."I managed to nod softly even though I was using every track of strength in my body. Fred kept me against his body as I pressed my head against his chest, hearing his out of control heartbeat."Just a little bit longer, darling. We are almost there," he whispered, making us enter quickly into a big hut. "You're doing great, angel, you're doing absolutely great."My eyes closed against my will, memorising every single detail of Fred's face.If I'm about to die, at least I'll go away with the memory of my love's eyes.

"Lilith, open your eyes!" I heard Fred's worried voice in the distance.I forced myself to do so, barely able to perceive any else that wasn't him, and I noticed how he leaned me down on a comfortable couch. My body immediately sank into it and I couldn't move a single muscle as my eyes stayed barely open. Fred looked at me with concern shining in his brown eyes as he moved a piece of hair from my face."Mum, what can we do to help her?" he stuttered, quite tongue-tied, looking at my body and clothes covered in my own still wet blood."We need to stop the haemorrhage first," Lupin quickly spoke, before letting Mrs Weasley answer, and coming right to me, positioning behind the couch to have a full view of the situation. "Harry, in one of the drawers you'll find some herbs and ingredients that are helpful for healing potions. Please, bring them as soon as possible. Tonks, please, appear at the Ministry and report the attack and the Death Eaters who did it.""Make sure she's comfortable, Fred. This is going to take some time," Mrs Weasley whispered while putting her hand on Hermione's trembly one. "Dear, can you send a letter to her friend Olivia Lovegood? I bet she would like to know."Both Hermione and Fred nodded nervously and while the Granger girl ran outside, the ginger started to take off my shoes and grab blankets from everywhere in the little hut."Freddie..." I managed to murmur, feeling my throat and my mouth sore and dry. His eyes didn't meet mine but I knew he was paying me attention. I gulped hard, with the pain still in every corner of my body."It's okay - You don't have to do all of this. You don't have to save me.""Fucking yes I do," he simply mumbled back. My heart would have raced if it had had the energy to do it. The fact that he was so willing to save me only made me want to cry because of how much I loved him."Mate, you should probably tear her clothes to see how damaged her skin and muscles are and to stop the infection before it happens," George suggested, making sure Ron and Ginny - who hadn't been able to speak a word - were okay.Remus took a knife from Merlin knows where and handed it to Fred. Before I could make any sound, the ginger rent my shirt, being careful not to hurt me even more. A shared gasp coming from Fred, Remus and Mrs Weasley filled the tense silence."Is it that bad?" Harry asked, behind us.I couldn't even look. I didn't want to whatsoever. Instead, I focused on Fred, who after swallowing hard and paling, went back to treat my wounds."Okay, darling, you're still bleeding too much, we will have to apply a mending charm, a'right? That son of a bitch's claws reached your flesh deeply so the wounds are too profound to heal them easily. Stay awake, angel, that's all I ask you. Please, stay awake.""No! The mending charm can leave her whole body scarred! Are you out of your mind?!" Mrs Weasley protested. I was so gone that her voice sounded incredibly far away even though she was close to us."SHE WILL DIE IF WE DON'T STOP THE HAEMORRHAGE, MUM!" Fred burst, frustrated, running his hand through his hair. "Better to have her with scars than not having her at all."I couldn't help but let out some tears that mixed with the stains of blood and dust on my face, Remus's hand stroked my cheek wiping them off."Shh, dear, it's okay. You'll be okay," his whispering voice calmed me like a soft lull to sleep. Fred tried to take out his wand from the pocket of his trousers but his eyes got lost in my injured body and his hands started to slightly shake. "Fred," Remus called him, noticing as well the trembly movement. "Let me do it. Come 'ere and hold her hand."They immediately switched places and soon, the ginger's warm, soothing and comforting touch wrapped around my hand, making me feel already healed. His eyes stared into mine with thousands of words - that I couldn't decipher - silenced behind that worried sparkle."Darling..." I murmured, faintly, almost unable to move my body as I felt Remus's wand against my skin."I'm here," Fred stated with the same soft tone but also sincere. "I will not leave you. I'm not Ares."The tears piled up in my eyes again and I had to bite my lip to hold them back. Fred left a quick kiss on my forehead and held my hand while Remus kept applying all the healing spells he could.A little whimper came out of my mouth when I felt my flesh sewing up together, it was disgusting. Fred squeezed my hand."Hang in there, Lilith, I know you can. Remus, can you be a bit gentler?"Lupin glared at him briefly and then shook his head. "I would if I could, Fred. I'm not going to hurt her voluntarily."My body felt numb even though the pain - which had decreased - was still present. Minutes felt like an eternity and even though my life wasn't slipping through my fingers anymore, I was still scared that at any moment, I would close my eyes not to open them ever again."Here, dear, drink this," Mrs Weasley offered me a little mug and make me drink the potion. It tasted bloody bad but I still swallowed it because they were taking the trouble to heal me and doing everything they could to save me."I have just received a reply from Liv, she will arrive tomorrow early in the morning. Apparently, Ireland is being observed and she can't appear inside the hut," Hermione came back, still nervous.Mrs Weasley caressed my hair putting it away from my face."That's it. She will have some little scars but at least she will survive," Remus said, exhausted and sleep-deprived. "You can let her sleep, I bet she's exhausted.""I'm - sorry," I whispered, feeling my eyes shutting."About what?""Make you take the time to save me... I'll never be able to thank you enough," the words came immediately out of my mouth, smoother than before.Fred shook his head and Remus clicked his tongue. "Don't be a fool, Lilith. You are like a daughter to me and their friend. Of course we would do whatever it's in our hand and even more to save you.""Now rest, dear. You need it," Molly smiled at me. "Come with me, kids. I will show you the rooms, the hut is small but at least is a safe place.""I'm staying," Fred quickly burst."Mate, you can let her rest. She'll be okay," George tried to convince him but his twin refused, with his eyes still on me."No, no, I'm not moving me from here."I wanted to thank him for everything he was doing for me and to tell him he could go and rest,  but my mind was so tired and my eyes felt so heavy that I couldn't form a word. Instead, I immediately fell profoundly asleep.That night, I didn't dream.✵ ✵ ✵The faint sunny light through the clouds from dawn woke me up. My body still hurt sharply and I barely could move on my own, but the pain didn't stop my heart from racing when I saw the image in front of me.Fred was sitting there right next to me, with his head rested in between his hands and his hair messed. I thought he would stay for a while and then leave to sleep after the hard night he had, but judging by his appearance, he had stayed by my side the whole night. Oh, Freddie."Freddie," I called him in a soft whisper. He immediately moved, quite caught by surprise, rubbing his eyes with his hands."Yes, darling? You need anything?" Fred spoke with a sleepy low voice."Did you stay here all night?""Of course," he said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "I wasn't going to leave you here."My heart melted at his words far more than it should."You didn't have to -""I did have to, Lilith," he interrupted me. " You could have needed me."My hand went straight to cup his cheek and he left a short soft kiss on it, moving his hand to caress mine. I was about to answer back but a little knock outside the door interfered. Fred's eyes opened widely and he immediately stood up, grabbing his wand."Who's there?""Me. Olivia," Liv's soft voice spoke with a hint of worry in her tone.He immediately opened the door letting the blonde enter the place."Shit, I should have asked you something else to prove you are you," Fred complained, running his hands through his tired face."Don't worry, I don't think a Death Eater would knock to the door," she popped off without thinking. "Where is she?"The ginger pointed with his head at the couch where I was still laying. Liv's eyes focused on mine and she immediately walked to get in front of me, kneeling by my side."Liv...""I'm here, you reckless bitch," she whispered, grabbing my hand and leaving lots of kisses on it. "What on Earth crossed your mind to decide it was a good idea running after your mother, huh? You can't leave me so bloody soon, fuck. And if you are, at least take me with you."I couldn't help but snicker, feeling the pain in my entire chest but bearing with it."You should already know I don't think things too much. And I'd never let you come with me."She clicked her tongue moving the blankets Fred had put to cover my body during the night. Since the wounds were still healing, I could only wear my underwear so to keep me warm, he wrapped around me three heavy blankets Liv had to slightly move to examine me."Who healed you?""Remus, Mrs Weasley and Fred. Where's Lin?""Putting the last protective spells on the flat, she will come later with some meds I asked her," she said, running her fingers carefully through the fresh scars. "Mending charm? That's smart. You know you won't be fully healed in a good couple of weeks, right? These wounds look too deep even for healing magic.""We did as much as we could. We were lucky the hut already had some ingredients for healing potions," Fred started, walking to sit in the armchair next to Liv. "We gave her the most powerful one we could.""Good. She'll still need meds and a lot of rest. Do you mind if I stay here? I don't think we can move her from the hut in at least two weeks.""I'm staying too so, of course you can.""Liv! You're finally here!" Remus's voice spoke behind me. He patted Olivia's shoulder while standing next to me. "How are you feeling, dear?""Still like shit, but at least I'm not dying anymore," I managed to say, smiling at him. As the rest of the house started to arrive as well, all of them stopped for a while with me, making sure I was okay.George brought me breakfast to then show Liv the room she could occupy. Mrs Weasley, Ginny and Hermione helped me to move to the tiny restroom to clean up the dry blood from my body and to put on a clean white nightgown since it was the only clothes that wouldn't mess the bandages covering my fresh scars and wounds. Harry prepared me another healing potion, Ron and Tonks did their best to make me giggle a couple of times and also brought me water every time I needed it. I felt useless, though. When Hermione helped me to stand up, Liv had to hold me from behind since my legs barely responded to me. What a fucking shit. When Pauline arrived, she did just like Liv and ran to kneel in front of me to examine my wounds. Since one of her specialities at Beauxbatons was healing magic, she suggested making a Cameroonian potion which she had learnt and that none of us had ever heard about but that made me feel way better than the average healing potion.Already at night again, after being a bit forced by Remus to eat dinner with the excuse of having to recover strength; Fred, Liv, George, Pauline and Hermione stayed with me for a little longer."You can't sleep here today," Hermione quickly said, obvious. "You will wake up with a huge back pain.""'Mione, I think I'm already aching enough to worry about back pain," I murmured with a smile. "Don't worry, love, I promise you I'll be okay.""Why don't you sleep with Liv and me?" Pauline suggested."No, we would barely fit in the bed and I don't want to bother you two.""You don't bother us, for Merlin's sake," Liv clicked her tongue."Liv, I'll be okay."Everyone stayed silent for a couple of seconds and my eyes moved to the window, where the stars were starting to appear and the sky was gradually tinting more and more of a dark blue."I'm staying with you then," Fred broke the silence."No, you already did last night. You need to rest too," I immediately replied, serious."I don't care.""Fred. I said no."He shook his head."I don't care what you say. I'm not leaving you alone, you might need something during the night and you can barely move on your own," he replied, more serious and firm but still with his calm and relaxed expression and tone. "If you don't want to sleep here, we can sleep on my bed. I bet it's way more comfortable than this couch.""If you don't do it, Lilith. I'm staying here with you." Liv said, pretty earnest too."Me too," Hermione nodded, firmly."Go, Lilith," George spoke for the first time, trying to reason with me. "Fred's room is small but his bed is big enough for the two of you. I know you feel better than yesterday but you are nowhere near being healed enough and you might need something later during the night. Let us help you as much as we can."I meditated on his words. I craved a comfortable bed with soft sheets, but at the same time, I was scared of having a nightmare while sleeping with Fred. I couldn't even remember the last time I had slept with a man in the same bed. Liv's eyes and mine met and I knew she was guessing my thoughts."Try to sleep there, Lilith. Just to try and George's right, you're not well enough to let you sleep unsupervised."Finally, I nodded and they let out a relieved sigh. Liv, Pauline and Hermione tried to help me to stand up but since my legs failed me shamelessly, George had to pick me up and carry me while his brother ran to his room to have the bed ready."Here you are," George murmured, placing me on the bed, while Hermione ran to cover me with the sheets and blankets."Thanks, Georgie. Thank all of you. I couldn't wish for better friends even if they existed."They smiled all grouping at the door."Anything for our favourite mate," the ginger said, winking at me."Fred, if she..." Hermione swallowed hard before continuing, "gets worse, don't hesitate to wake us up, alright?"Fred nodded, while putting the meds Pauline handed him on the nightstand."Take care of my best friend, Weasley," Liv warned, pointing at him and giving him her most serious look.After closing the door behind them, the silence filled the room."I'm sorry for how much I'm bothering you, Freddie."He arched one of his eyebrows and shook his head."Stop saying that bullshit, Lilith. You're not bothering me," he moved the sheets from his side of the bed but suddenly, he froze in his place and stared at me. "I can sleep in that chair if you want, darling. I want you to be comfortable."I saw the old and overused wood chair and felt a sour taste in my mouth only to think about leaving Fred sleeping there while I enjoyed his comfortable, fresh, clean bed. I swallowed all the fears in my mind and looked back at him."No, Freddie. I want you here, with me."A little smile appeared on his face and I felt my heart melting as he got inside the bed, letting me feel his corporal warmth by my side."I will sleep on this side of the bed not to bother you - and don't hesitate to wake me up if you need anything, alright?"I nodded and he left a soft and quick kiss on my cheek."Good night, Freddie.""Good night, darling."The lights went off and a single thought filled my mind as I laid comfortably on the bed, noticing how my eyes slowly closed while Fred's scent and soft breathing made me feel safe and sound.I love you even more.

Even though Fred's bed was one of the most comfortable ones I ever slept in, at some point during the night, I couldn't help but slightly wake up when I felt someone sleeping by my side who wasn't Liv nor Hermione. My eyes opened dimly and I melted as soon as I saw him.Even profoundly asleep he was incredibly handsome — fucking Merlin, how could some be so handsome? — and memorising in my mind every single detail in his god-like face, I had the urge to touch him. Fred's eyelashes almost rested over his cheekbones, his lips were slightly opened and his breathing was calm and paused while the moonlight from the window illuminated very dimly the dorm.Thinking about how much he had worried about me and how well he was treating me, the feelings inside of me burnt me more than ever and the butterflies felt more like a hurricane at this point. I can't hold it anymore. I need to say it out loud. Caressing the smooth skin of his cheek, making sure he was still sleeping, and with my heart pounding so hard I thought it would wake him up, I approached him a bit more."I love you, Fred Weasley," I whispered in a low voice, admiring his serene face, the curve of his lips, the little freckles spread on his cheeks. In an outburst of emotion, I left a quick and delicate kiss on his dimly opened lips, wanting to fuse with him. "I love you so fucking much."Fred moved slightly and breathed more heavily. Fuck, fuck, fuck, please, keep sleeping!My heart pounded in my chest with more strength than ever before and I felt the blood abandoning my face. However, Fred didn't move, he simply babbled something in his dream and continued sleeping.I sighed relieved and with a little smile on my lips, I finally fell asleep too, appreciating the ginger's features and slightly more liberated now that I was able to put into words those consuming feelings.✵ ✵ ✵When I woke up by the dim light entering the room, I was surprised not only by the fact that I didn't have any kind of nightmare during the night but also by seeing a couple of strong arms carefully hugging me from behind as a paused breathing could be heard right behind my ear. I didn't know at what point Fred started hugging me in our sleep but I felt so protected and comfortable in his arms that couldn't even think about moving aside.Fred cleared his throat and I felt how he took one of his arms to rub his eye."Good morning, darling," he murmured with a gruff sleepy voice that would have turned me on if it wasn't because my body still hurt. "How did you sleep?"He tried to pull me even closer to his body but didn't control his strength and hurt my waist a little bit, making me hiss."Oh Merlin, I'm so sorry! I'm so so sorry! Are you okay? Did I hurt you?""It's okay, I'm still weak, sorry. But I slept really well," I turned around to face him and give him a smile, showing I was indeed fine."Did I bother you?""Not a bit."Fred imitated my smile and took his hand to stroke my cheek softly. The butterflies grouped in my stomach and I forced myself not to put my eyes away from his."You are staying the night again, ok? I'd like to keep an eye on you."I nodded a bit nervous but more confident than before since I really rested incredibly good. This was the first time we had slept together and, happily for my devilish and primal side, my first thought was that I could get used to it.Fred sighed and laid down on his back, running his hand by my waist to put me even closer to him, making me rest my head on his chest."Did I disturb you?" I asked in a whisper.He chuckled. "Not at all, darling. You're really comfortable to sleep with.""So says Liv. I think that's why she bears with me," I smiled. "Such a huge patience she has with me.""Bah! You know Liv loves you as much as she loves Luna. Granger said yesterday that when she told her about — the accident," he swallowed hard trying not to think about that awful night. "she was incredibly desperate to come here. She was really worried about you."His hand went from my waist to my hair, caressing it with affection. I wanted to never leave that bed or to be away from him, I wanted to stay like that for the rest of my life."Everybody was. You can't imagine how much," his voice got a much deeper and darker tone. "When I saw you over there — laying down with all your body covered in your own blood and your eyes almost empty — I think I've never felt so afraid of losing someone. And later, when I saw how bad that fucking son of a bitch had hurt you...I only wanted to run away back to the Burrow and kill him myself."My heart stopped briefly."It's okay now. At least I'm not dead," I moved my face to see him and we both smiled at each other. "But I'm gonna get my revenge, though. Sooner or later, I'll get it."Since my body was still aching too much for me to walk by myself, we spent the whole day together in bed. Everyone in the house tried to entertain me and we end up having so many laughs together, forgetting about what had happened.Liv helped me to shower and to walk to the restroom every time I needed it, Hermione and Pauline changed my bandages and Ginny helped me to put on another clean nightgown and to brush my hair. Mrs Weasley made me an awesome soup and light food since my throat still felt a bit sore, Tonks and Remus checked my wounds twice and Harry and Ron brought me some books from the shelves of the hut in case I was bored. Fred stayed with me all the time and made sure I was not bored at all. We ended up chatting a lot and sharing stories together, bonding like friends as much as I never thought we would do."...So I turned his teddy bear into a spider," Fred snickered while telling the story, helping me to put the blankets over the naked skin of my legs to then lay by my side."That's why Ron is scared of spiders?!" I tried to hold back my laughter, looking at him surprised. Fred giggled nodding and I softly slapped his hand. "Fred! Poor boy!""I'm his older brother, if someone has to cause him trauma that's me," he replied, proudly."Well, I shouldn't say anything when I have slightly traumatised Draco too. When he was twelve, I gave him an inflated condom and made him think it was a balloon."The ginger burst into laughter. "And when did he notice it was a johnny?"I tightened my lips, trying not to laugh, and let out in a little murmur; "When he got back home...and showed it to his dad..."Fred laughed even harder and I couldn't contain myself anymore."We aren't so different after all, are we?" he piped up, grinning."Maybe not.""You should have been in Gryffindor."I snorted. "You should have been in Slytherin.""I mean, green suits me. And, who knows, maybe if we had been in the same house we wouldn't have wasted six years hating each other so stupidly.""Probably. But let's keep it real, darling. We both know being enemies turned us on too much," I winked at him and Fred snickered, arching one of his eyebrows."Innit."We slept together again that night, but instead of being each one in their side of the bed, Fred quickly dragged me carefully to his body and hugged me, keeping me away from the winter night cold. A sweet warmth installed inside my chest and spread all over my body, letting me feel fully his touch and his scent.Once again, I didn't dream anything but I was happier than ever about it. Could it be possible that Fred was one of the people who could nullify my nightmares?I woke up early in the morning with a dull pain in my lower belly. Since Fred was peacefully sleeping, with an angel face that made him even look innocent, I didn't want to bother him so I managed to move away from his arms and walk to the tiny restroom in our dorm, helping myself by holding on to the walls.When I put down my underwear, I clicked my tongue in disapproval.Fucking shit, my period has arrived. As if I haven't lost already blood enough.I truly didn't want to wake up Fred, but I couldn't just stay there bleeding."Bloody hell," I whispered, running my hand through my face. "Fred!"Nothing happened."Freddie!"I heard a couple of sounds as if someone was running in the room."Yes, darling? What's wrong?" Fred's sleepy and alarmed voice spoke from behind the door."I have a little problem..." I said a bit embarrassed."What is it?""I just got my period..."I thought an uncomfortable silence would get installed between us but instead, he replied almost immediately."Do you want me to ask any of the girls for pads? Or do you use tampons?"Surprised, I managed to talk without stuttering. "Pads are okay, and a pair of clean knickers, please."Not even five minutes went by when Fred knocked again on the door and opened it slightly to sneak his arm handing me a pack of pads and a pair of black knickers and also, a clean shirt and a pair of sweatpants."Thank you. Who gave them to you?""'S okay, Liv gave me the knickers and Ginny had the pads. The clothes are mine, I thought you'd be more comfortable in them than in another nightgown. Tell me if you need anything else, alright?"I got ready, hugging myself in Fred's clothes and letting me feel his scent sewn to my skin. When I finally came out of the restroom, I found the ginger changing the bedsheets. But when I saw a little stain of blood in the white fabric, my cheeks felt like burning."Oh, shit, did I stained them?" I asked, completely embarrassed, in a low murmur. Fred looked at me and gave me a comforting smile."Yes, but it's okay, I'm changing them and putting some new and fresh ones.""I'm sorry...""Lilith, don't worry. It's normal."I tried to help him to make the bed but he immediately tutted. "I'm doing it. You sit right there, resting like the good girl you are until it's done."Tingles covered my body and I obeyed him, letting out a painful hiss as my muscles complained when I sat down."Does it hurt too much?" Fred asked, glancing at me."The wounds or my ovaries?""Both," he snickered and I imitated him."My wounds still too much, but I'm gettin' used to it. And my ovaries, a bit," I replied honestly, "but I don't know why because I take the contraceptive pill for the pain and for...obvious reasons."He nodded, trying to hide discreetly how he licked his lips. "I asked if there were any meds for it in here but no one has any. Tonks offered to get some since she has to go back to London anyway.""Nah, it's fine. I'm a'right, it's bearable.""Been through worst, huh?" he joked, walking towards me."Much worst," I chuckled, grabbing his offered hand to help me to stand up.He pulled me closer to his body, carefully, and made me sit on the bed. During the entire day, he was incredibly attentive; he brought me chocolate, brought Liv clean bandages for me, walked me to the loo every time I needed to change and made sure to keep me as entertained as the previous day. By midday, Remus brought me some meds hoping they would relieve the pain but, much to my dismay, they didn't.I was laying down in fetal position, pressing softly my lower belly trying to soothe the pain and not to writhe because of it or to complain too much when I heard Fred clicked his tongue behind me, caressing my back."Haven't the meds taken effect yet?""...No," I managed to say, quite sad and still uncomfortable. Fucking pills, you are supposed to work for more than just avoid me getting pregnant."Lay on your back, I think I know what to do," he whispered, pensive. He lifted delicately my shirt, exposing the area of my abdomen, and rubbed his hands together to warm them up. Then, he put them on my lower belly, against my cold skin, and started massaging that part, alleviating the pain almost immediately. "Mum taught us to do this for Ginny. She suffers a lot from very painful periods too."He continued to massage my belly, my shoulders and my feet — until the pain was just a memory and my body was incredibly pleased and relaxed."Better?" he asked me, sitting by my side."Much better!" I burst, surprised, staring at him. "Wow, thank you, Fred. For everything."He snickered, grabbing my hand to caress it sending faint quivers through my spine and making appear that warmth in my chest again."You say it as if it wasn't the most common thing to do.""Well, you're the first man who takes care of me this much during my period," I confessed, being honest.He stared at me, surprised, and slightly scowled without erasing the little smile on his face."Really?""Yeah...well, I mean, Draco used to bring me chocolate and the pills from Madame Pomfrey.""What? You mean Diggory didn't do any of this for your pain?"I giggled. "Mate, you do have a weird concept about Ced and I's connection. We were just friends, with benefits for a couple of months, but mainly friends.""Well, then, I'm happy to know that I'm the one pampering you the most," he smirked, pulling me closer to him and cuddling me in between his arms."Freddie...you're suffocating me a bit," I chuckled, still without moving because I loved to be so glued at him."My favourite spoiled brat," he ignored me, joking, still hugging me."Fred!" I giggled, punching softly his chest."Do you want some hot chocolate? Mum's making it and George told me earlier Liv, Pauline, Hermione and him are planning to bring you some cassettes and more things to be entertained. I think Granger found one of those muggle devices looking like a box but with people inside...""You mean a telly?" I asked, looking at him, trying uselessly to hide my laugh."Yes, you smart-ass, that," he rolled his eyes, still smiling."Yeah, I'd love it.""Great, stay here," Fred stood up after leaving a quick kiss on my cheek."It's not like I can go anywhere in case you haven't noticed."He turned around, walking backwards. "Better for me then. Can have entirely for my own," he winked, making the butterflies in my stomach go absolutely crazy.You always have me entirely, Freddie.

After the two weeks at the hut, being incredibly well treated all the time by Fred and the rest, I could finally have a bit more independence."You sure you won't need me?" Fred asked, putting on a worn-out denim jacket that suited him so fucking much I could feel my body craving him again."Yes." I rolled my eyes with a little smile on my face. "Besides, you'll be back at a time to leave together back to Diagon Alley."This was my last day at the hut and seeing how Fred was starting to get tired of being constantly surrounded by these four walls, I convinced him to go out for a walk with Liv, Pauline and George while I stayed here with Harry, Ron and Ginny. He accepted kinda reluctantly."Fine. By the way, I already sent Iris to the Quidditch field with a letter for Khaleelah."I tightened my lips, nodding. After being examined by Tonks, Remus and Mrs Weasley, they agreed I wouldn't be able to play for, at least, another two weeks. It made me incredibly sad since Quidditch with the Harpies was my passion and I was truly enjoying how were doing at the league."Freddie, can you bring a mirror from any of the rooms later once you're back?" I asked, playing with my nails a bit nervous. "I'd like to see by myself how the wounds are."He sighed, "Lilith - are you sure?"I nodded and after meditating on it, he imitated me.Before leaving, Fred approached me at the bed and when I thought he was going to leave a little kiss on my cheek, he went for my lips instead. It was soft and quick but it stirred every part in my body after so long without his touch."See you later, beautiful.""Have fun!"Not even ten minutes went by when Ron, Harry and Ginny burst into my room."Morning!" they said at the same time, Ron and Harry sitting at the back of the bed, in front of me, and Ginny laying by my side, careful not to hurt me."Wotcher, lads. Where's 'Mione?" I smiled at them, but slightly confused.Ron snorted, "She didn't want to come, she's a bit mad at me. Said she would come later to see you."I chuckled, "What did you do this time?""I swear to Godric I did nothing! Just found me writing a letter and she thought it was for Lavender!"Ginny shook her head giggling while Harry had his eyes focused on her. It didn't escape from my sight how little sparkles shined in his green eyes as he observed the gorgeous ginger girl. Ginny was, without doubt, one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen and now that she had grown up a bit more, she had developed some mature features that matched perfectly with the mischievous look she had inherited from the twins, making her incredibly attractive. Could it be possible that Potter was falling for his best friend's sister?"You know Hermione quite well, Lilith. Can you give me any advice?" Ron called my attention. "I asked Ginny but she won't tell me anything.""If you stopped being an asshole, I would," she intervened, without putting her eyes away from Harry's."Bugger off!""Well, if you ask me, Hermione is quite easy to please, Ron. I don't know how you mess it up with her so much." I spoke, with an amused smile on my face. "She might look a bit cold but I can assure you she craves affection."Ron scowled, confused."What kind of affection?""Uhmm, hugs, playing with her hands, looking at her straight to the eye when she's speaking - but without looking creepy, y'know - oh, and she absolutely loves to have her cheek cupped when she's kissing.""Oh, cool - hang on, how do you know that?!"I snickered, mischievously before Harry and Ginny's wide-open eyes."Think a little bit, mate."Ron seemed to get it and he looked at me paler and even more confused."YOU TWO KISSED?""Yes.""WHAT THE - WHEN?!""Ages ago. In our dorm at Grimmauld. You come a bit late, you know?""OH, MERLIN! WHY DIDN'T I KNOW ABOUT IT?""Maybe because you're always in your own world?" Ginny chuckled and Potter's smile grew as he looked at her."Uhmm, a bit off-topic but, Lilith," Harry spoke, making me look at him. "Fred has been super attentive with you, how is it that you two are getting along so well?"I giggled even louder than before."Mate, I've been fucking him since summer 1995."The two boys burst laughing nervously and Ginny and I stared at each other, with an accomplice smile, and then back to them with our eyebrows arched."Oh, wait, you're being serious?" Ron asked."Obvs. Don't tell me you're noticing it right now..."Harry choked with his own saliva and started coughing while Ron gave him some pats on his back, still staring at me."Why are we finding it out now?" he sorted his eyes to Ginny, who shrugged, amused."It's not my fault that you two don't know Fred enough to have noticed it," she burst, "I've known it since November last year."I looked at her surprised. "Have you?"She nodded, proud."AND WHY YOU DIDN'T TELL US?" Ron freaked out."'Cause I'm not a snitch, and unlike you, you prick, I do know how to keep a secret."Ron snorted again and threw a pillow at his little sister. "Shut up, Ginevra.""Get your head out off your ass for once, Ronald Bilius," she returned it to him even harder, almost making him fall off the bed."Wow - Lilith and Fred hooking up..." Harry murmured, staring at the wall, gobsmacked. "I think now nothing can catch me by surprise."✵ ✵ ✵By evening, after enjoying all morning and midday with those three really entertained, Fred and the rest of the lot arrived at my room giggling, followed by Remus."S'up? Did you have fun?" I asked, smiling at the four of them."Yeah, it was nice," Pauline said, wiping off a little tear from her eyes because of how much she had been laughing."We went to a pub in the nearest village and had a couple of beers," Liv added, looking at her girl with dreamy eyes."You would have loved it, mate. We really missed you lots." George finished."Aw, I've missed you too, Georgie. But your siblings and Harry were great company too. Had a really good time with 'em.""How have you been? Do you need anything?" Fred intervened, approaching the bed and putting his hands in the pockets of his jacket."I'm a'right.""We found a full-body mirror, it's in the bathroom near my parents' dorm. Would you like to change the bandages there?""Sure."Remus and Fred helped me to stand up, putting each of my arms around their shoulders to let me use them as my support to walk. Being followed by the other three, we ended up inside the loo."George, you mind bringing me the first-aid kit from my room, please? I forgot it." Fred asked his twin before pulling my shirt off. It wasn't as if I had to get completely naked to change the bandages, in fact, I only needed to be in my underwear, but having so many people looking at me at once, made me feel a bit nervous and I thanked that Fred had noticed it. "Liv, you know where the meds that Tonks bought are?""Yes, I'll get them," the blonde immediately replied, interlacing her hand with Pauline's, getting out together."Fine, dear, let's have a look at these wounds." Remus sighed, trying to give me his most comforting smile. "Ready?"I nodded and while letting me observe my body in front of the mirror, the two of them started to pull off the bandages. I gasped as soon as I saw the first wound and couldn't help but feel how the blood abandoned my face.They were already almost healed but they still had a red and a bit swollen appearance. They looked like Remus's fresh wounds after the full moon.I inspected them, running delicately my fingers through their corners. There weren't as many of them as I thought, but the ones which remained on my skin were quite long and seemed deep enough to remain in the future as scars. Fucking hell. One of them was on my belly, another one around my right thigh, another one crossing from my left shoulder to the centre of my chest, a couple of them on my arms and finally, the trail of a nasty bite on my right shoulder.Focusing more on the mirror, I noticed there was as well another little scratch, the size of a fingernail, right next to my right eye that was already turned into a scar."Oh, Merlin..."I wanted to cry."It's okay, darling. They won't be looking this bad in a couple of days," Fred quickly murmured, watching my devastated expression while caressing my back."If we keep treating them properly, the scars won't be as big as the own wounds," Remus assured, looking at me through the mirror, throwing the dirty bandages away.I gulped hard and ran my eyes from my wounds to Remus's visible ones. It wasn't fair for him - the one who got turned into a werewolf and who had to suffer this sort of wounds and worst ones every month - to have me complaining about something that wasn't even that bad."Well, they don't look that bad thanks to your cares. And they make me look meaner, don't they?." I replied, forcing myself to smile and feeling more confident after interiorizing their words. "Besides, now we do look like father and daughter, don't we?" I looked at Remus who gave me a big smile, calmer."We certainly do," he whispered, leaving a short kiss on my forehead.George knocked on the door and opened it slightly to sneak his hand with the clean bandages. Fred thanked him and quickly started to cover the wounds. I let out a little huff when my skin felt quite squeezed by the fabric."We will be able to take them out in a couple of days. Just wanna make sure they don't get infected while they heal properly," Fred whispered, helping me to put on his clean clothes."Thank you, you two," I hugged him tightly to then let them guide me back to the dorm.After having dinner and receiving a lot of advice from Mrs Weasley, saying goodbye to Ginny, Ron - who had his eyes on Fred and me more than ever - and Harry since soon they would have to go back to Hogwarts, and hugging Remus and Tonks with them promising to visit me as soon as they could, we appeared back in our flat.Being back at home felt relieving, I was tired of being a burden to my friends. Fred let me walk by myself holding on to the walls when I asked him, and slowly, I got into my room where I let myself fall on my comfortable and really missed bed."Sweet home," I whispered, hugging my pillow. Fred snickered and with the sound of George, Pauline and Liv making dinner, he put a vinyl record on the gramophone. The first notes of Let It Be by The Beatles filled the room. Immediately, I started to softly hum."You're enjoying a lot The Beatles lately, aren't you?" Fred said laying on his stomach, in between my legs, letting his face rest on my abdomen carefully as he sneaked his hands below my back to hug me."Well, nothing can go wrong when you're listening to The Beatles," I winked at him, caressing his hair. He closed his eyes and let his cheek rest over my skin."I like that, who said it?""Remus, at his flat. During summer."He snickered, "Should've known."He brought one of his hands to my belly and started to slowly draw little circles with his bare fingertips on my skin, tingling me a little bit."I have to go to the shop tomorrow," Fred started again in a soft whisper. "but I'll be back here to check and entertain you as soon as I get out, a'right? If you want, of course...""Sure, Freddie, obviously I do. But don't tire yourself too much, okay? I'll be fine."He hummed. "It's not tiring, Lilith. I want to take care and cuddle you as much as you let me before you return to the field."I felt the butterflies concentrating in my stomach with so much strength that I thought he would feel them."Besides, we can keep watching those muggle things in your telly with popcorn," he looked back at me, melting me with those brown eyes full of light and stars."You mean 'films'?"He huffed, rolling his eyes with a big smile."Yeah, that."I couldn't help but giggle and caress his hair and cheek even more affectionately."Sure, Freddie." 

During the rest of the days, while my body was healing, I received a lot of visits at home. Liv and Pauline kept taking care of me, George visited me every once in a while to make sure I was doing okay, the entire Harpies team came together to hype me up and tell me how much they had missed me and how needed I was in the team —  Khaleelah and Aileen spent a little more time with me since they were the ones I had the biggest bond with —, Remus visited every two days to bring me my medicines and to examine the scars and Fred came every single day after work to entertain me and to spend time with me. Most of the time, we were watching different films and I took my time to teach the ginger a bit of muggle culture. Luckily for me, I didn't feel pain anymore and I really wanted to be closer to him."Morning, mate!" Tonks burst into my room, making me get out of my daydream. She threw herself to my bed, handing me a bag that carried a couple of beers. "How's it going?""A bit bored but it's okay, what about you?""Came exactly for that, need to tell you something," she said, more serious than usual. "But, go on, have a beer — shit, hang on, you're still on meds, aren't you? Maybe I shouldn't have brought them...""Nah, it's fine. I only take them once a week and already had them on Monday, just—""Don't tell Remus," we said at the same time and then burst into giggles. She opened the beer with her keys and handed me mine, after a long sip, she sighed."What's going on, Dora?""It's exactly because of Remus that I came to talk with you," for the first time, it seemed that she couldn't find the right words. "You already know I have feelings for him and I genuinely think he feels something for me too. It's just that I keep thinking he tries to put distance between us."I took a deep breath and processed her words. I already knew Remus was the reason Dora was trying to act — in her opinion — maturer and even though I didn't agree about her changing her personality for him, I also knew she really felt way more for him than simple friendship affection."You already know him, he feels he's stealing your youth by being with you and he's afraid you might think he is using you to forget Sirius.""But I do know that his relationship with Sirius was a thing and ours is another! I know he is not using me and he isn't stealing shit, I chose to be with him! Ugh, why can't he just listen to me?""He's fucking stubborn and, keep in mind that even though he tries to keep living his life, he has a lot of things in his mind that consume him horribly," I gave a sip to my beer. "I won't excuse him, though, but I think this is being a hard time for all of us, don't you think?"She nodded, being understanding."But listen to me, Dora, don't you dare to change the way you are because of Remus or any other person, do you hear me? If you want to change the way you look that's up to you but if you lose yourself, you lose everything, and you are too worthy for that shit."Tonks giggled and hugged me tightly, still making sure not to hurt me."Thank you so much, you do know how to listen.""Nothing to thank for, mate. And it's what comes when you help Liv to study for her Psychology exams, you end up learning a bit as well."✵ ✵ ✵"You will be fine?" Pauline asked me, putting on her jacket while Liv grabbed her keys."Yes. Besides, Fred will come in a bit," I replied, checking the clock hanging on the wall. The couple were invited to hang out for dinner with Pauline's muggle mates from her university and at first, they tried to refuse the invitation alleging having to take care of me but I convinced them to change their opinion. I didn't want my friends to miss the fun because of me, especially when I was feeling much better and I could already move on my own, freely. For Merlin's sake, if they didn't trust me to stay at home alone, how would I go back to the field next week?"We will be back at home by midnight," Liv smiled at me. "Oh, and remember next week Bill Weasley and Fleur are coming to visit. Fleur wants to meet you, and she has some things to talk about the wedding with Lin, you know she's helping them to plan it.""Take your time," I murmured, smirking. "I might try to reward Freddie for how much he took care of me.""Make sure he doesn't cum on my sofa, I don't want his babies on my leather," Liv warned, pointing at me. I choke with my juice and Pauline gasped, trying to hold back her laugh."Chérie! ""Off you go you two!" I managed to say, still coughing. Both of them snickered and when they were about to set a foot out of the flat, Fred appeared at the door."Night, girls. Going out for a date?" he grinned, entering the place. When he saw me still coughing, he frowned his eyebrows without erasing his smile."Sort of, we're going out for dinner with some mates, see you two later," Pauline replied, interlacing her hand with Liv's."Hang on, why did you do to Lilith, Olivia?" He asked, arching one of his eyebrows, interested."It wasn't me, it was the Nargles!" she said, already going downstairs."Sure, Lovegood!" Fred chuckled, sarcastic while moving his wand to close the door.The ginger's eyes finally focused on me, stirring every part on my inside. He was incredibly handsome; his ginger hair looking messily impeccable, giving him a casual but wild look at the same time, his stare shined with his typical mischievous bright, he was wearing one of his many suits that wrapped around his svelte body madly good, the little moles and freckles in his face looking like little stars and galaxies spread and painted all over his skin. Fuck, I wanted him. I wanted him so badly."Good night, Freddie," I smiled at him, playing a little bit with one of my curls."Hello, beautiful," he walked towards me, sitting by my side on the couch, I quickly put my legs over his and he immediately started caressing them, giving quivers all over my body at the only feeling of his hands touching my naked skin. Since when was I so needy of him?"Tough day at work?"He shrugged, laying back on the couch, spreading his legs and using his arm as a pillow, exposing his neck and his god-like profile. Shit, am I drooling too much?"Bearable. What about you? Bored without me?""Nah, had Tonks's company.""Nice, what film are we watching today?" he murmured while sighing making his voice sound raspy, deep and slightly sexual. Breathe, Lilith, breathe.I had to force myself to take my eyes off him. "The Lion King. From 1994.""Another cartoon film? Great!" he burst, excited. It turned out that Fred's inner child was still pretty much alive after he loved watching together some of Hermione's favourite films.The movie started playing and while Fred was almost absorbed watching it and eating his popcorn, once again I couldn't take my eyes off him. His jawline was sharper and his lips redder than usual, I bit my lower one at the view of him.Fuck, I can't hold myself anymore.I approached him even more and placed my lips on the warm and sensitive skin of his neck, starting to slowly and intensely kiss him. He took a deep breath, slightly tilting his head back, giving me more access, and stroking my legs. I put my hand on his neck to pull him even closer and sucked and bit his skin leaving beautiful love marks on it. He panted when I moved my lips to his jawline and moved his head to make our mouth's met.I couldn't help but bite his lower lip as his tongue played with mine in a slow and burning kiss."Mmmh, someone's a bit needy," he scoffed against my lips."Shut up and kiss me," I murmured, out of breath, staring deeply into his eyes to then put my hands on his hair and drag him back to me.His lips moved fiercely and demanding against mine, as his hands travelled to my waist to pull me closer to him. Our bodies were reacting to each other as if we were melting together into a bonfire after so many weeks and days without releasing our desire. Our breathings were already heavy and Fred's mouth moved to kiss my jawline and my neck as I moved to straddle him. I rocked my hips slowly, grinding against him, and he panted against my skin. He separated a little bit to connect our looks and going back to kiss me but when he was about to fuse again his lips with mine, he froze. Fred swallowed hard and caressed softly the tiny scar next to my eye."No, darling, we can't do this," he murmured, softly putting me off his lap.I observed him, perplexed."Why, Freddie?""I don't think it's the best moment," he simply said, giving me a comforting smile and caressing my hand, trying to go back to the film."Oh," I muttered, a bit surprised. "Okay." I couldn't even blink. He rejected me, for the first time since we started this weird thing, he rejected me. A not so hare-brained idea crossed my mind and I felt myself swallowing hard at the question that I was about to form; "Can I ask you a question?" I whispered, almost unable to speak. "Is it because of the scars? Do they disgust you?" I didn't want to pressure him nor make him feel bad for not wanting to have sex, as he obviously was in his right to, but that was a possibility that had been roaming my mind for a while. He stared at me with his eyes opened widely as if I had said the most bizarre and stupid words in the world. "Disgust? Lilith — of course not! What makes you think that?" "Maybe you find them unattractive," I replied sincerely but with my heart pounding inside my chest. My voice slightly trembled. "Freddie, if you...if you don't desire me anymore — you can say it. I promise you I won't get mad and our friendship will continue as normal. But please, tell me, I want you to be honest. I know the scars are too big, and I like them but maybe you—" He blinked, astonished, and shook his head. "Oh, fuck," he chuckled, ironic and passed his arm around my waist to glue me to his chest. His voice sounding deeper and drier. "I don't desire you, Lilith, I fucking crave you. With every single fibre in my body. You are deeply rooted under my skin and be sure that if someone in this world wants to fuck you and pamper you like no one else, that's me, understood?" "Then what happened, darling?" I asked, making a little pout. "Is it because you are too tired from work?" He huffed, ironic, arching one of his eyebrows to then look at me, more piercing and intense than before. "Who said I don't want to fuck you right now? What I don't want is to hurt you, darling." "But I'm okay! All of you keep treating me as if I was still on the brink of death and I'm really thankful for all your cares and how all of you are worried about me, but it's been a month and I'm not a baby, I'm alright." He clicked his tongue. "You say you're not a baby but you behave like a fucking spoilt brat. I know you don't like being so dependent and that you think you are already healed, but the damage was incredibly severe, Lilith. You didn't see yourself as I did." I nodded and moved from his grip, sitting back and playing with my nails. Maybe I was being too childish. "Okay, I understand, I'm so sorry, darling. You are right." I said softly and focused again on the movie, which was already almost finishing. I heard Fred clicking his tongue and, surprising me, he grabbed my neck carefully and made me lay on my back, positioning slightly on top of me. "I know you want us to be together again and, believe me, darling, I do too. So fucking much. You can't really imagine how much. That's why I stopped you because I know the moment I'm back in between your legs I won't be able to go soft or to control myself and the last thing I want is to hurt you."I sighed, processing his words and finally nodded. He smiled at me and rubbed his nose with mine. Before I could react, he sneaked his hand inside my trousers and my knickers, and placed his fingers right there, caressing me completely. A surprised and high-pitched moan escaped from my lips and he bit my lower lip slowly, still smirking."Fuck, Freddie..."I slightly whined, moving my hips, eager for him."Let's wait until the day you come back from the field with the Harpies to see if your body still hurts or not, okay?" he murmured with a deep voice, caressing my clit and almost grazing his lips with mine. "And I will fuck this pussy until you can't count how many times we both cum, a'right, angel?""Y-yes," I managed to whisper, tilting my head back at the dim movement of his warm hand."Yes, what?""You haven't forgotten that, have you?" I smirked at him and gave him my most feline and devilish look. He arched one of his eyebrows, waiting for my answer and I rolled my eyes, turned on and amused."Yes, daddy.""That's my good girl," he murmured to then slamming his lips against mine, claiming of me as much as he could. I moaned and whimpered against him, feeling his touch burning and consuming me...until he suddenly took his hand from me and put it on my hip to hold me still while his other hand continued on my neck, all the time being extremely careful. "But for now, darling, you're gonna stay here nice and calm."I made a little noise complaining."I would have eaten you out but you decided to behave like a brat," he teased me and I couldn't help but snicker."Oh, Freddie, I will have my revenge for this," I winked at him and he smirked again."Can't wait to see that."

A couple of days after, Fred kept coming every day after work to spend some time with me but even though I was still eager for him, I didn't try anything again.On Sunday morning, I was sitting in Liv's and Pauline's bed, helping the French girl to study some of her notes for the exam she had the next morning. She was putting a lot of effort, more than the average student, since she had to match her muggle political subjects with the ones added for wizard students and the little struggles she still had with the language. Since Liv was also focused on her exams, I offered myself to help her to translate anything she needed and help her to memorise the theory."Fine, I think it's enough for today," Pauline finally sighed after a couple of hours of work. She tied up her beautiful braids in a bun, taking off her glasses as well and rubbing her hands through her tired face."You're gonna nail it. You'll see," I encouraged her, feeling incredibly proud of my friend. She smiled and laid down on her bed, giving a sip of her coffee."Oh, by the way, Fleur is coming in half an hour or so, Bill probably will come later too after visiting the twins, you don't mind, right?""Of course not! I really want to meet her, never got the chance at Hogwarts.""Great, 'cause she's feeling a bit lonely here in England," Pauline tightened her lips, "Bill's family aren't treating her too well.""Really?" I said, surprised, especially since Liv told me that Fleur was incredibly nice."Yeah, especially Mrs Weasley.""Oh, yes, she's a bit complicated. Know it from first hand."We got out of the room and Liv picked up her notes from the couch to then start preparing some crumpets and biscuits while I made tea enough for us and our guests. We were so entertained talking and listening to music in the kitchen that we almost didn't notice when someone knocked at the door. Pauline ran to open and soon a melodic and soft voice with a strong French accent could be heard.Soon, a gorgeous girl appeared at the kitchen's door. She was of long and silky platinum blonde hair with deep blue eyes and fairy-like features. Fleur Delacour possessed that kind of beauty that carried ancient and hypnotic magic in it and even though I knew she was part Veela, seeing her close for the first time, I couldn't help but feel a little bit mesmerised.When her eyes focused on me and Liv, a kind smile appeared on her face and Olivia quickly went to greet her and hug her."Welcome! So happy to have you here! Look, this is my friend Lilith, remember I talked to you about her?"I gave her my kindest smile and waved at her while cleaning my hands after grabbing a piece of one of Liv's biscuits."Thank you so much, Olivia. And yes, hello, is really nice to finally meet you," Fleur spoke, looking at me. Her accent was really strong, her 'r's sounded like 'g's and her voice was pretty nasal but still, I found it quite beautiful, just like Pauline's."Nice to meet you too, Fleur! Pauline and Liv talked to me a lot about you."We guided her to the couch and after serving us a good cup of tea, we started chatting as if we were just a normal group of friends which wasn't surprising since Fleur was only a couple of months older than me."So how are you doing with Bill's family? Pauline said they aren't being too kind to you," I spoke, carefully. The three of us paid full attention to the girl, who sighed a bit tired."I'm doing my best. I really am, I ignore their comments, I try to be as nice as possible and to help at home but... it's not working. They mess with me because of my English or my accent, but what offends me the most is Mrs Weasley thinking I'm only with Bill because of the interest. As if I was some kind of gold-digger!"I clicked my tongue in disapproval and tutted."I'm really sorry. They can be really complicated when they want to.""Oui, Pauline said you struggled a bit with her too, right? Because of Fred?"I moved in my seat a bit uncomfortable at the memories."Yes, I'm not dating Fred, though. But because of what my mother did to her family, she wasn't kind to me at all.""The woman had the audacity to say that Lilith is just like Circe," Liv snorted, annoyed."And what does Bill say about it?" Pauline asked, curious."He can't do much. He tries to calm things but at the end of the day, the worst ones are Ginny and Mrs Weasley, and they are his little sister and mum," she replied, quite sad."Well, forgive me, but that doesn't excuse him. Maybe I still have to pay some respect to Mrs Weasley but I will give a piece of my mind to Ginny and Hermione if I have to, and don't get me started on Fred!" I couldn't help but say."Oh, no, no! The twins and Ron are the softest ones. They only make some comments about my accent. The only one who hasn't said a word is Charlie and it's because he is not even in the country.""Only? Oh, mate," I tutted. "They shouldn't be saying anything, for fuck's sake."Pauline and Liv nodded agreeing with me."Listen, the best thing you could do is talking to Bill about this, setting things clear and telling him how bad this situation makes you feel. Fleur, he is your fiancé! He has to do something!" I advised her. "And be sure I will have a conversation with Fred and George about this!"She smiled, thanking me and we changed the topic to make sure she was comfortable at least around us. We talked about my Quidditch practices, about Liv and Pauline's universities and Fleur's work at Gringotts.After a while, someone knocked at the door again. This time, I stood up to open. Behind the door, I found four men. First of all, a tall and thin man, with long ginger hair tied in a ponytail, a fang hanging from his ear as an earring and really cool clothes that I would have loved to have in my wardrobe. He was pretty attractive, as every Weasley. By his side, Remus was smiling at me with a couple of bags in his hands, and behind the two of them, the smiley twins."Oh, hello!" I greeted them, surprised at Remus's presence. "You must be Bill Weasley, come in, come in."George was the first one to enter, messing my hair and passing quickly in front of me, straight to throw himself on my couch."S'up, Lilith?" he said, getting comfortable."Boots off my sofa, Georgie!""How's it going, dear?" Remus didn't wait to walk in and give me a little kiss on my forehead."Really well," I smiled at him."And you must be Lilith, right?" the oldest of the Weasleys said, giving me a kind smile."That's me.""Oh, really nice to finally meet you! My brother talked a lot about you," Bill Weasley spoke without erasing his smile."Shut up, William," Fred complained, slightly pushing his brother's shoulder with his own, making both of us giggle. Bill followed the other twin and sat next to Fleur, really close to her."Evening, darling," Fred spoke, calling my attention and giving me his characteristic mischievous smirk.I smiled cynic at him and grabbed the collar of his shirt dragging him discreetly close to my face."If I ever hear again that you or your twin mess with Fleur's accent or anything related to her, I'm kicking both of your asses back to the Burrow and you won't be having sex with me for the rest of the year, are we clear?" I mumbled without erasing the cynic smile as he looked at me first astonished and then proud."Clear.""Great. Now, good evening, Freddie."He walked to reunite with the whole group and let himself fall over my couch with grace next to his twin, putting his arms behind his head and using them as a pillow."What've you been up to, ladies?" Fred asked, stretching a little bit after the long day of work."We've been chatting a little bit," Liv replied. "Remus, may I ask what you've got there?""Dinner!" the man quickly said, "I wanted to surprise Lilith with some food from her favourite restaurant in London and luckily for me, I was smart enough to bring food for all of us.""Oh, great, I'm starving!" George replied, fanning himself."You guys are staying, right?" Pauline asked the couple, who looked at each other."Well, if we aren't bothering..." Bill replied, but I interrupted him."Of course you aren't bothering! Please, get yourselves comfortable.""Thanks, beautiful, but we are already comfortable," Fred said behind me George nodded."I'm not talking to you, I know you and your twin don't need me saying that for you two to get comfortable in here. This is more your flat than mine by now.""And you love it," they both said arrogantly, making us giggle."Maybe, but don't get too excited."Remus put out all the food — he genuinely had brought a lot of it — and soon we started chatting again. Bill Weasley turned out to be quite funny and gentle but way more reserved than his extravagant brothers."Lilith, I heard you're a Harpie but after that...ugly accident you had, "Bill talked to me, choosing carefully his words, "you had to stop playing, you know when you're going back?"I noticed how Fred was looking at me from the corner of his eye, smirking. He was probably remembering that deal we had got to."Yeah, next week I'm back with the training!" I replied, pretty proud."That's great!" Fleur smiled."We were planning to accompany her, do you wanna come?" Pauline said to her friend."I'd really like to see you again, and besides later we can go to a pub with the rest of my team," I encouraged her, after seeing how she hesitated."I'd love it," Fleur finally said.While the rest kept talking, I felt Remus's knee hitting mine."Dear, can I have a word with you at the kitchen?" he said in a soft murmur."Sure," I followed him and he slightly closed the door behind us to give us more privacy."What did you want to talk about?" I asked, crossing my arms, curious."I have a letter for you," he said, after sighing, handing me the piece of paper."From whom?""Draco.""What? Why didn't he send it straight to me?" I asked confused, opening the envelope."He didn't send it by himself, apparently, they have taken his owl away from him. His aunt doesn't want him to communicate out of their fucking psychopath circle."I couldn't help but snort frustrated. My poor Draco..."Hang on, how did you get it then?""Your uncle sent it to me," Remus replied after a while of hesitation.I felt the blood going cold in my veins. "He can't communicate with me yet, can he?" I said in a soft whisper.These few months felt quite weird without knowing at least something about Severus. And, definitely, it was the largest period of time I ever spent without talking to him.I didn't know if I missed him or it was just getting out of my comfort zone.Remus shook his head, "No, dear, I'm sorry.""It's okay. I'm used not to be between his priorities.""Don't say that, love. He might not be the perfect uncle, actually, he is really far away from it," he clarified, "but at the end of the day, he loves you in his way and he has taken care of you."That was quite true, without Severus, probably I wouldn't even be alive. Which made me think, was I being too harsh with him asking him for more?I took a deep breath and finally opened Draco's letter, feeling incredibly nostalgic at the view of his fancy and perfectly executed handwriting.

Dear Lilith;

I'm afraid this might be one of my last letters to you this year. Bellatrix discovered I was getting and sending mail and since I refused to tell her from whom, she has taken my owl away from me and I don't fully trust Snape to give him these letters. However, the moment I knew you were hurt, I simply couldn't not write to you. I'm terribly sorry, sister. Terribly. Your mother gave me a fully detailed discourse about how she got her disgusting revenge over you and I have to tell you I almost vomited and had the urge to curse her aloud. She also told me — quite annoyed — that both Lupin and the unbearable carrot Weasley took you out of there before she could finish her revenge. I'm really happy to hear that and I hope that they are healing you and treating you as good as you deserve. Wish I could have been there with you.Before you ask me, no, I still cannot tell you what they have ordered me to do and to protect you even more —especially now that you were hurt — I will have to ask you, much to my dismay, to stop sending me letters, even though I really want to keep in touch with you and I miss you terribly.

I'm as okay as I could be in this situation so don't worry about me, your uncle keeps an eye on me and I have made a new friend ( I know, I know, quite surprising), her name is Myrtle. Maybe you happen to know her.

Loving you, missing you and hoping you are okay.

- Draco L. Malfoy

Oh, my boy... He couldn't even imagine how much I missed him and how much I wanted to protect him, even though I knew I couldn't do anything to help him because of the unknowledge of his mission and the unknown enchantment he had put on me that was still working. I pressed the note against my chest and made sure to treasure it as much as I could.Remus clicked his tongue when he saw my sad face and immediately hugged me in between his arms."Don't worry, dear. You'll see he will be okay, Narcissa will take care of him and he's a strong boy.""I know, and I have all my faith in him. But I wish I could do more to help him..."✵ ✵ ✵Three days later, with just one day before going back to the field and after uselessly thinking about Draco, I decided I couldn't torture my mind anymore. I needed to free that stress that was consuming me.After talking to George, Liv and Pauline, they agreed with me to give Fred a little surprise at his flat. The ginger managed to sneak from work to give me his keys, which opened the window of Fred's room so I could get in there. George winked at me and made sure to distract his twin and to spend the rest of the night with my two friends.I rambled through Fred's dorm, waiting for him, without turning the light on since the night sky was illuminating enough. It was quite big and cosy and smelled just like him. My eyes focused everywhere and I couldn't help but freeze when I saw the framed picture on his nightstand. Without daring to touch it, I felt my breathing going heavy. It was our polaroid. The one he took during his birthday at the Astronomy tower.He kept it. And he even framed it! To have it over his nightstand!Before I could keep thinking about it, the door opened, making me turn around and sit on the bed, quite surprised.Fred entered the room with a little smile on his face, the fierceness and mischief shining in his eyes and putting his hands in his hips."Well, well, well, what do we have here?" he ironically asked with a deep voice. "What are you doing in here, beautiful?""I was waiting for you," I finally dared to murmur after a couple of seconds that felt like an eternity."Oh, really? And why so?" he slowly approached. "Thought we would see at your place like always. Was really surprised when Liv told me you'd be here."A feline smile slowly covered my face."Thought I could give you a little surprise," I whispered, playing with the end of my short skirt, crossing my legs to expose more their naked skin. Fred's look went straight to them to slowly cover them as he took a deep breath. His eyes went back to mine and he arched his eyebrows without erasing that dim smile."A little surprise, huh? Didn't we agree to wait until tomorrow after the training?" he asked, kneeling in front of me and putting his hands over my knees, burning me with his warm touch.Bloody hell, I was so fucking needy of him."Maybe...""Then, why do you come to my room, with this short skirt that you know I fucking love and it tempts me so fucking much, disobeying me?" Fred drawled, touching the end of the fabric, grazing with his fingers my thighs and staring at me straight into the eye.I took a deep breath and smirked at him arching one of my eyebrows."Since when do I obey you, Freddie?" I tempted him, coming closer to his face. He licked his lips when his eyes focused on mine, slowly, making me crave to kiss him."Since you are my beautiful good girl..." he whispered, to then start spreading slow and little kisses all over my neck, making me tilt my head back and close my eyes. Fuck, I wanted him so badly. "Listen, there's nothing in this world that I want more at this moment than pinning you against this bed and fuck you until you are incredibly ruined, but today, darling, we can sleep together in my bed, hugging each other and chatting as usual. Then, tomorrow after the training, you will get both your reward and your punishment for being such a brat."I clicked my tongue complaining and moving away from him. I stood up and sat again in his chest of drawers, leaving my legs slightly open and watching how his chest went harshly up and down at the view of my — now more exposed — body."What if I tell you I need you now, Freddie? That I want you now," I murmured softly and innocently, staring at him as I slowly opened my legs more. He tilted his head back, closing his eyes and running his hands through his face and his hair."You aren't making this easy for me, Lilith," Fred whispered, quite out of breath."Then don't make it so hard for me, Freddie," I replied, smiling.Come play with me, love.

Fred arched one of his eyebrows, eyes piercing on me and hands on his hips. The ambience of the room felt heavy because of all the sexual tension restrained and the only sound audible was our own breathing."Lilith," he started, trying to reason with me, "I don't want to hurt you."I rolled my eyes with a little smile on my face and leaned on my hands to leave my body more exposed."C'mon, Freddie, don't tell me you're getting old..." I teased him in a low murmur, watching his eyes darkening and his breathing turning deeper. "I mean, if you really don't want to it's okay, of course. I just thought we could overtake our encounter.""Old?" he chuckled, ironic, slowly approaching me. Like a lion hunting its prey. "I might be getting old, but what about you, Lilith? Since I started fucking you, you have become a little needy slut. And it's not about not wanting to fuck you, love, it's about you being a disobedient brat, as usual."The moonlight illuminated his back, creating shadows in his perfect face that made him look meaner and maturer. I felt myself drooling at him when he bit his lip while his hand gripped my neck, putting my face closer to his. His dark brown eyes quickly went down to my lips and he pressed tighter."And how do you know I haven't been always like this, huh?"His smile turned more mischievous and his eyes shined with desire as I grazed my lips with his."Because I know no one has ever fucked you as I did," Fred whispered, sneaking his hands below my shirt and starting to caress my waist, my back and under my breasts, melting me into his burning touch. "Because you are daddy's good girl. My good girl."I grabbed the collar of his shirt, desperate already to feel him again, and fused the two of us into an intense and ruining kiss. His lips demanding mine, claiming me and trying to take the dominance as one of his hands went back to my neck, gaining a soft moan from my lips that got drowned in his. Before I could even try to take off his clothes, his other hand sneaked again, but this time, inside my underwear."Mmmh, you are soaked, darling," he arrogantly murmured against my lips. "How can I say no to you when your perfect pussy is practically drooling for me?"I let my lips go down all over his neck, kissing, biting and sucking, making him moan really softly as music to my ears, to then sneak my hand inside his trousers and boxers, feeling his hard dick almost throbbing against my hand."Let's not act as if you aren't almost dying to fuck me too, Freddie. A couple of kisses more and you would be bursting in your trousers. What a beautiful view that would be," I whispered.The ginger took a deep breath, staring at me with a wide smile, erratic breathing and messed hair, He tilted his head back opening more his mouth when I caressed him and let out a lovely raspy moan that sent quivers straight to my clit."Fuck! -" Fred whispered, a bit out of breath, taking my hand off him and his of me, unbuttoning his trousers and freeing his big erection. He grabbed my thighs and pulled me closer to him, already letting me feel his tip rubbing against my wetness, teasing me. "You wanted me to fuck you and here you have me, as desperate as always to be buried inside of you."I only could put my arms over his shoulders when Fred lifted my skirt up in a rush and pulled down my knickers, to then put my thighs around his hips and grab his dick. His eyes wandered all over my body and he seemed to briefly recover the good sense when he saw the scar in my leg. He stared at it for a couple of seconds, hesitating. "Freddie? Are you okay?" I asked, genuinely worried. "We can stop if you-""I don't want to stop, darling," He interrupted me and trapped my lips into his and starting to push inside of me, torturously slow and careful. My eyes met his and a devilish idea crossed my mind."Are you in, Freddie?" I teased him, trying to hold back the moan that threatened to leave my throat at the feeling of being filled by him again.He looked at me almost offended and the grip of his hands on my hips became harder."Oh, you little teaser," Fred mumbled to then thrust into me harder, getting all his length inside of me and making me gasp and moan. Damn, it felt too good. He hissed with his hand again in my neck and staring right there where our bodies connected. "Fuck, you can't imagine how I missed your pussy practically sucking me in, darling. Can't count the number of times I wanked thinking about you during these weeks, but my hand never felt as good as you. No, not even close," he pushed again, making me slightly tremble in between his arms."Oh, Freddie!" I grabbed his hair and pressed his forehead with mine, trying to catch as much air as possible, his hand surrounded my waist while the other kept grabbing my thigh, making me lean a little bit more to thrust even deeper into me and reach parts inside of me that I thought them to be unreachable.He gripped my neck making me stare at him straight into his eyes as he kept pounding in me."Blueberry?" he asked a worried, with his voice raspy and low.I smirked, "No, keep going."He smiled arrogantly and nodded.Fred made me take off my shirt, almost tearing it, and quickly got rid of my bra as well, going straight to my nipple and letting his tongue play with my piercings as his hips kept crashing into mine and his dick kept hitting my weakest spot, I felt myself almost exploding.His mouth left claiming kisses and soft bites all over my breasts and neck, driving me closer and closer to the edge. "Mine," Fred mumbled against my skin. "Fucking mine."He kept pounding into me and I thought I would collapse and break into his arms. Fred quickly noticed how close I was when I kept clenching around him, making him groan pleased."Cum around me, angel. Let daddy feel you completely," he panted, digging his fingers in my hips."Fuck, Fred!" I cried out, feeling at the peak of the rollercoaster. He hit rougher, rocking his hips. He was the sweetest venom to ever exist, the poison I needed to live."You know how I like you to call me when I fuck you, love. Say it for me."I licked my lips staring at him, eager, while his thumb went straight to draw slow and torturing circles over my swollen clit, hurrying up the way into my orgasm."Daddy!" I burst clenching around him with a loud moan rasping my throat, my eyes closing unwillingly and feeling every nerve in my body exploding with pleasure as the fireworks blowing up in my veins."That's my good girl," he proudly snarled, pounding harder inside of me, looking for his own relief. "Fuck, always feeling so madly good."He tilted his head back again, closing his eyes harshly, red cheeks, lips half-open, erratic breathing and dick throbbing and pulsating inside of me. What a sinfully heavenly view.Instead of coming inside of me, as he used to do, he pulled out and started stroking himself fast."On your knees," Fred demanded me in an out-of-breath murmured. I obeyed, arching one of my eyebrows and quickly opened my mouth, sticking out my tongue and with my lower lip grazing his tip as I made sure to keep eye contact with him all the time."Oh, f-fuck, Lilith!" he let out, panting, as he started to release himself on my mouth, I waited for him to finish, staring at him with an amused and feline look to then swallow all of it.Trying to normalise his breathing again, he looked at me and lifted my chin, making me stand up again even though my legs felt numb. Before I could say a word, he slammed his lips against mine, letting me feel his addicting flavour and claiming me as his once again while he pulled down my skirt."On the bed, angel. I'm gonna please you properly," he whispered against my lips, slapping my bum.I let myself fall over the bed with a little smile that I was uselessly trying to hold. Under his intense eyes and amused smile, I spread my legs and let my hands travel all over my body.Fred's piercing stare covered me from up to down."Have I ever told you you are bloody gorgeous?""Every time we fuck," I snickered, watching him get on his knees and observe every part of my body as if I was the most tempting fruit to ever exist."Then I don't say it enough," Fred grabbed my legs and dragged me closer to him, his breath against my wetness. "You are so fucking beautiful, angel," he whispered, starting to slowly kiss and suck my inner thighs.I felt the tingles concentrating in my pussy and all I wanted was to grab his hair and put his mouth over me once and for all.His eyes met mine for a brief second and with a little smile and a mischievous bright in his eyes, he slowly and arrogantly passed his tongue from my entrance to my clit, drawing little circles in it as his fingers did before. A loud moan escaped my lips and I had to clap my mouth to hold back a whimper. Fuck, I had forgotten how good this felt."You can't even imagine how much I love to eat your pussy, Lilith," he smiled to then suck my clit, making me pant, and grabbing my thighs to stop me from closing my legs, giving slow and intense passes with his tongue, driving me crazy. "You taste so bloody good...if only you could see yourself right now, so ruined and turned into a mess. Only for me."I gasped and let out a little whine when two of his fingers sunk inside of me, twisting and overstimulating me even more."Fuck, Freddie!" I couldn't help but moan, out of breath, closing my eyes and feeling him drinking off me like a thirsty animal, kissing me down there as if he wanted to take as much of me as he could. "I've missed you fucking much!""Weren't your fingers enough to please you, darling?" he teased me, to then give slow and lazy licks to my clit, still thrusting with his fingers inside of me and with his lips soaked of my wetness."N-no, nothing feels l-like you," I whimpered when he started sucking again, sending quivers all over my body and making me feel as if my veins had been set on fire.He smiled proudly and rubbed his tongue against my swollen clit, twisting his fingers and making me tremble with pure pleasure."And to think that I felt guilty for waking up hard every time we slept together..." he snickered. Fred pulled out his fingers and after sucking them under my amazed and shiny eyes, he smirked and grabbed my thighs to put them at each side of his face and lick my entire pussy, kissing me and teasing my entrance with his tongue. I was reaching fucking heaven with this man. "And look at you now, you couldn't wait to be moaning like a little whore under me. How pretty."He made sure to keep my legs like that, digging his fingers in my thighs as the contact of his mouth on me became closer and deeper and his tongue kept playing with me, already driving me to the climax of my own overstimulation."Freddie...I-I'm going t-to...cum!" I whimpered, writhing under him uselessly since he was holding my hips still. To tempt me even more, Fred started to flick his tongue on my clit faster, sucking even deeper and drinking all of me, gaining a loud raspy moan from me."Cum all over daddy's face, angel. Let me savour you," he whispered.I exploded once again into a pleasant orgasm that sent currents all over my body, making me tremble and roll back my eyes, full of pleasure. I felt my juices coming slowly out of me as Fred licked them, letting out a satisfied snarl and muffled moan when I moved my hips, rubbing myself against his face. I felt my mind going blank and every single part of my body reaching a delicious climax."What a good girl my precious brat is..." Fred murmured, proud, to then drink the last trails of my orgasm, making me tremble because of the overstimulation. "I'm not done with you, darling. You wanted to be fucked and I'm going to do so."He stood up and quickly got rid of all his clothes, showing off that god-like body he had, making me drool again for him, eager and still wet. His dick was incredibly hard and almost throbbing, with the tip redder than usual, claiming attention. His abs slightly sweaty and his chest going violently up and down as he ran his hand over his hair. Kneeling on the bed again, he spread my legs and slithered between them, grazing his dick with my wetness. Before letting me say a word, he caught my face in between his hand, making me open my mouth and spitting there to let me taste my own flavour in his saliva and then slammed his lips against mine again. Fuck, he was going to end me.His hands cupped my breasts while I put my hands around his neck, hearing him moan softly and dragging him closer to me, making me struggle to follow his messy kiss as he kept rubbing himself against me."Fuck me, Freddie," I whispered against his lips. He grinned staring at me, arrogantly."Are you begging me, darling?""I'm ordering it to you," I drawled, smirking at him. He imitated my smile and grabbed his dick to rub it even harder against me, a little whine escaped from my lips."You're absolutely soaked again, Lilith, do you think you are in any position to order me?" he scoffed, teasing my entrance."Don't play that much, Freddie. I can feel you throbbing against me," I mumbled, amused, moving my hand down there and running my long nail, slowly and carefully, all over the length of his dick, focusing on his tip and hearing him hiss and tremble.He couldn't help but moan really softly, then gripped my wrist to put my hand away from him and put his tip already in my entrance. "My beautiful slut loves to tease me, don't you, darling?"I arched one of my eyebrows and smiled at him challenging and moving my hips against his. He huffed harshly and without restraining himself anymore, Fred grabbed my hips and pushed into me in a single hard thrust that made me moan louder than what I wanted.He started pounding fast, ruining me so bloody good. Fred spread little and sweet kisses all over my face in contrast with his rough thrusts and the bewitching melody of his hips crashing against mine as our heavy breathing synchronised.Fred thrust harder into me, pushing even deeper and making me whimper under him, digging my nails deep in his back. He hissed full of pleasure."That's it, darling. Mark me," he murmured in a low moan, rocking harder his hips. "Feels so bloody good. Make daddy proud of you, Lilith."I felt my throat sore because of my own moans and Fred hid his face in my neck, pretty out of breath. In a burst of confidence, I turned us around and before Fred could say anything, I put his hands in my hips again and started to go up and down in his dick, feeling it pulsating inside of me, filling me and rubbing harshly my weakest point."Fuuuuuck!" we both moaned at the same time, and I hissed struggling to fit all of Fred inside of me as he helped me rocking slightly his hips, tilting his head back and letting another beautiful moan out. I put my hands over his chest, digging my nails from his collarbones to his hips and making him go in and out of me rougher and harder than before. He stared at me, biting his lip and with the veins in his hands and arms more marked than ever."Oh, Freddie, you feel so fucking good!" I whimpered, putting my hands on my heels to have a better movement of my hips.Fred groaned and grabbed my hips to turn us around again and start thrusting harder into me again."As much as I love it when you ride me, I'm the one fucking you tonight, Lilith," he scoffed, digging his fingers in my hips and pounding rougher and harder, letting his dick throb and pulsate inside of me. I clenched around him and he gasped, pleased.I couldn't let out a single word, his thrusts felt so delicious and he was making me reach climax so fast again, that I only could moan and whimper under him, with my nails deep dug in his back and my legs tangled around his hips."Cum f-for me, darling," he struggled to murmur, whimpering and pushing roughly. I felt my heart at the top of the rollercoaster and soon my whole body trembled in an intense and burning orgasm that made me clench around him and moan aloud, scratching him and with a little tear escaping from my eyes because of the overstimulation and the incredible pleasure I had reached. My body felt like exploding in fireworks and I think I never had been so close to heaven. He tilted his head back at the feeling of my walls clenching around him and my orgasm covering him and finally came inside of me, filling me and letting me enjoy till the last drop of him."Lilith!" he whimpered raspily and deeply, gaining my last moan as I noticed once again how bloody pretty was to see him finish.Fred let himself rest over my body to catch air again, hugging my waist and letting me run my fingers through his ginger hair."Did I hurt you?" he asked in a low whisper, slightly worried.I smiled at him, feeling my heart melting, and shook my head. "No, Freddie, I'm okay."He grinned and started leaving little kisses all over my belly to then rest his face over it, caressing my skin."It's just that I don't think I will be able to walk back to my dorm, honestly," I said, sincere, a bit embarrassed. Fred snickered and pulled out of me to grab some toilet paper and clean me up."You can sleep with me then.""Only sleep," I cleared up, he rolled his eyes, amused."Only sleep," he repeated, "I don't want to tire up my favourite Harpie too much," Fred continued kissing my thighs.We fell asleep in each other's arms, completely satisfied and happy about going back to our routine.My Freddie...The next morning, I woke up early noticing Fred standing up from bed."Morning, beautiful," he said with his sleepy voice, rubbing his face with his hands."Morning," I stretched out, trying to wake up my body. "Where are you going?""Work," he sighed and turned around to grab his clothes before showering. I gasped when I saw his back. It was completely red and full of scratches."Oh, Merlin! Fred, your back!"He scowled, confused, and turned around to look at it through the mirror. Fred snickered as soon as he noticed what I was talking about."Oh, darling, this is your masterpiece," he said proudly, looking at me, quite arrogant."I did that to you?" I asked, surprised."You do this to me every time we fuck.""And you don't care?" I asked. Looking with more detail at them, they were quite beautiful and for some reason, I felt pleased with myself that I was the one marking him like that."Of course not. I love them, they are the trails of you in my body."Oh, Fred...I tried to stand up but my legs failed me, making me sit again. I snorted, annoyed."And that is the trail of me in you," he scoffed, pointing at my trembly legs, amused.I rolled my eyes, "The training is going to fucking hurt.""Hang on," Fred said, grabbing his wand and pointing at me. He mumbled a spell and immediately, I felt my legs stronger. I tried to stand up and this time, they did hold me. I looked at him, amazed."Thanks, Freddie."Hold on a minute..."You're telling you could have fixed my trembly legs every time we fucked before?!"He burst into laughter. "Well, yes, but I loved to see my personal mark on you, darling."Fred winked at me and then got out of the dorm, walking arrogantly and cocky, straight to the shower. I had to bite my lip not to smile.Fuck, this man was going to end me.

The training went surprisingly well, my body still felt slightly numb and sore but I could bear with it and the reward that brought me was a huge reason to keep going. My teammates welcomed me between cheers and joy, having a lot of patience with me and making sure I was doing well all the time. Liv, Pauline and our recent company, Fleur, were hyping me from the terraces."It's great to have you back, Lilith," Khaleelah said, coming straight at me after the training, followed by Aileen, who put her arm over my shoulder. "You are really needed in the team.""Aye, mate," the McDonald girl agreed, "Our matches haven't gone that good since you were gone. We are still top of the classification but you assure us that first place.""Thank you so much, girls. I really missed this lots.""We have planned to go grab some drinks at Diagon Alley, wanna come?" Zahir offered me as we entered the changing room to go back to our normal clothes."Sure, can my friends come?""Obvs.""Mind if Verity comes as well after work?" Aileen burst, with shiny and bright eyes. Her thing with the blonde girl was going really well lately.We ended up at the Leaky Cauldron, at the biggest table where we could fit, talking and chatting calmly with our butterbeer and making sure Fleur, Verity, Liv and Pauline felt included in the team. After a couple of hours, Bill showed up to pick up Fleur and take her back home and we took that as a sign to finally go home since the next day both Lin and Olivia had classes."Oh, Lilith, I almost forgot!" Pauline burst suddenly when we were going upstairs. "You got some mail early in the morning. Left it on the kitchen table for you to read it."Before I could reply, someone touched my shoulders, startling me."George!" I patted his chest once I turned around and saw his cheerful smile. "You scared the living shit out of me!""Good night to you too, Lilith," Fred spoke, coming from behind his twin."They're having dinner with us, I don't know if I told you before," Liv said, taking the keys to open our flat.She didn't tell me, but it wasn't like I would complain.Getting inside the kitchen and preparing dinner all together, chatting about our days and joking around, we finally sat at the table to enjoy our meals with the dim sound of my gramophone from my room. Quite curious, I grabbed the letter Pauline told me that was for me and almost froze when I read the address from where it came."Everything a'right?" Fred asked as soon as he saw my expression, taking the fork to his mouth and making all the eyes focus on me."Yes - Uhm, it's just that...I think the address might be wrong." I replied, feeling unable to open the envelope."Where is it from?" Liv questioned, scowling."The Arambella House," I whispered and felt how everyone hold their gasp. I checked I wasn't reading wrong; Berwick, Northumberland, England. The same number, the same name, the same address...no, I wasn't wrong."Lilith," Olivia whispered, "careful,"I observed the envelope, the only person apart from Severus who knew about the Arambella house's location was my own mother but the letter didn't look as if it had been poisoned nor cursed. Still a bit hesitant, I finally opened the folded parchment, there was a little note in clumsy and quite messy handwriting with a bunch of spelling mistakes;Dere, lilith:

We heard you were hurt by Mistress Circe. We worried for you, Nilsy's been cryin' a lot. I tried to comunicate with Master Severus but didnt reply. Pleas, send us a letter, we miss you.

Love you a lot.

The elves from the Arambella House; Dondey, Nilsy and Weepey.I felt the tears grouping in my eyes as a huge smile covered my face."Lilith?" Pauline asked, worried."It's from the elves," I stuttered, pressing the note against my chest and wiping off the little tear that threatened to leave my eyes. The three elves had been with me even before I was born and after my mother was imprisoned, when I inherited the house and freed them, they still stayed with me, raising me and taking care of me as much as they could. I thought I had left them safe at Spinner's End two summers ago, but apparently, Severus returned them to my house even though it wasn't the safest place for them.Liv looked at me with a comforting smile, she knew how much they meant for me."My three elves have been with me since I was born, they had been family since then," I explained to the rest who didn't have a context. "When Snape left me at the Arambella House alone after Circe was imprisoned when I was 3, they offered to stay there, raising me, even though they were already free. I was under their care for so many years...until last summer," I sniffed, and looked at Liv. "Can you pass me a piece of paper and a pencil, please? They know about the accident and they are worried, Severus hasn't replied to their letters."The blonde nodded and stood up immediately to hand me what I asked her.Carefully, I started writing;My dearest Donds, Nil and Weep;

I'm terribly sorry for not communicating with you sooner, I thought my uncle was taking care of you at Spinner's End and I didn't want to interrupt your well-earned freedom. The attack was really awful and I was heavily hurt by Circe, but I'm okay, my friends have been taking care of me - hope you can meet them soon. You might already know I'm a Harp

and since I know the vault at the house is almost empty, I'll send you a little bit of money before you refuse to receive it.

I miss you three lots lots lots and I love you so much.

- Lilith XX

P.S; Nilsy, don't cry for me, please. I promise you I'm okay.I stood up to tie the letter to Iris's leg and let her fly away and then got back to my seat, still a bit dreamy for having received such a sweet surprise.After going back to our chat and finishing eating, Fred and I laid on my bed, looking at the ceiling while Liv and George cleaned the dishes and Pauline took out her notes to keep revising."I didn't know you were raised by your elves," Fred whispered, breaking the silence between us, only filled by the low notes of a Queen song. "Always thought you were raised by Snape."I sighed."Everybody thinks the same, but no. He visited me twice a month, but the ones who fed me, cleaned me and educated me as much as they could, were the elves. Severus only came to bring me money and to give me some lessons so I was not raised out of the wizarding community.""Why is he like that?" Fred asked, quite annoyed. I snorted, ironic."I've been asking myself the same thing for years and years. When I was little I used to believe it was because of the horrible childhood he had with his father, but thinking about it years later, it didn't make sense. Severus lived with an abusive father but his behaviour and his lack of emotions outside of his own have a deeper meaning than Tobias Snape being a fucking alcoholic who abused my granny. He is like a huge box with thousands and thousands of layers that I'm not able to decipher even though I've been around him for the last 19 years.""You two have a similar story, don't you?" the ginger whispered, quite clueless."I don't know if I would call it similar, darling," I murmured, looking at the ceiling. Thinking of my next words. "We both had shitty dads, that's obvs. Mine abandoned me and his father was a fucking dickhead who wasted all my family's money. My mother, however, doesn't hold a candle up for my lovely granny Eileen."Fred looked at me, curious, silently telling me to keep going. I took a deep breath."Eileen Prince was of a pureblood quite renowned family and when her parents died when she was young, she inherited all the fortune. Her husband was a muggle, and with the economical crisis after the war in Germany, he started drinking and becoming abusive to her, my mother and Severus. He wasted all the money on alcohol, women and drugs until he left her, years later, with two depressed teenagers and a huge debt. Unlike my fucking psychopath mother, Eileen managed to move forward and thanks to her work and her children, she managed to reunite a good amount of money not to worry anymore about it. Part of that money nowadays belongs to me.""You speak about her with a lot of love in your voice...never thought I would hear talk like that about a Snape," he said surprised."She wasn't a Snape. She was a Prince. And I did love her with my entire heart, she's the reason I love blueberries this much and the only human being who showed love to me during my childhood. I didn't know what affection was until I met her and I didn't know affection after she died until I met Liv. I didn't even know what a simple hug was."Fred sighed, listening to me carefully, and grabbed my waist to turn me around, making me lay on his chest." I wish I could have met my grandparents.""You didn't?"He shook his head. "They all died before I was born. Bill and Charlie got to meet the ones from mum's side."We ended up changing the topic because even though my elves' letter was great news, I still didn't feel ready to talk about the Arambella House this much, so we turned the conversation into our day. After a while, we got out of my room and laid on the couch with the rest of our group, ready to watch a film together.✵ ✵ ✵A couple of months kept going by and by late June I was completely recovered and back in business. Remus was healing and his transformations weren't as painful as before, he seemed happier than in any of the last months and that was pretty much my and, especially, Tonks's doing. Their relationship, now official, was going incredibly well and they seemed as if they had bonded in a beautiful and unique way. I noticed the change in him when he arrived at my home in the middle of March with great news ready for me;"I am so happy to announce to you, dear, that now, officially and legally, you are Lilith Medea Lupin," he said, excited and with a huge smile on his face. I couldn't help but jump into his arms and hug him tightly, thanking him a hundred times."You can't imagine how proud I am right now, Remus. I promise you I will carry your last name with the biggest of the honours.""Welcome officially to the Lupin family, then."Draco managed to communicate with me a couple of times more, telling me how even though Harry was trying to get on his way, Myrtle was being a huge help for him to vent freely and I kept wishing I could protect him and help him more.Liv and Pauline were more and more united as time went by, their relationship was healthier than ever and the amount of time they spent together at uni was useful to be understanding whenever the other one was tired or a bit irritated, even though that was something weird to see because both of them were such a pair of angels.The shop was becoming the richest business in the whole Diagon Alley. Thanks to it and the improvement in his relationship with Angie, George couldn't be happier.We, The Harpies, kept doing the best matches in our history and getting amazing scores every time we were out there playing. Being at the top of the classification, we were pretty hyped up for already tasting victory and the league cup. The whole team got along together better than ever and more than teammates, we were friends.My bond with Fred - oh, Merlin. We were together almost every day, being careful not to overwhelm the other. The amounts of laughter, chats and jokes between us made us be closer than ever and the immense improvement in the number of our sex encounters and the passion between us made us feel like in a constant bonfire. We were doing so well, so fused with each other and so pleased in that little world of the two of us, that for a brief couple of days, I started to believe that he might be starting to have romantic feelings for me. Real and long-lasting romantic feelings for me. I didn't want to high up my hopes, but that was an idea that not only melted my heart but also made me feel hope in every single place in my body.Merlin, make that be true, please..."Lilith, now!" Khaleelah shouted, getting me out of my daydream. It was the last match of the season, we were almost grazing the cup and our strategy was working way better than ever.The public roared with joy and cheers, hyping us and whooping, chanting our names and making the field tremble with their voices. Tonks, Liv and Pauline had their faces covered in green and gold paint while the twins next to them were completely shirtless, with their faces - and their chests! - covered in the same colours as well as huge flags and hats of my team. Shouting and clapping more than anyone else. Next to them, way more calmed but still entertained, were Remus and surprisingly, Fleur and Bill, waving little flags with our logo in it.I hit the Bludger with all my strength and hit the other team's chaser's back, stopping him from scoring and gaining a huge whoop from the crowd.With a huge smile on my face, I saw Aileen shouting more than ever, bursting into laughter while doing cartwheels on her broom showing off the Snitch in her hand. We all joined her, cheering up."WE DID IT, GIRLS!" Khaleelah shouted, with a huge smile on her face and the eyes watering because of the emotion."WE FUCKING DID IT!" Gwenog roared, throwing the bat to the air."AND THE HOLYHEAD HARPIES CROWN THEMSELVES AS THE WINNERS OF THIS LEAGUE! CONGRATULATIONS, GIRLS! REALLY REALLY DESERVED!" the match's narrator announced through the megaphones, making the crowd jump in their seats with pure excitement."YES!" I shouted, happily, landing on the ground and fusing with the girls in a huge and tight team hug.Some of our friends jumped to the field and ran to hug us to congratulate us. Khaleelah's fiancé was almost crying with pure pride as he put the girl over his shoulder, showing her off as the queen she was. Verity and Aileen kissed each other passionately, and Gwenog's sisters started to hug her, almost making her fall to the ground. Soon, I felt two familiar gingers hugging me, making a sandwich of the three of us and covering me with the paint on their chests."YOU FUCKING DID IT, MATE!" George shouted, excited, blowing a whistle I don't know where he got from."WE ARE SO BLOODY PROUD OF YOU, THE FUCKING HARPIES ARE THE BEST FUCKING TEAM IN THE WHOLE WORLD!" Fred added, picking me up as he hugged me, making us spin around. I couldn't help but snicker in between his arms."Really well done, dear!" Remus said, once Fred put me back on the floor, kissing my forehead."That was incredible!" Fleur burst, cheerful."Really well done, Lilith. Your team deserved to win," Bill continued."THAT'S OUR GIRL, LIN!" Liv pretended to cry."I'M SO FUCKING PROUD, THEY GROW UP SO FAST!" Pauline faked to wipe off a tear.I hugged the two of them, thanking them for their unconditional support and soon I felt someone throwing me to the ground, smashing me and hugging me tightly as she spread lots of kisses all over my face."I'M - SO - BLOODY - PROUD - OF - YOU!" Tonks spoke, leaving a kiss on my cheek after every word and making me giggle, tickling me."Thank you so much, you lot! I can't thank you enough for all the support," I replied, standing up again and trying to control my emotions.Half an hour later, we were lifting the golden cup of the league between cheers and whoops and with our two captains in the centre, being rewarded for all the effort they had put on the team, especially Khaleelah.We got to celebrate our victory by going out for dinner all together, with our respective companies, and having a lot of fun and drinks. I don't even know how I got back home since the only thing I could remember was watching George, Liv and Aileen doing a weird dance together, Fred and I kissing, Fred and I dancing, both twins being hyped by all the girls as they tried to drink ten shots each one in less than a minute, Pauline talking to a cactus - literally - and Tonks drinking down two beers at the same time.During the night, my feelings about Fred only burnt me more and more in my inside, and as I observed him, being so fucking handsome and so bloody attractive, my drunk and reckless mind got to the conclusion that this was the perfect occasion to confess my feelings for him.I was planning to get home, sneak to his room and finally tell him, in a bold burst of confidence, how I felt about him. How fucking and deeply in love I was with him.Fuck it if he doesn't love me back, at least I would take that secret out of my system.When I finally managed to stand up over my door, trying to find my keys, I noticed a familiar figure by my side."R-Remus!" I whispered, trying not to burp. He looked more serious than before, even paler."Good night, dear," he said in a dim tone. "I know that you are a bit hammered right now, but I think you should know this anyway. I just got the news from a Harry letter."I looked at him, curious, and with the blood pounding hard in my veins as my head cleared up a bit more at his words."What is it?" I managed to stutter, trying to connect my brain and my mouth. "I was about to talk with Fred."He took a deep breath, trying to find the right words."Dumbledore is dead."WHAT?!

"Here, let me put you a sober spell. You can't appear this drunk in front of Mrs Weasley," Remus said, grabbing my wrist carefully."W-where are we - going?" I managed to speak, quite tongue-tied."The Burrow, we will explain to you the entire situation in there," he immediately replied, looking for his wand."Hang on- what about Liv and Lin? And the twins?""Tonks is coming to wake them up, she has to take Liv first to Hogwarts to make sure Luna is okay. The twins are already at the Burrow.""And Draco?!" I asked, nervous when Remus mentioned Luna. The man seemed to hesitate."We will talk about him later, dear. Don't worry, okay?" He finally said, picking his wand and putting it softly against me."I'm sorry for being this hammered, Remus..." I whispered, a bit embarrassed. Lupin smiled at me, more relaxed but still with the nerves on edge."Nothing to apologise for, dear. You didn't know and you deserve to have fun," he applied the spell and then grabbed my hand. "Now, let's go."We appeared at the Burrow, already with the morning sun shining bright behind the house, painting the sky with soft yellow and blue tones, my head clearer than before and chewing gum to hide the alcohol smell. At the door, we found a sobby Molly Weasley who opened her arms widely to welcome us. Remus was the first one to hug her since I still was a bit doubtful."Oh, Remus..." she sobbed in the man's arms, with her brown eyes kinda swollen and red. "What a tragedy...""I know, Molly," Lupin replied as softly as he could, putting a bit of distance between them. "Is Harry already in here?""Yes, the poor boy arrived early in the morning, he will be going later to the funeral and then probably will be sent with his muggle relatives. Those Dursley..." she snorted in disapproval. As soon as her eyes focused on me, her eyes watered again and she hugged me tightly before I could say anything. "Oh, my dear Lilith, I'm terribly sorry, dear... terribly sorry."My heart started to pound against my chest nervously. Why was she giving me her condolences when I barely knew Dumbledore and definitely didn't feel any kind of affection for him? Was it because something happened to Draco?"Remus..." I whispered, scared.The man sighed hard, "Molly, Lilith doesn't know all the details of...Dumbledore's incident."Mrs Weasley sorted her eyes, open wide, from Remus to me and she caressed my hair, giving me a pity look while tutted. "Come inside, dear. You'll like to be sat down once you hear the news."Inside the living room, I found almost all the Weasleys sat down, surrounding Harry, Ron and Hermione. The first boy looked quite disturbed and annoyed. I immediately took a seat next to the Granger girl."Now, is anyone going to tell me what the hell happened?" I burst out after a good couple of seconds of silence."You already know that Dumbledore died," Remus started, after swallowing hard. I nodded. "But you don't know who killed him."I scowled. "Killed?"Remus was about to continue, but Harry interrupted him with a soft but still cold tone."It was your uncle," he said looking straight at me, "I'm sorry, Lilith. He's a Death Eater."I felt my blood freezing in my veins and my sight going blurry. I snorted, thinking it was just a really bad joke, but the seriousness in everyone's eyes told me it was true. Oh, Merlin..."What? No, how?" I stuttered, still in shock. "Severus can be a lot of very bad things, Harry, but a Death Eater? No, that can't be true.""I was there when he killed Dumbledore. I saw how he throw him the killing curse..." Potter continued and I gasped."B-but he trusted Dumbledore! He cared about him! He even put that old man over me!" I managed to speak with my mind working at a dizzy velocity. "If he had been a Death Eater, he would have handed me to my mother or Crouch, but he didn't.""The thing's that... apparently, Snape wasn't the one in charge to kill Dumbledore," Ron intervened, unable to look at my eyes."It was Draco," Hermione continued, with a trembly voice.My heart fell to the ground. That was what they ordered him to do...My poor boy was in charge to kill the greatest wizard of the last century...That was why he couldn't say anything to me."Is he okay? Draco?" I asked, with my voice out of breath.The three of them nodded at the same time. "Bellatrix took him."I don't know if that was what they understand by being safe."Lilith, I know Snape is your uncle and you appreciate him. That's why I think he never let any of the Death Eaters put a hand on you or never tried to communicate with you now that you are out of Hogwarts, because after all, Death Eater or not, he cares about you."I swallowed all the rage and coldness in my body. Severus... a Death Eater. What on Earth made him get closer to the ideas that destroyed his sister's life and mine?"He can't care that much about me if he agrees with the ideas of that mad man and my mother who want me dead."After a couple of minutes later which I spent thinking what could have driven Severus to become a Death Eater or if he had been one all this time and I simply didn't notice, Harry spoke again;"It's all my fault, "he said, coldly, "If I hadn't been so obsessed to discover who the Half-Blood Prince was, I could have noticed something was going wrong."The moment he mentioned that name, an alarm popped off in my head like a huge light."Half-Blood Prince? That's Severus," I murmured, making all the eyes focus on me."I know, he confessed it to me after killing Dumbledore," Harry said, quite annoyed with himself," Hang on, how do you know?"I arched my two eyebrows, quite obvious."That book... it used to be mine. I left it at the Potions classroom. It has been inherited by every Snape since my grandma, Eileen.""What?!""I could have told you if you had shown me the book! It has my notes, my mother's, Severus's and my granny's. It's covered of them actually.""Wait, so you know about the Sectumsemptra curse and the Levicorpus?" Hermione asked, surprised."Of course! They were created by Severus and by Circe.""Oh, Godric," Ron ran his hands through his face."Well, it doesn't matter anymore," Harry said standing up, ready to leave outside with Ginny to catch some fresh air. "There's nothing we can do now.""Is Bill feeling better, mum?" Fred asked, talking for the first time, making me turn around instinctively to look at him."What happened to him?" I questioned, immediately.Mrs Weasley took a deep breath, "He was hurt by this werewolf during the full moon. Lucky him, he wasn't bitten... Fleur is taking care of him and he is feeling better, but Remus said he is probably going to deal with some werewolf-like characteristics for the rest of his life."I didn't have to ask who was the werewolf who hurt him. It was pretty clear. Greyback.My blood boiled only to think about him.While everyone started to get ready for the funeral — which I wasn't going to assist —, Fred sat outside with me. He sighed before speaking;"I know you're chewing into something..."I shook my head, taking my cigarette to my lips as I observed the huge field in front of us and he put one of his hands on my knee."I just feel this is my fault. I'm Severus's niece and I didn't know he was a fucking Death Eater," I tutted, still a bit astonished. "I thought I was safe with him and now, it turns out he was the fucking lion's den. How bloody ironic.""It's not your fault, darling. We all knew what kind of man your uncle was even when we thought he was in our side.""What is the Order going to do now? He knew almost every secret about it, if not every single one. We are fucking ruined," I ran my fingers through my hair, exhausted. "I swear to Merlin I want to knock some fucking sense into him — and Draco, oh Merlin, I can't stop thinking about him either."Fred moved his hand to put it around my shoulders and draw me closer to him."The worst part is that I knew the Death Eaters had him threatened, and Merlin knows I tried to help him to get out of that shit, but the fucker cursed me to be unable to say a word or do anything about it. Bloody hell, he tried to protect me when he was the one being forced to kill the greatest wizard in the last century. He's only 17, Fred!"The ginger huffed, trying to find the words to say."I can't believe I'm saying this about Malfoy himself - but you will see he will find a way to stay away from that shit. I don't know very much about his shitty family apart from the obvious, but heard that his mother genuinely wants to keep him safe.""Fucking unbelievable I'll have to trust Narcissa Malfoy in this," I let out, with my eyes quite lost because the images of Draco and my uncle filled my mind.✵ ✵ ✵While the rest of the house decided to attend the Headmaster's funeral, I stayed at the Burrow, getting this ready for their arrival later in the evening and Charlie Weasley's one as well. Since Fleur and Bill's wedding was still up for this summer, we had to get things ready as soon as possible and all the Weasley family was going to be present on that important day. In the middle of all the sorrow and sadness that the betrayal of my uncle provoked me, the idea of such a happy event like a wedding excited me and made me feel a little taste of happiness. I was quite nervous because after getting Fleur's invitation, I noticed I had never been to a wedding before and I only had a month to find what I would wear and who I would take as my partner.Would Fred want to come with me? Was it a too bold movement to ask him?After I cleaned a little bit the mess formed in the living room and I prepared tea for later, I decided to take a little rest from my thoughts. Going straight to the room that used to belong to the twins and throwing myself in Fred's bed, letting myself breathe his scent and feel as if he was there cuddling with me, I barely had my eyes closed for what it felt like a minute when I heard the door from downstairs opening.Silently, I grabbed my wand and went downstairs, making sure not to make any noise."What are you doing here?" I said, deadpan, putting my wand down."It's my house," Fred snorted, ironic with a smile, taking off his jacket.I rolled my eyes at his sarcasm."Aren't you supposed to be at Dumbledore's funeral?""Yes, but I wanted to get back home soon. Charlie will be arriving any time soon and I want to welcome my favourite older brother."I grinned, crossing my arms. "Favourite?"He shrugged, "He's quite cool. Lives how he wants and his only worry is his dragons," Fred laid down on the couch, letting his shirt pull up a bit, showing his perfect abdomen. "Don't tell him I said it, though.""Wasn't planning to do so anyway.""Come, lay here with me, beautiful," Fred spoke in a murmured, opening his arms to receive me. I smiled at him, and carefully laid on his chest as I let him play with my hair.We stayed like that for a while, in comfortable silence, just hearing each other's breathing, until someone knocked at the door.I moved to let Fred stand up, and stretching himself, he walked lazily to the door."Coming!"He opened the door and I heard a masculine voice talking to him, he made this universal bloke-greeting that every boy seemed to know and finally let the other man enter the room so I could see him.I didn't recognise him, but observing him carefully I could see the familiarity he held with Fred. He was ginger with undefined curls and messy hair, brown sparkly eyes, well-built, and a face so full of freckles that made him look tanned. His arms were muscled and even though he was shorter than Fred, if it wasn't because of the kind and relaxed expression on his face, he could have been so intimidating, especially because of all the tiny scars that decorated his skin. He had a cool 80s style that I found quite attractive - not as cool as Bill's, though - and the first thought that came to my mind was that he was, by far, the most handsome Weasley right after Fred and George.

Of course, the man couldn't be anybody else but Charlie Weasley himself.

Charlie Weasley focused on me for a fleeting moment and then went back to look at his brother, with a confused smile."We have a visit?"Fred's eyes moved from me to look at his brother, taking me off of my reverie."Yes, she's Lilith Lupin. A family friend."Lilith Lupin. The first time I have been introduced as a Lupin. But the excitement and pounding in my heart didn't last long, actually, it ceased as Fred said the second lie — A family friend. Not his friend with benefits, not someone special. A fucking family friend. Didn't know you shag your family friends, Frederick.I shook Charlie's hand, trying to smile at him even though his brother's words annoyed me."Nice to meet you,""Your name sounds familiar to me. Have we met before?" he asked, curiously."No, we haven't. But I'm a Harpie and we won this season's cup, maybe that rings a bell to you.""FRED!" Mrs Weasley's voice scared the shit out of us from outside the door, "COME 'ERE A MINUTE! HELP YOUR DAD WITH THE PROTECTIVE SPELLS!"The mentioned boy rolled his eyes and giving me a last quick and almost imperceptible gaze, he opened the door ready to leave again;"GOIN', MUM!"I noticed how Charlie let himself fall on the couch and looked at me curiously, making me turn around to face him."So, Lilith, right?" he started, giving me a kind smile, "care to explain why my brother lied to me?"I stayed there, puzzled at his words. How did he know Fred lied?He seemed to guess my thoughts because his smile widened."I know Fred almost as well as George does. He can't fool me.""I am a family friend, he did not lie in that," I clarified after taking a deep breath, "But — let's say I have a way closer friendship with him.""Hang on, " he clicked, arching his eyebrows, amazed "so you are this girl Bill said that had my little brother drooling!""Bill said that?!"I asked, quite surprised at the man's choice of words."Sort of. He said there was a girl that had our brother's mind a bit occupied, more like. I added the drooling part right after I saw how he looks at you.""Lupin is not my real last name either," I confessed."I know. Remus Lupin doesn't have children, and I connected the dots when you told me you are a Harpie. Let me guess, Arambella, right?"I nodded. "But legally and officially it is Lupin.""I like it better.""So do I.""In which house were you again?" he asked, quite curious."I never said it.""Now it's a good chance to say it."I huffed, grinning. "Slytherin.""Oh, mate, so you are the same girl Fred kept talking about a few years ago! Should have known! He talked and talked about how much he hated you. And look at you two now...Bloody hell, what hormones do..."I couldn't help but giggle."Are you two having fun?" Fred's voice interrupted, making me turn around to look at him. He was leaning against the door's frame, arms crossed, jaw clenched and a little smile that didn't reach those eyes brightening with mischief and fire.I arched one of my eyebrows at him, challenging, and imitating his smile."Yeah, your brother's quite cool.""Thank you, Lupin," Charlie high-fived me, staring at his brother.Fred simply snorted, ironic, and moved from the door where soon the rest of his family appeared, accompanied as usual by Hermione, but not by Harry since the poor boy had to leave back with his muggle unbearable aunt."Charlie, my dear boy!" Mrs Weasley greeted her son, hugging him tightly, making him a bit uncomfortable. Apparently, he wasn't very fond of physical contact. "Now that you're here, we can distribute properly the rooms. Ginny, dear, you'll be sleeping with Ron. Fleur and Bill together, obviously. Fred, George, you don't mind sharing your room with Charlie, do you? And Hermione and Lilith, you two will be staying in Ginny's dorm, alright?""Mum," Charlie intervened, using a soft tone with his next words, "We don't know if Percy is coming. I can occupy his room until we have any news from him."Mrs Weasley's smile faded slowly at the thought of his missing child. Percy Weasley was still a bit far from being as related to his family as he used to be. "A'right, dear. As you want.""Mrs Weasley," I called her attention, "You don't have to worry this much, I can go back to my place till the wedding arrives."She immediately shook her head, moving her hands pretty effusively. "No, no, no, dear. If I'm not wrong your friend Olivia Lovegood it's at her father's home with her girlfriend, isn't she? You can't stay in that flat completely alone and I know Remus will like to know that you are under our protection."I was about to open my mouth again, but she interrupted me;"Oh, and don't worry, I invited Xenophillus Lovegood to have tea with Arthur, Remus and me tomorrow so you can see your friends too."I smiled at her. "Thank you so much, Mrs Weasley. I really appreciate it."✵ ✵ ✵A couple of weeks later, I was already accommodated at the Burrow, making sure Fleur wasn't feeling lonely anymore — even though now both Ginny and Molly treated her way better — and having Liv and Pauline visiting me once a week, who reacted as shocked as me when I told them the news about Snape. Hanging out together in the immense field with both girls, I received a curious visit.After the farewells with Pauline and Olivia, Tonks appeared at the house's door, looking excited and impatient but trying to play it cool."Evening, Dora," I greeted her as she entered the place with her hands in the pockets of her trousers."Hello," she took a deep breath, "Where are the rest?""Oh, I dunno about Charlie, the twins and Ginny, but Ron and Hermione are outside talking in the field and Bill, Fleur, Mrs and Mr Weasley had some things to buy for the wedding."The word 'wedding' seemed to alert her and I noticed how she looked away, biting her lower lip and swallowing nervously."Is everything okay?" I asked and she immediately nodded."Arthur repaired incredibly well the Burrow, didn't he?"I scowled a bit confused. After the incident with the Death Eaters, Mr Weasley occupied his whole time in rebuilding his home and luckily, it was almost as if the fire had never happened."Yeah.""How have you been? Is it difficult for you to be here after the incident with the bitch of your mother?""Not as much as I thought. I just avoid the part of the field where she tried to kill me," I replied, looking at how she played with the rings in her hands. "Dora, what's going on?"She took a deep breath, and looked at me, unable to contain her smile."Remus and I want you to come with us to a special place."I frowned my eyebrows even more."What? Where and why?""To the muggle court," she drawled nervously."Why?" I repeated and she spoke so fast that I had to ask her to repeat it, "Come again?""Wearegettingmarriedandwewantyoutobeourwitness!" she said all out once.I felt how my mouth opened wide."WHAT?!" I giggled in pure shock.✵ ✵ ✵Remus and Tonks's wedding was simple, beautiful and incredibly private. Andromeda Tonks, Ted Tonks — who was Dora's witness — a friend of Remus and myself were the only guests. That was how they wanted. Remus was almost crying with happiness when he saw Dora entering the court in her punky bride dress with a chain around her waist, blonde hair and beautiful boots that I wish I could have owned."She looks so fucking good!" I whispered, watching her enter the place. She had changed in less than five minutes from her work clothes to that awesome dress and had dragged me with her, before letting me even change into a more proper outfit for such an event, to introduce me to her parents and make me be Remus's witness."She's absolutely gorgeous," Remus looked at her with such an absolute devotion that melted my heart as he wiped off one of his tears. Since he didn't have a lot of money, he was wearing one of his common and worn-out suits, but still looking incredibly good. When I knew he couldn't afford a new one, I offered my money to buy him one but he quickly refused without letting me insist.Andromeda Tonks turned out to be an amazing woman with an aristocratic and mysterious look around her that reminded me of her Black ancestry. She was incredibly similar in her physical appearance to the bitch of her sister Bellatrix, but Andromeda had aged way better. She gave me a kind smile and accomplice look as soon as Dora introduced me as the rebellious Slytherin of this decade.Ted Tonks was a tall and thin man, dark brown hair and deep blue eyes that reminded me of her daughter's. He had a huge kind smile and a thick Scottish accent that made him seem really attractive. Especially, what called the most my attention, was definitely the way he looked at his wife; with pure love and affection.If only I had certain ginger looking at me like that...The last of the guests, a lovely lady that seemed to be around Remus's age, introduced herself to me as an old friend who really appreciated Remus. She was incredibly beautiful, the kind of person that you know she must have stolen lots of hearts in her youth years. I introduced myself as Remus's adoptive daughter and she gave me a wide smile as soon as she saw the huge bond between Lupin and me.The muggle man that officiated the wedding looked at Tonks's dress with absolute surprise and certain despise but the way Andromeda and I were glaring at him, made him officiate the wedding normally.I signed on the paper as Lilith Lupin with tears in my eyes and a huge smile at seeing two of the people I loved the most in the world getting finally happy and together. Both of them deserved the biggest happiness possible."Welcome to the Tonks family, Remus," Ted shook Remus's hand, giving him a kind smile after the muggle man finally declared them husband and wife by the muggle law. I had heard how Ted was the one who convinced Andromeda to accept Lupin in their family, since he was the first one to notice how in love his daughter was and how Remus's restrained feelings for her and the fear to hurt her was, actually, hurting him more like."Take care of my daughter, Lupin," Andromeda smiled at him, lifting a bit her chin and giving him that aristocratic stare."Welcome to the Lupin family, Dora!" I jumped into her arms, making her giggle. "Should I start calling you 'mommy'?""I would say you can call me mommy somewhere else, but now that I am a married woman..." she let out a murmur, making Ted, Remus and I snort, amused."Nymphadora!" Andromeda called her out, trying uselessly to restrain her smile."Thank you for being here tonight, dear," Remus thanked me, holding my hands in his and kissing them as the tears threatened to leave his eyes again, "In the middle of this fucking war, having my adopted daughter in my wedding with my Dora, makes me the happiest man on Earth."I hugged him tightly, feeling his paternal affection around me."I'm so happy that she's making you happy," I said in a little whisper. "You deserve it, Remus. More than anyone else in this world."Tonks came back to be beside her — now, officially — husband and both of them left on a kiss on each other's lips, with bright eyes full of love that drove them into that tiny little world where only the two of them existed."OH MERLIN! I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS MY FIRST WEDDING EVER!" I burst excited, jumping into their arms, making them catch me and hug me between giggling.While we kept talking for a little longer with Dora's parents, Remus got the chance to have a private and comfortable talk with his friend.The three of us went back to the Burrow still laughing and a bit incredulous of what just happened. When we opened the door, we found everyone sat at the table, having dinner. As soon as we appeared, all eyes were on us."Lilith, dear, where have you—" Mrs Weasley started asking with a smile that faded away and transformed into a wide-open mouth as soon as she saw Tonks's outfit. "Dora, what in Godric's sake are you wearing?"Dora snickered looking at Remus, accomplice."A weddin' dress.""May I ask why?" Mrs Weasley kept as shocked as before."Mum, I think it's pretty obvious," Charlie intervened with a huge smile "My dear friend Tonks got secretly married to Remus Lupin and Lilith was their witness, am I wrong?""You aren't, mate!" Dora burst excited, showing him her new ring."Oh, my God! MARRIED?!""I know I didn't say a word about it but both Remus and I wanted it to be a surprise," Tonks said, apologising at the rest with a big smile."We only invited our witnesses, Dora's mum and a good friend of mine from Hogwarts."I looked at him, astonished."You met her at Hogwarts? Do you mean that she is —" I couldn't finish my question because Remus nodded, interrupting me;"Mary McDonald, yes. Aileen's mum.""Oh, Remus! Why didn't you tell me before?! That's incredibly cool!"I knew how important Mary and their whole friend group — which had included Harry's parents, Sirius, Marlene McKinnon and the traitor of Peter Pettigrew — were to Remus, and I was incredibly happy that they got to reunite in such an important moment in Remus's life."Well, luckily for me, I prepared your favourite meal, Tonks! We can celebrate your wedding too!" Mrs Weasley made us take a seat. I ended up next to Charlie and in front of Fred, who stared at me piercingly and intense."Lilith, Dora didn't even give you the chance to change your clothes?" Charlie asked me with a smile."No," I giggled, "It's quite ironic the fact that I attended my first wedding ever with casual clothes.""To be fair, I'm gonna be Bill's best man and if mum lets me, I would attend the wedding in jeans and boots. But I think we both know that's not goin' to happen.""Yes, she would freak out if every detail is not perfect," I added, staring briefly at the woman with a bit of affection she was earning from me."Ugh, yeah, she's still trying to convince me to cut my hair,""Lilith, dear, Charlie isn't bothering you, is he?" Molly Weasley asked me from across the table, smiling at me but giving her son a severe stare."Oh, no, not at all," I quickly said, "Charlie's really nice."She nodded, continuing the conversation with the rest of the members at the table and hiding with her voice the ironic snort that came out of Fred's mouth. I could feel his eyes on me and when I dared to look at him, still with my challenging and bitchy smile, I found his look burning me and the corners of his lips twisting into a dim smirk.When we finished eating, while the rest of the family was taking their dirty dishes to the kitchen, I felt a tall body behind me, glueing to me a bit too much.Fred's lips grazed my ear, making me hold my breath and stare all over the room to make sure no one was noticing it."I want you in my room at midnight," he whispered with a mischievous tone, smacking my bum without making any loud sound and already separating from me."What about George?"Fred smiled while walking backwards. "He's sneaking to visit Angie," his voice got a lower and deep tone, "It will only be the two of us, darling."A warm shiver ran through my spine making me bite my lip. Recently, since I started getting along quite well with Charlie Weasley, Fred seemed to have his eyes on me more than usual, and more than ever, he seemed to regret having called me a 'family friend', even though he knew damn well that nor his brother or I had any kind of interest on the other rather than a friendship.If there was something I knew, it was that Fred Weasley was the only one I wanted.I stared at him with a feline smile, and murmured in a low voice, making him be the only one to hear me, and almost purring;"As you want, Freddie."

Lately, while we were trying to tire up ourselves enough to finally go to sleep, chilling and chatting in the living room in a low voice since Mrs and Mr Weasley were already sleeping and Tonks and Remus had already gone back to their place, I could barely take my eyes away from Fred. I was still a bit pissed off at him but it was slowly fading away as his voice was becoming deeper because of his murmurs, his hair messed and his eyes a bit narrowed because of the tiredness and his legs spread, giving him a sleepy and lazy demeanour."A'right, lads, I'm leaving," George announced, standing up, taking me out of my reverie, "Have a girlfriend to cuddle.""Use protection, 'm not ready to be an auntie!" Ginny scoffed, stretching in her seat.George clicked his tongue, snickering as he pulled on his jacket, and made sure not to make too much noise as he opened the door ready to leave."See you lot in the morning!""Gotta go to sleep, kids," Charlie spoke, running his hands through his face and stretching as well, making his shirt go slightly up, "I'm fuckin' knackered,"I felt Fred's eyes piercing me from across the room and even though I tried not to look at him, my eyes immediately went to meet him. He had a very dim smile on his face as his arched brows made his brown burning stare even more intimidating and demanding than usual. He clenched his jaw and moved his head to discreetly point upstairs.Without any other word needed, Fred stood up and started to go calmly straight to his room. I waited a little bit before start leaving in his direction, being discreetly covered by my loyal accomplice, Hermione. I didn't even knock on the door, simply opened it and sneaked inside, closing the door behind me as soon as I got in the dorm. Before turning around, I cast a Muffliato.The room was just exactly like the last time I saw it and I was genuinely surprised that the twins hadn't turned it upside down yet. While I entered completely the room, already more relaxed, I noticed the dim light from the lamp on Fred's nightstand being the only illumination in the place. No stars were brightening that night on the night sky, probably, because of the strong clouds that were covering the whole of England from north to south."Finally!" Fred's voice murmured behind me, making me immediately turn around to face him. He was cockily leaning against the bathroom's door frame, looking at me with that arrogant and devilish smile that made me so weak in front of him. "Come here, darling,"Without even hesitating once, I followed him inside the bathroom and observed how he closed and locked the door, leaving us completely alone and trapped with each other. He positioned in front of me, looking at me with a curious look and putting his hands in the pockets of his trousers."Now, what I do with you?""You're the one who told me to come," I shrugged, pretending to sound uninterested.He snickered, looking at his feet and then back to me, slowly, looking too fucking fine to be real. Unhurriedly, Fred approached me, making me walk backwards only to tease him until my back met the cold wall of tiles. His hips glued to mine and his hand slowly went up from my neck to cup my cheek in a gesture that almost seemed sweet, letting it travel through my mouth where his thumb traced the outline of my lower lip."You know what, darling? I thought that after having fucked you so many times we have lost count by now, you'd know how to behave, but judging by how you flirted in front of me with my own brother... I'm not that sure anymore."I scowled, confused, without erasing the smile on my face."What do you mean?""Charlie's really nice" he imitated my voice, putting a stupid high-pitched tone that genuinely bothered me."She's a family friend," I scoffed, making my voice sound deeper as if I was imitating his, making him almost flinch and let out a chuckle. "If there's someone here who should be pissed off that's me, Freddie. I didn't know you fuck your family friends."He clicked his tongue, amused, and glued, even more, his body to mine."C'mon, angel, you know you are way more than just a simple family friend."Fred's eyes went down from my eyes to my lips as his smile grew and his hand surrounded my neck. I grabbed the collar of his shirt and pulled him even closer to me, hearing his deep breath and grazing my nose with his."Am I, Freddie?" I teased him, guiding my other hand slowly all over his still covered chest till the strip of his trousers. He sighed, putting more pressure on my neck."Don't provoke me, Lilith.""As if you hadn't brought me here on purpose. We both know what you want from me right now, darling."He bit his lower lip and slowly started to leave soft and warm kisses at the corners of my lips, making me close my eyes and tempting me as only he knew. When I thought he was about to finally kiss me, he moved away and walked with all the patience in the world to the shower, a couple of steps next to us, and turned the water tap on. As the steam from the hot water started to fill the room, Fred - with his eyes pretty much still on mine, challenging me - started to strip off. His shirt flew to the other side of the room, letting me appreciate his slightly marked abs and the moles and freckles forming beautiful constellations in his golden skin. Before letting me even blink, still frozen in my place, he smirked and pulled down his trousers and boxers, showing off.I felt my mouth going dry. It didn't matter how many times I had seen him naked, it still gave me the same goosebumps it did the first time. I'd never get tired of saying how he looked as a bloody Greek god just arrived from Olympus itself.He got inside the shower, letting the hot water soak his ginger hair, making it even brighter and fire-like. Already covered in the waterdrops and looking at me like such a temptation, he smiled and started to softly and slowly stroke his dick, letting me watch how it got harder and harder in his hand and making me almost drool at the view."Are you going to get in or do I have to undress you myself?" Fred teased me with that raspy voice that sent quivers straight to my clit. I couldn't help but lick my lips, having the urge to rub my thighs together to calm the growing fire in between them.I smirked at him and painfully slowly started to take off my shirt and my bra. Fred's eyes shined with desire at the only sight of my piercings and my naked skin, and a soft muffled moan left his lips, starting to move his hand faster.Faster than before, I pulled my trousers down and my knickers, being completely naked before him and slowly approaching him, without breaking eye contact.When I was just a step from the shower, his arm surrounded my waist and made me enter inside with him, slamming his lips with mine as soon as he put us two under the hot stream, glueing our bodies and feeling against my skin how he kept stroking himself. As his lips kept claiming me and burning me as usual, I slide my hand all over his god-like chest to his hips and then caressed his throbbing dick, putting his own hand away.Fred groaned, deep and raspy, against my lips as soon as I started caressed him. He tried to sneak his hand between my legs but I slapped it before giving him the chance to do so."Be a good boy, Freddie, let me please you."He nodded effusively, taking a deep and long breath as I went on my knees. Looking at him and how the water fell like a cascade all over his body, I ran my tongue from his base through his tip and tried to fit as much of him inside my mouth as he grabbed my hair in a ponytail and rocked his hips, desperate. He tilted his head back as soon as his tip hit the back of my throat and a loud whimper escaped from his mouth."Fuck, Lilith!"I smiled as I passed my tongue all over the tiny water drops in his hips that were tempting me so bloody much. I wanted to take as much of him as I could.Keeping eye contact with him as I licked his dick, Fred got so desperate that gripped my neck, making me stand up and kissed me furiously, pinning me against the shower wall, feeling his still hard and pulsating dick grinding against my wetness. A little moan escaped from my mouth as his touch felt burning and possessive."Freddie..." I couldn't help but whisper."If you keep sucking me so well I'm gonna end up coming too soon, darling," he whispered, "and even though I love your mouth, I rather cum inside your pussy."Before I could say anything, this time he was the one going on his knees and running his hands slowly all over my abdomen, he caressed my legs and put one of them over his shoulder."But, first things first," he purred, looking me straight in the eye. Without waiting any longer, Fred sank his face in me and quickly, I felt his tongue sucking my clit to then give slow and passes in my entrance, drinking off me as much as he could. A hoarse moan left my lips as I slightly rocked my hips against his face. "Oh, look, Lilith. You're soaked. How fucking pretty is that..."His lips kissed me down there with a passion and craving that left my legs trembling, sucking my already swollen clit and giving me the most delicious goosebumps to ever experience as his tongue against me felt like a smooth and pleasing touch. A hungry soft growl left his mouth as he went deeper into me, eating me out as a starving animal and sinking his tongue in my entrance, rubbing his nose in my clit."Fred!" I moaned when I felt his tongue moving in circles, making me almost reach the stars."Tell me, Lilith," Fred whispered to then give a lazy lick, caressing my thigh as his other hand squeezed my waist, "who's the one making this pussy drip?""Y-you," I managed to stutter at the feeling of his tongue moving faster and his burning lips taking as much of me as he could."You- what, darling?" he teased me. Kissing my inner thighs, sucking and biting the sensitive skin."You, daddy," I whimpered, pulling his hair to drive him back where I was craving him."Mmmh, that's my good girl," he smiled, to then rub his tongue against me, taking me too damn close to my own climax. I felt already the familiar knot forming on my stomach and the goosebumps covering my skin from up to down as his tongue moved faster and his lips kept drinking off me, overstimulating me to the point that I thought I would melt right there in between his arms. "Cum over my face, darling."I tilted my head, full of ectasis, as my throat felt rasped with my own moans and whines."Fuck, Freddie, you wanna kill me..." I whimpered, pulling his hair harder and feeling my legs trembling as an exquisite fire covered me from up to down.Fred snickered and left a single kiss on my pussy before continuing to drive me crazy;"Ah-ah, love," he tutted, "I wanna make you feel more alive than ever before,"My body finally reached the climax, guiding me into an explosive orgasm that peaked into a louder whimper, feeling my juices going down my legs and into Fred's lips as he kept savouring me. My mind went dizzy and every nerve in my body felt an electric current that ruined me and messed me in the most beautiful way possible."And to let you know how I'm the only one who can make this pussy cum as many times as I fucking want," he scoffed running his fingers through my overstimulated wetness. He stood up again and put his fingers on my lips, inviting me to suck them. I ran my tongue slowly around them, pretty much out of breath and keeping eye contact with Fred - whose eyes were piercing me, brightening in desire and desperation - tasting my own flavour in his fingers.His hand went back to my neck and he kissed me again; taking his time, slowly, demanding, claiming, intense and making me savour our flavours from each other's mouth. While his lips went down, from my jaw to my sensitive neck, his hands travelled to cup my bum and before I could even notice, I was surrounding his hips with my legs, pulling him closer to me and feeling his hard dick throbbing and grinding against me. I pulled Fred's hair as his teeth softly trapped my nipples, letting his tongue play with my piercings and leaving beautiful lovebites all over my skin.The hot water kept falling over us, as a bewitching melody, driving us even together and making us feel immersed into a sensual and private atmosphere where only the two of us existed.With his hands around my thighs, holding me, Fred rested his forehead against mine, closing his eyes harshly."I need to fuck you now, Lilith," he murmured with that desperate and frustrated deep voice, "I think I might explode if I don't do it.""Then fuck me, Freddie," I whispered rubbing my nose with his, looking at him straight in the eye. He took a deep breath and still staring deeply into me, he positioned in my entrance, digging his fingers on my thighs as I held to his back, and pushed into me tortuously slow."F-fuck..." I whimpered at the feeling of him stretching me and filling me. Fred drowned his raspy and deep moan against my neck, breathing heavily. He pushed again, this time harder, making sure he was getting as deeper as possible."I'll never get tired of this," he whispered, shaking his head and thrusting again  — still slowly to let me adjust — and sending butterflies straight to my stomach.The cold of the wet wall on my back in contrast with Fred's burning corporal warmth felt so delicious that I couldn't help but dig my nails on his back as he started thrusting again, faster and rougher, groaning fucking beautifully."Oh, daddy..."I let out in a muffled moan, scratching him and clenching around him, making him whimper and get goosebumps as he pounded even harder with his hands squeezing harshly my bum. "Feels so fucking good."Fred started to leave messy and warm kisses all over my neck. "Oh, my angel. If you could only imagine how good it feels to fuck you."His dick rubbed harshly my weakest spot and I whined, making Fred smile and kiss me softly, biting my lower lip."I bet no one else knows how ruined you get whenever I touch this point," he scoffed, rocking his hips faster and hitting it rougher, making me let out a messy cry.I opened my mouth and stuck out my tongue. Fred knew my intentions and spat right there to then slam his lips back to mine. I clenched again around him, feeling even more his thrusts and hearing him gasp in his own moan.The steam around us and the water drops all over our bodies let us feel even closer to each other and made the connection between our bodies even more intimate. Fred slowed down his pounds, teasing me and I couldn't help but whine, holding on to my nails dug in his back as I started moving my hips over him."Fuuuuck!" we let out at the same time in whispered moans at the delicious sensation. Fred slammed me closer to his body as I kept moving, hiding my face in his neck and whimpering because of how fucking good it felt."That's it, darling, use me to make you cum like the perfect whore you are for me," Fred murmured squeezing my bum as I rocked my hips, making us moan loud at the same time. He grabbed me harshly again and started thrusting hard again, taking back the control and driving me too fucking close to my climax again."Freddie!" I cried out, running my nails all over his back and feeling myself throbbing and pulsating around him as the pressure felt unbearable."Cum around me, Lilith. Let daddy know how good I can make you feel,"That was enough to make me burst in between his arms for the second time. Feeling the current all over my body and making me tremble, unable to pronounce any sound further than a muffled gasp as I clenched once again around him and I became a weak ruined mess for him. My body exploded into one of the best orgasms of my life, and as usual, Fred was the cause.His hands dug deeper in my skin as he pounded faster and messily, trying to reach his own climax. I grabbed his neck, pulling his face closer to mine, and as he kept thrusting into me fast and rough, I trapped his lower lip between my teeth, slowly and softly, putting enough pressure on his neck to make him whine with pure pleasure."Fuck, Lilith!" he whimpered, full of ectasis."Cum for me, Freddie," I whispered against his lips and he trembled, closing his eyes harshly and tilting his head back as he started to slightly tremble, his dick heavily pulsating and throbbing and coming hard inside of me.Fred pulled out of me and leaned his back on the wet wall in front of me, both of us trying to catch air."That was bloody good," he drawled, with a dreamy smile on his face, pretty out of breath."Fuck yes it was," I snickered, trying to get my breath back."Still think you're only a family friend?" he grinned at me, challenging.I chuckled, shaking my head. "Still think I was flirting with your brother?"Fred smiled and ran his fingers through his ginger hair, closing his eyes and tilting his head back to let the strong stream fall all over his spectacular body, sending me goosebumps as I thought how someone could be so damn attractive and tempting.Fuck, what a view.He opened his eyes again and with a mischievous smile on his face, he pulled me closer to him, hugging me and rubbing his nose with mine in a sweet gesture. We cleaned ourselves and finally got out of the shower between giggles and jokes.As I saw Fred putting on his pyjama trousers and getting his bed ready, I pulled back my pyjama."Alright, I'm knackered," I sighed, exhausted, and ready to leave back to my shared dorm with Hermione. "See you, tomorrow, Freddie."I couldn't even give two steps when I felt Fred's hand trapping my wrist and dragging me back to him."Oh, no, beautiful. You're sleeping with me tonight," he said, making me space in his bed."Well, if you want, I can sleep on Georgie's bed if he's staying the night at Angie's place.""What part of sleeping with me you didn't click on, darling?" he scoffed, making me get into his bed with a little smile and the butterflies going crazy inside my belly. "I want your pretty face and your cuddles here, with me."Oh, Freddie, if you knew how much you disassemble me..."A'right, a'right, you win," I snickered in a soft voice, feeling one of his arms wrapping around my waist and pulling me closer, to glue my back to his naked chest."Good night, beautiful," Fred whispered, leaving a soft and quick kiss on my cheek and moving his wand to turn off the light."Good night, Freddie," I replied in the same tone, caressing his hand against my belly, hugging me.Dear fucking Merlin, what a great night.

A couple of weeks later, during the final days of July, Hermione asked me to accompany her to a very special place. But, unlike Tonks's beautiful surprise, Hermione's one was way more bitter. Because of the recent attacks directed to muggle families and the clear target over her parents, Hermione decided to make a bold move to protect them. The first time she mentioned it to me, it looked like an excessive idea but chewing into it on my mind, I finally agreed with her.She was going to erase her parents' memories of her.Since it was such a difficult moment for Hermione, I immediately agreed to go with her and show her my support. While she was inside of the Grangers' house, I waited outside in the street, observing how the grey fog invaded the summer sky, making it almost look like a winter day. England didn't use to be a sunny country, but this grey weather was too extreme even for us and even though I didn't want to think about it, I knew the Death Eaters were the reason behind it.Finishing my cigarette and watching carefully all over the street to make sure no one suspicious was looking at us, I finally saw Hermione coming out of her home with watery eyes and trembling hands.I immediately went to hug her and console her. Even though my relationship with my parents was fucking chaotic and traumatic, I could understand the love Hermione felt for hers and I was pretty sure that erasing their memory was a hard decision."You are incredibly brave, you do know that, right?"I whispered, caressing her back and hearing her breathing deeply. "They are going to be okay, you made the bravest and best decision for them.""Thanks, Lilith," she stuttered in a soft voice, hugging me so tightly I thought I would fuse with her."You know what they're gonna do now?" I asked once she started to walk again, getting away from her home."I sent them to Australia. It was the first place that came to my mind where they can be safe and far from everything happening in here."I nodded. After a couple of seconds in silence in which we only kept walking, I finally spoke again;"Where are we going now?""Remember that plan I told you about that has to do with Harry?"I nodded again."Well, it's gonna happen today. I'm going to the Dursleys' place.""I'm going with you," I stated, pretty firmly.Hermione turned around briefly to look at me, scowling; "You sure? It can be dangerous, Lilith, and maybe we have to confront the Death Eaters.""Well, all the more reason then. Besides, if Dora is going as well, now that she's pregnant, she will need some extra protection too."A few days ago, Tonks came to the Burrow paler than ever before but a huge smile on her face, hands trembling and erratic breathing. She confessed to me about her pregnancy in a low and dim stutter that later turned into tears of pure joy. If there was someone who had love enough for a baby, that was Tonks. I was with her when she announced it to Remus, who couldn't help but let out one or two tears of emotion.But, even though I knew he was going to be the best father in the entire world and that he would love that baby with his entire heart, I also knew that he was worried about having passed his lycanthropy to the kid and he blamed himself for putting Dora and their own baby in that situation. He even confessed to me that one of the many reasons why he had insisted so much on adopting me as his daughter was because he never thought he would have children of his own.I spoke to him, trying to show him that the baby would be born completely healthy, that the lycanthropy gene isn't always inherited and that the baby Lupin-Tonks was going to be incredibly loved and healthy lad.Hermione agreed and soon, with the starry sky already covering London, we finally arrived at Privet's Drive.As soon as we stood in front of Harry's home in that slightly-posh muggle neighbourhood, a couple of familiar gingers came straight to me, one of them, in particular, was glaring at me with a mixture of annoyance and surprise."Merlin's balls, what the fuck are you doing here?" Fred asked me in a low murmur."Shh, Weasley! You're gonna wake up the whole fucking neighbourhood!" Mad-Eye called him out in the distance but Fred ignored him."What do you think I'm doing?" I replied, ironic. "Harry needs as much protection as possible.""Oh, no," he tutted, "You barely healed completely a few weeks ago and you want to risk yourself again?""Don't be so dramatic," I rolled my eyes, "Besides, you're risking yourself too, am I wrong?""Yeah, but I'm not a bloody objective for the Death Eaters, Lilith.""Lilith, dear, are you sure this is the wisest decision?" Remus asked me, arching his eyebrows.I snorted, "Maybe it's not the wisest, but it is what I have to do. I'm not gonna stay at the Burrow sitting on my hands while all of you are out there fighting. Especially you, Tonks, being pregnant makes you a target for them and you'll need protection."Fred finally sighed, giving up and softening his eyes on me as his twin approached us."You better take care of yourself and not be the daredevil you usually are," he warned me in a whisper, with a little smile threatening to cover his lips."Bah, pal, let her be! My mate Lilith knows how to take care of herself," George smiled, putting his arm over my shoulders, making me smile too.Without waiting any longer, the front door opened, showing us a surprised Harry. Ron was the first one to enter, being followed by Hermione, who quickly hugged Harry, and by Professor Hagrid, who I knew he had a close bond with the Potter boy. Mad-Eye interrupted their cosy moment by hurrying up and entering the house too."Hello, Harry," I winked at him, entering the place just behind Kingsley.The boy smiled at me immediately, going straight to hug me, "Lilith! Good to see you again!"Bill Weasley introduced himself to Harry and quickly, the twins rambled behind him."He wasn't always this handsome," Fred said, amused, coming next to me."Dead ugly," George added, standing by his twin side."Just remember, Fleur, Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now," Remus joked when Bill addressed the scar the bastard of Greyback gave him. I rolled my eyes with a little grin and Remus winked at me with a paternal smile that later directed to Harry."My husband, the joker," Tonks, smiled."We'll have time for a cosy catch-up later!" Moody interrupted, calling our attention and making us go serious. I still struggled to be in his presence, but I managed to keep it under control and pay attention to him.I noticed how Hermione, in front of me, grabbed my hand, nervously, and I caressed hers trying to pass her my support and my calm — even though I have to admit I was also quite scared."We'll go in pairs, except for Tonks and Ron that will be a trio thanks to Arambella for Tonks's protection," Moody kept explaining, "That way if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be, they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one."There we go.Harry slowly opened his eyes widely, trying to process the words."The real one?"Moody showed him the bottle where he kept the Polyjuice Potion. "I believe you're familiar with this particular brew."At first, Harry refused, since he considered it a too dangerous procedure."Harry, Ron's right," I intervened, keeping calm, "This isn't the first time we risk ourselves, but it is for a good reason. If we manage to confuse them and drive you safe out of here, we would win a huge advantage.""No, this is different. Taking that, becoming me...no.""None of us really fancy it, mate," Fred intervened with a soft tone, giving a playful look at Harry."Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever," George continued dramatically, making me chuckle.All of us nodded when Mad-Eye assured Harry that everyone had accepted to take the risk, except for one person, Mundungus Fletcher, the man being guarded by Kingsley."Are you sure we can trust this bloke?" I asked Remus, not too convinced."We don't have an option, dear,"I tightened my lips. I didn't think it was a good idea to have someone who wasn't from the Order being part of such an important mission as this one, especially when there was a huge risk of us being betrayed.Hermione took a piece of hair from Harry and put it inside the bottle, the potion started to work and soon Mad-Eye passed it to Fred's hands."For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning," Moody continued, "It tastes like goblin piss."Fred looked at it a bit disgusted and slightly hesitant. "Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?"The man stayed silent while still glaring at Fred."Just trying to diffuse the tension," the ginger added, giving me a quick look and winking at me as he gave a sip to the potion.They passed the bottle and soon we had seven Harrys in the place were Fred, George, Ron, Fleur, Hermione, Harry himself and that Mundungus man stood before."Wow, we're identical!" Fred and George burst out at the same time.I had to take my hand to my mouth in order not to laugh at the situation.The Harrys had to start undressing so they could put on the same clothes the real Harry was wearing."Don't drool too much, beautiful," Fred's voice in Harry's body teased me while he took off his shirt and pulled down his trousers. The image was so bizarre that I couldn't help but giggle."Don't worry, Freddie. I think this might be the first time I don't drool watching get undress.""Aha, sure," he smirked."Freddie, please, I swear to Merlin this feels as if Harry was the one flirting with me," I snickered, "but the good thing is that this is the first time too I'm taller than you."He scowled, slightly offended, "Oi, don't get too excited! You're barely two inches taller than Harry."They kept getting ready, changing their clothes and looking more like Harry. Moody started to explain to us the instructions we had to follow and how we will divide in pairs — trio, for Tonks, Ron and me.We hurried up outside, getting our brooms and the Threstals ready."Be sure you two take care, ok,?" Remus murmured at Tonks and me, leaving a quick kiss on Dora's lips and another one on my forehead while we nodded."Ready, Ron?" I smiled at him while preparing my broom. He, also in Harry's body, nodded quite excited but also nervous, taking deep breathes."Yeah — I think so," he finally managed to say, "Can't be that bad, can it?""Nah, you'll see everything will be a'right."I noticed how someone smacked my bum behind me and when I looked behind me I found Ha- I mean, Fred, giving me one of his mischievous looks and getting on his broom."You better arrive at the Burrow safe and sound, Arambella.""I tell you the same, Potter, " I teased him, giving him a little wink and hearing both Remus and George chuckling next to him.Fred rolled his eyes and got next to his dad who was going to be his protector.I got next to Tonks and Ron, with the night wind striking my hair and feeling the blood in my veins running high in adrenaline. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to remain calm and clear my thoughts."Head for the Burrows," Moody announced. "We'll rendezvous there. On the count of three."I gripped my broom harshly, making my knuckles turn white and feeling the excitement all over my body."Ready for the party, lads," Tonks ironized."One...two...three!""Let's go!" I whispered to them, starting to fly and being followed by the rest who tried to remain close to each other.The grey mist blinded us slightly but we managed to keep Ron in between Tonks and me as we were going high in between the clouds. For a brief moment, it seemed as everything was calm, but sooner some light flew towards us."Oh, shit!" I took my wand out of my boot and started pointing at the black shadows. "EVERYONE, WANDS OUT!""WHICH ONE?" I heard some Death Eater shout."WHERE ARE YOU?!""Ron, stay between us, a'right?!" Tonks protected the boy, getting her wand out as well and trying to avoid the curses thrown by the Death Eaters. I positioned close to her, making sure she was also protected, and from my position, I could recognise some of the Death Eaters that were attacking us."HE'S ON YOUR RIGHT!""Shit!" I heard Kingsley complain, trying to get Hermione out of Dolohov's sight."HE'S OVER THERE!""Let's go, let's go, we can't stop!" I tried to make a path in between the fog and the shadows for Ron and Tonks to fly. Moody let pretty clear how the main objective was to get as many of us safe to the Burrow. While Tonks and Ron kept flying, trying to avoid the curses, my eyes went straight to look for Fred in between the storm covering us. He was throwing one of his hexes to Yaxley, making him almost fall from his broom while his dad tried to get him out of there.I tried to keep flying, going back to Tonks and Ron but I saw a familiar face next to the Death Eaters. Severus. My body froze on my broom when I recognised him and I felt the pity and sorrow covering me from up to down. I didn't want to admit he was one of the bad guys and that he had been one of them this entire time. I really didn't.Those thoughts were spurned away when I hexed one of the Death Eaters trying to attack Ron and drove his attention to me, before I could even move, he gripped my leg trying to drag me with him back to Severus."Snape, look!" he shouted with pure excitement and fanaticism, digging his dirty fingers on my skin as I tried to curse him. "Your beautiful niece is also here."I tried to move from his grip as I managed to keep the balance on my broom. "GET OFF ME, YOU FILTHY DICKHEAD!"Severus looked at me with deadpan eyes but I noticed how his skin became paler. I gasped when I saw how he pointed with his wand at me. Was he going to kill me now that I knew he was one of them?"Go on," I spat, encouraging him, writhing from the other man's touch, "Curse me. After all, you can't fail me more than you already have.""Shut up, Lilith," he replied with a dry tone. Without waiting any longer, I moved my arm, making my elbow crash into the man's nose and getting off his grip but before I could even fly away, Severus's wand moved, I noticed someone crashing into the man who trapped me, moving him away from me at the same time the words came out of Severus's mouth;"Hands off her!""Sectumsempra! " the white light hit my saviour and George's scream filled the air."NO!" I screamed when I noticed it was him the one who received the curse."GEORGE!" I heard Remus shouting as well, since he was his protector, and flying straight towards us. "DOWN!"Before I could attack him, Snape flew away from us, leaving me with a hurt George.The curse made him feel dizzy as the blood from his cut ear started to flow down his body. Before letting him fall from his broom, I managed to catch him in the air, struggling to hold him and trying to stop a fall that would probably end in his immediate death."C'mon, Georgie," I stuttered, putting more effort to sit him on my broom as his blood covered the two of us. "Oh, mate, why did you have to do that? Look at your ear!"Remus flew next to me, helping me to hold George and putting the boy's arm over his shoulder."Georgie, please, keep your eyes open, a'right? I know the counter-spell for the curse but I need you to arrive at the Burrow awake.""Dear, we have to get him out of here now," Remus said, managing to fly away from all the action. I clicked my tongue."Kingsley! 'Mione!" they briefly looked at me as I kept dragging George, "Keep an eye on Ron and Tonks, please!""Don't worry!" Hermione, still in Harry's body, smiled nervously and nodded at me."Am I dreaming?" George's soft and sleepy voice hallucinated as Remus and I kept carrying him.We flew back to the floor, putting our brooms away - right now, they didn't matter at all. Managing not to be seen from the sky, we made George stand up and put his arms over our shoulders to move him faster. His ear kept bleeding and I gasped loudly when I noticed there wasn't any ear at all, it was just a bleeding hole. Fucking shit, I'm gonna be able to stop the haemorrhage but his ear is not going to grow back."We need to appear!" Remus said, slightly out of breath while I nodded. We appeared at the start of the wheat field, right in front of the Burrow."Here!" Remus shouted, calling Ginny's and one of the Harrys's attention. He immediately ran to us, helping us to move George, who was now in his normal form, inside the Burrow. We let the poor ginger boy lay on the couch and soon, both Molly and I started to work on his bleeding ear"He was hit by a Sectumsempra," I informed, swallowing hard, "It was directed to me but he took it instead, it's my fault."I saw Mrs Weasley tightening her lips, "Don't worry, dear. It's not your fault, you weren't the one cursing him.""Not y-your - fault," George stuttered, looking at me with his eyes slightly closed.I gave him a little smile, "You know you saved my life, right?""Lilith, don't be so d-dramatic" George whispered drawling, giving me a sleepy and little smile, "Wanna hear something? - Now, I feel saint-like...because I'm holey."I couldn't help but chuckle. "Merlin's sake, George. You better tell that joke to your brother once he's here." The ginger managed to nod, with a dim smile on his face."Voldemort knew you were going to be moved here tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an impostor," Remus informed Harry after questioning him, pretty much out-of-breath. Apparently, he was the real Harry.Under their curious looks, I performed the only spell that was able to stop fast enough the haemorrhage produced by a Sectumsempra. My uncle's curse was one of the deathliest ones and even though there were some spells to mend it, being a Snape had the advantage of knowing the definitive counter-spell that fixed it."That's it," I said, standing up from the floor, "We can't grow back your ear but at least you aren't bleeding anymore and you won't die bleeding out.""Thanks, mate," he murmured slowly."It's the least I could do, Georgie," I tutted, feeling incredibly bad for not being able to help him more. If we had had his lost ear, we could have sewed it back to his body and repaired the cut with the counter-spell, but since that wasn't the case, we couldn't do anything more than stop the bleeding.The sound of someone else appearing outside was suddenly heard and while Mrs Weasley continued cuddling her son and making sure he was still awake, and Ginny looked for clean bandages and rags to clean his dry blood, Remus, Harry and I went outside to check who had arrived.Hermione, now also in her normal look, hugged Harry tightly while Kingsley and Lupin made sure none of them had been the one betraying Harry. The Potter boy informed Kingsley that what gave him away was his owl, Hedwig.Of course, we didn't think about that. Shit.Bill and Fleur appeared on their Threstal, followed by Tonks and Ron."You alright?" I asked the two of them while Hermione ran to hug the boy."Yes, brilliant he was. I wouldn't stand here without him." Tonks replied, hugging Remus."That's my mate!" I high-fived Ron.The golden trio fused into a tight hug, being happy that, at least, the three of them were safe and sound.Right then, Fred - in his normal form too - appeared with Mr Weasley, who put his arm over the boy's shoulder congratulating him. Fred took off Harry's glasses in a single move with his eyes shining with a determination and fierceness that drove shivers all over my body. Still trying to catch back his breath, his eyes met mine and he immediately came walking towards me. Before I could say a word, he pulled me closer to his body and dragged me into a tight hug that let me breathe his scent and feel his touch around me. Feeling safer than ever."Good to know you know how to follow orders, angel," he whispered, pretty out-of-breath, stroking my back."Only when my life depends on it," I whispered, hugging him even tighter. Oh, Merlin, only to think I could have lost him... "Good to know you know how to stay alive.""Well, you aren't getting rid of me anytime soon, Lilith," he snickered. "Where's George?"I opened my eyes widely, noticing that he didn't know about Georgie being hurt. When he saw I wasn't able to reply, he became paler and ran inside the house, being followed by me and by Arthur.Fred quickly kneeled in front of his brother, while Molly kept stroking George's hair, trying to keep him awake."What happened?" Fred asked, genuinely concerned but keeping his soft tone."He-" I started to speak, gulping. "My uncle was about to curse me with the Sectumsempra but George got in the middle, saving me, and receiving the curse. I'm sorry, Freddie, it's my fault.""Lilith..." I heard how George tutted in a slow voice, warning me."I applied him the counter-spell, though. He won't grow back his ear but at least he is not dying." I continued, slightly scared at what could be Fred's reaction. If there was someone who mattered the entire whole world to Fred, that was George."It's not your fault, Lilith," Fred said while looking at his twin, sounding honest. "We knew the risks this could have. How're you feeling, Georgie?"George opened his eyes briefly and looked at me giving an almost unnoticeable wink. "Saint-like,"Oh, Merlin. I bit my lip to hid the smile forming on my face."Come again?" Fred asked, confused."Saint-like. I'm holy," George repeated, "I'm holey, Fred. You get it?"Fred smiled, licking his lips and slightly shaking his head. "The whole wide world of ear-related humour and you go for 'I'm holey'," he looked at his twin, silently thanking that he was alright. "That's pathetic."George's smile became a little bit bigger."Reckon I'm still better-looking than you."

Mad-Eye Moody was dead.Those bastards attacked him thinking he would be the one guarding Harry. We were betrayed. I can't say the Auror's death meant something to me, because, obviously, it didn't, but the emotional rollercoaster felt on the house was enough to have my nerves on edge.It didn't matter anymore, the mission was done and Harry was safe.Once we finally cleaned George's wound, he recovered pretty quickly, in fact, he was completely normal a few hours later as if he hadn't lost an ear at all - except for the obvious jokes that he was starting to make. As soon as Liv and Pauline knew about George's accident, they appeared outside the Burrow, and soon, we five were sitting in the living room with the warm fire in the chimney covering us and chatting in a low voice."Bloody hell, George!" Liv giggled after the ginger made another joke about his lack of ear, making us giggle. She was incredibly worried about him when she arrived, especially because I knew that they had become a huge support for each other and really valued their friendship and bond.I laid on the floor with my head on Liv's lap and Pauline playing with the rings on my fingers as I kept listening to their conversation;"Why are you so silent, babe?" Lin asked me, a bit puzzled. I couldn't help but sigh."I feel bad for George's wound—" they were about to interrupt me saying that it wasn't my fault so I quickly cut them off, "I know that technically it wasn't my fault but...I still can't believe that Severus was about to curse me. And what's worse, he was going to curse me with our family curse."Fred looked at me with a bit of pity in his eyes;"Do you think he really wanted to kill you?"I meditated his words before replying; "Probably. He knows that the Sectumsempra can be deathly and, if he had hit me, I wouldn't have been able to put on the counter-spell in the air nor arrive at the Burrow without bleeding out. George was lucky he got hit in his ear, otherwise...""I can't believe he actually dared to do this," Liv shook her head with a clear expression of despise on her face. "I mean, you know Severus has never been my cup of tea but I genuinely thought he cared a little bit about you.""That man fooled all of us," Pauline added, pursing her lips with disdain.✵ ✵ ✵The next couple of days, we focused on having things ready for the wedding. Fleur was incredibly nervous but with our support and her family's — who had arrived from France a day ago — she was being way more comfortable.The night before the great day, we girls decided to gather together in Bill and Fleur's room to give the bride a proper little hen party. Kicking out the boys and enchanting the room so no one could hear what was happening inside, we painted our nails, did our hair, chatted, got a bit hammered and high, and ended up dancing in the middle of the room.It turned out Fleur's cousins and friends weren't as posh and fancy as I thought them to be at first, actually, her cousin Coraline — quite tall, beautiful curves, strawberry blonde hair, brown eyes and east-Asian features mixed with that French aristocratic look — called my attention and if I hadn't been so in love with Fred, I wouldn't have minded having a bit of time alone with her."So, Fleur," one of her cousins started to then give a sip to her beer with a mischievous smirk. We had decided to play a drinking game where we had to answer burning questions or drink a beer down in just one sip, and now it was the bride's turn. "How's Bill in bed?"Ginny clicked her tongue trying to hold back her laughter, "Oh Godric's balls, no, please, he's my brother.""Then cover your ears," Hermione burst out, too curious about Fleur's reply, with her cheeks red and her pupils dilated, slightly pushing the ginger girl."'Mione!" Pauline giggled, surprised at the Granger girl's attitude."Well," Fleur started, snickering, making us pay attention, "He's really good, and lasts way more than any of my previous partners. Besides, he...really focuses on my pleasure before his.""Bloody Weasleys..." I sighed, chuckling " it wasn't enough for them to look as if they fucking handcrafted by the Gods but also they had to fuck so bloody good...""AH! THEY ARE MY BROTHERS!" Ginny giggled, covering her ears and leaning down on the floor."Love, it is what it is.""How would you feel if I was talking like that about Liv and Pauline," she joked, trying to mess with me, stumbling with her own words."Bold of you to assume I haven't heard these two having sex when my room is literally next to theirs. I already know they are two horny bitches," I shrugged while Pauline hid her face in Liv's neck, snickering, and the blonde shrugged too as if she couldn't give any less of a fuck."Next question," now it was Coraline's turn to talk, her eyes went straight to me, "Lilith, right?"I nodded, trying to hold back my smile."If you weren't in that...thing you are with Bill's brother, " she started with a little smirk, " who from this house would you shag?"I arched both my eyebrows quite surprised at the question but without erasing my smile."Oh, c'mon, we all know I'm the next one on Lilith's list after Fred!" Hermione popped off, quite obvious, rolling her eyes and giving another sip to her drink.While the French girls looked at her surprised, Liv, Pauline, Ginny, Fleur and I chuckled at the same time. Who would have guessed drunk Granger was this bold?"Maybe, but I'd like to hear her response," the other girl smiled, still looking at me.When I was about to reply, I heard a little knock behind the door."George shut the fuck up, I wanna hear her answer!" Fred's hushed voice spoke."Well, in case you have forgotten, I have to put this other ear against the door to hear something because I don't have any other ear, you fucking tosser."All of us had a feline smirk on our faces as I stood up, ready to open the door and catch them. As I opened it, they almost fell inside the room since they were holding an Extendable Ear glued to the door so they could hear our conversation."What are you two doing?" I scoffed, arching one of my eyebrows."Hi, Lilith!" George said with a bandage around his head, covering his missing ear, and his usual smile, as if I hadn't just caught them."Hello, Georgie.""Darling-" Fred started, trying to give me one of his piercing and charming looks."What are you doing, Freddie? We have enchanted the room so you can't hear anything," I interrupted him, "Besides, you should be in Bill's hen party.""You forgot to enchant it against the Weasley products, mate," George replied, quite proud.Fred made a little pout; "We are bored with Bill. They had a couple of bears and now are just listening to Charlie talking about his dragons. We want to have fun with you lot.""But this is a girls-only party, darling.""Oh, c'mon, Lilith," George pouted as well, "we are already used to have fun with you, Liv and Lin. You can't leave us in the lurch!"He directed his puppy eyes to Fleur."Please, beautiful sister-in-law, we promise we won't bother!"Fleur giggled, I saw how two of her cousins were playing with their hair while trying to give seductive looks to the twins as they encouraged Fleur to let them in. I felt someone's eyes on me and I found Coraline smiling. She pointed at those two girls and rolled her, showing how she didn't like them too much, and making me chuckle."C'est bon, come in," Fleur finally gave up.They whooped excited and entered the room, closing the door behind them and quickly sitting in the circle we were doing on the floor."What are you doing, Ginny?" Fred tried to take her beer from her, trying to act as a responsible older brother - when actually he just wanted to drink it himself. I knew my Freddie - to what Ginny replied moving from him and drinking the beer in front of his face slowly but in just one sip.Fred clicked his tongue and made appear two beers. Giving a long sip to his, he simply smiled at us;"Well, ladies, where were we?"We snickered, going back to the drinking games but switching to truth or dare:"Let's start with truth," I said, being the first one since I didn't get to finish my round on the previous game."Oh, I got this one!" Liv quickly spoke, looking at me with a mischievous smile. Shit, I was fucked up..."Olivia..." I warned her, without being able to hold back my smile. She snickered devilishly."Is it true that when we went to Leeds, you had a little accident with that boy you were snogging?" she started, making everyone's eyes focus on me, "And with his girlfriend?"Leeds? I tried to think...Oh, shit. This fucking bitch.I couldn't help but burst into laughter. "Yes!""And do you mind telling us what happened?" Lin continued, standing with her girlfriend and narrowing her eyes while she smiled."Lilith?" Fleur encouraged me, imitating my friend's mischievous smile.I pretended to sigh. "I sneezed in his face right when I was about to kiss him,"They all whistled surprised and giggled."That's not all," Liv added, giving a sip to her beer."...I kissed him, anyway.""EW!" Fred and George said at the same time as the rest burst into laughter."AND?!" Liv encouraged me and I rolled my eyes, already giggling."And then I shagged his girlfriend in the club's loo!" I concluded, giving up and laughing as well.Hermione, Ginny, Fleur and Pauline started whooping as the rest clapped, surprised."Wow..." Fred smiled, surprised."She was my last fuck before you," I confessed to him in a little murmur."Lilith, mate, I swear to Merlin you're my fucking idol!" Ginny giggled."I still don't know how you managed to do all that," Liv chuckled, drinking her beer."Says the one who had one threesome and a half in just one night!" I pointed out, making her almost spit her drink as Pauline burst into laughter."And a half?" Coraline asked, confused but also giggling."Yes, one of the girls stopped in the middle of the fuck saying she actually had a girlfriend!" the Bélier girl added, knowing the story and being too comfortable and confident in their relationship to know this sort of things about Liv and not get mad or insecure."Exactly!""You two are bonding to embarrass me," Olivia pretended to wipe off one a tear. "Georgie, come here, you are the only one who treats me properly."George threw himself into Liv's arms, making the two of them fall laying on the ground, laughing.By the end of the night, we had confessed some good secrets and stories — that would probably be forgotten by tomorrow early in the morning because of how wasted we got — and done dares that even included magic. Hermione and I went back to our dorm still giggling and trying to hush each other not to wake up the rest of the house.Ah, bloody hell, I had missed this kind of fun!✵ ✵ ✵"Merlin's right ball! Can someone tell me why the Minister of Magic himself is in the house?" I asked surprised going outside to meet Fred, George, Ron and Arthur, who were helping to put up the huge marquee where the wedding would take place."Apparently, he is here to give Harry, Ron and Hermione Dumbledore's testament," Mr Weasley replied as if it was the most common thing on Earth.I looked at him a bit puzzled... nevermind, the less I know, the better."So they finally kissed?" I heard Fred asking George as I approached them."Yeah, it was a bit awkward, y'know? Especially when they noticed I was there,""And what did you tell them?" Fred giggled."I only said 'Mooorning'," the other boy shrugged, amused. "You should've seen Harry's face!""Need help, boys?" I asked them once I got by their side. Both twins turned around to look at me."Nah, darling, 's okay," Fred quickly said, giving me a wholesome smile."You and the rest of the girls should start getting ready, mate," George piped up, smiling mischievously, "If you aren't too hungover, of course.""Bah! As if you didn't drink down an entire bottle of whiskey by your own!" I replied, giggling.The boy pretended to look arrogantly at me, "Yeah, but here you see me, in one piece.""Yeah, except for your ear.""Exactly."I smiled and finally went back inside the home, ready to change into the wedding clothes. Liv left early in the morning to pick up her dad and Luna — since they were also invited to the wedding — and Pauline was helping Fleur to get ready since she was one of her bridesmaids.Since Hermione was probably helping Ginny and Mrs Weasley with their dresses, I found our dorm completely empty, so I got rid of all my clothes and after having a refreshing shower, I took out my dress.I decided that I would wear the dark green dress made of sateen that Draco bought me for my 18s so I could have the chance to wear it for the first time. When I put it on, I felt the rich, smooth and silky fabric sliding down my skin like a soft and slow waterfall. It adapted to my body perfectly, giving me all the free movement I wanted.The simple but elegant dark green fabric covered my silhouette, reaching the floor but leaving a good opening in my leg that went up till right below my hip bone, my back was half-naked and two tiny thin straps were the only thing on my shoulders, showing off a pretty neckline. The dress adjusted softly to my breasts, my hips and my waist in such a beautiful way that I almost felt like a goddess.Bloody hell, Draco, I swear to Merlin I fucking love you so much!"Wow..." I heard a familiar masculine voice behind me. Through the mirror, I saw Fred leaning against the door's frame and running his eyes all over my body as his mouth slightly opened, surprised. I couldn't help but smirk."Am I looking good?"He arched his eyebrows, still speechless."I mean— I can't even speak right now, Lilith. My mind is fully occupied by this dress and this dress only," he murmured approaching me. He stood right behind me, already in his suit looking like too fucking good to be real, letting me feel his corporal warmth behind me. Still admiring my body his hand wrapped around my waist to glue my back to his chest as his lips met my neck slowly. "You look so bloody beautiful, darling. What a lucky man I'm gonna be tonight.""You look great too," I whispered, caressing his hand on my abdomen and giving him a feline look through the mirror."I'm gonna have some thoughts about you during the wedding and none of them is gonna be innocent," he joked, biting softly the skin in my collarbone. "Hope you know that," he smacked my bum.I couldn't help but snicker. "Thank you, but I'm not ready yet. I have to do my hair and put some make-up on.""Not that my opinion matters, but I think your hair like this suits you well enough," He made me turn around to look at him while putting one of his hands in the pockets of his trousers and moving the other one to my back. "These curls are too beautiful for you not to show them off.""A'right. But I still wanna put some make-up on, though,""Oh, can I help you?" He asked like a little kid, surprising me."Sure!"We sat on my bed and quickly took out all my make-up products. Once we were done, Fred looked at me quite astonished and I couldn't help but feel the butterflies going crazy in my stomach."Bloody hell, woman..." he whispered, piercing me with his intense and full of desire stare. "How can you be so fucking beautiful?"I smiled, quite flustered and flattered, and before I could notice, he gripped my neck, making me lay down on the bed and positioning himself on top of me in between my legs."What are you doing, darling?" I teased him, arching one of my eyebrows."We can skip the start of the wedding," he purred in a deep voice, spreading slow and soft kisses all over my collarbones and neck.I giggled, quite turned on, moving my hips slightly against him."FRED! LILITH! WHERE ARE YOU? MUM'S WAITING FOR YOU TWO! " We heard Ginny's voice calling us from the living room."Fuck," Fred sighed, letting out a single chuckle, and moving from me not too happy about it."I suppose our fun will have to wait," I smiled at him, and he smirked."Aha, but not for too long, darling. You can be sure of that," Fred whispered to then leave a quick and little kiss on my lips.

Fred interlaced his arm with mine as he guided me out of the home, ready to walk together to the huge white marquee where everything was ready for the wedding and the guests were slowly arriving. Once inside, the Irish music filled the ambience of the summer evening and everyone was trying to find the perfect place to watch the ceremony.Mrs Weasley had worked a lot for this big day; she even hired white-robed waiters and a golden-jacketed band that welcomed us with their beautiful music."Ready for the party, darling?" Fred whispered next to me while we approached the group formed by Ron, Liv, Harry and George.I nodded at him with a little smile on my face, admiring how incredibly handsome he was looking, and feeling the luckiest woman on Earth for being next to him."S'up, lot," he greeted the rest of the group, "Already bored?""Sort of, we've been helping Mrs Weasley with all the last details," Harry said, welcoming us with a tired dim smile. Lately, he didn't seem to be pretty happy or excited about anything whatsoever, but, to be fair, who could blame the poor boy? "Lilith, wow! You look amazing!""Thanks, Harry! You and Ron look great too!" I smiled at them. Both of them were wearing suit way more suitable than the ones they wore during the Yule Ball two years ago. My eyes focused on Liv for a moment, she was wearing a beautiful baby blue dress that suited her hair colour and her eyes, making them stand out even more."Where's Lin?" I asked her, quite surprised."She's with Fleur and with Mrs Weasley. She was about to put on the dress she brought in France but Mrs Weasley insisted on making all the bridesmaids wear the same colour so she had to change into a pink one. Fleur agreed with Mrs Weasley only to make her happy."Fred snorted, smiling."When I get married, I won't be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I'll put a full Body-Bind Curse on mum until it's all over."When he gets married...

Oh, dear Merlin, the things I would do to be in his future wife's place."She wasn't too bad this morning, considering," said George, shrugging, "she cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh, blimey, brace yourselves - here they come, look."He pointed out the exotic flowers and bewitched birds announcing the entrance of the Delacour family. The short parade being closed by Fleur's cousins, obvs, Coraline included. She was looking gorgeous, with a beautiful light pink dress since she was one of the bridesmaids as well. She smiled mysteriously at me as soon as she saw us while George was slightly forced to guide the French girls to their places."Wotcher, lads" Remus and Tonks greeted us from the distance as I felt Fred's hand wrapping around my waist again. I looked at him quite puzzled and he smiled;"Don't want my accompanying to get lost tonight," he whispered."Lilith, my dear, you look stunning!" Remus complimented me, giving me a huge hug and leaving a kiss on my forehead as Dora winked at me. "All of you are!""Remus, love..." Dora murmured as if she was warning him."Oops, yes, sorry," the man replied, making his smile fade away a little bit and standing a couple of steps away from us."What's going on?" I asked, confused.Dora sighed, "The Ministry's being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we don't want to put you in danger or make you a target."I heard how Liv snorted before I could reply; "Dora, I think all of us are already targets to the Ministry.""Livie, dear," a tall man entering the marquee approached us patiently and slightly clueless. He was quite thin, slightly eye-crossed, shoulder-length white hair, quite eccentric yellow robes and the familiar symbol of the Deathly Hallows hanging from his neck in a little necklace. Xenophillus Lovegood. "I've been looking for you.""Oh, Dad, I was waiting for you here, as you asked me before" Olivia replied with a soft voice, "Where's Luna?""Probably lingering in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes," he replied. "Oh, Lilith, dear, you have grown up a lot! How are you?""Hello, Mr Lovegood. Quite well, thank you for asking," I smiled at the man and he nodded. I think I would never be thankful enough to him for how he always included me in his family and his house whenever I visited Liv."By the way, dear," he said, addressing his daughter again, "I just met your friend, Harry Potter. Quite an odd lad, isn't he?"I had to tighten my lips at how ironic was that someone as eccentric as Xenophillus was cataloguing someone like Harry as 'odd'. Liv's smile widened."Yeah, kind of."We decided to get out for a moment, before Fleur arrived, to have a little fresh air and soon Hermione appeared in our sight, making Ron almost drop his jaw when he saw how beautiful she was looking. Grager had chosen a gorgeous lilac dress and arrived towards us complaining about one of the Weasleys' aunts."Don't take it too personally," Ron said, "She's rude to everyone.""Muriel? Yeah, she just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish uncle Bilius was still with us; he was fun at weddings," George added."Wasn't he the one you told me who died after seeing the Grim?" Liv asked, surprised."He went a bit odd towards the end," he conceded."But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party," Fred smiled, "He used to down an entire bottle of firewhiskey, run to the dancefloor, " that wasn't that exceptional, I do that too and no one considers me odd, do they? "hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his -""He sounds a real charmer," Hermione interrupted him, while Harry, Liv and I burst into laughter.Bloody hell, Weasleys."Never married, for some reason," Ron added."Yeah, can't understand why a man who can pull flowers out of Merlin knows which part of his body never married," I ironized."Right?!" Ron said, not catching my sarcasm.I snickered, "Well, lot, before this thing starts, I need a drink."Fred's hand moved from my waist to my hips. "Mind bring me one as well?""Sure," I replied while he softly smacked my bum as I entered the marquee again.Going straight to the place where the drinks were exposed and recognising some of the guests, I took a cup of one of the fanciest champagnes I ever tasted, provided by Pauline's family as a wedding gift."Quite nice the ambience, huh?" I heard a feminine voice behind me, making me turn around and find a smiley Coraline."Everyone put a lot of effort in it," I agreed with her, "You look great, by the way,"She giggled, "Thank you, but to be honest I wouldn't have chosen this dress by myself. I wanted to put on a golden one but Fleur's mum-in-law insisted on having all of us dressed in pink."I arched my eyebrows. To be fair, it didn't surprise me."Still looks good."Her smile widened into a more seductive one, meditating her words, she finally drawled;"I wasn't going to say this, but considering how good you look today, I can't keep it to myself; I know you are in this weird bond with this Fred boy, but, if you ever happen to want to change a little bit and try something new - just send me an owl. We can have a bit of fun together."This time I was the one giggling. She was incredibly attractive, that was for sure, but there was no person able to make me move on from Fred. Not in this lifetime, at least. My eyes rambled briefly to the opened curtain of the marquee, where he was still chatting with our group. How could I even think of changing him, if he was the air I breathed? "Thanks for the offer, Coraline, but I'm doing well at the moment," I said as polite as possible."Well, yeah, I can tell so," she snickered again, "Can't deny that Fred is really attractive. You do have a good taste,"We kept chatting for a couple of minutes, and by the time I went back to joining Fred and the rest, Bill was about to make his great entrance being announced by Ginny and Gabrielle, who were the only ones allowed to wear a different colour than pink. As the bridesmaids started to enter the place too, I saw Pauline with a huge smile on her face, waving at us, rocking that pink dress hugging her beautiful curves and those beautiful braids in her hair.I sat next to the ginger, and even though I wanted to pay attention to the ceremony when it began, I couldn't help but have him strolling all over my mind. I looked at him from the corner of my eyes, feeling my entire body slightly flustered and boiling, admiring his profile as he paid attention. Change him...as if I could even think of someone else kissing me like he does, caressing me as he does or making me as happy as he does even without trying. The corners of Fred's lips twisted slightly in a dim and mischievous smile."Darling, I know I'm incredibly handsome and all that, but maybe you should pay a bit of attention to the ceremony," he scoffed in a whisper, taking me out of my daydream."Sorry," I simply murmured, being taken by surprise. "I dunno what I was thinking about.""Me, of course," he winked at me, making me smile. As we were listening to the bride and the groom saying their vows, I felt Fred's hand sneaking to my naked thigh and resting there as a warm, slow and possessive caress. I put my hand over his, stroking the back of it with my thumb.My Freddie.After going to congratulate Bill and Fleur on my own, I went back to the table where George, Angelina - who could arrive at the wedding right after work followed by Lee - Liv, Pauline, Fred and I had been grouped. After eating together, chatting and having some good laughs, the band started playing music again and suddenly the dancefloor was filled."C'mon, Livie, come with us," George and Fred dragged the blonde with them when a famous Irish song started playing right after Bill and Fleur had danced the traditional wedding waltz. Liv immediately agreed, Merlin knows Olivia loved being dragged by Fred and George into their fun.When the first notes of Killer Queen by Queen started to play, I felt someone touching my shoulder;"Would you give the honour, dear?" a smiley Remus offered me his hand.Without thinking twice, I accepted and soon we were dancing all over the dancefloor together, spinning around and laughing while being hyped up by the rest of the crowd."I'm so glad to see you this happy, Remus," I genuinely said, while Freddie Mercury's voice filled the place.His smile widened, "Well, even in the darkest times, we deserve a little bit of happiness, don't we, dear? And what better than sharing one of my favourite songs with my precious and beautiful daughter?"I hugged him tightly, feeling incredibly lucky to have someone as him as my paternal figure."I love you so much, Remus," I sincerely said, treasuring this moment in my mind."Love you too, lots!"By the time the song was finished, I wasn't even able to sit down again when I was dragged to the dancefloor again by Liv, Pauline and Angelina. I don't know at what moment the drinks affected me, but suddenly, I was dancing pretty close to all of them, making a weird sandwich and giggling with Lee himself guiding our movements and being the top of the sandwich.I really needed a moment like this with my friends.After a good couple of minutes, as the guests kept chatting and having fun, I went outside for a cigarette, breathing the warm night air and watching the stars shine dimly above us.As I was finishing the cig in silence, hearing the music as background, I felt someone's arms wrapping around me and a couple of familiar lips spreading soft and slow kisses all over my neck."Freddie..." I whispered, feeling his scent covering me."Yes, darling?" he murmured, still giving soft kisses to my exposed skin."Someone can see us...""I don't really care, you do?" he asked, playfully moving his hands to my hips. "This bloody dress is driving me crazy, Lilith, you can't imagine how badly I want to get under it and show you what you provoke in me."This time I couldn't hold myself anymore, I turned around to face him and give him a feline smile;"Then, what are you waiting for?"He bit his lower lip, smiling and hissing to playing it down, he gripped my neck and kissed me as sinfully and burning as I wanted him to do. Surrounding my waist with his arms Fred made me walk backwards, guiding me far from the marquee."Where are we going?" I whispered, against his lips, putting my hands in his hair to drag him even closer to me."To an empty place," he simply replied, already desperate, cupping my bum to make me jump and surround his hips with my legs. Fred panted loudly against my lips as he kept kissing me and claiming as much of me as he could.We arrived at a lonely tiny hut where Mrs Weasley used to keep her gardening items. My ginger opened the door without looking, with me still glued at him, desperate to feel him again after more than a week without it.He was about to slam me against the wall when my back collided against something - someone else, more like."Olivia?!" I asked, surprised, watching my best friend ran her hand through her chin covered in Pauline's lipstick as the Bélier girl looked at us, completely astonished."What are you two doing here?" she asked, surprised."We wanted to have a moment alone," Fred giggled while I put my feet back to the floor. Before I could move, he put his hand in my lower back to press me against his body, using mine to discreetly hide his growing erection from the girls."Well, we arrived first here," Pauline shrugged, amused."And what in Merlin's sake are you two doing here?" Fred arched one of his eyebrows, smiling."I'm fixing her dress," Liv rolled her eyes, sarcastic, "What do you think we are doing, mate?"Fred choked with his own saliva."A'right, a'right," I interrupted, snickering, "We're leaving."I trapped Fred's hand in mine and guided him out of there."Shit," I said quite disappointed after closing the door behind me. I genuinely wanted to be with him. "I s'pose we'll have to go back to the party."Fred giggled, shaking his head. "Oh, no, darling. Come with me, I know another place."

Fred slammed me against the wall, fusing his lips with mine in another demanding and desperate kiss.He had found the empty and lonely garage built with huge doors next to his house where they used to keep their car.Without waiting, he cupped my bum, pressing me against his body and kissing me as fierce and intense as he always did. I don't know how he managed to claim me that much, to make me this weak, to make me his with only kissing me.His hands travelled all over my sensitive skin to sneak below my dress and caress my thighs as my back adhered to the dusty wood, creating a contrast between his soft touch and the rusty cold material against my naked back. I held my breath at the feeling of his warm touch."As much as I want to fuck you in every way possible," he whispered against my lips, starting to pull down my underwear as I kinda unbuttoned his shirt, quite desperate. "I bet we're already being missed at the wedding, so this will have to be a quickie, darling."I felt myself already craving him and soaking in anticipation."Then don't waste time and kiss me, daddy," I purred, watching how weak he got before my words, making me surround his hips with my legs. One of his hands made sure to hold me against the wall so I wouldn't slip while the other one sneaked in between my legs to caress my clit softly over my underwear, making me press the back of my head against the wall as soft pants left my lips."Already dripping, angel? So desperate for me?" he scoffed, running the back of his fingers through my wetness."How can I not when you are looking this bloody good, Freddie?" I smirked, kissing the exposed skin of his neck and chest, hearing him taking a deep and long breath as his finger moved, teasing my entrance while his thumb played with my clit.I moaned against him when I felt two of his fingers sliding inside of me, meeting my warmth in contrast with the sudden wind outside of the garage. Fred's touch felt demanding and burning, covering me with a current of pleasure that woke up every single nerve in my body. As I bit slowly his lower lip, making eye contact with him and watching that devilish smile filling his face, Fred pulled out his fingers of me, gaining my complaining sound. He lifted my dress up to have more access to me, staring piercingly into my eyes with a pleased smirk that showed me how much he enjoyed having me so at his feet."Shh, darling, daddy's gonna please you properly," Fred whispered against my lips, unbuttoning his trousers and freeing his erection, grinding his tip through my pussy. "Freddie, please—" I stuttered, feeling already desperate and my inside pulsating, wanting to have him again."Ah-ah, love, you know how to call me," he scoffed, teasing my entrance"Daddy, please," I managed to say. His smile widened as his hands dug into the skin of my hips and he pushed inside of me in a hard thrust, making me whimper and drowning his own moan in the skin of my neck. He filled me, stretching me and claiming me."Fuck, Lilith," he groaned in a raspy whisper, making me tremble at his touch when his hands squeezed my hips. "I've been wanting to do this since the moment I saw you with this dress," he thrust deeper, still slowly to let me feel all of him. I tilted my head back, with the goosebumps covering my sensitive skin. "I couldn't even focus on the wedding, only could think about the fucking walking temptation you are.""Daddy," I murmured, wanting him to move more."Yes, my love?" Fred scoffed, pounding as deep that his hips bones crashed against mine. The butterflies in my stomach turned into a hurricane when I heard how he called me, making me feel as if I was already reaching the bloody stars. "Faster, please," I pouted, pulling his hair and admiring the mischievous and proud smile that filled his face as he grazed his nose against mine."All you want, angel," Fred murmured, to immediately start pounding harder, rougher and faster, creating a bewitching melody around us that only made me want to fuse with him and never leave from in between his arms. He was astonishing in the most perfect and beautiful way possible.One of Fred's hands sneaked to the neckline of my dress to pull it down and expose my naked breast, admiring my silver piercings and practically drooling at the view."You aren't wearing any bra, huh?" he smiled, looking at me quite arrogantly.I tried to shake my head but the pressure on my hips turned me into such a mess that I barely could do anything but shake my head, gulping."Words, Lilith.""I c-couldn't, fuck!" I replied as I could, swallowing hard when I felt his tip already rubbing my weak spot. Fred started to spread soft kisses on my exposed skin as his thrusts slowed down, making me whimper and my body exploding for him."And why is so?" he teased, still amused."Because the dress— the straps are too thin, it would show."He nodded, sounding convinced and proceeded to run his tongue all over my nipple, trapping the soft flesh in between his teeth and playing with my piercings, sending the most delicious shivers all over my spine."It wouldn't be because you wanted to provoke even more, right, darling?" he guessed, kissing softly the curve of my breast as he continued moving painfully slow inside of me."Maybe," I scoffed, "What if so, daddy?""Mmmh, you'd be a really bad girl, Lilith," he smirked, coming back to my mouth and thrusting harder. A loud moan left my lips when I felt him moving faster and rougher again. "Showing off this beautiful body in front of everyone when it's mine to admire," he whispered, spreading short slow kisses all over my face while his pounds kept ruining me at his mercy. "to praise — to fuck — and to worship.""Oh, Freddie," I whimpered, scratching his back over the clothes."But can't deny I love watching you show off in front of everyone," his eyes shined with mischief and complicity, "knowing that the lucky one who gets to be with you is me."Fred's hands gripped again my hips, with his dick throbbed inside of me as his breathing became more erratic and heavy. His eyes closed harshly when I clenched around him and a muffled moan left his lips as he tilted his head back, giving me a heavenly view to admire.He was the fucking perfection made as a man, sinfully and wryly perfect. Fred squeezed hard my bum, slamming me more against the wall when I grabbed his chin to kiss him again, my nerves almost reaching the most delicious explosion of pleasure."I have tried every single drug on this planet at least once," he muttered, staring piercingly into my eyes with that smile that was worthy to die for, "but you, Lilith Arambella — you are, by fucking far, the most addictive one I ever tasted."Fucking shit. 

If he hadn't already made enough of a mess of me, he most definitely was absolutely ruining me right now."You will end up killing me one of these days, Frederick," I confessed, going straight to bite his lip as he pounded in with a particularly hard thrust, making me hiss with pleasure. Fred joined our lips again in a wet and consuming kiss as his dick felt like reaching every single part inside of me, stretching me and filling me so fucking delicious it was driving me mad.The heat in between our bodies, the sound of his hips crashing against mine, his soft grunts and whimpers of pleasure combined with mine and all of him claiming all of me, was the only thing it could go through my mind."Who's daddy's perfect favourite girl, darling?" he whispered, against my lips, digging his hands in my hips with the dull sound of his thrusts.I moved my hands to his neck where I scratched his skin, making him tilt his head back and let out a loud deep moan as his dick throbbed again inside of me. I wanted to mark him as mine. I wanted him to be mine. "I am," I muttered, grazing his lips with mine. Fred smiled and trapped my lower lip into his teeth, making me immediately burst when his thursts kept the same rough path as before."Fucking Merlin, Fred!" I collapsed into his arms in an immense orgasm that made my inner thighs feel covered in my own juices, and my heart racing in my chest as my mind was dizzily running up and down the rollercoaster. I whimpered, touching the stars with my fingertips and seeing literal fireworks in front of me.Fred hid his face in the space between my neck and my collarbone and with a few last messy thrusts, out of breath and whimpering, he finally came inside of me with a last raspy and deep moan;"Fucking hell, Lilith," he whispered, faltering voice, slowly and intensely releasing himself in my inside, slightly trembling with pure pleasure as I pulled his hair and clenched around him.Catching back our breaths, Fred pulled out of me with a tired but huge smile on his face. Luckily for me, he made appear some throwaway rags to clean ourselves."Shall we go back to the party as if nothing had happened?" Fred smirked, arching his eyebrows, playfully."Hang on a minute, did anything happen?" I ironized, following him, imitating his smirk."I don't think so," he winked at me, interlacing his hand with mine and getting us out of there. While we were on our way back to the marquee, we found Liv and Pauline, and surprisingly, George and Angie from another one of the huts, going back too. We walked together not without sharing an accomplice smile in that weird sort of walk of shame.Once inside the marquee, everyone was so entertained or wasted that no one seemed to have noticed our little escape. As soon as I set a foot on it again, Tonks dragged me to dance with her between giggles.A couple of hours later, my feet hurt because of how much I had danced with my friends, and my cheeks ached because of how much I had laughed till the point of having to wipe off one or two tears.When I was about to take a seat after being dragged to the dancefloor by George, I felt Fred's hands on my waist when a special slow song started playing; O Children by Nick Cave."Dance this one with me, darling," he murmured with a gentle grin.How can I say no to him?I let him guide me to the dancefloor, feeling my pounding heart hitting hard against my ribcage when he finally stopped, with his eyes on me. Fred pulled me closer to his body, letting me breathe his fragrance and stare into his deep brown eyes shining with a soft familiar sparkle that pierced me.A little smile appeared on his face as he interlaced his hand with mine and passed the other one around my waist, starting to slowly move at the rhythm of the beautiful song.There were no words needed between the two of us, our bodies were saying what our mouths couldn't.My heart melted so badly at the feeling of such an intimate touch and the view of him, that for a long minute, no one else but him existed in the entire world. I let my head rest on his chest as my entire body glued to his, enjoying the music. Merlin, how bad I craved to tell him how much I fucking loved him.Fred's breathing was paused and the sound of his heart against my ear felt calming and cosy as his warmth surrounded me. Nothing in this life could have made me happier at that moment. Hey, little train! Wait for me

I once was blind but now I seeThe touch of his hand on my naked back felt more intimate than ever and the closeness between our bodies was something that I wanted to carve into my memory and never forget.Have you left a seat for me?

Is that such a stretch of the imagination?My mind got trapped into one single thought as we continued dancing, feeling the beating of our hearts keeping in with the music at the same time; what if I finally confess my feelings for him out loud? What if I finally tell him that I love him?What if he actually, genuinely and honestly has also strong feelings for me? 

What if I managed to make him fall for me as much as I have fallen for him and I was just only wasting time with my silence?

Too many what if's, too little action.I pressed my cheek more against the fabric of his shirt, noticing how he took a deep breath and his thumb dimly — almost unnoticeably — stroked the curve of my back.I'm hanging in there, don't you see?

In this process of elimination.

Merlin's fucking sake, Lilith. Have balls for once in your life."Freddie..." I managed to murmur in a low and soft tone. He immediately looked at me, with his gorgeous brown eyes staring into me, thousands of words drowned in them, and his cheeks slightly redder because of the heat in the room, marking more the beautiful freckles forming a little tiny constellation in his skin. "I have something to tell you."His voice came out in the exact soft tone;"Yes, darling?"Hey, little train! We're all jumping on.

The train that goes to the kingdom.

We're happy, ma, we're having fun.

Beyond my wildest expectations.I gulped, feeling the security in his eyes. "Freddie, I —"Suddenly, a blue light impacted into the marquee, interrupting me and startling us, making more than one gasp loudly. I moved quite scared and Fred immediately pulled me against his body, protectively.A lynx, Kingsley's Patronus, took form from the blue bright light. Mr Weasley approached it, quite hesitant. Shackebolt's solemn voice filled the marquee as some images started to be portrayed;"The Ministry has fallen."Oh, no. My heart raced painfully and Fred's grip became tighter."Minister of magic — is dead."Fuck."They are coming," a simple hushed message, "They are coming."They are coming.

Death Eaters.

Fucking bloody hell, Merlin.

Everyone gasped and suddenly all the guests were trying to escape and disappear from the marquee. My eyes found quickly Hermione's and I grabbed her wrist, making her focus on me;"Go grab Harry and Ron and disappear from here," I told her, sounding more serious than ever, "You three are their main goal, we can distract them.""But— but you?" she stuttered, her eyes shining with worry."We'll be fine, hurry up, 'Mione!"She nodded and suddenly a black light burst inside the marquee, scaring the living shit out of us.Bloody hell."Hermione, now!" I told her, grabbing my wand and trying to redirect on the hexed thrown at her.The faces of the Death Eaters appeared in front of us with their superiority complex and their deadly smiles, ready to fight us. I saw how Harry tried to protect Ginny but Remus stopped him, forcing him to leave with Ron and Hermione. As soon as I made sure they had disappeared, I turned around ready to face those bloody bastards.My eyes distinguished Dolohov, Yaxley, Goyle and so many more that were already well known by the Order.I saw how one of the Lestrange brothers was about to curse Fred and, from the distance, I pointed my wand at him furiously.Not with my man, you fucking son of a bitch."EXPULSO!" I cursed out loud, making the filthy Death Eater blaze past and get knocked out against the ground.Some other Death Eaters around us seemed to recognise me because as soon as they saw me pointing at Lestrange, they approached me, and before I could attack them, one of them grabbed my hair violently, almost making me kneel on the floor."Look at that, it's Snape's baby," Avery scoffed, drawling with a hiss, glueing me to his body. "How beautiful Little Circe is, huh?""If she wasn't the Order's whore, she would have been such a good fuck, wouldn't she?" Selwin, laughed, histrionic.My breathing became heavier and messier as I gulped, feeling absolutely disgusted by those two."Hands off me, you blithering fucking knobs," I mumbled, with the rage burning in my veins."You think Circe would get mad if we have a little fun with her?" Avery pulled his face closer to mine, ignoring my words, sending chills of pure terror all over my body. "Even being a halfbreed, she'd worth the shag. She's only 19, imagine how tight and good she feels," he relished, staring straight into my eyes.Fucking disgusting.I was about to spit on his face when I heard a deafening voice, with pure fury flooding the words;"DARE TO REPEAT THAT TO MY FUCKING FACE, YOU SON OF A BITCH!" Fred burst, red of rage, coming at us by leaps and bounds with his fists clenched.The ginger pushed the man off me and before I could even react, Fred dealt such a punch on Avery's face that I heard how his jaw broke, knocking him out. Blind with rage, Weasley kneeled on the floor in front of the unconscious man to keep punching him, covering his hands and white knuckles with that filthy scumbag's blood. I was surprised by Fred's strength, almost forgetting that even though he was slightly lanky, he had been a Beater — and a good one — meaning that he had to be actually pretty strong.I pointed my wand at the other bastard next to Avery, but suddenly, a dim green light dot appeared over his head. He flinched for a second and his eyes shined hungrily, running away from me, avoiding the Reducto curse I threw at him.I saw how Dolohov and Rowle vanished and I immediately recognised what was happening.It was the curse that followed the mention of You-know-who's actual name.Fuck, the golden trio is in even more danger."Fred," I called him in a low whisper when I saw Yaxley interrupting everything starting to threaten some of the remaining guests.The ginger separated from Avery, pretty much out of breath and with his face stained with blood. The bloody Death Eater was still alive, though.Bad luck.Before going to protect my friends and Fred, I walked next to the unconscious bastard and lifting my leg, I gave a hard kick to his nose, breaking it with the heel of my shoe."Rapists are hung at Azkaban, Avery." I muttered, "The ropes don't deserve to get dirty with a scumbag's blood like yours, fucking bastard."Immediately, I felt someone approaching me quite slowly, like a lion looking at its prey, and Fred grabbed me by my wrist, pulling me behind him and glaring at the Death Eater who was approaching us with a smile;"Traitors" Yaxley greeted us, especially focusing on me, quite solemnly and with a calm tone, "What a lovely disgusting couple. It makes me wanna vomit."I huffed, ironic."What would mommy think of you, Little Circe?" he addressed me, sarcastic."Don't you dare to even talk to her," Fred warned, looking daggers at him.Yaxley snorted, "Well, I'm terribly sorry, blood traitor, but all of your family and all the guests in this room will have to be subdued to an interrogatory at the Ministry. We can't let this offence pass! ""What fucking offence?" I spat, feeling my blood boiling."The fact that you have unregistered half-bloods and mudbloods in this wedding," he stated, solemnly. "Take them," he ordered to his stupid servants.Without any other word, they trapped us. I felt my stomach shrinking at the feeling of dizziness that came with the apparition spell, and it shrank, even more, when we appeared again at the Ministry's headquarters. Immediately, they practically dragged us to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, under the satisfied eyes of Pius Thicknesse — the new Minister after Scrimgeour's death — and the fucking pink foul bitch of Umbridge.It had passed more than a year since the last time I saw her, and nothing had changed in her appearance, she still had that repulsive smile on her face that I wanted so badly to erase."I'll take care of the muggle-borns, if you'd let me, Minister," she spoke with that horribly posh accent and that high-pitched voice. For a moment, her eyes focused on me and she tilted her head to the left, "Yaxley can take care of the half-bloods and the traitors."We tried all to writhe from their grip but it was useless, not even Kingsley could do avoid the interrogation. It was the new law approved at the exact moment the previous Minister died.I looked at everyone working in that fucking room. It was all their fault.The Death Eaters had grown inside of the Ministry like a bloody parasite, right in front of their eyes, and they let those bastards gain all the power they wanted until there was no power left to take away from the Ministry. It was all theirs.Now, this was one of the reasons why I always considered blood supremacy to be a huge load of bullshit; they wanted to act as if the wizarding world was way superior to the muggle one, but at the end of the day, muggle or wizard, we were all humans and as humans, we were all exposed to corruption.And the Ministry was insanely corrupted."Arambella," Yaxley mumbled, with a malevolous and spiteful smile on his face, "Or should I call you Lupin?"Remus's tensed a few steps behind me and Fred's breathing became heavier."You're coming with me," he continued.Oh, fucking fuck my life.I saw how the guards separated Liv and Pauline from Xenophillus and Luna, much to the man's dismay who wanted desperately to protect his daughter. My eyes met Liv and Pauline for a second, they were trying to compile all the courage they could. I nodded at them, silently telling them we would be okay, and they returned me the nod. Ginny was about to be taken alone by Thicknesse himself but George almost begged them to let him go with her. He wasn't planning to let his little sister be alone with any of them. None of us was.We were finally divided into pairs, except for me and Fred. They wanted to interrogate him alone and that scared every part of me. Yaxley took me alone to his office, being followed by some of his henchmen. They made me violently sit on a metal chair in front of an empty wood table, with a light right in front of my face, just like in muggle films."Now, Lilith, right?" he stared pacing calmly all over the room.I didn't reply."I don't think I like your name," he stated, "Might call you Little Circe better."Silence."Would you care to tell me where did Potter go?" he hissed.I smiled at him, cynic. Not a single sound left my mouth."Oh, you don't want to speak, alright," he nodded, sitting on the chair in front of me. "we have two options then; either you speak and tell me everything you know and I let you out unharmed — or I call Greyback, who's in this same building, and order him to finish what Avery was about to start. Right here, in front of our eyes. Bet he would love the offer."I managed to hide how I gulped and how my skin got goosebumps at the only thought of being with Greyback in the same room."I bet mommy Circe wouldn't mind it," Yaxley added.Fucking disgusting."I don't have the slightest idea of where Harry is, and even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you," I simply drawled, keeping my calm but dry tone. "And you can go tell Greyback that the moment I see him, I'm ripping his eyes off his eyesockets with my bare hands. Tell him that I'll make him remember Lilith Lupin was the woman who destroyed him, and tell him that maybe Little Circe's face is the last thing he sees in his fucking life."Yaxley listened to me, with a piercing and deadpan stare. His serious face broke into a twisted and wicked smirk."You might be a filthy traitor," he muttered, "but you certainly have a Death Eater's mind.""Fuck off," I spat. "I have nothing in common with you."He arched one of his eyebrows."You haven't?" before I could say a word or fight back, he grabbed my arm harshly and showed me my own scar, that poor attempt of a Dark Mark, the product of my mother's brutality. "Then, what is this?""Your dear Circe's madness.""Is it?" he grabbed his wand, ironic, and pressed the tip against the scar. Immediately, I felt it burning and stinging. I hissed, swallowing the pain. "You know what this is? The memory of what we have done to you. The tracks, as well as those other scars you carry, of what betraying family does. The reminder that you will never be free from us."I stayed silent, glaring at him."Where's Potter?" he repeated."I don't know.""Where's Potter, Little Circe? Don't make it harder for you.""I'm telling you I don't know.""WHERE IS HE, YOU FILTHY MUDBLOOD?" Yaxley hit the table, making his henchmen flinch. But not me."I'm saying I don't fucking know," I drawled, articulating slowly every single word. "In what fucking language do you want to hear it?""Yaxley," one of the other men intervened, "The Dark Lord is not going to like this."The man stared at me, frowning his eyebrows and giving me a despicable look. Without any word he took his hand back, closing it in a fist that crashed into my face, hard. So hard that the other men in the room flinched. So hard that I felt how my head almost turned around and I savoured the metallic flavour of blood in my tongue.I moved my face back slowly, glaring at him and spitting the blood to the floor. When I was about to stand up to break his filthy arrogant smile, he moved his wand, fixing me to my seat."You fucking son of a bitch, so scared of me that you have to fix me to the bloody table?" I grumbled, noticing how a little thread of blood was coming down from my lips."You're lucky your mother is the Dark Lord's right hand and she asked us personally not to kill you," he spoke again, freezing me with his disgusted stare. "I'd put you through hundreds of Cruciatus until your polluted blood couldn't take it anymore and your body had collapsed with the purest and rawest of pains, fuckin' traitor.""You are all obsessed with me just because Circe promised you that I would be your greatest weapon," I scoffed in a hiss. "But keep you forgetting I never wanted to join your fucking shit, Yaxley."Suddenly, the door opened widely. Kingsley's tall figure entered the place with hidden rage in his eyes."Time's up, Yaxley," he announced, staring at the Death Eater's wand against my scar. "The interrogatories can't last more than half an hour."Before letting the man reply, Kingsley grabbed carefully my arm and made me stand up, taking me out of there."Are you okay?" he asked while guiding me out of the Department, handing me clean clothes to take off the dress and clean myself a little bit and some tissues for my lip."I'm fine," I answered, keeping my calm tone.Finally, we arrived at the main door of the building, where Mr Weasley, Liv, Pauline, George, Ginny, Fred and Remus were waiting for us, all of them wearing casual clothes.As soon as our eyes met, Fred's eyes got filled with concern. His face was almost as pale as when he found me after the attack, and he seemed both frustrated and exasperated."Lilith—" he was about to start, but I interrupted him."I'm okay, Freddie," I assured him, giving him a soft smile. "What about you lot? Did they hurt you?"They shook their heads at the same time, looking with concern at my bleeding lip and the bruise starting to form on my skin."Only asked us where Harry was," Liv replied, grabbing Pauline's trembling hand."What are we gonna do now?" Ginny asked, deadpan.Mr Weasley sighed, "They've already said we are gonna be put under surveillance.""Arthur," Remus spoke, "We can't stay here in London, and if we stay all at the Burrow it's going to become even more of a target."The man nodded, tightening his lips. "Yes, besides we need to create some sort of resistance for Harry, and we can't do it if they know where the Order is staying.""We need a new headquarters," George completed."But, where?" asked Fred.A wild idea popped off into my mind. Maybe..."I know a place," I intervened, with a cold tone.Maybe we can be safe there for a couple of days until we find a new place.All eyes focused on me."It isn't a very pleasant place and we won't be able to stay for too long," I added, "but it's the only option I see feasible right now."I swallowed, almost not believing that I was about to offer them to stay there."You lot trust me?"They nodded at the same time."Fine, Mr Weasley, if I'm not wrong you'll be returning with Ginny and Mrs Weasley to the Burrow, right?" the man nodded, "Great. The rest of you, please, go home and pick up every belonging of yours that you might need. Liv, please, grab my stuff too. I have something to do first.""Where are we going?""To the outsides of Berwick, in Northumberland," I replied to George, feeling a sour flavour in my mouth at the mention of the address."Lilith, isn't that —?" Liv intervened, surprised."The Arambella House, yes," I interrupted her. "I know it sounds fucking mad, but I remembered Severus used to put protective and secret charms all over the place to protect me from the Ministry. And my elves are there, they can help us. My mother won't be there, though, she hates that place as much as she hates me.""A'right," Remus took a deep breath. "It's risky but it's our best option right now. Everybody, back to your places to grab your luggage."Before letting him leave, I grabbed Fred's wrist."I'm going to have a last little stroll by muggle London," I announced to him, softening my tone. "Wanna come?"It sounded as if I was offering him to have a date right after being interrogated by the Death Eaters.It sounded as if I was offering him to have a date.But I genuinely needed to be alone with him, not to speak, just to feel him by my side. I needed not to think about Yaxley's words. I only needed to be pacing all over my favourite spots in London like a normal muggle pair and have with him a hot chocolate from one of my favourite cafés, before having our lives dismantled once again.A little smile appeared on his face as the expression of his eyes softened."Of course," he simply said, grabbing my hand and interlacing our fingers. "Georgie, you mind grabbing my things too? You already know what I need."George smiled at the two of us. "Sure, mate. Gotta visit Angie too and make sure she and Lee are fine and well protected.""Take care, guys," Pauline grinned at the two of us while passing her arm around Liv's waist."And be careful, please," Remus added. "We will see each other again in three hours at the entrance of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes."We nodded and once they were gone, I looked at Fred again, observing his perfect face and feeling my heart racing."Shall we go?"His smile grew a little bit, "Yes, let's go. Show me muggle London, darling."

It was early in the morning and even though we were quite sleep-deprived, Fred and I had a little stroll near the River Thames, hands interlaced and calm breathings as we walked between the immense amount of muggles. The ginger was trying to hide the astonishment in his face, especially because coming to London and going somewhere else other than Diagon Alley wasn't a common thing to do for wizards.After Fred healed the cut in my lip and the bruise with a simple tap of his wand and a little caress in it, trying to get as far from the Ministry as possible, we ended up at the other side of the city, in a cosy and warm café near Southwark Bridge that had a great view of the river and a good part of the city. Once we got inside, Fred seemed so clueless that I felt an immense fondness at his wide-open curious eyes.It was a rainy day, nothing new in here, but we were so needy of some light and fresh air that we sat in one of the free tables close to the windows. The café wasn't as crowded as the last time I came here, something I thanked deeply. Soon, a nice waitress approached us;"Can I have the hot chocolate with whipped cream on it, please?" I asked, smiling kindly at her."Sure," she replied, writing it down, "And for your boyfriend?" I opened my eyes widely, feeling my blood going fast through my veins and I immediately looked at Fred whose face expression was just as surprised as mine. He got out of his daydream and managed to gaze back at the girl, still quite clueless. "Uhmm - same as her, please," he replied in a hushed and stuttery whisper.  The girl nodded and she stopped for a second, looking at the two of us with a smile; "May I say, you two make a really good couple? 'S been donkey years since last time I saw two people matching so well together at first glance." I was about to correct her but Fred interrupted me first; "Thank you," he smiled, kind of blushing. The girl wrote it down and went back to the bar to prepare our orders. I smiled at Fred, "Why didn't you correct her?" He shrugged, "I mean, it's kinda a long story, innit? Besides, I think we can both tell ours is not a innocent and normal friendship, can't we?" "Sure, but I thought it would make you uncomfortable." "Not at all," he said, honest. "Did it make you uncomfortable? I smiled, "Nah, it's just that we've never talked about this." He took a deep breath, looking through the window; "Well, lately we never have the chance, do we? Besides, I don't want to have high expectations on being in something more than a special friendship-" "When we are in the middle of a war," I added, talking at the same as him. We looked at each other and chuckled. "Yeah, me too. I don't want to have too much-" "Hope," he completed, nodding. "It's good to be optimistic, but not unrealistic and Merlin knows what happens tomorrow. I can't and don't want to start making you promises if I don't know I will live to achieve them." "I'm glad we are on the same page," I nodded, slightly relieved. "Yeah, although I still want to delight myself about the fact that someone thought I'm a Harpie's boyfriend," Fred said with an ironic arrogant tone. "That's a bloody good title to be proud of, innit?" "You definitely should be proud of someone thinking that, even if they are a muggle," I winked at him. His smile got bigger and he started looking at the people in the other tables, curious. I smiled at Fred, "You look a bit out of your comfort zone,""Sort of, but I genuinely like it. Kinda understand now dad's fascination with," he hushed his tone. "muggles."I snickered."The chocolate you ordered," Fred continued, "it isn't like the explosive one they sell next to Honeydukes is it? Because last time Georgie and I had it, we ended up covered in sugar because we didn't drink it fast enough."Some people gave us puzzled looks and I had to tighten my lips not to burst into giggles."No, Freddie. It's normal chocolate, you'll like it."The waitress came back with our orders and put them in front of us to then leave us alone for more privacy. I gave the first sip — bloody hell, it was so good.Fred looked at his straw and still a bit hesitant and not knowing too well how to react, he finally gave it a try.Savouring it, his eyes opened even more, surprised, and he couldn't help but lick his lips and hum really softly in approval."Wow," he simply said."You like it?""Yes! Tastes bloody good," he replied, excited, going straight to keep drinking it being careful not to burn his mouth with the steamy drink. "How did you know about this place?""Hermione recommended it to me."Fred moved the straw inside his cup."Y'know, I'm really happy to have a moment like this with you after the night we had," he started, taking a long and deep breath, almost unable to look at my eyes. "I couldn't tell you before — because we were in front of the rest but, hmm, when those Death Eaters dragged me with them...I ended up in the room next to you and—"He tightened his lips, closing his eyes for a brief second."And?" I encouraged him to continue, gulping."And they forced me to watch and listen to everything they were telling you and doing to you," Fred finally confessed.I froze in my place. Fuckin' shit.I played with my straw, moving the whipping cream and feeling the steam coming from the drink slightly grazing my face."They're a bunch of bastards. You shouldn't have seen that nor heard it."Fred slightly pursed his lips, taking a deep breath."I'm sorry you had to go through that, darling. They tried to ask me where Harry was and when I told them I didn't know — Merlin, they fucking guessed you mean a lot to me because they cast a spell to the wall and forced me to watch you right there, sitting with Yaxley in front of you and — he telling you those disgusting things..."I swallowed hard again, trying to focus on the sweet flavour of the hot chocolate instead."I want you to know I would've never let Greyback nor any of them put a single finger on you," he stated, pretty firmly, serious and sure of himself. More than ever. "I don't care how many faces I would've had to break, they weren't going to touch you. I already wanted to slam Yaxley's face against the table and hex him when I saw him burning your scar and when I saw how he punched you."Oh, my dear fucking Merlin, Fred.Without knowing what words to say, I simply grabbed his hand and pulled it closer to my lips to start spreading little and soft kisses in it."We are alright, Freddie. That's all that matters."He ran his other hand through his face, looking exhausted."Bloody hell, I'm knackered," he whispered, giving another sip to his chocolate."Yeah, me too. All these hours being awake and this emotional exhaustion — we deserve a proper rest," I murmured, playing with the rings in his fingers. "Hopefully we can have it at the Arambella House."He arched one of his eyebrows, almost unnoticeable."You sure you wanna go there, Lilith?" Fred asked, not sounding too sure. "I mean, you can't even call it your home."I agreed with him, "My elves are the closest to 'home' we will find in there. I already warn you, Freddie, it's a cold and frivolous place, don't expect the cosiness of the Burrow. And I really don't want to go back there, but I need to see how the elves are and we don't have any other possible headquarters."Besides, you are the only home I need. I thought."'S okay, at least we will all be together.""Such a good team we make," I smiled at him and he winked at me, grinning. "But I bet you'll miss your home, anyway."Fred huffed, smiling and shook his head slightly and slowly."Is é mo bhaile an áit a bhfuil tú." he murmured in the most beautiful tone and voice he had ever used.I felt mesmerized by him. Fred's voice speaking Gaeilge was absolutely-fucking gorgeous."What does that mean?" I asked him, curious.His smile widened."It means you have hot chocolate on your nose," he scoffed, giving me such a mischievous smile and deep sparkly stare that I knew he was lying.But I let it be.We kept chatting for a little longer until, suddenly, Fred's smile faded."Lilith," he said, pretty muffled, kinda scaring me. "There is a problem.""What is it?""I— I don't have muggle money with me," he muttered, quite embarrassed.I snickered, "Don't worry, Freddie. I was planning to invite you anyway.""But I don't like it when you spend money on me! Traditionally, it's the man who pays for the date."Date. Date, date, date, date. This was indeed a date.I played it down, smiling again. "C'mon, you gonna tell me you're one of those old-fashioned blokes? Let me pamper you for once, Fred."Reluctantly, he finally accepted and we ended up coming back to the place where we were meant to meet with Remus and the rest, in comfortable silence, minds blank and hands interlaced once again."Thank you, Lilith," Fred muttered in a low voice right before approaching our lot."For what?""For making this day less miserable."✵ ✵ ✵"Alright, lot," I started with a hushed tone, feeling the cold flooding slowly my bones. "The forest has an anti-apparition jinx so we will have to walk into the depths of it to reach the House."They all nodded, and we started to silently drag our luggage inside of the gloomy and dense forest. I wanted to tell them that it wasn't that scary, but it actually was. It had always been."We are in the most northern point in England. The Scottish border is just a few miles away," I intervened, breaking the heavy silence. "This part of the county barely has any people so we won't have any neighbours.""That's great," Remus spoke, giving me a kind smile. "Dear, may I ask if you have any studio in there?""Yes, there are three. Two of them are Circe's, one of them is just about her works at the laboratory before — well, you know. The other one has lots of information about the Death Eaters and the First Wizarding War, I don't know if nowadays it would be useful but it's at your complete reach if you want it. There's only one room that has always remained locked, I never dared to open it."I gulped."Ares's studio," I completed. "If any of you manages to open the door, that'd be great, but as far as I know it's been locked for the past 17 years. There is also a part of the house which is completely destroyed and in ruins, but the most important part of it it's intact."We kept walking, penetrating more and more into the silent forest."I'm sorry, guys," I burst out, suddenly."Why?" Pauline asked, confused."For not having anything better to offer you. For dragging you with me to this fucking cursed place. For making you know such a dark part of my life."I heard them sigh."Lilith," George intervened, "You have nothing to apologise for, the fact that it's a place where we can stay and work without problem it's enough and I'm sure all of us thank you for it. Don't be a fool and blame yourself for things that aren't your fault.""Aha, if the blithering bitch of your mother ruined that place it's her fault, not yours." Fred completed.I heard Liv running by my side, and soon, she interlaced her hand with mine. Looking at me with those blue eyes that always managed to comfort me."We'll be okay there, you'll see."Five minutes after, we were finally able to drop our luggage on the ground for a second, staying in the middle of a huge clearing with the crows in the trees as witnesses.I took a deep breath, staring at the empty place. I remember the password. I remember it too well."Night monster," I whispered, feeling a huge knot forming on my throat as I gulped, the words tripping in my mouth.The invisible spell started to vanish, slowly and silently showing the gardens in front of the house."That password was settled by Ares himself" I explained once I saw their confused faces, staring at me. "Nor Circe or Snape cared to change it.""Why is it?" asked Fred."It's the meaning of my name," I dryly answered, "He chose it himself."The Arambella House was a sort of ruined dark Gothic manor with the outside walls and roof painted all in an aristocratic black with the silver fence protecting the gardens, giving the whole place a slightly threatening but also noble look.I gave them a sign for them to follow me. It felt weird to be touching again the same old and uncoloured grass after two years. It felt like going back to the same black hole."It was Ares the one who chose to name you 'Lilith'?" Remus intervened, quite surprised. "I have read about that name, it appears in Jewish mythology, doesn't it? Adam's first wife.""Aha, first witch and one of the first demons." I nodded. "My mother chose Medea for me. Fucking ironic since in Greek mythology, Medea was a witch who murdered her kids after her husband abandoned her."We finally arrived at the porch and I knocked at the door three times.It opened slowly and right then when I set a foot on the wood floor, three little figures appeared in front of me. Suddenly, all my sadness vanished and I kneeled to hug the three little elves welcoming us."Lilith!" Nilsy was the first one to approach me, using one of my dresses from when I was a baby. The elf threw herself into my arms to hug me tightly."You came!" Weepey burst excited, jumping around me."Oh, and you brought company! Come in, please, come in, please." Dondey let the rest enter. This was the first time someone who wasn't a relative of mine or myself set a foot inside of the house. Not even Liv had come before."Lads, these are Nilsy and Dondey," I introduced them, "And this little beauty of here is Weepey, their daughter."The three elves stared, curiously, at the rest as they, one by one, introduced themselves."We've come here to stay for a couple of days," I announced them, "Things in London are a bit tough right now. Hope you don't mind.""Of course we don't mind!" Dondey intervened, excited."This is your house, Lilith!" Nilsy added."Besides, we have missed you," said Weepey, "Weepey's learning to read. Has Weepey told you, Lilith?"I smiled, "No, you haven't. But I'm so happy to know."We entered the house and ended up putting down our luggage in the main living room. Faint shivers ran through my spine remembering the nightmare I had before my mother's attack. The inside of the Arambella House was slightly cosier than the outside. Except for the ripped portraits and the heavy ambience, the rooms had been decorated with quite a good taste and it had this sort of ancient elegance similar to the one in Grimmauld.I couldn't help but look at the photo over the fireplace; Ares's portrait. The space in his shirt where his heart would have been was entirely torn and only his face could be seen. He had that aristocratic, serious and piercing stare of green eyes and arched eyebrows, his lips were tightly pressed and his jawline slightly clenched."Are you the baby in this picture?" Fred asked calling my attention, gazing at one of the pictures on the shelves, the corners of his lips curled into a little smile. I approached him."Yes," I finally said, observing the picture; I was like 2 years old. A little baby with big green innocent eyes and a mane of messy curls, with one of Circe's potions diary in my hands and the dummy hanging from a necklace around my little neck. "It's from before — well, everything.""You were beautiful," he whispered, sparkles swimming in the brown of his eyes. "I looked like a fucking chubby carrot when I was a baby."I couldn't help but giggle, pressing my forehead against his shoulder."Lilith, this place is absolutely beautiful," Pauline said, quite mesmerized. Running her eyes everywhere."To be honest, mate, I expected it to be way darker and scary," Liv agreed."Oh, and you haven't seen the fanciest part of the house yet. Nils, are any of the rooms from the second floor available for us?" I asked the little elf and she quickly nodded. "I bet my friends would love them.""Yes, all of them! Nilsy has kept them clean and ready to be used," she said, pretty proud of herself. "If you follow Nilsy, Nilsy can show you your rooms.""Dondey can make some food if you want, Lilith!" the old elf talked, grabbing his daughter's tiny hand."If you have enough of it, then sure, we would love it."Fred and I ended up alone in the living room, in front of Ares's portrait. The pattering sound of the rain outside and the crackling fire as only melodies. Staring at the flames, I felt Fred's hands delicately surrounding my waist and his chin resting on my shoulder."It pains me to see you this sad, Lilith," he murmured in a soft tone.I sighed, caressing his hands over my belly. "I can't help it. There are too many memories in this place.""Let's make new ones, then.""Come again?""Yes, let's make new ones. You're not alone anymore, darling. You're not anymore that unprotected baby," he whispered, pointing with his head another picture in front of us that showed me when I was six; the picture was taken by Severus to be sent to my doctor so he could keep track of my growth. Nilsy begged him not to throw it away and she ended up framing it. I observed my tiny little self; I still had that same mane full of uncontrolled curls and waves but the sadness was pretty much alive in my eyes, and there wasn't any more innocence in them, just pain and isolation. "You are not anymore that little girl with sad eyes. You're a new Lilith who has the chance to create new stories with her friends in her childhood house. Don't let the figure of the bastard you had as a father crash you. Don't let the bitch of your mother keep making you carry with her crimes. You're not alone. You have me."I turned around to face Fred and he gave me another dim smile, caressing my cheek and softly wiping off the little tear coming down my eye."You're not a night monster as this son of a bitch called you," he continued pointing with his head at the portrait of Ares behind me, but still keeping his soft tone. "You're not a demon either. You are an angel, darling. A fucking angel with too much fucking pain inside of her."I bit my lip to fight back the tears grouping in my eyes and rubbed softly my nose against his."Oh, Merlin, Freddie," I managed to stutter with a trembly voice and a huge knot forming in my throat.Fred smiled and shortened the distance between us, fusing our lips in a slow, burning and sweet kiss as he glued me even more to his body.Setting my poor heart on fire.

After having dinner all together and staying for a little while in front of the fireplace, Remus finally stood up from the armchair;"Alright, kids, I have to return to Burrow. Forgot to ask Arthur for the Order's reports. Besides, I wanna give a little visit to Tonks, she's staying at her parents' place."We nodded, enjoying our last cup of tea before going to sleep."Tomorrow morning we can start trying to investigate in Circe's studio, if you don't mind, Lilith," he said, coming straight to hug me."It's all yours," I immediately said, hugging him back. "Take care, please."Remus left us in the warm living room, hearing the wind whistling, caressing the leaves from the trees against the big window. The fire kept crackling as Dondey interrupted the silence, coming from the kitchen;"Lilith, tomorrow Dondey will open the door of Master Ares's studio, if you want, of course."I took a deep breath. I was still quite hesitant about reopening such a wound as Ares entailed to me, but at the same time, some part in the depth of my mind eagerly wanted to know what was behind that door."Sure," I smiled, "Besides, I bet that the twins and the girls will need more space.""Great idea it is," said Fred, looking kindly at the elf, "Even if we're out of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, the Order and other clients still need our products. We will need a place to work."A couple of minutes later, we finally decided to leave to our bedrooms, but as I walked through the dark and silent corridor that guided me to the room that used to be mine when I was little, I realised something.I can't go back to that room.

Create new memories, Lilith.Still in absolute and complete silence, feeling the cold floor under my bare feet, I walked in the other direction of the corridor with the immobile eyes of my ancestors' portraits fixed on me. I stood in front of one of the many unused dorms in the house, and after taking a couple of deep breaths and meditating about if it was the best idea or not; I finally knocked."Come in!"I opened the door, finding Fred right about to lay on the bed, shirtless and in sweatpants, ready to go to sleep."Yes?" he asked, curiously, when he saw me there almost unable to speak."Can I-" I gulped, "Can I sleep with you?"A soft and tender smile covered his face."Come 'ere, darling," Fred patted the bed, inviting me to join him.✵ ✵ ✵Remus arrived again the next day when the sun was barely up in the sky. Even though we were still in summer, the cold inside the Arambella House and this enchanted place of the country, made it feel as if we were in midwinter.Lupin was incredibly pale when he arrived, crumpling up a piece of paper in his hands that I recognised as The Prophet. Without saying any word, he sat at the table, put the paper on it to show it to me and stayed there with his haunting gaze.

TONKS FAMILY INTERROGATED BY THE MINISTRY

After the disappearance of the Undesirable nº1, also known as Harry Potter, after Albus Dumbledore's death, the Ministry has proclaimed him as the principal suspect of the Headmaster's murder. To enquire into this cause more profoundly, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has decided to officially interrogate some of the participants of Potter's inner circle. The Tonks family, formed by the blood traitor Andromeda Tonks, neé Black, the mudblood Ted Tonks and their daughter married to a Half-breed - who we do not consider worthy to be mentioned -, were some of the first lucky ones to experience the new interrogation method created by the great and unique Dolores Umbri...I had to stop reading."What the fuck is this load of bullshit? Undesirable nº1? And what fucking method did that pink bitch used on them?""She tortured them," Remus replied faintly. "She used the Cruciatus curse on Andromeda and Ted. Dora wasn't there, apparently, she had an appointment with the doctor to check her pregnancy but by the time I arrived at their home, they were laying on the ground after fainting because of the pain."Oh, fucking Merlin."I don't understand," I tutted, "The Prophet has always been quite controversial but the vocabulary they use - it sounds as if they were...""As if they were part of the Death Eaters, I know," Remus completed for me. "They actually are, and right now they haven't even waited a couple of days to keep everyone related to Harry under complete vigilance. I'll have to talk to Harry.""Do you know where he is?" I asked, surprised."I have a little suspicion. The safest place for him at the moment might be Grimmauld and knowing that he's with Ron and Hermione - she's smart enough to join the dots. However, I'm gonna try to stay a little vigilant once I'm in London again. Don't wanna enter the house and find out it has been destroyed by the Death Eaters."After showing the newspaper to the rest, we all decided it was time to start working on creating resistance for Harry and keep the Order in its course. Thanks to Nilsy and Weepey, we managed to get inside one of Circe's studios, where she kept track of everything related to the Death Eater cause right before she was caught. Surprisingly, after she was imprisoned, no one even tried to inspect the House. They probably thought it wouldn't be necessary.Foolish idiots.The studio was quite messy, full of papers, folders and diaries here and there and also some pictures and press clippings."Lilith, look," George said, grabbing one of the file folders of the shelves, reading it carefully "This looks like a register of all of the Death Eaters who got the mark.""This contains all the victims during the First Wizarding World," Pauline added, with quite a disappointed and devastated tone, looking at one of the diaries."Mate, your mother was keeping track of all the people who joined the Death Eaters with and without the Imperio curse," Liv murmured in a hushed tone, completely surprise while reading another notebook. "This can be used as proof against them in a trial."I approached her and read the messy notes, over her shoulder, analysing my mother's sharp and furious handwriting:Fabian and Gideon Prewett. Blood traitors. Drowned and hung by Dolohov, Rockwood and his pack under 

 orders. (1981) Imperio Curse used.Walden MacNair. Avery. Joined the cause (1980) NO CURSE USED.Igor Karkaroff. Drumstrang Headmaster. Provided the Minister with some of our names. (1981) 

FUCKING TRAITOR.

THE DARK LORD HAS FALLEN. (OCTOBER 1981) 

HARRY POTTER (?)

Longbottom family. Members of the Order of the Phoenix. Tortured by Bella, Rodolphus and Barty. Cruciatus curse used. (1981)

I'M ABOUT TO BE IMPRISONED. CROUCH OFFERS ME TO ESCAPE WITH HIM TO BULGARIA. SOME OF GRINDELWALD FOLLOWERS STILL ALIVE. (NOVEMBER 1981)

I CAN'T LEAVE ENGLAND WITHOUT FINDING 

ARES.

I gasped as soon as I read those names. She literally kept track of every single little detail. Ares's name was almost in every single one of the pages, not only in that notebook but in every single one of the folders and diaries as well.She had been, and still was, obsessed.The letters of his name were messily and furiously traced with black ink, it seemed so full of rage and anger that I was genuinely surprised the paper wasn't torn."Make sure you keep all of this information. I'm completely sure it's going to be useful," I advised, trying to find more evidence and more names that nowadays could cause trouble to us."Darling," Fred called me, quite pale while he was holding one of my mother's diaries in his hands. "Lilith, you need to see this."I scowled, confused when I saw him gulping as he showed me one of the pages. I got completely perplexed;

15th June. 1978

Diary,

Ares spends a lot of time with our little Lili. He hasn't hugged her yet nor kissed her nor spoken a word to her - at least not in my presence. Merlin knows what he tells her once I'm at the laboratory. Hope he keeps progressing on loving our beautiful baby girl as much as I love him and he loves me.

Circe Arambella.I stared at the letter completely confused. I knew that my mother kept some of her diaries from before being imprisoned but I could have sworn that she had burnt everything that had to do with Ares. I moved to the other written page, trying to reunite all the information possible and to join the fucking dotes rambling crazy in my mind;

11th November. 1978

Diary,

Lili is already one year old. She has said her first word; mamma. I'm incredibly proud of her. Ares, however, seems to be even more distant from her, he barely addresses her and he spends more time working on his studio and observing Lili from the distance than actually taking care of her. Merlin thank the elves for taking care of my baby while I'm out.

Circe Arambella.I kept passing a couple of pages till I got to one, in particular, that was almost burnt and with the words slightly crossed out.

15th September. 1979.

Diary,

Ares has confessed to me something about his ancestry. About his blood. He has been using Lili all this entire time. He has been lying to me about...The next letters were crossed out so I had to jump to the next line;I still love him. I can't stop loving him. 

No matter what happens.

Circe Arambella.The last entry drove cold shivers all over my spine and I almost dropped the diary to the floor. It was from the day he left.

1st November 1979

He has left us. He has left 

Fucking son of a bloody bitch. I will find him.

I will fucking find him and I will fucking burn him alive. He's gonna pay for this. My Lili will make him pay for this.

I feel disgusted at myself because 

I still fucking love him.

Circe 

Snape.

"What the fucking hell..?" I whispered, completely bewildered, feeling my throat drying and my eyes as widely open I thought they would fall off my face. "He was using me? For what?"What in Merlin's fucking sake did this mean? Ares using me? A secret about his blood? Oh, Circe, you've got a lot of things to explain, you bitch.Fred clicked his tongue and took the diary from my hands before I could complain."Love, don't brood about it too much. Whatever he did is in the past now and he doesn't deserve a single thought of yours.""But-""Lilith," Liv called me, making straight eye contact with me. "If you want to keep enquiring into it that's up to you, but Fred's right. Don't let the bastard of your father have any more control over your emotions.""My father is Remus Lupin. Ares was just the sperm donor."Pauline smiled at me; "All the more reason then. Don't chew on it too much, chérie. Focus on having your revenge over the bitch of your mum.""This only proves to me what my mother has always told me, she wanted me to be her weapon. She used me but she never told me he used me as well," I mumbled, trying to control the hurricane happening in my mind."He was a fucking son of a bitch," George said, still looking at one of the folders. "We already knew that."Suddenly, Remus and the elves appeared on the door, quite out of breath and with their eyes opened widely."Lilith-" Remus started, quite out of breath."Dondey, Nilsy, Weepy and Mr Remus have found something at Ares's studio," Dondey added."Nilsy wanted to have a look inside before you so Nilsy could check there wasn't any danger inside for you," Nilsy continued with watery eyes."Weepey found something, Lilith! Weepey found something really bad about Ares!" Weepey burst into tears."Dear, I don't know how to sugar-coat this so I will say directly," Lupin gulped, scaring me even more and making all of us pay full attention to him. "Ares was trying to steal your magic."WHAT?!

Oh, motherfucking Merlin bitch, you've got to be taking the piss at this point.I was so in shock that I almost fainted and Fred and George had to put my arms over their shoulders to carry me to the kitchen and make take a seat at the table, drinking water while Liv tried to console Weepey's uncontrollable tears."What do you mean he tried to steal my magic, Remus?" I asked pretty out of breath, while Fred observed me carefully, sitting in front of me. He didn't listen to Lupin's words, he was just staring at me, making sure I didn't break into pieces at any moment.Remus sighed."When I entered the studio, the first thing that called my attention was the fact that a muggle had so many books about magic and curses. I sat on his desk and found some of his diaries with a huge map that included the entire Arambella bloodline," Remus made a little pause, "He wasn't a muggle, dear. He was a squib."Merlin's right ball, what?"That can't be possible," I shook my head, "My mother always referred to him as a muggle. Besides, if he was a squib then that means that my grandparents had to be wizards and I know for a fact that they weren't.""You are right, your grandparents weren't wizards but the magic is inside the Arambella bloodline because hundreds of years ago, they were wizards," Remus replied, showing me one of Ares diaries. "Your father explains here that one of his ancestors carried a bloodline curse saying that -""No man under the Arambella surname could be magical." Dondey, Nilsy and Weepey completed. "And you are the first Arambella girl in centuries.""He was monitoring and writing a full investigation about how to transfer magic from one body to another by blood magic, which is incredibly forbidden. Even You-know-who hesitates using blood magic. When he noticed that he wouldn't be able to do it by himself and probably Circe didn't want to help him, he simply left you.""You knew it?!" I asked the elves, absolutely disappointed.Weepey started crying. "We didn't know what he was trying to do with you! We couldn't read his diaries because Weepey didn't know how to read and Mistress Circe had taught Ares to soak the pages in poison for elves!""But Ares had the habit of thinking aloud and that sentence was something that he repeated constantly," Dondey completed. "Dondey is very curious, you already know, Dondey couldn't help but listen to it.""But when Mistress Circe found out that Dondey knew, she cursed Dondey and Nilsy to forget about the bloodline curse until you had discovered it by yourself," Nilsy stuttered, making a little pout. "Nilsy is really sorry, Lilith. Nilsy never wanted Lilith to suffer."I took a deep breath. I wasn't mad at them. They were the last ones to have any kind of fault in this."So, basically, my life has been an entire lie thanks to my parents. My mother has been obsessed with him for the past 17 years, which I already knew but this is only confirmation. And my own father tried to steal my magic to transfer it to himself and when he discovered he couldn't do it, he simply left," I counted with my fingers, completely deadpan and with my blood feeling like ice in my veins. "Great, fucking fantastic."Remus looked at me with a bit of pity; "The good thing is that by being born as a girl and being the only Arambella known, the last name will disappear with you, meaning that you might have broken the curse without even knowing it and if you ever have kids who happen to be boys, they have the chance to be magical because they won't be under the Arambella surname."Fred interlaced his hands with mine while George caressed my back and Liv and Lin were making sure I was breathing correctly."Listen to me, Lilith," Fred spoke in a whisper, "I don't care what that bloody bastard tried to do, I don't care what a fucking bitch your mother was and still is. I only care about your well-being and right now you need to breathe deeply and calm down, okay? I know this is a huge shock for you but you need to calm down, angel. Don't let them hurt you more than they already have.""Is it possible that this doesn't even make me sad anymore?" I shook my head, snorting, ironic. "It only disappoints me - and catches me by surprise, obvs - but mainly, it's just more disappointment.""That's normal, mate," George added. "They don't deserve a single feeling from you.""The only thing they deserve is a fucking bloody curse hitting them," Liv mumbled with a deadpan face.Fucking yes, they do.✵ ✵ ✵During the next week that we spent at the Arambella House, I tried not to think about the revelation I had. Ares didn't deserve a single one of my thoughts. Instead, thanks to Fred's cuddles and attention and the unity with my friends, we focused my attention somewhere else and we decided that The Prophet couldn't keep lying to the Wizarding World.If they kept spreading those lies, we would get to a point where people outside the Order wouldn't know who are the good ones and who are not.That's how Potterwatch was born.We didn't have anything planned yet nor any material to start working with, but we knew we wanted to give the real and raw information about what was happening out there, especially every movement the Death Eaters were doing and the Prophet was trying to hide. Almost everyone knew by now that the newspaper was as corrupt as the Ministry, but for the people who didn't, they absolutely needed a slap back into reality and that would be us.We had compiled lots of information, thanks to the files Circe's studio, about the Death Eaters, their families and the stuff they did in the past that no one knew about.I would lie if I say that the truth about Ares wasn't still something that rambled every once in a while on my mind; I kept trying to relive any kind of memory of him studying me, of him mentioning magic, of him trying to hurt me - but it was useless, my only memory was the day he left.I was sat in the kitchen, drinking my cup of tea while I heard the twins, Liv and Pauline giggling in the living room at some artefact the twins had created, when I saw it; peacefully set over the tree branch, staring at us.A crow. But not a normal crow; a Patronus.Mother.I immediately stood up and ran to the living room."Everyone, start packing your things we need to leave this place right now!" I announced them with my voice out of breath and coming out as a hiss. "She's been observing us. She'll come at any moment."They all stared quite puzzled at me; "Who?""Circe. Her bloody Patronus is out there, observing us from a tree branch. She knows we are here."After a joint gasp, they immediately started to move, picking their wands to put back into the luggage everything they might need and every piece of information we had found."Lilith!" Nilsy came running at me, whispering. "Nilsy has seen a crow out there. A Patronus crow. Mistress Circe is coming, you need to -""I know, Nils, I know," I interrupted her, "We are leaving right now, I don't know where but we are leaving."Dondey sighed quite loud; "There is one last secret Lilith doesn't know about Master Ares.""A secret not even Mistress Circe nor Master Severus knows," Weepey added, nodding with puppy eyes."What is it?" I asked, quite perplexed. Merlin, more surprises?"There is a hut in the middle of Scotland that belongs to the Arambella family. Ares confessed it to Dondey one night he was drunk. We always thought he had escaped there when he left but when Mistress Circe was sent to Azkaban, Dondey went to the hut and there wasn't anyone." Dondey explained."Lilith and her friends can go there," Nilsy encouraged, catching my hands in between her tiny ones. "Mistress Circe doesn't know about the existence of that hut. Ares ordered us to never say a word about it and to forbid Circe to know about the hut - and Lilith knows what a Master's order means to an unfreed elf."I observed my friends and their tired faces. I have to get them out of here. They don't deserve this."Alright, you three are coming with us. Take us to the hut please," I asked them."Lads!" Remus burst, entering the house almost running. "WE HAVE TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW! CIRCE-""We know," we all said at the same time."We are leaving to another hidden place that not even Circe knows about."I saw Weepey shaking her head, "Weepy and Dondey can't accompany Lilith. Nilsy can go and appear you there but we can't leave with you. Weepy will be safe here, Mistress Circe won't hurt us and Weepey and Dondey can distract her from following you."I wanted to protest but a strong sound, as if something - or someone - had landed outside the house, in the forest, interrupted me."Shit, we need to go," I murmured, grabbing Fred and Liv's hands, who were by my side, as George, Remus and Pauline also held on to us, ready to disappear with Nilsy.Elves' magic wasn't as advanced as human's magic so by the time we appeared in another forest - way less gloomy and dark than the one in England - Liv and I felt quite dizzy while the rest stumbled in their feet, trying to stand up.I was kneeled on the fresh grass, trying to catch air, when I felt Fred's hands around my waist, softly pulling me up. While the rest were trying to pick up all the luggage, he examined my face, making sure I was fine."Are you okay?" he murmured in a faint whisper.I nodded. "You?""Completely fine," he replied with a nervous smile on his face. "Fuck, I thought she would catch us. Thank Merlin Nilsy made us disappear quickly enough."I sighed, "Yeah, a good thing. I don't think I can take seeing her, y'know?. Not right now, at least. Need to get ready before finishing her off. ""I wouldn't have let her hurt you again, though," he immediately said, with his soft eyes focused on me. He rubbed his nose against mine and put his hands on my cheeks. "Not again. Not when I would be right there witnessing everything. She would have to pass over me because I'm not letting her snatch you from me any time soon."I'm not letting her snatch you from me any time soon.

Ares's hut was a way cosier place than I expected. Almost all made of wood with little rooms, the kitchen and the living room together, a tiny porch and enough space for all of us. I was genuinely surprised since it had anything we might have needed and it was incredibly cleaned and well preserved.When we were trying to divide the rooms, Fred immediately offered me to sleep with him and, obviously, I agreed — sleeping with him was becoming a habit that erased any sort of pain inside of me."You don't mind, Georgie, do you?" I asked the other twin who was staring at us with an accomplice look.He immediately huffed, shrugging."Obvs no, mate. I have the chance to have a rest from this daft prick I have as a twin," he said, slightly punching Fred's arm.A couple of days after being finally accommodated, we realised that we were actually incredibly safe and hidden from the Death Eaters or the Snatchers — Greyback's squad. The forest that hid the hut was just a few miles away from a little muggle village where we managed to get our food and other things we needed. To be even more protected, just in case, we put every kind of protective spell we could think of and made each of us our own secret keepers. If there were people who I trusted with my own life, those were my friends.Remus ended up going every once in a while back to England, where he made sure to check everyone was well-protected and bearing with the situation as okay as they could. He even got to see Harry, Ron and Hermione who —  as he had said — were staying at Grimmauld, planning their next move carefully. But what genuinely surprised me was the embarrassed, angry and pale face he returned back with after going to see them for the first time.I tried to ask him what had happened but he refused to tell me, instead, he grabbed his wand announcing that he needed to see Tonks and that we would be back the next day after with the materials needed to start the Potterwatch project.We also kept communicating with the Weasley family as much as we could and Ginny, our principal spy inside the school, managed to communicate to us how my uncle was the new headmaster of Hogwarts and the Carrow siblings, two fucking bastards who obviously were Death Eaters as well, were the new teachers. They were treating the school as a prison and the only vestiges of the previous bravery and freedom were the resistance of some students such as Neville — who was making me incredibly proud —, Seamus Finnigan and surprisingly, a huge group from my house who were using their privilege as purebloods and Slytherins to fuck up the new teachers as much as they could.In the Ministry, however, corruption was deeply rooted in its system. All of us were declared as enemies of the Wizarding World, according to The Prophet. Declared Undesirables and traitors to our own kind. All of us.Fucking bastards.Things were starting to be so tough in London, that during the start of our second week at the hut, Remus arrived with Lee and Angelina — much to George's happiness — to keep them safe as well, since they were being threatened."Are you guys okay?" I asked them once they entered the place, slightly freezing because of the fresh September air."Yeah, don't worry. We managed to avoid the Snatchers," Angie said, quite relieved to see George and running to hug him."Mate, this a good proper place, can't wait to start that Potterwatch project you lot have in mind," continued Lee, as smiley and positive as usual."I'm glad you've stayed here. The Ministry has issued an arrest warrant for us with the excuse of declaring about Albus's death, but it's only a trap, they want to put the bullseye on us and erase from the map as many sympathisers of Harry as possible," Remus informed us the morning he arrived with the mics and the artefacts needed to create the radio station.George had got to the conclusion that we couldn't inform about the actual news using any newspaper, that the best option was to tap the radio stations and create a new one that only certain people could have access to thanks to a password that we would be changing every once in a while.Remus spread a couple of press clippings with our names;

THE BÉLIER FAMILY; ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE FRENCH MUDBLOODS

LOVEGOODS; HAS THEIR MADNESS MADE THEM TURN TO THE WRONG SIDE?

Our reporter, Rita Skeeter, talks with the owner of the Quibbler, Xenophillus Lovegood himself, about his daughter, Olivia Lovegood, who remains under an arrest warrant...

THE WEASLEYS; BLOOD TRAITORS KICKED OUT OF THE SACRED TWENTY-EIGHT

We already know about the sort of boy Undesirable nº2, also known as Ronald Weasley, is, but what do we know about his family? Certainly, they are purebloods, coming straight from the Prewett bloodline with hints of Black ancestry in their family tree. (...) But, what do we have to say about those particular twins? The owners of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes are known for being quite problematic and huge sympathisers of Undesirable nº1. They have earned quite a good fortune thanks to their business which now remains shut at Diagon Alley — even though this newspaper suspects that they might be still fulfilling their client's orders. They have been required to declare about Dumbledore's death but they haven't assisted to their appointment. What are they hiding?

IS SEVERUS SNAPE'S NIECE A TRAITOR TO HER OWN KIND?!

As you may already know, Lilith Arambella — or as she likes to be called; Lilith Lupin is the daughter of the known Potions investigator, Circe Snape and the niece of the current Headmaster of Hogwarts, Severus Snape. However, even though this lady has the privilege to be part of one of the most accommodated families in the Wizarding World, she seems to reject the nature in her blood and embrace that obtuse role of half-blood avenger being declared as one of the Undesirables by the member of the Minister, Corban Yaxley."Are my parents in danger?" Pauline asked, alarmed.Remus quickly shook his head, trying to calm her; "No, no, dear. As long as they stay in France, they will be fine. Lor— fuck, I mean, He might have power in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but not as much in the rest of Europe as he thinks he has.""Could you communicate with dad and Luna?" Liv intervened, speaking with a soft worried tone. "They haven't replied to my last letter. I sent it to them a week ago.""Yes, dear. I talked with your dad, he said Luna was chasing some...Pymplis?" Remus replied, trying to remember the name of the Lovegood creature. My best friend broke her worried expression into a little calmer smile;"Fishing Plympis.""Yes! That! He's alright, Oli. Just tired of all this situation, like all of us. And he hasn't replied to you because he's scared of risking you, Xenophillus might be quite of an odd man but he loves you and Luna more than anything else in this world."Liv sighed, somewhat relieved."This only proves something we already knew, Remus," George started, preparing the microphones and things we might need. "We need to give the people the real information. Besides, if Harry, my brother and Granger are isolated at Grimmauld, what better way for them to know what's happening outside?""We need a host," Pauline immediately intervened, "And it has to be someone not under so much vigilance. Maybe me, Livie, Lee or Angelina. You four are way too deep into the Potter cause."A bit hesitant, we all agreed and Lee immediately offered to be the host as the great and brave journalist he was."And we also need code names," Liv immediately said. "But really tricky and difficult to guess ones.""We can say a little white lie to keep our location protected," I piped up, "We can say we are switching locations every time we make a broadcast.""That's a great idea.""Kingsley might also participate from his hidden refuge. After the interrogatory when they interrupted the wedding, he was also declared an Undesirable.""I can focus on creating another station connected to France just in case the United Kingdom ends up being isolated!" Pauline burst suddenly, having such a great idea."I speak French, I can help you!" Angelina said, quite excited, making Lin nod effusively.We started to decide which code names we would have and what words we could utilize to use as passwords;"What about names related to Harry and the Order? You know; Sirius, Weasley, Mad-Eye...that sort of things," Fred suggested, making us immediately agree about using them as passwords."I can call myself 'Hecate', she's the Goddess of Witchcraft in Greek Mythology and Medea was a witch," I propose when we started a brainstorm for the code names."I like it!" Angie smiled."My name is associated with peace, I can call myself 'dove'!" Liv piped up, suddenly, writing it down."I'll be River," Lee said, quite proud of himself. "Remus, what about you?""You lot can choose mine if you want," the man smiled."Great! What do you think about 'Romulus' then?"Lupin agreed."I wanna be Dumbo!" George burst, giggling.Liv scowled a bit confused, not understanding the muggle reference and watching me snickering."Why so?""It's obvs, Liv! Because of my big long ears, duh!" he ironised, pointing at his missing ear covered still with a bandage."Fred, what if you call yourself 'Rodent'?""Nah, I like better 'Rapier'.""Uh," Lee nodded, quite deadpan. "I'm gonna still call you Rodent.""Oi! Why?" Fred scowled, trying to hold back his laugh."Because the chance to choose your code name is sold out," Jordan replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world."But you let George choose!""Georgie is Georgie, you are you," Lee shrugged, smiling quite mischievously.Two days later, after Lee and Angie had accommodated — Angelina in George's room and Lee in the room left that was available — since Remus had to go back to London to bring us the new print run of the Prophet, we asked him to communicate to our closest people the news about Potterwatch and the first password; McKinnon. In honour of Remus's friend, Marlene, one of the first victims and members of the Order.Lee, Liv, George, Fred, Remus and I sat together on the floor with the mics and the wireless radio, making sure Kingsley could speak also from his hidden refuge."Ready, lads?" Jordan smiled at all of us, preparing everything.We nodded, excited."Alright, here we go," he started, taking a deep breath. "Morning, Listeners! River on the line accompanied by some of the most Undesirables for the Ministry," he scoffed, still smiling. "This is Potterwatch."✵ ✵ ✵After today's session — which went incredibly well — we decided to stipulate certain contents; an introductory part led by Lee, a minute of silence for all the deaths that were happening at the moment and that not the Prophet nor the Wizarding Wireless Network wanted to announce, updates on how the new Wizarding Laws would affect the Muggle world, explained by Kingsley, 'Pals of Potter' explaining what was happening to some of Harry's supporters, led by Remus and George. News about You-Know-Who, directed by Fred and me, and a final recommendation of mental health and another healing spells told by Liv, who thought it would be a great idea during so overwhelming times.Fred and I returned back to our dorm between giggles after the jokes he did during the first broadcast. He hugged my waist after locking the door and casting a silencing spell so we could burst into laughter freely, and laid on the bed, dragging me with him and making me fall over his chest."That went pretty good, didn't it?" Fred whispered, caressing my hair as I rested my head over his chest and he opened his legs to give me more space."Really good," I nodded, humming, "Those jokes of yours are gonna make the bloody broadcasts more bearable."He chuckled, "Well, it's a way to cope with the fact that we are in the middle of a Wizarding War. Humour sometimes is the best weapon against fear and believe me, darling, I'm a bit scared of You-Know-Who.""To be fair, who isn't?" I said, honestly, raising my face to look at him and pressing my chin against my crossed hands over his chest. "I might hate him with all my heart but I'm genuinely scared and surprised by the power he has. He was able not only to put at his feet the most pureblood obsessed families in the Wizarding World while he's actually a Half-blood but also, they call him Lord!"Fred hummed in approval, looking at me straight in the eye and moving a curl from my face."You know? His only persona used to be my Boggart," he confessed in a hushed murmur, while still caressing my cheek and playing with my curl."It isn't anymore?"He shook his head slowly."What is it now? If you don't mind me asking, of course.""It's still related to him," he started after a second of meditating, "but now it's him hurting my loved ones."My heart stopped in my chest, burning my blood."Really?""Aha, last time I checked, it was him hurting all of you." All of you. You. I am included. Fucking Merlin's balls. "My mum, my dad, my brothers and Ginny...He separating George to torture him alone because He knows Georgie is basically my other half. He hurting Liv, Angie, Lin and Lee," he took a deep breath and I noticed how he gulped as his look went to my lips and then back to my eyes. "And you, He hurting you and me not being able to help you."I swallowed hard, feeling my throat getting dry."He's not gonna hurt me, Freddie. I'm not gonna let him, and I'm not gonna let him put a single finger of his or his filthy henchmen on you either." I confessed, sounding more serious but keeping my soft tone. The little sparkles in Fred's eyes widened. "You can be sure of that.""I don't want you to risk yourself because of me, Lilith," he whispered. "If something happens to you because of me...I—I don't think I could take it. Not only I would never forgive myself for it but I genuinely think it would completely destroy me. You've crawled your way up too much into me to let you leave me this bloody soon."I observed and listened to him completely mesmerized and puzzled as my heart pounded so heart into my chest I thought it would explode. He smiled to try to play down the heavy ambience over us."I will not let you put yourself in danger because of me either, Fred." I murmured back, "We both know I'm a bigger target for those scumbags and we both know what kind of daredevil you usually are. As much as I would be able to cum in my trousers by watching you breaking Death Eaters' faces," I smiled at him, making him giggle. "I don't want to risk you. You are too worthy for me to let you risk you."I can't live without you. My eyes begged silently to him."I guess we will be trying to protect each other all the time and arguing, as usual, once we are in that final battle," he snickered, to then trap my lower lip in between his teeth."What a novelty," I rolled my eyes, smiling.I fused our lips together in a slow and soft kiss that slowly started to heat up and become more passionate, intense and messy as I moved my hips to straddle his. Wanting to carve in me every single detail of him.Fred let out a soft moan against my lips as I started to grind against him, slowly and patiently, marking the movements of my hips, feeling him getting harder under me."I miss you so much, Freddie," I pouted, looking at him straight in the eye and still moving against his growing erection. Fred slightly tilted his head back, closing his eyes and giving me a tempting heavenly view."Then fuck me, darling," he whispered. "Fuck me and show me how much you miss me."Say less, love.

I moved slowly my hips over his, letting him notice the warmth growing in between my legs as his erection grew against my body. I bit his lower lip in the middle of our messy, slow, breathtaking kiss and Fred groaned softly."I need you, Lilith," he whispered, with his pupils growing in his eyes, letting the black in them flood the brown, grinding against me. "I need you so fucking much.""You have me, Freddie," I muttered, lips grazing lips, bodies eager to have each other, hearts pounding hard together, "You always have me."I wanted him to understand the hint I just dropped, I wanted him to catch my face in his hands, tell me how much he loved me and slam his lips against mine, promising me he would love me for the rest of his life.Instead, Fred's surprised face broke into a wild smirk, grabbing my neck and crashing his lips into mine as I felt his hands sneaking below my shirt to caress my back and silently invite me to take off my clothes. I lifted my body and without separating from him, doing circles with my hips as I felt Fred panting and getting even harder, I took off my shirt under his hungry eyes, and then stood up from bed to pull down my pyjama trousers and my knickers at once. Fred's stare covered me from up to down and he immediately took off his shirt and threw away his trousers and his boxers, letting me appreciate his nudity and the hardness in his dick. I came back to the bed and went back to straddle him, dimly grazing against him.Fred lifted himself, surrounding my waist with his strong arms and trapping one of my nipples in his mouth, letting his warm tongue play with the silver of my piercings. He tried to press me so his dick could be in contact with my growing wetness but I snickered, putting a bit of resistance."Fuck, Lilith," he smiled, against the skin of my neck where he started to spread intense and claiming lovebites. "Don't punish me like this. I need you to fuck me. I need you to fuck me so badly."Feeling the tingles between my legs aching because of how much I wanted him, I pulled his ginger hair with one hand making him moan when I used my other hand to put pressure on his neck and make him lay down.He looked at me with those shiny brown eyes making me want to melt right there, and without making any of us wait anymore, I lowered my hips, grinding my pussy against his now throbbing dick. Fred grabbed my hips, digging his fingers into them and tilting his head back as his whole body trembled and his eyes closed."Lilith, please—" he slightly whimpered in a soft whisper. I put my hands over his chest and started marking the rhythm as his tip got filled with pre-cum."What is it, my love?" I teased him, in a faint murmur, feeling my voice slightly deeper. Fred's eyes widened when he heard the pet name I used with him and I noticed how he gasped and gulped."Use me," he muttered, making a little pout that I found disassembling in the most beautiful way possible. The grip of his hands on my hips became tighter. "Use me to make you cum, please."Fucking hell, Frederick.I bit my lower lip, observing his god-like body and tracing with my fingertips his v line as I kept the slow rhythm of my hips."Are you asking me to dominate you, daddy?"I scoffed in a drawled hiss.Fred chuckled, caressing my thighs with his eyes slightly closed and his dick pulsating in between my legs."Maybe — oh, fuck — maybe I want my perfect girl to dominate me and to show me how badly I am hers," he whispered in a laboured breath.Merlin, he's gonna kill me.I stopped the movement of hips, hearing him complaining. "Fine. On your knees, Freddie." He immediately obeyed, quite desperate, separating a little bit his legs and letting me appreciate his slightly sweaty chest, his eyes shining with pure desire, his laboured breathing and his dick throbbing, begging for my attention.How fucking pretty is that, huh?I approached him and after savouring his lips one last time, feeling his fingers squeezing my waist, I moved his arms so his hands could rest over the bed, exposing him even more. I straddled his hips again but this time with my back facing him. My knees positioned at each side of his, opening me more and watching Fred gasp when he noticed the view he was going to have. "Want me to fuck you, Freddie?" I teased him, caressing his dick in between my legs and teasing my own entrance with it. My ginger gasped so beautifully and tried to rock his hips to push himself inside of me."Y-yes, please, please, please," he begged in a low raspy voice. I put my hands on my knees and let him enter inside of me in just one thrust."Fuck!" Fred whimpered hissing and throbbing inside of me. I moaned when I felt him stretching me.I leant a bit forward to let him have a complete view of how he was going in and out of me. Fred hummed in approval."Good view?" I scoffed, riding him slowly, feeling every inch of him deeply sunk in me. "The best view, love. The best fucking one," he let out in a sigh, using one of his hands to caress my back. I felt his tip grazing my weakest point and making me slightly whine as I moved faster. "That's my girl. Fuck me, Lilith. Keep fucking me."Riding him and hearing his beautiful whimpers mixing with my own moans as my skin crashed against his, I clenched around him and he pulled my hair making me sit straight, back glued to his chest and his dick still deep inside of me. "I thought you wanted me to dominate you, darling," I smiled, feeling his grip on my hair stronger and his hand sneaking in between my legs to caress my clit in fast circles making me whimper and tilt my head back, resting it over his shoulder as he chuckled. He freed my hair and his arm surrounded my waist pulling me as closer to him as possible. "Oh, and I bet you loved watching me so pleading and desperate for you, am I wrong, love?" he smiled, murmuring in a deep raspy voice. "You aren't," I teased him, moving my hips again with him still deep inside. "Well, you were about to make me cum and we both know I always like to see you cum first, so now it's daddy's turn to make you whimper for me," Fred smirked, pulling out of me and pushing my back to end up staying on my knees with my chest and my face pressed against the bed. Completely exposed at him.My heart pounded hard against my chest as I heard Fred accommodating. His fingers caressed the path from my entrance to my clit and the next thing I felt was his hands holding my thighs as he sank his face in my wetness making me slightly squeal and writhe, full of pleasure."Don't pull away from me, Lilith," he murmured to then give me a wet and claiming kiss, trapping my clit in between his lips and sinking his tongue in my entrance. "Let me savour your perfect pussy."Fred continued eating me out like a thirsty animal, making me whimper and hide my face against the bed sheets as loud moans left my lips. When I was finally about to cum, he separated from me making me tremble and whine complaining, feeling his saliva mixed with my juices soaking me in between my legs and in my inner thighs."Shh, darling," he whispered, scoffing, and teasing my entrance with his tip. He grabbed my waist and deeply buried himself inside of me, making me tremble and squeeze the sheet below me. Fred started to rock his hips, thrusting into me with fierce and hunger, digging his fingers in the sensitive skin of my waist, making the two of us moan and hiss full of pleasure and wanting more from the other. Always wanting more. "Fuck, Lilith — if you could only see how beautiful you are when you fuck me. I wish I could carve this picture in my mind for the rest of my life.""Freddie — fuck, yes, right there,— you're gonna disassemble me," I bit my lower lip, feeling his dick rubbing harsh my weakest spot and making me moan as I felt myself going high into the rollercoaster and a familiar knot forming in the depth of my guts."You don't have the slightest idea of how weak you make me, Lilith Arambella," he sighed, breathing erratic and pounding hard into me, marking me as his. "Not the slightest tiniest idea."His hands in my waist pressed more as his dick kept pulsating inside of me, making me throb, and thrusting even rougher than before. Fred ran his tongue through the skin of my back following the path of my spine, leaving me speechless and making me let out a messy cry as I clenched more around him. Fred let out a soft growl and pressed more of his hips into me, glueing his hipbones to my bum and pounding even harder and rougher as hisses of pure pleasure were leaving his lips.I felt myself burning in the most delicious way possible, getting goosebumps in every inch of my body as Fred kept filling me, and feeling the stars and fireworks appearing in my sight."F-Freddie...I— oh, fucking Merlin, I'm a-about to cum — Fuck! "I cried out as I felt the current of a huge orgasm hit me when he pressed himself against me, kissing my jaw from behind.My body felt completely numb and I trembled, thinking that my knees would give up and feeling the waves of pleasure covering me from up to down as my inner walls clenched around Fred, sucking him in, and pulsating. I squeezed the sheets in between my hands, letting out a hoarse moan and barely being able to keep my eyes open."Oh, my love, how fucking gorgeous you are," Fred whispered, already pounding messy with his breathing erratic and laboured and his dick throbbing more than ever until he finally burst in a raspy and deep moan that ended up in a hiss, as he started to cum inside of me with his hands dug in my hips. "F-fuck!"He pulled out of me, completely exhausted, and laid back on the bed, watching me collapse and laid on the bed, absolutely knackered."Dear, Merlin..."I whispered, completely pleased and feeling that familiar ache in between my legs. Fred grabbed a throwaway tissue to clean me and then throw it straight to the dustbin. I pulled up my knickers as best as I could, and Fred did the same with his boxers. While I was laying on the bed lightening my cigarette, he spread a little bit my legs to lay down with the back of his head against my lower belly and my legs over his shoulders. He stroked my thighs as I gave the first puff and then put the cigarette in his lips, letting him breathe the smoke while I ran my fingers through his hair.✵ ✵ ✵"...And dear listeners, remember, the next password will be: Sirius. Have a good day — as good as it can in these days and support Harry Potter," Lee concluded, turning off the radio."I can't believe we can't talk about the Horcruxes," I huffed, already during the end of mid-September, after finishing the broadcast of the day under the password; Regulus. Probably none of our listeners would know who he was, but a few days ago, Remus arrived with some news about Harry's movements.Apparently, a few months ago they had discovered that You-know-who was making a really dark kind of magic. He had created Horcruxes, which according to Remus, consisted of fragmenting your soul into parts through murdering people and using that energy to put the piece in an object, an animal or another person.Fucking disgusting, I know.But it wasn't this what surprised me the most — I already knew that bastard was, indeed, a huge son of a bitch —, they had also discovered that Sirius's younger brother, Regulus Black, sorted in Slytherin, had not only been killed for trying to get out of the Death Eaters but also for discovering You-know-who's secret and try to destroy one of the pieces.He was a brave Slytherin whose story hadn't been known until now and who had to carry with the name of 'Death Eater' until now. I wanted to shout to the four winds that Regulus Black had been a brave and right boy till the end of his life. However, the rest didn't consider it proper to announce something like this, since letting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named know that Harry was trying to destroy the Horcruxes could mean putting Harry in even more danger.At least I convinced them to use Regulus's name as one of the passwords, to make that name ring a bell in people's minds as one of the good ones."Remus, any news about Harry's location?" George asked, when the man arrived at the hut, bringing us some food and other stuff we could need."No, mate, the only thing we know is that he's not at Grimmauld anymore after bursting into the Ministry to catch that Horcrux," he sighed. "Things are even worst now, Tonks's dad had to leave the house. They're starting to hunt muggle-borns who aren't registered.""As if it mattered whether they are registered or not," Angelina huffed, quite disappointed, "When they caught Alicia after she tried to register herself, they took her wand saying that muggle-borns aren't actually wizards, that her wand was probably stolen.""Bloody bastards," I complained, shaking my head. A thought appeared on my mind and I took a deep nervous breath before looking at Remus and ask him; "And the Malfoys? Do you know anything about them?""If you mean Draco...no, dear, I don't know anything. Just that his father is an active member inside the Death Eaters and that his mother is also somehow involved but not being officially a Death Eater since she doesn't carry the mark.""You mean Narcissa is not marked but Draco is?!" I whispered, feeling my blood freezing. "Fucking shit."Fred's hand trapped mine giving me a soft caress, "I'm sorry, darling. But, right now, even if he wasn't marked, I don't think you could save him."I scowled looking at him; "He just needs someone to show him there's hope, that it isn't too late for him. He just needs me.""Darling— " Fred tried to disagree but I quickly cut him off."Freddie, let's not argue about this, it won't end well. You know Draco means the world to me, he's like my little brother. And I know he's been a fucking cunt to you and your family, I don't excuse that behaviour of his, but I know him. You don't. I know Draco can be saved."He tightened his lips, considering my words."I think so too," Liv intervened. "I might not be as close to Draco as Lilith is but most of that behaviour is just a cover to please his dad, I can guarantee not all of him is bad. Right now, at the end of the day, he's just a boy following a wrong path that was traced for him. He still has the chance to be saved."The rest seemed still a bit hesitant but after noticing that whatever kind of argument they could have against Draco wouldn't work with me and that I genuinely believed I could help him, they finally decided that the wisest choice was to support me or at least, respect my opinion.I wasn't asking them to save him. I was informing them I would do it.During the next weeks, we kept using Potterwatch to inform about everything that we could; we started to name You-Know-Who the 'Chief Death Eater' — Georgie's idea —, Lee insisted on calling Fred 'Rodent' instead of 'Rapier' as he wanted, we also learnt that Ginny and some other students that were still at Hogwarts tried to steal the Gryffindor sword from the vault at Gringotts and the most recent news; the possibility of that son of a bitch being sighted abroad."Well, who wouldn't want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he's been putting in?" Lee scoffed, making us giggle."True. But the point is people don't get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he's out of the country: maybe he is, maybe he isn't. But the fact remains he can be faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo." Fred continued, making me almost spit the water in my mouth."Do you think the Chief Death Eater would run away if he was confronted with a nose?" I added, arching one of my eyebrows."Perhaps, bet he wouldn't smell it coming,"  George chuckled."Indeed, Dumbo. Lucky for him he doesn't have a nose. Imagine having to smell the psychopath bitch he has there every single day." said Lee."Whatever," Fred started solemnly, trying to hold back his laugh." I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but: safety first!"Even though we tried to cope with the situation with the best of our senses of humour, we still made sure that Angelina and Pauline could communicate to the French Wizarding World their need to stay alert just in case that bastard decided to travel abroad. It was highly unlikely since we kept seeing the Death Eaters' shadows flying in the air — probably looking for Harry — and normally, they wouldn't be so active unless their dear Lord was personally guiding them. Luckily for us, our spells were strong enough to keep us hidden.By the time my birthday arrived, we had spent some weeks incredibly happy about the fact that the Quibbler kept also putting into written words everything that the Prophet didn't want to publish and even being bolder than us, giving exact names and locations. Liv couldn't be prouder about her dad and luckily for her, she also got the chance to communicate once or twice with Luna by mail. However, the happiness used to quickly fade away whenever we had to communicate the deaths of the day through Potterwatch and whenever we had learnt about a new entire place being slaughtered. After receiving the news that Ted Tonks himself had seen Harry and the rest during September and that he had seen them safe and sound, we didn't get any more news about their possible location but we all decided to collectively think that they were doing fine — as fine as he could in this circumstances."Happy birthday, Lilith!" Lee hugged me early in the morning, picking me up and spinning around the room, making me giggle. When he put me back to the floor, I felt my legs trembling a little because of the morning sex Fred had put me through to celebrate the arrival of my 20s, but since I didn't want the rest of the house to know about my sexual activity, I achieved to hide it properly.Angelina, Pauline and Liv surprised me with a little cake and two candles that George managed to hand-made with Remus — being one of the original pranksters came with a lot of ideas and resources that the twins hadn't perfectionated yet — which made me feel my eyes watering as they started to sing Happy Birthday to me, being incredibly thankful and lucky of having people like them around me.We ate the cake chatting calmly and Remus gave the great news that Tonks was safe in her mum's house, with a huge belly and having a healthy pregnancy so far.Merlin! I missed her so badly!By the end of the night, when I finally got to lay down on Fred and I's bed — our bed, how fucking cool that sounded — we ended up sharing a cig, him using his arm as a pillow while my head rested on his belly and his other hand played with the rings on my hand. "How does it feel to be a 20-year-old?" he smiled, speaking with a soft and calm voice to then let out the smoke from the cigarette."The same as being a 19-year-old," I chuckled."Supposed it. But with the times going by right now, turning a year older is pure good luck, isn't it?""Innit," I smiled at him, "Especially when you are declared traitors by the Wizarding World."He huffed, ironic. "Merlin's bollocks, the audacity those bastards hold... We are the traitors to our kind but they are the ones killing people as if they didn't worth a fucking sickle.""The worst part is that this isn't anywhere close to being over," I chew my lower lip, meditating about it and feeling the exhaustion in my body.Fred hummed in agreement. "I feel 1998 is gonna be such a dark year."I turned around to look at him, being unable to keep my eyes away from his lips."Lucky me then you bring so much light to this world," I confessed, not letting him say a word before I slammed my lips against his, noticing a huge smile on his face.

When December arrived - after the cosy and calm days we got the chance to enjoy, even though being far from their families and not being able to communicate with them was being harsh for my friends - days later after Christmas, we had to connect Potterwatch again under the password; Phoenix, to give tragic news;"We regret to inform you that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric's Hollow. The evidence is that despite sightings of her out walking in Godric's Hollow, Bathilda died several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injury inflicted by Dark Magic." Lee announced."There was also evidence of a recent battle in her home, and the building next door." I struggled to say, still trying to process all the information.Harry was sighted at Godric's Hollows with Hermione, the remains of Bathilda Bagshot had been possessed by Nagini, You-Know-Who's most precious ally. Luckily, both Harry and Hermione managed to get out of there safe and sound and go back into hiding, and even though that meant we wouldn't know anything about the Potter boy for Merlin knows how much time and we hadn't received either any news about Ron, we tried all to convenience ourselves that they were able to take care of each other and to think positively."And, has the Wizarding Wireless Network News reported any of this? No." Fred protested."The Wizarding Wireless "No News" Network." George ironized with a dry tone."Sadly, these aren't the only deaths that the News Network and Daily Prophet didn't think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murder of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell. A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin both believed to be travelling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, your parents and sisters are pretty desperate for news. We have to go off the air now, but as we do, we ask you to take a moment's silence, in memory of those who have fallen." Lee finally concluded.Ted Tonks's death came as a huge bleak shock; he had been a good man with only pure intentions, even though I only met him once, I felt really sad about it and genuinely sorry for Dora and, especially, Andromeda. Losing the love of your life after fighting so hard to be with him, during a fucking war that goes specifically against them - Fuckin' Merlin, I only hope Dora can give her all the consolation both deserve.We didn't get any more news about Horcruxes being destroyed nor about Death Eaters being sighted near us, but still, 1998 arrived being as Fred predicted; a really dark year. Liv had to stop sending letters to her dad, much to her dismay, even though Remus promised her to try to stay in contact with Xenophillus as much as possible. Pauline and Angelina had to be more careful than ever with the news they were transmitted to France, and for us, it was unthinkable to set a foot out of the clearing where the hut was. Not even the forest was safe anymore.Angelina's, Liv's and Lee's birthdays came in March as a breath of fresh air and relief. Even though none of us was too much in the mood for any celebration, we managed to make their special days a bit happier than the rest and we only hoped that Pauline's birthday in May could arrive too as a happy day with all of us present.Pauline and Angie used to often spent time braiding their beautiful hair together and doing handmade jewellery while George started to teach Liv how to play the guitar. Lee got the habit of cooking and baking while Fred and I would often spend those downtimes listening to music, smoking and chatting over the most trivial things, trying to cope as best as we could with the fact that we were in the middle of a magic war.However, in mid-March, Liv received terrible news;"What do you mean that my little sister is missing?!" she burst out, paling, even more, trembling voice full of anger, sadness and concern.Remus gulped, not knowing how to reply to her while Pauline, Angelina and I immediately went straight to make sure she wasn't about to collapse."Your father gave me the news, apparently they took her in December from the Hogwarts Express when she was about to return home for Christmas. They have been threatening Xenophillus not to say anything. He doesn't know where they have her but since Harry, Ron and Hermione were recently trapped by the Snatchers, we think they might have taken them to the same place, we also think that's where they are keeping Ollivander if he's not dead-""Hang on, hang on!" I stopped him, trying to process all the information. "Trapped by the Snatchers?! And what the fuck are we doing here?! We should be out there looking for them and helping them!""Remus, Granger is a muggle-born! If she's alone with any of them Godric knows what would they do to her!" George continued, being quite alarmed. "And Merlin knows what are they doing to my brother to stop him from defending Hermione.""Calm down everyone! I have already thought about it," Remus intervened, silencing all of us in a dry tone. "Dobby the elf has a little suspicion about where they can be, I have sent him there and he can drag all of them out of there with simple elf magic that I bet the Death Eaters don't even take into consideration."We breathed slightly more relieved. Elves' magic could be so simple that often it tricked the brightest wizards because they used to underestimate it.Liv clenched her jawline as the tears started to come down her cheeks."I have to go with him," she burst, "I don't care, I have to go with him, it's my little sister who we are talking about!""Liv-" George tried to reason with her, even though he could understand her pain."No, George. Don't try to convenience me," she gulped, having her big blue eyes red and breaking my heart into pieces. "I promised my mum I would always take care of Luna. Merlin knows what are they doing to her right now while I'm here protected. I have failed her, it should be me. It fucking should be me."Olivia burst to cry and sat on the floor with her hands in her hair, hiding her face in her knees. Before anyone else, I kneeled in front of her."Listen to me, Liv. Listen to me," I started as calmly as I could, voice trembling and a huge knot in my throat since Luna also meant so much to me. "I know you want to find her and rescue her. I know and believe me that I would go with you to help her, but you have heard Remus. Harry tried to take her out of there and ended up being caught too. If they are there with her, I know they're gonna protect her. I know it.""But I need to go, Lilith" she sobbed, looking at me with begging eyes, "What if they are hurting her? What if she's crying? What if they aren't giving her the meds she needs during spring for her allergy?""She's gonna be okay, you'll see. She's stronger than what you think," Fred tried to console her as well, caressing her back."Besides, chérie, we can't let you risk yourself," Lin interlaced their hands. "We can't lose any of you.""But Pauline, we are talking about my own sister!" Liv couldn't help but explode, hiccuping in between her sobs. "I don't care if I have to die for her. I would die for her without thinking twice.""Olivia Marie Lovegood, don't shout at me," Pauline's voice became firmer. "I understand that you are desperate right now but risking yourself means leaving your dad without his daughter, Lilith and Luna without their sister, George and Fred without their best friend - and me without the love of my life," she dithered, struggling to speak as her eyes watered.Liv froze, looking at her and all the rage turned only into sadness, she burst into tears again and hugged the girl."I'm sorry - I'm s-so sorry, my love," Liv cried over her shoulder, while Pauline caressed her blonde hair. "I really didn't mean to shout to you, I'm so sorry.""It's okay, chéri. It's okay, I understand."Watching my best friend, my sister, in that circumstances was breaking my heart into pieces, and even though I could understand Pauline and my own self trying to stop her and protect her, I also understood her point of view, and if I were in her place and she was the one in danger, no person in this fucking planet would have stopped me.Suddenly, a little blue light appeared in the middle of the living room and we were surprised by a little Patronus; a chameleon. I was about to take out my wand and I heard how the rest gasped, but Liv stopped all of us."It's my dad's Patronus," she whispered, standing up to be in front of it."Livie, my dear," Xenophillus's mournful voice filled the room through the little animal. "I know you just have learnt about our Luna being missing. I just want you to know I am terribly sorry for not being able to tell you first," his voice seemed to tremble. "I didn't want to risk you. Please, my daughter, for Merlin's sake, don't move from where you are, we already know where Luna is, she's gonna be okay but please, my dear, don't move from there - I can't lose you too."The chameleon disappeared and a couple of tears left Liv's eyes again as she hugged me, hiding her face in my shoulder.We helped Liv to stand up and sit on the couch and while we waited for news, George and I sat by her side, cuddling her and hearing her sobs slowly calm down. Lin sat at the table in front of her, trapping her girlfriend's hands in between hers and making sure she didn't collapse again or had the reckless idea of running away.Lee, Fred and Angie made some tea for her so she could calm down the trembling in her entire body. I couldn't help but notice their serious faces, especially George's, who could barely take his eyes off Liv. The shine in them was the same as when he looked at Ginny and that only confirmed to me that George and Liv had developed such a huge bond that they were more family than friends by now.A couple of hours later, Remus came back to the hut, almost running while bringing a little note in his hands.Not being able to say a word, he simply handed it to Liv and we all read it above her shoulder;Luna Lovegood is okay, safe and sound in our home. So are Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ollivander and the goblin Griphook. Fleur and I are gonna keep them safe, don't worry.

We are sorry to announce the death of Dobby the elf at the hands of Bellatrix.

- Bill W.Oh, that fucking disgusting bitch. Even though the death of the little elf wasn't good news, we couldn't help but feel happy to know that the golden trio and Luna were safe with someone from the Order.Liv's relieved sigh installed a calm inside my chest, especially when I saw her smiling, kissing the note and pressing it against her chest.Good thing, finally.✵ ✵ ✵By late April, when we had returned back to this bizarre routine we had acquired, Remus came back to the hut with a huge wide smile on his face, tears in his eyes and a pair of polaroids in his trembly hands.He made all of us sit down and after taking a deep breath, he finally dared to speak with a shaky voice;"Lads, I'm so so happy to announce to you that...my baby Teddy Remus Lupin was born this night," Remus said, putting the polaroids over the table so we could see them.We all collectively gasped, excited, grabbing the pics to take a look at them.The one in my hands showed a smiley Tonks with her blonde hair and big blue eyes, clearly exhausted, showing off a beautiful baby boy with blue bright hair while Andromeda stared at them in the back with a melancholic smile."Oh, Merlin! He's so beautiful, Remus!" Angelina said, excited, showing George the picture in her hands."Aww, what a cute lad!" said Jordan, smiling."Dora says he looks so much like me," Remus couldn't help but keep smiling, biting his lip to hold back his tears. "And the best thing is that he hasn't inherited my lycanthropy. Instead, he's a Metamorphmagus!""That's great!" I clapped excited, doing a little jump on the couch. "I told you he would be a healthy and gorgeous baby!"Remus kneeled in front of me, catching my hands in between his and looking at me with his eyes full of affection;"Would you like to be his godmother, dear?""What?!" I burst, both excited and surprised."Yeah, I talked about it with Tonks and we both agreed that you are the perfect one to be not only Teddy's older sister but also his protector and godmother.""Oh, Merlin's fuckin' balls, of course yes!" I exclaimed, pressing the picture of the baby against my chest.Edward 'Teddy' Remus Lupin, godson of Lilith Medea Lupin. How bloody good that sounded.

During the night of the 1st of May of 1998, we still weren't completely aware of what was about to happen within just hours. However, the heaviness in our hearts and the grey ambience out there was more than just an augury of what was waiting for us. It was a confirmation. A warning. A slap on our faces telling us to get ready.Lee had the great idea to take out of the refrigerator some beers and spend some time trying to diffuse the tension as much as possible, chatting and drinking, trying to cope with the situation and ignore the huge pressure growing in our chests."So, lads, what are our plans once we finish all this shit?" Lee said, giving a sip to his beer, using his wand to tie up his afro hair and sitting on the floor, making us form a circle.Once we finish all this shit, not 

 we finish this shit."I'm definitely going to finish my degree, I need to return to the muggle world for a bit," Liv quickly said, between Lin's legs, leaning against her chest. "Return to my flat and try to help as many people as possible.""Yes, me too," said the Bélier girl, "I want to finally work at the French Ministry. I don't care if I have to get a licence to travel every day from Paris to London, I just want to achieve my dream life.""We want to keep working at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, it was going too well to let it drop and I really miss that time of our lives," said George with a little smile on his face, while Fred nodded."I'll probably try to study something related to journalism. I genuinely want to keep informing people and give them the real news," replied Angelina, with a dreamy smile on her face as she laid her head on George's lap. "What about you Lee?""Probably keep working at the Quibbler, since Xeno decided to pay real money to his workers, he has given me one of the highest salaries. I couldn't be happier about it," Jordan grinned. "What about you, Lilith?"I took a deep breath, meditating about it."Probably stay in the Harpies," I said after a while, "Keep livin' with Liv and Lin until they kick me out," the girls giggled, shaking her head at my little joke. "and just that. Don't have great plans."A mischievous look appeared in Lee's eyes and he shared an accomplice look with George and with Lee."Maybe find a boyfriend or a girlfriend? Get married, have kids...y'know, that sort of things?" he asked on the sly, giving another sip to his beer.I froze in my place, feeling my eyes opening widely but managing to keep it discreet as I looked at Fred from the corner of my eyes. The ginger cleared his throat and a little frown appeared on his eyebrows."I- I don't know, to be honest. I'm only 20 years old and I don't have a stable partner, besides I still need a lot of therapy to learn how to deal with children and not pass into them my parental traumas. Kids are the least of my worries at this moment," I shrugged, playing down."You're beautiful enough, mate. You'll find someone perfect for you soon," George winked at me, gaining a deep and sharp glare from his twin."I agree," Angie said, "I'm surprised that you didn't get more suitors when we were at school. I mean, I get that they prejudiced you so wrongly, but girl, you are literally stunning. I can guarantee you that in Gryffindor we all thought you were on the top list of most beautiful girls from our course.""Tell us about it!" Liv popped off, rolling her eyes with a little smile, "They used to hate her, yes, but they were also so quick to say how badly they wanted to fuck her, especially in the seventh year. I had to stop Draco more than once because he wanted to hex them for disrespecting her.""Well, mate, we genuinely hope that once you get married we'll be invited to the wedding," George smiled.I was slightly shocked about this topic, so I just simply nodded, still quite puzzled;"Of course, Georgie.""Lads, I need a cigarette," Fred burst out suddenly in a voice that seemed to hide certain anger in its ring, standing up and walking outside without waiting for our response.Oh, he was pissed off."Need one too, see you in a bit, lot," I said, standing up as well, way calmer and giving a little smile to my friend who grinned back at me with complicity.I followed Fred outside to the porch, and after closing the door behind me, I found him leaning against the little house's fence. The evening wind moving his hair as he observed the view in front of the hut, lightning furiously the cig in his hands."Freddie," I called him with a soft tone, watching carefully how he took a deep breath and slowly turned around to face me, with a cigarette hanging from his fingers and thousands of words silenced in his brown eyes. "What happened?"He hesitated."I don't like hearing them talking like that about you," he let out in a soft murmur, swallowing hard. "I can't.""About what, darling?" I asked confused, and he ran his fingers through his hair, struggling to find the words and huffing."About you getting married, having kids, moving on from me..." Fred finally let out.What, in Merlin's balls?I was completely shocked. My lips slowly opened, puzzled and I looked at him absolutely astonished and caught by surprise. Before I could even think about speaking again, he snorted, shook his head and went back to look at me, with his soft voice;"Call me selfish but I don't want to stop having what we have. I don't want to imagine you finding someone else. I don't want to imagine you getting married, having kids - kissing other lips that aren't mine. Call me a selfish bastard, Lilith, because I don't want to imagine someone else getting in between your legs and making you reach the stars. Call me selfish, possessive, a fucking wanker if you want - but I don't want you to stop being mine."His beautiful eyes slightly watered and he bit his lower lip. I felt my entire body burning as those words got carved in my mind. I couldn't think of anything else. I couldn't even perceive anything else that wasn't him.In a burst of confidence, I covered the distance between us and trapped his face into my hands to fuse our lips together. The kiss was slow, meaningful, intense, burning - perfect."What if I tell you I don't want to stop being yours, Freddie?" I whispered against his lips, staring straight into his eyes and watching the sparkles in them shining with more strength as his pupils grew in his irises, darkening them.Fred's lips curled into a little smile and before I could say anything else - such as finally fucking tell him I was in love with him - he slammed his lips into mine again, silencing me and making me his as his only touch.He ran his hand around my waist and pulled me closer to his body, glueing me to his chest as his tongue kept playing with mine, burning me with his touch. Melting all the cold inside of me. Driving crazy the poor butterflies inside my stomach.He cupped my bum and I surrounded his hips with my legs, wanting him even closer to me."I want you to know, Fred Weasley, that you are one of the most beautiful gifts life has given me," I whispered, pressing our foreheads together, closing my eyes to feel him better, to breathe him better.He went back to kiss me, getting us inside the hut. Luckily, the rest seemed to have gone to sleep because the living room was completely empty. Fred guided us upstairs clumsily, forgetting anything else but us existed, to our dorm where he laid me over the bed, locked the door and cast a Muffliato, coming immediately back at me.Without breaking our slow and claiming kiss even once, we got rid of our clothes, feeling each other skin against skin, heat against heat, memorising every part of us, hands caressing everywhere, trying to carve each other's body in the memory of our fingertips, tracing slowly every curve, sharing goosebumps."I'd be the luckiest man on Earth if I could spend the rest of my life worshipping you in the bedroom, my love," Fred whispered, caressing softly the skin of my breasts, going slowly down to my waist and my hips. His lips started to cover my neck and my collarbones as I pulled softly his ginger hair, watching it slide in between my fingers as little furious flames. I tilted my head back, closing my eyes when I felt his hips glueing to mine, grinding all of him against all of me. Letting me feel him as his lips kept burning me.If this was what heaven felt like, I wouldn't mind this being my last day on Earth.It didn't matter how many times we had had each other; ours was a deep hunger that never seemed to be pleased. Every time was just as perfect as the previous one if not better, every time we looked at each other was as if we had never seen us naked, every time we kissed was as if a thunderstorm exploded in the depth of me.Fuck, I only wanted to never leave from in between his arms.After tempting me, making me almost beg, Fred entered inside of me in a slow but hard thrust, crashing his hip bones against mine, making me softly moan and drowning his own raspy one in the curve of my neck, letting me hear his laboured breathing as he pushed all of him inside of me, making the two of us pant. My hands went straight to his back as he hid his face in my neck, covering me with his corporal warmth and Fred gasped when I clenched around him, making him rock his hips slightly rougher but still keeping that slow rhythm that was slowly and deliciously killing me."Fuck!," he whimpered softly when he got even deeper, feeling the pressure in between my legs and fusing us together even more. "My Lilith,-" he kissed my neck, driving shivers all over me, "my girl - my life."As he kept his pounds inside of me, pushing himself rougher and harder, he started to spread soft kisses all over my face, making me hug his body to pull him even closer to him."Freddie..." I called him in a soft whisper, almost unnoticeable, as my legs tangled around his hips and my hands went straight to his hair, hearing him pant so beautifully that I thought I was already reaching the stars."What?" he said in the same hushed tone that would have sounded innocent if it wasn't because he was deep buried inside of me."I'll never get tired of this. No one will ever kiss me, caress me, make me as happy as you do. No one." I said, hearing his pants as he kept pushing inside with his body slightly trembling. "I don't want to stop being yours, Fred Weasley."Fred smiled and fused our lips again, showing me how badly he actually wanted me and proving to myself once again how deeply rooted he was in me. Feeling the familiar knot in my stomach, my inner walls tightening around him and his messy thursts as he whimpered softly, we both came, for the first time at the same time, in each other's arms, fusing our orgasms together in a bewitching melody formed by our last moan.My ginger let himself fall over my body, completely exhausted, grabbing his wand to cast a little cleaning spell, and pulling out of me only to lay back over me again and fall asleep in between my arms, body against body, his face hidden in the connection between my neck and my collarbones and my heart synchronizing with his.God, Universe, or whoever you are up there, please, don't take him away from me.✵ ✵ ✵A little knock on the door woke us up."Fred, mate," George's voice spoke from behind the door, as Fred started to move, complaining a little bit and separating from me, much to our dismay, to lay on his back. "Time to get up, dad's here. We are needed.""Fucking hell..." Fred whispered with his sleepy and raspy morning voice while he ran his hand through his face, trying to mentally prepare."Good morning, Freddie," I murmured, leaving a soft kiss on his lips that he gladly replied."Morning, beautiful. What time is it?""Looks like past midday."Fred snorted and finally stood up from bed, starting to get dressed. I imitated him and soon we were out there, back in the living room with our mates.As soon as he saw that his father was healthy and looking good, Fred ran to hug him, quite excited and relaxed. Arthur corresponded his son's hug, pressing him tightly against his body. George smiled, showing that he already had the chance to do exactly the same when his father arrived."Good to know all of you are safe," Arthur said, sitting down on the couch and giving us a warm smile."How's mum? And Ginny?" Fred quickly asked."Do we have any news about Harry, Ron and Hermione?" George added, immediately."They are fine. And that's exactly why I came here. Harry's okay, he's getting Aberforth Dumbledore's help and after months and months of looking for those cursed objects, he has finally found out that two of them are in Hogwarts. Apparently, there were seven, he has already destroyed three.""And what's the plan?" Liv asked, getting ready for the action."Since Severus Snape is the new Headmaster and Death Eaters themselves are now Professors, Harry can't appear out of the blue. We have come up with a plan and we will need you there.""We are ready for it," we seven said at the same time."Great because we will need as many people as necessary. That bastard doesn't only count with the Death Eaters' support but also has giants, dementors and Merlin knows what other creatures in his rows.""I can bring the Harpies!" I burst out."Yeah, and I can notify the people from the Quibbler. Knowing that Xeno's daughters will be there, I'm sure that more than one would love to fight," Lee added."Magnificient. Get ready, kids. We will reunite at Hogwarts during the evening with the entire Order," Arthur sighed. "And keep in mind that this is not going to be easy. Merlin knows what is going to happen but if we stay together and manage to protect Harry... we might have luck enough to fucking finish off that son of a bitch."We all nodded at the same time, meditating the words and feeling the adrenaline flooding our veins.Ready for the action.

"How much we will have to wait?" Aileen whispered, full of adrenaline as we hid behind one of the walls, watching how the poor students were guided to the Hall by the spiteful and disgusting Carrow siblings. I saw the melancholic looks in most of the Gryffindors, some Slytherins trying to hide the paleness in their faces by trying to pull the stereotypical arrogant look of us, the Hufflepuffs making sure to stay together and not leave anyone back and the Ravenclaws observing silently every single detail, trying to recompile their courage. Most of them looked painfully devastated, exhausted and even physically hurt.Fucking shit, I wish my come back to Hogwarts wasn't like this."Just a little bit longer," Khaleelah reminded de McDonald girl in a soft murmur. "So we simply just burst into the room and start cursing Death Eaters' arses? 'cause I'm up for it!" she said, excited."We still have to wait for the sign. Harry has to confront my uncle first, and right there is when we appear," I repeated the plan to the rest of the six girls.My eyes found Fred's from across the place, he was also hiding, next to his twin, his dad, Remus and Kingsley.I started to hear Severus's voice from inside the Hall, but the adrenaline running high in my veins and the nervousness didn't allow me to focus on his words.The collective gasp mouthed by the students when Harry revealed himself wearing Gryffindor's robes was the sign we were waiting for, opening the huge door from the Hall and entering inside, showing our support to the Potter boy. Our walking was firmer, fierce and secure as we approached, making a little barrier behind Harry. My eyes met my uncle's and I couldn't help but feel my veins going as cold as ice itself, but I didn't flinch. I wasn't going to hesitate.We were all there; Remus, Kingsley, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Neville, Luna, Bill, Fleur, Angelina, Lee, George, Fred, Liv, Hermione, Pauline, Ron, Dean Thomas and us, The Harpies."Tell them what happened that night!" Harry shouted at Severus, while the man observed him slightly deadpan and paler; he had been caught by surprise. "Tell them how you looked into his eyes, a man who trusted you, and you killed him!"All eyes were on us, as expected. Everyone seemed to be holding their breaths and I noticed how the Carrows were touching their forearms, possibly calling their beloved Lord.Much to our surprise, Severus pointed with his wand at Harry, but McGonagall quickly pushed the boy, being her the one confronting my uncle. Severus seemed to hesitate for a second but still held his wand firmly, which made us lift ours as well.McGonagall started to throw spells at Severus and while the rest kept waiting for him to attack, I noticed something."He's not defending himself." I couldn't help but whisper.Another spell. Another deviation.Another spell. And this time, what I saw really made me freeze in my place.Severus redirected discreetly McGonagall's attacks to the Carrows, knocking them out and transforming himself into that black shadow to fly to the window. But before he broke the glass to escape, with McGonagall calling him a coward in the background, I couldn't help but notice how he stopped incredibly briefly on both siblings and took their wands.I gasped.Wasn't anyone noticing it?!"Girls, wait right here," I immediately whispered, running to get out of the hall with Fred's voice in the distance shouting my name;"LILITH!"But I didn't listen to him. Severus was my priority right now.I saw him landing on the ground, looking back to the window, ready to start running, but I stopped him;"Severus," I murmured, watching how both his black outfit and hair fused with the dark night. He seemed to be exhausted and his skin was paler than ever."What are you doing here, for Merlin's sake? Do you value your life so little?" he hissed, gulping.I shook my head slowly, trying to process what just happened; "I saw what you've just done."He took a deep breath."You took their wands, didn't you? What is all this, Severus?" I asked, without giving him time to reply. "Why is a Death Eater sabotaging his fellow mates? And don't bother to tell me I'm wrong because I know you way better than what you think."Snape took a deep breath and pulling an Occlumency spell around us, he grabbed my wrist, making sure his fingers were digging into my skin;"I do not have enough time right now to explain to you in full detail what I am trying to do." Severus's voice sounded inside of my head, while he forced me to keep eye contact with him. "I have never considered becoming a Death Eater since the Dark Lord fell in October of 1981. I stopped being a Death Eater then and I have never gone back to it. I have been sabotaging them from inside, making sure to fulfil Dumbledore's orders. I am not asking you by any means to understand my reasons for this, I only want you to know, that even though you might think I have failed you, I want you to be safe. You know well I do not know how to put my feelings into words, but you are not your mother, Lilith. You are not her and I am incredibly and profoundly proud of the woman you have become."He broke the Occlumency, freeing my arm and starting to walk away without giving me a second look."You should go before your mother arrives," Severus said quite dryly, ignoring the absolute expression of pure shock on my face."But you tried to curse me — back in August, you tried to curse. How am I supposed to believe that all of that it's actually true?" I talked back, struggling to find my words, feeling the cold trespassing my skin and digging deep into my bones.Severus froze in his place and without even look at me, he simply mumbled;"That curse was never directed to you."And he simply turned again into that dark shadow and left me there. Completely astonished and speechless.Seeing how the protective spells were trying to cover the entire school, my mind started to work at a dizzy velocity.Severus wasn't a Death Eater, Severus had been trying to break the Death Eater society from inside. He had been putting himself at risk by being a spy next to one of the biggest masters in Legemerency. Severus wasn't a Death Eater...My mind soon woke up again.Fred. I need Fred. I got inside immediately, running to the biggest towers where I knew they would be since that was part of our plan. The air felt insufficient as I went upstairs trying to avoid the students who were running in the opposite direction.When I finally arrived at the tower, pretty much out of breath, I found both him and George looking to the sky with their faces quite devastated. Fireworks started to appear in my sight I noticed that it wasn't exactly fireworks, but the Death Eaters' hexes trying to penetrate and break the barrier protecting the school.Both twins had their eyes watered and their breathings were incredibly heavy and erratic."You okay, Freddie?" George asked in a whisper to his twin, without putting his eyes away from the sky."Yeah," his twin nodded, trying to keep it together."Freddie," I called him in a murmur, watching the two of them immediately turn around to face me. George seemed relieved and Fred clicked his tongue while grabbing my wrist and slamming me against his chest into a strong hug."Don't you dare to escape from my side alone again, Lilith. Wherever you go, you go with me, with George or with Remus. What in Merlin's sake were you thinking about?" he said, quite serious."I had someone to speak with before this shit starts," I whispered, I was still hugging him when I saw a familiar blonde hair running to hug Remus. "What the fuck are you doing here, woman?!"Tonks turned around to look at me, she was looking just exactly like the last time I saw her;"Lilith, mate!" she ran to hug me. I hugged her back, feeling relieved to know she was okay but still quite angry at the fact that she was here."You shouldn't be here, Dora. You just gave birth to a baby, for Merlin's sake!" She shook her head still smiling; "I left Teddy with my mum. I need to be here, Lilith, I know it."I was about to answer back when a huge hit destroyed one of the protection spells, allowing the black shadows to enter inside the school, letting us hear already Bellatrix's psychopath laughter.Fred was the first to react, "Let's go! They are gonna need us down there!"As we were running to get to the frontal part of the castle, I couldn't help but notice through the broken windows how the forbidden forest was set on fire and how the dome over the castle formed by protective spell was little by little giving up."Lilith!" I heard a familiar voice that made my heart shrank. Draco came running to me, looking way maturer but also devastated than the last time I saw him. I wrapped my arms around him tightly thanking Merlin that, so far, he was okay, and as soon as he felt my touch, my poor boy burst into sobs."I'm s-sorry, I'm so sorry," he cried against my shoulder."It's okay, my boy, it's okay," I hushed him, pressing him tightly against me. Observing a nervous and out-of-breath Blaise behind him, I couldn't help but notice a huge detail that was scaping my mind."We are the Slytherin kids?!" I asked, worried. McGonagall looked at me, with that strong shield of hers completely broken into pieces, her face covered with a huge sad expression showing the wrinkles and exhaustion in her face."I sent them to the Dungeons, I can't let innocent children fight their own parents."I gulped, understanding her point of view but highly disagreeing."Professor, some of them, of us, need to close these awful circles with our corrupted families. Some of us need to fight them so we can let them go and show everyone that Slytherin is way more than evilness and pureblood obsession. I agree not to force them to fight if they don't want to, but the ones who want should be here. Please, Minerva."She seemed to think my words for a couple of seconds and after taking a deep breath, considering it, she finally nodded."Draco, if you want to do the correct choice for once in your life, go to the Dungeons and open the door for every Slytherin that wants to fight. The more people the better.""But — what if they fight for them?"I sighed, "Then they have made their choice — and I can do nothing more."Malfoy finally agreed and accompanied by Blaise, he managed to sneak discreetly inside the castle.The night had already arrived, welcoming us with a foggy and heavy ambience as we saw Voldermort's army entering the castle, with their wands ready, throwing curses and trying to destroy everything in their path.I saw my teammates, getting ready in their brooms, starting to fly next to Wood and his Quidditch team to fight the Death Eaters in the air. Grabbing my wand as tightly as I could, with my heart pounding so hard against my chest I thought my ribs would break, we started throwing and blocking curses. Liv and Pauline behind me, making sure to stay together, Fred and George by my side, forming a weird barrier."LET'S GO, MOTHERFUCKERS!" Charlie Weasley shouted, excited, showing his bravery, opening the dark grey clouds and entering the battle scene riding one of his dragons; an immense Ukranian Ironbelly, followed by another two Chinese Fireballs that were also controlled by him.We were fighting hard, curse after curse, watching how our own mates were collapsing, exhausted, devastated, ruined.The shadows of some Death Eaters started to fly above us and we managed to create a huge brief barrier by driving our wands to the floor. However, one of those filthy bastards managed to avoid it and fly right above our heads, and of course, it couldn't be anyone else but Circe herself."CRUCIO!" she pointed from the air, straight at me. Before I could even react I felt a tall body hugging me and pushing me to the floor, falling over me, avoiding the curse.Circe growled still in the air and continued trying to curse the rest as I noticed how George, Dora, Remus, Kingsley, Liv, Pauline and some more ran to us, trying to block her attacks."Are you okay? Did the curse hit you?" Fred said, helping me to stand up."WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING, FREDERICK GIDEON WEASLEY?!" I burst out, standing up, feeling my nerves on edge and the fire running through my veins, "THE CURSE COULD HAVE HIT YOU!"I could have lost you."I already told you once I'm not letting her hurt you!" he replied standing up in front of me with his breathing becoming heavy and faster."You have to let me fight her!""Not even in a million years," he snorted with an ironic chuckle, that was far away from being funny.The frustration filled every inch of me."Why not?!" "BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, YOU IDIOT!" Fred burst out, breathing heavy and with his eyes shining in the dark night. He ran his hands through his hair, shaking his head and finally letting down all his barriers "I love you so much I don't even care if you don't love me back, I have love enough for the two of us. For this life and all the coming ones."Fred breathed, his eyes now free of those silenced words, his chest going violently up and down as his lips were half-open, trying to catch as much air as he could. The shine in his eyes spread more covering the brown, he breathed as if he had been drowning until now, he had straightened his back as if he had just dropped a huge weight that no longer was crashing his shoulders. He was scared, I could read it in his face, but he was also liberated.Oh, dear Merlin, my Freddie.I let out all the air I was holding, feeling myself gasping and slightly choking with it, completely caught by surprise. I suspected he was catching feelings for me, strong feelings, but the word 'love' literally got deep inside my veins, burning them."Freddie..." I started in a little whisper, he immediately shook his head with his eyes watering, biting his lips to contain the tears."Don't — don't say anything you don't mean, Lilith. I promise you it's okay if you don't love me, that won't change anything. You are the love of my life, no matter what happens tonight, tomorrow or in 20 years. I just needed to finally tell you because it was consuming me and I-""Freddie," I called him again, feeling my heart exploding in tenderness. He stopped talking and stared at me nervously. "Look."I pointed my wand at a group of dementors that were trying to approach us, five or six, hungry to steal our happy memories;"Expecto Patronum" I whispered, watching how my magpie got out of the blue light and made go back all those filthy and disgusting dark creatures with such power that even surprised me. Fred kept staring at me, eyes wide open and paler before. His lower lip trembled as he watched the magpie returning to me and resting on my shoulder, looking at him curiously. He grabbed his wand and slowly moved it in the air, making the same enchantment as me, without breaking our eye contact."Expecto Patronum"My old German Sheppard came out of his wand, making me burst into tears of pure happiness, as the dog approached me, rubbing its nose against mine in a soft and delicate caress."I don't know if it's love or not, I don't know if his Patronus changed too or not, but I do know he has to feel something for you. I just simply know."

Oh, Olivia, you are always fucking right.I looked back at Fred and watching how a tear started to come down his cheeks as he was trying to hold back a huge wide smile, we shortened the steps separating us and fused into an intense kiss.We kissed as we have never kissed before. Being flooded by the intensity, the warmth, the touch of our lips against each other's, his hands wrapped around my waist and my hand caressing his cheek. A warm fire started to grow in the deepest part of my guts, spreading all over my body and feeling my heart exploding in pure happiness, as the few tears coming down from our eyes got lost and drowned in our mouths. Being closer than ever with our patrons flying in circles, wrapping us and protecting us, creating a truly magical scene.Oh, my dear love.I broke the kiss and without separating for him, not even the tiniest inch, I pressed my forehead against his, hearing his soft and almost unnoticeable hiccups for having contained his tears for so long, and whispered against his lips;"I love you, Fred Weasley," I whispered, watching carefully his reaction, "I love you so much that I lack air when you are not with me.""FINALLY!" George, Liv, Pauline, Angelina, Lee, Remus and Tonks burst at the same time, making us separate a little bit and watching our Patronus going back into our wands."Took you some time, you blithering idiots," George smiled, coming straight to hug us."We were a bit blind," I murmured, giving Freddie an accomplice look and finally being able to see those eyes full of love towards me.Merlin, how I didn't see it first? How could I not see how he looks at me? What did I do so good in this life to deserve this, to deserve him?"Too fucking blind," Olivia and Pauline crossed their arms at the same time and rolled their eyes with a little smile on their faces."Alright, kids, even though I'm so happy to see that my dearest daughter has finally opened her eyes," Remus joked, driving the attention back to the grey situation over us, "It's time to go back to the battle,"We nodded, and Fred interlaced his hands with mine, giving me one last kiss.I watched, swallowing the fear, how the second part of Voldemort's army, full of some of the strongest Death Eaters, entered the castle. With George's help, we made sure to throw one of the Lestranges from his broom, making him land Merlin knows where."Perce!" Fred burst running towards his older brother.They blocked some of the curses from known Death Eaters and I was about to run to help them when I saw Rockwood next to the wall in front of them, giving me a spiteful smirk, full of bad intentions."You are actually joking, Perce," Fred laughed. "I don't think I've seen you joke since you were—"BOOM.

Fred collapsed against the floor, with his eyes closed and with such a hard hit that I felt how the air escaped from my own lungs."George!" I grabbed the other twin's sleeve pointing at Fred on the floor. George got paler and he immediately started running towards his twin, trying to avoid the few curses that were still being thrown and with me following him right behind.We both kneeled on the floor watching Fred still not moving."No, no, no, you son of a bitch, you better not be leaving me, blithering fuckin' wanker," George started to nervously mumble as I felt the tears starting to group in my eyes while he opened a bit Fred's shirt so he could catch air better.If he was still catching air...

Fucking Merlin, it should be me. It should be me, not him."You better not leave your girl right now when you have just confessed, you fucking idiot, don't fuck with me like this," George protested again, trying to find Fred's pulse in his wrist while we felt all Weasleys running towards us, making a little circle.I burst into tears, pressing my face against his chest.Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me.

It should be me the one going, not you. It should be me.All the joy inside my heart had left me, leaving a sharply painful void in it."Don't you dare to leave me, Fred Weasley," I sobbed, against the fabric of his clothes. "You fucking promised you wouldn't leave me!" My tears started to wet his pullover as George started to get even more frustrated since he was still struggling to find Fred's pulse. Percy Weasley, behind us, was breathing incredibly erratic as if he was about to pass out and all the Weasleys, Liv and Pauline were holding their breaths, trying to contain the tears just in case they were mourning too soon."Don't leave me, Fred. I love you so much to let you go. I love you so much to lose you, please" I sobbed, choking with my own hiccups and tears. "Or at least take me with you. For Merlin's sake, Fred, take me with you. I can't live without you. Please, Freddie — please."Then I heard it.His heart was beating."IT'S BEATING!" I announced, incredibly nervous and relieved."HE HAS PULSE!" George said at the same time, with tears coming down his face with his fingers around his twin's wrist.Fred took a deep breath, opening his eyes widely, with his face full of dust and some stains of blood. "Merlin's fucking left ball, what the hell—?" he burst, trying to catch air. He sat straight as best as he could and looked at all of us, slightly confused, especially focusing on me and paling at the sight of my tears. "Who died?""You almost did, you daft prick!" George replied, chuckling, wiping off his tears and hugging his brother."Did I?" Fred asked, quite puzzled, hugging back his twin. "Godric's balls, how fucking ironic would be me dying from a bloody explosion when I'm the biggest arsonist next to Seamus?"George separated from him and his eyes quickly went straight to stare at me, his look softened and a little tender smile appeared on his face."Don't look at me with those watery eyes, my love, you're gonna break my heart," he spoke in a soft voice, shaking his head.I threw myself to him, hugging and pressing him as tight as I could against me."You almost broke mine, Freddie. I can't live without you, you know that, do you?" I whispered, caressing his hair and making sure he was actually here, with me. "I'd rather die with you than live in a world where you are not there."Fred clicked his tongue, pressing me more against him, "Oh, my love.""Oh, c'mon, don't tell me he didn't die!" we heard a voice behind us. I separated from Fred and stood up to find Rockwood's genuine annoyed smile. "Circe wanted him dead."Fucking bastard.I opened the path between the Weasleys, watching most of them dispersing back into the battle. Walking like a snake observing its prey, I stood in front of that bastard with my wand pointing at him, giving him the deadliest of my looks;"You made a huge mistake, Rockwood," I mumbled, drained off all emotion other than the rage. "Your stupid brainless mind chose not only to mess with me but with someone I love, in particular, you chose to mess with my Fred. And no one hurts my Fred and lives to tell the tale."Rockwood chuckled, ironic."What're you gonna do, Little Circe? You proved you're just a traitor who likes to mix with the pathetic scumbags from the Order. What are you gonna do? Cast me an Expelliarmus?" he fakely pouted.I smirked, full of sarcasm."Oh, no. In case you have forgotten I'm Circe Snape's daughter and your dear mate Yaxley was right, I might be a 'traitor' but I have the mind of a Death Eater," I hissed, calmly, watching him get paler. "And you know what a Death Eater does when someone touches their family, don't you?"He was about to curse me but I was faster;"Langlock!" he fell to the floor, static, and I approached him slowly, like a snake just about to attack. " You've got too much in my face, you son of a bitch. I think we have had enough of each other."I lifted my leg and kicked his face, hard, so hard that he spit two of his teeth in front of me, giving me a despised and scared stare."Your mother — was wrong," he spat on the floor, trying to catch air again. "You are not like your father — you are just like her."My smile was colder and deadlier as I whispered;"Good for you then. You already know the way I'm about to kill you."His eyes flinched as he saw me pointing my wand up again."This is for being a fucking innocents' murderer, for helping my mother to break me — and for almost killing the love of my life," I sentenced, watching the fear in his face; "Imperio."The man's body lifted from the floor like a dismal muppet. My heart pounded slowly in my chest as I controlled him. "Crash yourself into the wall, Rockwood."He did so, smashing his body harshly against the hard dusty wall, letting me hear how he broke several bones. The fire in my veins ran as lava, burning me and pushing me to the edge;"Now, throw yourself from the bridge," I hissed, giving a last triumphal stare to his disgusting filthy begging eyes. Uselessly trying to fight back the curse, his legs started to move slowly and clumsily, like a robot, as I heard him struggling, leaving in front of my eyes quite an unpleasant view. Rockwood stood up at the edge of the bridge;"Pl-please, don't do it. Don't—" he begged.You chose it."Jump." I simply said, watching him struggle again and finally letting himself fall to the void, in silence.Breathing deeply, I turned around and found only Liv, Pauline, Fred and George staring completely surprised at me."Wow," George said.Liv surprised face faded slowly away and she looked at me with a little smile on her face;"How does revenge taste?"I smiled back at her; "Fucking delicious.""He deserved it," Pauline agreed."I have to say," Fred interrupted, stuttering and still absolutely shocked. "I-I'm quite both turned on and scared. Turned on by that amazing kick you gave him — fucking hot it was. And scared about that," he pointed at the place where Rockwood fell, "remind me to never mess with you again, love."I chuckled, walking towards him."Well, I couldn't let him get away with it so easy considering he almost took you away from me," I whispered, looking at his lips.He smiled, cupping my cheek with his hand and leaving a soft kiss on my lips."Good to know I have my beautiful girlfriend as my pretty bodyguard," he scoffed, grazing his lips with mine.I hid a gasp. "G-Girlfriend?"He nodded slowly, "If you want to."My smile widened so much that my cheeks hurt and I kissed him again."Fred Weasley being my boyfriend? What a lucky bitch I have to be...""Don't mean to impose this really waited and cheesy moment, mates," George giggled, putting his arm around Liv's and Pauline's shoulders. "But, there's a war going out there."Fred and I snickered at the same time."Let's go, then. Wanna kick some Death Eaters' arses."✵ ✵ ✵They were dead. The two of them, in front of my own eyes. He died duelling Dolohov, he had told me weeks before how his body wasn't working as before, how he suspected he wouldn't survive much longer after the war because of his condition, and the lack of care from the Ministry and St. Mungo's was slowly killing and exhausting him. That's why he asked me to be Teddy's godmother; because he knew I would take care of his child as if he was my own."Hold it, please. Hold it, don't leave me, please, " I sobbed, grabbing his hand and trying to maintain him alive while the wound in his body didn't heal. "Teddy needs you, Tonks needs you. I need you, please. Don't leave."He grabbed my hand, trying to draw a little smile through the pain."Take care of them — please, tell them how much I love them," he managed to murmur in a slow and soft voice that let me know how life was little by little abandoning him. I cried, even more, feeling my heart breaking into millions of pieces, noticing how I couldn't have anything beautiful in my life without having something else being taken away from me. It wasn't fucking fair. "I'll be good, dear - I'm finally going with him."Him. Sirius.I knew he was going to leave, I didn't want to believe it, I wanted to save him. But I knew he couldn't be saved.Watching him struggle with the pain, I observed that he had lived with it since he was a kid, for so much time that he might have even forgotten what it felt to live without pain. I couldn't let him go in pain too.Catching his hand in between mine, I silently cast a charm Flitwick taught us in our seventh year. A charm that only people who genuinely loved someone were up to do for that loved one.I took away his pain, suffering it in my body. Feeling as if my skin and my organs were exploding with thousands of knives inside. He looked at the sky keeping that tiny smile on his face as a single tear left his eyes before closing them forever;"It d-doesn't hurt," he whispered, with a hint of relief and ghoulish happiness in his exhausted voice.I didn't even get time to mourn him when the bitch of Bellatrix took her away from me. She had arrived at where he was peacefully laying, and for the first time in my life; I saw her crying, I saw her devastated, I saw her breaking.But, when I was about to console her, to hug her and to mourn with her, the disgusting bitch of Bellatrix appeared out of nowhere, cursing her in less than a minute, catching her by surprise.Her own fucking aunt.I didn't even see the light hitting her, I just saw her slowly falling, next to him, eyes closed and her face relaxing.Their hands almost touching.As soon as she fell, a huge horrifying scream torn my throat, filling the air. I felt my heart breaking into millions of pieces and my lungs choking with my own tears.No, no, no, fucking no.

What about my baby Teddy? What about me? What about them?Fred immediately kneeled by my side, holding me in between his arms and pressing me against him, making sure I didn't collapse, showing me his support and letting me cry over his shoulder.He even had to grab my face to make me move my eyes from them and order me to breathe since I was starting to have an anxiety attack. My chest was going up and down violently but little air was entering my lungs."Breath deep and slowly, Lilith, try to breathe deep and slowly," he whispered, holding my face into his hands, looking at me straight in the eyes. "Please, my love, you can't slip through my fingers like this now that I finally have you."I hugged him again, feeling I would dry out on the inside because of so much crying. Feeling my heart going numb, I distinguished the two of them in the distance, observing in the dark, rejoicing in our pain.I stopped feeling sorrow, once again, I only felt rage. This time even more than before.Bellatrix looked at me and smirked, transforming again into that shadow and flying away, I growled red in rage as I moved from Fred and started running;"LILITH!" I heard Liv calling me between sobs, but I didn't hear. I kept running."DOLOHOV!" I shouted, wiping off the tears of my eyes. He mocked me by running instead of turning again into one of those shadows, but when he was about to arrive to jump and transform, I grabbed my wand and cursed him out loud, full of pure rage;"Langlock!" I used the same curse, but on my inside, I was planning to hurt him way more than how I hurt Rockwood. The man fell to the ground like a muppet. This time, I didn't even give him the chance to speak. "Sectumsempra!"The curse penetrated hard into his body, gaining a huge scream of pure pain as his skin was being completely cut, bleeding out. He looked at me with despise, trying to bear with the pain and he spat some blood into the ground. Last thing you do in this life, you son of a bitch."Reducto," I simply cast, dryly, no emotion. And the ashes of what had been Dolohov's body fell to the ground, being taken away by the wind as if he had never actually existed.This time revenge didn't taste that good in my mouth. This time it was just a dull sour flavour, knowing that even though I had avenged the ones killed by him, nothing would bring them back.I took a deep breath, closing my eyes for a moment, trying to think about the things that could make me want to keep living;Fred.

Olivia.

Pauline.

Teddy."Lilith," a feminine voice called me, making me slowly turn around.My eyes would have opened widely if I had had the energy.

"Plums?" I asked surprised, watching her face covered in dust and certain stains of blood. She was looking exhausted, her hazel eyes lacking all that Gryffindor fierce that she carried and the expression on her face showing the pain she was trying to swallow. I snorted, kinda annoyed. "I don't have time for you right now."I was about to go away when she trapped my wrist, making me turn around to face her again."Don't go, Lilith, please," she said, swallowing hard. It was the first time since we met that she called me by my name, so I stopped, scowling and paying attention to her."What do you want?" I spat, confused."I- dear Godric, I don't even know how to start," Plums stuttered, taking a deep breath. "I want to apologise to you.""Come again?" I replied, absolutely astonished.Is this a fucking joke?"I want to say sorry to you for everything I have both said and done to you," she finally managed to say. "I understand if you don't forgive me, nothing excuses my behaviour, but - if I don't survive this night, I just simply know I can't go without apologising to you."I took a deep breath;"I just want to know why. Why were you so persistent in branding me as a Death Eater when you knew I wasn't one? I thought it was just simple internalized misogyny or maybe the fact that you are a Gryffindor who suffered because of the Death Eaters- but I know there's more, am I right?"Sienna sighed, nodding;"I loved him," she whispered, trembly voice, and the grip in my wrist hesitant, "and incredibly selfishly, I knew you weren't a Death Eater, but I wanted you to be one so he would stop loving you. In my twisted mind, I ended up lying to myself and even convincing myself that you were on your mother's side just because I was scared of him putting his eyes on you."It's still not fair for me."I was a fucking idiot," Sienna chuckled nervously, "I thought I could stop his feelings for you, but I couldn't. Fred's deeply and immensely in love with you, Lilith. He's been in love with you for too long now and I have known it even before him. That's why I always hated you so furiously. Because I envied you."Envy me? The only good thing that happened in my life is my friends and Fred. How could a rich, half-blood from a good family, Gryffindor girl possibly envy me?"I was a bitch," she continued, "I judged without listening to you, I made your life impossible every time I could and you can't even imagine how embarrassed I feel of myself. I can't do pretty much about it but just ask for your forgiveness, even though I'd totally understand if you can't give it to me."Sienna Plums, the woman who spent her entire time at Hogwarts fucking up my life, was asking me to forgive her.She had been a total pain in the arse for me, that was undeniable. And it didn't matter how much she could apologise, I would always hold grudges against her but...due to the situation in which we were and the immense possibility of not getting alive out of it, I considered saying the next words, still quite hesitant;"I forgive you, Sienna," I finally sighed, watching her face relax.I was still expecting her to pull one of her tricks at any moment. I was still doubting. I was still grabbing my wand so tightly I could feel it pressing hard against my hand."This isn't gonna make us friends, though."She gulped and nodded. "I understand it. I understand you don't trust me. I just want to change y'know? This man - Greyback," her eyes slightly watered and she seemed to stumble with her own words. "He bit me. He made me one of them. That's why Marco broke up with me, he thought I would be turning into a beast and even though I tried to explain to him I wasn't, even though I tried to prove it to him, he didn't listen. Then I understood that was my punishment for having treated you in the same way for so many years. Only because of jealousy.""Greyback bit you?" I repeated in a whisper, completely surprised.That fucking bastard didn't stop hurting people."Yes," Sienna's voice trembled, "during-""Avada Kedavra!" A familiar voice spoke behind Sienna, hitting her with the green light and making her instantly fall in front of me, almost taking me to the floor with her.Sienna's body fell with a gloomy and dull sound to the rocky floor, no blood, no sound from her, no nothing. Just her inert eyes wide open. Life leaving her in less than someone breathes. So ephemeral, so easy to take away.I moved to kneel in front of her, my eyes sorting back to the performer of the curse.And there she was.Fucking bitch, will you ever leave me alone?"No one other than me is killing my daughter, you filthy halfbreed," Circe spat with a smile on her face, glaring at Sienna's still warm corpse."She wasn't trying to kill me, you fucking bitch," I muttered, feeling how the grey fog penetrated my skin and hold tightly to my bones."Well, then that's mommy's revenge for all the years she spent fucking up your life.""She was apologising," I whispered, looking at the Gryffindor girl, closing her eyes as a sign of respect to her death. "If you are going to kill me you better do it now, Circe, because the moment I catch my wand again you'll be pretty much done."Circe snickered;"You know I never wanted to kill you, right?" she started with a deeper voice. "You know me perfectly well, Lili, I actually loved you, you were my baby girl, my little Lili...until you betrayed me," her voice trembled and her eyes became sharper. "and your betrayal hurt me almost as much as your father's one did. I had a perfect life for me and you. Together, as we should have been. Merlin knows after the Dark Lord's fall I could have escaped, avoided Azkaban and create a new life out of here but I didn't because you wouldn't be there. My baby Lili, my avenger angel. I waited for you inside of that pigsty they called jail, but you never came. Your body was there, looking just like your father, but you never came.""Your selfishness ruined my childhood, Circe," I spat, standing up."No, your father ruined your childhood, Lili," she stated, pretty firmly. "It was your henchmen the ones who threatened to rape me," I spat.And surprisingly, her eyes opened widely and her wand seemed to tremble in her hands."They — they touched you in that way?""Kingsley and Fred arrived first before they could do so.  But they didn't hesitate to say how you wouldn't mind it."Circe scowled. "Lilith, I might be a murderer, I might have given my entire life to the Dark Lord's cause and I might believe you have betrayed me and therefore you deserve to die. But I would never, and listen to me well, Lilith, NEVER let someone touch you in that way. You are my daughter and even though I did use my henchmen to hurt you, I still think this is something between you and me, and even I have certain limits."I snorted. "And you pretend me to believe you.""I never lied to you about what I have done, have I? I told you everything I did during the last war, and I'm about to tell you how I took care of your father."My blood froze."What do you mean?" I scowled."I found him," she said, pretty proud, sending shivers all over my body. "That's why it took me so long to go back to the Arambella House to look for you, baby. Because I found him in a little and isolated village in Wales, and I killed him. I got him begging at my feet, crying - and Merlin knows your father never cried - asking for my forgiveness, showing himself as someone inferior. But it didn't work for him, I had too much rage to let him live...and to let her live.""Her?""He had married again," she snorted, ironic, "his whore was pregnant. He begged me to save the child, maybe he thought he could do with that creature the same he tried with you, but I don't know if his birth was magical or not. I just know he begged, Lili. He begged me and I destroyed him and everything he loved the most," a scary smile covered her face. "I avenged myself."I can't say Ares's death meant something to me nowadays, but murdering an innocent pregnant woman? How could she? What point of madness was Circe reaching?"You are fucking out of your mind," I shook my head."Why do you think it took me so long to find you at the Arambella House, baby?" she scoffed, "I knew you were going to be there since the moment I learnt that you had been interrogated by Yaxley, my Patronus spent hours and hours watching you and those other traitors while I spent my time finding him. I'm your mother, Lili, I know you even better than yourself."I sighed frustrated, thinking about what I was about to reply when a hissing voice interrupted us."So that is what you were doing when I ordered you to look for Harry Potter... Once, again, you disappoint me, Circe."There he was, the fucking culprit of all this shit.It was the first time in my life that I saw him in reality and even though I want to say I wasn't scared, I literally shivered in terror. He was just as scary as Harry had described him, maybe even more.I froze in my place, behind Circe."Dark Lord..." she stuttered, looking actually scared.I have never seen her scared."I still looked for the Potter boy, my lord. I promise you I did," Circe replied, sounding quite childish.The man - if you could call him that - tutted, disagreeing."No, Circe. Don't lie to me, you know I don't tolerate lies. You have been a good server, but your obsession with your half-breed daughter and with that muggle always stopped your potential."Circe gulped, nervous."I want you to know that your brother is dead," he announced as if it was the most normal thing in the world.I felt knives running in my veins.Severus too? Who else did this son of a bitch want to take away from me? Did he learn Severus was actually spying on him, trying to destroy him?Circe didn't react further than just clenching her jaw. "If that was your will, then so be it, my lord.""Don't act as if you care about my will, Circe. You have just confessed you don't. That's why I see myself forced to stop this. You might have been a good ally but not only you Snapes are no longer useful but also you seem to put other priorities of yours over me. And I can't tolerate that.""But Dark Lord-"Voldemort's eyes darkened with wickedness and looking straight into my mother's eyes, he finally spoke again, interrupting her;"If you want to prove your loyalty to me. If you really want to be by my side during the powerful era that will come once I have killed the Potter boy, you have to do something for me.""Whatever you want, my lord.""Kill your daughter."I gasped, feeling my mind dizzy. So, that was it, all of this fighting...just for nothing. She was going to win.Circe gulped. She seemed hesitant, something that surprised me since she always bragged about how badly she wanted to be the one killing me.My mother turned around to face me, pointing me with her wand, pressing the tip of it against my neck as I struggled to breathe because of the adrenaline and the fear in my body. My fucking wand was on the floor next to Sienna's body.Dear Merlin, I was going to die killed by my mother. Far from Fred.I looked at Circe straight in the eye, challenging her."Go on. Let's end this once and for fucking all, don't make your dear Dark Lord wait," I spat in a whisper.Come on, you bitch.Her breathing was erratic and her hands started to tremble as she kept looking at me. When I thought she was finally going to curse me, she sighed."I can't," she whispered, "I can't, my lord. Even being a traitor, she's my daughter. She's my baby. I don't care if she has to be imprisoned for betraying me, but I can't kill her. I was the one giving life to her, I can't be the one taking it away from her."I gasped, swallowing hard, keeping eye contact with her and biting my inner cheek not to burst into tears.Why you couldn't stand for me before? Why you couldn't be the mother I needed? Why did you have to tear our bond? Why did you have to hurt me?"Circe, you always manifested how you wanted to be the one killing her," Voldemort protested.My mother's eyes didn't move from mine, but she put down her wand."Yes," she murmured, "but I only wanted to scare her, I wanted to pressure her to join me. I can't kill her, my lord. She's my Lili."Circe turned around to face him and put her body in front of me. Was she going to protect me now after all these years? "Then, once again, you disappoint me and betray me, Circe. What a shame," he tutted.Voldemort pointed his wand at her without letting her even speak, watching straight into her dark eyes as he cursed her;"Avada Kedavra!"My mother's trembling disappeared, my mother's breathing stopped. She fell to the floor, a few steps away from where Sienna's cold corpse was also laying, with her black eyes empty and the pieces of hair covering her face.My whole body trembled as I watch her, the air felt trapped in my lungs and my eyes opened so widely I thought they would fall from my face."I'm not going to waste my magic killing you," Voldemort addressed me, driving even more cold shivers all over my spine. "I'll let Bellatrix have that honour. I suggest you enjoy these last moments of life, even though your blood is polluted and you have made all the wrong choices, I still hold some respect as a fellow Slytherin and magic person."And he simply left.I couldn't even react, I couldn't even pick up my wand at him and curse him for all the pain he had made me go through.I only could keep my eyes on her.How bloody ironic was that her beloved and dear Dark Lord was the one killing her, betraying her?

How bloody ironic was that I survived my mother?

I should feel happy about her being gone, I should feel free from her, I should feel relieved...then why did I feel such heavy pressure on my heart?I kneeled in front of her, I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it the same way I couldn't help but put away the hair from her face and close her eyes. I observed her, memorising and carving her image in my mind.We were more similar than what we both wanted to admit, I had a lot of her in me even though I always tried not to claim it, to distance myself from her. She had always been right; I would always carry a part of her in me.As a single tear went down my face, I caught her still warm hand in mine. The first time I was touching her without violence involved since before Azkaban."I wish things could have been different between me and you," I whispered, stuttering and tongue-tied. "I wish we could have had a different end. But even though that's not possible, I want you to know that - I forgive you. I forgive you, mum."And I really meant it. I meant it even more than my forgiveness towards Sienna, I meant it more than all the times I said that I hated her.That's how I let her go.That's how I finally let Circe go out of my life.Watching the grisly scene around me, I finally stood up, walking slowly away from the corpses of two women who hurt me but who I decided to forgive.I found Fred outside, facing the bridge, accompanied by the rest as they observed a huge group of Death Eaters slowly approaching us.There were no words needed between him and me, as soon as he saw the devastation in my face, he pulled me closer to him, kissed my forehead, and interlaced his hand with mine, showing me he wasn't planning to let me go.As we saw the immense dark group approaching, rejoicing in our pain and our exhaustion, we couldn't help but observe Professor Hagrid's disturbed face as he was forced by them to walk, carrying a weight that in his hands looked little.We hadn't had time to process anything, when Voldemort opened his path between his followers to announce, full of joy, the next words that almost made me faint if it wasn't because Fred was holding me tight against him;"HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!"

Ginny's scream of pure sorrow filled the air as we all started to feel the heaviness, the exhaustion and the pain in the ambience.He was gone. All of this for nothing.As Voldemort spoke, I noticed everyone's faces declining while the Death Eaters and their allies rejoiced in our pain. It wasn't fucking fair, it wasn't fucking fair.My eyes met Avery's — whose face was pretty much full of scars because of Fred —, next to Greyback, for a second and I immediately grabbed my wand tightly in between my hands as I got closer to Fred, instinctively looking for his protection. I watched him from the corner of my eyes clenching his jaw, closing his fists while glaring at those two beasts and for a good moment I thought he would jump at them.Merlin knows what would happen to us now that Harry, our only hope to end with that bastard, was gone. Dying was probably the most merciful option.Neville, as the brave and persistent Gryffindor he was, decided to face Voldemort, tell him how we wouldn't submit to his atrocious will, tell him how we would fight till the end."I want you to know," Fred murmured in my ear, still watching to the front, "those bastards will have to go over my dead body to put a single finger of theirs on you."I was about to reply when Harry threw himself from Hagrid's arms. Scaring the living shit out of all of us and driving us immediately fast back into the battle. He was fucking alive."POTTER!" Draco shouted, throwing his wand at Harry and running towards me, much to the Death Eaters' both dismay and surprise. I trapped him into my arms, hugging him and making sure he was okay.YES, FUCKING YES.

My Draco has finally chosen the right thing to do, my Draco has finally saved himself."You're doing amazing, my boy," I said to him, "I'm incredibly proud of you."As soon as Harry took the wand, the battle started again. I don't know where we took the energy from, but we decided to use all the possible strength in our exhausted bodies to fight as hard as we could.My eyes immediately focused on Greyback and feeling the old rage flooding my body I started running towards him. I heard how Liv, Pauline and Fred were running behind me, but I didn't stop.I needed to end with that son of a bitch.He doesn't know I have a fucking silver dagger in my boot ready to be dug in his disgusting flesh."Little Circe," he greeted me, licking his lips and watching my face of disgust. "Came to let me do what Yaxley suggested to you at the Ministry? Because nothing could make this day happier but that."I felt disgusted, threatened and completely viewed as an object.Fred growled behind me and I saw how he was about to jump at the werewolf if it wasn't because Liv and Pauline put their wands on his chest."No," Liv said, glaring at Greyback. "Let her do it.""She's the one who has to avenge herself," Pauline added.Fred seemed to hesitate, his face was red with rage and his breathing was erratic, but he stayed in his place.I smiled at Greyback, cynic, while my friends made a circle around us, blocking the curses from other Death Eaters. I observed him, the fucking son of a bitch was looking incredibly healthy, of course, because he could free his inner wold whenever the fuck he wanted.Bloody filthy repulsive bastard.Before he could even react, I grabbed the dagger from my boot and dug it deeply in his abdomen, making him instantly growl in pain, touching the place where he had been stabbed."You fucking whore," he complained, trying to press his bleeding wound and watching how the burgundy — almost black because of his extreme use of dark magic — blood was flooding his clothes. I kicked him with all the strength in my body, making him fall over the ground.Without letting him even speak, I positioned myself on top of him and pressed my thumbs harshly against his eyes, watching him writhing in the ground and starting to hear his screams of pain as I kept trying to take his eyes out, as I had promised to Yaxley."PL-PLEASE, MERCY! MERCY!" he begged as my fingers dug deeply into his bleeding cavities."Mercy? " I scoffed in a cold voice, grumbling. "You dare to ask me for mercy? Did you have mercy for me when you almost killed me ripping me with your claws, you son of a bitch? Would you have had mercy if Yaxley had actually called you to sexually abuse me? No. I think the fuck no.""Y-YOUR MOTHER! IT WAS ALL YOUR MOTHER!" he screamed, desperate."My mother has paid her crimes with death, Greyback.""PLEASE," he kept begging, as I finally managed to grab his eyes in my hands covered by his blood."This is for biting children and teenagers and basically destroying their life. This is for that 5-year-old kid you bit 33 years ago, Remus Lupin, I bet you remember his name," I repeated in a cold whisper as I watched how the man would have cried and whimpered if he could use his eyes. I uprooted them with a dull sound and threw them away, watching Greback writhing under me as he took his hands to the two bleeding holes where his eyes had been before. "And this, you son of a bitch, this is for me." I punched his face, knocking him out. "Remember, Greyback, remember Lilith Lupin was the one who destroyed you."I didn't know if he was alive or not. I didn't care whatsoever. Remus had taught me how a werewolf's eyes were one of their biggest powers since it helped them to visualize once they were in the wolf form and without them, most of the werewolves didn't survive further from a couple of days.I had avenged both myself my real father.With my hands covered in his blood, I applied a water spell to clean them. The last thing I wanted was to have anything of him on me. "Let's go, we still have a battle to fight,"  I said, with my hands trembling, feeling completely overwhelmed.I am a murderer. I have killed people. Guilty people, but people after all.

I am a murderer.

Fuck's sake, I might have forgiven Circe but I certainly don't want to be like her.

I want to vomit.Fred seemed to see the disturbance in my face, because he immediately approached me and cupped my cheeks with his hands, making me look at him."I know what you are thinking," he whispered. "I fucking know it, love. And let me tell you no one thinks you are like Circe. Absolutely no one, because you are not. He deserved it, that fucking bastard would have both raped you and killed you if he had been given the chance to. He almost killed you, he deserved every ounce of pain you gave him. And the same goes for Rockwood and Dolohov. Don't chew into it so much, my love, you can't imagine how much I admire both you and your bravery so don't let those bastards make you feel bad. You took justice into your own hands, as the strong woman you are, because you had to.""Fred's right, mate," Liv nodded, "You did what you had to do.""We can't expect everything to be a bloody bed of roses." Pauline agreed. "He didn't hesitate to tear your flesh till the bone. He would have killed you if Remus and Fred hadn't taken you out of there."I took a deep breath."I just don't want to be like Circe.""You won't." They said at the same time, supporting me."A'right," I smiled at them. "Let's go, we need to help the rest.""Together?" Liv positioned at my side, offering me her hand while Pauline imitated her action on my other side. Fred observing us, proud, in front of us."Together, sisters," I grabbed their hands, ready to get back into the fight.Everyone from both sides was giving their bests. Harry and Voldemort were probably fighting in the air, nowhere to be seen. The curses and hexes covered the entire place as people were falling or compiling their last breath of energy to keep fighting.I saw Bellatrix on a table, pointing at Ginny with her wand, probably ready to kill her. But before Fred could throw a curse to that bitch to throw her far from his little sister, Molly walked to the table, pulling her daughter behind her and pointing her wand at Bellatrix, whose psychopath and crazy self had the great idea to mock Mrs Weasley."Not to my daughter, you bitch," she mumbled, cursing the Lestrange woman with a weird curse that went straight into her heart and that seemed to have dried her body, making her skin glue to her bones and taking the air from her lungs.However, before Molly could hit her again, a sword went through Bellatrix's abdomen from her back, making her burst into thousands of pieces that seemed more like paper and ashes than a human body, instantly killing her.Finally.Grabbing that sword, the Gryffindor sword, was an exhausted grown-up Neville, holding it with fierce as he breathed quite heavily, with a little bleeding wound in his eyebrows."That was for my parents and for almost killing me at the Department of Mysteries," he muttered, looking at where the ashes of the woman were falling.I watched him, proud. My boy was learning to defend himself."Well done, Nev!" I shouted, encouraging him.Then I noticed something, the Gryffindor sword...Neville himself had told me today that Harry said the sword was one of the weapons against the Horcruxes, and if I wasn't wrong, the bitch of Nagini was the last Horcrux left."NEVILLE! THE SNAKE!" I shouted, sharing what I just had clicked on with him.He seemed to understand it and opening widely his eyes, he nodded and ran towards the centre of the battle where we saw Ron and Hermione completely soaked in Merlin knows what, about to be attacked by that creature.Nagini was about to bite them, finally kill them without any of us being able to do anything against her because of how difficult was to attack from the distance. But instead of witnessing my friends' death, I saw how Neville cut the snake's neck in just one cut.Yes. 

Finally.

We are finally free.We turned around, watching Voldemort's confused and disturbed face as he felt how the last piece of his soul was dead, in front of an exhausted, covered in dust and blood, but complete Harry.Both pointed their wands at each other. This was a thing between them, and only between them.The two lights collided, green versus red. Freedom versus a life sentencing to be tortured because of who we were.It didn't take too long for Harry's spell to defeat Voldemort's, showing him how his wonderful wand wouldn't work against the Potter bow, showing him his time in this world had finally come to an end.The curses stopped and Voldemort's grey and lifeless body started to disintegrate into ashes. We held all our breathing for a good couple of seconds as the ashes were falling in the foggy morning. Merlin's balls, I hadn't even noticed when dusk started.Suddenly, we let out a collective sigh of pure relief and triumph.

Fucking finally.

"Bloody hell, I'm knackered," Liv murmured with a little smile, laying on the floor in a starfish position, resting her eyes. "Can't wait to go back to the flat."Pauline took a deep breath, sitting next to her girlfriend. "I'm gonna sleep for seven days straight.""Fuck yes, bed sounds like the most appealing thing at the moment," Fred agreed, imitating her action and surrounding my waist with his hands to drag me to the floor with him, pulling me as close as possible and caressing me. "And you are sleeping with me, right, my love?" he rubbed his nose with mine, having a little smile on his face.I gave him the same sort of smile, feeling both my body and my emotions still quite numb because of the night we just had, because of all the feelings he had to process and we would have to process in the future.But, if this war had taught me something, it was that we needed to enjoy every single moment we were breathing. Life was so ephemeral, so easy to slip through someone's fingers, that we were allowed to, at least, have a moment in peace."Of course, Freddie."I filled my lungs with air and finally relaxed my shoulders.Bloody hell, we were so lucky.

We won the war.

The first couple of weeks right after the war, I kept my eyes on Lilith constantly.I knew she was trying to cope with the situation as best as she could, I knew she was trying to smile and keep going with her life, but I knew her too well, even better than what she thought.I knew my girl was constantly thinking about the ones she lost during the battle, I knew Lilith felt guilty and I knew that whenever she wasn't sleeping with me, she would have nightmares in which she repeated the moment when she killed those bastards and when she saw people dying right in front of her.Her mind was playing against her once again, and I couldn't allow it.The first thing I did when George told me he and Angie had finally decided to occupy the flat right above ours, was to suggest Lilith move with me here.I might sound like a fucking cheesy bastard, but when she accepted, I thought my heart would exploit with happiness. I wanted her to be as close to me as possible, I wanted to take care of her, I wanted to protect her and hold her into my arms so no one ever again could hurt her.She accepted, she wanted to stay close to Liv and Pauline but also give them their own space as a couple, and knowing she could be in the flat right in front of theirs, with Georgie above us and living with me, made her accept almost immediately with her gorgeous green eyes filling up with tears.Godric's balls, I would kill for those eyes...Living with her was the best decision I ever made. I loved waking up every morning and seeing her by my side, with those curls spread all over my pillow, those green eyes looking at me, full of love, and those lips smiling at me, making me feel full of life.I loved being hers; being able to spend time alone, just the two of us. Eating with her, finding her in any corner of my flat doing Merlin knows what, having little details of her in every place of our home, cuddling with her after work, chatting, laughing, loving her at every possible chance I was given... It was perfect.Fuck, I loved my life.Lilith was, without any doubt, the love of my life. I don't know when I started loving her, I don't know when she got so rooted inside of me that I felt I couldn't breathe if she was not there with me. And I still remember what a fucking idiot I was when I tried to convince myself that I hated her.I used to observe her, trying to know what kind of mysteries that doll face hid because I never liked secrets. Back in the day, I used to believe I wanted to know about her because I wanted to know how to attack her, now I know it was because she had completely mesmerized me.At first, it was just pure raw physical attraction and sexual tension between the two of us. Two Beaters from opponent teams, the prankster from Gryffindor and the mysterious and mean girl from Slytherin."You've got to be honest, lad, Little Snape does have a good fuck. Have you seen those legs?!" people in my house used to say, trying to make me open about that rejection I had towards her."Imagine what she can do with that bitchy tongue of hers!"

"Nah, put her on her knees and watch all the bitchness getting out of her body," Nowadays those comments about her make me physically sick, back in the day, only made me focus my eyes on her.I hate her. But look at those lips, how would it feel to kiss her? I fucking hate her. But look at those hypnotic eyes. I fucking hate her so bloody much. But look at her skin, how soft it seems...how badly I wanna touch her, how badly I wanna feel her.I used to hear her arguing with me and having my mind flooded about thoughts of Lilith begging me to touch her and me slamming her against the wall, opening her legs and fusing with her, making her reach the stars and showing her that, much to her dismay, I was the best option to turn her in the beautiful ruined mess she was. Sienna used to rant in the common room about how disgusting she found her while I was daydreaming of making Lilith cum so many times she would finally learn to respect me. I was supposed to find her repulsive, she was a Slytherin, the daughter of a Death Eater and my biggest opponent in Quidditch, I was supposed to think of her like pure venom. But for Godric's sake...what an addictive venom. I was supposed to feel reject towards her and yet there I was, fucking pumping myself dry almost every night, thinking and trying to imagine how fucking legendary, explosive and intense would be to have her. Wondering who was the lucky bastard who got the chance to be with her, wondering if it was fucking Malfoy and trying to know what in Merlin's balls I would have to do to occupy his place. And she didn't help me with it — oh, no, Merlin forgives if Lilith ever made things easier for me! — appearing in front of me with the cigarette hanging from her rosy lips and those skirts that drove me mad, swinging her hips as she walked, making me drool at every movement.Fucking Godric, I even moaned her name while kissing Sienna during the night after the Yule Ball.I thought I only needed to fuck her to finally forget her, to finally get her out of my system, but, Godric's fucking balls, how wrong I was. After trapping me with her physique, she trapped me with her personality. She had that emotional shield in front of her, trying to look like she couldn't give less of a fuck about anything, seeming like she could stab you with the nearest dagger and then continue painting her nails in black as if nothing had happened, but I knew she also had a soft side. Not only Malfoy adored her, but also that Hufflepuff Lovegood girl she was so keen to defend. It got proved to me when Neville himself started also to worship her even though she was his boggart's niece.That intense eager desire for her only grew when she confessed to me in a burst of anger that she had fucked Cedric.Because I never felt so flooded by jealousy. Because I never wanted so much to break Diggory's face but also be him. Because I was internally burning to be in between those legs.The only thought of him knowing how her moans sounded, knowing how she felt on the inside, touching that skin of hers, was what invaded me of rage making me brave enough to finally slam her against the wall of that changing room and finally kiss her. Feeling that hungry desire getting slightly soothed and proving to her no one would ever please her as I could.And when I finally had her during that summer, when I finally got to make her mine for the first time, as I was deep trapped inside of her, I could only think that Lilith felt like heaven itself and that she had me profoundly wrapped around her finger because I would never have enough of her. I could only think about how no one would ever fuck me better than she did.That's when I knew I was completely hers.George knew it, as he always knows everything about me and I know everything about him, and he thought I was a 'foolish dim-witted knobhead idiot' for not telling her how I felt. His exact words, not mine.I don't know which of all her virtues was the one that made me fall in love with her, or if it was more of a mix of all of them. But when I discovered that my Patronus had changed into a German Sheppard, I simply knew it. I had fallen in love with all of her.I was Lilith Arambella's and Lilith Arambella's only. And I was so blind and so consumed by my feelings, wanting so badly for her to fall for me as much as I had fallen for her, that I didn't notice she had already done it.During those months, I only kept falling more, and more, and more for her. Godric, I never thought so much love could fit inside a single body.When I confessed to her, tired of almost losing her so many times, tired of feeling her slipping through my fingers, I felt the luckiest man of the whole universe knowing that she felt the same for me.And now, months later after the war, there she was.My Lilith.I leaned against the door's frame of our dorm, watching her in front of the window of the kitchen, rocking little Teddy in her arms as she told him Merlin knows which story in between soft whispers.Merlin, how much I love her...At first, she was scared of not being good enough for Teddy because of all those traumas in her past that belittled her, but I convinced her that her love for that baby would be more than enough to make him happy.And there she was, being the best godmother to ever exist. Both her and Harry would often go to Andromeda's place to spend time with the poor woman and with Teddy, and once a week, she would bring the baby home to fully enjoy him.I loved that little lad as well, he was one of the reasons why my girl genuinely smiled again. With just his presence, he made her understand that staying in that loop of sorrow was only hurting her and that not Remus nor Tonks would have liked to see her like that. He was just a few months old and yet brought so much joy to all of us."Look what a pretty view I have," I murmured, calling her attention as I approached her. She turned around to look and smile at me, reminding me how much at her feet I was.I hugged her from behind, resting my chin on her shoulder and feeling how her blueberry and peony smell drove me back home — because she was my home."I'm telling Teddy that time you put that fire salamander in my Quidditch uniform," she smiled, making me melt right there.I snickered, pulling Lilith softly closer to my body. "That was a good one. Might start teaching little Teddy to be a prankster just like me."She snorted, ironic, "Well, love, then maybe I should start getting ready for it, shouldn't I?"I will never get tired of hearing her calling me 'love'."Yeah, you definitely should," I smiled, and then softly tickled Teddy, watching him laugh and changing his hair colour into a lighter blue, something he would do whenever he was happy. "Right, little fella?"I noticed the love in Lilith's eyes as she caressed Teddy's cheek. I wanted her to be mine for the rest of our lives, I deeply wanted to be the father of her kids and age together till we are two old grumpy grandparents who only bear with each other.But I knew she wasn't ready to be a mum. She was still going to therapy at St Mungo's every week with that colleague of Liv, and she was making lots of progress — especially considering that everyone saw her as a war hero and an incredibly strong woman — but she wasn't ready for that.And I didn't care if she was never going to be ready for that. Teddy was enough for us.I would die before pressuring my girl into doing something she doesn't want.She started to softly hum Blackbird by The Beatles, something she would often do when she was thinking about Remus but didn't want to cry."Our dad once told me nothing can go wrong when you are listening to The Beatles," she whispered, looking at Teddy. "I bet right now he's probably blasting Let It Be as he watches us," she giggled, "your mum is probably complaining about how posh it is and she's probably trying to put Nirvana on. What a woman she was, you would have loved her."She had learnt to turn that sorrow and sadness into positive thoughts and I couldn't be happier watching her healing."Well, she has a point you know, nothing can go wrong either when you are listening to Nirvana, remember that time we fuck—""Fred!" she complained, laughing, "There are kids in front of us.""Bah, Teddy doesn't even know in which world he lives, he's probably thinking about in which shade of blue he's gonna turn his hair,""HE'S DOESN'T KNOW BUT WE DO, AND WE ARE HEARING YOU TWO, YOU PAIR OF HORNY BITCHES." George shouted from his window, above our flat, making both Lilith and I giggle."SHUT UP, GEORGE, WE HAD TO HEAR YOU AND ANGIE FUCKING IN THE KITCHEN YESTERDAY BECAUSE YOU LEFT YOUR FUCKING WINDOW OPENED!" Liv complained, sticking out her window and trying to hold back her laugh.Teddy learnt to speak before the average kid, and closer to his first birthday when he was already able to call Andromeda 'granny' in that baby babbling language, he surprised us by calling Lilith 'Lili' and me something that sounded similar to 'Freddie'. My girl burst into tears as soon as she heard him and even though I thought she would be sad, those were tears of joy.She had learnt to associate the nickname 'Lili' to Teddy and not the bitch of the woman who gave birth to her.As we were laying on the couch, watching that muggle device she called 'telly' and cuddling together as we got the habit to do, I couldn't help but think about how lucky I was.I loved the little family we had created with our friends and little Teddy.I loved the life I was creating next to her.I loved her more than anything else in this world.

1st September, 2017"Well, Mrs Lupin-Weasley, once again it's a pleasure to be your therapist. The progress you have made is absolutely worthy to be proud of," the brunette woman in front of me closed her notebook, observing me with a gentle smile.I huffed, smiling, "Alice, after 19 years treating me you're still gonna call me 'Mrs'?"The woman rolled her eyes, giggling."Ugh, I'm sorry, Lilith, we had an inspection yesterday and they keep saying we have to keep some distance with the patients. Olivia thought it was quite stupid since we've been treating the same people since the war ended but you know...""Where is she now, by the way? I saw her today early in the morning.""Oh, she asked for permission to take Maeve to Beauxbatons, you know it's her first day as a witch."I smiled.Maeve Khady Bélier was Liv's and Pauline's daughter and my second godchild. By 2005, both girls decided that they wanted a larger family further than their loved cats, so they adopted a beautiful muggle baby of curly golden hair, tanned skin and big blue eyes. But what a surprise it was to all of us when just a few months ago, a letter arrived for Maeve from the magic school of Beauxbatons. Liv was completely astonished and Pauline screamed all over the house showing how proud she was about their girl going to her school since she carried first Lin's surname. Both of them were the best mums to their girl and Maeve grew to be a wonderful young woman well-educated and with a huge emotional intelligence."She's probably crying right now because she has to leave her baby for more than a day," I giggled.Standing up from my seat and hugging Alice, I finally got out of her office. As I went downstairs in the hospital, I saw Draco running in his uniform, ready to take it off since he was probably late to pick up Scorpius, his son and my third godchild. He waved at me in the distance, smiling and putting his blonde hair out of his face. After the war, Draco was still carrying guilt over his shoulders, which made him want to remedy all the harm he had helped to do, by studying magical medicine and becoming a doctor here at St Mungo's, and one of the most respected ones!When I arrived on the first floor, my eyes rambled through the crowd of people trying to find that familiar ginger head. I immediately saw him when he stood up to receive me with a  huge smile on his face. He hadn't changed that much during these years, his ginger hair kept brightening hard, his face had only some little wrinkles near his eyes and his body was just as perfect as before, the only sign of age on Fred was the maturity and experience in his eyes that hadn't lost either its mischievous tone."Well, darling?" he whispered, giving me a quick kiss. "How was it today?""Really good," I smiled at him. "Where did you leave our three beasts?"Fred giggled, making me melt at his view.Almost 20 years together and he still had me at his feet..."They are with Roxanne and Jordan.""Did you leave the twins with Roxanne?! Oh, Merlin, poor Angie!"Right after the war ended, I decided to untie all my trauma and hidden emotions by going to therapy, freeing myself and learning how to be my best version. That relief only encouraged me to keep going. I got back into the Harpies for a good couple of years and then started working at The Quibbler with Lee and Angie in the sports section, I took care of my Teddy as much as I could and nowadays he was a handsome and kind 19-year-old boy incredibly similar to Remus but with Tonks's smile and humour.Fred was there for me all the time, as always. He proposed to me on my 21st birthday and we both agreed that since I didn't want to stop being Lilith Lupin, we wouldn't have a traditional wedding. Instead, our ceremony was a huge party at the Burrow shared with Angelina and George and officiated by a slightly drunk Harry with Liv, Lee, Katie and Draco as our witnesses and Pauline as our golden bridesmaid. It was such a happy day that even though I missed with all my heart those who were missing, I couldn't have been happier being married to the love of my life.After a couple of months, by the end of 2000, I started chewing into something. Teddy was starting to get older and I knew Fred was craving another baby but, of course, he didn't pressure me nor mentioned it. In fact, he always insisted on how we didn't need babies of our own because Teddy was more than enough but watching him growing up made me also want a little addition to our family.I consulted it with my therapist and making sure I would be the best mum my kids could have, Alice finally convinced me and I decided to talk to Fred about it. I think it's worthy to mention that he, in fact, started crying with pure joy. But since the Weasleys are never a little addition, in 2001 I found out that I was pregnant and not with one, but with TWO babies. Merlin was really testing me by giving me twins with Fred's DNA. I still remembered when the doctor gave me the news. I was completely astonished and Fred started shouting, excited. Cassandra Dora Weasley-Lupin and Sabrina Roma Weasley-Lupin were born two days before my birthday, a couple of weeks later than George and Angie's babygirl, Roxanne. They were absolutely gorgeous. At first, they were just like me, a little copy of myself but with Fred's little freckles and a curious hair colour that looked like a mixture of brown and ginger. Fred chose their first names, some witchy references, and I chose their middle ones to honour both Tonks and Remus. However, those two were only similar to me in their physical appearance since they were an exact copy of Fred and George, much to their pride. When the girls were 2 years old, Fred and I thought that Cassie and Brina were more than enough but we had a little accident in which my period didn't arrive for 2 months and we genuinely thought I was pregnant again. Once we saw I wasn't, we found ourselves being quite disappointed, so after talking about it, we decided to have another baby and in December of 2003, Aidan Arthur Weasley-Lupin was born. I'll never forget how while I was giving birth, Fred couldn't separate from the doctor and as soon as he saw our boy's hair, he started to whoop all over the room — and the hospital! —, incredibly excited."A GINGER. HE'S A FUCKING GINGER, LET'S GO!"This time I chose his first name, choosing the name 'Aidan' that meant fire in Gaelic because of his ginger bright hair. He was a couple of months older than George's second kid, Jordan Johnson, named in honour of his godfather Lee.And while Fred thought he had made me another Weasley just like Brina and Cassie, my boy turned out looking exactly like Fred but having my personality."Shall we go to pick up our offspring before they destroy Angie's flat?" Fred joked, interlacing his hand with mine."Let's go, I bet Brina it's trying to set on fire Jordan's clothes.""She's an arsonist, just like her dad," Fred replied, proud.As we got out of the hospital together, as together as we had been for the past 19 years, we quickly distinguished our vehicle to drive us back home. I sat over my motorbike, turning it on and hearing that familiar growling coming from it that I loved so much. Putting on my leather jacket, I gave Fred a little smirk."Get on, handsome" I smiled at him, "We have some Weasley-Lupins to take to King's Cross."✵ ✵ ✵"Can we, please, make a row, for fuck's sake?" I asked, giggling as the entire Weasley family grouped together at the platform.Harry was saying the last goodbye to Ginny, ready to leave with James Sirius, Albus Severus —I know, I know, what a choice, — and Lily Luna back to Hogwarts, ready to occupy his place as Professor Potter, teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts.Hermione was fixing Rose's jacket while Ron was playing with Hugo, who still wasn't going to the magic school.I had my eyes on the number of children on the platform, trying to distinguish that familiar blue hair that promised to come today to say goodbye to his nieces and nephew, when two girls with Gryffindor robes started running around me.Was Liv sure when she said they didn't have ADHD? Because bloody hell, Merlin."Mum." "Mum.""Mum!" they said at the same time."Yes, girls?" I looked at them, crossing my arms and trying uselessly to hold back my smile as Fred approached us, curiously."You know what? We already have the first prank against Filch planned," Sabrina said, excited."We're gonna do it this week, just need a couple of days to have everything ready," Cassie giggled, with a mischievous bright in her eyes."Those are my girls," Fred said, proud, putting his arm over my shoulder."He's gonna catch you two one of these days!" I smiled, warning them, "Bet they already have their eyes on you.""Nah, 90% of the time they forget we are Weasleys," Cassandra giggled, clapping."Because we look just like you!" Sabrina added, excited, "Thanks, mum, for giving us this amazing genetic that makes us get away with our pranks, we love you!" she caught my hand and started kissing it while Cassie jumped into my arms to hug me, making me burst into giggles and Fred to snicker."Besides, normally is James Sirius the one being blamed for our pranks!" Cassie whispered."Oh, and you think that's okay? Making your cousin deal with the consequences of your acts?" I ironized, biting my inner cheek not to smile.They shrugged at the same time."I mean, that's his problem, not ours, who told him to be named after two Marauders?" said Brina while her twin nodded.I laughed again, watching Fred nod and wink at them in approval."Like father, like daughters.""As it should be," Freddie murmured arrogantly while high-fiving the girls."THAT'S MY GODDAUGHTER! YOO-HOO!" George came running, trapping Cassie into his arms and spinning her around making her giggle. Brina scowled, "UNCLE DRACO! THE WEASLEY CARROT IS STEALING MY TWIN!" Draco appeared accompanied by Astoria and little Scorpius, smiling at Sabrina."Aren't you a Weasley too, Bri?""But uncle Draco! You're my godfather, you're supposed to be on my side, duh! Besides the ginger here is Aidan. Bloody hell,  what a lucky one he is, since he's Professor Longbottom's godson he barely has to study for Herbology.""For fuck's sake, Brina, watch that bloody language," I huffed."That's what happens when you are the best Weasley-Lupin, Sabrina. Dad?" Aidan called Fred, making him instantly turn around to look at the mini version of himself. "Would you get mad if I tell you I almost broke Alex Alton's nose because he messed with mum?"Fred smirked and looked at me, "Like mother, like son,""As it should be," I imitated, winking at my boy who replied to me with a huge smile."No, mate, of course I won't get mad for that," Fred smiled at him."Good, because I still broke his nose," Aidan said, proud, putting his Slytherin tie around his neck. "Where's Jordan?""With auntie Angie. Hang on - didn't you say 'almost'?""Oops?" my boy shrugged, ironic."Hi, auntie Lilith," Scorpius spoke with his soft voice and good manners, dressed in the Slytherin robes and coming straight to hug me and to high-five Fred."Hello, my love. Ready to leave our house's name at the top? We need to show Brina, Cassie and Roxie which are the best ones here," I winked at him, making him nod and giggle as he ran to meet Albus Potter.Roxanne came running in front of us to meet my twins. They were the most inseparable trio at Hogwarts. "Look who we found outside of the platform snogging Victoire Weasley," Liv and Pauline appeared, showing us a blushed Teddy with messy hair and a little smirk on his face."AUNTIES!" all the kids burst, running at them and hugging them.Dear Merlin, our family was 

"Get off, she's my godmother!" Sabrina protested, trying to hug Liv."She's also my godmother, you idiot," Roxanne replied."Auntie Lin, has Maeve arrived at Beauxbatons?" Cassie asked.Pauline smiled at her. "Yes, chérie, she was so excited. Besides, Dominique and Louis will be there for her.""Wotcher, Lili!" Teddy approached me, immediately hugging me. I filled his cheeks with kisses, making him giggle.Even though I wasn't the one who gave birth to him, he would always be my first baby."Hello, my love! How's work doing?""Oh, great! Uncle Charlie and Professor Hagrid taught me so much that Luna Lovegood and Rolf Scamander barely had to ask me any question before letting me alone with the animals!""That's so cool, lad! We're so proud of you!" Fred said and Teddy jumped into his arms hugging him.Hermione approached me as she watched Rose getting on the train."God, when did our babies grow up so much?"I smiled and hugged her, "She's such a pretty girl and so smart. Just like her mum.""Lilith!" Hermione blushed, giggling."Are you still blushing because of me, Granger?" I scoffed, just to mess a little bit with her as usual. "After all these years?""Always," 'Mione winked at me."Lupin, that's my wife!" Ron protested, trying to hold back his smile."You two are on it again," Fred rolled his eyes, amused while crossing his arms making his shirt tighter. 39 years and he was still looking so bloody hot."We can't lose the habit, love.""Exactly.""GEORGE, PUT MY GIRLS ON THE FLOOR THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THE TRAIN!"They both came running excited and gave us one last hug."You go first, Cass," I told her, giving her one last kiss."But mum! I am Brina!" she protested, while her sister nodded in the back.I clicked my tongue while Fred giggled." Don't try to fool me, young lady. You two came out of me, I know exactly who is who.""Damn it," they both, smiled.We watched our kids getting on the train, waving at us and finally going to the school where everything started.Hogwarts. What a magical place, indeed.As we were going back home by walking, Fred and I couldn't help but think about how lucky we were for the life we had lived and we were living. We had managed to be the best parents we could, my kids knew Andromeda wasn't their actual grandmother, but they also knew my mother's topic was a difficult thing to discuss for me, so they respected and waited patiently until I had decided to tell them the truth. They could joke, have fun and all that, but they knew how to be serious when it was needed and they were able to communicate their emotions and feelings with immense maturity.I was incredibly proud of both them and me.Even if I could, I wouldn't change anything that happened in the past, because everything drove me here, to him, to them. My Freddie. My family.Once we got inside of the flat, which we had made bigger to fit our children's rooms, we finally rested, letting us fall over the couch."Merlin, I'm knackered," I whispered, resting my head on Fred's lap as he started caressing my hair."Well, now we have the entire flat for our own for the rest couple of months until Christmas," Fred whispered, giving me a smile. "Now we can rest and then... we can do lots of fun things.""By lots of fun things you mean fuck in every single corner of the flat?" I joked, looking at him.He arched one of his eyebrows, keeping his smile. "Exactly, until I have made you pregnant again.""Freddie, I have a tubal ligation and you got a vasectomy, we aren't having any more babies," I grinned at him.It didn't matter how many years had passed, the desire and magic between us never ceased, never got pleased. We didn't lie when we said we would never have enough from each other."Oh, but we can keep making the process, can't we, my love?" he teased me. "As much as you want, Freddie."I sat back again and pulled him closer to me to kiss him slow, intense and passionately, melting with him once again."I love you, Lilith," Fred whispered against my lips, putting his arms around my waist to pull me closer to him. "I'll never get tired of saying it.""I love you too, Freddie. I'll never get tired of loving you."Almost 20 years together and having a whole life ahead of us.If there was something that I had carved both in my heart and in my mind it was that Fred Weasley was my past, my present and my future.Fred Weasley was my home.And I was his.— ☽︎      𝐓   𝐇   𝐄         𝐄   𝐍   𝐃     ☾︎ —
