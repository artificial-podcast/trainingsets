    Hermione Granger couldn’t help it, she clapped a hand over her mouth and laughed. For a moment she couldn’t speak, she just stared at Theodore Nott as he strode into the room dressed as Cupid and took an elaborate bow. A one armed white satin toga hung artfully from his stocky, tattooed body, a pair of gold wings protruded from his back, and in his hand, he carried a golden bow, complete with a quiver full of arrows.  Hermione wasn’t the only one laughing. Pansy Parkinson was doubled over, shaking with silent mirth and Daphne Greengrass and Ginny Weasley were both giggling behind their hands. “Come on now girls, you’ve got to admit, it suits me.” “If anyone can pull it off it’s you, Theo,” Pansy confirmed with a grin.  Theo smirked, turning in a slow circle and lifting a lazy hand to acknowledge the wolf whistles Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini sent his way. “Gather round then ladies and gents, I have the power of the God of Love behind me now. I have within these very hands," he wiggled his fingers with a grin, "the power to pair you up for the Halloween Blind Date Contest.” Hermione watched incredulously as he took the arrows out of the quiver and held it out to the room at large. “If you are absolutely sure you want to commit to this event, please drop your name into this magical, uh, quiver thing.” One by one everyone in the room dropped a piece of parchment with their name on into the quiver. Theo theatrically waved his wand and whispered a rather complicated incantation. “Gather round then, boys and girls. Here we have the name of our first contender…” Theo prodded his wand into the quiver and a scrap of parchment floated up into the air. The parchment disappeared, leaving a name written in what appeared to be neon spell-light. “Neville Longbottom. Where are you, Neville?” Blushing furiously Neville stumbled forwards, adjusting his pirate costume as Theo pulled out his partner's name. “Pansy Parkinson.” Hermione gasped in shock, but Pansy grinned in apparent delight as she shimmied across to join Neville. Neville, it appeared, was completely thrown by her naughty witch’s costume and had no idea where to look. Theo continued pulling names out of the quiver. With another cheeky grin, he paired up Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, Ginny Weasley and Blaise Zabini, Ron Weasley and Milicent Bulstrode, and then stared with a wide grin at Hermione and Draco Malfoy, the only other remaining competitors in the room.   “Well, well well.” He gave them both what looked like a genuine smile, “look at that. Who would believe it?” Who would indeed? Hermione suppressed a roll of her eyes as she tried to arrange her face into something slightly friendlier than its current scowl. “Granger,” Malfoy said, smiling rather disconcertingly in his vampire costume and drawing attention to his magically pointed teeth. “You're looking very beautiful tonight.” “Thank you,” she replied with another rather forced smile as he took his place beside her. “What happens to you now then, Theo?” Draco asked. “Who becomes your partner?”  “I don’t have one. It’s my job to keep tabs on all of you and to direct the game. That’s why I get to wear these bad boys and you, Malfoy, are standing there dressed as a mere vampire.” Theo’s smirk was as wide as Hermione had ever seen it as he stroked his golden wings lovingly.  She wondered briefy how on earth she had let herself be talked into signing up for this, but she knew the answer. Ginny had been rather persuasive, and Hermione's curiosity had caused her to agree a little too easily. Hermione knew Ginny had signed up to the long-standing game played between Slytherin and Gryffindor hoping she would be paired with Blaise, and it looked like her wish had been granted. Hermione’s wish on the other hand….  “It hardly seems fair that you don’t have a partner though,” Pansy said, staring at Theo with a devious look on her face. “But oh dear, it looks like there is an odd number of us. Whatever could we do MIllie?” Millicent grinned, “Well, if this happens in class, usually the leftover person joins an existing pair. Thereby making a trio.” “Oh yes, that could work,” Pansy agreed. “But, oh. Oh dear, Millie, I only know of one other boy in this room who’s bi like Theo is....” Hermione watched Theo stare at the two girls with his expression caught somewhere between exasperation and humor. “Oh,” he said sarcastically, “I wonder who that could be?” He looked across the room and caught Draco’s eye. The blond was staring at Pansy with much the same expression as the one Theo wore. “What do you think, we can’t have you being on your own now can we?” Pansy continued innocently. “After all you’d be doing a good deed, you might be keeping these two from murdering each other. I know it’s Halloween, but we’re only meant to play with fake blood, not the real thing.” Hermione closed her eyes and breathed deeply. The only rules to the game that she knew of were that each pairing contained one player from each opposing house and that the pair had never dated before. To the best of her knowledge, there were no rules that forbade threesomes. Draco was watching her speculatively, as was Theo and she knew they were both waiting for her to back out. She looked up, smiling determinedly instead. “Come and join us then, Theo. I’m in if you two are?” Theo looked at both her and Draco then nodded. “You're on Granger. Let the games begin.” “Indeed!” Hermione said, then froze in alarm as someone hammered loudly on the door, “wait, I thought this room was supposed to be top secret?” “It is!” Harry said, frowning in confusion. “Unless the person outside knows what the room is being used for, and wants to enter it for the same purpose.” “Ah.” Theo strode to the door and pulled it open, his Cupid’s wings bouncing jauntily with every step he took. “Good evening ladies and gents” Hermione was amazed to see Seamus Finnigan blinking curiously on the other side of the threshold. Judging by his look of surprise it seemed that being enthusiastically confronted by a semi-naked Cupid was a little more than he had bargained for this evening. There were a couple of rather feminine giggles too, and Hermione shifted to see who else was outside. She stifled a gasp as the others came into view. Seamus was standing in front of a small group of other eighth years. Behind him were Dean Thomas, Lavender Brown, Cho Chang, Parvati Patil, Luna Lovegood, Hannah Abbott, and most surprisingly of all, Gregory Goyle. Just to compound the strangeness of the situation, they were all dressed in full Halloween regalia. Theo scratched his head making his dark hair stand up in a mess that could have rivaled Harry’s on a bad day. “Come in. Umm, do you all know what you're doing here?” “Of course!” Dean grinned. “We’re a little late because we had to make sure there was an even number of us, which was fine until we found Greg loitering outside the door here. Then we needed another girl, so we found Hannah and roped her in too!” Hannah blinked, looking a little bemused at everything that was going on. “Wait a sec,” Theo frowned. “This game is supposed to be Gryffindor vs Slytherin. You’re... wait, what houses are you all in?” “Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw,” Luna replied, smiling sweetly. “We know what the traditional rules of the game are, but we also thought this new eighth year was all about unity and building inter-house relationships, so we thought it might be okay to include the other two houses this year as well?” “I, umm, cannot argue with that at all. Wait though, there’s too many girls here now.” Theo said, eyeing the newcomers suspiciously.  Hermione gasped as Luna stepped confidently forwards. “No there’s not,” she said, gazing innocently into his blue eyes. "We talked about this as well, remember?" “Oooh!” Theo’s eyes lit up as his grin grew wider. “Yes we did. Are you sure about doing this?” “Honestly, there’s the right number of girls.” Seamus grinned. “Now, are you going to let us in to play or not?” “Names then. In here please,” Theo indicated the golden quiver with a grin. He passed out ready spelled parchment and quills and Hermione watched as all of the newcomers wrote their names down in the silence of the room then added them to the now glowing quiver. When it was full he prodded it's contents once more with his wand and again, names rose up into the air.  Hermione raised her eyebrows once more in surprise as Hannah Abbott was immediately paired with Gregory Goyle. Goyle smiled somewhat uncertainly as Hannah went to join him. Cho paired with Seamus, Parvati’s name linked her with Luna, “see Theodore, I told you there was the right number of ladies present,” Luna said with a faint smile as Pavarti blushed deeply, amid a chorus of wolf whistles and claps from the boys. Hermione wondered if Luna and Pavarti had realized that they would be outing themselves quite so publicly. From the look of sheer terror on Parvarti's face as Luna serenely took her hand, it would appear not. She also wondered how Luna and Theo seemed to know each other so well, but she pushed that small concern to one side then turned to look at the last unpaired couple in the room. Lavender and Dean stared at each other until Dean grinned, stuck his hand out, and smiled. “Come on then Lav, it looks like it’s you and me!” Theo glanced around, clearly delighting at still being center stage and having his captive audience grow significantly. He took another elaborate bow and waved his wand yet again. Hermione rolled her eyes at his theatrics as a blinding light flashed in the room. The light was followed a split second later by a loud bang and a puff of white smoke which faded to reveal two magical pieces of parchment which floated in midair in front of them all.  “The rules, ladies, and gents. You each wear one of these,” Theo conjured a stash of badges in the shape of thin golden arrows and placed them on the table beside him. “Keep your badge concealed at all times though. If any of the teachers notice the pin or catch you playing the game you are instantly disqualified. The badge records your progress. At the end of each day, progress points are added here,” Theo indicated the leader-board where each couple’s names glowed in neon writing, coloured according to their house allegiance.   “Points accumulate throughout the game. Treating your partner well gains you points. Being a dick drops your points. Cheating on your partner disqualifies you. Each week has a theme, with optional games that can win you extra points and the bottom couple is disqualified each week. The winning couple and house are announced after the New Years’ ball finishes. Any questions?” He looked around the room but nobody spoke. “This week’s theme is relationship chemistry and getting to know each other. You start scoring as soon as you put your pin in place- yes Hermione?” Hermione pulled her hand down out of the air with a frown. “You said the winning house? That seems a little unfair on Hufflepuff,” she glanced over at Hannah who giggled nervously beside Greg, “Ravenclaw too.” “Last year those houses weren’t even in the game Granger. This year at least they have a fighting chance,” Theo said. Hermione frowned as Draco sniggered irritatingly beside her. She was starting to seriously regret her decision to take part in this game, especially given who her partners were set to be. She sighed and adjusted her wig, suddenly dressing up as Belle from Beauty and the Beast seemed like a ridiculous idea too. Ginny, it seemed, had a lot to answer for.   Nobody else was objecting to the unfair house representation in the slightest. She glanced around the room at her friends who were smiling and laughing with each other and their new partners. then she turned back to see Draco watching her in amusement. “You’re looking a little put out, Granger. Whatever could be wrong?” She scowled even harder as Theo hovered in front of them both with two pins in his hand and a broad smile on his face. “Hello, my very favorite couple in the room. Shall I fix your pins for you both?” Draco chuckled as Theo purposely dropped one pin then bent down to pick it up. He bumped his Cupid wings purposely into Draco as he turned, laughing as one wing stroked up Draco’s thigh and caught in his Dracula cloak. “Whoops a daisy,” Theo smiled as he used the opportunity to brush a hand over Draco’s crotch under the pretence of pulling the wing free. Draco merely rolled his eyes as Theo magically fixed the pin to the inside of his robes, then moved on to attach Hermione’s. “Draco’s not too bad when you get to know him, Hermione. Give him a chance, you never know, you might find you quite like being sandwiched in between two fallen angels.” Theo grinned again at her sharp intake of breath and sauntered away, leaving her gazing open-mouthed after him. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” Theo called loudly, “the game begins….. Now!!”
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    Harry and Daphne wandered over to join Hermione and Draco. Hermione gave a little squeak of surprise as Harry pulled the well worn Marauder’s Map out of his pocket, tapped it with his wand then muttered, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” The map emerged on the page as it always did, but as well as the usual outline of Hogwarts and the hundreds of tiny labelled dots, several messages appeared as well.  Hermione’s jaw dropped as the writing gradually solidified. 
  
  

  Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would like to offer their sincerest congratulations on your decision to continue our rather epic Halloween contest.
 
  Mr. Moony would like to offer his congratulations on your decision to improve inter-house unity and relations.
 
  Mr. Padfoot would like to offer the following heartfelt advice. “Stick it to the Slytherins.” 
 
  Mr. Wormtail would like to offer his all-round support and encouragement.
 
  Mr. Prongs would like to acknowledge the very beautiful dress you’re blind date is wearing, Harry, and to tell you that he wholeheartedly approves of your pairing.

  
  
Draco frowned, shifting beside Hermione to stare at the map in horror. “Uh, Potter, what the actual fuck?” Harry just grinned. “Oh, this is the map I told you about, Malfoy. As head of the Gryffindor team, I feel we should have a way of keeping our participants safe as they leave this room. It would never do for a teacher to spot them and let’s say, intervene in the game, would it now?” “Potter, I am head of the Slytherin team and this,” he indicated the map, “stick it to the Slytherins? This is just plain rude. I feel your map is biased. Also, I don’t have a map. I hope you’re not intending to use this to gain the upper hand for your team.” Harry grinned. “So suspicious, Malfoy. And yeah, the map might well be biased. A little bit anyway. I’m not keeping it to myself though, we can all use it to get out of here safely. Look, Professor Sprout is patrolling along here,” Draco squinted at the map as Harry pointed to the tiny labelled dot bearing the name Pomona Sprout, and saw for himself that she was indeed walking perilously close to the Room of Requirement. “Fine,” Draco said crossly, obviously not catching onto anything else the map had revealed. Hermione looked at Harry with wide-eyes as Draco turned away to speak to Daphne.  “Did you know they invented this game?” she hissed, trying and failing to keep the shocked disapproval out of her voice. Harry shook his head. “Nope, I never had a clue. It doesn’t really surprise me though, does it you?” She huffed, feeling even more disconcerted about the whole game now that she knew who was behind it. “I am so going to have words with Sirius and Remus about this! it’s, it’s...” “Exactly the sort of thing they would do!” Ron said, peering over Harry’s shoulder. “This is brilliant! Oh, bloody hell…. Harry, you don’t reckon, what if they invented this game, played it, and, and your Mum and Dad got paired up? What if that was how they got together? Sirius and Remus could have paired up for it too!” Harry looked as if he had been hit over the head by a bludger. He blinked at Daphne who was still deep in conversation about vampire fangs with Draco and his eyes widened in shock. The blood drained from his face as he swayed slightly on the spot. Sirius had always told him that his parents had gotten together during their eighth year at Hogwarts…. “Harry mate, can we leave the room yet?” Theo asked, waving his hand in front of Harry’s glazed-over eyes.  “Wha? Oh, uh-” Harry said, checking the map again. “Yes but turn left not right, and use the far stairs, not the first set.” Theo turned to Hermione who was also still reeling from the map's revelations. “Would you care to accompany me, my lady?” He grinned at Draco, “you can come along too if you like, I’ve never adhered to the notion that three’s a crowd!”
  
  
  

  
  
Walking into the Great Hall dressed as a Disney Princess with Draco Malfoy on one arm and Theo Nott on the other was not the way Hermione had envisioned this Halloween evening playing out. She had passed her charmed arrow pin over the magical sensor in the Room of Requirement and been swept from the room before her brain had properly caught up with her feet. She hadn’t fully processed the fact that they were playing a Marauder’s game either, but now that she thought about it, it all made rather a lot of sense.  Draco and Theo had chatted easily all the way down to the hall, leaving Hermione to ponder her situation in silence. She was feeling very conflicted about the whole contest. She had agreed to join mostly to cheer Ginny up, since splitting up with Harry, Ginny had spent an awful lot of time staring into space and fantasizing about Blaise Zabini, on whom she had developed a rather sudden and intense crush. For someone who hated to fly, Hermione was suddenly spending a lot of time on the quidditch pitch waiting for the Slytherin team to finish their training sessions. Ginny had heard about the Cupid contest in the Gryffindor common room and had sweet-talked Harry, who was the Gryffindor team leader, into letting her take part, despite her being in the year below everyone else.  Ginny had then turned her blue eyes pleadingly to Hermione, and Hermione had agreed to play without giving too much thought as to who she might be paired with. Hermione knew the game was firmly against school rules, and that really she should be reporting such goings-on rather than taking part in them. The mere idea of going against the teachers left her conflicted and now she had found out that the game had been invented partly by Sirius and Remus, she was even less convinced that she was doing the right thing by being involved. She sighed quietly as she looked at the two boys beside her. Everyone else seemed to think that her drawn pairing was hilarious but she was… well, what was she? She was cross, she realized. Cross and put out. How dare this stupid game pair her with her arch enemy and how dare Theo just waltz in and join them as if it was the most natural thing in the world? And how dare this whole bloody game be devised by Harry’s godfather and his best friends?! “Granger?” Theo was waving at her again, “I thought you always paid attention? You’re like a space cadet tonight!” “What?” she blinked, startled as Theo grinned. They had stopped in front of a table bearing pitchers of different colored fruit punches. “Blue, purple or red?” “I’m sorry what?” Draco huffed in exasperation. “Brightest witch of our age be dammed. Granger! Which color punch would you like?”  “Oh! Purple please.”  “Would you like a little... addition?” Draco pulled a small flask out of his Dracula robes and added a generous splash of amber liquid to his and Theo’s drinks.  Hermione blinked again, “would you excuse me for a moment please?” she said, and without waiting for an answer she spun on her heel then stomped away, keen to leave the hall to have a moment by herself before she exploded in a fit of frustration. She didn’t get very far, however, before she felt the familiar pull of a slowing hex around her middle and she stopped, closing her eyes, counting to ten while praying for patience as she turned around to face Ron. “What?!” she snapped, glaring up at him with such ferocity that Millicent backed away. Ron just grinned cheerfully in the face of her fury. “What’s up with you?” “Nothing.” “‘Mione, in about twelve seconds time you’ll be stomping your feet in temper and my charms are not up to repairing snapped high heels. So, you can either storm off to the bathroom to get upset thereby causing a major scene, or you can tell me what’s wrong.  I know you too well, you can't hide it from me.” Ron passed her a glass of purple punch, knowing her preference without needing to ask, and she took it as she sighed heavily. “Thank you. It’s,” she waved her arm in the general direction of the Great Hall and closed her eyes, breathing deeply through her nose then letting it out in a sigh. Ron’s easy familiarity was calming her. He was right, she couldn’t hide anything from him or Harry. This wasn’t worth having a complete meltdown over either. She had faced worse and survived, after all. “I doubt you’re offended by the entire hall so, I’ll hazard a guess. Is it being paired with Malfoy that's upsetting you?”  She nodded. “Yes! And the whole Marauders thing. And they just offered me Firewhisky out of a flask. And I’m sounding ridiculous now aren’t I?” A braver man would have backed away, or placated her with a pat on the arm, her temper was legendary after all, but Ron simply grinned at her while fishing a flask out of his own pocket. “Yes. You are," he said, glancing around to check for teachers, "Firewhisky?” She stared at him for a long moment as Millicent shifted uneasily from foot to foot. Hermione closed her eyes, letting out another long, troubled sigh. “That’s better,” Ron added a generous measure to her drink and she arranged her features into something that better resembled a smile. “Now, give me a hug because it’s really fun seeing Malfoy looking so irritated.” She laughed as she hugged him briefly then let him go, feeling much happier than she had a few minutes previously. “Now. Before either of your new partners starts sending curses my way, bugger off back to them.” Hermione glanced over to where she had left the boys. Both Draco and Theo were watching her closely. Theo looked amused but Draco looked, Merlin, he looked ready to lay Ron out. Millicent offered her a hesitant smile as Hermione looked back at her and Ron. “He’s not as bad as you think he is.” She touched Hermione’s arm and Hermione, remembering a rather painful headlock experience a few years prior tried very hard not to flinch. “The war changed a lot of people, give him a chance. And if he gets too cocky, you could always just punch him.” That did it, Hermione's tension finally broke as she laughed and squeezed Millicent’s hand in return. “Thank you. I needed to hear that.”   Mentally pulling herself together again, she plastered a smile onto her face and rejoined Theo and Draco. Theo put his bow and arrow down then held out a hand which she took, giggling despite herself, as he brought it to his lips to kiss. Now that her temper had calmed she took a proper look at them both and her forced smile turned into a real, and rather appreciative one. Even though he seemed to be wearing a dress, Theo looked amazing. He was probably one of the few people in the entire school who could pull this particular look off so confidently.  Then there was Draco. Dressing as a vampire somehow enhanced his brooding good looks and added an extra element of intrigue to his already well-honed bad boy image. His hair was shining milky white under the multicolored lights, and his height and stature were nothing short of intimidating… unintentionally she took a rather large gulp of her drink then locked eyes with him as she caught her bottom lip between her teeth. She blushed as he offered her the merest quirk of an eyebrow raise. “Would I not have been your first choice of partner for this event then Hermione?” She sucked in a small breath at the way he said her name. They were on talking terms now, of course, all of the returning eighth years were. Draco had offered her a full and honest apology for the way he had treated her in her former years, and she had accepted it. That didn’t mean she liked him though, they had done no more than exchange pleasantries since the start of term so while his apology had been most welcome, her opinion of him had yet to change. “Would I have been yours?” She expected him to answer awkwardly or to be noncommittal, she certainly wasn’t ready for him to look her directly in the eye and smile. “Yes,” he said. “There was no one else I would have wanted to partner with.” “Oh!” she said, as Theo clutched his heart while pretending to faint in mock despair, “I see.” “So,” Draco continued, his stormy grey eyes boring into hers as she stared, held captive and unable to look away, “If I would have chosen you, and you wouldn’t have chosen me, I suppose that leaves me with a job to do.” “And what would that job that be?” Hermione asked as Theo smirked knowingly beside them. “Making you change your mind.” Hermione swallowed weakly as she finished her drink, only for Theo to present her with a refill, this one with a measure of Firewhisky strong enough to make her eyes water.  As the evening progressed the three of them talked surprisingly easily. Theo proved to be the perfect buffer to any awkward moments that arose, and Hermione found that she was thoroughly enjoying the time she spent with the two of them. Two hours later she tried to put down her glass, feeling decidedly tipsy and wondering where the time had gone. “But you two, thank you, Theo,” he took the glass from her with a chuckle and put it on the table that she had missed, “I didn’t know about you two being..…” she gestured with her fingers, “do you? I mean, are you together?” “When we feel like it.” Draco tilted his head to the side slightly, assessing her response. “But we’re not official. Or exclusive. You see,” he leaned forwards in his chair and picked up her hand, holding it in his and drawing little circles on her palm with his finger, “we both like girls too.” “Oh.” The air in the room seemed to be disappearing. Had his eyes always been so dark? Had his voice always been so deep and seductive?” “One girl, in particular, caught our eye,” Theo said from the side and Hermione turned, dragging her eyes away from Draco’s only to lose herself in Theo’s cerulean blue gaze. “A while ago actually.” “Did she?” Her breathing was a little shaky as Theo nodded and Draco released her hand. She used it to run her fingers nervously through her hair, absently playing with a curl.  “She did,” Theo confirmed. He looked down as his arrow badge glowed, “Excuse me a moment, it seems I have something to attend to. I’ll be right back.”  “Dance?” Draco asked, offering his arm, and she accepted rather hesitantly, taking his hand and following him to the dance floor. Several other students were already dancing in couples, a few of whom Hermione recognized as new pairings from tonight's contest, and a mixture of students from the other years were dancing enthusiastically in big groups. Ginny flashed her a triumphant grin as she passed by wrapped up in Blaise’s arms, Pavarti and Luna were giggling as Luna tried to teach Pavarti some new dance steps, Hannah was dancing contentedly with Greg, and Hermione smiled, pleased to see her friends looking so happy. Maybe this mad contest wasn’t such a bad idea after all.  Draco took both of her hands and guided them into the right position as she broke out of her daydream. He took the lead, waltzing her competently around the floor. He had obviously had dance lessons, although that was no great surprise given his upbringing, but he somehow managed to make her feel as if she knew what she was doing with classical dancing too. Despite her lack of sobriety she only stepped on his toes twice, and both times he just smiled instead of making the cutting remark she had been expecting. Maybe he had changed. When the music switched to a slower number he gave up the formal dancing and pulled her closer into his arms. “Is this alright Hermione or am I overstepping?” His voice was a low purr in her ear and an hour or so ago she would have felt decidedly uncomfortable with that. Now though, and she wasn't sure if she had just relaxed in his company or had consumed too much of the Firewhisky spiked punch, but now it was most definitely okay. Especially when… oh Gods…. especially when Theo stepped up behind her, sandwiching her firmly between the pair of them just as he had promised to do earlier. “It’s fine,” she breathed, feeling a sudden pull of arousal that threatened to make her knees give way, “You’re not overstepping.” “See,” Theo’s hands were on her waist as he pulled her gently back into him. “I said you might like this didn’t I?” Speechlessly Hermione nodded, a tiny whimper catching at the back of her throat as Theo pressed her forwards into Draco again, and both of them ground against her at the same time, then pulled back slightly, leaving her panting and suddenly bereft.  Theo chuckled at her affected look. “You. Are. Beautiful. But, I’m told I can be pushy so if this is too much for you then tell me and I’ll back it up a bit.” “Umm, no, actually. That was just fine. Don’t.” “Don’t what?” “Don’t back up.” “What about me?” Draco spun her around gently to face the other way, bumped his very obvious arousal into her bottom then turned her to face him once more. “Do I need to back up or am I fine too?”  “You’re fine too.” Merlin, what on earth was she saying tonight? Draco smiled, not his usual, infuriating smirk but a real smile, and lowered his head, gazing into her eyes as he brought his lips closer to her own. She lifted her chin as his lips brushed hers, gently, delicately, and then firmly as he pulled her into him. He moved his hands from her hips up to her face, cupping her jaw and then sliding around to sink his fingers gently into her hair. She outright whimpered at that, pressing forwards into him then lifting her own hands to circle them around his neck. When they finally pulled apart Draco looked just as shell shocked as she felt. Theo had stepped back to watch them with a smile and he reached for her hand as she ran her other fingers over her kiss swollen lips, still tasting Draco there. “So, is this it then?” she asked, “You two and me, we’re doing this contest as a threesome?” “Triad,” Theo corrected.  “Triad.” She mirrored weakly as the need to test them both formed in her mind. “Well, shouldn’t we all have a first kiss then? That means you two as well?” She still couldn't quite believe that they were together, for some reason her brain was struggling to come to terms with the idea. It wasn’t that she had a problem with two men in a physical relationship because she most certainly didn’t. She practically lived with Sirius and Remus for Merlin’s sake, and they were openly affectionate with each other, but something inside her just couldn’t compute the idea of Draco and Theo together. She needed proof that this wasn’t some kind of elaborate trick that they were playing on her.  “You're forgetting something, beautiful,” Draco said quietly. “It won’t be mine and Theo’s first kiss will it? We’ve kissed, and done a whole lot more than that before now. Many times.” “Not in front of me you haven’t.” They looked at each other, clearly amused at her bravado. “She’s got a point,” Theo’s grin was wicked as he smoothly pinned her back in between them both. Wondering what he was going to do she gasped as he reached for Draco and the pair of them came together to kiss over her shoulder. They moved closer simultaneously and she struggled to breathe as pure unadulterated desire flooded through her.  They kissed as if they knew each other well, Theo was in charge and Draco clearly knew it. Their mouths were slightly open, showing her every last detail as they tasted each other and melded their tongues together. The obvious affection between them was easy and she could feel they were both affected, Draco’s rock hard erection pushed into her stomach while Theo’s bumped against her back. When they finally pulled apart Theo turned to her and she gasped as he immediately captured her lips, pulling her into him and demanding her submission, just as he had done to Draco. She happily let him claim her, wondering how she would manage to stay standing when they both let her go. Draco bent his head to kiss her neck, nipping with his teeth then flicking his tongue over the same spot to ease the sting. Hermione gasped, the feeling of them both kissing her at the same time was overwhelming, and she was very glad that they were in such a dark secluded corner.  When they finally pulled away she felt distinctly unsteady on her feet. “How was that then, beautiful?” Theo asked with a cheeky grin, “are you still regretting your game pairings?” I think,” she said, carefully, her head still swimming, “I think I’ve changed my mind. I seem to be quite happy with the choice now.” 
  
    Chapter Text
    “Remus!” Hermione called as she stepped out of the floo in Grimmauld Place, “oh! You’re both here already!” She straightened up, staring at Harry and Ron as she brushed the soot from her clothes, wincing as her pounding head protested at the sudden movements and her stomach lurched horribly from the spinning of the floo.  “Steady there Kitten,” Sirius grinned as he jumped up to greet her then stopped short, “are you alright, you look a bit pale.” “She’s hungover.” Harry fixed her with a knowing grin, “that’s my guess anyway.” “Ah.” Sirius nodded wisely, then frowned. “I thought Hermione didn’t drink?” “I don’t.” She took a deep breath then sat down rather heavily in the nearest chair. “Usually.” “Therein lies the problem apparently.” Sirius opened a cupboard and fished out a vial of potion. “Good night, was it?” Hermione blushed, wondering how much Ron and Harry had already said. “Take this.” “What is it?” she asked, staring suspiciously at the innocent looking vial.  “Morning,” Remus smiled as he wandered into the kitchen. “Nice to see you all. What’s wrong Hermione?” “This is all your fault,” she said ferociously, pointing at Remus and then Sirius. “Both of you.” “Really?” Sirius looked skeptical as he laughed and pushed the vial into her hands. “Drink it, Kitten. You’ll feel better.”  “You haven't told me what it is, if you think I’m just going to-” “That’s hangover potion. Have you not taken it before?” Remus asked, smiling kindly, taking the vial out of Sirius’ hand and uncorking it for her as she shook her head. “It tastes cool and minty, it will help if you’re feeling a bit worse for wear.” “Well why didn’t you say so?” she glared at Sirius who was still laughing at her bad mood. He pushed his hair out of his eyes and put a pan on the stove, then started to add bacon while Ron got the bread out of the cupboard and Remus put the kettle on. Hermione sniffed the vial carefully, noting the two empty ones already on the table. “Have you taken this already?” she asked Harry, “Yes, come on ‘Mione, it will honestly help. How much did you have to drink last night?”  “I don’t really know," she admitted, trying to remember. “A few. But Theo’s measures were rather generous and I don’t normally-” “Drink,” Sirius finished for her, practically stuffing the vial into her mouth as Remus put a cup of strong coffee in front of her. She winced as she swallowed the potion then almost immediately began to feel better. Sirius put the empty vial with the others on the table and fixed his grey eyes on her. “So, what exactly is our fault, Kitten? Please enlighten me, if I’m being blamed for something I’d love to know what I’ve done.” “I would imagine Harry’s told you about the game already?”  Sirius smiled. “Ah yes. He has mentioned it. I’m glad it's still going strong. And since you're here and I already know you're playing it, why don't you tell us who your partner is?”  Hermione was surprised the boys hadn’t already filled him in, but it would appear they’d kept quiet. Sirius’s eyes grew huge as she confessed. Remus turned away from the stove in concern, “I didn’t realize the game allowed triads.” Sirius shrugged, “there's no reason it shouldn’t, is there Moony? We made it to be fairly broadminded after all.” “Yes,” Remus smiled, “I suppose we did, but Hermione, I’d be a little concerned about you being partnered with either of those two, but I'm especially unsure of the pair of them together. How are they treating you?”  Hermione couldn’t help it, a deep blush bloomed brightly across her cheeks, down her neck, and across her chest. Harry gasped, “You didn’t?” “No!” she exclaimed, “of course not!” Sirius was watching her with a broad grin as he passed Remus some eggs. Remus took the eggs then batted his hands away, clearly knowing better than to let Sirius be involved in any cooking. “We, umm, might have kissed though.” “Why are you blushing so hard if all you did was kiss? And, more to the point which one did you kiss?” Ron turned away from the toaster as the floo roared into life and discharged Ginny into the kitchen. Ginny held up a hand at their greetings, marched straight to the cupboard, downed a hangover potion, then flopped dramatically into a chair at the table. “Oh Gods,” Ron turned away, making a disgusted face at the sight of the purple love-bite on her neck. “Glamour that Gin, and tell him you bruise easily, I can’t look at my baby sister with that monstrosity-” Ginny frowned, then following Ron’s gaze ran her fingers over her neck with a wince. “Oh!”  “Good morning, Red.” Sirius smiled as he handed her a mug of coffee and Remus added more bacon to the pan. “Is anyone else coming or are we done?” “Neville might, but I think that’s it.” Ginny sighed dramatically as she leaned forwards in her chair. “Right. Miss G, spill the beans. I saw you three kissing in the corner last night, what the hell happened after that ?”  Hermione sipped her coffee as yet again the floo roared and Neville stepped out, causing Sirius to mutter something along the lines of collecting waifs and strays and needing to start charging for cooked breakfasts. “Nothing much,” Hermione turned to Ginny hoping for a private conversation but realizing that every ear in the room was trained on her. “Nothing much?!” Ginny shrieked, “I saw you wedged between the second two hottest boys in school and then snogging both of them. ‘Mione, I nearly combusted just watching. You can’t tell me nothing happened after that?!” Hermione grimaced. “Why are they only the second hottest boys?” she asked as her brain caught up with Ginny's words. “I take it you think you've got the hottest one then?” “No question!” Ginny grinned like the cat that had stolen the cream. “Four A.M. I got back to Gryffindor Tower, and I could hardly walk when I got up this morn-” Both Harry and Ron stuck their fingers in their ears, Neville gave a horrified yelp and Ron started humming loudly. “Sounds like an excellent night.” Sirius started handing out plates of bacon and scrambled eggs on toast. Hermione clapped her hand over her mouth as she giggled. “Here,” Sirius threw Ginny a tub of cream, “Your brother’s going to turn green in a moment. “Cover that damn bruise, you can wash the cream off later if you want to keep the mark.”  Hermione's eyes widened at the look he exchanged with Remus as he said that. Ginny turned a wicked smile on him, “Speaking from experience here are you?”  “Of course,” Sirius said without a trace of embarrassment as he put her breakfast in front of her. “What's the first week’s theme then?”  “As if you didn’t know!” Harry said around a mouthful of toast. “It’s relationship building and chemistry.” Remus nodded. “How are all of yours so far?” “Amazing!” Ginny answered first, “Surprisingly good,” Hermione said with a smile. “Awful,” Neville admitted,  “Not so great either,” Harry agreed. “Good. Actually.” Ron finally removed his fingers from his ears and chanced a look at Ginny now that Hermione had finished applying the cream to the offending area.  “Harry and I want to switch partners,” Neville said. “We spent the evening as a foursome, and the pairings are most definitely round the wrong way.” “How very annoying.” Remus nodded, trying to hide his amusement.  “Do we uh, get any leeway to switch?” Harry asked hopefully.  “Nope. Cupid pairs you up and that’s it I’m afraid. I would know, I was the original Cupid.” “Of course you were.” Hermione laughed. Sirius and Theo, she decided, were cut from the same cloth. She could just see Sirius wearing that ridiculous costume and pulling it off with as much style as Theo had managed last night.  “Although,” Remus turned, gesturing with the spatula as he fixed Harry and Neville with his twinkling eyes, “there’s always fetish week if you get that far of course. You could say your fetish was partner swapping, that might be allowed.” Harry and Neville looked uncomfortably at each other as Ginny burst out laughing. “These two?! Fetish week?! Ahem. Sorry,” she said, feigning contrition as she filled her mouth with bacon and continued to smirk. “I think we’ll both be out by then,” Harry said. “We're joint bottom of the leaderboard as it is.” “Who’s top?” Hermione couldn’t help but ask.  Ron sighed in a long-suffering way. “That would be Gin and Blaise. Tied with Luna and Parvarti. Your third ‘Mione. Mind You I’m fifth, surprisingly enough. But it's very early on so there’s plenty of time for it all to change.”
  
  
  
  Hermione floo’d back into Hogwarts a couple of hours later feeling decidedly less hungover but still a little unsettled. The eighth year common room was almost empty. She looked past Hannah who was studying at a table with Luna and the Patil twins, into a pair of startling grey eyes. Draco was sitting at a table on his own, his study notes piled neatly beside him as he paused in writing his essay. His smile was slow as he took her in, but it was genuine, without any hint of a smirk and, Merlin help her, it suited him. “Hey,” he said lightly, and she couldn’t help but smile back despite another rather obvious blush. “I was getting a bit concerned about you,” he said, inviting her to sit with him, “No one had seen you since last night, I was rather hoping we didn’t scare you off?” “No,” she laughed. “It was nothing like that, although I admit I was feeling a little poorly this morning. I went to Grimmau- Harry’s Godfather’s house for breakfast.” She glanced at the clock, “or lunch, whichever meal that just counted as.” Draco nodded as he ran his fingers through his hair. He was fresh from the shower and he smelled clean, of pine needles, spearmint, and just a hint of citrus. She breathed in as she sat down, trying not to be too obvious about ogling him. His clothing didn’t help, muggle jeans teamed with a simple black hoodie, how had she never noticed how attractive he was in the past?  “Are you feeling better now?” Her mouth was dry as she stared at him, trying to jog her brain out of its blinding attraction to make sense of his words. “Yes thank you. Much.” Draco smiled, “Theo is known for being rather heavy-handed with the drinks. You’ll get used to it. And if you don’t I can brew a good hangover cure.” She caught her bottom lip between her teeth and smiled, he sounded awfully confident, but then he always was, wasn’t he? His eyes were darkening as they lingered on her mouth. “Harry’s Godfather Sirius Black?” Hermione nodded as Draco put his quill down then leaned back in his chair. “What I’ve gathered from Neville Longbottom, of all people, is that Black had something to do with making this game and that infernal map that Harry had last night. Is that right?” Hermione nodded and gave him a brief rundown of the basics. This time he did smirk, managing to combine it with a raised brow that made him look highly amused, “well the family connection’s clearly not giving Potter an edge, he’s bottom of the leaderboard at the moment. He and Daph are not a good match apparently.” “No,” Hermione agreed, looking up as the others returned through the floo from Grimmauld. The noise level increased significantly as the main door also opened and a few more people trooped back inside.  Draco snapped his book shut and smiled brightly at her. “We, on the other hand, are doing very well indeed. Fancy going for a walk into Hogsmeade?” Hermione stared at him trying to read his intentions. She was still wary of him and his motives, despite their high ranking on the leaderboard, but he seemed genuinely interested in spending time with her. Whether that was purely because of the game or not she wasn’t sure, but she supposed that at this stage it didn’t really matter. She nodded. “Alright, shall we invite Theo too? In fact, where is he?” Draco frowned, “he said he was going to the library but I find that hard to believe. We can find him on the way I know a few places he's more likely to be, go grab a coat and meet me back here in five.” Hermione nodded, hurrying off to find some warmer clothes with butterflies in her stomach and a smile on her lips. 
  
  
  

  
  
 It turned out that the fresh air was exactly what she needed to blow away the last remnants of her hangover. She tipped her face up to the sky, enjoying the late autumn sunshine. Gusts of wind blew flurries of leaves from the trees and they danced on the breeze as they fell then raced along the ground as if chasing each other for fun. Hermione spun around watching more blow down through the trees. “What are you thinking?” Theo asked, pulling his coat closed as he watching her with a smile. “Just how very different things are now compared with two years ago,” she admitted.  “Ah. Yes. Just a bit,” Theo agreed, turning with her to watch the leaves. Two years ago Hermione had been hiding out with Harry and Ron, trying to figure out how to defeat Voldemort, and Theo and Draco, well she knew it hadn’t been a happy time for them either.  Following the Battle of Hogwarts, the school had closed for a year so that the teachers could focus on rebuilding the castle, filling the empty teaching posts, and building a new, more modern curriculum. The sabbatical year had also given those who were injured or traumatized time to heal and get the treatment they needed. The enforced and subsequently delayed eighth year had seemed rather restrictive when it was first announced, especially given their current age and the life experiences they had all gained, but Minerva McGonagall had held firm. The returning students would be given extra age related concessions, but education was important. Nobody had achieved NEWT results that reflected their true abilities, the new headmistress refused to see their lives or potential careers curtailed any more than was absolutely necessary.  “Are you two planning on walking backwards all the way to Hogsmeade?” Draco asked in amusement.  “Nope.” Theo scooped up a handful of leaves and scattered them all over Draco, “I’m planning on doing this instead!” Draco growled, low in his throat, then stooped to grab a handful of his own in retaliation. Hermione shrieked as the wind caught the pile and it scattered, covering them all in tiny, fragile pieces of decaying leaf. She tried to glare at Draco but his cheeky wink seemed so out of character that it caused her to laugh instead. She ran her fingers through her curls trying to shake the leaves out. Was he always like this now he was free of Voldemort’s shadow? she wondered, because if so, it suited him.  When they finally reached Hogsmeade Hermione suppressed a shiver. It wasn’t that she had been avoiding the town exactly, just that the last time she had been here it had looked very different to the way it did now. Her last visit had been with Harry and Ron, the night they’d set off the caterwauling charm that had led to them diving into the Hog’s Head, then going down the tunnel into Hogwarts, and the entire chain of events that had followed….  She snapped back to reality as Theo led them both along the street and into the crowded heat of Zonko’s joke shop. “I need some supplies for next weekend,” he said rather mysteriously as Draco nodded and steered Hermione back towards the front door looking distinctly uncomfortable.  “Meet you back outside,” Draco said, as he and Theo exchanged a look that seemed to convey an entire private conversation. It obviously made sense to both of them, but it left Hermione blinking in confusion.  “What’s wrong?” she asked. Draco’s whole demeanor had changed and he stepped back outside looking shaken, all trace of his earlier playfulness gone and the sullen, moody look he had worn throughout their school days back in place.  He took a couple of deep breaths before he said anything. “The shopkeeper knows me,” he admitted vaguely, making Hermione frown in confusion.  “He knows me too,” she said, not following his train of thought. "We're not on first name terms but we certainly know each other by sight." “Yes Granger, that’s the problem. Everyone knows you. And I mean this in the nicest possible way, they know you as one of the good people. One-third of the Golden Trio, the Golden Girl. You being seen out and about with me or Theo is going to do you no favors at all. I should have thought this through more.” Hermione goggled at him for a moment, then realized that he was serious. “You, you're worried about my-? What, my image? my reputation? Good grief!” “Don’t play dumb Hermione it doesn’t suit you.” His eyes were narrow and his voice was cold once more. She shivered, not liking this new self-deprecating tone at all. “They know you, they know me. We both have a reputation, as they say. I don’t want to tarnish yours with mine.” She huffed. Clearly, Draco didn’t understand her particularly well yet. She didn’t know whether to be flattered by his worry, sad that he still felt he was being judged for crimes that were not altogether his fault, or furious that he thought she would be swayed by public opinion. “Draco, I don’t care who I’m seen with! If I choose to spend time with you, or Theo, or whoever, that’s my choice and other people can go to hell with their judgemental-” “Yes, yes," he said, cutting off her furious tirade. “All very admirable sentiments but you're a bright girl Granger, you know people will talk. I didn’t think it through when I invited you down here. I don’t want to make life difficult for you.” “Oh, because my life has been so easy so far you mean?” She couldn’t help the corners of her mouth tugging up into a smirk that almost, almost could have matched one of his own. Feeling slightly reckless and spurred on by his sudden show of altruism she noticed a large group of students walking down the hill. Sizing him up she narrowed her eyes. “Can I kiss you?” “What?” he looked amazed, “of course you can, you can kiss me anytime you like but-” she silenced him by stretching up on tiptoes and locking her lips to his. Their first kiss may have only happened last night but it appeared that she had already forgotten how good he tasted and how perfectly his lips fitted against hers because the next second she was pressing closer to him while whimpering softly into his mouth in an entirely unexpected way.  He responded with a low, feral noise, spun her around, and backed her up against the shop wall. He nudged his thigh between her legs and brought it up to press against her core making her gasp, the passion between them burned blindingly and came from absolutely nowhere. A chorus of wolf whistles split the quiet afternoon and she pulled back, giving him a wink on the way. “There. There were going to be rumors anyway, this gets it all out in the open and it will be over and done with sooner. And, just in case you thought I wasn’t happy to be seen with you in public, I hope I’ve proved my point.”  “You certainly did that!” Theo grinned, letting the shop door close with a tinkle, “All I want to know is where’s my kiss? I’m a bit worried about being seen in public too. I’m very shy and-”  “Shy?” she stared at him in amusement as he grinned. “What did you buy?” she asked, looking curiously at the bulging bag. “Supplies for next week’s theme.” He twitched the bag away as she made to peek inside. “Uh-huh, top secret I'm afraid.” Draco sighed dramatically and Hermione paused as they passed the Three Broomsticks, “seriously, what’s the point of shagging Cupid if we don’t get any inside intel?” he asked with a wink and Hermione laughed, glad to see him cheering up again. “I thought you said we were going in here?”  Theo shook his head, “we said the pub. We didn't specify which one. Draco’s banned from this one.” “Wh- Oh.” Hermione nodded as the penny dropped. “Rosmerta?” Draco nodded with a wry smile. “Yeah. She took it a bit personally that I had her under the imperius curse for six months. I’d probably be pissed off about that too to be fair.”  They carried on around the corner and into the Hog’s Head. Aberforth Dumbledore greeted her with a rough nod, said nothing at all to Theo, then glared heatedly at Draco, who smiled arrogantly back. Aberforth went away shaking his head as Hermione called their order after him. She was starting to see what Draco meant about the pair of them raising eyebrows by being out together. Nobody seemed to notice or object to Theo, but, she supposed, Draco and herself were the more famous ones. Unless someone knew Theo personally they would have no idea about his shady family connections. Aberforth returned minutes later, slammed three butterbeers on the table, then added three smudged and dirty looking glasses. “Thank you.” Hermione gave him a tight-lipped smile. Just as he was walking away he paused then spun around.  “I saw you, laddie,” he spoke to Draco who clearly had no idea who he was. Draco raised an insolent brow as Aberforth regarded him with his twinkling blue eyes. “I saw what you did at the end of the battle. I saw you tend the injured and the dying.” He leaned closer to Draco who now blinked in shock, “I saw you. So don’t go giving me that arrogant I don’t give a toss attitude, I know you care. And, I know you never wanted to kill my brother. Welcome to my pub.” After dropping his bombshell he walked away, wiping his grubby hands on an even filthier towel that was tucked into the waistband of his robes. 
  
  
  

  
  
  
“Wow,” Hermione gasped when they got back to the common room that evening, “how did we get to the top of the leaderboard?”  “We were wondering the same thing?!” Ginny sounded miffed as she looked up from the sofa where she was doing last-minute homework next to Blaise. “We thought we were top!” “Sorry Zabini,” Theo grinned. “We spent the afternoon talking and building relationships, it's not just about the shagging you know.” Blaise looked up from his arithmancy book, adjusted his position nonchalantly, and grinned back at Theo. “Jealous are we Theodore? Two partners and yet you're still not getting any?” Theo just laughed. “Whatever you say, mate, I think the leaderboard speaks for itself, but,” he fixed Blaise with his brilliant blue eyes, “if you want a battle for the top spot, I say bring it the fuck on.”  
  
    Chapter Text
    The week following Hermione, Draco, and Theo’s Hogsmeade date passed relatively uneventfully. The Hogwarts professors kept them so busy and their workload was so heavy that they barely had a chance to do anything more than attend lessons, study and complete homework, then fall into bed exhausted every evening. On top of all their regular coursework, Hermione had been held back after Transfiguration by Professor McGonagall, who, flushed with the success of the Halloween ball, had decided to hold a New Year’s Eve Gala. Instead of the usual end of year feast and unofficial common room parties that always took place, this year they were to have another grand, large scale event and McGonagall wanted some of the students' help to organise it.   Hermione returned from the first planning meeting rather late on Wednesday evening to find the eighth year common room abuzz with activity. She sighed wearily, her head was spinning with all the new gala details and she wasn’t in the mood for any more excitement. “Where are they? Have you seen them? What’s going on?” various people shot questions at her as soon as the door closed behind her. “Who?” she tried not to snap, but her tiredness caused her to sound more irritated than she intended. “Harry and Neville!” Ron said, pointing to the game leaderboard that was propped up in the corner of the room. Hermione blinked in surprise. The board was going haywire, a bright red and green neon tube light was flashing the word disqualified over and over again and Harry, Neville, Pansy and Daphne’s names had disappeared from the board entirely. “I’ve no idea!” she stopped and stared around the room in confusion.  “Harry said they were going to do it though,” Ron said, a hint of pride in his eyes, “all four of them said the pairings were the wrong way round, but you know what this must mean?” “What?” Millicent asked from beside him, looking up from her own essay and staring at him with big doe eyes. “It means they must have swapped. Finally one of them has had a proper kiss.” There was a chorus of oooooh’s and ahhhh’s and Hermione rolled her eyes. Her head was starting to throb with a tension headache and she was feeling more antisocial by the moment. She dropped her things onto the table next to Ron with a clatter then made her way through to the dorms, sinking down onto her bed for a moment's peace then deciding to have a bath. The thought of Harry and Pansy being together was taking a little getting used to, although she supposed that was rather hypocritical of her given her own current relationship status. As she got her things ready there was a soft knock on the door, and she opened it rather harshly to find Theo smiling down at her. “Good evening,” he said, faltering slightly at her harassed look and rather abrupt greeting. “Ron said you were in here, he also said it was best to leave you alone as you were tired and I was likely to get hexed if I disturbed you.” She smiled despite her bad mood. Theo was looking at her with a grin that was both hopeful and rather cheeky, and as he stood ruffling the back of his hair with his hand, she was suddenly struck again by how good looking he was. She couldn’t help but smile back. “And yet, you took the chance anyway.” He grinned. “I’d like to say that I’m a braver man than Weasley, but our track records would disagree, so I’ll just say that I fancy my chances. Also, if I’m wrong I can run quite fast-” he grinned. “Can I come in?” Hermione's face morphed into a look of surprise, “this is a girls room!” she exclaimed, but Theo just looked at her, nodding as if not understanding her point. “Ummm, yes I suppose so then.” Disconcerted, she stepped back to let him follow her inside.  “It’s nice in here.” He looked around with a grin. “Have you seen the game board?” Hermione nodded, still wondering what he was up to and if it would be incredibly rude to throw him out and get her bath in before it got too late. “I have. What happened, and where’s Draco?” “Quidditch training, and Potter and Pansy snogged.”  Despite her bad mood Hermione’s jaw fell open in surprise. “How do you know that?!” Theo winked. “Cupid gets inside information, remember? Also, Pansy just came back to tell us. It was in the back of the library of all places too, she cornered him in the Defense against the Dark Arts section and asked if he’d show her his Patronus. Well he showed her something alright and it disqualified both pairs!” Theo crossed the room and stared at the row of three four poster beds. “Which one’s yours?” “That one.” She pointed, “but I was just going to-” “Have a bath. So I see,” he indicated the towel and shower gel in her hand. “Ron also said you were rather stressed because you’ve been working too hard lately. I came to see if you wanted a massage?” She stopped and stared at him in surprise. “Ron always thinks I work too hard, I suppose that’s what comes of him doing the opposite.” She frowned as Theo laughed. “What?” “He also said you’d say something along those lines. He told me to inform you that his Charms and DADA essays are both finished and that he didn’t copy Milli’s. That is the extent of my message carrying, though, I am not an owl.” Hermione laughed at his affronted look. “You and Ron seem to be talking quite a lot at the moment,” she said, trying to keep the suspicion from her voice as Theo sat down on her bed and kicked his shoes off.  “Is there any reason we shouldn't?” She shook her head as he ran his fingers through his untidy hair, grinned and patted the bed beside him. “I can be nice to people you know, even Ron Weasley. Now, massage, yes or no?” “I don't know.” She sighed, torn between what seemed like a rather tempting offer and the thought of sinking into the bubble filled bliss of the Prefect's bath. Theo rolled his eyes. “My father always says if you offer a witch two choices they’ll take the third. I guess he had to be right about some things.” “Isn’t your father in Azkaban right now?” She frowned at the way that had sounded, she hadn’t meant it to sound so bitter. “Oh, I didn’t mean that how it-” Theo nodded and waved his hand dismissively. “No offence taken but, yes he’s in the cell next to Lucius, opposite Greg’s father in fact. I bet they all have a lovely chat in the mornings over their porridge. Now tell me Hermione,” he wiggled a bottle of massage oil in her direction, “Why are you being so indecisive? It’s not code for me trying to shag your brains out, I’ll even stay on top of your clothes if you prefer.” She looked at him in surprise as she considered his offer. “Okay, I’m convinced.” She didn’t want to tell him that she really did have a thumping headache and had been set on the bath idea.  Her brain was also too scrambled to explain that the only person who had ever touched her intimately was Ron, and even that had stopped at a little bit of light petting. Other than that, a couple of innocent kisses with Victor Krum and what she had already experienced with Theo and Draco, she had no experience at all of what they were getting into here. It was very daunting to suddenly find herself in a relationship with two men, when she barely had experience of being with one man. Also, assuming the Hogwarts rumour mill was to be believed, Theo and Draco both had a lot of experience in that area. Although she had signed up to play this blasted game, so she wasn’t sure if she- Theo winced and held up a hand stopping her rather wild and jumbled train of thought.  “Just so you know, I’m what they call a psychic legilimens. It means that if you shout your thoughts that loudly I can hear every single one of them. Draco can choose whether to listen to what someone projects or not, I can’t. I’m shit at occlumency. Sorry.” “So you know what I was just thinkin- oh Merlin!” she covered her face with her hands as she sighed.  “Umm yes. But, here's the thing. Neither of us knew you felt that way, so we will be much more respectful of your limits from now on. I apologise for coming on a little strong, when you grabbed Draco and snogged his brains out in Hogsmeade we figured you were- never mind. I can be a gentleman when I put my mind to it.” He smiled softly and gestured to the bed beside her again. “I’ll ask you one more time, Would you like a wholly innocent, stress relieving massage?” Hermione sighed again. “Yes, please. That sounds lovely.” She crossed to the bed and sat down feeling relieved.  “It's better if you lay down, but only if you're comfortable doing that.” She nodded again and settled herself on the bed, letting Theo nudge her into position. His touch was heavenly. She was surprised to find herself relaxing as he laid his warm hands on top of her t-shirt and started to move them over her tense shoulders. “How’s this?” he asked as he started to smooth away the tension of the day. “Its, it's lovely actually.” She smiled into the pillow, sighing as she closed her eyes. She hadn't known it, but this had been exactly what she had needed.  “Then relax and let me get rid of these knots.” He probed a little deeper with his thumbs and she groaned into the mattress. “Fuck,” Theo muttered, pausing for a moment to gather his composure and continue. “You can’t be making noises like that love, I’m trying to prove that I can behave myself here.” “Sorry.” She stifled another sigh as he released a particularly uncomfortable spot and she felt herself melting under his skillful fingers. He muttered a wandless spell and the drapes around her bed closed snugly shut. “Can I ask you a question?” “Of course.” He slid his hands lower, starting to work on the muscles in her lower back. “How long have you and Draco been together?” Theo paused, as if wondering how best to answer. “Well we haven’t been in a relationship ever, until now. We’ve played around since third year though.”  “Third year?!” she asked with a yelp, “that's, we were-” “Fourteen,” Theo answered.  “Was he your first kiss then?” “No. That was Daphne.”  “When was that?” Theo laughed. “About five minutes before Draco stuck his tongue in my mouth. It was an eventful evening.” “It sounds like it!” Hermione laughed as well, feeling the last of her tension slip away. Theo’s fingers really were amazing.  “Daph and I kissed to find out what it was like. We were in the quidditch changing rooms after a match one day, we didn’t hear Draco come in, and he didn’t know we were there. Daph squealed and ran out,” Theo laughed, “Draco said we looked as if we didn't have a clue what we were doing. I challenged him to do better, and well lets just say he did. Poor Daph, it was her first kiss too. We’re both much better at it now, just in case you were worried.” Hermione laughed. “I had no complaints on Friday evening.” She paused, shivering at the memory, then blushed because she knew Theo would have felt her physical reaction. “So are you just doing this, umm, relationship attempt purely because of the game?” Theo was silent for a moment, Hermione twisted her head around to look at him. He was gazing down at her as if wondering what to say. “Sorry,” she said a little guiltily, “I didn't mean to pry.” “You're not prying.” He smiled, “I’m just not very good at opening up to people I don’t know terribly well.” She narrowed her eyes slightly, unsure how to take what he had just said. “I've learned to be careful over the years Hermione, that's no reflection on your character. I simply wouldn’t have survived if I hadn’t watched who I left myself open up to, but you're hardly a Death Eater are you?” He let out a breath and she turned onto her side to see him better, “I survived around them for years, you see, and it made me a bit... guarded. No, I’m not just doing it for the game. Neither is Draco. We talked about it the other night, we both want to give things a go. Maybe the game gave us a nudge, but it doesn't really feel like we're playing at anything. When we're together it's natural, it always has been. I think we’ll just use the game as a bit of fun and see where the weekly prompts take us. ” Hermione was surprised to feel a sharp pang of regret at his words. She turned her face back into the pillow as her bottom lip trembled, lest she lose control and embarrass herself by crying, it really had been a long day. “Am I in your way then?” she asked, trying to keep her voice level. Why did it hurt so much to think of Theo and Draco together without her? They’d only had one evening together and one afternoon’s date in Hogsmeade for heaven's sake!  “What?!” Theo sounded genuinely confused as he pulled her shirt straight, “why would you think that? Oh!” he paused, seemingly answering his own question. “No. You're not in the way at all. Left to our own devices, on our own in a relationship I think Draco and I would probably kill each other. Also we both like girls as well as boys. We’ve both had three way encounters before, this is just the first time we’ve tried it as a relationship, although I realise that I’m getting ahead of myself here because I don’t know your intentions with this. Are you just in this for the game, or is there something more for you too?” Hermione sighed, watching him as she considered what to say. “Ginny initially talked me into playing the game because she was after Blaise, I had no interest in it at all. In fact, I’ll be honest, I thought it was a stupid idea, but then Friday evening came, I got a bit unnecessarily upset, Ron kicked my backside and I ended up actually talking to you and Draco. I found that I really enjoyed both of your company. Last Saturday was lovely in Hogsmeade with you both too. Now, I guess I feel the same as you, I’m curious. The sensible side of my mind keeps telling me that this is insanity, Draco and I have so much bad history together, I genuinely thought he hated me, but I’m seeing a different side of him now. You too, although I barely knew you before this. I’ll be honest, I was a little wary of you too, you have quite a reputation.”  Theo stopped rubbing her back and she rolled over onto her side to look up at him. “I’m not sure whether to be proud of that or offended by it.” He laughed as he moved to sit beside her, trailing a finger gently along her upper arm. He paused as the dormitory door opened and several people came in giggling. “Muffliato,” Theo whispered and shuffled a little closer to her. “Is this unfiltered honesty a Gryffindor trait or is it a personal one? As for Draco’s feelings, it’s his story to tell of course but I can assure you he’s never hated you, even back when we were eleven years old and acting like we ruled the world. It was quite the opposite sentiment that caused his objectionable behaviour.”  Hermione looked at him curiously and he placed a finger softly on her lips. “For any more on that subject you'll need to speak to Draco. It's not my place to tell.” She frowned petulantly but let it slide. “I could tell you my own thoughts though.” It felt so natural to lean into him as he shifted position again, and somehow she found herself laying next to him on the bed. He ran his hand down her lower arm then laced his fingers through hers, before running the tip of his thumb over her fingers. “It’s very simple, I like you. I see you as someone very different than me and I want to get to know you better.” “Okay,” she used their joined hands to push her hair out of her eyes and turned to look at him properly. “That’s kind of how I feel about you too.” He nodded. “Opposites attract huh?” “Maybe.” She studied his face, his floppy, dark hair was easily as messy and un-styleable as Harry’s, his brilliant blue eyes felt like they were looking directly into her soul, and his olive skin was smooth under her touch. She looked down at their clasped hands and saw the edge of a tattoo poking out from underneath his sleeve. Curiously she pushed his sleeve up, tracing the design with her thumb before she froze, noticing that her fingers were travelling up the inside of his left forearm.  “Relax,” he chuckled, “It’s not a Dark Mark, it’s just a black tat. Mind you Draco’s is the real thing so you might want to get your head around that if it bothers you.” “Sorry.”  “What for?” he frowned, making his cerulean eyes crinkle attractively at the corners. “I’d imagine it's a touchy subject for you.” “It is. Can I see this?” Theo nodded, pushing his sleeve up further to reveal the tail of a black snake that was entwined with flowers as it coiled its way up his lower arm. Just below his elbow she could see the bottom of what looked like the Hogwarts castle, and just above that was the bottom of something else that she couldn't quite make out. She inched his jumper a little higher but he closed his fingers over her hand. “You’ll cut my circulation off. I could strip but we’ve already established our boundaries in that respect. That’s the bottom of a time turner and there’s a big clock at the top. It's all very symbolic, I’ll tell you what it all means someday.” “It's amazing!” she stared in surprise at the details in the intricate design.  “Hold your thumb on the snake's tail.” “What? Why?” he said nothing more, just fixed her with a look and she did as he bid, snatching her fingers back when the tail flicked right across his arm and physically nudged at her. “Oh Wow! I didn't know tattoos could do that?” “Some can. It depends who does them.”  “Who did this?”  “Blaise’s stepdad. The current one anyway, we spend quite a lot of time in Italy to escape whatever mayhem is going on in this country and everytime I go he adds a bit more to it. He’s teaching Blaise how to do it too but I'm not letting him loose on me just yet.” Hermione nodded. She was starting to feel a bit sleepy, although the stress of her busy day and the worries about her upcoming homework deadlines had literally melted away at the touch of Theo’s hands. He smiled as she yawned. “Shall I leave you to sleep? It seems I’ve stolen your bath from you, I don’t want to take anything else.” She nodded, an early night suddenly sounded exactly what she needed. “Okay,” he slid his fingers up onto her cheek and turned her face to his with a slow, sexy smile. She caught her breath as his tongue flicked out to moisten his lips and she smiled softly back, leaning in until their lips brushed. Their chaste control lasted for almost a whole two seconds before Theo pulled her closer, making her open her mouth in a gasp. Taking full advantage of her hesitancy he slipped his tongue in to claim her mouth. She made a small sound in the back of her throat as she sighed with pleasure. Kissing Theo was very different to kissing Draco. Both times she had kissed Draco he had let her take charge, Theo made it very plain that that wasn’t an option with him. There wasn’t a shadow of a doubt as to who was the dominant one of the pair and the surprise of that caused a thrill of molten desire to flow through her, shocking her with it’s intensity.  It seemed that she was more than happy to surrender all control to him. He pulled her closer, deepening the kiss as he wrapped himself all around her. They were still facing each other on the bed and he hooked a leg over hers, tangling their limbs together as he kissed her face and her neck, then peppered kisses higher before nipping at her earlobe with his teeth. When he kissed her mouth again, time seemed to stop. She let him surround her, whimpering as his stubble brushed against her soft skin. His hot tongue swept across hers, and she inhaled the scent of his cologne mixed with the natural musk of his body. The sound of his breathing blended with her own pulse as it pounded in her ears and it was an intoxicating mix. When he finally pulled back, her eyes were closed and she instinctively reached for him again as he kissed the very tip of her nose. “Good night Hermione,” he whispered, slipping out through the gap in her curtains with a smile that nearly stopped her heart. “Night, Theo,” she whispered back, settling down under the duvet that smelled divinely of him, closing her eyes with a deep sigh and falling fast asleep. 
  
    Chapter Text
    “Come on ‘Mione, Friday night is now girl’s night, it’s written into the rules of the game!” Ginny plucked Hermione’s quill from her hand, replaced the cap on her bottle of ink and grinned. “You enjoyed last Saturday didn’t you? Also, from what I heard from Ron, Theo Nott was in your dorms for a mighty long time the other night, so you can’t say you’re not embracing the game in other ways.” Despite her determination to study, Hermione had to concede that Ginny did have a point. She had spent most of her previous six years at Hogwarts studying diligently while also trying to keep Harry and Ron alive, and then the following two years fighting, and subsequently recovering from fighting Voldemort. None of that time had been particularly conducive to having fun or to being a teenager. She glanced down at her essay and sighed, maybe this particular assignment could wait for one more day. “Okay.” “What?!” Hermione laughed at Ginny’s flabbergasted look. “You're not even going to argue a little bit?” “Not tonight.” Hermione rolled up her parchment then stuffed her books back into her bag before following Ginny out of the library. After a quick freshen up in the dorms she was ready to make her way to the room of requirement for the eight pm meeting.  The room had split itself into two separate halves with a soundproof barrier between the two newly created spaces. “Nice, look at this!” Pansy said, walking in and staring at the drinks trolley in the middle of what was clearly the girls side of the room. There were several bottles of elf made prosecco, a bottle of firewhiskey, several different muggle spirits, a book on cocktail mixing and a note in multicoloured, shimmering writing all set out on a table. “This week’s theme was relationship building and getting to know one another,” Pansy read. “Over the course of this evening you must learn one secret about each other participant. The disclosure of any secrets given to you in confidence will disqualify you from the game and   exclude you from all further activities. Wow! No telling our secrets then girls!” Pansy put the parchment down and picked up the cocktail recipe book instead. Hermione wrinkled her nose apprehensively. She perched on the edge of a squishy sofa next to Luna and Parvarti as Ginny joined Pansy to investigate the drinks. “Ooooh,” Daphne said, peering over their shoulders, “let’s start with that one. Look, it glows in the dark if you add this charm!” The little room was crowded with them all inside. Three large sofas were arranged in a horseshoe shape with the drinks trolley on the fourth side, and Hermione guessed that the boys had a similar arrangement next door. Cho was sitting awkwardly next to Lavender and Hannah, neither of whom she knew very well, while Millicent was sitting alone on the third sofa. No one was saying much. Although all of them got on relatively well these days, none of them were particularly close yet, and things were currently rather strained between them all.   That was until Pansy stepped in of course. “Here, Daph, start giving these out will you please?” she passed a pair of glasses to Daphne who in turn handed them out around the room.  “Thank you,” Hermione eyed the lurid green concoction suspiciously as Ginny held her own glass aloft. “Cheers!” Ginny grinned before taking a sip. “Wow, that tastes better than it looks!” Hermione sniffed her drink cautiously. It was fluorescent green and when Pansy turned the lights off, it actually did glow in the dark. She put her nose to the glass and sniffed again. It smelled fruity, and when she sipped it, it fizzed pleasantly on her tongue before dispersing easily, tasting worryingly non alcoholic. Knowing Ginny as she did, Hermione suspected it was in fact the exact opposite.  Her suspicions were confirmed two hour later when Daphne passed her the third experimental cocktail of the night. This one was bright red and tasted strongly of strawberries. By now Hermione was feeling decidedly tipsy. Tipsy enough to join in the rather lively game of truth or dare that Pansy and Ginny, who were clearly the group's unofficial leaders, had started. “‘Mione?” Ginny asked as the third round of questioning came back to her.  She groaned inwardly. Her first two questions had been relatively harmless but this time she was facing Ginny, and the twinkle in her best friend’s eye suggested that it wasn’t going to be so easy anymore. “Who is the better kisser, Draco or Theo?” “I’m not going to compare them!” Hemrione squeaked, but her indigent squeal was met with giggles.  “Draco!” Pansy shrieked. “Theo,” Daphne answered as though she thought it was obvious. “Draco,” Luna said with a serene smile causing the whole room to turn and goggle at her, “although that may be a rather unfair call because Theodore has only ever kissed my cheek.” “Very definitely Theo,” Lavender said and Hermione felt her jaw drop in amazement. Had they both snogged everyone in the room? “You haven’t answered the question Hermione,” Ginny prompted. “I’m not going to!” truthfully she was already feeling too much affection for the pair of them to compare one against the other. “You’re blushing!” Pansy giggled. “Oh well, if you really won’t spill the beans then take a drink.”  She did, then posed her own question as the game moved on. “Hannah.” “Truth please,” “What’s Greg really like?” To Hermione’s amazement Hannah smiled softly. Her eyes took on a dreamy quality and she looked genuinely happy as she answered the question. “He's surprising,” she said slowly. “Misunderstood. Romantic.” “Did you know he can play the guitar?” Millie asked, tucking her leg up underneath her. “He’s brilliant at it. Once he got over being a little shit with Draco he actually turned into a really nice guy.” “He really is.” Hannah nodded with a smile then moved the questioning on. Hermione zoned out briefly as the game continued. This was much more fun than she had anticipated it was going to be, and she was starting to wonder just how much of this sort of thing she had missed out on over the years. Cho was being very quiet and was looking reflective too, Hermione had been watching her and couldn’t work out if she was just shy, or if she didn’t really want to be involved in the whole evening. Lavender was trying to include her in the conversations but Cho was doing little to join in on her own. “Pansy,” Millie’s next question startled Hermione back to the present moment, “what happened?” “I don’t know what you mean.” “Oh, I think you do. You seem to be disqualified. You too Daph. Spill it girls!” Pansy grinned wickedly. “Shall we call it a case of partner switching? Neville’s nice but he’s far too calm for me. He’d lay down and let me walk all over him and that’s not right. I need someone with a bit more….. drama, a bit more bite. Harry’s got a hell of a temper at times and he’s hot as fuck. I’ll never forget how he held his nerve as he stared You Know Who in the eye,” she shivered as she grinned wickedly.  “Neville is nice,” Daphne agreed with a smile, “I’m liking the chance to get to know him. I don’t rush into things easily, but, we’ll see. Have you kissed Harry yet Pans?” “Have we kiss- Yes! You know we have Daph. And, oh my Gods was it amazing! Ginny what the hell did you dump him for? Seriously, I can’t believe you let him go!” Ginny laughed then shook her long hair back into place. “He’s a good kisser I’ll grant you, but I spent most of my childhood pining over him and well, now I want to play the field a bit. I want to experiment with being a proper, irresponsible teenager, you know?" “So you picked Blaise to do that with? Go on tell us more, what’s he like?” Lavender asked and they pulled the sofas closer together as the evening turned much more intimate. Another hour, and another purple cocktail later, the piece of parchment with the aim of the evening written on was behaving very strangely. Not only was it flashing in an eye popping manner, it had now started to emit an irritating high pitched wail. Cho, who had refused any more alcohol after her second cocktail picked it up. “I think we need to tell each other a secret.” “Ooooooh!” Millie squealed, let’s start. “Pavarti. You go first.” Pavarti gulped and stared at Luna looking stricken. Luna picked up their clasped hands and smiled in encouragement. “Okay, umm... well, I haven’t officially told my family or even my sister that I’m gay. I know Padma knows, but I haven’t said it out loud to her yet, and I’m worried about what my parents will say.” Her words were met with such a chorus of support and encouragement that unexpected tears sprang to Hermione’s eyes. Maybe there was something to be said for having a large group of supportive girlfriends after all. “I’ve told my father,” Luna said, “he was very happy for me. But, I also quite like boys as well. Since you’ve said you’re happy to experiment I’d say that my secret is that I’d like to do that at some point.” Pavarti blushed deeply and Luna looked at her in apparent confusion. “You do blush a lot Pavarti, if I say something that makes you uncomfortable, you can tell me you know.” Pavarti merely nodded, and Hermione thought it was a mark of the growing friendships in the room that no one commented on Luna’s closing statement.  Hannah cleared her throat, “My secret is that I’ve not really had a proper boyfriend before. And I’d really like my first one to be Greg. I want to kiss him. But I’m not sure if he wants to kiss me.” “He does!” Pansy asserted. “Believe me, he does. Just grab him and go for it!!!” This instruction was met with another chorus of approval and Hannah looked positively glowing as she nodded. “My secret is that I don’t think Dean is the one for me,” Lavender confided. “I mean, I’ll try of course, because I think this game is really fun, but I’m just not sure that we’re right for each other.”  Her statement was met with supportive murmurs as all heads turned to Millie. “I really like Ron,” she confessed, turning a deep shade of red. “I never thought I would, but actually, he’s very funny, very thoughtful and he’s treating me like a princess. I want to stay in the game and to stay with him for a bit longer to see what happens between us.” Next in line was Pansy, but she shook her head instead of answering. “Nope, me and Daph are out. We don’t have to contribute but if you want my secret anyway, I’m aiming to get into Potter’s pants this weekend.” This outrageous statement was met with shrieks of laughter and a full discussion on the best way of doing just that. Hermione couldn’t help but be intrigued, although she also suddenly understood Ginny’s intense distaste for talking about any of her brother’s sex lives. Harry had always felt like a brother to her and there had never been anything remotely sexual between them. It was odd imagining him with Pansy, and even odder hearing Pansy openly discuss this side of him with Ginny. “Uh huh,” Daphne shook her head when it was her turn. “I’m also out but I do promise not to tell any of your secrets. Ginny?” Ginny grinned. “Blaise is the best sex I ever had.”  Pansy burst out laughing, “compared with who?” “Ummm…. The other people that I have slept with.” Ginny flicked back her hair and started at Pansy with an air of drunken defiance. “Which would be who?” Pansy tucked her own immaculate bob behind her ear as she grinned. Clearly she wasn’t going to let Ginny off the hook that easily. “Umm, well, Harry… Dean and-” There was a very pregnant pause in which Ginny blushed beet red, “Michael Corner.” “Aaaaaand?” Pansy made a hurry up motion with her hand as Ginny covered her face with her hands then mumbled something that no one could quite make out. “I’m sorry, we didn’t quite catch that,” Pansy said, laughing at Ginny’s glare. “You’re a meddlesome witch Pansy Parkinson. You know full well I’m trying not to mention Draco Malfoy.” There was a collective gasp from the room at large and Ginny sighed. “It was in my sixth year when things were a little umm, tricky here. It just kind of happened and that’s all I’m going to say for now!” All eyes turned to Hermione and Cho next, as they were the only ones yet to tell a secret. “I’ll say one,” Cho offered, “but it’s not really a sexual one so you might be a bit disappointed. I think Seamus is very nice, but I’m not sure this game is right for me. It feels a bit pressured and although you are all very lovely, I’m just not sure how long I’m going to continue playing it for.”  Polite nods met her confession and there were more supportive murmurs from everyone. Given Cho’s reluctance to join in throughout the evening it was hardly a surprise that she felt this way. “Hermione?!” Ginny said, bringing the focus back onto her.  Hermione sighed, she’d known that she wouldn’t be able to avoid the spotlight forever. “I’m really surprised by how much I like both of my partners,” she said, smiling at the chorus of whistles that met her admission. “I thought I’d hate them both, but I really don’t." “Exactly how much do you not hate them Hermione?” Lavender asked with a grin, “only there was a very definite Muffliato charm cast around your bed two nights ago.” Hermione blushed. “That was Theo, but all we did was kiss. After he'd given me a very nice massage. I’m not rushing things, I’ve never, you know? I want it to be, and oh good grief, that’s enough information!” “Wait…. You’ve never?” Daphne asked, “as in, you haven’t?” Hermione shook her head. “Oh wow, you are lucky, then. I’d have my first time with either of those two, but both of them together, Merlin! You're a lucky girl!” And the conversation that followed that little revelation was the reason that Hermione ended up flooing into Grimmauld with a hangover for the second weekend in a row.....
  
  
  “For fuck’s sake!” Sirius muttered, “I mean it, much more of this and I’ll start charging you lot for breakfast and hangover potions. Oh, and first aid advice.” “Hmph. Good morning to you too, Mr grumpy pants,” Ginny laughed, taking two vials of hangover potion from the now vastly depleted stock in the cupboard and passing one to Hermione. “You need to make some more of this by the look of things. Did you get out of bed on the wrong side this morning?” “I would still be in bed if you lot didn't keep waking me up,” Sirius grumbled as he rubbed a hand over the stubble on his face. “We didn’t get much sleep last night.” “Oh? Why was that?” Ginny asked, fixing him with a bright grin. Sirius rolled his eyes, “unfortunately it wasn't for the reason you're thinking. It's the full moon in exactly seven days time and Wolfsbane needs almost constant attention for the twelve hours it takes to brew. We mixed up the dates, so ended up brewing it overnight. Neither of us are the best potioneers either, as you know, so it was a little tricky. Remus is still asleep now, so I'm on breakfast duty.” “Oh dear God!” Ginny took the pan he was wielding and put it on the stove herself before turning to hunt for something to put in it.  “What did you mean by first aid advice?” Hermione asked, noticing Harry, Ron, Neville, and bizarrely, Seamus all sitting at the table as her hangover potion started to kick in. “I wouldn’t ask for too many details there either if I were you,” Sirius said with an amused shake of his head.  “Are you all alright, Sea?” Hermione ignored him as Ginny tipped sausages into the pan. She pulled out a chair, analyzing the boys for injuries as the floorboards creaked overhead. “I am now,” Seamus said, wincing as he stroked his bruised face with the arm that wasn't in a sling.  “We ended up in a rather impromptu, drunken game of four on four quidditch at midnight last night, Seamus had the unfortunate experience of crashing headlong into Greg,” Ron explained. Seamus grimaced. “He barely has a bruise. Meanwhile I fell off and plummeted twenty feet to the ground. It’s a damn good thing Blaise was so quick with the slow falling charm. I didn’t really want to go to Madam Pomfrey and explain what we’d been up to-” “And this,” Ginny gestured to the table at large, “is the reason why women live longer than men. Why do you have a black eye Harry?” Harry rolled his eyes. “I collided with Malfoy’s elbow in a race to the snitch. He still plays dirty as hell.” “How did you even see it in the dark?” Ginny asked as Hermione’s eyes widened. “Glow in the dark charm,” Harry said as if it was obvious. “Who got the snitch?” Hermione asked the question, but she wasn’t altogether sure that she wanted to know. She couldn't help but giggle at Harry's affronted look, though. “Please, ‘Mione. I did!” “Well done. Yes, I don’t think explaining all of this to the teachers would have gone down too well,” Hermione chuckled as Sirius muttered something that sounded suspiciously like “That’s my boy.” “I think you’ll find the teachers know all about the game.” Remus said rubbing his eyes as he walked into the kitchen.  “You were a teacher and you knew about the game because you helped make it, Moony, not all of them will-” Remus waved Sirius' argument away. “I’d put money on them all knowing. Snape played don’t forget. He can’t have been the only one who’s had a go over the years.” “Wait a sec,” Harry took the ice bag he was holding to the side of his head off, turned it over then reapplied it, “Snape played? Severus Snape, Potions Master of doom and all around hater of all things Marauder. You’re telling me that Snape played this game?” Hermione stopped rummaging in the cupboards and turned to stare incredulously at Sirius too. “Yeah, of course he did. He was hoping to pair up with your Mum, Harry. It was funny because he didn’t, and we all know where that one ended up, don’t we?” “Actually no.” Harry squared his shoulders, “you’ve told me many stories over the years, but not this one.” “Ah,” Sirius said, exchanging a look with Remus. “Yes. Well, maybe that’s because telling it involves a slight confession on my part, but I suppose we should tell you what happened since you’re playing it yourselves now. Snape paired with Neville’s mum actually, they went out in the second week though so they didn’t last too long together.” “So, did my Mum and Dad pair together then?” Harry asked hesitantly as Neville spluttered into his tea and Remus passed him a tissue. Ginny dropped a hand onto Harry’s shoulder and squeezed reassuringly as he turned instinctively to nuzzle against her. “Not exactly,” Sirius said with a sigh. “Lily initially refused to play if she got paired with James. It was her one condition. She paired with Remus though, and I paired with Marlene Mckinnon. Your dad paired up with Mary Macdonald, Harry.” “Soooo, what happened?” Hermione rushed to flip the sausages that Ginny had forgotten in favor of supporting Harry. Ron took over buttering the bread as the smell of burning started to fill the kitchen and Remus waved it lazily away with his wand.   “Well, as you know cheating on your partner is an instant disqualification. Your dad went out in week one. He and Mary didn’t see eye to eye at all, and one night Mary, uh, kissed somebody else. “Sirius looked shiftily around the kitchen as he spoke. “Your dad stayed around to help me out as Cupid, and that’s when Lily started to talk to him and give him the time of day. Lily figured that he had been treated rather unfairly and that he hadn’t deserved to go out so early, and certainly not in that way. “Who did Mary Macdonald kiss?” Harry was staring suspiciously at Sirius as Sirius turned his back on the table to help Ron, flicking his shaggy hair out of his face as he went.  “What’s that now?” “You heard.” “Ah yes, the thing to remember here is that it all ended well, didn’t it?” “Sirius! It was you, wasn’t it?”  Sirius grimaced as he turned, gesturing wildly with the spatula, “Look. I was in a quandary. I was questioning my own sexuality at the time and trying to prove to myself that I liked girls. Things, well, things happened. Your parents both forgave me, in fact they credited me for helping them get together because it put them into a situation where they had to talk to one another sensibly. So when all was said and done it was a helpful thing to do. And the following week you’re mum and Remus forfeited, and that’s how myself and Re got together.” “How?” Ron said blanky, “how does Remus and Lily forfeiting put you and Remus together? and James and Lily?” Sirius sighed, “well, although James wasn’t cross that I’d kissed Mary, he was pissed off that Snape had technically beaten him in a game that was romance based. I told him I’d make it up to him and he dared me to kiss Remus as a forfeit. So, I did. And the fact that it turned into a full on snogging and groping session caused Lily and James to back out of the room giggling and to give each other a high five. They raided my firewhisky stash to celebrate, got pissed and ended up together that very night.  “So there’s hope for you and Pansy then H,” Ron said, tipping sausages onto plates then handing them out. “Myself and Millie are doing very nicely together as well. And, unlike some people, you and I stayed on our brooms last night so it’s all looking good for us so far.” “Don’t forget Pads, kissing wasn’t all that you, Mary, and Marlene got up to that night was it?” Remus teased, “which is why you three weren’t disqualified as well.” He patted Sirius affectionately, letting Sirius catch his arm as he turned. “In fact it was Sirius kissing me that ensured we were all booted out. How long was it before Mary and Marlene spoke to you again Siri?” As it always did when those two touched, the atmosphere in the room abruptly changed. Suddenly it felt charged with sexual chemistry as they held each other's hands and their gazes heated. “They forgave me pretty quickly. You could have joined us anytime you liked that first night you know,” Sirius said, raking his eyes possessively over Remus’s body. Hermione sucked in a tiny affected breath at the way they looked at each other, even after all of these years. If she could achieve half of the passion that Sirius and Remus managed to maintain in her own relationships, she would be very happy indeed.” Remus stared down at their joined hands then flicked glowing amber eyes back up to Sirius’s face. “You know I don’t share what’s rightfully mine Pads.” His voice came out as a low growl and Hermione held back an affected whimper as Sirius grinned straight back.  “Trust me Moons, I’d never share you these days.” “Ahem!!” Harry said loudly and they both laughed as Sirius and Remus finally turned away from each other. “My Gods, are they always like that?” Seamus asked quietly, and Harry gave a long suffering nod as Neville sat quietly nursing his tea and bemoaning the fact that his mum had, however briefly, once dated Severus Snape.
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione was still affected by Sirius and Remus’ interactions when she floo’d back to Hogwarts that afternoon. The weather outside was appalling, it was raining and blowing a gale, and she wandered over to the common room window to watch the leaves blow wildly around the grounds while she relived the moment she had just witnessed. She thought back to the Halloween Ball, how she had been similarly affected by watching Theo kiss Draco, and a fresh shiver of arousal caused her to shudder. “Are you alright Granger?” She froze as Draco’s drawling voice washed over her, doing nothing to stem the disconcerting throb of arousal between her legs.  “Ummm yes, thank you,” she said, relieved to find that she didn’t sound as affected as she felt.   “Have you been to Sirius Black’s house for brunch again?” he asked, and she inhaled deeply, pressing her thighs together in the hope of finding some relief but it didn’t help in the slightest. Draco was still regarding her strangely. “Are you quite sure you're alright?” She spun around as he approached, her eyes widening as she took in the sight of him. He was once again fresh from the shower, his hair was still wet, and it hung in untidy clumps around his face, just the way she liked it best. The black muggle t-shirt he wore contrasted starkly with his alabaster skin, as did the Dark Mark that he wasn’t even attempting to hide, and her heart rate sped up another notch. She knew she shouldn’t want him, for all his apologies and newfound courteous attitude he was still the boy who had taunted her for years and the sensible part of her brain was still warning her to stay well away from him. But the promise of sin in his rapidly heating gaze made her do the exact opposite. She bit her bottom lip, unable to speak as he stalked nearer, cocking his head to look at her in confusion. “Seriously, what-” he stopped and his concerned look turned into a devilish smirk, “wait, what’s got you so turned on?” Hermione swallowed hard. She ran her tongue over her bottom lip, wondering what to do. She wanted to grab him and to kiss him into oblivion the way she had the previous weekend in Hogsmeade, but she had no idea what would happen if she did that when they were in private. “I umm, I might have seen something that-” she broke off as his expression changed. His smirk turned into a dashing smile and his eyes visibly darkened as his lips parted slightly.  “Wow! That was a lucky guess.” His voice was low and the deep base notes in it spoke to something primal deep inside her. He stepped closer to her until he was just outside of her personal space. She inhaled the scent of his shower gel, cedar and pine with just a hint of mint. His eyes narrowed as he watched her reaction. “What did you see?” She was so affected she could barely speak. “It was,” her voice was shaky, he held her gaze as he moved a hair's breadth closer, “just a moment between two men, but it made me think of you kissing Theo last week…. and I,” she broke off and closed her eyes. When she opened them again he was standing directly in front of her. “And you what?” “I was a little…. affected.” He nodded. “I see. So, you like watching two men together do you?” His voice was so low she could barely hear it.  “Apparently so.” Draco reached out a hand then ran it very gently down her side making her shiver. “That’s fortunate. Theo told me about your conversation the other night though, so I don’t want to rush you. This moves at your speed and I’m happy to wait until you're ready before we do anything.” “What If I don’t want to wait?” her whisper broke into a breathy gasp as he took another step towards her. “What if I’ve waited long enough already?” Draco smiled gently. “If that is the case then I will take great pleasure in showing you…..” he brushed his lips over hers, “exactly….” he kissed her, “what you’ve…..” another kiss, “been….” kiss, “missing out on.” Hermione's tenuous self control broke. She grabbed him, pulling him towards her and groaning as he wrapped his strong arms around her. Her knees were already weak and she stumbled as he slid his hands down her body and under her thighs. He stooped slightly then picked her up, wrapped her legs around his waist and carried her into what she knew to be the Slytherin boys dorm. Once inside, he kicked the door shut, set her gently down, then eased her backwards until the wall stopped her with a gentle bump. He leaned forwards to kiss her again and Hermione whimpered as he pushed his thigh up between her legs. She pulled her dishevelled hair out of her eyes as she rubbed herself shamelessly against him, trying to relieve the aching pulse in her core.  Their kisses grew more urgent, Draco tangled his own fingers into her hair and they both froze as the dormitory door opened again. “Oh,” said another startled, deep male voice. “What do we have here?” Hermione gasped with shock as she looked over Draco’s shoulder into Theo’s amused eyes. “Am I interrupting?” A thrill of shock radiated through Hermione’s entire body. Draco turned his head lazily, regarding Theo with interest. “You're very welcome as it happens. Hermione here just confessed to a rather fortunate little kink, you can help me explore it.” Theo dumped two full shopping bags beside his bed and stretched the tension out of his arms. “I see. And what exactly did she confess to?” “Apparently our little witch gets extremely turned on when she sees two men kiss.” Theo’s lips curled up into a smirk as his gaze heated. “My my. That is fortunate.” “Isn’t it?” Draco brought his thigh up to slowly brush between Hermione’s legs again and she whimpered softly in response. “Come here then, both of you.” Draco chuckled as he lifted an eyebrow in amusement. “Always so bossy, Nott.” Theo just smiled even more broadly. “As if you find that a problem.” He fluffed the pillows and patted the bed until Hermione crossed unsteadily to him and sank onto the soft mattress. She inhaled deeply as Theo’s scent surrounded her, wondering if it was possible to pass out from anticipation alone. Draco took his time in doing as he was told, but Theo just coolly waited him out. “What is it that turns you on then beautiful?” Theo asked, studying her closely. “Oh, I see.” He smiled, and Hermione felt the merest prickling of his legilimency in the front of her mind. Theo gestured to Draco then took the hand he offered in reply, holding it and staring at him in the same way that Remus had held Sirius. “Just touching then? Or how would you feel about this?” He pulled Draco closer, stroked his still damp hair away from his face then cupped his jaw with one hand and leaned in to press a gentle kiss to his lips.  The look of desire in Draco’s eyes was enough to make Hermione moan again. Theo stepped closer, pulling Draco into him, deepening the kiss and tearing a low groan from him as well. They continued to devour each other as Hermione sat panting softly with desire. It was the single sexiest thing she had ever seen. When they finally pulled apart, they both looked just as affected as she felt. Draco turned to her with a cheeky grin, “was that the kind of thing you had in mind?” She nodded, not trusting herself to speak. Theo closed the drapes around the bed with a flick of his wrist as Draco sat down on the bed, regarding him from under heavily lidded eyes.  Theo turned with a smile to Hermione. “Your turn.” It was a statement, not a question and her core tightened with need as she nodded. He sat on the bed beside her to kick off his shoes. “I apologize by the way.” “What for?” she asked in confusion. “Invading your mind without your permission. I told you I can’t help it sometimes. You do seem to project your thoughts quite loudly.” “Some people have no finesse with their mind magic,” Draco said, smirking as he examined his nails carelessly. Theo merely rolled his eyes. “Bugger off, you. No one asked your opinion and we can’t all be as polished as you are!” “Your lack of asking for it has never stopped me from giving my opinion before,” Draco replied and Hermione consciously relaxed as Theo grinned. She had tensed up before she had realized they were both joking.  Theo shuffled closer to her, then took her hand in his. “You alright, beautiful?” She nodded, holding her breath as he leaned in to kiss her softly, sweetly, and in complete contrast to the way he had just dominated Draco. “You’ll tell me if you're not, right?” she nodded again as he pulled back, gesturing to Draco to take over. “If you want to stop anytime that’s fine,” Theo’s eyes were dancing with mischief as he backed up and sank into the chair that Draco had just vacated, “but Draco here is particularly talented at bringing people off. Have you ever had an orgasm given to you by someone else?” She shook her head, wondering when the ability to speak had deserted her. “Perfect.” Theo licked his lips. Do you mind if I watch?” Draco chuckled. “I think she’s quite open to that idea,” he said with a smile. Hermione blushed as he ran his fingers over her cheek then tilted her chin up to kiss her again. Instinctively she moved closer to him as he claimed her mouth with his tongue. His hands roamed lower until they gently slid underneath her top. She sucked in a gasp as his fingers brushed across the bare skin of her stomach, and against the soft swell of her breasts. Draco kissed her face, moving his lips slowly down her neck then stopping for a moment to suck a gentle love bite into her sensitive skin.  The feeling was intense, Hermione wriggled her top out of the way to offer more of herself to him. Draco responded by sliding it up, over her head then dropping it to the floor with a smile. “Gorgeous,” he breathed in a voice low enough to make her toes curl. The bra she had chosen that morning was black and lacy and it pushed her breasts up in a way that, judging by their appreciative groans, both men found enticing. Draco stroked his fingers slowly across the cups and she gasped as her nipples hardened almost painfully under his touch. He slid down the bed to kiss her stomach, tickling his tongue over her belly button and smiling as she squirmed in response. As he moved upwards again she arched towards him and he used the opportunity to flick her bra clasp undone.  He held her gaze as he brought his hands up to her shoulders then took hold of the bra straps, silently asking for her permission to lower them. She nodded, watching as he slowly brought them down her upper arms and slid them completely off. Hermione heard Theo take a ragged breath and she felt herself blush as the pair of them stared hungrily at her naked upper body. Theo stood up as Draco took one of her nipples into his mouth causing her to close her eyes with a groan, only for them to snap open again as Theo touched her other side.  “May I?” he asked and she nodded, mesmerized as he settled himself down beside Draco and mirrored his attentions. The feel of them both, sucking and licking her sensitive buds was almost too much for her to bear. It was overwhelming, pleasure pulsed through her, white hot and delicious as Theo nipped gently with his teeth. Someone unzipped her jeans and eased them down, she didn’t know who, all she could do was lay back and  feel  as they both slowly ravished her.  Two sets of fingers wriggled her jeans the rest of the way down her legs and she felt someone brush a hand over the gusset of her panties. “Fuck,” Draco muttered, “sweetheart, you’re drenched.” Theo released her other nipple with a pop and reached down to feel for himself. Both of them touching her so intimately when she had never felt a man’s hand in that way was almost enough to tip her over the edge.  “Look at me,” Theo commanded and she knew what he was going to do before she felt it this time. “You are exquisite.” He smiled, obviously seeing the thoughts she was purposely trying to show him. “I see you're happy to continue.” At Theo’s words, Draco moved her panties to one side then stroked his finger back and forth a couple of times before slipping just the very tip inside and watching closely for her reaction.  Hermione groaned, tipped her head back and bucked uncertainly up against him, wanting, needing to feel more. Gently he pushed his finger in deeper and curled it as he moved it gently against her back wall. “Are you okay with this?” he asked. As touched as she was by his concern she was almost losing her mind. She needed him to pick up the pace. “Yes!” she gasped breathlessly, “please, more,” Draco chuckled as he obliged, carefully adding another finger and starting to move them in and out until she keened. He changed positions and kissed her mouth again, swallowing her moan as Theo brushed her clit with his thumb. They both seemed to be ridiculously talented and she was close, so close. She inched down the bed to urge Draco’s fingers slightly deeper then cried out as he brushed against what felt like a bundle of pure nerves. Theo pinched her clit, rolling it gently between his finger and thumb until the pressure became almost unbearable. “Oh!” she cried as one more stroke of Draco’s fingers caused her to detonate in a way that she had never managed before.  It was incredible, stars burst behind her eyelids, she threw her head back and arched her back, pressing into them as they both stroked her through her climax then held her gently as she came back down to earth.  “Hey,” Draco said, smiling as she finally opened her eyes. “Hey,” she said, watching curiously as he slowly withdrew his fingers and held them out to Theo. Theo smiled, took Draco's hand in his own, brought his fingers to his lips and made a show of slowly licking them clean. He grinned at Hermione's look of surprise before reaching down to kiss her once more. She gasped, tasting herself on his tongue, and her body fizzled with more waves of pleasure in response to Draco’s sinful chuckle.  “How was that then, beautiful?” Theo asked. She just smiled up at him, her whole body felt as if it had melted into the bed. “That was incredible.” His smirk only lasted a moment before it turned into an affectionate smile. “Good.”  “Believe me gorgeous, there’s plenty more where that came from.” Draco smiled, flopping down beside her with a soft smile of his own, “you only have to ask.”
  
  
  
  The Room of Requirement had turned itself back into a single room for that evening’s meeting. Hermione walked in rather shyly, holding hands with Draco, and blushed as Ginny squealed with glee at the sight. Instead of sofas, bean bags large enough for two were arranged in a circle, and Hermione settled into one with Draco, while Ginny and Blaise sat on the one to their left, and Pansy and Harry grabbed the one on their other side. As soon as Harry sat down he and Pansy started giggling and Ginny goggled at the sight of them entwined so closely together. “Oi! Pans?” Ginny called and the dark-haired witch reluctantly stopped kissing Harry to turn her head incredulously.  “What? Wait a sec, did you just “oi” me Weasley?” Ginny grinned. “Indeed I did. Well?” “I'm very well indeed, thank you,” Pansy said, giving Ginny a satisfied smile. “Pansy!” Ginny’s mouth dropped open in a look of fake scandal. “Ginevra.” Pansy’s smirk was all the confirmation Hermione needed, Harry had returned from Grimmauld Place and he and Pansy had disappeared for the entire afternoon. Now it seemed she knew where they had gone. “Details witch!” Ginny demanded. Pansy's eyes gleamed. “Oh, there were many.” “How was it?” Ginny eagerly scooted forwards in her beanbag to listen. Blaise glanced at Hermione, then back at Ginny looking completely mystified. “What the fuck are you two talking about?” Draco looked just as confused, “search me mate.” Pansy put her hands over Harry’s ears and grinned like the Cheshire Cat, “He is a-maz-ing in bed!” Hermione giggled then clapped a hand over her mouth as Draco's eyes widened. “Pans!” Draco exclaimed looking suddenly horrified, “I do not need to hear how the chosen one is in bed thank you!”  Harry blushed, holding his hands up in surrender. He looked highly relieved when Theo bounced into the room and bowed theatrically once again. Theo had forgone the Cupid’s costume this week, which Hermione felt was a shame given that she now knew what his body looked like underneath it. The rest of his act was just as dramatic as usual, though. “Good evening ladies and gents,” he greeted them all with a cheeky wink and unfurled the leaderboard. “At the close of the first week of play we have some rather interesting developments to report.” He paused to survey the participants in front of him on the bean bags. “Sadly we lost 2 couples, Pansy and Neville, and Daphne and Harry. This leaves us with a little problem, Gryffindor now has no team captain, since their initial one forfeited the game for a snog in the library.... What’s that Pansy?" he cupped his hand to his ear as she grinned, "oh, I’m reliably informed that it’s not just snogging that’s going on between them now….” Pansy stood up and took a bow of her own as the clapping in the room intensified, while Harry looked ready to disappear through the floor. “So moving swiftly on, it seems only fair to pass the badge to Hermione since she is partnered with the Slytherin team captain,” Theo grinned as he stepped forwards and passed her the Captain’s arrow badge. “So with those four out, the leaderboard stands thus.” Hermione glanced at it as she pinned her badge in place. Ginny and Blaise were in first place, she blinked in surprise to see that she Draco and Theo were tied for second place with Luna and Parvarti, fourth was Ron and Millicent, fifth Hannah and Greg, sixth, Seamus and Cho, and Lavender and Dean were in seventh place down at the bottom.  “So, we move on to week two!” Theo brought their attention back to himself and the bulging bags that Hermione had seen him bring into the dorms earlier in the afternoon. “The theme for next week is sensations.” He unfurled yet another piece of parchment with the next week’s rules written on it, and left it hanging in mid air. “You are to explore all things sensory with your partner. Learn how they see the world, learn what music they like, how they like to be touched, what their favorite food is, and what scents they like, that sort of thing.” He waved his wand, a table appeared in front of him and he began unpacking items from the bags onto it. “Just a moment,” he finished laying the contents of the bags out, then grinned. “Excluding the people who are out of the game, every couple needs to take five items, one for each of the senses. You know how the points tally up now, you get extra credit for being creative with this week's theme. Remember though, get caught playing the game and your out, cheat and your out, be a dick and you lose points. Okay, so the couple in first place gets first pick. Up you get Gin, ladies first.” Ginny bounced up to the table with Blaise following closely behind. “Ooooh!” she squealed, eyeing the items on the table carefully before choosing a feather and a bottle of scented massage oil. Blaise chuckled as he picked out a bottle of edible body paint, an odd looking pair of glasses, and a cd. “Hermione, Luna, Parvati, Draco?” Theo asked, and Hermione made her way to the table. There was a huge array of items, she watched Luna and Parvarti exploring them for a moment before turning uncertainty to Draco. “Want some suggestions?” he asked and she nodded. He picked up a similar cd to the one Blaise had chosen, a scented candle and a tube of something multicolored, then turned to face her with a smirk. “Your choice now, I’ve got these three, I’ve left you sight and touch, you can choose how far you want to go with this.” Hermione gazed at the unfamiliar items, still at a loss as to which ones to choose. “Do you trust me?” Draco asked, seeing that she was still faltering.  “Weirdly I do. In this area, anyway, but what are you planning to choose?” “Good girl.” With an amused glance at Theo who tried and failed to look innocent, Draco picked up a silk scarf and a blindfold. He turned to Hermione who gazed at his selection with wide eyes. “Hey, less of that look please, you said you trusted me.” She pulled in a shaky breath, remembering that she'd said exactly that. Theo nodded his approval as Draco held the items up, then they stepped away from the table to let the others in. When everyone was done, and Pansy had taken her pick of the leftover items to try out on Harry, Theo rolled up the leaderboard with a tap of his wand then tidied the rest of the goodies away. “Off you go then, everyone. Friday is girls/boys night remember, and we meet back here next Saturday. Good luck all of you.” He waited until Harry had checked the map and let everybody safely out before joining Hermione and Draco by the door. “Alright petal?” he asked, ruffling Draco’s hair. Hermione nodded as Draco ducked out of his reach. “Interesting choices mate. I’m thoroughly looking forward to trying all of those out. On both of you.” Theo's kiss was hot and full of promises as he moved from Hermione to Draco, then flicked the door carelessly open with his wand. 
  
    Chapter Text
    “What did you choose from Theo’s table of goodies on Sunday then?” Ginny asked during a shared free period on Tuesday morning, “I saw Malfoy pick out the blindfold. What else did you lot get?” Hermione blushed as she pictured the items currently tucked away in one of the boy’s bedrooms. “A silk scarf, a scented candle, a cd, and something in a bottle that changes color.” “Oh my!” Ginny grinned. “Tell me, have you ever been tied up and blind- actually don’t answer that!” she suddenly held up a hand, looking horrified, “because that would be an experience that you shared with my brother, and I don’t need  that image in my head.” “No,” Hermione giggled, “you can relax, Gin. I never did anything like that with Ron.” They both looked up as Cho Chang walked over and hovered awkwardly beside them. “Hi Cho, are you alright?” Hermione asked, concerned by the other girls' obvious agitation. Cho nodded as Ginny patted the sofa beside her. Cho perched on the edge, staring at her knees. “I just wanted to tell you that I’m pulling out of the game,” she said in a rush as Hermione looked at her in surprise. “I wasn’t sure about playing it in the first place, you see, I agreed to take part because Luna asked me to, but it’s just not for me. I’m really sorry. I wish you all the best of luck with the rest of it. I’ve already told Seamus, it’s nothing to do with him either. He’s been the perfect gentleman, but it all just feels a bit wrong to me. Anyway, here’s my pin. Can you pass it back to Theo for me, please? I don’t really want to see.… anyway thank you, umm, I’ll see you around I suppose.” With that, she practically fled from the sofa leaving Hermione to stare at the pin in confusion and Ginny to roll her eyes. “What was all that about?” Hermione asked. “I think there are a few people who still think badly of the Slytherins,” Ginny confided in a whisper. “I overheard her telling some of her friends that she wasn’t comfortable being around them too much, there were a surprising number of people in the group who agreed with her.”  Hermione narrowed her eyes in Cho’s direction. “Hmmm.” She tucked that nugget of information away for later then forced her mind back to the present. “Never mind that for now. Tell me what you know about the items that Draco picked out, Gin. I’m curious. I want to know what I might be in for.”
  
  
  
  It seemed that Hermione was destined to find out what the two boys had in mind the very next day. Wednesday evening saw Hermione sitting with Pansy, Hannah, Millicent, and Luna, finishing off a particularly challenging transfiguration essay and chatting about the game.   “Have you kissed Greg yet Hannah?” Pansy asked out of the blue, making Hannah look up with a shy smile and a blush. “Oooo! Tell me all about it!” Pansy scooted forwards in her chair, grinning as Hannah smiled even more broadly. “Did he kiss you, or did you kiss him first?” “We sort of kissed each other at the same time,” Hannah confessed as everyone put their quills down, all thoughts of the troublesome essay temporarily forgotten. “And?!” Pansy exclaimed when Hannah failed to say any more, “How was it?” “It was really lovely,” Hannah confirmed, pushing her sandy blonde hair out of her eyes. “You were right, by the way, he wasn’t sure if I wanted to kiss him, so he was waiting for me to make the first move." Pansy nodded. “That doesn't surprise me in the slightest. Greg’s totally clueless when it comes to girls I’m afraid. Anyway, what about you, Granger? What’s this I heard about you and Draco in Theo’s bed last weekend?” It seemed that their study session was going no further. There was a chorus of oooh’s and ahhh’s as Hermione gave them all the abridged details of her afternoon in the Slytherin dorms. She was smiling broadly by the time she was finished telling the story, as unexpected as it was, she was definitely growing to like being part of a big group of girlfriends. She decided her essay could wait just a little longer. She was finally finishing it when Draco and the others stomped their way in from quidditch training later that evening. With the extra seventh and eighth years being kept out of the usual school teams and therefore being unable to compete for the quidditch cup, they had unofficially formed their own house teams. All students who just wanted to play for fun attended official skills training with Madam Hooch one evening each week, and those who were on the teams attended further training sessions run by their team’s captain. Judging by the sudden influx of multicolored robes now filling the common room, tonight had been a skills night.  Two flashes of emerald green caught Hermione’s eye, and she looked up to see Draco and Theo both staring down at her. Something about the mischievous looks in their eyes made her suck in her breath and bite down on her bottom lip. “Hey,” Theo said, giving her a thoroughly predatory smirk that only served to ramp her heart rate up even further.  “Oh my God’s Granger!” Pansy squealed, looking at them both in amusement. “Harry better look at me like that tonight, or I’ll be seriously put out!” “Uh, hi!” Hermione put down her quill, looking at Draco, who was regarding her with much the same expression as Theo.  “How’s the studying going?” Draco’s hair was windswept, and his cheeks were flushed red from the cold November wind.  “Good, thank you, I’ve just finished as it happens. How was training?”  “Perfect. I bested Potter for the snitch. He’s vowed that it’ll be the only time but, we’ll see. Oh look, here he is now.” Draco pulled the still struggling snitch out of his pocket and grinned as he examined it against the light to deliberately goad Harry. “We all get lucky once in a while, Malfoy.” Harry leaned down to kiss Pansy, his red robes falling open across the table as he moved, “don’t expect to get used to it.”  “Well done, Draco,” Hermione said. She held back a laugh, Draco and Harry’s identical, highly competitive natures never seemed to change.  “So,” Theo looked at her speculatively, “training’s over, but it’s a beautiful night. Fancy coming for a flight with us?” “Ummmm….” She looked at Harry in horror for a moment but all he did was grin as he leaned down to kiss Pansy. “Let me rephrase that.” Theo grinned, “you're coming with us. Ron’s already told us you don’t like flying, but I think we can possibly change your mind on that score.”   “I...I am?” the looks they both gave her caused her mouth to go suddenly dry. “You are. Yes.” Theo rolled up her finished essay and tucked it into her bag while Draco gathered up her quill and ink bottle. “Unless you really object, of course. But everyone else who is still part of the game is doing it, and there’s a very nice surprise waiting at the end of the flight.” “In that case, I don’t object,” she said quietly as Harry gave her a surprised smile.  “Good girl.” The heat in Theo’s gaze made her shiver. “Go and get some warm clothes, it’s chilly up there.”
  
  
  And indeed it was. Hermione's teeth were chattering as she stood on the quidditch pitch surrounded by the rest of the game’s players. “Who do you want to fly with?” Draco asked as Ginny stepped over Blaise’s firebolt beside them. Hermione watched with mild concern as Blaise settled into position behind Ginny then they both kicked off into the sky like a rocket. “Who is the steadier flyer?” “Steadier or better?” She rolled her eyes, “who is going to scare me less up there?” “Probably me.” Theo shrugged, “oh, come on, Draco, we all know you fly like the bloody wind. Of the pair of us I’ll go steadier.” Draco grinned as he gestured to Theo’s broom. “On you get then, beautiful.” Theo guided her into position then sat down behind her. He was still wearing his quidditch cloak and she was surprised when it magically stretched to wrap around her as well. “This has got an anti-wind charm built in. You won’t feel the cold if you keep it wrapped around you.” She nodded gratefully, gripping the broom handle until her knuckles went white. “Relax, baby, I’ve got you,” he murmured and she pressed back into him, slightly reassured by the feel of his strong arms either side of her.  She closed her eyes and tried not to shriek as they took off. The wind whistled through her ears and the ground fell away alarmingly fast underneath them. “You don’t like to fly then?” Theo asked as he banked around, laughing at Draco who streaked past them, looped the loop then passed them again in the opposite direction. She heard Ginny squeal as Blaise did the same thing and Hermione stared at them all in wonder as Blaise levelled out beside them.  “I’ve just had a few bad experiences, that’s all,” she said, thinking of the doomed Thestral ride she had shared with Kingsley Shacklebolt, then her, Harry and Ron’s terrifying flight to freedom on the back of a dragon. Theo nodded, flying smoothly despite the acrobatics going on around them. Draco, Blaise, and Ginny seemed to be trying to outdo each other with daring maneuvers and it made Hermione’s stomach clench uncomfortably just watching them. She noted with satisfaction that although Millie looked almost as uncomfortable on a broom as she felt, Ron seemed to be doing a very good job of looking after her. Parvati looked less comfortable. Every time Luna caught sight of something that interested her she leaned alarmingly off of the side of the broom causing a look of terror to cross Parvarti’s face as she adjusted their balance. Dean seemed to have noticed what was happening, he and Lavender were tracking Parvarti’s broom, as were Greg and Hannah, they were all clearly in position to catch Luna should the need arise.  “Where are we going?” Hermione looked down. It was dark but there was just enough moonlight to make out the Forbidden Forest far below.  “To a little spot we know. It’s not far now. We thought it would be a nice place to look at the stars since the sky’s beautifully clear tonight.” Theo replied.  Looking up, Hermione saw that he was right. Thousands of tiny sparkling stars lit the heavens. She was so enthralled with the display that she forgot her nerves, she tipped her face up to look into the eternal nothingness and felt Theo’s cheek brush gently against hers. He turned slightly to press a kiss against her cold skin and the intimacy of his gesture made her shiver.  They were flying a long way. Hermione felt the distant tingle of the Hogwarts boundary as they flew over the wards. A few minutes later, they approached a hill and Theo started to descend. The change of broom angle was unsettling, Theo tightened his arms protectively around her as she tensed. “I’ve got you,” he whispered and she tried her best to relax against him once more.  Her jaw dropped when they landed. “Oh my goodness, has this always been here?” she asked, stepping off the broom and attempting to rub some life back into her stiffened limbs. “Nope. Draco and I might have  accidentally  missed most of tonight's training to set this up.” “Not only did we set this up, but we also confounded Madam Hooch so she didn’t notice we were missing. And, I still beat Potter to the snitch!” Draco looked inordinately pleased with himself as Hermione walked closer to investigate. Five see-through domes stood on an area of flat ground. There was a heavy blanket laid out on the floor of each, snowy white bedding on top of the blankets, and as Draco waved his arm, an array of magical fairy lights sparkled into life. It was beautifully romantic, and Hermione was totally blown away by his and Theo's creativity. “What do you think?” Theo asked. “I think it’s incredible!” she answered truthfully as Ginny threw her arms around Theo, hugged him briefly in thanks, then followed Blaise into one of the domes.  “There’s a privacy charm on these, they're fully soundproof as well. Just saying.” Draco smirked in Blaise and Ginny’s direction. “Good thinking.” Theo chuckled as he picked up Draco’s broom and followed him to the nearest unclaimed dome. “This way then, my lady, after you.” Hermione stepped inside, smiling as yet another surprise washed pleasantly over her. The domes were heated. The flight had been lovely, but it was November in the Scottish Highlands and therefore the weather was freezing. The gentle warmth of the dome was a very welcome change. She watched with a smile as the lower panels of the enclosure gradually turned opaque. “This is amazing magic from both of you!” Theo grinned at her praise, kicked his boots off, then settled down on the soft duvet gesturing for her to join him. She leaned back into the fluffy bedding with a gasp. While the walls had given them privacy, the roof had stayed clear. The view of the moon and the stars was stunning. “How’s your astronomy?” Theo asked, leaning back beside her. “I can hold my own,” she said as both boys grinned.  “Top of the class then,” Theo stated and she didn’t argue. “Help us lesser mortals out will you please? What are we looking at up there?” She lay back, wriggling her toes into the warmth of the fleece blanket at the bottom of the bed as she pointed out various constellations. After a moment she noticed that while Theo was following her pointed directions, Draco was just watching her. She turned to face him, regarding him curiously. “I’m second in that class,” he smiled, “I know what’s up there. So right now I prefer to look at you two.” Hermione shivered as she moved fractionally closer to him. “Theo would be at the top of the class with us if he applied himself to his studies a little more too, you know?” “Oh?” Hermione turned to Theo as he raised an eyebrow and brushed the back of his hand down Hermione’s side making her shiver, “why don’t you?” He gave her a dazzling smile, “I'm academic where I want to be, it depends what the subject is. You won’t best me in Potions or Herbology, for example. I’m pretty good at Transfiguration and Care of Magical Creatures too. Then, there are certain extracurricular activities,” he stared at her from under heavily lidded eyes, “I particularly pride myself on my talents in those areas.” Hermione’s breath was a little shaky as she thought about how best to respond. “I didn’t know you liked Care of Magical Creatures or Herbology for that matter,” she said, settling for avoiding the obvious. “I’d guess that there's a few things you don't know about me, and a few that I don't know about you too. How about we learn a few things tonight?” Draco edged closer to Hermione’s other side. “Do you know what this does?” He held the bottle containing the color-changing liquid between his thumb and index finger and she shook her head. “It’s a potion that lets you see someone else’s fantasies. I chose it because it seemed a little unfair that we can both see your desires if you let us, of course, but you would struggle to see ours.” Hermione frowned in confusion as she took the bottle to examine it. The potion inside changed from turquoise to a shimmering purple as she looked at it.  “What’s in it and how does it work?” she asked suspiciously, knowing that she would never take anything that she didn’t fully understand.  “Haven’t the vaguest,” Theo admitted, looking supremely unconcerned. Seeing her frown of disapproval, he quickly backtracked. “I can find out if you like. Unless you happen to know Draco?” Draco merely shook his head with a smile. “Not a clue I’m afraid. But you’re right. We can find out. Anyway, she’s not refused it outright.” His smile turned into a grin as he watched Theo, “she just wants more information. I can work with that. I think in the meantime, we could tell her about one of our fantasies instead. What do you think?” “I think I like that idea a lot.” Theo’s grin was broad as Hermione turned to smile shyly at him, “Do you like dirty talk, Hermione?” with an audible swallow, she nodded slowly. “Good. Who’s fantasy would you like to hear?” She looked at both of them, unable to make up her mind. Theo nodded when she said nothing more. “You go first then Draco. We all know what direction my fantasies will take.” “I don’t!” Hermione said, sounding very slightly alarmed. It was never too far from her mind just who she was currently dating, and her lack of experience in the whole area did nothing to reassure her. Cho’s abrupt departure from the game due to her unease about Slytherin house was still fresh in her mind as well. “What direction will it take?” Draco just laughed, “Theo likes to be in charge in the bedroom. You’ve probably worked that out already, but his fantasies are a little on the spicier side. Me, I can go either way. In charge, not in charge, in the middle, it doesn't bother me.” Hermione nodded in relief. “Okay, I still want to hear one from both of you, but let's go with yours first then Draco.” He nodded, turning towards her, rolling onto his side then placing a hand on her stomach. “May I?” he asked. She nodded, and in response he lifted her jumper and started to trace delicate circles over her sensitive skin. “So, imagine you're lying here all on your own, looking up at the stars, tracing the constellations with a finger, like you were doing a minute ago. I’m outside watching you. You’re beautiful, all wild corkscrew curls and smooth olive skin…. Did I mention that you're naked, by the way?" His words caused her to shiver and he took advantage of her movement, tracing his fingers slightly lower. “You’re listening to a cd, the very one we picked out on Sunday in fact. I'll explain what's on that another time. For now, all you need to know is that it’s turning you on. You start to touch yourself. You pinch your nipples and it makes you moan. One of your hands slips lower, across here,” he drew a gentle line down her stomach, “may I?” she nodded again as he flicked the button of her jeans open, and Theo helped him to slide them down her legs.  “Your fingers slip down here.” He brushed his hand across the gusset of her panties, “you're wet, so very wet. Your fingers dip inside you, you groan and call out my name. I watch you for a moment, surprised and thinking I’d misheard. But I hadn't. You call out to me again, this time I answer you. You're embarrassed to be caught, but I slip into your dome to kiss you. You take my hand and guide it down to where you want it. It doesn’t take long for me to bring you off, and you come all over my fingers. When you're done, I ask you what you want and you tell me to take my trousers off. You tell me that you want me. You want me to fuck you, and so I do, and it’s perfect because you somehow know that I’ve wanted you for a very long time. You come looking into my eyes and it's real and, oh...” he broke off with a cough as Theo chuckled, “I'm getting a bit emotional now!” “Mate, you're such a softie,” Theo smiled. He regarded Draco with such obvious affection that Hermione’s eyes widened. She’d known that they were close, but the look Theo was giving him was more than mere closeness, It was almost a look of love. “Tell anyone that, either or you, and I’ll have to kill you both.” Draco sniffed.  “Somehow, Malfoy, you don’t scare me.” Theo leaned over to kiss him deeply. When they pulled apart, Draco rested his forehead against Theo’s, and they smiled tenderly at each other, once more shocking Hermione with the obvious depth of their feelings. “You know I like that side of your personality, if anyone ever made fun of it, then it would be me doing the killing. And if I make a promise like that, I  will  see it through.” Hermione shivered. Somehow Theo’s threat seemed a lot more menacing than anything she had ever heard Draco say. “That same level of protection goes for you too, Miss G. I seem to be getting inordinately fond of you very quickly as well.”  Hermione giggled as he diffused the intensity of the last few moments by pulling a goofy face. “I think I can keep your secret, Draco,” she said, “but I like that you have a softer side too. I honestly think that you should let it out more often.” She smiled as she turned rather shyly to Theo. “I also rather like this protective streak you seem to have as well. May I hear one of your fantasies now please?” Theo smiled, stroking her face gently. “I think I’ll start mine in the same place that Draco did, that is with you being here in this dome. We’d have agreed on everything beforehand mind, and you would have given your full consent. You need to understand that there's no way that any of this would happen if you didn't actively want it to. Are you with me so far, sweetheart?”  She nodded, curiosity and apprehension mixing with a overwhelming swirl of pure lust as she looked into his liquid blue eyes. “So, you're lying here, bringing yourself off, thinking you're all alone. But you're not. I'd be outside watching you, and just so we’re clear, we’d be pretending to not know each other well. In this fantasy, you’d know me from school, but that’s it. So, just when you were about to come, I'd try the door and find that you’d left it unlocked. I’d let myself in, you'd look up at me with frightened, lust drunk eyes. I'd tell you to carry on but not to come because your orgasm now belongs to me. I’d begin to tell you what to do and you’d whimper, and squirm as I did so. Pinch harder. Softer. Faster. Slower, that kind of thing.” He paused to brush a kiss over her lips and to check her reaction.  “You'd be begging me with your eyes to let you come, in fact you’d be about to defy me when I told you to wait because, well because you're feisty, and I like that about you. You’d want to know how far you could push me. So to show you that you couldn’t dominate me I'd take your hands in mine and put them up on the pillow. I’d use a sticking charm to keep them there, then I’d bend your knees and stick your feet to the bed as well. You’d groan, partly in frustration, partly because I made you just a little bit nervous. You'd still be on the edge of an orgasm but you wouldn’t be able to do anything about it now. You’d be completely at my mercy, and we’d both know it.” Theo paused to check in with her, “How are you dealing with this one so far, beautiful?” Her breath was shaky, and her words wouldn’t come. The image he was painting was so vivid. She wanted to experience it for real. It was edgy, slightly dangerous, and it was making her more turned on than she had ever been in her life. “Very well,” she gasped as he moved down the bed to lick a line around her belly button, right where Draco had been circling his fingers earlier. He blew on her skin gently, making her shiver as he moved back to his original position. “Next, I’d get myself undressed, slowly mind, and you’d watch me do it. My eyes would be full of desire as I looked at you. It would frustrate you still further when I didn’t touch you. I'd get down on my hands and knees to lick your hot, sweet cunt, and every time I did so you’d cry out. Then I’d back away to kiss your mouth instead, the taste of your juices on my tongue would drive you crazy. I’d tell you to beg me but you’d refuse, so I'd carry on slowly teasing you. You’d get to the point where you couldn’t stand it any more, you’d look at me then you’d finally beg. Please, Theo, as soon as you did that, I’d slide slowly inside you. You’d clench around me almost instantly, one thrust, two, then you’d come so hard you’d scream my name to the heavens. I’d fuck you through it and even as you came down, I’d carry on, and I’d take you right back up there again, harder and higher this time until you shattered into a million pieces all over my cock.” She whimpered, wondering if it was possible to have an orgasm just from listening to someone talk. “As we both settled, I’d unstick your hands and feet and you’d roll over, you’d want to be cross with me for tying you down and for withholding your orgasm, but you’d be so exhausted that you wouldn’t really have the energy to tell me off. So instead, we’d accept that we really did know each other and that it had all been preplanned, then we’d fall asleep right here, under the stars you’d been so diligently studying half an hour before.” When he stopped speaking she audible sighed. “What do you think of that one baby girl?”  She couldn’t speak. Theo had been observing her reactions carefully, as had Draco. They both knew the effect their spoken fantasies had had. “I….I think,” she was almost incoherent with need, “I think one of you needs to make good on your promises right now.” Theo laughed as he sat back on his haunches, gesturing for Draco to take over. “Fucking hell!” Draco muttered as he brushed his fingers against her core, making her moan, “I think she liked the ideas we’ve given her.” Theo just smirked, “that’s good to know. Next time I’ll give you a fantasy that involves Draco as well. I’ve got a lot of those tucked away.” Hermione bucked, writhing against Draco’s hand with a moan as he caressed her then slid his hand inside her panties, “What do you want beautiful, how far do you want me to go?”  Hermione made up her mind as she gazed into his soft grey eyes. “I don’t want to wait any longer. This is perfect tonight. You are both so perfect. I want to do everything tonight.” Draco nodded as Theo moaned softly beside them. Draco kissed her slowly then moved his body to the side. She felt Theo bring her panties down her legs, then crawl back up her body to sweep his tongue through her folds. He brought her closer and closer to release, his tongue dipping deeply inside her, then back out again as Draco continued to kiss her mouth. “Oh Gods!” she breathed as Draco pulled back, vanishing their remaining clothes with a spell. She could feel him, hard and unyielding against her, and she stiffened as Theo moved away to let Draco took his place.  “Relax, beautiful. I’ll never hurt you,” Draco said, as she gazed up at him. The tip of his hard length nudged against her, and she felt Theo’s fingers brush her nipple as his breath ghosted across her cheek. She turned to him, and he kissed her softly as Draco slid gently inside her. She winced at the sudden, sharp sting, Theo pulled away to whisper another spell, and the pain instantly vanished. Draco moved back to kiss her, giving her time for her body to adjust to his unfamiliar presence. “Tell me when you're ready and I'll start to move a little bit.” “I'm ready.” He pressed slowly up into her making her eyes widened in surprise. There was no pain now, just the somewhat strange sensation of being really, really full. He was gentle as he pulled out, and she whimpered, only to gasp as he pressed back inside her again. His rhythm was slow, and he waited until she was completely comfortable before starting to pick up the pace a little.  Draco grunted, closing his eyes as he tried to hold himself back, but she was ready. She tilted her hips, instinctively drawing him further in, then cried out as he thrust more deeply into her a few times and tipped her over the edge of oblivion. Two more slightly harder thrusts were all it took for him to join her, he finally collapsed down on top of her when he was totally spent. It took a few moments for her to calm and to realize what had happened, and when she opened her eyes, it was to find Theo smiling softly at her as he stroked Draco’s back. “You alright?” he asked, and she nodded as she smiled in return. “Yes, I’m very alright, thank you,” she said, feeling rather dazed and utterly boneless as she laid back against the soft bedding. Draco smiled too as he carefully withdrew himself. “You were amazing,” he said, stroking her mussed hair out of her face. “That was every bit as perfect as I always knew it would be.” He kissed her again, and she sighed, moving carefully onto her side as he laid the duvet over her, then beckoned Theo closer. One spell vanished Theo’s jeans and boxers and he quirked an amused eyebrow in response. He said nothing, just gasped as Draco took him into his mouth and started to suck him off.  Theo locked eyes with Hermione and she couldn’t look away. She glanced at Draco’s blonde head as he bobbed up and down, then looked back into Theo’s eyes. She saw the exact moment that he lost control. He tapped Draco gently on the shoulder to warn him that he was close, and Draco nodded. “Really Malfoy?" Theo gasped as Draco nodded once more. "You’re so fucking good-” the rest of his words were lost in a grunt as he pushed Draco’s head firmly down. Hermione’s eyes bulged wide at the erotic sight and when Theo released Draco, he swallowed, gulped in a couple of hurried breaths then turned to look at Hermione with a grin. “Kiss me?” he asked, giving her a wink, and curiosity overrode her exhaustion. She leaned forwards to press her lips to his. Draco chuckled as he pulled her closer and pushed for entry to her mouth. She yielded to him straight away, tasting Theo’s release on his tongue.  Theo groaned at the sight as he flopped backward onto the bed. “You two are officially my favorite people in the entire fucking world. You know that?” he tugged Hermione towards him and she settled down with him on one side and Draco pressed up against her other side. Snuggled together like that, all three of them fell asleep before they remembered where they were and that they really should get back to Hogwarts before the castle started to wake up in the morning.
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione woke up wondering why she felt so hot. She was also unable to move, and as she opened her eyes, the reason for both problems became apparent. She was sandwiched tightly between Draco and Theo in the magical dome with the duvet tucked snugly over them all. Draco was holding her tightly from behind, while Theo’s back was pressed firmly against her front. Both of them were snoring softly. She blinked the sleep out of her eyes, wanting to change position but being unwilling to wake either of them by moving just yet. It was still dark, although the very first glow of predawn was glimmering in the sky to the east, and the stars that had sparkled so beautifully above the dome in the night were now starting to fade.  A dull ache between her legs reminded her of what else had happened last night. She smiled, remembering the perfect evening. She shifted slightly, suddenly desperate for the toilet and wondering how best to extract herself from the bed. She was thirsty too, and worry was beginning to gnaw at the pit of her stomach. Had they meant to spend all night here? What if the teachers noticed that they were all missing, and despite their eighth year privileges, they were in trouble when they got back to the castle? She carefully slid up the bed, trying not to wake either of the boys, but Draco’s hand tightened on her arm, making her pause. “Sorry,” she whispered as he opened bleary eyes, “I need a wee.” She stepped into her shoes then wrapped one of the boy’s quidditch robes around herself before venturing outside. It was freezing. Thick white frost covered the ground, and icy leaves crunched noisily under her feet as she made her way towards the trees. When she was done, she paused, checking that she was still wrapped up decently as Blaise grinned at her from the door of his and Ginny’s dome. “Isn’t that the wrong color for you? Or are you switching allegiances now?” he asked. She looked down at the emerald green robes with a laugh. “Never. I’m Gryffindor till I die. Unfortunately I don’t have one of these robes, though. They’re so warm!” “They are, yes. Did you have a good night?” she nodded, blushing at the way Blaise laughed.  “That good, huh? Well, I wish you luck in getting Theo back to the castle in time for breakfast. He’s not really a morning person.” “And you are?” she blinked in the growing dawn light. He was already dressed and looked to have been tidying up when she had interrupted him. “It’s the best time of day. Ginny thoroughly disagrees with me, though.” “She would!” Hermione knew from experience how grumpy Ginny could be before mid-morning. “Don’t take it personally. She hates the whole world before about ten o’clock!” “Ditto for Theo. Best of luck!” Hermione grinned as she opened the door and slipped back inside her dome. “Morning beautiful,” Draco was sitting up watching her as she hovered awkwardly by the door, “Who on earth were you talking to at this time? Wait, no, the only one who’d be bright and breezy at this hour would be Blaise. Am I right?” she nodded with a smile. “Did you have the hood up on that robe while you were chatting? just out of interest?” “No, why?” she frowned as she wondered what to do. She was naked under the cloak, and Draco was watching her. If she opened the robe to get dressed, he would see everything, and she was still feeling a little shy. Draco smirked, “I’ve just never seen hair that screams I spent all night shagging better than yours does right now.” “Oh no!” she reached up to smooth it down with a sigh. It felt like a bird’s nest under her fingers. “No wonder Blaise had such a twinkle in his eye!” “Ah well, I’d wager that he and Ginny did a lot more than we did last night anyhow. Never mind. Morning sleepyhead!” Draco turned to grin at Theo, who had just prised one eye open and was glaring at them both.  “Blaise, uh, mentioned that Theo’s not really a morning person,” Hermione said. Draco laughed as Theo groaned, stuck the pillow over his head and mumbled about that being a lie.  Draco pushed the covers back, smacked Theo loudly on his naked bum, then stood up. He stretched, starting to look for his clothes as Hermione did the same. Ten minutes later, the pair of them were ready, but Theo still hadn’t moved. Draco rolled his eyes and finally sent a stinging hex at him, all while grumbling about missing breakfast.  Once Theo was up, it only took a couple of minutes to pack the domes away magically. Hannah and Greg had already left, as had Parvati and Luna, with Dean and Lavender sticking close to their tails. Ginny was still grumbling sleepily as Blaise kicked off, and Hermione found she couldn’t say no to Draco when he asked her to fly back to the castle on his broom. “Okay, but no acrobatics, please,“ she said as she stepped apprehensively over the hovering Firebolt. “None,” he promised, as Theo soared up into the sky in front of them.  She snuggled backward into Draco’s cloak feeling the difference in his flying as soon as he took off. While Theo felt relatively safe in the air, Draco was much more agile and precise. Flying with him felt just as terrifying as flying with Harry did. However, she reasoned, he had promised not to drop her, and it seemed to be the time for trying new things. “What about just a little bit?” she asked tentatively after a few minutes. “A little bit of what?” Draco asked over her shoulder, “A little bit of, you know, fancy flying?” she asked, feeling his smile widen against her cheek.  “How fancy?” “Fancy-ish. Just promise you won’t drop me? I don’t know how the balance thing works yet.” “I promise I won’t drop you. Relax into my chest.” She did as he asked, tensing slightly as he pulled the broom handle up to gain height. The ground fell away sharply and she fought every instinct she had to try to stay relaxed. He wheeled around, flying higher still, then changed direction smoothly. Hermione felt like a bird. Flying so high was incredible, the wind whipped tears from her eyes as they flew against the sun, higher and higher, circling around and swooping through the morning like an eagle. “Do you feel it now?” Draco asked, and she nodded, suddenly feeling rather emotional. “This is why I love to fly. We’re higher than the birds. No one can reach you up here. Even the darkness can’t catch you if you fly fast enough.” She had the feeling there was more to that statement than just casual words, and she was sad when he started to slowly spiral back down. “Yes. I feel it.” She nodded, suddenly feeling very vulnerable as he took one hand off the broom handle to wrap around her. "I've got you," he whispered as he kissed her on the cheek then lazily flew back down to land on the quidditch pitch. 
  
  
 Hermione still felt exhilarated as she kissed Draco goodbye in the common room then let herself into the girl’s bedroom. She paused to lean back against the door, close her eyes, and relive the swooping feeling of flying. As she let out a slow breath, she registered that Lavender and Parvati’s chatter had abruptly stopped, and the room was now silent. She opened her eyes to see them both standing beside her bed, frozen with what looked like indecision. “What’s wrong?” she asked. “Umm…..” both girls exchanged worried glances then Parvarti stepped forwards looking nervous. “We just found this. It was pinned to your curtains when we walked in.” She held a piece of parchment in her hands, and Hermione looked at it curiously. What she saw made the bottom drop out of her stomach. She gasped, clapping a hand over her mouth as she read the three words scrawled across the parchment in scruffy writing- "Death Eater's Whore." “We don’t…. I mean…. It was just there. We just found it!” Lavender cried desperately. “We don’t think that way!” Parvati said as if needing reassurance that Hermione didn’t blame them for the incident. “We didn’t put it there. It wasn’t from us!” Hermione stared at the parchment, all feelings of exhilaration and afterglow fading abruptly as reality came crashing back in. Cho’s departure from the game and Ginny’s assessment of her motives flashed through her mind once more. “I know you don’t think that way,” she said as reassuringly as possible, then she grabbed the parchment out if Pavarti's hand, turned on her heel, spun around, and headed to the showers before they could see her crumble. She felt terrible that entire day. By the time evening came, Ron had sensed that something was wrong. He had been watching her in concern all afternoon, and had clearly reached the end of his ability to remain quiet. He cornered her in the common room after dinner, before steering her boldly into the Gryffindor boy’s dormitory. Harry was lying on his bed idly flicking through a quidditch magazine when Ron cleared his throat, beckoned him over, and sat Hermione down on his bed. Harry raised his eyebrows as he regarded them both quizzically. “Out with it ‘Mione. What did that blonde git do?” Ron practically growled his displeasure at seeing her so upset, and despite her inner turmoil she smiled softly. His protective familiarity was incredibly reassuring. She felt her bottom lip tremble as she pulled out the offending piece of parchment. “It wasn’t Draco. Or Theo,” she admitted, "they were both perfect. It’s this.” She handed the parchment to Harry, and both he and Ron looked at it in horror.  “What in the bloody hell?!” Ron said, leaping up off the bed as if the parchment had bitten him, “Have you shown your two, I can’t call Malfoy your boyfriend yet ‘Mione, I’m trying, honestly, I’m trying, but still! Have you shown this to…. them?” She shook her head while wiping away a tear. Everything suddenly felt a bit too much for her to bear. She leaned sideways into Harry as she cried, feeling Ron stroke her back reassuringly while he stared at the note as if he could destroy it with the force of his glare alone.  She wasn't sure how long they sat like that, but the next thing she was aware of was the bed hangings being yanked open and Pansy staring at them in shocked disbelief. “Hey, Pans,” Harry said as Hermione straightened up to wipe her eyes. “Wait a sec!” Harry shouted as Pansy spun on her heel and marched furiously away.  “You need to show this to Draco and Theo,” Ron said as Harry caught up with Pansy, and their furious whispers suddenly abated. There was a moment of quiet, then Pansy hurried back to the bed.  “What’s up, Granger?” Pansy asked, seeing her tear streaked face and jumping up onto the bed beside her.  Ron passed Pansy the note and her face contorted into a scowl as she read it. She snatched it furiously out of Ron’s hand and marched out of the dormitory into the packed common room before anyone could stop her. “Alright, Listen up!” she shouted, abruptly cutting through the idle chatter. “I have a question, and I want an answer.” She glared around the room as every person in it stared at her in confusion. She held up the parchment to a collective intake of breath. “Which lowlife, which absolute, fucked up, cockwombling fucktard left this on Hermione’s bed hangings last night?” Harry nudged Hermione forwards out of the boy’s dorms as Pansy held the room captive. “That girl saved the whole fucking wizarding world, and this? This is the way you repay her. Whoever did this is a wanker. I want whoever did it to step forward, get on their hands and knees in front of her and grovel out an apology right now. And if Hermione’s got any sense, she’ll kick you in the face while you're down there. Well? Has anyone got anything to say for themselves?!” Nobody moved a muscle, until to Hermione’s absolute amazement Hannah Abbott stood up rather shakily. “I don’t know who did it,” Hannah said in a small voice, “so I can't help there, but I got one of those notes on my bed hangings too.” 
  
  

  
  
Worse than the shock of getting the actual note was Draco’s reaction to the whole situation. He and Theo had been out of the common room during Pansy’s tirade, but when they returned and Hermione showed them the note, Draco blamed himself for the whole thing.  “Malfoy, stop being a dick.” Greg said quietly as Draco stood up ready to storm away in a fit of self hatred, and to Hermione’s surprise Draco listened to him. “Dorms,” Greg said, fixing him with a look that Hermione couldn’t quite read. Draco merely nodded as he followed them all inside the Slytherin boy’s bedroom. “You need to get a grip on this, Draco,” Greg said, sitting down on the nearest bed and holding out his own marked left arm, “You, me, we’re just the same. I’m not running from it and neither should you be.” He looked up as the door opened and Blaise blinked at them all in surprise, “I’m really hoping you lot aren’t planning an orgy on my bed, not without me involved anyway,” he smiled, taking in their tense faces. “Alright, who sent the notes? Who do we need to curse?” “That’s just it. We don’t know,” Hermione said, shaking her head as there was another knock at the door.  Theo opened it with his wand to reveal Harry and Ron standing in the doorway. “If you’re looking for somewhere to discuss this properly, I just spoke to Sirius. We’re welcome at Grimmauld. Remus is good at piecing together clues as well, we might get something helpful from them.” “Grimmauld Place?” Theo asked with a grin, “I’ve always wanted to see inside that house. It’s the stuff of legends! Come on, let’s go!”  It wasn’t a small group that went through the floo either. Harry went first, taking a somewhat unsure Pansy with him, Ron followed with Millie, Ginny with Blaise, then Hannah and Greg, and finally, Hermione and Theo with Draco supposedly following. As they landed in the kitchen, Hermione realized that Draco hadn’t followed after all, so she abruptly abandoned Theo to go back for him. When he finally set foot into the kitchen, he looked up at Sirius with a defeated sigh while Sirius just stared passively back.  Sirius and Remus had obviously been busy, having been warned they were coming. There were various nibbles piled haphazardly on the table, and Sirius turned away from Draco to busy himself pouring hefty measures of Firewhisky for anyone who wanted them. Remus jumped up from his chair as Hermione greeted him. “Are you okay?” he asked, searching her face with a worried look.  “I am now, yes.” She nodded as she set the offending piece of parchment down on the large kitchen table. Hannah added her similar one and everyone stared at the notes in disgust.  “Have we got any ideas as to who's behind this?” Sirius asked, still handing out glasses and rolling his eyes when Hermione asked for a measure of lemonade in hers. “Anyone else want to dilute vintage Ogden’s?” he asked, muttering about sacrilege as he added half a glass of mixer to Hermione, Millie, and Hannah’s glasses.  “I’ve got no idea at all, I’m afraid,” Hannah admitted, still looking upset.  Remus ran his wand over Hermione's note, searching for clues to the writer's identity as the others started devouring the snacks. “And there was nothing left on your curtains, Ginny?” “Nope," Ginny shook her head. “But I’d have been surprised if there was. That would mean that whoever did this got into Gryffindor Tower too. Remember I’m supposed to sleep up there still, aren’t I?” She looked over at Blaise, but he just squeezed her hand with a faint smile.  “Thereby insinuating that you don’t currently?” Sirius asked. Ginny grinned in reply, “um, not for a while, no.” Sirius returned her smile with a hint of concern in his eyes, “I hope you’re looking after this one,” he said to Blaise as he ruffled Ginny’s hair affectionately, “She’s quite special, you know. Anyway,” he nodded as Blaise confirmed that Ginny was special to him as well, “it’s easy enough to get into Gryffindor Tower if you're determined and you have enough nerve. Is there a chance that a note is there and you just haven’t seen it yet?” he asked.  “No,” Blaise confirmed. “We went up to check. There was nothing on my bed either. I think the writer was selective. Draco and Greg were marked Death Eaters, Theo and I weren’t, although both of us could be easily linked to the cause,  but I think that’s why only Hermione and Hannah received the notes.” Remus nodded. “So it’s someone who knows their stuff then? Or is that fact common knowledge?” “I’d say it’s fairly common,” Blaise agreed, “more so about me. Theo has an interesting tattoo on his left arm that could be mistaken for a Dark Mark if you weren’t looking properly. He seems to enjoy courting the controversy it causes.” “What?” Theo threw back the rest of his drink as Sirius looked away to hide his amusement, “courting controversy, me? I don’t know what you mean,” he retorted sarcastically. “It wouldn’t matter anyway,” Blaise raised a perfectly groomed eyebrow in Theo’s direction, as Pansy snorted with laughter. “You're with Hermione too, so one note would cover both you and Draco and get its point across nicely.” “I’m not sure which is the most offensive part of the whole thing, to be honest,” Remus frowned, “referring to the boys as Death Eaters or the girls as whores.” “The slur at the girls!” Pansy said indignantly as Harry nodded his agreement. “I swear quite a lot if I’m honest, but I would never use an indefensible word like that. There are some words you just don’t say!!” “I’d say both slurs were meant to be equally upsetting,” Greg said, speaking for the first time as he took Hannah’s hand. “They're very specifically targeted too, which makes me think that the writer knows us all quite well. Both slurs would upset Draco. Theo and I wouldn’t care about being called Death Eaters, but both of us would simply kill whoever said that about Hermione and Hannah. I was what I was. I can’t change that, and it doesn’t bother me like it bothers Draco. So this is less about me and more about Hannah for us. I didn’t say anything in front of other people because my record goes against me, but I’m not just standing for this. People can say what they like about me, and I probably deserve it, but they’re not dragging Hannah into anything.” “Alright mate,” Theo put a hand on his shoulder, “Well said. We’re not just standing for it either. I’m taking it the same way you are. I couldn’t give a flying fuck about the Death Eater slur, but Draco could, and I’m protective of him. I’m also incensed that someone would say this about Hermione. So I feel aggrieved on both of their behalves. So,” he looked around the room, noting that both Sirius and Remus were giving him and Greg approving if rather surprised smiles, “Greg, you and I both have fiery tempers. Is it someone trying to provoke the pair of us?” Hermione glanced at Draco, who was twisting the signet ring he wore on his finger almost compulsively while avoiding everyone's eyes. “You can add me into that too because whoever they are, they insulted my girlfriend. And difficulties in this area aside, I’m not just taking that lying down.” “Have you thought that it might be someone who wants you for themselves and therefore wants to scare the girls away, or that it’s just simply someone with a grudge against the girls?” Harry asked. “For what reason would someone want us?” Draco asked in confusion, but Blaise smirked. “Oh, come on, Malfoy. You know you're highly eligible, particularly to someone interested in all the pureblood nonsense. Theo and Greg are coveted too in that regard. If whoever wrote this wants one of you and supports the cause, then they stand much more of a chance with you if they’ve chased the girls off, don’t they? Neither Hermione nor Hannah are shining beacons for the dark arts. I hope you don’t mind me saying so, girls?” “Actually,” Remus leaned back in his chair as Hermione frowned, “all of your theories make a lot of sense. Have you got anyone in mind as a suspect?” “Unfortunately not,” Blaise admitted as Sirius went round with the bottle topping up glasses again. “Thanks.” “I think it’s more likely to be someone who feels like Cho does. Oh, I don’t think it’s her for one moment. She’s far too meek to do something like this, but maybe someone who shares her sentiments,” Hermione said.  “Which would be what, half the bloody school?” Draco asked, still looking rather skeptical. “Whichever way we look at things, we haven't ruled anyone out. It’s either someone who likes us or someone who doesn't.” Sirius laughed. “It's good being notorious, isn't it? Welcome to my world!” He lifted his glass in a toast, and Theo and Greg clinked their glasses with him.  “Oh, come on, grumpy guts, cheer up.” Theo nudged Draco who rolled his eyes. “And what about you two?” Theo asked, turning to Hermione and Hannah. “How do you feel about it all?” “Annoyed!” Hermione snapped. “Initially, I was shocked and hurt, really hurt, both on my own behalf and yours, but now I’m just pissed off. How bloody dare they do this to all of us?” “Exactly!” Hannah agreed. “I feel the same.” Remus nodded. “Well, in that case, I think the thing to do is to carry on as normal, girls. If you get any more notes, then we can change tacks. Just stay alert and lets see what happens next. If anything does,” Remus said. “I think between us we can probably pull a few decent hexes together should the need arise.” His eyes twinkled as he looked around the room, “don’t you?”   There was a chorus of approval and glass clinking, and even Draco smiled as talk turned back to other, much more pleasant things. 
  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    By Friday evening, Hermione had fully come to terms with the offensive notes she and Hannah had received. She had felt trapped inside a whirlwind of emotions all day. Hurt, embarrassment, shame, self-righteous anger, and protective fury had all chased themselves in circles inside her brain until she had finally reached acceptance, and then a burning curiosity to find out who had been behind the hostile acts. By the time she was marching back and forth in the corridor outside of the Room of Requirement for their weekly planned girl’s night, she had settled on just one thing. She was going to find out who was behind the vile slurs and bring them to justice.  The notes’ personal nature didn’t seem to be bothering Theo in the slightest, other than keeping a protective eye on her and Draco, he seemed to be just as cheerful as usual. If Hermione had noticed anything different about him at all, it was the extra spark of defiance that now shone in his blue eyes. It was as if by raising his challenge to the world at large, he hoped to provoke a reaction from the note writer in return.  Draco was the complete opposite, however. It had taken him until mid-afternoon to stop avoiding everyone, including Hermione, and to start behaving normally again. She suspected that his change in attitude had resulted from Greg and Blaise cornering him after Transfiguration, but since Professor McGonagall had held her back to discuss the New Year's Eve Gala, she had missed their entire conversation and therefore didn’t know what had been said to lift his despair. Hermione smiled, finding herself pleasantly surprised by what she had seen of Greg over the past two days. He didn't usually have a lot to say, but when he did speak, his words were intelligent. He also seemed to be one of the very few people that Draco truly listened to. When Greg told Draco to stop beating himself up about the notes, Draco not only took his words to heart but acted on them too.  She took a deep breath to ground herself back into the present, opened the now visible door, then stepped into the Room of Requirement. The layout inside was identical to how it had been the previous week. The divide between the two halves of the room was back, and the raucous shouts of laughter from the boy’s side reminded her that she was rather late. She had lost track of time in the library while finishing her homework and had hurried back to find the common room almost deserted save for a large group of Ravenclaws in the corner. While stopping to reorganize her bulging book bag on a nearby table, she had overheard snippets of a rather incriminating conversation between two of Cho Chang’s friends. Hermione had lingered out of sight for a while to listen further, and the girl’s opinions had proved rather eye-opening. These particular girls hadn't been the ones who had left the notes, but they made it clear that they fully supported whoever had. Hermione had just about managed to hold her temper back and to only hex them discreetly. She had smirked as she’d left the common room thoroughly pleased with her retaliation spellwork. She had jinxed the essays the girls had been working on to appear unreadable to any of their teachers. The ink would be perfectly visible to the two girls themselves so that they would hand their essays in as usual, but to the professor who tried to read them, they would appear as nothing more than blank sheets of parchment bearing the student’s names.  She was still smiling in satisfaction as she hugged Ginny hello and accepted a glass of prosecco from Pansy. “You're late, Miss G! Also, we need in-for-ma-tion from you.” Ginny grinned, drawing the word out with an eyebrow wiggle. “Tell us what happened in the domes! We were distracted by the notes yesterday, but you can’t escape any longer!” Hermione grinned, she had been expecting this very question, and for once, she was more or less ready to discuss it. She sipped her drink, feeling the bubbles pop with a gentle fizz on her tongue as she looked up. Ginny, Pansy, Luna, Parvati, Lavender, Millie, Daphne, and Hannah were all gazing at her expectantly. “Why do I have to go first?” she laughed. “I promise I will tell you, but what about some of you going first to ease me in? You’re all much better at this than me, after all. How were all of your nights?” “Well, Daph and myself didn’t go, so we’re out of the storytelling, I'm afraid. Although, I will tell you  exactly what Harry and I got up to in his bed instead if you like?” Pansy volunteered. Ginny clapped her hands as Lavender gave a squeal of encouragement, and by the time Pansy was through with her vivid descriptions, Hermione needed a top up of prosecco to settle her shredded nerves. Ginny’s stories from her night in the domes with Blaise were equally wild, although slightly less eye watering. Hermione still found it a little uncomfortable to hear about Harry in such a sexual way, although some of Pansy’s descriptions were causing her to look at him in a rather different light these days. Ginny clearly felt the same way when it came to Ron. She grimaced as Millie smiled shyly then recounted losing her virginity to him under the stars. After the first few sentences, Ginny managed to unstick her fingers from her ears, unscrew her eyes, smile, and contribute, albeit much more modestly, to the conversation and by the end of Millie’s dreamy storytelling, Ginny looked slightly proud of her brother’s very gentlemanly handling of a rather delicate experience. Hannah’s story easily got the most oooohs and ahhhhs of the night. She told how Greg had brought his guitar along with them and had taught her how to play a few chords, then they had gone for a midnight walk under the glittering Milky Way and finally spent the night cuddled up snugly against each other in bed. Lavender, by contrast, had discovered a serious problem with her and Dean’s fledgling relationship. He had chosen that night to confess a huge secret which Lavender categorically refused to divulge but had resulted in them sitting up chatting until two in the morning and then falling asleep platonically next to each other. Hermione smiled in satisfaction, she would never say anything in the group without permission, but she guessed that Dean had finally told Lavender that he was gay. While this obviously presented a problem for Lavender from the game’s romantic point of view it wasn’t at all surprising. Hermione knew that it had long been rumored, and she was glad that Dean was finally coming to terms with his sexuality.  All heads turned to Luna and Parvarti next, but nobody got very far past Luna’s benign smiles and Parvati’s deep blushes, so after some gentle but totally ineffective probing, they all moved on. “Alright, Hermione.” Pansy picked up a new bottle of prosecco, popped the cork, then topped off all of their glasses, “out with it! What happened? Which one did you shag?” She grinned wickedly as she paused, “or was it both of them?” Hermione blushed. “Draco,” she said, wincing as the room exploded with excitable squeals.  “Tell us, tell us, tell us!!” Ginny shuffled forwards in her seat, listening eagerly as Hermione recounted what had happened.  When she was finished, every single person in the room was smiling. “That sounds so perfect,” Parvarti said dreamily. Hermione nodded, suddenly feeling rather emotional. “So, I didn't ask any of you before because I wanted to find out for myself,” she began rather haltingly, “and from my limited experience, the other night was absolutely perfect, but I'm guessing from what you've all said that Draco and Theo are both rather... umm... talented in that area?” “Talented?!” Pansy screeched, “good grief, girl. If I didn’t have Harry right now, I’d be madly jealous of you! Yes. They’re both excellent indeed. It was your first time, tell me, did it hurt in any way? was anything awkward?” “Nope. It was perfect.” Hermione answered with a smile. “There you go then.”  Ginny nodded. “I’d say that Blaise is the best I’ve ever had, but Draco comes a close second for me.” Ginny grinned. He’s just so adorable. Everyone thinks he’s this tough, heartless bad boy, when in fact, he’s a little sweetpea.” “Whereas everyone thinks Theo’s a cheeky little sweetpea, and in fact, he’s the one who’s a tough, semi heartless bad boy,” Pansy agreed with a laugh.  “Yes,” Hermione nodded dreamily. “I think I had their personalities the wrong way round in my mind too.” She took a deep breath before asking the question that she wouldn’t have asked had she not been two and a half glasses of prosecco into the evening, “so what’s it like to have Theo, you know, like that?” “Amazing,” Daphne said, smiling dreamily. “He’s the best.” “Ah.” Millie turned to look at Daphne in surprise, “so you’ve forgiven him for dumping Tracy, then have you?” “What?” Hermione asked in concern, “When was he with Tracy?” Millie frowned. “Directly before this game. She’s always liked him from afar, and I don’t quite know what happened, but they got it together, then this game came to light and he dropped her like a stone. She was heartbroken for a while, but I think she’s over it now. She’s started seeing that Hufflepuff guy, Justin... somebody, and she seems happy with him now, so I guess we can just about forgive Theo for hurting her.” “Tracy and Theo would never have worked out long term anyway though,” Daphne said. “She’s too quiet for him, and he’s too showy offy for her. Don’t worry about it Hermione, it all happened well before you came along. We were cross with him over it because Tracy is a good friend, and he hurt her, but we’re all good now.” Daphne smoothed her long blonde hair back and fixed Hermione with her emerald green eyes. “I believe you wanted to know what he’s like in bed?” Hermione tucked this latest, slightly alarming piece of information away to fully process later and nodded as Daphne smiled. “So…. it’s quite possible for that boy to just talk you into an orgasm-” “Oh, I know!” Hermione widened her eyes in shock at what she had let slip then clapped her hand over her mouth.  “And then,” Pansy said as everyone laughed, “before you’ve properly come down from the first one, he’ll just use his fingers or his tongue to shove you straight back up there again, and that’s before you even get near his-” “And before Draco even gets a look in, Merlin, if I had the two of them together, I think I’d just about die,” Daphne finished, interrupting with a giggle. “I practically did,” Pansy admitted.  Ginny smiled wickedly as she tossed her impossibly long hair back. “Do you think partner swapping comes up as one of the rounds in this game? Or what about foursomes? Do you think Blaise would let me add those two into our-” “Nooooooo!!” Hermione shouted, and everyone laughed harder as Lavender topped up their glasses yet again. “Come on then, Ginny, I can’t believe you’ve slept with Draco in the past, and I only found out about it last week. Spill the beans yourself, madam!” Hermione said. She tucked a leg underneath her bottom to listen as Ginny launched into yet another very lurid tale of her and Draco’s past encounters.
  
  

  
  
“Alright, you lot, this is becoming a habit now,” Sirius said over the seemingly never ending roar of the floo. He grinned at Millicent, who had just landed in the kitchen with Ron, while Remus put a handful of vials of hangover potion onto the scrubbed table then started pulling more food out of the fridge.  “You can’t really complain though, Pads,” Remus said mildly, “do you remember what you said to them all before they went back to school this September?” “Remind me, Moony, I’ve been asleep since then, I’ve probably forgotten.” “You told them to enjoy themselves this year. You said they should let their hair down and enjoy being young with no life threatening distractions for once. Now you're paying for that remark in hangover potions, bacon sandwiches, and first aid.” “I’ll bring you some of our potion stash.” Theo grinned from his seat at the table, “we’ve got plenty tucked away in our dorms.” “A sensible thing to keep on hand.” Sirius nodded his approval then raised an eyebrow as Harry and Pansy stumbled out of the floo. Harry grabbed two vials of potion, passed one to Pansy, and they both downed them before sitting down without a word. “How were your respective nights?” Hermione blushed at the memory of the past evening’s conversations, but Ginny just smirked. “Ours was very enlightening. Wasn’t it Miss G?” “I’m not answering.” Hermione covered her face in her hands, blushed even deeper, and groaned as Draco stroked her arm reassuringly. “Any more awful notes?” Remus asked, looking rather pale as he put several pans on the stove.  “No. Although I did hear something interesting yesterday,” Hermione said, starting to recount what she had overheard in the common room and how she had gotten back at the girls who had been gossiping. When she was done she turned to high five Pansy, who was looking significantly brighter now that her hangover potion was starting to work. “Are you sure you were sorted into the right house, Hermione? That’s a very sneaky hex. I’m proud of you.” Millie said. “Gryffindor’s can be sneaky if we need to be too,” Sirius asserted, ruffling Hermione’s already untidy hair. He pulled out a chair, guided a still pale and rather unsteady looking Remus away from the cooker and pushed him down into it. “Well done, Kitten. Just make sure they don't find out who did it.” “That's the beauty of that particular hex,” Draco said, also sounding rather proud while he looked uncertainly at Remus. “They can’t find out who did it because they won't know that the parchment is hexed until they hand it in, and by then, it’s far too late to know when it was done. Would you like a hand cooking, Ron?” “Uh…. yes, please,” Ron paused halfway through cracking eggs into the pan that Remus had abandoned, and turned to stare at Draco in surprise. Remus handed Draco the bread, and they both watched him put several slices into the toaster.  “Thank you. Otherwise, it would have fallen to Sirius to help, and it’s never a good idea to let him near the cooking,” Remus said with a nod of approval. “That's a Black family trait, I'm afraid,” Draco nodded, as Sirius sniffed in amusement and put a hand to Remus’s forehead as if to take his temperature. “My mother is the same. Now happily, it’s not a Malfoy one, say what you like about my Father, in fact I’d agree with most of it, but he’s an excellent cook.” Hermione was glad that she wasn’t the only one who snorted with laughter at that statement. She caught Ginny’s eye, and her amusement only intensified. She knew they were both imagining the same thing, Lucius Malfoy with an apron on in the kitchen. It was rather a disconcerting image for that time in the morning. “Actually, I agree,” Theo said with a grin, as Blaise and Pansy both nodded in confirmation. “As unexpected as it may sound, Lucius is an outstanding chef.” Sirius took a full minute to recover from that statement too. He nodded his thanks to Draco as he put the butter on the side, then turned his attention back to Remus. “Are you okay, Remus?” Hermione frowned, running through moon cycles in her head, “you look a bit... peaky.” “It’s the full moon tonight,” Sirius answered stoically as a visible ripple of tension passed through the kitchen. “Now look,” Sirius stood up, his shoulders strong and his expression haughty, “we might as well get it all out in the open, mightn’t we? It  is the full moon, you all know what Remus is, and if you're all going to be coming round here more often, then you need to get used to hearing us talk about it. It’s not a big deal to us, and if it is to you, well, there's the floo.” He held the pot of floo powder out defiantly as Remus stared intently at his hands.   To Hermione’s surprise, Pansy merely nodded her acceptance, and Theo held out his hand to Remus. “Gotcha. Friends?” Theo asked. Remus nodded, looking thoroughly shocked. He shook first Theo, then Draco, and then Blaise’s hands. Once the boys were done, Ginny threw her arms around him and hugged him tightly. Hermione did the same, Millie smiled, and after a moment of uncertainty, Pansy held out her hand too. “Well, that's’ that then.” Sirius put down the pot of floo powder and looked around the room slightly less aggressively. “No more acting like silly buggers if one of us mentions it from now on, please.” “Thank you for that.” Hermione heard Harry say, and she smiled at Pansy’s answering nod. Although Pansy was still looking wary, she was clearly trying her best. Hermione was impressed with her commitment to Harry, most pureblood children were brought up to fear werewolves, and Pansy’s new open mindedness was as welcome as it was surprising. After they had all eaten and sat around idly chatting for an hour or so, Harry, Pansy, Ginny, Blaise, Ron, and Millie all floo’d back to Hogwarts in a somewhat panicked attempt to at least start their mountains of homework, while Hermione, Draco, and Theo opted to spend most of the remaining day at Grimmauld Place.  Draco, Hermione had discovered, was almost as diligent at studying as she was, and they had both completed all of their assignments with plenty of time to spare. In contrast, Theo simply didn't care about his schoolwork unless it was for one of the subjects he liked, namely Potions, Herbology, or Care of Magical Creatures. He frowned dismissively at the mention of his unfinished essays shrugged off Hermione’s worries, and instead accepted Sirius’ offer of a walk into one of muggle London’s parks.  The beautiful Autumn weather made her glad that both he and Sirius had talked her into going out. They spent a perfect afternoon kicking through piles of crunchy, fallen leaves and enjoying the last few rays of sunshine before the weather turned truly dreadful for the winter. Remus seemed to perk up in the sunshine too, and by the time they all returned home, he was feeling a little better. “I’m going to bed for a bit,” he admitted once they were all settled around the table, warming their hands on hot mugs of cocoa, “I'll be having a difficult night, and I could do with the extra sleep right now. I'll’ see you when it's all over. And,” he paused, turning to Draco and Theo, “thank you both for the acceptance you showed me earlier. It means a lot.” “No problem.” Theo grinned cheerfully, “you were the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher we ever had. I was sorry when you left.” Remus nodded once more, kissed Sirius tenderly, and left the kitchen looking touched. Sirius nodded his head, asking Theo to follow him, and they both left the room, leaving Hermione alone with Draco. “Sometimes, your group of friends amazes me.” Draco smiled as he took her hand, holding it tightly for a moment to still her as she stood up to gather their dirty cups, “i’m trying, okay Hermione? I'm trying, and I’m not used to all of this,” he gestured vaguely around the kitchen with his hand, “am I doing all right?”  Hermione’s heart melted as she sat down, straddling his lap. “Yes, Draco, you're doing more than all right. I promise.” She smiled, “I loved the way you pitched in to help Ron cook breakfast earlier, and I love how you just accepted Remus for what he is. That can’t have been easy for you.” Draco sighed, “neither thing was that hard. To be honest, I should have done it all years ago.” Hermione leaned down, inhaling the scent of his hair as she nuzzled against him. “Better late than never, though, huh?” she asked, and he nodded  as he reached up to kiss her.
  
  

  
  
When they finally broke apart, they both pitched in to clear up the kitchen, and twenty minutes later, when they were finished, there was still no sign of Theo and Sirius. Slightly suspicious as to what they were up to, Hermione led Draco through the house to look for them. There was no sign of them anywhere, though, and she was starting to get concerned when Draco pushed the back door open to reveal them both sitting on the small patio, each with a half-drunk glass of firewhisky and a lit cigarette in their hands.  Hermione opened her mouth in surprise, but Draco beat her to it, “I thought you’d given up!” he said accusingly.  Theo looked at him guiltily as he exhaled, “Did you?” “That was what you told me,” “That’s not quite what I said,” Theo blinked, as Sirius conjured two more whiskey glasses with an amused smirk. He silently poured Draco a drink then stopped when Hermione held her hand up to decline his offer. “You told me that I  should  give up, and I didn’t disagree. That’s not quite the same as actually doing it, though.” Draco just grunted as he sat down beside them and sipped from his glass. He pulled Hermione onto his knee as she glared at Sirius, “you should give up too, and while we’re on the subject of vices all three of you could probably do with new livers, I don't know how you all drink so much either!” In response, Sirius took a long drag of his cigarette and blew smoke into the air away from her. He held her gaze with a twinkle of mischief in his grey eyes, “wasn’t it three hangover potions that you’ve had in the last three weeks yourself, Kitten? And anyway, drinking is a well known talent of mine. It comes from trying to match Remus drink for drink. Not many people can keep up with a werewolf’s metabolism.” “But that doesn’t make it a good talent to have!” she scowled. The fact that he was right about her own recent drinking habits did nothing to settle her irritation. He merely tipped his glass to her as she huffed “I do love it when you’re all feisty, Kitten. But jokes aside, it’s likely to be a difficult evening, so I’ll tuck your dire warnings away and take heed of them tomorrow if that’s okay.”  “Is that so you can just ignore them tomorrow instead of today?” she glared at him playfully as her grumpiness subsided, and he grinned. “Absolutely right.” “On that note, and before I get myself into any more trouble, we should probably leave you to it. Let’s get back to Hogwarts, shall we?” Theo chuckled at Hermione’s renewed scowl and Sirius’s attempted look of innocence.  “Is there anything you need for tonight?” Draco asked as they all stood up and drained their glasses.  “No. But thank you for the offer.” Sirius said, shaking Theo and Draco’s hands and then turning to hug Hermione, “your support means a lot to both of us. For the record, our floo is always open to all three of you, this evening and future full moons aside, though.” Draco and Theo both nodded their thanks, and they all headed back inside to finally make their way back through the floo to Hogwarts.
  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    A violent storm lashed at Hogwarts castle on Sunday morning. The miserable weather was a sharp contrast to the sunshine that Hermione, Theo, and Draco had enjoyed in London the day before. Today, the wind howled loudly while the rain blew in horizontally, threatening to soak anyone who ventured outside within seconds. Hermione looked up from her breakfast to gaze in horror at Harry and Ron as they both entered the Great Hall wearing quidditch robes. “You can’t seriously be going to train in this?” she asked, looking through the windows with a frown. Harry looked as if he was in two minds about doing so himself. “It’s good practice to fly in these conditions. None of us want to be weather flyers,” he said bracingly as Hermione grimaced. “You’re crazy!” She looked around the tables accepting that he was serious, as were the other members of the eighth year teams. Lavender had just finished braiding Parvati’s hair into a tight French plait and was moving on to do the same for Ginny. Lavender passed Luna the tail comb she was using, and Luna took it, wordlessly gazing out at the rain in concern.  “Morning, beautiful,” Draco greeted Hermione with a swish of green robes and a kiss, laughing as she looked up at him aghast. “What's wrong?” “You! All of you, going flying in this storm! I don’t want any of you to get hurt or to be blown off your brooms!” Draco just laughed again and helped himself to a slice of toast. As Hermione looked up, she was shocked to see the amount of hostile looks being aimed at him by some of the younger Gryffindors at the table. Clearly, divisions in the magical world still ran deep.  Theo hardly helped the matter by pulling her to him for a heart stopping kiss. He released her, made eye contact with as many scowling faces as possible, then turned to kiss Draco in the same showy manner. “Please be careful,” Hermione said, choosing to ignore his act of direct provocation. “Come to watch us if you’re worried,” Theo said while ignoring the clamour of shocked muttering he'd just caused. “It's dry in the stands, and some of the other girls are going. You can cast a warming charm and sit and chat or do whatever girls do in this kind of situation.” He gave her another kiss, much to the annoyance of the now openly disapproving Gryffindors, “you’ll worry less if you can see we’re okay.” Hermione seriously doubted this to be accurate, but nevertheless, she soon found herself wrapped up warmly, sitting under a blanket in the drafty stands with Luna, Lavender, Millie, Daphne, Tracy, and Pansy, watching the multi-colored blur of players swooping through the driving rain. She sat back in her chair, half listening to the chatter around her, half watching the skills practice session. Madam Hooch’s whistle sounded, suddenly cutting through her daydream and startling Luna, who shuffled a little closer so that they could talk more privately. “How are things with you, Hermione?” Luna asked, pulling her blonde hair out of her scarf.  “Good.” She smiled, “you?” Luna nodded with a dreamy smile. “Very good, thank you. I haven't said a lot all through this game so far, but I'm delighted that you asked me to play.” “I thought it was Ginny who pestered you until you gave in, the same as she did to me,” Hermione said with a smile.“Well, yes, it was mostly her, I suppose, but Ginny would have played with or without me, you know what she’s like. You wanted me to do it with you because you were worried about doing it by yourself, and that’s why I agreed to get involved.” “Well…. Yes, that is true.” Hermione frowned, wondering again how Luna seemed to understand such delicate things so naturally. “So you're getting on well with Parvati then?” Hermione asked. Luna’s answering smile was huge. “I am. And not just because of the game. I’d like her even if we weren’t playing for points. I'm hoping that it’s not just about the game for her as well. I’m hoping that she likes me too.” Hermione sighed. Once again, Luna had managed to pick up on her own feelings before she had even known that she had them. “I feel the same about Draco and Theo actually,” she confided. “I don't want this to be a quick fling or something that’s just for the game either. My feelings are too strong for that.” “Girls,” Lavender said, shuffling slightly closer, “i’m sorry, but I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying. Is that really what you both think this is about?” “It’s a concern of mine,” Luna admitted, twirling one of her feather earrings, “but I’m hoping that I’m wrong. Parvati doesn’t seem the kind of girl who would use someone in that way.” Lavender nodded. “She’s not. I think you should speak to her and tell her what's bothering you, but I’ll say this, Parvati's my best friend, and I’ve never seen her as happy as she is right now.” Luna smiled, while Hermione sighed, hoping that the same was true for Draco and Theo.  “It was a big thing for Parvati to pair with you, Luna,” Lavender continued. “She hadn’t admitted her sexuality before, and it took a lot of guts for her to do so. Her parents are rather conservative, she wouldn’t be risking their disapproval if all she wanted to do was play a game.” Lavender reached for Luna’s hand and squeezed it as Luna’s eyes glossed with unshed tears. “Dean and I had this same conversation in the domes too,” Lavender continued, “I’ll tell you both because he said it’s okay for me to tell certain people, and I know that you two would be on his list. He told me he’s gay. We both fully expected to be disqualified from the game when we got back to the common room, but we weren't, and we still aren't. I think that this game is about more than just finding a quick shag with somebody new.” Lavender paused to fiddle with the long flowing skirt she was wearing. “Relationships formed in this game seem to last. That's what Seamus told me anyway. He went to Harry’s Godfather’s a couple of weekends ago, and they all spoke about it there.” “Well yes, I suppose that’s true,” Hermione agreed thoughtfully. “I mean Sirius and Remus paired up in the game, so did James and Lily, after a fashion anyway.” Hermione thought briefly about Alice Longbottom and Severus Snape but quickly dismissed that notion. There had to be some pairings that didn't work out each year.  “I think this game is less about casual sex, and more about forming meaningful relationships.” Lavender paused as she looked fondly out over the pitch, “and those kinds of meaningful friendships are the ones that last forever.”
  
  

  
  
“I feel like a drowned rat,” Theo grumbled as Hermione followed him and Draco into the changing rooms an hour later. “I can’t feel my fingers. My toes froze off several hours ago, and I will violently hex anyone who gets in between me and a scorching hot shower right now. You have all been warned.” Hermione laughed as she stepped pointedly out of his way. “Not you.” He reached for her and pulled her firmly back into his arms, “I’ll not hex you whatever the circumstances.” “You're soaking wet!” Hermione squealed as he took her face in both of his icy hands and kissed her firmly on the mouth. He wiggled his eyebrows as he smirked, “give me a moment to get cleaned up, and I’ll be saying that to you,” he paused then lowered his voice, “when you're naked and trapped underneath me in my bed.” It was unfortunate, really, Hermione supposed, that Pansy just happened to be passing with an equally rain-drenched Harry at that precise moment. Harry clapped his hands over his ears, looking horrified as Pansy gave a delighted squeak. “Alright, Potter?” Theo said with a grin “I will be as soon as I’ve scourigified that image out of my brain,” Harry grumbled, with a grudging smile as he made his way towards the showers with Pansy still following.  Half an hour later, when Draco and Theo were both cleaned up, there was still no sign of Harry or Pansy. “Shagging in the shower,” Draco said, leading the way into the Slytherin boys dorms, “they were right next door to me as well. It was most disconcerting.”   “Really?” Theo fixed him with a grin, “goodness, that sounds very distressing. Here, let me take your mind off it.” He turned Draco around to face him, and Hermione settled onto the bed, sitting back to watch them kiss. What started as soft, easy kisses quickly turned much heavier, and soon they were both thoroughly lost in each other. Theo fisted his hands into Draco’s silky, wet hair, and Draco moved his hands under Theo’s shirt. Both of them fought for dominance, although it wasn’t long before Draco gave in with an affected chuckle. Theo walked him backward until the back of his knees bumped into the bed and Draco lay back, moving into a better position as Theo settled on top of him, nudging his legs apart with his thigh. Draco’s hand reached out for Hermione, and Theo groaned as Draco tugged her over to join them. “You like to watch, beautiful?”  Hermione’s voice sounded strained as she answered vaguely, “mhmm.”  “Good.” Theo pulled Draco’s top up and over his head then waited for him to lay back down before starting to kiss his neck. He reached for Hermione’s hand and guided it onto Draco’s chest, then moved down the bed, taking one of Draco’s nipples into his mouth and motioning for Hermione to do the same with the other.  Draco made a faint noise at the feel of both of them kissing him at the same time. Hermione moved around to get comfortable, and when she felt Theo’s hand close on the back of her neck, she released Draco’s nipple to look up, finding herself instantly lost in Theo’s sensuous kiss. “Are you still sore from Wednesday night?” he asked.  “Not at all,” she said, shaking her head. “Good,” he kissed her again, then returned his attention to Draco, kissing his way lower and trying to undo the button on his jeans with his spare hand. When that didn’t work, he just screwed his eyes shut to concentrate and vanished the rest of Draco’s clothes magically. “That’s quite impressive wandless magic, you know,” Hermione said with a smile. Theo chuckled, “Next time you’re worrying about my missed assignments, just remember that I’m better at the non-academic side of things.” He kissed her again, and she moaned into his mouth. “I use my spare time to study the things I want to be good at after all.” Theo guided her hand onto Draco’s cock, and he hissed in response. Theo closed her fingers around his hard length then started to guide her hand into the right rhythm, making Draco moan loudly. After a few strokes, Theo took his hand away, leaving Hermione to continue on her own. It was surprisingly easy to work out what Draco liked. She let his responses guide her and her arousal grew even further as he reacted to her touch. Theo leaned down to kiss him, then tweaked his nipple, smiling at the shudder he gave in response.  After a moment, Theo started to press a trail of kisses down Draco’s body. By the time he reached his belly button, Draco was writhing on the bed underneath his tongue. Theo gently eased Hermione’s hand away, moved lower still, then ran his tongue all the way up Draco’s erection, making it twitch in reply. Hermione gasped, moving back to watch as Theo took Draco’s cock in his hand and swirled his tongue around the very tip. Draco grabbed at the bedsheets, bunching them in his hands as he rolled his head from side to side, drew his knees up, and clenched his toes on the bed. Theo chuckled darkly as he took Draco further into his mouth, sucking him in and out a few times to tease him then leaning down to slowly take almost everything in. Hermione’s eyes bugged wide as Theo paused, then swallowed the very last inch.  Hermione watched, wondering how it was physically possible to do such a thing. Draco just lifted his hips from the bed and thrust gently into Theo’s mouth with a whimper. Theo held him there for a moment then pulled back to take a deep breath before repeating the move a couple more times. When he pulled off entirely, Draco moaned his protest, but Theo just motioned for Hermione to take over instead. “Not so deep, just take as much as you’re comfortable with,” he said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.  She nodded, letting Theo guide her into position, and she stared down at Draco feeling slightly nervous. “I’m so fucking close right now,” Draco muttered, “are you sure you want to do this?” She nodded again, taking him in her hand and kissing experimentally all around him as Theo had done. She flicked her tongue over Draco's slit, licking at a small white bead of pre-come and finding its taste to be much more pleasant than she had expected. She carefully took the head into her mouth and felt Draco’s whole body tense as she moved her mouth lower. “Fuck, Hermione,” Draco gasped as she sucked a little harder, enjoying the reactions she was getting from both boys. She leaned down, feeling Draco bump against the back of her throat and wondering how Theo had swallowed him the way he had. She moved her head up and down, and Draco gasped. “He’s gonna come,” Theo told her, “pull off now if you don’t want him to do it in your mouth.” Wondering what it would feel like, Hermione did the exact opposite. She leaned down, buried Draco as deeply as she could in her mouth and was rewarded with a low, guttural groan.  “Oh, Gods!” She wasn’t even sure which one of them uttered it, but her eyes bulged wide as Draco came, filling her mouth with warm liquid. “Suck then swallow,” Theo said, sounding hugely affected himself, and she did as he suggested, her eyes watering with the effort of not gagging. When Draco eventually relaxed, she released him gently then looked at them both rather shyly.    Draco just stared at her as he exhaled loudly, while Theo looked ready to devour her. “Have you ever done that before?” Theo asked, and she shook her head, licking her lips and swallowing against the slightly irritating feeling at the back of her throat.  “Jesus, love,” Theo said with a groan, “you’re perfect.” She laughed, looking at Draco as he pushed himself up onto his elbows to stare at them both in wonder. “I think I just died and went to heaven,” he said, and Theo smiled wickedly as Draco moved out of the way on the bed. Theo smiled at Hermione as he took her hand. “What about it then, love, you and me?” Her answering smile was wide as she nodded, “I thought you’d never ask.” “Oh baby, I'll ask you anytime you like. Come here.” She moved towards him, and he leaned down to brush his lips over hers. “Watching you suck Draco off just now was about the hottest thing I've ever seen in my life.” He kissed her again. “What do you want to do with me now?” His eyes were visibly darkening as he watched her. “Everything.” She sank her teeth into her bottom lip, shivering as various possibilities ran through her brain. “I’ve been thinking about being with you ever since you gave me that first massage in my bed. Come get me, Theo.” “Oh, holy hell.” He rolled over, kissing her hard, pulling her closer and demanding her submission the same way she had seen him do to Draco. She yielded to him instantly, and he inhaled slowly through his nose, clearly fighting to stay in control. With another muttered spell, all of their remaining clothes disappeared, and she felt his toned body press deliciously into hers. His fingers played with her nipples, teasing each one until they were both throbbing with tingling pulses of pleasure. She gasped as his fingers slipped lower, splaying out across her stomach then moving lower still until they glided gently through her silken folds. Theo quirked a brow, “I told you you'd be soaking wet for me, didn't I?”  She whimpered as she kissed his neck, sucking experimental love bites into his skin. “Oh Gods, there, right there. Harder.” She bit down, and he bucked against her, pressing into her with a loud moan. His finger slipped inside her, and she mewled, moving into him as he curled it, brushing his knuckle against her sensitive back wall. His thumb flicked over her clit, and she pressed against him again, feeling her climax build. “One more finger,” Theo whispered, gently adding another to the one that was already inside her. “Relax beautiful, tell me if anything hurts.”  She nodded, but it wasn’t uncomfortable in the slightest. She sighed with pleasure at the blissful feeling of fullness and the insistent brushing tease of his thumb still on her clit. As his other hand played with her nipples, she leaned up to kiss his mouth, losing herself to the insistent rhythm he set and coming hard against his fingers.  When she’d calmed again, he brought her hand around to his cock. He was thicker than Draco, but not quite as long. His silky smooth skin felt the same, though, and she stroked her hand up and down, loving the reactions she found she could pull out of him. After a moment, he stilled her hand then rolled over so that he was straddling her. “Are you sure?” he asked as he lowered his hips to stroke himself against her.  He felt like fire against her still sensitive skin. “Yes. Totally sure.” He nodded, “I'll be gentle.”  “I know you will.” She stared into his blue eyes as he lined himself up and slipped carefully inside. His gaze was intense, he paused every few moments to let her adjust to his size. Each time he stilled, he brushed a kiss over her lips, and when he was fully seated inside her, he started to move, kissing her reverently with each tentative thrust. “You can move more than that. I won’t break.” His eyebrows twitched at the challenge, and he picked up the pace a little. “I’m being a gentleman right now.” She laughed, feeling him thrust slightly more firmly in reply, “Then bloody well don’t be.” His eyes fluttered shut on a sigh, and he snapped his hips, pushing much harder and deeper inside of her. She cried out, lifting her legs to wrap them around his waist, until he finally moved at the pace and pressure that she wanted. “Why not?” He opened his eyes as he kissed her again. “Do you think you might like it dirty?” “Yes,” she asserted as her her body arched up underneath him. She gasped as he thrust harder. “I think I might. I want you to try it.” “You want me to make you scream?” “Yes!”  “How loud?” “Theo,” she gasped, remembering his fantasy from last week, and she opened her eyes to find him staring down at her in wonder, “please Theo.” She was dimly aware of Draco casting a silencing spell, and then she abruptly lost all of her senses. Theo thrust his hips forwards as he plunged desperately into her, and she cried out as her orgasm crested, shattering her into a million pieces underneath him. She clenched hard around him, and his breath left his body in a big rush as he came equally hard inside her. Her walls fluttered deliciously as white-hot shocks of pleasure coursed through her whole body. When Theo finally relaxed again, he dipped his forehead down to rest against hers, and she opened her eyes feeling dazed. “Of all the words to choose….” he said with a smile as he lifted his head and stroked her hair back from her cheek, “it had to be ‘please Theo.’” “I remembered what you told me in your fantasy Wednesday evening,” she said as they both tried to catch their breath. “So I see.” He propped himself up, gently removed himself from her, then picked up Draco’s wand and used it to cast a cleaning spell over them both. You're perfect, Hermione. Same goes for you, too, blondie. Come here.” Without a word Draco moved down the bed and they snuggled down together under the duvet.  “Are you okay?” Draco asked, wrapping an arm around her as she traced the lines of Theo’s tattoos thoughtfully with a finger.  “I’m more than okay, thank you,” she said with a smile, “In fact, I’m perfect.” Despite her words, something was bothering her, though. Luna and Lavender’s words from that morning were still circling in her head. “What’s wrong love?” Draco asked gently. Hermione sighed. Trying to hide her insecurities from him seemed pointless, he was much more perceptive than she had initially thought. “It’s just something that Luna mentioned earlier,” she admitted. “ There was silence as she wondered how best to word what she wanted to say. Both Draco and Theo waited patiently until she was ready. “Umm…. well, you see, Luna really likes Parvati, and she thinks that the feeling is mutual,” she paused, focusing on the place where the time tuner on Theo’s arm morphed into a clock. There was a date attached to the clock, she idly wondered what the significance of it was. “And?” Theo prompted, watching her curiously,  “Well, Luna was worried that Parvati was only with her because of the game. We’ve been playing it for two full weeks now, and I guess they’re developing stronger feelings for each other.” Draco nodded, “and you're worried that we only want you for the game as well?” he asked. She nodded, closing her eyes against the sudden, unwelcome threat of tears. “I wouldn’t put it quite like that-” she protested weakly. “Hermione,” Theo’s voice was soft as he cut her off. “The game does what it’s meant to do, and I think it’s a damn good invention. Sirius and I were talking about it when we were in the garden yesterday. The four of them invented it because Sirius wanted to get into Remus’s pants, James was after Lily, and apparently Peter Pettigrew had his eye on someone too. They invented it as a means to an end, as a way to get them together with the partners they fancied. The relationships mostly lasted longer than the game that year, and so the game became redundant. Some years the game is abandoned halfway through because none of the pairs want to play it anymore, some years, they just keep playing it to use its weekly prompts. The game is a catalyst for starting relationships, nothing more.” “I don’t think this is about the game for either of us anymore,” Draco said, tightening his fingers on her arm, “that’s if it ever was. Why do you think that almost everyone got magically paired up with someone they really liked? It’s all in the magic.” Hermione frowned, “so you mean it’s designed to play on people’s desires and to give them a chance together?” “Yep.” Theo smiled, “Why do you think Ginny paired up with Blaise, Hannah with Greg, Luna with Parvati? It’s too perfect to happen like that naturally, so it’s magically designed to be that way.” “Why did Dean not pair with Seamus then?” she asked in confusion. “Because when people sign up, they state their sexual preferences. Mixed sex, same sex, or multi sex. Both Dean and Seamus asked for opposite sex partners. Draco and I ticked every box for a reason.” Hermione was quiet for a moment as she processed this new information. “So you wanted me before we were paired up?” “Since fourth year,” Draco admitted, making her gasp loudly in shock. “Since about sixth year when I noticed you had breasts.” Theo grinned cheekily, lightening the suddenly serious mood. “Neither of us wants you purely for the game Hermione,” He said, pressing a kiss to the tip of her nose. Not at the start and certainly not now. Now, please stop worrying and have a nap before the meeting tonight.” “Okay.” She settled down as her fears abated, and she knew, without understanding how, that they were both telling her the truth.
  
    Chapter Text
    Sunday evening’s game meeting was much shorter than the previous ones had been. Because they were two weeks into the game and already three couples had been disqualified or had left through choice, nobody was voted out by the game’s magic, therefore the only task left was for Theo to announce the theme for the coming week; Skills Exchange. The idea behind this was that each member of a pair would teach their counterpart something new, thereby increasing everyone’s skill base and hopefully bonding each pair closer together. “What are you going to get Draco and Theo to teach you?” Ginny asked Hermione once the meeting had finished. Both girls had retreated to the Gryffindor boys dormitory for some time alone with Harry and Ron. Although the last two weeks had been lovely, Hermione had found that she was missing the tight-knit bond the four of them had formed during the time between the war ending and their return to Hogwarts, and a private catch up was long overdue.   Hermione and Ginny were lying on Ron’s bed, with Ron and Harry sitting opposite on Harry’s. It felt comforting to talk like this, it reminded Hermione strongly of summer evenings at the Burrow when they had all retreated to Ginny’s room to chat, closeted away privately from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the house. Hermione blushed as some rather X-rated thoughts ran through her mind. “Wait a moment,” Harry held up a hand, “I’m still traumatized by what I overheard Theo say to you earlier ‘Mione, Do I want to hear your ideas if the mere thought of them has you blushing like this?” Hermione fixed him with a teasing grin, “well, since I happen to know  exactly  what you and Pansy got up to in the showers directly after you both eavesdropped on  us, I don’t think you’re in any position to hold the moral high ground here, Harry Potter.” Harry had the good grace to flush, while Ron stared at Hermione slightly agog. “What the hell did you do in the showers, mate?” he asked, turning his blue eyes to stare at Harry instead. Ginny’s grin was huge as Hermione giggled. “Draco heard you, did you know?” “Were you and Pansy shagging in the showers?” Ginny laughed at Harry’s mortification, “Damn, why didn’t Blaise and I think of that?! Anyway, Harry, you’ve changed.” She softened her eyes as she regarded him thoughtfully. “You were never like this with me. No, wait a sec,” she waved a hand to hush him gently, “I’m not jealous or being weird here, I promise, I’m just concerned about you. Pansy seems to be bringing out a side of you that we never knew existed, I just want to know that you’re okay with that.” Hermione blinked at Ginny’s directness but didn’t protest her sentiments. She had been wondering the same thing herself. Harry stared back at Ginny for a moment as the heat left his cheeks, then he smiled. “You’re right, Gin. I think it’s similar to what Remus said yesterday. We never had the chance to be young and carefree, did we? I guess that now the responsibility of saving the world has gone, this side of my personality can come out more. And yes, Pansy does dare me to do things that I wouldn’t normally do, but I quite like it.” He paused to grin wickedly, “we knew full well Draco was next to us in the showers, by the way, that’s why we did it. He’s Pansy’s ex, and he’s well, he’s Malfoy, isn’t he? We both wanted to wind him up a bit. What did he say?” “Not a lot in all honesty,” it was Hermione’s turn to flush at her memories now, “Theo didn’t give him a chance before he, well... let’s just say we took Draco’s mind off of it quite well.” Despite his bravado, Harry pulled a disgruntled face as he nodded. “Anyway, Gin, to be fair, you seem to be doing some fairly wild things with Blaise, so the same question goes to you. Are you happy with him?” Ginny’s smile said it all as she nodded happily. “What about you, Ron? Are you happy with Millicent?” “Yes. I am,” he said with an equally satisfied smile. He turned to Hermione without elaborating any further, “so you and they, you’ve? I mean, with both of them?”  Hermione nodded. “Don’t you talk about this during your boys' nights?” she asked, laughing as Ron’s obvious discomfort warred with his curiosity, and he ended up pulling a rather confused face. “To a degree.” Harry said, “but we stray onto sport and other things more often than not, no one goes into too much detail about the finer points of their relationships.”  “Oh, we go into great detail on our side of the room,” Ginny laughed, “very descriptive detail. Don’t we Pans?” She looked up as Pansy opened the door and stared at them all with a frown. “What’s up?” “Every time I see my boyfriend near one of you lot, you're all lolling about in bed together,” she teased, not looking at all angry as she crossed the room to ruffle Harry’s already wild hair. “I know he’s irresistible and all, but still, he’s mine. Can I join you?” Harry laughed as he took her hand and pulled her down to sit beside him. “It’s skills exchange week then Potter, what are you going to teach me?” Harry turned, nuzzling his face into her sleek black hair. “What do you want to learn?” “How to cast one of those shiny silver Patronus things that you're so good at.” She grinned as Harry agreed. “What do you want me to teach you?” Ron raised an eyebrow as Ginny mimed throwing up over the side of the bed, and Hermione laughed. “How to dance properly,” Harry said after a moment’s thought. “You’ve invited me to your parent’s Yule Ball, I don’t want to make a fool of myself in a room full of purebloods who can all dance a proper waltz.” Pansy looked at him happily as Ginny and Hermione exchanged looks of disbelief with Ron. “You're on, handsome,” Pansy said, leaning forwards to seal the deal with a kiss.  “What’s Blaise good at?” Ginny asked, clearly attempting to bring the conversation back onto more familiar ground. It seemed that she, Hermione, and Ron were all struggling to process the fact that Harry Potter had just willingly asked for classical dance lessons from Pansy Parkinson. “Apart from the obvious, I mean,” Ginny added, still looking disconcerted by Harry’s request.  “Art,” Pansy said after a moment more of staring soppily at Harry. “Ask him to teach you how to draw. You won’t draw anything of note, but you’ll be a quivering mess in moments. It’s the way he describes things and the way he sits behind you and guides your arm.” She cleared her throat as Harry pulled a face, “just,” Pansy shivered, grinning back at Harry, “yeah. Just ask him.” Ginny nodded. “Gotcha. What about you, Hermione? Ron?” “Karate.” Pansy said, giggling at Ron’s confusion, “Millie. She’s a black belt, which is apparently pretty good. It’s a muggle self-defense sport,” Pansy clarified as Ron still looked confused. “As for you, Granger, oh Gods! The possibilities there!” Hermione blushed. “I was going to ask Draco to teach me how to fly,” she said, trying to ignore Harry’s stunned look of outrage. “I’ve been offering to teach you to fly for years!” he complained, as Pansy put a consoling hand on his knee.  “I know you have. I’m really sorry, Harry. It’s nothing against you. It’s just that after flying to the domes and not feeling like my life was in peril, that I was about to fall off of a dragon or be chased by murderous Death Eaters, flying actually turned out to be quite enjoyable. I didn't know I liked it.” “Get Theo to take you into the forest and show you the unicorns then,” Pansy said. “He knows how to find them safely, and they are so beautiful.” “What can I teach Millie?” Ron wondered aloud, making Pansy stare up at him appraisingly as she stretched out, laying down on her stomach between them both. “How a man should treat a woman,” She said thoughtfully and then looked down at the bed covers. “Alright, Weasley, I know you and I have a past, but I have to admit you're a decent bloke. Millie, well, she’s never had a father figure in her life, and her mother was a bit unstable too, so she practically brought herself up. You can show her what family is. What it means to have someone that she can rely on.” Pansy stared at Ron until he dropped his eyes, and she sighed. “And I think that’s enough sappiness from me, so before I make an even bigger fool of myself I'll admit that I might have been wrong about you in the past-” “I'm sorry too, actually, Pansy,” Ron said, cutting her off. “I’m sorry for the nasty things I've said about you-” he broke off as a knock sounded at the door, “come in?” The door opened to reveal Hannah, standing there with tears streaming down her cheeks and a rather murderous looking Greg holding her hand. “Hannah!” Hermione, Ginny, and Pansy all jumped up as Hannah stumbled forwards into Ginny’s arms. “What’s wrong?” “Have you been in your dorm tonight, Granger?” Greg asked as Hannah tried and failed to speak. The bottom dropped out of Hermione’s stomach as she saw the folded up piece of parchment clutched tightly in Hannah's hand.  Slowly she shook her head. “No. We came straight in here for a chat after the meeting.”  Greg nodded. “Someone needs to find Draco and Theo then. I’m not being held responsible if they find out about this from someone else and Draco hurls himself off the Astronomy Tower or Theo murders someone.” Greg prised the crumpled parchment out of Hannah’s hand and passed it to Harry. “These aren’t pretty, and if you’ve got one along the same lines, Hermione, then yours will be worse than this.” Hermione frowned in confusion as Harry opened the folded parchment note. She gasped, It appeared to be a direct copy of the transcription of Greg’s Death Eater trial, a list of the crimes that he had been found guilty of, and the terms the Wizengamot had laid out for his probation. There was also a photograph showing him holding hands with Hannah outside what looked like the herbology greenhouses. The words “Death Eater’s Whore” were once again splashed across the moving picture in untidy red writing.  “To make matters worse, I found this on my bed hangings, and these on Draco and Theo’s,” Greg said, holding out three more pieces of parchment. They showed both Hermione and Hannah’s family trees, with the muggle side of Hannah’s family highlighted and Hermione’s whole family underlined in red. The caption on Hannah’s read “Muggles and Half-Bloods,” and Hermione’s simply said “Muggles.” “As if any of us bloody well care about this sort of thing now?!” Greg said crossly.  “Where  are  Draco and Theo?” Hermione asked as dread pooled low in her belly. She remembered the hatred that had been aimed at both of the boys at breakfast when they had stopped by the Gryffindor table, and her heart constricted with anger that there was still this amount of discrimination in Hogwarts. “I was hoping they were in here with you,” Greg said, as Hannah wiped her eyes, pulling herself together with a sniff.  “We haven’t seen them since the meeting,” Hermione admitted, her stomach still churning in horror. “Right. Let’s check your bed for notes, Hermione, then let’s find them.” Pansy said, and they all hurried from the room.  Hermione sighed deeply as she approached her bed. As predicted, pinned to the hangings were two sets of trial notes and two lists of criminal convictions, complete with their corresponding sentences. There was also a picture of Hermione, Draco, and Theo holding hands in what looked to be Hogsmede, and the now familiar words “Death Eater’s Whore” scrawled underneath the carefree image. Hermione sighed, torn between wanting to incinerate the parchment without even looking at it and reading it thoroughly to learn the specifics of the boy’s criminal records.  “‘Mione,” Ginny put a hand on her arm, and Hermione realized she was shaking. She bit back furious tears as Ron took the parchments from her and raised his eyebrows. “Don’t read it,” Ginny advised Hermione gently, although she was surreptitiously glancing over Ron’s arm at the written notes herself. “We need to find them,” Pansy said. “I can imagine what’s on there and-” she rubbed her forehead with her hand, “Harry, we need to find them now.”  “Let’s go then. Wait here, girls.” Ginny tugged the parchment out of Ron’s hand as he turned to follow Harry and Pansy out of the dorms.  “Let’s wait in our dorms instead,” Greg said. “I can guarantee it’s not any of us behind these notes. There’s only four of us in there, three of us have been targeted, and I'd stake my life on these not coming from Blaise.” Hermione nodded, blindly following as he led her, Hannah, and Ginny into the Slytherin boy’s dorms.  They sat down on Greg’s bed, and Hermione unfolded her parchment note with a sigh. “What do your notes say?” Hannah asked, and Hermione passed Theo’s transcripts to Ginny then looked at Draco’s one herself.  After a moment, Hermione closed her eyes letting out a long sigh as she wiped away another tear. “It gives the date of his trial, the verdict, which was guilty of all charges, his sentence which was mostly suspended due to his age and mitigating circumstances, namely being in fear of his life and certain crimes being committed under duress. Then there’s the actual list of crimes, and,” she covered her mouth with her hand as she gasped, “Oh Gods!” she gave a choked sob, “It’s huge!”“Don’t read anymore, ‘Mione,” Ginny advised, squeezing Hermione’s shoulder sympathetically as she continued to read Theo’s transcripts. “I think it’s impossible not to,” Hannah said quietly. “I had to read Greg’s.” Hermione nodded, feeling thoroughly sick as she glared at the long list of unforgivables that Draco had been found guilty of performing. She groaned as the dormitory door opened, and Blaise stepped inside. “At least there are no actual murders on here, I suppose,” she said, trying in vain to make light of the horrendous situation. “Two attempted ones, though, both missed aims apparently, and that doesn’t even count Dumbledore.”    “I saw Harry, Pansy, and Ron in the common room,” Blaise said by way of explanation as he kissed Ginny hello. “I thought you spoke at Draco’s trial, Hermione?” His face was unreadable as he took the note from Greg’s hand to read, “I thought you knew what he was accused of?” “I spoke about the time we were captured and taken to Malfoy Manor, and I vouched for him not identifying me to Bellatrix and Lucius when he could easily have done so. Also, I spoke about how he was fighting for our side during the Battle of Hogwarts. I’ve never seen an actual list of his crimes before,” Hermione admitted.  Blaise nodded. “May I?” Hermione handed him the parchment, and the room fell silent as he read without a flicker of emotion. “Okay. Do you want my thoughts on this?” “Yes, please,” Hermione said in a small voice.  Blaise took a deep breath. “Imperious curse, Madam Rosmerta. Cursing Katie Bell. Poisoning Slughorn’s mead. Letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Attempted murder of Albus Dumbledore. You know all about these crimes already. His and Narcissa’s lives were in danger, this whole string of crimes was a desperate attempt at self preservation and the protection of his Mother. He was sixteen years old.” Blaise paused, looking up as everyone nodded. “Then we have accusations of the use of the Imperious curse five more times, all with a guilty verdict. You have to ask yourself why he did that. Draco’s not one for controlling other people, Hermione. Personally, I’d say it was pure desperation again. Crucio, multiple counts, I don’t know the specifics of these exact spells either, but I’m telling you now, Draco hates hurting other people, and Crucio would not be his spell of choice either. Greg, can you shed any light on these?” Hermione turned as Greg nodded. “Yes. When we were in D.E. meetings, the Dark Lord liked to see how we were doing with our training. He’d get us to Crucio each other to see how magically strong we were and how vicious we were willing to be. If we didn't comply, he’d use the same spell on us himself or get someone like Bellatrix or Dolohov to do it, and believe me, that was to be avoided at all costs. Myself, Draco, and Theo all learned pretty quickly that taking each other’s Crucio's was a hell of a lot better than the alternative. A lot of these were aimed at Theo and me, look, mine’s the same.” Greg took his own list of crimes back from Blaise and held it out for Hermione to read. It was very similar to Draco’s, minus the sixth year crimes, and Hermione nodded, still feeling distinctly sick. She took Theo’s transcript from Ginny and read his similar detailed accusations. “Why wasn’t Theo marked?” she asked, not understanding why their crimes were so similar, yet Theo had never received the Dark Mark.  “He was going to be,” Blaise said, “but his father hid him then lied to the Dark Lord to protect him. He said that Theo had dragon pox and was near to death. If he recovered,” Blaise made air quotes with his fingers, “he was due to be marked straight away.”  “Theo had exactly the same training that we did,” Greg agreed, “but the one decent thing his father did was get him out of the marking ceremony.” Hermione’s eyes finished scanning down the three lists of crimes, then she glanced back up at Greg. “Did any of you,” her eyes flickered to Blaise and back to Greg again, “I’m sorry to ask this, but I need to know, did any of you kill anyone? Ever?” Greg held her eyes as he shook his head. “No. Not unless it was a side effect of a different curse used during the Battle of Hogwarts. None of us have ever used the Killing Curse effectively if that’s what you mean to ask.” Hermione nodded, then took a deep breath before reaching out to take Hannah’s hand.  “Then these don’t matter. Do they?” She swallowed hard and bit her trembling lip. “Nothing’s changed. You’re still the same people you were before someone pinned a vindictive bit of parchment to our curtains, aren’t you? You’ve all stood trial, you've all either served time, or are still serving probation for these crimes,” she wiggled the parchment in the air, “therefore debts to society have been, or still are being paid-” She looked up with a jolt as the dormitory door banged open, and Theo stood silhouetted against the brighter light that flooded in from the common room. He stared at Hermione nervously, as if unsure of his reception, and she gazed back at him, seeing fear written all over his usually confident face. “What does it say?” he asked in an unusually hesitant voice. “It doesn’t matter what it says,” Hermione said fiercely as Pansy shoved them all further forwards into the room and closed the door behind them. “It doesn't matter what any of them say. There’s nothing listed here that I didn't already suspect, and if anything, confronting it all like this just gets everything out in the open sooner. There are no secrets or unspoken truths between us anymore, I know the gritty details now, and in some ways, I'm glad that I do.” “Same,” Hannah said bracingly, “if whoever did this was hoping to split us up, then they’ve failed. They’ve actually just brought us closer together. “Look at your face Theo,” Hermione said gently as she stood up and walked towards him, “you're terrified. Do you think I'm going to reject you now that I’ve seen a list of your crimes?” “Well, it wouldn't be an unreasonable thing if you did now, would it? There’ll be some really nasty crimes listed there. A lot of unforgivable curses, I’m guessing, too.”  Hermione nodded. “There are, yes. But I think I've seen enough of you both over the last few weeks to know who you really are. So if you're not about to be put off by my less than pure wizarding genetics, I think I can cope with both of your rap sheets.” Theo visibly sagged in relief as Hermione stepped closer. He closed the gap between them to wrap his arms around her and bury kisses into her hair. “Can I see your family tree?” Blaise held the parchment out to him, and Theo took it with a brave attempt at a smirk. “All I see on here is people, Hermione. People who’ve produced the girl with the biggest heart I’ve ever known. Do me a favor please?” she nodded as he pulled back to smile down at her, “Go hug Draco, he’s fairing worse than me right now, he’s a nervous wreck.” Hermione sniffed as she nodded and looked up to see Draco holding onto Pansy as if she was a lifeline. He froze as Hermione smiled gently at him. “Come here?” she invited, and he moved closer to her, still looking wary. “I spoke at your trial. You can’t possibly think this would put me off?” He raised his eyebrows until they almost disappeared into his hair. “We all know you spoke about certain events at my trial. Not the details of the crimes. There’s attempted murder on there Hermione, three counts.” “Two. They didn’t count Dumbledore. Why did your aim miss on the other two killing curses you tried to cast?”  Draco sighed, closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose looking distraught. “Because I couldn’t do it.  He  was holding his wand to my Mother’s heart both times, so I had to try. I uttered the curse, but the thing with an Avada is it takes true intention to cast. You need to want to see the other person die cold heartedly. I flicked my wand away at the last possible moment, not that anything came out of it anyway because I just don’t have that intention inside of me. The spells that hit those particular prisoners came from other people, and the Dark Lord missed our little deception. Someone else shot the lethal curses for me, to protect me because he knew I couldn’t do it.” Draco strode away from her and paced the room by the window as Hermione covered her mouth with her hand in horror. “Who?” she asked, her voice trembling with shock, “who did that for you?” Draco spun around with a bitter laugh. “Does it matter?” “I suppose not-” she faltered, and Theo stepped up to Draco, stilling him then turning him around to face Hermione. “I think…. In this situation, it actually does matter,” he said. Draco nodded grimly. “Fine. It was Theo’s Father. But it may as well have been me. I’m just as guilty.”  If the Wizengamot had thought you guilty, they would have put you in prison,” Hermione said, her heart breaking for both of them. “They did find me guilty. I was in Azkaban for nine months, Greg served six and Theo four.” “And when the time was up, they let you out, right?” she asked, and he nodded. “How long did your fathers get?” “Three years,” Draco said. “Five,” Theo added. “Three,” Greg said. Hermione sighed as her brain spun wildly. “You couldn’t help how you were born, any more than I can help my parents being muggles. It’s the same thing as Harry being branded the Chosen One. He didn’t choose that himself either. Other people have decided all of our fates for us, and I think I’ve had enough of their interfering. Now quit hiding in the corridor Draco, I’m not changing my mind about wanting to be with you. Or you, Theo. Whoever wrote these notes has gone too far this time. This goes beyond glares at the breakfast table. They’ve pissed me off, and I’m going to find out who’s behind it all and bring them to justice. Who's with me?” “Me!” Pansy said. Ginny agreed, Harry nodded, as did Ron, Blaise, Theo, Greg, and finally, everyone in the room turned to stare at Draco. “Alright!” he finally conceded with an incredulous laugh, “Merlin Granger, you're something when you're all riled up, you know.” He finally relaxed as Hermione hugged him fiercely. “And I’m pretty glad you're on my side in all of this and not against me this time.” “That’s better,” she said, nodding in satisfaction. “I’ve always found that I work best as part of a trio actually, don’t you agree, Ron? Harry?” “I’d totally agree. I’d also say that I’m bloody proud of you right now ‘Mione,” Ron said, while Harry nodded his agreement. “I couldn’t have said that better myself,” Harry turned to face Theo and Draco, “good luck with her, you two. It looks like we're all in for a hell of a bumpy ride until this note writer is caught.” 
  
  
  
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione, Hannah, and Ginny all decided to sleep in the Slytherin boys' dorms that night. For Ginny, this was nothing new. In fact, she claimed not to remember the last night she had spent in Gryffindor Tower, preferring to sleep with Blaise in the eighth years dorms instead.  Hermione, Draco, and Theo chose Draco’s bed for themselves as it was hidden away in the corner of the room and therefore was the most private. After only one minor interruption from Lavender and Parvarti, who had heard about the latest notes and wanted to check that Hermione was okay, they all settled down in their pajamas with a cup of chamomile tea unwind after the emotional evening.  Ginny and Blaise, being the least affected by the notes, soon retreated behind their bed hangings, reinforcing them with a solidly cast silencing spell as they bid everyone goodnight. Theo rolled his eyes then added a muffliato charm, and Hermione laughed as Greg added yet another silencing spell for good measure. Hannah and Greg retired next, and Hermione glanced at Draco as he failed to stifle a yawn. “Come on,” she put a gentle hand on his knee, “show me your bathroom, then let’s all go to bed.”  Theo fell asleep first, and once he was snoring softly, Draco turned to face Hermione. “He’s more upset about these notes than he’s letting on you know,” he said sadly, “I’ve never known him just settle down and go to sleep like this, especially since you're here. You know what he’s like for pushing his luck.”  Hermione nodded. “It’s lovely the way you both care so much for each other. Theo was more worried about you than himself earlier, and now you're worried about him. I meant what I said though, these notes, Draco are not putting me off. Whoever is sending them is only pushing us closer together.” Draco hummed in agreement as he stroked a hand down her arm. “I agree. For the record, I don’t give a hang if you're the first witch born into your family in a thousand generations of muggles. I know I was wrong about all that blood superiority shit. You understand that, don’t you?” Hermione nodded. “Yes, I do. Can I ask you a rather personal question, please?” Draco nodded as he held her in the dim moonlight, and she paused, thinking of the most delicate way to word what she wanted to ask. “Why did Theo’s Dad help you with the unforgivable curse you couldn’t cast? Were you very close to him?” Draco looked at her sadly. “Don’t sugar coat things, Hermione. Do you really mean to ask why it was Theo’s Dad who killed those prisoners for me, rather than my own?”  “Well...” Draco closed his eyes as his fingers stroked little circles on her arm. “You can ask me anything you want to know, please don’t look so worried about it all. My father was in the dungeons at the time, he was kept out of the room by the Dark Lord so that he wouldn’t know what had happened until a lot later. It was the ultimate cruelty if you like. My father knew that one of two things would happen, either I would become a murderer, or I wouldn't be able to cast the spell, in which case my mother would surely die by the Dark Lord’s wand. Obviously, neither of those were things he wanted to see happen. Thoronus stepped in to help me, as he would have done for Theo, I like to think my father would have done the same had things been the other way around. The Dark Lord had no idea that our families were that close." Draco paused with a sigh. "I found out months later that it wasn’t me that flicked my wand away either. Someone else pulled it for me. A few older Death Eaters were protecting myself, Theo, and Greg, and they all landed longer stints in Azkaban for it. It hardly seems fair.” Hermione frowned. “That doesn’t sound fair at all. Can I ask who moved your wand?” “I’ll give you one guess.” Draco opened his eyes as Hermione watched him. “Severus Snape?” He nodded. “Your Godfather?” “Yes.”  “Oh, Draco.” Hermione snuggled into him as a tear slid from her eye and ran down onto the pillow. “You really went through a lot together, didn’t you? You, Theo, and Greg?”  He nodded. “Yeah, we did. Vince Crabbe too, but unfortunately, he bought into it all. So did Greg up to a point. More so than Theo or I did at least, but Greg also came around very quickly when we got away.” Draco paused, staring at a point on the other side of the room as if caught up in memories. “You’re right. We went through a lot. Which is why I hate this note writer bringing it all back now.” “Why don't you try looking at things another way?” Hermione asked, trying her best to brighten his melancholy mood, “we’re all closer now than we would have been if we hadn’t talked about all of this, and we wouldn’t have talked about it if not for the notes.” “I'll probably be able to think like that tomorrow,” Draco agreed, “it's all a bit raw for me to be philosophical about right now.” “Let’s go to sleep then,” Hermione said as she felt Theo nestle closely in against her other side, holding on to her as if he was scared she was going to leave while he slept. “Tomorrow is another day.”
  
  

  
  
And indeed it was. The day in question was bright, sunny, and freezing cold, perfect conditions for learning to fly. Once school lessons had finished for the day, Hermione stood on the quidditch pitch with Ron’s broom held nervously in her hand. Draco, Theo, Ginny, and Blaise were beside her, stamping their feet and muttering mutinously about the cold.  Hermione eyed the innocent looking broomstick suspiciously as Draco mounted his broom beside her. Harry had offered her the use of his Firebolt, but she had declined. She didn't think that having her first proper flying lesson on a world class racing broom was a good idea. Ron’s Nimbus, while still, an excellent model, was going to be far more forgiving of any mistakes she might make.  She was grateful when Blaise, Ginny, and Theo kicked off into the air and soared straight up into the heavens to practice their own maneuvers. Hermione settled herself carefully over the handle of Ron’s broom, and Draco showed her how to hover a couple of feet off the ground while he kept pace beside her.  Flying proved to be considerably less scary than Hermione had thought it would be. Draco talked her through the basics, and she managed to move, stop, hover, and turn successfully. She wobbled as he taught her how to gain height, and she found landing to be a positively terrifying experience, but when she was in the air, she thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of freedom that flying gave her. As she landed for the final time, Draco smiled proudly. She turned to grin at him, flushed with her success. She handed Ron his Nimbus back then thanked him with a kiss to the cheek as Draco lifted a brow and patted the handle of his own broom in silent invitation.  “Okay, but if you go upside down, I swear I’ll never fly with you again.” She eyed the mischief that was written all over his face with slight trepidation as she settled herself comfortably in front of him and nestled comfortably back into his arms.  “No upside down flying. Gotcha.” Draco said in a way that didn’t fill her with confidence. She yelped as he kicked off into the sky, accelerating upwards with the speed of a rocket. Pansy waved from the front of Harry’s broom, and Hermione grinned in return as Draco sped through the rapidly darkening sky with Theo on their tail.  Flying on Draco’s broom was just as exhilarating as it had been the time they had flown back from the domes. In the air with him, she felt free and as if they had left her worries on the ground the moment they took off. She especially loved not being in control of the broom. Handing that over left her free to fully enjoy the experience without worrying about anything else. Draco laughed when she told him as such, they spiraled lazily back down from a great height, and he wrapped his arm more securely around her. “Is it just flying that makes you feel that way?” he asked, as his lips tickled her ear making her shiver. “What do you mean?” she asked as Ginny swooped past them, racing Blaise and winning by more than a full broom length, even against his sleek Italian racing broom.  “Well, for a lot of people flying is a very sensual thing. I was wondering if your preference for surrendering control tips over into other sensual areas?”  “Are you talking about sex?”  He gave a low chuckle as she turned to face him. “Yes.”  “I don’t know,” she admitted. “Although, Theo’s dirty talk made me want to find out.” Draco moved her hair out of the way and kissed her neck as he gained height, soaring upwards again until they were dizzyingly high. Ron and Millicent were flying more sedately a long way beneath them, and Milli shrieked nearly as loudly as Hermione did when Draco suddenly dropped out of the sky to pull up neatly beside them.  “We don’t normally see you up in the sky Millie?” he said conversationally as if he hadn’t just frightened the living daylights out of her.  She smiled in reply. “Apparently, if you're with the right person, the sky is a nice place to be.”      “Is that right?” Draco asked as he swooped away with Hermione to race an incoming post owl. The surprised creature just hooted crossly at him, and he laughed. “Oi, Nott, is it too late to find the unicorn now?” “Yes.” Theo pulled a face, “I know I like a little adventure, but walking into the Forbidden Forest at night is akin to a death sentence, mate. Dawn is the time to do it, just after the sun rises and the monsters go to bed.” “Okay. It looks like it’s your turn to teach us how to cast a Patronus then Hermione. Neither of us have ever managed to cast anything with that spell before, though, so teaching the pair of us might be a tough ask.” “Of course it won’t be,” Hermione asserted, feeling as if she could cast the strongest Patronus in the world right now, the exhilaration of flying was so powerful. “Let’s go grab dinner before we miss it. Then we’ll have a go.” “Then can we explore the handing over of control during sex?” Draco asked hopefully, laughing as Theo chose that moment to swoop back beside them. “Just a mo,” Theo chirped, flying by their side, “who’s wanting to explore handing over control during sex?” Hermione blushed and giggled as Draco kissed the back of her neck again. “Hermione prefers flying when one of us is in control. I asked if she feels the same about sex. She’s curious to find out.” “Oh, is she?” Theo said, giving her a very affected look indeed, “you just let me know when you want to figure that one out, sweetheart.” He nosed his broom close enough to kiss her, and Draco pulled the handles close enough that she could carefully swing a leg over Theo’s broom. They both helped her into position, and when they were sure she was safe, Draco dropped away and twirled into a series of death defying corkscrews, leaving her wrapped up securely in Theo’s arms in the middle of the rapidly darkening sky. 
  
  

  
  
After the latest round of notes, a number of eighth years were making a point of sitting together at meals, making up several mixed house groups at the usually house specific tables. Tonight at dinner, Hermione settled herself between Draco and Theo, opposite Harry and Pansy at the Slytherin table, Luna and Millie joined Parvati, Dean, Lavender, Ron, and the other Gryffindors, while Greg slid in next to Hannah with the Hufflepuffs.  Despite Hermione’s concern, their efforts caused a complete lack of reaction at the Slytherin table. Everyone just settled down to eat as though nothing untoward was happening at all. In fact, the ones giving Hermione, Draco, and Theo the most attention were Daphne, her younger sister Astoria and Theo’s ex-girlfriend, Tracy Davis.  “What’s up, Daph?” Theo asked, spotting them staring. Astoria looked a little upset, and although Hermione didn’t know her, she always hated to see people in tears. “Nothing,” Daphne replied, looking slightly troubled, “It’s just… well, don’t you think you're asking for trouble all sitting here together like this? I mean, it's lovely to have you, Hermione, Harry, don’t get me wrong, but if the note writer is trying to split you up, aren't you just provoking them by being so open?” “That’s exactly what we’re trying to do,” Pansy said, waving her fork in the air fiercely. “Let whoever wrote those evil notes take this as a slap in the face.” Daphne smiled, although she still looked concerned. “Let’s hope they recognize that then. I’m glad you're not put off by the notes anyway.” Hermione nodded, watching Astoria in concern as the younger girl wiped her eyes again. “They threw us a little bit, I’ll be honest, but we decided that we’re stronger than a few grotty bits of parchment. Are you okay?”  Astoria gulped, looking away before bursting into proper tears again. Daphne pulled her little sister into a hug then looked sadly back at Hermione. “It’s just boy trouble. We’ll look after her, don't worry. And good for you, maybe the note writer will realize they're on the wrong track now. If they’re trying to split you up, that is. I see the Ravenclaw table isn’t looking too happy about the seating situation over here tonight.” Hermione turned to see Marietta Edgecombe, Cho Chang, and another of their friends frowning at the mixed up tables in distaste.  “Want me to hex anyone for you, Tori?” Theo asked conversationally while flashing a grin at the disapproving Ravenclaws.`“Yes, please!” Astoria said a little defensively as she glared in her sister’s direction. “But Daphne won’t let me ask you to!” Daphne rolled her eyes as she hushed Astoria, and Theo chuckled. “Well, just give me the word, and I’ll be happy to oblige. I know a few good hexes if need be,” he said with a wink as he cheerfully dug into his treacle tart. Astoria smiled at his reassurance, finally pulling herself together as Daphne whispered soothingly into her ear.
  
  
  “Thank you for cheering Tori up,” Daphne said as they let themselves into the eighth year common room half an hour later. “She likes you, Theo, that meant a lot to her.” “Who upset her in the first place?” Draco asked with a frown. “She’s practically family to us, as are you Daph, I don’t like seeing either of you upset. What happened?” “Let’s just call it a case of unrequited love, shall we?” Daphne said with a dramatic sigh. “Plan A didn’t work, so she needs to move on to plan B now.” “Oh,” Draco frowned sympathetically. “I didn’t know girls needed so many plans for a little dating.” “Yes. It’s always good to have a backup plan. After all, it’s painful when the person you like doesn't want you in return.” Tracy said mildly while looking pointedly at Theo. Theo hesitated, and Hermione tried to let go of his hand. She still felt somewhat guilty about the way he had unceremoniously dumped Tracy, even though logically she knew it wasn’t her fault. Theo looked sheepishly at Tracy as he gripped Hermione’s hand to stop her from pulling it away. “Yeah, uh, look, I’m sorry about that, Trace, it was rather, umm… insensitive of me. I’m sorry for the way I treated you.” Tracy smiled at him as her blue eyes softened. “It’s all right. Thank you for the apology though, that means a lot. Anyway, I’m with Justin now, and he’s better suited to me than you are, so actually, you did me a favor.” Theo grinned, clearly relieved to have been forgiven so easily. “Every cloud has a silver lining, I suppose,” he said, and Tracy just laughed as she and Daphne let themselves into the girl’s bedrooms. The door closed behind them, then Theo turned to stare at Draco in horror. “Wow! That was awkward!” Draco just laughed. “Well, you can't say it wasn’t thoroughly deserved, can you? You were an absolute git to her, Theo. It's about time she finally called you out on it!” Theo looked contrite as they dropped their broomsticks off and left the common room again. By the time the door opened to the Room of Requirement, though, he was beginning to cheer up again. Pansy, Millie, Harry, and Ron had arrived before them and were already practicing. Draco blinked as Harry’s fully corporeal stag walked towards Hermione then lowered its head to greet her. She patted the insubstantial creature as best anyone could pat a wisp of smokey vapor, and they all watched as the stag pranced happily back to Harry. Ron’s Jack Russel Terrier broke off from leaping around another, semi-transparent Patronus animal, raced over to greet them with its tail wagging madly then turned around to rejoin what Hermione now recognized to be a badger. “How long have you been in here?” Hermione asked, watching Pansy cast wisps of silver smoke into the air. “Ten minutes or so,” Ron said. Hermione grinned as she watched the playful badger chase the equally happy terrier around the room. “I learned to do this in class, though,” Millie grinned rather proudly, “so it’s not new for me. Snape taught us how to do it.” “It’s a beautiful badger, Millie.” Theo pulled his wand out and sat down on one of the overstuffed bean-bags to watch the three Patronuses stalk around the room together. “I’ve never even cast a glimmer, in class or anywhere else.” “Nor me,” Draco confirmed. “Although you should have been alright, Theo, it’s the Dark Marks that fucked Greg and me up for this charm, or so I thought. Can Blaise cast one?” “Yes,” Pansy confirmed. “His is a panther.” “That figures,” Draco nodded. “Right, come on then, Hermione, what do we need to do?”  “Well, first, we need to take bets,” Theo said, smiling as everyone looked at him curiously, “on what yours is going to be Malfoy. My money’s on a peacock with the amount of time you spend preening in front of a mirror-” “You're an arse, Theo.” Draco grinned at him good naturedly, “at least some of us attempt to do our hair in the mornings and don’t just go for the disheveled bedhead look.” “Watch your step, Malfoy!” Pansy laughed, narrowing her eyes, “I happen to like messy black hair. My money’s on it being a dragon anyway. Draco, Dragon, and all that.” “Let’s give it a go and find out, shall we?” Hermione asked, watching as Pansy laughed again and a substantially larger amount of vapor shot out of the end of her wand.  Hermione taught Draco and Theo the necessary wand movement, the incantation, and the best way to summon the happy memories needed to cast the charm, then sat back to watch their first few attempts. Neither of them produced anything on the first few tries, and she could see Theo, in particular, starting to glare crossly at his wand. She opened her mouth to speak, but a sudden flash of brilliant silver on the other side of the room caught her attention instead. They looked up to see a large silver bird shoot out of the end of Pansy’s wand and fly around the room.  “Well fuck!” Pansy shouted in surprise, making Harry laugh. The slightly insubstantial bird flew in a large circle before coming in to land on long graceful legs. “What is it?” Pansy asked, peering at it more closely. “I think, wait, It’s a flamingo Pans!” Harry exclaimed, standing up to hug her in delight. The flamingo turned its head then promptly fizzled back into wispy, formless mist again.  “Wow!” Pansy grinned, flicking her wand to make the flamingo reappear. “That's incredible! I love it!!” As she bounced up and down in happiness, the flamingo shimmered, growing stronger until it was fully corporeal. It took off again, soaring around the room, showing itself off to anyone who wanted to see. “See Potter, I knew I wasn’t all bad and full of dark magic inside. Trying to sell you to the Dark Lord was an act of self preservation, not inherent evilness after all. What a relief!”  “Uh…. yeah, isn’t it?” Harry just pulled a face, laughing as Ron spluttered incredulously. Harry conjured his stag into the room again, and the flamingo landed on it’s back. The stag threw up its head in apparent approval while everyone in the room looked on in surprise. “What’s your stag called again?” Pansy asked. “Prongs,” Harry said softly as Pansy smiled.  “Well, Prongs, meet Beaky. Beaky, Prongs. You better learn to play nicely together now, no mucking around.” Hermione giggled as both the stag and the flamingo bowed their heads to Pansy, looking for all the world as if they were listening hard. Harry laughed. “Come on then, Malfoy, let's see your try.” Draco flicked his wand, but three times in a row, nothing happened, and he looked rather disheartened. “That's rubbish,” Pansy asserted. “What memory are you using?” “That's private!” Theo protested as his own wand flashed feebly through the air.  Pansy grinned. “I used the memory of the first time Harry and I…. you know…. it did the trick for me. Just saying.” “Okay….” Draco looked at her speculatively, appearing to gather himself ready to try again. Still nothing happened. “Oh shit…. What?!” he asked, looking apprehensively at Theo, who had a wide and rather mischievous grin on his face. “Expecto Patronum!” Theo shouted. A giant wisp of silver mist filled the air, then quickly faded to nothing as Draco’s eyebrows shot up. Theo punched the air in triumph. “Come on, blondie, get up. We’ve got this,” he said excitedly, and Hermione grinned. Not wanting to be beaten, Draco stood up too, and with everyone watching anxiously, Theo cast his spell again. This time the see through silver wisp solidified slightly into a vague animal form, but it faded away before they could tell what it was.  “Come on, Draco!” Pansy said, grinning enthusiastically as she tugged on his sleeve, “Come on! You and Hermione, think of your first time in those domes. Theo’s there too, whispering filthy thoughts in your ear. Ridiculously wanton things, things that make your toes curl. She wants you. You want her, Theo’s driving you both nuts, now cast the spell!” Draco did, and he blinked in surprise as a stream of ghostly silver smoke issued from his wand tip.  Hermione stumbled as Pansy yanked her across to stand in front of Draco. “Look at her!” Pansy encouraged, bouncing up and down on her toes, “you’ve wanted her for years. Imagine it’s the Yule Ball. She’s on your arm instead of me. Granger, go ahead, kiss him!” Hermione just stared into Draco’s molten silver eyes, as he gazed wordlessly back. Theo, Harry, Ron, and Millicent were all staring at them as the vapor continued to issue from Draco’s wand. He bowed his head slightly, placed one hand on Hermione’s cheek, then pressed his lips to hers. “Push this power into your wand,” Hermione whispered as she kissed him back. She could feel Draco drawing energy from her, and her magic flowed freely into him. Instinctively she reached out for Theo with her other hand, and when he reached her, she pulled him into their huddle too. Theo put his arm on Draco so that all three of them were touching, then there was a flash of brilliant silver as something huge erupted from his wand. Hermione gasped as an enormous silver thestral soared into the air and flew around the room much as the flamingo had done earlier. “Bloody hell, Malfoy!” Ron said, gazing at it in awe. Draco blinked, looking shocked by what he had done.  Theo laughed. “It’s perfect, Malfoy. Only you could have a thestral, the creature that best bridges the dark and light, seriously mate. You amaze me at times!” “Come on, Theo,” Draco said softly, turning to capture his lips with a kiss, “show us yours properly now.”  “Expecto Patronum,” Theo said rather forcefully, and Hermione staggered as she felt another pull on her magic and the silver cloud reappeared at the end of Theo’s wand. “Come on, Nott.” Draco’s eyes bored into Theo’s, and everyone in the room held their breath as the thestral continued to soar around, lighting up the room. “You’ve never gone down without a fight in your life. Don’t lose out to me now!” The brilliant light from the thestral reflected in Theo’s blue eyes as he narrowed them determinedly.  A flicker of pure affection crossed Draco’s face as he leaned closer to Theo and spoke so that only he and Hermione could hear. “Think of your Mother,” Draco whispered. “Go on, I know it’s painful, but we’ve got you.” Theo’s eyes slid to Hermione’s, and the shapeless cloud slowly solidified. Several gasps sounded from the other side of the room, but Hermione was unable to tear her gaze away from Theo’s to look. The image of a young woman formed strongly in her mind. A woman with tumbling chocolate curls and honey brown eyes. She was taller than Hermione, a little broader and curvier, but there was a striking similarity between Hermione herself and the woman in the image. Draco put a hand on both Hermione and Theo’s faces and gently turned them both to look to where the thestral stood. It was bowing down as a large lioness gently licked its skeletal head.  The room was utterly silent for a full minute. “‘Mione?” Harry said finally, without taking his eyes off of the Patronuses, “cast yours.”  “Expecto Patronun,'' she whispered, and the familiar otter burst from her wand tip as if it had been waiting for her to release it. It gamboled over to the two enormous silver creatures and bounced around their legs, looking as if it was delighted to be reunited with old friends.  The scene was spellbinding. The lioness pressed her head into the otter and the thestral. The thestral stood tall, occasionally flicking its sparse tail. The otter bounced and frolicked playfully between all eight silvery legs.  Theo dropped his spell first, the lioness faded, and he looked at Hermione as if in shock. Draco also looked stunned as his thestral faded and Hermione's otter disappeared as well, plunging the room into comparative darkness. “I’m going out for a cigarette,” Theo announced rather shakily, and he stalked away without another word. Draco turned and silently followed him, leaving Hermione staring at the others in confusion.  “Follow them!” Millie said, waving her hand frantically to encourage Hermione away, “you can’t let them just walk away after that!” “What….. What was…. that?” Harry asked, sounding amazed as Hermione didn’t move. “That was a fucking miracle!” Pansy said, wiping away a tear, “that’s what that was. No wonder he’s emotional. Theo’s mother was a Gryffindor,” Pansy explained. “She died when he was a child and she looked a lot like Hermione. Theo had no idea what form his Patronus would take. I’ve seen him try and fail to cast that charm a million times, by the way. So, the first time he succeeds in casting it is when he’s drawing from Hermione’s magical power, and his Patronus just happens to be a lioness.”  Millie nodded in agreement. “He’s a Death Eater’s son who avoided taking the Dark Mark by the skin of his teeth. He thought his magical core was too dark to produce a Patronus, and then that pops out. Now, bloody well go after them, Hermione, they’ll be behind the herbology greenhouse. Go!” Hermione nodded, turned and left the room of requirement at a run.  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione’s hopes of finding the unicorn in the Forbidden Forest with Theo and Draco had to be put on hold for a few days due to bad weather. Tuesday morning dawned dismal, grey, and cold, and it stayed that way for most of the week. The mountains surrounding Hogwarts disappeared, blocked from view by the clouds that hung low in the sky, while the mist that obscured the forest never entirely cleared, making it unsafe to venture inside. Finally, there was a break in the constant drizzle late on Thursday afternoon. Hermione was humming happily to herself as she changed out of her school uniform in the Gryffindor girl’s dorms when a flash of brilliant silver suddenly brightened the room.  She laughed, looking up with an affectionate eye roll as Theo’s lioness Patronus stalked regally towards her. Now that he could cast one, Theo was letting no chance to use it pass him by. It reminded Hermione of the time Fred and George had passed their Apparition tests and had chosen to apparate every time they moved at the Burrow, and Molly had spent all summer telling them off. “Grab a jumper witch. We’re going unicorn spotting.” It was funny to hear the graceful, rather feminine Patronus speak with Theo’s deep, very male voice. She grinned and cast her own otter into the room, then bent low to speak to it. The reply she received was fast. She had just zipped up her jeans and was regathering her always wild hair when Draco’s noble silver thestral stalked through the door without breaking its stride. “Apparently I’m to tell you that Arithmancy essays can wait. today’s lesson is Care of Magical Creatures.” Hermione laughed as the thestral faded away, then Ron’s Jack Russel bounded into the room in its place to chase her up. “Alright! I’m coming!” She giggled as she pulled on her jacket and stepped out into the common room. She frowned as a sudden, unreasonable pang of jealousy assaulted her at the sight of Theo talking to Daphne and Tracy while he waited for her. She averted her eyes from his knee, which was almost brushing against Daphne’s, and focused instead on the way his eyes lit up when he saw her.  “Hello, beautiful.” His passionate kiss left her in no doubt of where his loyalties lay, and she pushed her irrational feelings aside.   “Hi.” “Ready then?” Draco shouldered his firebolt as she looked around. Ron and Millie seemed to be coming with them, as were Luna and Parvarti.  Hermione nodded, following the others out of the castle into the cool but sunny afternoon. “I think the unicorns will be on the far side of Birch Copse. What do you think, Luna?” Theo asked. “I agree, it’s a good place to start,” Luna confirmed, swinging her leg over Parvarti’s broom. “If we don’t find them there, we can check Faery Holt and Darkwood like we usually do.” “Perfect. Come on then, you.” Theo patted Hermione’s arm, making her startle. She hadn’t realized that Theo and Luna had been into the forest together before, but now that she thought about it, it made perfect sense that they had. They both liked magical creatures and the same school subjects, or so it seemed.  “What's going on under all that hair?” Theo asked, settling himself comfortably onto the broom behind her. “I can hear you thinking from here.”  “Nothing.” She nuzzled her neck into his lips as he kissed her, broom kisses were fast becoming a favorite of hers. “I just didn't know you and Luna were friends, and I feel like I should have known that. The last few weeks have been such a whirlwind, sometimes I feel like I know more about you than I actually do.” Theo nodded as he kicked off gently. “Luna and I have been friends for years, not overly obvious ones, I suppose, but we both love being out here in the forest and looking for the creatures it holds. Who do you think persuaded her to play this mad Cupid game in the first place?  And  to sign up for a female partner?” She raised her eyebrows in surprise. “That was you?”  He nodded. “Yep. She was nervous about revealing her sexuality. I told her I'd curse anyone who gave her a hard time, then she just went for it. I don’t know Parvati, but she seems nice, and they look happy together.” Hermione smiled as she turned to return his kiss. “Well, thank you for looking out for her. I appreciate that, and I love that you did that for her in the first place. Parvati’s nice. I think they work well together.” “I think Parvarti might be struggling a bit at the moment,” Theo chuckled, and Hermione gasped at the now familiar sight of Luna hanging precariously off the side of Parvati’s broom, scanning the trees below. “Under there, Draco, can you swoop in through the trees without getting-” Theo broke off as Draco dipped low under the tree canopy and back out again, “-apparently you can. Bloody showoff!” “Nothing there,” Draco grinned as he pulled up into a cartwheel. “Here!” Luna called, pointing to a different copse, and Draco again dipped out of sight. He came up again, shaking his head then removing a few stray twigs from his hair as Theo laughed.  “What’s this over here?” Ron asked from behind them, and Hermione turned her head in the direction of Milli’s answering squeal. “Oi, mate, They’re over here.” Theo banked round to see where Ron was pointing. He slowed to a hover as he pressed his cheek against Hermione’s. “That’s the spot.”  The unicorns were already alert. Their ears were pricked, and their heads were held high as Theo smoothly dropped the broom handle. Draco landed steadily beside them and they all froze as one of the unicorns tossed its pure white head while snorting delicately. The herd moved off slightly as everyone else landed, and Luna held her hand up to signal everyone to stop moving.  Hermione did, and she also sank to the ground as Luna bid. The unicorns gradually relaxed again, slowly returning to the patch of grass they had been grazing on before they were interrupted. Hermione held her breath as she watched the powerful creatures, hardly able to believe what she was seeing. “Have you ever seen these close up before?” Luna whispered. Parvarti shook her head. “Only that one Professor Grubbly Plank brought to class once, and that was a tame one,” she admitted. “Hagrid can’t get near these easily,” Luna confessed. “That's why he doesn't use them in class much. I like Hagrid very much, but he’s large, he’s very indelicate, and he just doesn’t understand the subtleties that the unicorns like.” “He also doesn't appreciate them because they don’t breathe fire or explode in your face when they move,” Ron grumbled, making Millie chuckle.  Hermione said nothing but secretly thought that Ron had a good point. When the unicorn herd was settled again, Luna slowly stood up, and carefully edged closer to them. She kept her eyes downcast, being careful not to look any of them in the eye.  As soon as the closest unicorn looked at her, Luna paused then backed up a step. “Watch this,” Theo whispered to the others, “it takes a minute or two, but just wait till you see what she can do.” Luna had the closest unicorn’s undivided attention. Luna turned herself, angling her shoulders away from it, then waited. “That’s the lead mare of the herd,” Theo whispered.  The unicorn stretched out her graceful neck, and when she pulled away with a snort, Luna took another slow step towards her. It was as if they were engaged in a dance. Luna would step forwards and wait, the unicorn would pause, then make its move, and Luna would step back in reply.  As Hermione watched, the unicorn was, little by little, drawing closer to Luna. Finally, they were standing mere feet apart, looking as if they were being slowly drawn together by a delicate thread. Hermione held her breath as the unicorn stretched out her head, and as Luna turned away, the magical creature bumped her on the shoulder with her nose. Luna stilled then very slowly turned around. She kept her eyes downcast as she smoothly held out her hand. The unicorn snorted and pulled back, but Luna didn’t move. Gradually the unicorn moved back into place, finally lowering her head to accept Luna’s caress. The unicorn enjoyed Luna’s attention for several minutes until Luna reached behind her, gesturing to Parvati to step forward. Parvati stood up, and, under Luna’s instruction, she also managed to stroke the completely wild unicorn. When she turned away, letting Milli take her place, tears were rolling freely down Parvati’s face.  “You need to pet her Hermione,” Parvati said, still looking awestruck. “She’s so beautiful.” Hermione doubted that she would be able to do what Parvati had done. She had never been particularly good with wild creatures. Still, Draco nudged her forward as Millie stepped back and slowly, incredibly, as Luna taught her how, Hermione found herself stroking a unicorn. The unicorn’s white hair was softer than silk. Hermione's fingers tingled as she stroked the creature's bowed head, and she was filled with the most wonderful sense of tranquility. She could have stood there for days simply enjoying the calm aura the unicorn projected.  All too soon, though, Luna gestured to Ron to take her place, and Hermione stepped back to watch. Theo nudged Draco forwards once Ron had taken his turn, and Draco slowly did as Luna instructed. When he stretched out his right hand, though, Luna smoothly pushed it down, then picked up his left one instread.  She couldn’t hear what they were saying, but she watched as Luna pushed up Draco’s sleeve. She held her hands on either side of his Dark Mark while continuing to hold his arm in hers, offering it out to the unicorn. Hermione watched in amazement as the unicorn dropped her head to blow her breath all over Draco’s arm. She could see Draco looking alarmed, he clearly wanted to pull away, but Luna held him firm.  “What in the name of?” Hermione jumped as Theo reached for her hand and gripped it tightly, “Why the hell didn't I think of doing that?” “What's she doing?” Hermione asked. “Healing it,” Theo breathed. “Something as pure as a unicorn can negate some of the hatred the mark was branded with. I should have thought of this years ago!” When the unicorn finally pulled her muzzle away, Draco stepped back, looking shell shocked. He sank down to the ground, gazing wordlessly at Hermione as Theo stood up with a wink. Luna turned away, leaving Theo to step up to the unicorn alone, and the pair greeted each other like old friends. When the unicorn was finished with being sociable, she just turned and loped gracefully away, flicking her tail as she disappeared with the rest of the herd into the impenetrable barrier of trees. 
  
  
  “Well, I’ll be damned,” Draco said as he emerged from the bathroom later that evening, “look at this!” Hermione broke the kiss she was sharing with Theo and looked up from the bed as Draco brandished his left forearm at them both.  Theo simply lifted an eyebrow in question, but Hermione’s cheeks heated as she stared shamelessly. Since Draco was still damp from the shower and was clad only in a low slung towel, his left forearm was not the thing that was attracting her attention the most. “Look at what?” Theo asked, attempting an innocent tone as he exchanged an amused glance with Hermione.  “This,” Draco held out his forearm again. Theo frowned at it in confusion, “mate, you’re normally trying to hide that away, now you're openly wafting it in front of us! What are we meant to be looking at anyway?!” “Quit being a smartass, Theo. Look at it properly. In fact, don’t just look at it. Press it. Go on. I dare you.” Theo grinned lazily up at him. “Really, Draco?” he drawled, “you think daring me to do something is a good idea?” Draco just shrugged, tossed Theo his wand, and continued to hold out his arm. “I’ve done it.” Theo rolled over on the bed, now staring at Draco in obvious confusion. Slowly, he picked up his wand then touched it to the faded Dark Mark. “Morsmordre,” he whispered. Hermione startled at the spell he used, but Draco just grinned. “There’s no reaction in it now. No reaction to that spell at all. Not even a tingle. This bloody thing has randomly tingled, burnt, itched, niggled, and generally been a pain in the arse for nearly five years. After that unicorn healed it earlier, there's nothing. Not even when you cast Morsmordre over it.” Theo grinned. “That’s amazing. I’m really pleased for you. Now, will you please drop that towel? because I’m much more interested in what’s underneath it.” Draco released the breath he had been holding in a laugh as Theo quirked a brow. “It might even take Hermione’s mind off of the Arithmancy essay that she  still hasn’t finished yet.” “I should go and finish it now!” Hermione muttered, ignoring Theo’s teasing and his scandalized look. “Off you go then, sweetheart. Draco and I will just play together, you know, on our own, without you.” That’s not fair,” she grumbled, having absolutely no intention of moving.  “You can copy my essay. I’ve already done it. We’ll just make a few changes, I don’t care,” Draco said, inching his towel lower and smiling at the reaction the move pulled from her. “I’m not copying your work Draco Malfoy!” she exclaimed furiously as her brain caught up with what he had just said. “I’m perfectly capable of finishing the essay tomorrow. I just don’t usually leave things to the last minute like this, that’s all.” “Relax, beautiful,” Theo whispered as he kissed her again, “there’s plenty of time to get it finished tomorrow.” “Assuming we don’t distract you again,” Draco tousled his wet hair with his fingers, staring at her through his slightly too long fringe, grinning as she shivered in response. “You two are a terrible influence,” Draco smirked as he leaned down to kiss her himself. “Yep,” Theo agreed cheerfully as Draco released her, and he turned her face to claim her lips for himself again, “but we can see you love it. Lay down, baby, let me show you exactly…. how…. bad…. an influence I can be.” Hermione smiled as she settled down. “Do you know what a safeword is, beautiful?” Draco asked from the side of the bed. She nodded. She did now anyway, following another rather enlightening chat with Ginny. “Good. So tonight, if you’re up for it, we’re going to play a little game. For now, we’ll start with color words, and I’ll check in with you plenty of times to make sure you’re okay with what we’re doing,” he reached down, starting to unbutton her blouse as he spoke slowly. “Assuming you’re open to that idea, of course.” Her breath caught in her throat, and she clenched her thighs against a powerful wave of arousal. “ Are you open to the idea, sweetheart?” Theo asked as he stroked her flushed cheek with the back of his fingers, “we don’t mind in the slightest if you’re not.” Breathlessly she nodded, already struggling to form sensible words. “I’m very open to that idea. In fact, the mere mention of it turned on so much I could barely speak for a moment,” she admitted with a deep blush.  “Good girl.” Draco paused with his fingers on a button, staring at her reverently. “So, green means you're happy with what we’re doing. Yellow tells us to be careful and to slow things down, and if you say red, then we stop everything immediately. How does that sound?” He undid the last of her buttons, and his pupils dilated further as he opened her blouse, revealing a dark green, lacy bra. “Nice underwear.” She nodded on an unsteady breath as Draco glanced over to Theo. “How about you then, handsome? Can you cope with me being in charge tonight?” “Oh fuck yes!” Theo whispered as Draco raised an eyebrow in amusement. “For a while anyway.” “Only for a while?” Draco eyed him with outright passion as he leaned down to kiss him. “What are you so scared of that you can’t give me the whole night?” “You wouldn’t last the whole night. You’d be begging me to get on top after a while, and you know it,” Theo chuckled, reaching out to grab Draco by his towel and tug him closer. “See? Look at that,” Theo said as the towel fell to the floor, “your rock hard and twitching at even the thought of me bossing you around. You're the right height for me to do this, too.” He leaned forwards, ran one hand over Draco’s weeping cock, and sucked him straight into his mouth. Hermione whimpered as Theo’s head bobbed a handful of times, making Draco growl as he sank his fingers into Theo’s messy hair. “You’re terrible at being told what to do,” Draco said through gritted teeth. Theo just nodded, his mouth too full to do anything else. He pulled up and off of Draco, leaving him panting with desire, then grinned sideways at Hermione, “ I Bet you’re not though, are you darling.” “No,” she admitted as her arousal escalated to uncomfortable levels. “I think I might be quite good at that.  Draco smiled as he opened the drawer beside his bed and pulled out several items. Among them, she recognized the silk tie and the blindfold that Draco had picked out from the table of goodies in the Cupid game a couple of Sundays ago. “Do you now?” Hermione watched him gently finger the silk tie as he fixed her with an appraising look. Theo slid her blouse over her shoulders. She lifted off the bed to let him move it down and off her arms. “How do you feel about being tied up, beautiful?” A rush of heat to her core caused her answer to come out as a breathy sign. Draco nodded in satisfaction, picked up one of her wrists, and kissed the inside of it gently. He flicked his tongue against her pulse point, holding her eyes as she shivered in response. He clicked his fingers, making the tie replicate itself then threw the new piece of black silk to Theo and started to wrap the remaining one securely around her wrist.  She closed her eyes, losing herself to the moment as Theo replicated Draco’s attentions on her other wrist. “Oh Gods!” she muttered as he nipped at her skin gently, “that feels so good.” Hermione’s eyes snapped open as Theo bound her second wrist and passed it to Draco. Draco moved both of her hands up over her head, then laced them together securely. She shivered as she felt a charm pass over the bindings and another over her belly. She recognised the second one as the now familiar contraception spell, but was confused by the first. “This spell makes the bindings release magically the moment someone utters the safeword.” Draco explained. She nodded as she gazed up into his eyes, trusting him completely. She dragged her gaze across to look at Theo and jolted at the intensity showing in his own blue eyes. “You look so beautiful tied up like that,” he whispered, “you’re like a picture straight out of my personal book of fantasies. Color?” “Green.”  Draco ran his fingers over the lace of her bra, and she shuddered, clenching her fingers on the bedsheets in response to his touch. “Good girl.” He trailed his hands down her body and unzipped her jeans, then slid them down and off her legs, leaving her in just her matching underwear set. Theo scratched his fingernails lightly over her belly, watching her as she shivered yet again in response. “What are you going to do with her now, Draco?” he asked, and Hermione felt her eyes snap back to Dracos.  Draco’s slow smile lit up his handsome face as he raised a testing eyebrow. “So, so many things,” he promised, before leaning down to kiss her. “How do you feel about blindfolds love?” he asked. She paused, considering. “I don’t know. Try me. If I don’t like it, I’ll tell you.” Draco’s smile intensified as he slipped the blindfold snugly over her face. It magically molded until it fit her perfectly, and she was startled to find herself completely blind. Even the light in the room was blocked out. “Color?” Draco asked, and she paused before answering to give herself time to adjust to the loss of her primary sense. It felt… she hunted around for the right adjective to describe her feelings. It was a little disconcerting, but mostly it was exciting. She wanted to experience this, and she trusted both of the boys to take care of her. “Green,” she said.  “Good girl.” Theo’s voice was so low she could barely hear it. She jumped as she felt Draco kiss her navel. He drew little circles around her belly button with his tongue, then blew a stream of cool air over the sensitized skin.  With her vision obscured, her other senses felt heightened, and she jumped again as she felt what she presumed were Theo’s fingers touch her sides, move down to just above her panties, and then back up again. She tugged experimentally against the bindings on her wrists, but they held firm. She was trapped, helpless under both Draco and Theo’s ministrations, and a heady thrill shot through her as Draco leaned in to kiss her. She smiled against his gentle lips and bent her knees to push up into him. She wanted more. Her body was already wound tightly just from the predicament she found herself in, and she wanted to find release. She moaned into Draco’s mouth as he finally lowered himself down on top of her, kissing her hungrily. She writhed in response, pulling again on the wrist restraints. “Color?” Draco asked as he paused, evidently in concern. “Still green, I’ll tell you if it changes, you can stop asking,” she said breathlessly as Theo gave a pained chuckle. That seemed to be all the encouragement Draco needed as well. With her sight blocked, all she could do was feel as he reached underneath her. She lifted up off the bed to let him unhook her bra, then felt it slide up over her head and pool around the silk tie that still bound her wrists together.  Draco’s hands roved across her naked breasts, stroking, squeezing, and coaxing increasingly wanton whimpers from her. He moved down her body and tongued, then sucked sharply at her nipple before soothing the sting with a soft lick of his tongue.  She felt him kiss his way lower down her body then pause to slide her panties off, leaving her naked save for the blindfold and the black silk wrist restraints. Draco disappeared briefly, presumably to dispose of her panties, then he returned, playing once more with her nipples and chuckling as she writhed desperately under his skilled touch.  She lifted her hips, inviting him to touch her where she wanted him most. Her core was aching with need. She was slick and ready, clenching almost painfully on nothing. “Are you alright still?” he asked, and she nodded breathlessly, willing him to touch her again.  “If you want something Hermione,” Theo’s voice sounded from the corner of the vast bed, “You can always ask for it.” She gasped as Draco’s hand brushed across her thigh. High but not nearly high enough. She could ask for it. She knew that, but she’d never done that before. “touch me, Draco? Please?” she whispered, and she felt his fingers touch her stomach infuriatingly. “Lower,” she sighed as he inched his hand fractionally lower.  “Specifics, Hermione,” Theo said, sounding amused.   Draco’s fingers brushed across her skin again, and she squirmed. “You know what I want.” “I have an idea,” Draco whispered. “Do you want me to suggest something, and then you can tell me if I'm right? Or not.” She did want that. Oh God, did she want that. “Yes, please.” Theo’s answering laugh was pure sin as Draco dipped his head, parted her thighs and swiped his tongue directly through her folds. “How dirty would you like me to be?” he asked as he pulled away. Her answer came out in a moan, “Very.” “You’re soaking down here, love,” he murmered, making her cry out as he licked her once more. “What’s made you so wet, Hermione?” “You. You touching me, kissing me. Me not being able to move or see you, the thought of Theo watching us, I like this a lot.” She gasped as Draco lazily kissed her nipple.  “You like not knowing what I'm going to do?” she could feel him moving to the side of her on the bed as if to demonstrate that she had no idea what he was up to. She nodded. The bed dipped beside her again, and she gasped as she heard what had to be him and Theo kissing.  Draco moved back into place over her. “Do you like not knowing which one of us is kissing you?” she flexed her hips, lifting off the bed to arch towards him again, then jumped as a hand smacked her thigh sharply. “Keep still.” Theo’s voice was commanding, and she gasped as she felt his lips start to kiss her abdomen, then slowly creep lower. “I thought you were Draco,” she admitted as Theo slipped lower still. “Oh no, baby girl, you’ve got me now. Draco’s beside you.” “Shall I tell Theo how I want him to make you come?”  “Oh, my Gods yes!” she said, yelping as Theo’s tongue slipped closer to where she wanted it. The mounting need for release was becoming almost unbearable. She tugged her wrists again and couldn't help but lift her hips as Theo’s tongue  finally  dipped to where she wanted it,  “How does she taste?” Draco asked, and she felt Theo’s mouth pause, “Sweet. So fucking sweet. She’s like nectar. And she’s dripping for you, Draco. Or for me, maybe for both of us, I can't tell.” “Both… it’s for both of … you!” Hermione panted. “Use your fingers as well,” Draco said, his voice sounding slightly pained as Theo dipped his head back down.  It felt like heaven as Theo inched his fingers inside her. He moved gently the first time, waiting for her to relax as he stretched her. “So fucking tight, so beautiful and innocent,” he whispered, kissing her again as he slid his fingers back out.  The second time was different. He thrust his digits in much more sharply, but she was so turned on that they slid inside easily anyway. He curled his middle finger against her back wall with firm pressure, making her thrash on the bed as sparks burst behind her eyelids. “Is she allowed to come, Draco?” he asked as he pressed a fraction harder. Hermione didn't think she could stop herself if he said no. She had no idea how to even try, she was so close, and Theo’s skillful fingers were edging her closer and closer to the point of no return, “No.” Draco said, making her gasp. Theo pressed down sharply, and she half leapt off the bed in shock. “And if she comes without permission, you get to spank her arse.” She felt Theo twitch his fingers involuntarily inside her, and his voice spoke close to her ear, “safeword color, Hermione?” “Wha?” she was almost incoherent with need. For a moment, she couldn’t register why he was talking about colors. His fingers had stilled inside her, and she thrashed her hips vigorously, so close to the edge it was almost painful.  Theo pulled his fingers out slightly then slid them sharply back in. “Color, Hermione. We’re pushing you here, and I need to know if you’re okay with it, baby girl.”  Theo’s words finally made it through to her addled brain, and she nodded, “Green!” she gasped.  Theo pressed his fingers against her G spot once more. “Just a tiny bit more then, beautiful. I know you can hold back.” Hermione screwed her eyes shut, concentrating everything she had on holding her body in check, and she finally sighed with relief as Theo removed his fingers. She missed them instantly, though. Her insides were still clenching desperately, her arousal was near painful, and she needed something inside of her. She had never felt anything close to the intensity of this before.  “Good girl,” Draco said deliberately, and she pulled once more against her bindings.  As she calmed a fraction, she felt Theo’s body settle in above her. He leaned down to kiss her softly. She wrapped her legs around his hips, pulling him close, silently begging him to enter her. “I think you deserve a little reward,” Draco said, “I’m going to tell Theo he can fuck you now, Hermione. Is that what you want?”  “Yes!” her voice was a strangled cry once more as Theo moved into position.  “Do you want it gentle and slow, or hard and fast?” Draco asked, and he laughed at her answer. “Hard and fast it is then.” Hermione felt Theo line himself up and nudge the tip of his cock against her slick entrance. “Now,” Draco breathed, and she squealed as Theo pressed smoothly inside.  It took less than a minute for her to come. “Keep going. She can do that again.” Draco demanded, and Theo groaned as he snapped his hips and buried himself deeply inside of her. Hermione barely had time to come down from her first orgasm before Theo was pushing her higher again, faster than she’d thought possible.  Theo set a powerful pace. She lifted her hips to give him better access as he thrust into her and he groaned in response. “Come for us Hermione,” Draco said, “come again, let Theo feel that sweet, tight little cunt clenching around his cock again. Come. Now.” Theo squeezed her nipple between his finger and thumb, and she detonated once more. She felt the impossibly deep thrusts that told her Theo had fallen over the abyss with her, and she lifted her hips to meet him until he finally sank down on top of her.  She felt both the blindfold and the wrist bindings vanish, and she blinked her dazed eyes, looking sideways to see Draco staring at her in wonder. “You. Are. Spectacular,” he said as Theo picked himself up, kissed her softly, and rolled to the side of her.  “Tell me, though,” Theo stroked her damp hair gently back from her face then pulled her into his embrace, “I nearly tipped you over the edge when Draco told you not to come. That last squeeze of my fingers was further than I meant to push you. Were you okay with that?” She knew her eyes were still glazed as she stared up at him and nodded. “Would you really have spanked me if I had come?” Theo grinned, “If you’d wanted me to. Would you have wanted me to?” “I think I would. I think I’d like to know what that would feel like.”  “Didn’t I tell you she’s perfect?” Draco asked, laying down on the bed beside them both. “You did. And, while we’re on the subject of hidden talents, where the fuck did all of that come from with you? I never knew you could take charge like that, it was such a turn on!” Draco just smiled. “It turns out that with the right people beside me, I can do it quite easily. Anyway, I could ask you the same thing.” You’ve never let me go that far before either.” Theo chuckled. “Well, it won’t be the last time I do, that's for sure.” He patted Hermione’s thigh, “how about that then love, was any of it too much?” Hermione just shook her head weakly. “Nope. I’m hoping that was just the start of things.” Theo just groaned, then his eyes lit up, as he grinned. “Oh baby, there’s a whole world of things we can try if you liked this. If you only knew. Hop up and sit on Draco’s cock will you then, love? He’s looking a bit neglected over there, and we can’t have that now, can we?” 
  
    Chapter Text
    
  It was another cold, stormy day at Hogwarts. Flurries of tiny snowflakes were starting to fall, mixing with the constant drizzle and blowing sideways in the gusty wind. Hermione shivered, stomping her feet as she watched the icy droplets settle on her coat sleeves then melt away to nothing as she stood waiting for Theo’s Herbology class to finish. 
 
  It was the last class period of the week, and since the eighth year’s timetables were all different, she and Draco had both had a free study period. They had chosen to spend their time closeted away in the relative warmth of the library, catching up on their massive pile of almost overdue homework. 
 
  Hermione had deflected Draco’s half-hearted attempts to distract her into other, more pleasurable activities, insisting that they both use the free period to get some work done. Draco had reluctantly agreed, and although working next to him had proved rather distracting, she had at least managed to finish two of her five outstanding essays, a feat that they both admitted would never have happened if Theo had been with them. 
 
  Hermione had never been this disorganized with schoolwork. It wasn’t a situation she was comfortable with. As she pressed the final full stop to a fiendishly tricky Potions report, she vowed not to let her personal life interfere with her studies any longer. As tempting as both the boys were, she wasn’t going to compromise her N.E.W.T. grades for anybody.
 
  Ten minutes after the bell sounded, Professor Sprout finally dismissed the students studying for her Herbology elective. She opened the steamed up greenhouse door, peered out at the snow in surprise, shivered, then stepped back to let a group of Ravenclaws out. Hermione recognized some of the girls in the group as the ones who usually sent her, Draco, and Theo disapproving looks, but this time, apart from Marrietta Edgecombe, they barely glanced in her direction. 
 
  Clearly, she wasn’t the one the girls had a problem with.
 
  She bit back a giggle, imagining what Theo would say about their attitudes, then turned her attention back to the greenhouse. Finally, Theo emerged, deep in conversation with Greg and with Daphne trying to pick stray leaves out of his hair. Hermione forced herself not to falter. For some reason, she seemed to be developing a rather irrational problem with his and Daphne’s friendship. 
 
  “Ouch Daph, pull the leaves, not my hair, love! Hey, beautiful,” Theo’s eyes lit up when he saw Hermione. He pulled her into a kiss, and she forced her unreasonable jealousy to one side, smiling at Daphne and Greg then grimacing at the sight of their soil covered hands. “Why are you waiting for me in the freezing cold? I was convinced you and Draco would be tucked up all warm and snug in bed while I was slaving away down here.”
 
  Despite her frustrations with Theo’s lack of study related diligence, Hermione laughed. “No. We were studying in the library,” she said, giggling at his unimpressed face. “Besides, Lavender wants me to ask you something.”
 
  “Does she?” Hermione nodded as Theo shivered, then pulled his jacket tighter around himself as a gust of squally wind blew sideways across the pumpkin patch, “What does she want to know?”
 
  “If she and Dean are going to be dropped out of the game tonight,” Hermione admitted, pulling her windswept hair out of her eyes.
 
  Theo stared at her in surprise. “Well, yes, they will be. They’re bottom of the leaderboard, and someone has to go, so yeah, it will be them.” He narrowed his eyes, leading her the wrong way out of the greenhouse, turning along the path that led towards the lake rather than back to the castle. “Why is she worried about it, though?”
 
  Hermione rolled her eyes. “I’m not gossiping. I’m not, because I don’t do gossipping-” she broke off as Theo snorted with laughter, “-I don’t!” She added indignantly, although the argument sounded weak even to her ears. “She wants to know because she has a plan, but apparently, this plan will only work if they are about to be disqualified.”
 
  Theo grinned as he pushed his messy hair out of his eyes. Hermione reached up to pull a couple more entangled leaves out of his curls. “Ouch! What is it with you all pulling my hair today? And what, pray tell, is this master plan of Lavender’s?”
 
  “Your hair is full of leaves,” Hermione laughed. “Sticky ones at that, they're all tangled up. What on earth were you doing in herbol... wait a minute, is this Devil’s Snare? Where 
  
    are
  
   we going, by the way?” she frowned as Theo ignored her string of questions and continued to lead her further towards the lake. 
 
  “Yes, we were taking Devil’s Snare cuttings. Neville accidentally knocked me into the bush. I’ll get it out in a sec with a bright light, don’t worry. Anyway, what were you saying about Lavender?” 
 
  Hermione nodded. “She’s going to tell Dean that she doesn’t want to be disqualified and that they should leave the game on their own terms like Harry and Pansy did rather than being booted out.”
 
  “Okay,” Theo nodded, “the best way to do that is for her to kiss someone else.”
 
  “That is exactly her plan.” Hermione grinned as they approached the lake, “but not for herself. She wants to get Dean to kiss someone else. A particular someone else, and the person she has in mind is also quite up for the idea.”
 
  Theo stopped walking. He stared at her with the ghost of a smirk playing on his lips. “Finnigan?” Hermione nodded, smiling as he laughed properly. “Has Lavender ever heard of the term ‘playing with fire?”
 
  “I did nearly ask her the same thing,” Hermione admitted as they reached the far wooded shore of the lake. “But since we’re technically still playing a blind dating game, it seemed rather a pointless thing to say. 
 
  Theo sat down on a fallen tree and gestured for her to sit beside him. “Seriously, what are we doing sitting down here? It’s freezing!”
 
  “It’s Friday,” Theo said, looking intently across the surface of the lake, “the Merpeople come to the lake surface on Friday afternoons. They used to have a weekly meeting with Dumbledore at this time, but obviously, that doesn’t happen anymore. Hagrid comes down to check in with them still, though. I thought you might like to see them. We’ve only got ten minutes or so to wait.”
 
  Hermione’s jaw dropped. “Oh wow!” she turned to face Theo on the bench, “how on earth do you know so much about magical creatures?”
 
  Theo shrugged. He pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket, shook one out, and lit it with a small blue flame that he conjured in his hand. “I like them,” he said, passing the flame to Hermione. “They're easier to understand than people are.” He looked down at the tree they were sitting on and blew smoke out of the side of his mouth away from her. “Generally, the people in my life have been a bit shit. Creatures have never been. Can you use that to get the Devil’s Snare out, please? It will warm your hands up nicely too.”
 
  Hermione watched him for a minute, then looked down at the dancing flames in her hands. She felt saddened by his words. “Hopefully, not all the people in your life are like that,” she said softly, “especially now.”
 
  “You're not,” he asserted with a smile, reaching over to take her free hand. “Neither is Draco, although if he were here now, he’d kick my arse for smoking because he hates it, I can’t have him thinking I’ve lost my rebellious streak though, can I?”
 
  “Heaven forbid!” Hermione teased. She waited for him to let go of her hand, then turned to sit sideways on the tree and brought the enchanted flame carefully up to his hair.  The few remaining Devil’s Snare leaves cringed away from the light, shriveled up, and fell to the floor. “Have you told Hagrid you’re interested in the merpeople?” she asked, “I'm sure he’d introduce you.”
 
  “I very much doubt that!” Theo said incredulously, making Hermione frown in confusion.
 
  “Why not?” she shivered, despite the bluebell flames in her hand as a particularly sharp gust of wind cut through the forest. “Thanks,” she said as Theo cast a warming charm over them both. 
 
  “Hagrid hates me,” he said derisively, as though it were obvious.
 
  Hermione turned to look at him in surprise. “No, he doesn't! Why do you think that?”
 
  “Yes, he does, Hermione. He doesn't like any of us Slytherins much. Mainly I think that's Malfoy’s fault. Hagrid’s never forgiven any of us for the stunt Draco pulled with that damn hippogriff of his in third year. He views us all the same, even though that had nothing to do with me. I even told Draco off for that myself. I hate seeing any creatures being harmed.”
 
  Hermione turned back to the lake, still cradling the flames in her hand as she mulled over Theo’s words. She had been about to argue, but she realized that he was  right. Hagrid didn't particularly like any of the Slytherins. It seemed there was a lot of truth in what Draco and Pansy said. Slytherins were seemingly distrusted on principle wherever they went. 
 
  It hardly seemed fair.
 
  She started guiltily as another thought hit her. She, Harry, and Ron hadn’t been to see Hagrid since before the Cupid game had started. “I’ll take you with me next time we visit Hagrid,” she asserted. “I’ll introduce you, and you can both start anew. He likes us, Harry, Ron, and me, I mean. I’m sure he’ll change his mind about you once he gets to know you too. Maybe we won't take Draco with us the first time we go, though.”
 
  Theo laughed. “Alright, you’re on. But I’m not holding my breath, and if he doesn’t change his mind, you can’t say it will be a surprise.”
 
  “Okay,” Hermione agreed, playing idly with the flame as Theo finished his cigarette then vanished the end. “You do know Buckbeak survived, don’t you? The hippogriff in third year,” she clarified at his blank look.
 
  “No, I thought the Ministry killed him!”
 
  Hermione shook her head, beginning to tell the story. “Look!” Theo pointed across the surface of the lake, where various circular ripples were forming. “Sorry to interrupt, but the merpeople are coming closer to shore.” 
 
  Hermione gasped as she followed his gaze. Despite spending an hour in the lake as part of the Triwizard Tournament in their fourth year, Hermione had never actually seen a real, living merperson. Dumbledore had put her and Ron into an enchanted sleep for the contest’s second task, ensuring that they both slept through the entire experience and therefore had no recollection of it at all. She smiled as she told Theo all about it. 
 
  “That's a damn shame,” he said, “I’d love to go in there for a proper look around. Do you reckon we could steal some Gillyweed from Slughorn and go for a swim one day?” He laughed at her look of horror, “I'll take that to be a no, shall I? Maybe I’ll ask Potter. He’s done it once already. Maybe we’ll wait until it’s a bit warmer too.”
 
  “You do that!” Hermione shuddered. Swimming in the depths of the Black Lake did not sound appealing at all. As they lapsed into silence, they watched Hagrid appear, crashing noisily through the trees with Fang at his heels. He settled down on his knees at the water’s edge then poked a stick rather abruptly into the water. 
 
  To Hermione’s amazement, a wild-haired, grey-skinned merman broke the surface, looked briefly around then started to screech in what Hermione recognized to be Mermish. 
 
  The conversation he held with Hagrid was brief. A mermaid popped her head out of the lake to join him and to give her contribution to the discussion, then both merpeople disappeared back under the iron-grey surface of the lake. 
 
  Hagrid paused for a few more seconds, looking out over the lake in the direction they had gone before slowly getting up and walking away with Fang following behind him.
 
  “That was amazing!” Hermione said. Although it had been a brief encounter and she hadn’t had a terribly good view, it was undoubtedly the closest she had ever consciously been to the merpeople. 
 
  Theo smiled as he led her back towards the castle. “So,” he said, with a very devilish grin, “Dean and Seamus. Tell me all about Lavender’s master plan, you know, the one that you are absolutely and very definitely not gossiping about.” 

  
  
  
  “I’m not going in!” Lavender announced as the usual group of people gathered outside the Room of Requirement later that evening. “As soon as myself or Dean step through that door, we’ll be eliminated, and I’m leaving this game on my own terms. A flashing neon light is not kicking me out.”
 
  “Here here, Lav,” Seamus said in his broad Irish brogue, “I couldn’t agree more.”
 
  “But we 
  
    can’t
  
   just leave,” Dean said, sounding frustrated, “we already tried that, and it didn’t work. Theo said, you could only leave if you have a moral objection to the game like Cho Chang did, but neither of us has that, do we, Lav?” 
 
  “Well, one of us is just going to have to kiss someone else then. Aren’t we?” Lavender looked around as if sizing people up. Hermione fought against the eye roll she was so desperate to perform, Theo, it seemed, had outdone himself this evening. “But there’s no one else here who’s single!”
 
  “I’m here,” Seamus said, stepping cheerfully forward. Lavender sighed in mock relief. 
 
  “Come on then, Sea,” she held out a hand as Seamus’ hazel eyes glinted with mischief.
 
  “Let’s do it then, lass,” Seamus smiled as Lavender approached. Hermione turned,  frowning at Theo in confusion, but he just grinned straight back. His attempted look of innocence didn’t fool her in the slightest, however. Lavender pressed her lips to Seamus,’, and Hermione’s suspicions were confirmed. As she watched, Draco waved his wand discreetly over the leaderboard that Theo held face down in his arms. 
 
  “Sorry, that didn’t appear to work either.” Theo smiled sweetly, glancing discreetly at the board while concealing it from everybody else. “The board believes that was a staged kiss. This particular get out clause requires a kiss with real feelings or desire behind it. Why don’t 
  
    you
  
   try kissing Seamus, Dean?”
 
  Dean gave a loud sigh followed by a groan. He spun in a circle before dropping his forehead onto the wall. “You lot are about as subtle as bloody house-bricks,” he huffed, although Hermione could see he was hiding a half-smile. 
 
  “Yep.” Theo grinned, “you’re right. Subtlety does not seem to be a Gryffindor trait.”
 
  “You’re not Gryffindor!” Dean grumbled.  
 
  “Neither is he subtle,” Draco agreed with a smirk. “Dean, Seamus. Kiss, please. We’re going to get caught if we loiter in the corridor for much longer.”
 
  “The map’s clear mate, don’t rush into anyth-” Harry broke off with a yelp as Pansy stood sharply on his foot. 
 
  “The map is not clear, Potter!” Pansy said indignantly. “Teachers are swarming everywhere. Come on, boys. Half of this bloody group is queer, in case that’s what you’re worried about. Now fucking well kiss!”
 
  That was enough to make Dean and Seamus both laugh. Finally, Seamus shrugged his shoulders, silently inviting Dean to come to him. Blushing furiously, Dean stepped forwards into his embrace, and a loud cheer went up as their lips finally met. 
 
  Draco lifted his silencing spell as Theo turned the leaderboard around. Immediately it went haywire. Lavender pulled it out from under his arm, flashed him a grin of thanks, then nodded with satisfaction at the bright red, neon light that was flashing their disqualification to the world. Theo silenced the board again and opened the door, standing back to let everyone else troop inside. Everyone except, Hermione noticed with a smile, Dean and Seamus, who were still kissing.
 
  Ginny reached out an arm, grabbed Dean by the back of his shirt, and pulled him into the room. Seamus followed, licking his kiss-swollen lips as he grinned rather sheepishly at Dean. 
 
  The room wasn’t split in half this week. One drinks trolley stood in the center of the new, single room and another piece of parchment with instructions written on it was pinned to the drinks trolley. 
 
  
    “This week's theme is skills exchange,” 
  
  Theo read.
  
     “Tonight, you must each demonstrate or describe a skill that was taught to you by your partner or partners over the course of the previous week. If a skill is of a sensitive nature, you must remember not to speak of it outside of this room.”
  
 
  “There you go then, boys and girls,” Theo asserted as the parchment burst into flames. It’s time for a bit of showing off.” 

   

  As usual, Pansy and Ginny took over the drinks trolley, busying themselves making and handing out drinks that contained much more firewhiskey than mixer. Once everyone was settled down, the room started to glow brightly with Patronuses. Hermione’s otter, Harry’s stag, Pansy’s flamingo, Draco’s thestrall, and Theo’s lioness all frolicked happily together, while a host of other animals chased each other around the now brilliantly lit room. 
 
  The only people who still couldn’t cast a Patronus were Greg and Daphne. Hermione smiled with satisfaction as she heard Harry volunteer to teach them over the coming days.
 
  Ron and Millie held a karate demonstration, Ron wasn’t all that bad for a beginner, but Millie was clearly much, much better. Ron grinned good-naturedly from the floor as Millie quickly took him down for the second time, then held out a hand to help him up again. “And that, ladies and gents, is why you don't ever mess with a girl!” Pansy said with satisfaction. 
 
  Later in the evening, Hermione accepted a refill of whatever drinks concoction Ginny and Pansy were now making and giggled as she felt the effects of the alcohol hit. She and Luna recounted the story of meeting the unicorn in the forbidden forest, Hermione added in the tale of the merpeople in the lake, from that afternoon, then they watched as Luna and Pavarti demonstrated a traditional Indian dance. 
 
  When Luna and Pavarti’s display finished, Pansy pulled Harry up to demonstrate the classical waltz she had taught him. Harry outdid himself, only stepping on Pansy’s feet twice, and both times she just grinned as she steadied him, not missing the opportunity to give him a heated kiss.
 
  Hannah blushed as she played the few guitar chords that Greg had taught her and giggled at the round of applause her efforts prompted. 
 
  Hermione smiled as everyone's demonstrations came to an end. She finished her drink feeling very relaxed and so at ease with her friend’s company that when a game of illuminated pairs quidditch was suggested, she eagerly agreed to play for the first time in her life. 

  
  

  
  

  Which was how she found herself clinging onto Draco’s Firebolt for dear life as he swooped like a rocket through the moonlit sky. He cast a silencing spell over her as she screamed, laughing somewhat guiltily then pulling up to hover in mid-air. “Sorry. I had to silence you, or we’d have all the teachers coming out to see what was going on. I thought I saw the snitch.” 
 
  “They haven’t released that yet!” she said, swatting at his arm as her heart rate gradually returned to normal. 
 
  “Would you prefer to fly with Theo?” Draco asked, stroking her arm gently, “although he is playing chaser right now, so he’ll be in the middle of everything, and I’m not sure if that would be any less alarming.”
 
  “No, it’s fine. Just, you know, warn me next time you do that, please. Anyway, doesn’t Theo usually play beater?”
 
  Draco wrapped his arms around her, holding her tightly as he nodded. “He does. But you know,” he gestured around them with his hand, “It’s dark. Bludgers are black. We’ve left them in the box. Safety first, Hermione.”
 
  She snorted with laughter as the game properly began. Even without bludgers, it was highly competitive and Hermione, having never paid too much attention to the rules or subtleties of quidditch, found that she had no idea of what was going on. “Keep looking for the snitch,” Draco said in her ear as they scanned the dark night for a glimpse of its glowing wings, “They are 
  
    not 
  
  winning tonight.”
 
  “Oh yes, we are Malfoy!” Pansy grinned, swooping past on the front of Harry’s broom. “Potter bests you nearly every time.”
 
  “Not tonight, Pans,” Draco said with a smirk. Hermione shivered with a thrill of anticipation at his determined tone. She hadn’t thought she was very competitive before now, but suddenly she wanted to win just as much as Draco did. 
 
  “Hermione’s my good luck charm,” Draco continued. “In fact, hold tight,” he dropped his voice to a whisper as he spun the broom on a sixpence, “there it is!” Hermione, with her limited flying experience, shrieked once more as Draco accelerated. She’d had no idea how fast a Firebolt could actually fly. Draco pressed her down close to the handle, and she gasped as the broom accelerated to what felt like the speed of light. 
 
  Harry and Pansy were shadowing them, though, and the gap between them was closing. “Faster!” Hermione squealed, finally seeing what Draco had long ago noticed, the tiny snitch, glowing at the far end of the pitch.”
 
  “Nooooo!” She gasped, grabbing frantically at the broom handle as the whole thing jolted violently. Looking to the side, she saw that Harry had dropped back and Pansy had grabbed hold of their tail. 
 
  “Off you get Pans!” Draco merely laughed, flicked the tail of the broom up, and scooted forwards as Pansy swore loudly. Harry accelerated, and they ended up neck and neck again, both racing flat out. Hermione forgot her nerves as she lay flat against the broom handle with Draco pressing into her back. “Reach for it!” Draco whispered, and she stretched out her arm just as Pansy did the same thing. 
 
  Their fingers brushed in mid-air. Pansy slapped at her hand, and before she knew what she was doing, she hit straight back. Pansy squawked indignantly just as Harry shot forwards, and Pansy, whose catching skills were far better than Hermione’s, closed her 
  fingers triumphantly around the snitch. “Bugger!!” Draco announced, laughing as he sat up, and both he and Harry slowed their breakneck pace.
 
  “I got it!!!” Pansy shouted, holding her hand up victoriously as Harry laughed. 
 
  “Sorry, ‘Mione,” Harry said, but she found she didn’t mind. She sat back against Draco, laughing with exhilaration at what they had just done. When they had all spiraled lazily back down to the ground, she accepted Pansy’s conciliatory hug, taking the still struggling snitch from her and staring at it in wonder as it flapped its wings furiously against her palm. 
 
  “I’m amazed,” Ron said, landing beside them with Millie, “what the hell happened up there, ‘Mione? You?” he pointed to the sky then looked back at her in confusion, “since when were you happy to fly like that?” 
 
  She laughed, adrenaline still coursing somewhat uncontrollably through her body. “I have no idea,” she admitted, feeling rather dazed by the whole experience. ”I’m not sure where any of that came from at all!”
 
  She was still feeling exhilarated when they finally made it into bed at one o clock in the morning. She settled down between the boys and didn’t object in the slightest, despite the lateness of the hour, when Draco tugged her insistently underneath him, and Theo propped himself up on one elbow to watch.
 
  
    Chapter Text
    
  “Flying? Playing quidditch? Racing Pansy for the snitch? Honestly, Kitten, what’s happened to you lately?” Sirius grinned, tipping his chair back on two legs as he teased Hermione in Grimmauld Place’s kitchen. Remus reached out a hand, and without even looking, pushed his chair back down, making Sirius roll his eyes and Hermione and Ginny laugh.
 
  “I truly have no idea,” Hermione admitted, yawning widely as she accepted the sausage baguette that Ron put in front of her. “Thank you. We stayed up until three in the morning as well. It just, I don’t know, some kind of weird competitiveness took me over when I was up there. Draco was in control of the broom. I knew I was safe, so I just kind of let go-” she broke off, blushing furiously as she noticed everyone in the room staring at her with varying degrees of amusement on their face.
 
  “There’s that control thing again, Theo,” Draco said smugly as he accepted his own plate from Remus. “Thanks. I told you, didn’t I?”
 
  “Mhmm, you did,” Theo’s grin made Hermione’s blush deepen. He closed his hand over hers with a wink. “Duly noted.”
 
  “Oh please!” Ron grumbled as he flipped the last of the sausages over in the pan, “enough!”
 
  “Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it, Weasley,” Theo switched his grin to Millie, who also blushed then glared straight back at him, “You might find I’m not the only one who’s into that sort of thing.” 
 
  “No, you’re definitely not the only one,” Ginny paused halfway through, buttering a baguette to slip her arms around Blaise’s neck and throw Hermione a wink of her own. 
 
  “So!” Remus looked amused as he rescued Hermione and Millie from the rather incriminating conversation, “have you all had a good week? I must say, our hangover potion supplies appreciate being given a rest!”
 
  “Oh, yes, about that. Here you go,” Draco said, reaching into his coat pocket to pull out a tied wrap of glass potion vials, “replenishments.” 
 
  “Thanks.” Remus nodded, adding the new vials to the depleted supply in the cupboard. “That’s much appreciated. Neither Sirius nor myself are great at brewing potions. Did you make these yourselves?”
 
  “Yes,” Draco said, “although it’s tricky doing it at school, Snape used to turn a blind eye when we were downstairs in the dungeon common room, but up where we are now, it’s different. McGonagall pokes her nose in all over the place these days.”
 
  “Well, you could always set up a brewing space here if you like?” Remus glanced at Sirius, who nodded as he chewed, “Merlin knows we’ve got enough space. I hear you have a pretty good hand with potions, Draco. You could help us out with the wolfsbane too. That is if you didn’t mind?” 
 
  “I, umm…. Yes, please, and yes, I’d be happy to help you with that. Thank you.” Draco looked touched as he furrowed his brow in surprise. 
 
  “No problem,” Remus acknowledged. “Anyway, you were going to tell us about your week?”
 
  “We’ve had an excellent week apart from the notes we found last Sunday,” Hermione admitted, and she watched Sirius and Remus’ faces fall as she explained about the latest round of parchments. 
 
  “Well, that’s scandalous!” Sirius exclaimed. “Are you boys all right?”
 
  “Yeah,” Draco sighed, “we are now. I was pretty freaked out at first. I think that particular note got to Theo as well, more so than the first one did anyway. It’s not particularly nice having your rap sheet paraded about in the open like that.”
 
  “No.” Sirius looked thoughtful, “I can’t imagine it would be. Mine’s tucked away in a drawer upstairs somewhere. I bet mine beats yours any day, though.”
 
  Theo looked up with a smirk, “Oh hell, yeah, I forgot about that! What’s on yours?”
 
  “I’m a convicted mass murderer, remember,” Sirius said with only a trace of bitterness in his voice. Remus stepped up behind him to put a hand on his arm and Sirius leaned back into his touch, “so thirteen counts of murder give or take, and a few unforgivables. Although how anyone can say I was convicted when I didn’t even get a trial,” he closed his eyes, breathed in deeply through his nose then sighed, opening his eyes with a grimace. “Anyway. Enough about my convictions, What did Hermione say about yours?”
 
  “She was amazing,” Theo admitted, looking at her lovingly as he stroked her hand again, “as always.”
 
  Hermione smiled through her mouthful of baguette. “Good,” Remus said, letting Sirius go. He passed out the final baguettes then also sat down to eat. “Are you any closer to working out who’s behind the notes?”
 
  “Nope,” Hermione frowned. “There’s a suspicious group of Ravenclaw girls that keep giving us dirty looks, but at the moment, that’s all we’ve got to go on.”
 
  “It’s getting more serious now,” Remus said thoughtfully, “Parading someone’s criminal records around without a person’s consent is almost a crime in itself. I wonder what they’ll do next.”
 
  “I’m hoping that’s it, to be honest,” Draco admitted, “I don’t want any more of my skeletons dragged out of the closet for the whole world to see.”
 
  “Have you thought about going to McGonagall?” Remus asked, and the entire table, including Sirius, turned to look at him incredulously. “No, alright, Merlin, steady on, it was only a thought!”
 
  “Not one of your best, though, Moons” Sirius grinned as Remus just shrugged and bit into his baguette.

  
  

  
  

  Hermione, Draco, and Theo spent another lovely Saturday with Sirius and Remus. Harry and Pansy stayed with them, and with the constant drizzle making the outside world too grey and dreary for doing much else, they decided to go Christmas shopping in muggle London. 
 
  Looking at the festive Christmas displays, Sirius said, was the perfect way to take their mind off of the notes on such an unpleasantly wet afternoon. Hermione thought briefly of her three remaining essays and sighed. So much for her previous days pledge to spend more time studying.
 
  “We’ll do them tomorrow. That’s a promise,” Draco whispered as they pulled on their coats. “I need to finish mine too. We’ll leave Theo in bed unless he wants to study with us. That way, we can get them done without distraction.”
 
  Hermione laughed as she wound a scarf around her neck. “How did you know I was worrying about schoolwork?”
 
  “Projective Legilimency,” Theo muttered from behind her. “The whole room probably heard your thoughts, love. A nice lie in sounds perfect. Although I have no idea what you mean about me distracting you, as if I’d do that!”
 
  “Hmm. Think about it, Theo, the whole bed to yourself for the 
  
    whole
  
   morning….” Draco said, catching Theo briefly by the hand.
 
  “He laughed, “I’m already picturing it, mate. I’m waving you two off and going straight back to sleep. It sounds amazing.”
 
  “Hmph,” Hermione grumbled, then nodded at Draco, who laughed. “Fine. But they are 
  
    all 
  
  being done tomorrow, and I don’t care how tempting either of you proves to be. I’m not going to be distracted by anyone!” 
 
  She held Draco’s hand as they walked through the crowded streets, avoiding puddles and traffic spray. They took their time looking at the festive displays in the shop windows and buying presents for friends and family. Hermione spent most of the money she’d exchanged in Gringotts at the start of their trip, and by the time they arrived back at the entrance to Diagon Alley with their arms laden with shopping bags, she was thoroughly pleased with her afternoon. She’d managed to buy Christmas presents for most of the people in her life and therefore felt a lot better about the missing yet more study time.
 
  “I’m not staying in here,” Sirius muttered, looking furtively around him as they entered the Leaky Cauldron, “all anyone does is gawk at me in here, and I’m not in the mood for that today. I’m all for grabbing a drink but let’s go down into Knockturn instead. Can we please?”
 
  “Fine by me,” Draco said with noticeable relief. Hermione refused to let go of his hand, so he pulled her rapidly through the pub and out the other side as a whole host of patrons did indeed turn to stare in their direction.
 
  “Phew!” Harry breathed once they were standing outside in the driving rain again, “even I feel uncomfortable in there these days!” 
 
  “Well, let’s see, now,” Remus grinned as Draco finally unclenched the vice-like grip he held on Hermione’s hand, “we’ve got Harry Potter and Hermione Granger out with Draco Malfoy, Theo Nott, Sirius Black, and a werewolf. The only one who gets out of this situation fairly easily is you, Pansy.”
 
  “Uh-huh,” she shook her head mischievously, “don’t forget I’m the one who tried to hand Harry over to You Know Who in the battle. The world hates me for that just as much as it hates you lot. The mere fact that I’m going out with Harry now raises plenty of eyebrows, believe me!”
 
  “Ah, welcome to the club then, Pans,” Theo said, holding out his hand for a high five.
 
  “Yeah, actually,” Sirius stopped walking to stare at her for a moment, “about that,” he laughed at her look of horror, “Oh come on, I’m only teasing, you’re treating him well now, so I’ll overlook that minor transgression of yours.” 
 
  They followed the bright, Christmassy shops along Diagon Alley, then, after a quick stop at Flourish and Blotts at Hermione’s and Draco’s request, turned the corner into Knockturn. Hermione looked around with a shiver, feeling just as conspicuous down here as the boys did in Diagon.
 
  The shops along Knockturn Alley were very different from the ones in Diagon. Some did admittedly have Christmas displays in their windows, but it was still apparent that they were in an area where dark magic prevailed. Bourgin and Burke’s had adapted to the seasonal cheer by draping dull purple tinsel around their mysterious artifacts, Cobb and Webbs had sprayed fake snow over everything, and Shyverwetch’s Venom shop had a specific display labeled “Christmas Poisons.”
 
  Hermione blinked, shaking her head as they approached the steep stone steps of the Whyte Wyvern pub. Theo paused to look in the next door tattoo shop’s window. “Here, look Pad’s,” Remus said, laughing as he pointed out a particularly cliched design of a werewolf howling at the full moon, “how about adding this to your collection? You’ve not had any new ones for a while!” 
 
  “These are terrible!” Theo agreed with a frown. “I’ve told Blaise he needs to finish training with his stepdad then open his own shop when we leave school. His designs are so much better than these. And they move!”
 
  “Which is why you're practically covered in tats, but you won’t let Blaise near you with his own gun, is it?” Draco asked.
 
  “I think I might,” Pansy said thoughtfully. “I really want one, and yours are so much better than these, Theo.”
 
  “Yeah, I think I might relent too, actually, especially after our last trip to Italy, his are practically as good as his stepdad’s now,” Theo admitted, helping as Pansy pulled his hand out of his pocket, pushed up his sleeve and showed Sirius the way the snake moved when it was activated.
 
  “Seeing that one, I might let Blaise have a go on me too.” Sirius raised his eyebrows, looking impressed as they climbed the steps and opened the door to the much more inviting looking pub. 

  
  

  
  

  It was almost dinner time when they finally stepped back into Grimmauld Place. “Would anyone mind if I offered to cook tonight?” Pansy asked rather shyly. “Only I love 
  cooking, and I never get a chance to do any, what with meals being provided at school and me not being allowed in the kitchen at my family’s manor?”
 
  “Why on earth aren’t you allowed in the kitchen?” Hermione frowned. Remus opened a bottle of wine as she unfurrowed her brow and started passing glasses out of the cupboard to Harry.
 
  “I’m allowed to cook on the elves' night off. But that’s one night a month, and even then, the interfering little buggers won't leave me alone,” Pansy grumbled.
 
  “Be our guest,” Remus said, gesturing around the enormous kitchen as Pansy smiled, “I went shopping yesterday. The cupboards and fridge are full.”
 
  “Thank you!” Pansy looked delighted as she started opening cupboard doors and selecting the ingredients she wanted. Hermione stayed to help, and both she and Pansy shooed the boys out of the room with a laugh. “Where would I find a chopping board and a knife?” Pansy asked, looking around a moment later. “Maybe we were a bit hasty in throwing everyone out. Where the hell do they keep everything?”
 
  Hermione opened the cutlery drawer then gestured to the chopping board rack. “I mostly know,” she said, starting to slice the onion Pansy had given her.  A brief pang of worry about her still outstanding essays washed over her as the rhythmic chopping allowed her mind to clear, but she pushed it aside, reassuring herself with Draco’s earlier promise. She would finish her outstanding homework tomorrow and not worry about it anymore today. Life seemed to be much better when she achieved a good balance between schoolwork and relaxing.
 
  Once dinner was cooking in the oven, she and Pansy wandered upstairs. Harry, Draco, and Remus were in the lounge, drinking wine and watching quidditch on the television. Sirius and Theo were nowhere to be seen. “Outside,”  Draco said, nodding towards the back door, and Hermione turned away as Pansy settled down next to Harry.
 
  “Knock knock?” she said, poking her head out the door, “wow, this is cozy!”
 
  “Hey Kitten, you coming to join us?” Sirius indicated another bottle of wine, and she nodded. Since she had left her first glass in the kitchen, he conjured a new one, filling it for her as Theo moved over on the swing seat. She settled in beside him, and he wrapped his arms around her as she sipped the rich Merlot. The patio area was warm, the windowed roof was strung with sparkling fairy lights, the firepit was burning merrily, and as Theo pulled a fleece blanket over them both she felt warm, comfortable, and very content indeed.
 
  “Have I interrupted?” she asked, sensing that Theo and Sirius’ conversation had stopped when she’d arrived and hadn’t yet resumed.
 
  “Nope,” Theo stroked her arm under the blanket. “Not at all. We were talking about hippogriffs. Did you know Buckbeak is living in Wales on Charlie Weasley’s new dragon reserve?”
 
  “Yes.” She nodded, “he was a bit conspicuous when he was living here in the middle of London. The lack of flying space was making him grumpy too. Charlie took him to Romania first, then brought him to Wales when he opened up his own reserve.”
 
  “I’m glad Buckbeak survived. Myself and Draco fell out big time over that. It’s about the only proper fight we’ve ever had,” Theo admitted thoughtfully. “I know you think I should study more, Hermione, but I’m never going to be academic. That’s the kind of job I want too, working outside with some kind of magical creatures, not necessarily dragons or hippogriffs, just some kind of magical animals.”
 
  Hermione smiled. “I can see you doing that. You’d be good at it too. I’ll definitely introduce you to Hagrid next week, I promise.”
 
  “Thanks. Sirius just invited us all here for the Christmas holidays, as well. I said it was up to you, but in a choice between coming here, going to Italy where Blaise’s mother will keep trying to seduce me, or staying at Hogwarts, I think I'd prefer to come here.”
 
  Hermione turned to beam at Sirius, “did you really?! That's amazing, thank you so much, yes please, I'd love to. Oh,” she paused, “but, what about Draco?”
 
  “I imagine he’d be fine with it too,” Theo said, “it’s Hogwarts, Italy or France for him too, and Narcissa isn't exactly his first choice of company. She’s always far too busy with “society,” Theo wiggled his fingers into air quotes then pulled a disgruntled face, reminding Hermione strongly of Sirius and his objections to most pureblood Wizarding traditions. She smiled as she was struck again by their similarities. “He’ll visit Narcissa, no doubt, but I can't see him wanting to spend the whole holidays with her. He also probably won’t want to spend too much time dodging Blaise’s mum’s advances either.”
 
  Hermione’s eyes opened wide, “Merlin, Blaise’s mother sounds, umm….” she sipped her wine rather than finishing her sentence.
 
  “The woman’s a bloody nightmare. Thanks,” Theo accepted a top-up of wine and a cigarette from Sirius, “She’s, well, I think Blaise better finish that tattoo training pretty quick, let’s put it that way. I don’t think Christos will last much longer. He’s had three years of marriage. That’s about the limit for Carmen Zabini.”
 
  Even Sirius blinked in surprise at that declaration. “In that case, If you're all happy with the idea of coming here, I'd love to. Thank you, Sirius. Have you asked Harry?” Hermione asked, trying to steer the conversation back onto safer ground.
 
  “I will when we go back inside,” Sirius said, “but they're all watching sport, and it's peaceful out here listening to the rain. Remus will only sit out here in the summer. It’s nice to have company.” Hermione nodded, watching the rivulets of rain run down from the roof then drip into the muddy flower beds. “I’ll take you to Wales in the holidays too if you like,” Sirius offered, “Charlie said we could pop in anytime, so I’ll be able to introduce you to Buckbeak. Have you ever flown on a hippogriff?”
 
  “Oh wow! Yes please, and no, I haven’t,” Theo laughed as Hermione shuddered, remembering her only Hippogriff flight, on Buckbeak in one of Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons. It had been far more terrifying than flying on a broomstick had ever been. 
 
  “Hey!” Theo nudged her, “remember, I can hear your thoughts if you shout them like that. Anyway, you used to feel that way about brooms, and there you were yelling at Draco to fly and dive faster last night.”
 
  Hermione felt herself blush. “Brooms are very different to hippogriffs. Wales sounds lovely, so yes, please, although I’m just stating now, I will not be riding any hippogriffs while we’re there.”
 
  “Deal.” Sirius grinned, then threw his head back, laughing as he caught Theo’s following words. Hermione flushed scarlet yet again, burying her face in her wineglass as Theo grinned shamelessly. 
 
  “I only said I’d give you something different to ride, love. I could just as easily have been talking about a broom.”
 
  Mercifully the sound of the door opening distracted them, and they all looked around as it opened. Draco did a double take seeing the three of them sitting snuggled up under blankets. Remus shunted Sirius over, then settled in beside him, leaning forwards to warm his hands over the firepit while Draco sat down on Hermione’s other side. “We’re making Christmas plans Re,” Sirius winked at Hermione as she composed herself. “I’ve invited them all to us for the holidays.”
 
  Remus’ face lit up in a broad smile as Draco widened his eyes. “We’ve said yes,” Hermione said, “depending on what you want to do, Draco,”
 
  Draco looked visibly affected as he stared back at Sirius and Remus. “Are you sure you want us all?” he asked, and they both nodded in reply. “In that case, there’s nowhere else I'd rather be.”
 
  “That’s it settled then,” Sirius smiled. “We’ll ask Harry and Pansy in a sec, and we can throw the invite open to anyone else who wants to come too.”
 
  Pansy’s dinner was spectacular. She and Hermione had made pan fried fish with roasted vegetables and steamed green beans. For pudding, Pansy had whipped up a quick treacle sponge. Harry eyed her in delight as he dug in. Clearly, she had figured out that anything with treacle in was his favorite. 
 
  Harry and Pansy accepted Sirius and Remus’ Christmas offer without question. Hermione grinned to herself, suddenly finding herself looking forward to the holiday a lot more than usual.
 
  Once they had cleared away the dinner things with their stomachs feeling uncomfortably full, they glanced at each other and then eyed the floo with distaste. It was clear that Hermione wasn’t the only one who didn’t want to go back to Hogwarts. “Film?” 
  Sirius asked, and she laughed as everyone readily agreed. A quick call through the floo brought Ron, Millie, Ginny, and Blaise back to join them, and they all settled down together once more. 
 
  Nobody seemed to want to go back when the clock struck midnight either. Hermione reluctantly followed the boys back into the almost deserted common room then through to the Slytherin boys dorm. Happily, no notes were waiting for them this time. “I've never had a proper home, I don't think,” Theo said thoughtfully as he paused beside the bathroom door to let Hermione out, “not since my Mother died and my Father started drinking heavily anyway. You’ve never had the misfortune of seeing Nott Manor, Hermione. I’ll try not to inflict that horror on you, at least not until it’s sorted out a bit.” He stared at the floor as he sighed, “I like Sirius and Remus a lot. I’m glad we’ve got somewhere to go for Christmas.”
 
  Draco smiled sympathetically. He held his hand out to Theo, but Theo just stepped away, wiping his eyes surreptitiously as he went. Hermione turned sadly to face Draco once the bathroom door had shut, and Draco shook his head. “You think Malfoy Manor’s bad, Nott Manor is like a mausoleum in comparison. At least my mother kept our house vaguely feeling like a home even when 
  
    he 
  
  took up residence there. “Theo’s very similar to Sirius in a lot of respects.”
 
  “I noticed that too,” Hermione nodded, changing into her nightshirt then shivering as she slipped between the freezing cold sheets. Draco settled in beside her, and it was a long time before Theo emerged, blowing his nose and wiping his suspiciously red-rimmed eyes again. He said nothing as he settled in beside her. She wriggled backward into his embrace and sighed as he held her close, wrapping his arms around her in the way he did when he felt insecure.
 
  Hermione’s heart filled with love for both him and Draco as she lay watching the moonlight filter in through the blinds. Draco fell asleep very quickly, but Theo took a lot longer. Eventually, his breathing settled, and he dozed off, but even in his sleep, he held onto her tightly. Tonight, instead of fighting for her own space in the bed as she usually did, Hermione relaxed into his embrace, finally allowing herself to unwind now that she knew he was peaceful.
 
  It seemed that she was starting to know both boys very well. What scared her now was the depths of her feelings for them both. It had been four weeks since their unconventional relationship had begun. Four short weeks and yet, as she opened her eyes for one last time to gaze at Draco’s silky hair and Theo’s dark tattoos in the moonlight, she felt sure that she was falling in love with them both. 

    

  
  
  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    
  True to his word, Draco woke Hermione up in time for their planned study session the next morning. She groaned as she opened her eyes, squinting against the uncomfortably bright sunlight. “Morning, beautiful,” he said, smiling as she yawned widely. 
 
  She wriggled, carefully trying to move out of Theo’s embrace without waking him up. His arm was still tucked snugly around her in the same position it had been when they had settled down to sleep, and she frowned at it in confusion. Had they really not moved all night? If the dull ache in her lower back was to be believed, then apparently no, they hadn’t.  
 
  “He sleeps like the dead. You won’t wake him up by moving,” Draco whispered, looking amused at her predicament.
 
  “What time is it?” she asked sleepily, giving up trying to extract herself for a moment. Despite her stiffened limbs, she found she quite liked waking up in the position she was in. it was warm, snug, and she felt totally protected from the world.
 
  “Ten. I was going to wake you half an hour ago, but you both looked so peaceful that I couldn’t do it. But, I promised you a day in the library, so I thought we’d better make a start on that soon.” Draco sat back down on the bed, and Hermione couldn’t help but watch the movement of his tongue as he slowly licked his lips. He looked gorgeous, but then, didn’t he always? His hair was wild, still messy from sleep, his eyes held a relaxed, early morning look, and suddenly Hermione found that studying didn't seem so appealing after all. 
 
  She was momentarily taken back to her previous night’s thoughts. Was this really how it felt to fall in love, and if so, why did the feeling scare her so much? Pushing that concern away for another time, she bit down on her bottom lip then took a deep breath as her core clenched with desire. Draco’s eyes were dark and swirling, he looked to be 
  processing his own, similar emotions, and neither he nor Hermione spoke as they shared the long, heated moment. 

   

  “Right. Studying then. Unless….” she said eventually, breaking off to deliberately look him up and down. He was wearing a dark grey jumper teamed with black sweatpants, and the monochrome colors brought out the depths of the different shades of grey in his eyes, eyes that mirrored her own desire straight back at her….

   

  He smiled as he gently shook his head. “Later,” he whispered, bending down to brush his lips over hers. “Studying first, then we can do 
  
    whatever 
  
  you want afterward. For as long as you want. Theo and I have both got a few ideas in mind for you today.”

   

  Hermione’s next exhale turned into a whimper as arousal threatened to take her over. Without thinking, she ground her bottom backward into Theo. “Do that again, witch, and you won’t be making it out of bed to study for a while,” he tightened his arms around her as he rolled his hips forwards, pressing his rock hard erection against her to make her whimper yet again. 

   

  With a sly smile, Hermione pressed back into him once more, giggling as he growled softly. “I sleep naked for a reason Hermione,” his voice was still gravelly from sleep as he merely pulled her panties to one side then dipped a finger inside her wet heat. “Fuck!” he muttered as she gasped in response. Without another word, he sheathed himself smoothly inside her, making her cry out loudly. “If you tease me like that, this is what will happen.”

   

  Hermione giggled as Draco rolled his eyes. She watched him frown slightly as a male laugh and a feminine giggle sounded from behind Blaise’s neighboring bed hangings. In response he cast a silencing spell, then vanished his own clothing…...

  
    
    
  
  
  It was a testament to Draco’s strength of character rather than her own that they made it into the library before eleven. Theo had simply kissed them both goodbye then turned over to go back to sleep, Draco had waited quietly while she showered in record time, then they had both hurried down to the busy library. 

   

  Hermione pulled her books and parchments out of her bag. For the first time in her life, she felt reluctant to study when there were other far more pleasurable things that she could be doing. Her body was still tingling pleasantly from her earlier orgasm, and she couldn’t help regretting leaving the bed so hastily after it. 

   

  Finally, she lifted her quill, ready to make a start on the essays she had been putting off for so long. Once she began, it didn't take long to complete the first two. Her History of Magic and Arithmancy assignments both proved relatively straightforward, and after a hasty lunch, she settled back down to stare at her last Transfiguration piece. Dismay caused her to sigh heavily. This one was much more taxing than the others. Clearly it was going to take a while. Draco laid his astronomy charts out on the table and leaned back in his chair to study 
  them while Hermione frowned at Professor McGonagall’s fiendishly tricky questions on full human transfiguration. 
 
  Various people wandered in to join them as the afternoon progressed, and soon Harry, Pansy, Ron, Millie, Luna, Greg, Daphne, Astoria, and Tracy were all sitting with them in one big study group. “Afternoon,” Ginny said, strolling in with her waist-length hair soaking wet and her eyes alight with mischief, “alright, Hermione? Is that an essay on the correct timing of a silencing spell by any chance?”
 
  Hermione blushed as Draco leaned back in his chair. He fixed Ginny with an amused eyebrow raise, but she just smiled straight back at him. “You’re hardly one to talk,” he pointed out as Ron looked up in horror, “nor lecture, in fact.”
 
  Ginny’s smile widened as she set her study things down. “I would never lecture, Draco. And who says we don’t want to be overheard?”
 
  Draco gave an elegant snort. “That wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest with you 
  
    or
  
   Blaise.”
 
  Hermione forced her attention away from their bickering and back to her essay. She was finally finishing the last few paragraphs when Theo strolled casually into the library to join them an hour later. “Oh,” Draco said loud enough for him to overhear, “look what the cats dragged in.”
 
  “Afternoon,” Theo dropped his bag to the floor and stretched luxuriously. “How’s it going?”
 
  “I’m very nearly done, actually,” Hermione said, still scribbling furiously.
 
  “You'll get writer's cramp in a minute.” Theo took his notes out of his bag and sighed as he pulled a chair round to squeeze in beside her. He sat down, looking despondently at the large number of assignments in his hand.
 
  “What have you got to do?” Draco asked. 
 
  Theo pulled a disgruntled face. “Everything. Herbology, Astronomy, Potions, Divination, and Charms all due this week. Oh, and a few others that are already late.”
 
  “Would you like a hand with the Charms one?” Tracy asked, leaning across in her chair, “it’s the least I can do after you helped me out in Potions last week.” The scent of her rather sickly perfume tickled Hermione’s nostrils, and she fought the urge to wrinkle her nose in irritation. Tracy hadn’t offered to help anyone else all afternoon.
 
  “Please, love, I’d never say no to a bit of help.” Theo sorted through his stack of work then handed the right parchment over as Hermione bit her tongue to keep herself from saying anything inappropriate. Her resolve was tested further as Daphne took the remaining pile out of his hands, picked out another piece, whispered a handwriting spell to her quill, then settled down to finish it for him. 
 
  Hermione closed her eyes, breathing out slowly as she forced herself to calm down. She wasn’t usually the jealous sort. She really wasn’t, so why did she feel so uncomfortable with Theo, Tracy, and Daphne’s friendship all of a sudden? Ever since the day that Theo had apologized to Tracy for unceremoniously dumping her, the three of them seemed to have grown inordinately close, and it was putting her on edge.
 
  And why, she continued to think unreasonably, did Astoria have to wear such a low cut top to a Sunday afternoon study session? To be fair, it was more Ron and Greg who kept flicking their eyes in her direction, and Millie hardly seemed bothered by Ron’s wandering gaze, but Hermione had caught Draco looking a couple of times too. To give Theo his due, though, as far as she was aware, he hadn’t looked in Astoria’s direction once. 
 
  Hermione screwed her eyes tighter together, willing her uncharitable feelings to go away. “Are you alright? Draco asked, sensing her internal struggle.
 
  “Letting someone else do your homework for you is cheating!” she couldn't help but huff furiously. She could tell Draco she was annoyed with Theo for not doing the work himself, but she knew deep down that she wouldn’t be nearly so upset if it was Draco or Blaise that was helping him out.
 
  “Ah, it’s only a bit of writing,” Theo said, absently stroking Hermione’s arm, “I know all the answers, and they know I know the answers because 
  
    I 
  
  told 
  
    them 
  
  the answers earlier in the week when they were doing their own homework. So really, they're just writing my own work down for me. Think of it as a mutually beneficial arrangement.” 
 
  He gazed around the group, his eyes settling on Draco hopefully as he offered the remaining homework out. Draco just shook his head, looking as though he was quite used to this arrangement. “Fine, so, as no one else is going to help me, I shall just apply myself diligently to the rest of these and struggle on through myself,” he said, sounding so depressed by the thought that Hermione’s irritation eased slightly. 
 
  “Have you been in bed 
  
    all 
  
  day? She asked, glancing down at her own almost finished essay.
 
  “Of course not!” Theo retorted, looking scandalized. “Only the morning. I got up at half twelve and popped into Knockturn with Greg, Hannah, Tracy, and Daph. We grabbed some lunch, and here I am.”
 
  “You popped into Knockturn?” Draco frowned, looking at Hermione in concern as she gripped her quill rather harder than usual, “but we were there yesterday!”
 
  “Ah.” Theo nodded, “yes, we were. But I needed some fairly 
  
    specific things
  
  , and since we were shopping with the two men who guided Hermione so delicately through her teenage years, it didn’t feel quite right to buy them on that particular trip.”
 
  “Theo,” Draco paused in his essay writing to look at him in confusion once again, “What the fuck are you on about?”
 
  “Madam Carlotta’s, Draco. It’s sexual fetish week in the Cupid game.”
 
  “Ah!” Draco’s smirk was sinful, and despite her inner turmoil, Hermione’s breathing hitched at the sight of it. “Is it now?” 
 
  Theo nodded as he looked at Hermione uncertainly. “It is, but don’t get too excited. The prompts are all optional, not to mention extremely mild.” 
 
  “What’s Madam Carlotta’s?” Hermione asked, trying to keep her voice neutral. The bottom was threatening to drop out of her stomach. Daphne and Tracy had been to Knockturn Alley with him too? Was she honestly the only one who thought this was totally unreasonable?
 
  “It’s a wizarding sex shop,” Draco explained, looking at Hermione as if suddenly understanding why she seemed so upset.
 
  “As I said, though,” Theo paused to eye her with concern as she pushed her quill into the table so hard that it snapped, “the prompts are all very tame.” 
 
  “That’s a shame,” Hermione said, without thinking as she continued to seethe about Daphne, Tracy, and Astoria. She forced her eyes away from Theo and Draco who were both now watching her speculatively, and focused back on her homework instead.
 
  “What's a shame?” Draco asked.
 
  Hermione tutted at her own lack of discretion, “did I say that out loud?”
 
  “Mmhmm.” Theo said, his blue eyes sharpening considerably as he watched her, “You did. So is it a shame that it’s fetish week, a shame that the prompts are mild, or is something else bothering you?”
 
  Hermione sighed, doing her best to let the worst of her tension go. She wanted to keep her temper under control, and she needed some space to process her feelings properly. “Umm, I’m done here now. I need to go,'' she said shakily, grabbing her papers. She hastily shoved them into her bag then looked up to find Theo staring at her. The moment she made eye contact with him, she realized her mistake. She turned away, furious with herself for forgetting about his ability to read her thoughts without using deliberate Legilimency. Draco was staring at her sharply too, and the look of dawning comprehension on Theo’s face was suddenly too much for her to bear. She scooted her chair back and abruptly stood up. 
 
  “We need to talk about this,” Theo stood up as well, catching her hand to hold her in place. “You have got nothing to worry about, Hermione, 
  
    nothing. 
  
  I’m sorry okay, I had absolutely no idea that any of this was bothering you. You should have said something before it got to this stage.” 
 
  Hermione couldn’t speak. Most of the people at the table were now staring at her in concern, and as Theo let her hand go, she nodded once, turned, then left the library with as much dignity as she could muster. 

  
  
 
    

  “Knock Knock” Ginny’s voice sounded through the drapes around Hermione’s long-abandoned bed in the Gryffindor girls dormitories twenty minutes later. 
 
  Hermione rolled her eyes. So much for the privacy she’d been hoping for. “I’m not here,” she muttered pointlessly.
 
  “Good. We won’t come in then,” Ginny said just as grimly, pulling the drapes back and moving to sit on the bed with Pansy beside her. “Hermione, this is nuts. You just need to tell him you're not comfortable with them hanging around him so much. It’s not on. I’d hate it too if that were Blaise, and neither myself nor Pansy think you’re being unreasonable about this.”
 
  “They’ve always been close, those three, and Theo’s a terrible flirt.” Pansy conjured a box of tissues and passed one to Hermione. “He always has been, but if it’s upsetting you this much, then Ginny's right. You need to talk to him about it.”
 
  “And say what?” Hermione sat up defensively, hugging her knees into her chest as she blew her nose. There seemed to be no point denying what was wrong. Both Ginny and Pansy had come to find her for a reason after all. “Please, Theo, don’t see two of your best friends anymore because your girlfriend’s acting like an idiot? Pansy, you could say the same thing to Harry about myself and Ginny!”
 
  “I did!” the bed dipped as Pansy moved closer and handed her another tissue. “I told him I had a problem, and he listened to me, reassured me, and is a lot more careful about things now.”
 
  “Yeah, me and H haven’t laid on the same bed since!” Ginny quipped, catching the pillow that Pansy threw playfully at her.  
 
  Hermione sat up to stare at Pansy in shock. “You don’t think I'm being ridiculous then? More to the point, how do you both know what’s happened?”
 
  “No,” Pansy confirmed, “I don’t think you're being ridiculous. Not in the slightest. I already told you he’s a flirt, and that’s gotten him into trouble before, so he should have learned better by now. So rather than telling him your fine when he comes to find you, tell him you’re not, then let him sort things out.”
 
  “We know what’s happened because when you stormed out of the library, both Draco and Theo made to follow you. Harry and Ron caught up with them, and before they all had a duel in the corridor, we stepped in. Theo buggered off with Ron while Draco told us what was 
  wrong. And what’s more, I agree with Pansy,” Ginny continued. “I had no idea that she felt so threatened by my closeness to Harry until he told me, so between us, we sorted it out. We’re good now. I even hugged him the other day without thinking, and Pansy didn’t kill me for it.”

   

  “Yet,” Pansy said, narrowing her eyes as Ginny laughed. 

   

  “Do you think Draco minds the way Theo is?” Hermione asked, “or is it just me that’s getting upset by it?”

   

  “I’d guess Draco’s a little more tolerant of it because he knows Daphne and Tracy so well. He’d know their intentions aren’t to split you up or to cause trouble between you. It’s probably similar to how Ron views your closeness with Harry. He knows friendship’s all it is- Anyway,” Pansy said, breaking off as the dormitory door opened and Theo stood watching her contemplatively, “I think we’ll leave you to it.”

   

  Ginny pulled Hermione into a fierce hug, and Hermione gripped her tightly for a long moment in return. “See you in the meeting later.”

   

  “Ouch!” Theo exclaimed loudly as Pansy passed him, “Thanks, Pan’s, although I suppose that was thoroughly deserved.” He paused at the foot of Hermione’s bed, staring at her with a strange look on his face as he shook the stinging hex out of his arm. “Hey.”

   

  “Hey.” Despite her conflicted feelings, Hermione managed a small smile. “Are you okay?”

   

  Theo sighed as he dropped his eyes. “I should be the one asking you that. I’ve spoken to Draco, Harry, and Ron too, and they’ve all confirmed that I’ve been a little over-friendly towards Daph and Tracy lately. I’m sorry, Hermione, I had no idea that I was even doing it, and I certainly had no idea that it was causing you a problem. So, as a deal, Draco’s agreed to stop staring at Astoria’s newly acquired breasts, and I’m going to be more aware of my actions.”

   

  Hermione laughed weakly as she patted the bed beside her. “Thank you. In return, I will also be more mindful of my closeness to Harry and Ron because Pansy has just pointed out that it’s the same thing.”

   

  Theo’s smile was easy as he regarded her fondly. “Deal. Now, how are you feeling? Because I really want to lay down beside you, but I know exactly where that could lead, and I refuse to have sex with you when your feeling bad. Talking fixes problems, hiding them behind orgasms doesn’t.”

   

  Hermione looked up, impressed by his sensitivity. “You're right. I’m not feeling particularly great right now,” she admitted, watching as he moved to sit beside her. She laid her head on his shoulder, then switched her gaze to the window as a fresh wave of tears threatened. The sky was dark, and a quick glance at his illuminated watch told her they only had an hour left before the Cupid meeting. “Where’s Draco?”
 
  “In the common room. He’s giving us some privacy. He’s also putting off apologizing to you for staring at Astoria’s tits.” 
 
  Hermione nodded, looking down at her now shredded tissue with a sigh. “Are there 
  
    any
  
   feelings between you, Daphne, or Tracy? Is there anything at all that I need to worry about?” she asked quietly.
 
  “No!” Theo's response was emphatic. “I promise, there is nothing you need to worry about at all.” He broke off as he looked deeply into her eyes. “We’re just friends, and I also promise to be a lot more mindful of your feelings on the subject from now on. I’m truly sorry for being so oblivious to it up until now.”
 
  She nodded and they both sat quietly, lost in their own thoughts for a few minutes. “This bed’s dusty,” Theo patted the covers sadly. “You’ve not been here for a long time. Are 
  
    all
  
   of these tears because of me?”
 
  “Not all of them,” she admitted. “Sometimes, I get a bit emotional. I’ve always done it. I bottle things up for too long, and then it all comes out like this.”
 
  He nodded, furrowing his brow in concern as she tightened her fingers on the bedsheets. “What else is bothering you then?” 
 
  Hermione sighed, consciously relaxing her shoulders and letting go of some of the tension they held. “Can I ask you something?” she asked in a quiet voice as he nodded, taking her hand and lacing his fingers through hers. “How do you feel about me?”
 
  “Honestly?” he looked to be thinking about the question as he changed position again, stretching out to lay on his side and propping his head up on his hand to look at her. She turned around to face him more comfortably as he tugged gently on her hand, “I’m falling for you.” He stopped talking to grimace and stare at the bed, “ah fuck it, that’s only half of the truth. I’m falling in love with you, Hermione. A little bit more every day that passes. And I’ve been in love with Draco for years. So yeah, please don’t worry about Daph or Tracy. I’ve only got eyes for you two. Sweet fucking Merlin, woman, why has that made you cry again?!”
 
  This time Hermione couldn’t help giggling through her tears. “Because I thought Slytherins were meant to be indirect,” she said after a moment’s pause, “and you’re anything but!”
 
  Theo chuckled. “Yeah? Well, maybe I’m a rubbish Slytherin. Draco is much more guarded than me. I say what I feel. Anyway, on that note, I thought Gryffindors confronted their problems head on and didn’t bottle them up?”
 
  She laughed again as she exhaled. “Alright, you’ve got me there.” She wiped her eyes as she sighed yet again, this time with relief, and looked up into his honest eyes. She nodded once, and the slight prickle in the front of her mind told her that he understood. She was permitting him to look at what was really bothering her.
 
  “Why does the thought of falling in love scare you so much?” he asked gently after a moment. He left her mind, then switched his gaze to the bed drapes, “come in, Malfoy, I know you're loitering out there listening to what we’re saying.”
 
   “For fucks sake, Theo,” Draco grumbled from the other side of the curtains, “how the hell do you do that?”
 
  Theo just grinned. “Talent, mate. Do you want to join in our declarations of love?”
 
  Draco’s breathing hitched as he ruffled his hands through his hair then sat down. “I heard what you’ve both already said,” he admitted.
 
  “I know,” Theo said easily. 
 
  “You’ve been in love with me for years?” Draco asked, staring moodily down at his jeans. The tightness of his jaw was causing a vein to throb in his temple. Hermione watched it, absently wondering what it would feel like to kiss.
 
  Theo smiled as he nodded in confirmation. “Yes.”
 
  “Yeah, all right then. I’ll join in, but Merlin, this isn’t an easy thing for me to do.”
 
  “We know that as well.” Theo grinned, rolled over onto his back, and stared up at the ceiling. “I’ll go first if it helps. I love you alright? Both of you. There. That’s my cards all out on the table.”
 
  “I’m falling in love with both of you too,” Hermione admitted haltingly. 
 
  “And still looking completely terrified by that thought,” Theo teased, although he was smiling broadly at her confession now. “And, you’re also 
  
    still
  
   not explaining why falling in love scares you so much. Are we really that terrifying?”
 
  “I’ve loved you both for years, too,” Draco confessed before she had a chance to answer. “That in itself doesn’t scare me, but telling you both about it does because that puts it out there in the open, and now you know, so I understand why you're scared, Hermione, I am too.”
 
  “It’s not you two that scare me,” Hermione admitted, “It’s the feeling of love itself that I’m finding unnerving. When you love someone, they have power over you. They have the power to hurt you, and as the war proved to me time and time again, it hurts when you lose the people you-” she broke off as a considerable sob overcame her. In an instant, she felt Draco pull her against him and Theo’s arms close around the pair of them.
 
  “Listen to me.” Theo said into her hair, “we are not going anywhere. You're ours, and we’re yours. So, when we behave, sorry, I’ll rephrase that, when 
  
    I 
  
  behave like an idiot, and it starts to hurt you, you're going to tell me, and I’m going to stop doing whatever it is that’s causing the problem. I’ll not use it as an excuse, Hermione, but I didn’t have a mother to kick my arse when I was growing up. I know Harry didn't either, but he at least had a sensible-ish 
  personality. I grew up with my father, who was practically an alcoholic, no discipline boundaries, and a manor full of dark magic. Couple that with my defiant personality, and It’s a wonder I survived. Feel free to kick my backside when necessary, okay?” 
 
  Hermione sighed, smiling again as she finally got her tears under control. “Okay. Fine.”
 
  Draco looked up. “That goes for me too. I’m sorry for looking twice at Astoria this afternoon. It’s just that she seems different lately. Maybe she’s just growing up, but I can’t help feeling there’s something wrong. She’s not the type to flash her body around like that either, and without bringing up recently healed wounds, Daphne would usually tell her to cover up. Both of them are behaving a little out of character at the moment.”
 
  Hermione nodded. She didn’t need any more apologies. She accepted what both of them said. Neither of them had given her any cause to doubt their sincerity since their relationship had begun, so she resolved to trust them both more fully from now on. 
 
  After her brief uncharacteristic episode, she felt that she was ready to move on. “Draco, it’s fine. I accept both of your apologies. I’m not perfect either, so if anything I do upsets either of you, will you promise to tell me about it too?”
 
  “Yep,” Theo grinned, “that’s a deal. I’ll start with that right now, in fact. I hate that your wearing so many clothes-”
 
  Draco laughed as he twisted Theo’s wrist around to look at his watch. “The meeting starts in ten minutes. I think that will have to wait till afterward.”
 
  “Please don’t say anything to Daphne or Tracy,” Hermione said. “I appreciate you being more careful about your friendship, and I don’t want anything to be awkward between them and me. I do actually like Daphne as a person. Tracy too, although I don’t know her very well yet.”
 
  Theo nodded. “No problem. For the record, she likes you too. She told me so the other day when we had another one of those little chats that I will be much more mindful of in future. I’ll keep an eye on Astoria too, and make sure she’s okay. Come on now, your very quiet Draco. Is there anything else we need to talk about while we’re clearing the air?”
 
  “No.” Draco’s voice was muffled by Hermione’s hair as he held her tightly, “I’m good. Just so you both know, I don’t fall in love easily. You two have always been the ones for me. I might have been with other girls, Hermione, but I always wished they were you. And you know, Theo, you're the only man I’ve ever been with. There’s no one else I’ll ever want.”  
 
  “Good,” Theo whispered, stroking his hair back tenderly as Hermione untangled herself from both of them. “Now, let’s set the room up for tonight’s meeting, shall we? Some of the prompts for next week might interest you both.”

  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    
  Hermione followed Draco straight into the Slytherin boys' dorms after the evening’s Cupid meeting, then hopped up onto their shared bed to read the rolled up piece of parchment she had taken from the table of prompts. She shivered, allowing herself a small smile as she looked down at her chosen kink and remembered the other options that had been on the table….. 
 
  The Room of Requirement had been set up simply, with one table that held a choice of ten different parchment scrolls, each one containing written information on a different sexual fetish. Every couple had been tasked with choosing the kink they wanted to explore with their partner for the week ahead.
 
  Draco and Theo had both stepped back, informing Hermione that the only thing on the table that either of them objected to was group sex, simply because they both refused to let anyone else touch her. In all honesty, this revelation had been a relief after their earlier misunderstanding. She hadn’t felt keen to see either of the boys with anyone else either.
 
  She had stood at the table with the other remaining game participants as they all read through the available choices. The prompts had ranged from romance, with or without sex involved, right up to multiple partners, but Hermione’s choice had been easy. It had been something she had wanted to try for a while, and when she’d seen the corresponding card on the table, she had picked it up without a second thought. 
 
  Draco had merely grinned, but Theo’s eyes had nearly popped out of his head when she’d shown him her choice. “Dom/Sub? Hermione, are you actually trying to kill me?”
 
  “I hope not,” she’d replied with a grin of her own, “I’m very much hoping you’ll be alive to take the dom role because I quite fancy myself as your sub.”.... 
 
  Theo jumped up onto the bed beside her. He plucked the parchment out of her hand with a devilish smile that instantly turned her core to liquid fire. “There’s a list on here,” he said, turning the instructions over, “each option has a yes, no, or a maybe box and you both tick whatever feels right for you. That way, I have some ideas of which way and how far you want to go with this.” Hermione licked her lips as she nodded. Theo clicked his fingers, and two pens appeared, floating in mid-air in front of her and Draco. 
 
  “That’s a bit modern, isn’t it?” Draco laughed, squinting at the plastic pens, “whatever happened to quills?”
 
  “The ink gets messy in the bed.” Theo laughed, “now just tick your bloody list and quit moaning about writing equipment, will you please?”
 
  Draco laughed, leaning down, and after barely looking at his list, he put a tick in every single ‘yes’ box.
 
  “You
  
     can’t
  
   have read all of these properly!” Hermione’s eyes widened with surprise as she paused with her pen poised over her own list. She’d had no idea that this subject was so involved. 
 
  “No, I haven’t,” Draco admitted. “I did enough homework in the library earlier today. I trust Theo and I have a safeword. I’ve done a bit of this with him before anyhow, so he knows my feelings on it.”
 
  “Have you?” she looked back at the list with a shiver. The first few options were easy enough, Submissive role, hell yes. Dominant role, definitely not. Massage, yes. Sensory play, also an easy yes. Ropes and bondage, yes. Blindfolds, yes. Then they got onto the things she had no experience with. Spanking, her breath hitched ever so slightly at the thought, yes. Orgasm delay, maybe. No, she crossed maybe out and ticked yes instead, it had proved to be incredibly intense when they had tried that the previous week, but she had never felt a release like it. Anal sex, maybe. Wax play, perhaps. Oral sex (both giving and receiving) both yes. Sex toys, maybe. Sex magic, maybe.”
 
  She passed the list back to Theo, who glanced at it with a smirk. He looked up at her with a quirked brow, “you’ve only said a hard no to the dom role?” 
 
  She nodded. “I trust you to do that.”
 
  “Same.” Draco laid back on the bed, “Although I’ve not even said no to that. If we don’t like something, we’ll say. Don’t you have a list?”
 
  “I do,” Theo confirmed. “It’s yes to everything except the sub role, which I’m saying maybe to. If you want to play around with it, that is, Draco?”
 
  Draco smiled, “that I do. Yes, please. What’s happened to change your mind, though? You’ve never said that before,” Draco asked, fixing Theo with a challenging stare. 
 
  “I liked what you did with it last week,” Theo admitted with a grin. “So if you’ve got more of that in you, I’d be up for giving it a try.” Draco merely replied with a wink as he ran his hand over the bulge in Theo’s jeans. “Plus,” Theo added, “we’re all in a committed relationship now. My trust levels have gone up.” He smiled softly at Draco as he spoke, and in return, Draco nodded gently. 
 
  “Can you explain the sex magic part, please?” Hermione asked, settling back on the bed and looking up with interest. “Only I’m ticking maybe for it, but I don't really know what it is or what it involves.”
 
  Draco shifted closer to her as he started to explain. “It’s a vast subject, but it’s basically using magic to enhance your sexual experience. It’s a branch of mind magic that’s closely linked to the Dark Arts because it has its roots in the control side of things. For example, I could enchant a word so that every time you heard it, your arousal would increase. We could then use that word in dirty talk, and the use of that word alone could tip you over the edge-”
 
  “Have you already done that?” Hermione asked with a slight frown, “I’ve always wondered how you can both just tell me to come, and I do.”
 
  “No,” Theo chuckled, “that’s just us taking charge, and it shows that you’re naturally submissive because you respond to our tone of voice. We wouldn’t use sex magic on you without your express understanding and permission. It’s far too close to mind control to not have informed consent for it.”
 
  Hermione looked from Theo to Draco in alarm. “Is it illegal?”
 
  “No. Not unless it’s used without the other person’s knowledge and consent.”
 
  “I think that one stays as a maybe for now, then,” she said, handing the list back to Theo. 
 
  “That’s fine by me, sweetheart. Sex magic is Draco’s area of expertise anyway. My mind magic is far too sloppy for that.”
 
  “By contrast mine is very controlled,” Draco said pointedly as Hermione bit her bottom lip. Was it the dim light in the bedroom, or were Draco’s eyes darkening further at the thought? “Let me know if you want to give it a try.”
 
  She nodded as Theo glanced down at her list again. “It’s not on here because we’re the only triad in this game, so it would only apply to us, but since you’ve ticked maybe on anal, how do you feel about taking us both together?”
 
  “Together as in,” she stopped and stared at him in confusion as she figured out how that could work, “oh, yes, that's fine.” She nodded, then stopped as Draco’s eyes widened in surprise. “What?”
 
  “Together, Hermione, not one of us down there and one in your mouth,” Draco raised his eyebrows as he used a finger to point and laughed as her eyes bugged wide.
 
  “I meant one of us in your perfect little cunt and the other in your beautiful pert bottom, darling. At the same time.” Theo grinned as her mouth fell open. “Oh sweet Merlin, I knew it would be fun corrupting you, but still, your fucking gorgeous. Come here,” he moved across the bed to silence her with a kiss. 
 
  When he pulled back, she was breathing hard. “Let’s put that one down as a maybe too, shall we?!”  she asked.
 
  “That’s also fine by me,” Draco answered with a smile. 
 
  “So, do you want to try something tonight, then?” Theo grinned as she nodded slightly shakily. “Good girl. What safeword do you want to use?”
 
  “Can we stick with the colors, please?” 
 
  Theo nodded. “Of course. Now listen, because this is very important. I can’t judge how you feel about any of this until you either tell me or I hear your thoughts. Since your thoughts have to be very strong for me to do that, that's too late. I want you to use the yellow safeword if anything makes you the slightest bit uncomfortable. Alright?” he held her eyes until she nodded. “I won’t mind, and I won't be offended, but I will be upset if you find you don‘t like something, and you only tell me that afterwards, okay?”
 
  “Got it,” she said, shivering at the prospect of what lay ahead. 
 
  Theo nodded, then dropped a gentle kiss onto her lips. “Draco, get her stripped and show her the sub position, please, then strip yourself and kneel beside her. I’ll be back in a few minutes, and if I find you both kissing instead of kneeling when I get back, Hermione gets that pretty little arse of hers spanked.”
 
  With a swish, he left through the bed hangings, and Hermione turned to look at Draco for further instructions. “He’s giving you the choice, love. Do you want to be spanked?” He raised an eyebrow at her, “here, take your clothes off while you think.”
 
  “I thought the whole point of this kink was that he was in control?” she asked, slipping out of her jumper and t-shirt.
 
  Draco shook his head gently. “What people don't understand about this dynamic is that it's actually the sub who holds all the power. The dom’s job is to give you sexual pleasure. If you don't get off on something, he won't do it because there’s no point. Your reactions are what gives him his pleasure. When we’ve done a bit more of this, assuming you decide you like it, that is, you won’t get so much choice.”
 
  “Oh,” Hermione said, nodding as she stripped off the rest of her clothes. “I see.”
 
  “So, do you want a spanking tonight?” Draco’s eyes sparkled in the candlelight, and she could tell that he was just as excited by the prospect as she was herself. She bit her bottom lip again as she nodded, keeping her eyes downcast shyly on the bed. “Seriously, love, I think you’re a natural at this. Come here and kiss me then.” She shivered again and felt the air around them heat as Draco cast a wandless warming charm. 
 
  She shuffled nearer to Draco as he wrapped her up in his arms, kissing her with such scorching intensity that it took her breath away. “Do you like this dynamic too?” she asked as he pulled back to let her breathe. 
 
  He stroked her cheek gently as he looked at her. “I do. I like this a lot.” 
 
  Theo took his time coming back, and when he finally returned, Hermione was so thoroughly wrapped up in Draco that she barely noticed the bed hangings swishing open. 
 
  “Someone wants a spanking then?” Theo asked, watching them both with open amusement. 
 
  “Don’t look at him when you answer,” Draco whispered.
 
  Hermione nodded, keeping her eyes on the bedcovers as she said the first thing that popped into her head. “Yes, please, Sir.”
 
  Theo didn't move for a moment, but his sharp intake of breath told her he had heard her words perfectly well. “Right. Up you get then. Draco, put her across your lap. You can start. Give her ten firm smacks, and Hermione, you will say your current safeword color after each one.”
 
  Draco nodded, patting his lap with a smile. “Come here then,” he guided her into position so that her forehead was resting on a pillow on one side of his thighs, and her bottom was exposed on the other side. Draco rubbed his hand gently over her naked bum a couple of times, and she shivered with nervous anticipation as she felt his hand disappear. He brought it down with a resounding crack, and she jumped and cried out in surprise as he lifted his hand and her skin immediately started to sting. “Color?”
 
  “Green,” she gasped. The slap itself hadn’t exactly hurt. It had been more of a surprise, but what surprised her even more, was her body's reaction to the slight sting of pain. Draco’s next blow was a little harder than the first, and when he paused again, she felt a charge of heat to her skin and a rush of liquid arousal somewhere else. “Green,” she said again as Draco lifted his hand once more. 
 
  She writhed on Draco’s lap as he paused after each next smack to stroke a gentle hand over her inflamed skin. His finger dipped inside her wet heat, and she gasped. She heard Theo mutter an oath from beside them on the bed, and Draco nudged her legs further apart so that Theo could get a better view of what his finger was doing. “Five left, sweetheart. What’s your color?” Theo asked.
 
  “Green,” she gasped, feeling Draco’s thumb brush over her clit once, then stroke back up to caress her bottom again. She tensed as his hand disappeared. After all, she knew what was coming now, but all these subsequent blows did was increase the pleasure that she could now feel dripping out of her.
 
  “That was ten,” Draco said, pausing to rub his hand in soothing circles over her heated skin once again. “How are you doing, love?”
 
  It took her a while to find her voice. “I’m…. good!” she panted shakily. 
 
  “Color?” Theo asked again.
 
  “Green.”
 
  “Good girl. Come here.” His voice was low and commanding as he patted his own lap.  Hermione turned around, quivering with anticipation and feeling the beating of her pulse in her bottom with every move she made. “My my, that’s a gorgeous color.” He ran his nails ever so lightly over her reddened skin, and the increased sensitivity made her jump. “Pink looks good on you, beautiful. How does it feel?”
 
  “It feels…. Gods!... it feels amazing!” she bucked her hips as Theo’s fingertip dipped teasingly through her dripping folds. 
 
  “You're so wet, baby. Do you want to stop now, or do you want more?”
 
  “More please, Sir.” She couldn't help smiling as her words caused another hitch in his breathing. She was starting to see what Draco meant. It seemed she really did hold the power in this dynamic. She could stop this anytime she wanted. Her color words gave her complete control over whatever they both did to her. 
 
  She knew without needing to be told that this was Theo’s thing. He was so natural at it that she was able to relax and lose herself to whatever feelings he chose to evoke in her. She knew that his spanking wouldn’t be as gentle as Draco had been, if you could call what she had just experienced gentle, that is. Somehow, though, the intense physical contact had excited her more than she had thought possible, and she wanted to experience the rush she knew Theo would give her. 
 
  “How much more sweetheart? You see, pink is pretty, but I prefer red. How does that sound?” He chuckled as she clenched her thighs together then tried to rub herself against his thigh, desperate for some relief. “Color?”
 
  “Green.” An idea popped into her head, and she smiled secretly to herself. “Please, Theo, please, 
  
    Sir,
  
   will you spank me?” she giggled inwardly as he gasped then groaned loudly. 
 
  “Fuck, Hermione, you’re so good, baby. Ready? I’m going to give you another ten. I want your color after each one.”
 
  She nodded, bracing herself as he circled his palm over her now cooling flesh. “Gaaah!” she cried out at his first strike. It was a lot harder than any of Draco’s had been. The sting was much more intense, as was the rush of endorphins and then the pleasure that followed. “Green,” she gasped, and his hand came down again, harder still. 
 
  This felt different to what she had felt with Draco. This was, Merlin, this was indescribable. Her core clenched desperately on nothing and her mind switched off as she focused totally on the sensations racking through her body. Theo counted down his last three smacks, and when the last one rained down, her bottom felt like it was on fire. She collapsed over him, gasping for breath and desperate for release. “Color?” Theo asked, sounding wholly affected himself.
 
  “Green. Oh, Gods! Oh fuck, please, I need to come, please one of you-” her frantic words broke off as Theo plunged two fingers straight inside her. She cried out in shock as she ground herself back against him. He curled his fingers into her G spot and pinched her clit with his thumb, instantly sending her flying. 
 
  When she finally calmed, she found she was shivering so uncontrollably that her teeth were actually chattering. Draco pulled her into his arms and held her tenderly as she settled against him. “Shhh baby, you're okay. It’s just very intense the first time you experience anything like this. Stay with us.”
 
  Theo wrapped the duvet around them both, and Draco moved his position so that Theo could hold her as well. As Hermione relaxed, her face fell into a smile. Her bottom was throbbing like crazy, but each pulse was followed by a matching twinge somewhere completely unexpected. She turned to look up at Theo and blushed at the concern in his gaze. “Hey.”
 
  She smiled. “Hi.” 
 
  He held up a tube of ointment with a smile. “Aftercare, darling. This will soothe the sting and mean you can sit down comfortably tomorrow. Will you turn over, please?”
 
  She nodded as she carefully lay back down over Draco’s lap. She was still feeling a little dazed. “Oh my sweet Merlin, look at this Draco.”
 
  “Hmm,” Draco agreed, stroking her sensitised flesh. “Yeah, you do it a lot harder than I do.”
 
  “Was it too much?” Theo asked, sounding concerned as he started to rub the cream in gentle circles.
 
  Hermione sighed softly. As he had promised, the cream was indeed soothing. “Not at all. I’d have told you if it was.”
 
  “Good. You swore, by the way. I’ve never heard you swear before.”
 
  “Did I?” she asked, in surprise. “I don’t remember that. It must be another one of your bad influences.” She wriggled under Theo’s touch as he unintentionally reawakened her arousal with his gentle fingers.
 
  “I’m not taking the blame for everything,” he chuckled, “that one was definitely all you. Are you done tonight, baby girl, because you seem to be squirming on my lap again? Do you want to suck Draco off while you're down there?”
 
  Hermione smiled as she refocused her attention on Draco’s rock hard arousal. “I think I’ve got the energy for that,” she said, twisting her head around to give him a cheeky wink. “Theo?” he nodded as he continued to stroke her back, “while I do that, will you, you know, in my,” she blushed as he looked at her in confusion. She sighed, “Will you, I want you in here, while I go down on Draco. please?” she reached back to run her own finger through her slick, and Once again, Theo’s eyes nearly popped out of his head. 
 
  “Let me just get this quite straight,” he said slowly, “you’re being very shy about it, so I need to be sure. You want me to fuck you while you suck Draco off?” she whimpered as he grinned at her reaction. “Specifically, you want me to fuck your hot little cunt while you sink Draco’s rock hard cock deep into your mouth? You want us both to take you at the same time?”
 
  She could hardly speak, so she just nodded instead. “Do you want to set your own pace on Draco, or do you want me to set it for you both?”
 
  “Would you do it, please?”
 
  “Assuming I don’t just come in my pants right this second, then yes, beautiful, there’s nothing I’d like more. Hop up on the pillow Malfoy.” Draco scooted back into position, and Theo gently urged Hermione up and over him as Theo vanished his own clothes with a wandless spell. “Just a sec, you can’t safeword properly with your mouth full, Hermione, so either pull off or slap the bed if you're not happy. Got it?” She nodded, once again squirming with desire. 
 
  “Take Draco’s cock in your mouth then,” Theo whispered, and Hermione felt his fingers brush through her sodden curls. “I was going to ask if you were ready, but,” he broke off, chuckling as he lined himself up, “I can feel that you are.”
 
  Hermione leaned down and took Draco into her hand. She stroked his hard length a couple of times and ran her thumb over his glans, making him gasp. She lowered her head, sliding him as far into her mouth as she could comfortably take him. Theo waited until she had pulled back, and her body had naturally rocked into him, then he thrust gently halfway inside her. 
 
  She froze, whimpering with pleasure and unsure of how best to continue. “You okay, love?” Draco asked, gasping as Theo nudged her forwards again. She nodded as best she could and made a slight, indistinct noise in her throat as Theo sheathed himself the rest of the way inside her, then started to set a very gentle rhythm. 
 
  As she relaxed, she found that it worked. Theo nudged her forwards, so Draco slipped deeper into her mouth, then as she gently moved back, she was able to gulp a breath of air before Theo pushed her forwards again. It seemed to be another thing that worked best if she handed over control to the other two. She realized as Draco tapped her on the shoulder to warn her that he was close, she’d been right. She was more than happy with this particular dynamic. “I’m gonna,” Draco gasped, and Theo pressed her forwards more forcefully. Draco groaned, bunching the bed sheets tightly in his fingers as she sucked hard, hollowing her cheeks then swallowing. When he stilled, she pulled back to take a few hurried breaths, thoroughly pleased with her efforts. That was definitely getting easier.
 
  From Draco’s sated expression, she could tell that he was impressed with her efforts too. Theo merely grunted and tapped Draco’s legs to encourage him to move. Once the bed was clear, he pushed Hermione down so that her face was pressing into the pillow Draco gave her and then resumed his easy rhythm. 
 
  This was an angle they had never tried before, and its deep penetration felt incredible. She bucked back into Theo as his pace increased until she was meeting him frenzied thrust for frenzied thrust. She heard herself scream as she climaxed hard against him. In return, he groaned, pressing down on her back and twitching with his own release deep inside her. 

   

  When they finally found the energy to move again, none of them went far. Hermione’s eyes fluttered closed, and she nodded weakly when both boys checked in with her. She felt Theo kiss her on both cheeks as she settled down to sleep in Draco’s arms. “I love you, both of you,” she heard Draco whisper, and she tightened her fingers on his arm as Theo returned the words.
 
  “I love you both too,” she said, as the sound of Draco’s steady heartbeat lulled her off to sleep.

      

  
    Chapter Text
    
  Hermione slept fitfully on Sunday night. She drifted off to sleep moments after settling down in Draco’s arms but woke an hour later feeling agitated, although she wasn’t exactly sure why. She knew she should have slept well. The emotion from the previous day combined with the energetic evening should have been enough to guarantee her an uninterrupted night. She huffed in annoyance as she turned over yet again. Although she usually woke at least once every night, she hadn’t encountered insomnia like this since the war had ended. 
 
  By three in the morning, she was laying flat on her back between the two boys, feeling frustrated as she stared up at the ceiling. She changed position for what felt like the thousandth time, then felt Draco reach out to pull her against him. “What’s wrong?” he asked, turning to nuzzle his face into her hair.
 
  “I'm sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you both,” she whispered, “I just can’t sleep.”
 
  “You only woke me. You should know how Theo sleeps by now.” Draco adjusted his position then pressed a kiss to her temple. “You’ve been awake for ages, I didn’t say anything because I thought you’d fall back asleep, but you didn’t. What is it? Is your bottom sore, or did you not like what we did earlier?”
 
  She frowned in confusion, “wha- oh!!” she giggled quietly as she realized what was worrying him. “No, well, I mean, it is slightly sore, but I kind of like that. I liked what we did very much indeed.” She was glad that the dorms were so dark. It meant that Draco couldn’t see the intense blush that was coloring her cheeks as she spoke. 
 
  “What is it then, beautiful?”
 
  “I don’t know,” she admitted with a frustrated sigh. That wasn’t strictly true, but she didn’t want to fully share these particular worries until she understood them better herself. 
 
  “Hmmm.” Draco didn’t seem convinced by her answer either. Happily, he didn’t push the issue. Instead, he rolled over, lit his wand with a Lumos spell, opened the bedside 
  drawer, and started rummaging through potion vials. “Here, take this. It’s Draught of Dreamless Sleep. We’ll both be exhausted tomorrow if we don’t get some rest now.”
 
  Hermione nodded. “Thank you,” she uncorked the vial then drained the familiar tasting potion in one. She hadn’t needed to rely on this for a long time, and taking it now brought back memories of the many sleepless nights she had experienced while being on the run with Harry and Ron. 
 
  As soon as the potion hit her stomach, she began to feel drowsy. “Come here,” Draco nestled her in against his chest, wrapping his arms tightly around her almost exactly as Ron used to do on those long, cold nights. Straight away, her eyelids closed, and the steady sound of Draco’s heart lulled her into a deep, uninterrupted sleep. 
 
  When she woke the next day, she was intensely grateful for the few hours of rest the potion had bought her. The boys let her sleep late, Theo woke her at the last possible moment with some toast he’d brought up from the Great Hall, and she just about made it into class on time. Unfortunately, the unsettled feelings that had disturbed her night grew in strength as the day wore on, and by the time the school day ended she couldn’t sit with her agitation any longer. “Anyone in?” she called through the floo into the kitchen at Grimmauld Place. 
 
  “Hermione?” Remus’ voice answered as his heavily booted footsteps clunked down the stairs, “what are you doing here? is everything alright?” She hadn’t intended to hurtle bodily through the floo at the reassuring sound of his voice. She’d meant to check to see if it was a convenient time first, but the sight of his concerned face, untidy hair, and ink blotted fingers caused her fragile resolve to shatter. “Hey!” He crossed the kitchen in two long strides, catching her as she stumbled blindly out of the fireplace. “What’s wrong?”  
 
  “What’s going on Moons?” Sirius asked, stopping short at the sight of Remus holding a sobbing Hermione tightly in his arms. “What’s the matter, Kitten?” She felt Remus shrug his shoulders in reply and she buried her face further into his familiar smelling shoulder. When she eventually composed herself enough to pull back, Remus was looking at her in concern while Sirius looked angry. “Who’s upset you, Hermione?” 
 
  With one last sniffle, she dried her eyes on an old piece of tissue she’d happened to find in her pocket. “Nobody,” she admitted eventually. “Well okay, Theo and I had a bit of a misunderstanding yesterday, but I think I might have been the one who was at fault there. If I’m honest, I was being rather unreasonable.” She dropped her eyes, focusing hard on the flagstone floor. “Is this a good time for a visit?”
 
  “It’s always a good time for you to visit,” Remus said, smoothing her hair and motioning for Sirius to put the kettle on. 
 
  “Tea?” Sirius asked. She nodded as she sat down at the table with Remus. “Are we sure this situation doesn’t call for a stronger kind of drink? For medicinal purposes of course,”
 
  Hermione laughed despite her still runny nose. “Tea would be perfect, thank you.”
 
  “Fine,” Sirius wrinkled his nose as he dumped teabags into mugs. “What happened then?” he turned, leaning back against the kitchen counter to survey her through narrowed eyes as he waited for the kettle to boil, “Why were you, Hermione Granger, the most level headed witch we know, being so unreasonable?”
 
  “I think I may have overreacted to something,” she admitted, frowning as she started to recount the story of what had happened in the library the previous day. As she talked, Sirius set her tea in front of her and she wrapped her hands around the warm, comforting mug. The words written on it made her giggle despite her rather emotional mood. “World’s Sexiest Werewolf? Really?” Remus’ charming wink just made her laugh harder and her spirit lightened considerably as she resumed her explanation. 
 
  Both Remus and Sirius watched with guarded expressions until she had finally talked herself out. “See, you both think I overreacted too. Don’t you?” she challenged after a long beat of silence. 
 
  “No, actually, I don’t,” Sirius said as the two men exchanged a significant look. Sirius gestured to Remus who turned to Hermione. He ran his fingers through the back of his hair, while he fixed her with an appraising look. 
 
  “Tell me, 
  
    why does
  
   Theo, Tracy, and Daphne’s friendship bother you so much?” Hermione said nothing, she just stared at him blankly as she tried to articulate her thoughts. “Let’s be honest here, you're not a jealous person,” Remus continued. “You know men and women can be friends. Your best friends are male. So why does 
  
    this 
  
  particular friendship upset you so much?
  
    ”
  
 
  Hermione sipped her tea to buy herself more time to answer truthfully. She didn't like to admit the real reason she was so suspicious, but she knew that her fears would continue to bother her until she voiced them. “Because I don’t trust them. I don’t like them and I think they’re up to something,” she finally admitted all in a rush. “After this happened yesterday, we talked, the three of us, and Theo told me that he’s fallen in love with me, and that he’s loved Draco for years. Draco said pretty much the same thing.” 
 
  She looked up to check Sirius and Remus’ expressions at that revelation, but although Remus was smiling broadly, Sirius was still watching her passively. “The thing is, I believe them both. I don’t think either of them would look at anyone else in that way, but I still don’t like those three girls. I think they want to split us up but I don’t know why.” 
 
  “Firstly, the problem with the three girls aside, that’s brilliant news, Kitten. I like Theo a lot. Draco too for that matter. What did you say in return?” Sirius’ face relaxed into an honest grin as she beamed at him across the table.
 
  “That I felt the same,” she admitted, feeling delighted that both men seemed to be so genuinely pleased for her.
 
  “So,” Sirius’ eyes sharpened as he regarded her seriously once more. “Do you think these girls are behind the notes as well?”
 
  Hermione stared down at her hands. She wanted to say no, but she couldn’t truly squash the suspicion that they might be. There was something about Tracy in particular that was putting her on edge, and every time she caught sight of Astoria lately, the younger girl seemed to be rather upset. “I don't know,” she said eventually. “Please, 
  
    please 
  
  don’t mention this to anyone else, especially not Theo or Draco. I might be entirely wrong about it all,” she admitted, “but I don’t think I am. If they are the ones behind the notes, I intend to do my very best to prove it and to expose them.”
 
  Sirius nodded. “You do that, Kitten. But be careful, don’t let them know you're on to them or they’ll clam up and you won’t get anywhere. Just watch them carefully without it being obvious what you’re doing. Also, while we’re talking about watching people carefully, will you tell me why you're perching so delicately on the edge of that rather comfortable chair please? 
 
  Hermione’s eyes widened as her cheeks flamed bright red. She sipped more of her tea then rather pointlessly flicked her hair forwards to cover her face. “No,” she gasped, 
  hastily adjusting her position with a badly timed wince, “I very definitely can’t tell you that!”
 
  Sirius’ eyes widened and his lips curved up into a grin, “I see. Wait a minute, where are we Moons? 1st of December. Which themed week would that be in the Cupid game?”
 
  Remus counted on his fingers then laughed. “Week five is just beginning, I do believe.”
 
  Sirius grinned even more broadly. “Hmm. Didn’t we design week five to be fetish week, Remus?”
 
  “Well yes, Sirius, I believe we might have done that.” Hermione looked at their mischievous faces and was powerless to stop a giggle escaping her lips. Sirius crossed to the first aid cupboard then pulled out a small unopened tube of ointment. He held it between his finger and thumb as he squinted at Hermione. “Just tell me two things, are you happy with what you’re all doing, and is your bottom sore for the reason I think it is?”
 
  “There’s no need to be embarrassed Hermione, we’re perfectly aware of the potential dynamics in your relationship right now. Aware and rather familiar with them ourselves, should you ever want to talk about that aspect of things too?” Remus offered.
 
  Hermione covered her face with her hands, peeping through her fingers as she nodded. “Okay. Thank you. Yes, I’m very happy with the dynamic, this was all completely consensual, but that’s all I want to say about it at the moment.”
 
  “This will sort you out then.” Sirius grinned broadly as he passed her the tube. She took it, turning it over to read the label carefully, “it works a treat, believe me.” 
 
  “Madam Carlotta’s Moste Potente Soothing Potion,” she read with a frown, “Do I even want to ask why you two would have a tube of this on hand? And how do you… oh!”
 
  Hermione stared at Sirius as Remus’ previous words finally registered in her surprised brain. Sirius didn’t look the slightest bit embarrassed at her scrutiny, he just grinned cheekily back at her, “I’ll give you a full rundown if you like-”
 
  Sensing that it was a delicate subject, Remus held up a hand to cut him off, “lets just say the cream has its uses Hermione. Get one of them to rub it into your sore... 
  
    areas, 
  
  and you’ll be as right as rain.” 
 
  Sirius shook his hair back giving what appeared to be a highly affected shiver as he turned to Remus, “in the meantime, have we got another tube, Re? Only I’m thinking you could…” Sirius reached out to catch Remus’ hand and Hermione’s teeth sank gently into her bottom lip as she watched Remus’ eyes flash amber in reply. 
 
  “There’s plenty more cream in the cupboard,” Remus replied in a voice that was quite different from his usual one. 
 
  Hermione froze. Remus’ new, low tone was identical to the one Theo liked to use in the bedroom. “Right, umm…. I’ll just go then. Thank you, for the tea. And for the advice.” She stood up, feeling thoroughly surprised as she made her way to the floo. She’d never noticed the way Sirius deferred to Remus before, but his eyes had dropped notably as he’d made his suggestion and Remus’ tone of voice had convinced her that the two men shared a similar dynamic to the one she was just discovering with Draco and Theo. She picked up the pot of glittering grey powder but still neither Sirius nor Remus noticed that she had moved. “Bye then!” she giggled, and finally the roar of the flames broke through their heated moment. 
 
  “Wha-?” Sirius looked up as if surprised to find her there, “Oh!” he said absently, “I was going to ask if you wanted to stay for dinner?!”
 
  Hermione’s giggle turned into a laugh. “No thanks. I think dinner is the last thing on either of your minds right now!”
 
  Sirius just winked as she turned away. The last thing Hermione was aware of as she stepped into the emerald green flames was the low growl that Remus emitted as he tugged Sirius forwards into his embrace.

  
  

  
  
Hermione staggered as the other end of the floo discharged her into the eighth year common room. She blinked in further surprise at the sight of Theo surrounded by open school books studying at the same table as Blaise, Greg, and Ron. “Hey!” his blue eyes brightened considerably as he saw her, “come here beautiful, a few kisses from you might take the edge of this ridiculous essay that I seem to find myself writing.”  
  “Yes,” she smiled as she approached their table, “It’s quite unusual to see you doing homework.” She leaned down, kissing him rather more passionately than she had intended, still feeling rather affected by what she had just witnessed. 
 
  She released a rather surprised looking Theo to find Blaise smirking up at her. “Must have been a good night if you’re kissing him like that, and needing 
  
    that 
  
  particular cream.”
 
  Theo’s eyes slid down her arm to the small tube in her hand. “You said you didn’t want any healing,” he said with a frown. “Besides, I’ve got that in my bedside drawer. Where did you get that tube from?”
 
  “Ummm, Grimmauld Place,” Hermione admitted with yet another blush. “But I didn’t go there for that reason, I popped in because I needed to see Remus about something, and while I was having a cup of tea Sirius pointed out that I was perching.”
 
  Theo threw his head back and laughed as Blaise chuckled. “Oh baby, you're such a delight. Want me to put some on for you now?”
 
  “No. After dinner will be fine, finish your homework first.” She settled down semi comfortably at the table next to Theo and peered at the work he was doing. Her eyes widened as she read the first few lines of his potions report then turned to stare at him in surprise. “Seriously, why don’t you,” she broke off as she read further, “there are things in here that I don’t know and I thought I’d done every bit of research possible on this subject. Draco’s right about how intelligent you are. You’d be at the top of the class if you only put in more effort!”
 
  Theo just gave her a benign smile. “Maybe, maybe not. I told you, I put effort into the subjects that interest me. I can do homework if I want to, It’s just getting myself sufficiently motivated to do it that’s tricky. I tend to get distracted rather easily.” His gaze lingered on Hermione’s breasts as he spoke and she rolled her eyes. “Talking of distractions, Blaise are you able to touch this up for me?” Theo pushed his sleeve up and pressed the head of his snake tattoo as Blaise looked over to study it with interest. The tail of the snake flicked across his arm as usual, but the movement somehow lacked it’s usual vigor. It stopped short halfway through, then flopped weakly back into place.
 
  Blaise turned to examine the tattoo more closely. He ran his wand all over it, pressed the snake’s head himself then frowned as it stopped short after the same half hearted move. “Yes,” he nodded. “The movement spell is wearing off that’s all. It needs replacing once a year or so. Are you happy for me to do it? Only I thought you didn’t trust me doing these on my own quite yet?”
 
  “I changed my mind,” Theo admitted as Hermione finished reading his report. Forgetting that she wasn’t studying with Ron or Harry she tapped the parchment with her wand and the few spelling and grammar errors corrected themselves. “Thanks love, you're a gem. You couldn’t just finish off the last couple of paragraphs for me could you? It’s literally almost done,” he asked, brushing his leg against hers under the table.
 
  “No, it’s not,” she frowned. “You’ve not started the last question. Look,” she picked up a quill and started scribbling notes onto his note sheet, but he moved that away and pushed the unfinished essay under her hand instead. 
 
  “Duplicates,” he whispered quietly. Hermione frowned as her handwriting changed to match his, but Theo carefully ignored her reaction. He simply pressed a kiss to her upper arm then turned back to continue his discussion with Blaise. 
 
  “Hold still then,” Blaise said after a few minutes. He held his wand directly over the snake then paused, “remember how much this hurts.”
 
  Theo nodded, then jumped out of his chair with a sudden shout as Blaise pinned his arm firmly down. “Don’t move halfway through for fucks sake!” he exclaimed, still holding onto Theo until the spell was complete. 
 
  “Holy... fucking mother of... bloody 
  
    hell,
  
   Blaise!” Theo cursed as Ron and Greg looked up sharply. 
 
  “Eloquent, mate, very eloquent,” Blaise muttered as Theo turned wide eyes back to his arm. Hermione raised her eyebrows too, the snake was now a much deeper, inkier black, and this time when Blaise pressed his thumb to the serpent’s head, its tail flicked out as jauntily as she’d ever seen. “I did remind you that that spell hurts, happily your lovely girlfriend’s got some cream that will soothe the sting.” Blaise’s chocolate brown eyes were twinkling with amusement as he indicated the tube that was now lying face down on the table.
 
  “Yes, well, I don’t remember it hurting that much in Italy,” Theo huffed.
 
  “You were pissed when we did it in Italy,” Blaise pointed out.
 
  “As I will be the next time you do that! Thanks though, and thank you too, love,” Hermione rolled her eyes as she put the finishing touches to his essay.
 
  “I thoroughly dispute what you said last night about you not being a good Slytherin,” she complained, trying her best to sound disgruntled. “I just finished your report off for you before I even properly realised what I was doing. Your ability to get other people to do your work is impressive.”
 
  Theo merely grinned, “It was necessary help, love. I’m in a lot of pain now, I couldn’t possibly have finished it without your input.”
 
  “He’s also rather dramatic,” Hermione laughed at Blaise’s conspiratorial wink, “but you’ve probably worked that out by now. That spell only hurts for a few moments. Don’t believe anything he tells you otherwise.” She nodded, handed the finished essay back to Theo then looked up to find herself lost in his kiss once again.
 
  “Dorms,” he whispered when she pulled back, conscious of Blaise’s raised brow and Ron’s open stare, “now. Take your knickers and tights off, leave everything else as it is then wait for me on Draco’s bed.”
 
  Hermione nodded as an inferno of renewed arousal flared through her body. “Dinner’s in fifteen minutes,” she whispered weakly. Worrying had caused her to eat precious little of her lunch and as such she was now famished.
 
  Theo just grinned. “Then you’d best let me get you off quickly, hadn’t you?” he asked. “It would be terribly rude of me not to thank you for finishing my homework after all.”

  
  
  
  “I’m just checking,” Hermione looked up as Theo’s voice sounded in her ear even though he was nowhere to be seen, “that you're comfortable doing this without Draco being here.” She looked around feeling totally baffled, wondering how he was speaking to her so intimately when he wasn’t even in the room. 
 
  “As long as he doesn’t mind, I’m more than happy to be alone with you,” she replied, wondering if he could hear her just as clearly in return.
 
  “Good.” She jumped, feeling his lips tickle her ear even as he swished the bed hangings open and walked into Draco’s bed space with a cocky grin. “Did that work?” he asked, staring at her dumbfounded face. She nodded as his smile broadened. “So I 
  
    can 
  
  do it then. Nice.”
 
  Hermione brushed a hand over her ear feeling thoroughly confused. “What 
  
    was
  
   that?!”
 
  Theo chuckled, “one particular branch of sex magic. Well, it’s general magic actually, but it tends to be used for sexual purposes. I won’t try it again without telling you first unless you like it, that is. I didn’t actually think I could do it. Draco can do it to a level that blows your mind, but as I said before, I’m not so controlled.” He paused, smiling as he stroked a hand under her skirt and across her naked core. “You’re comfortable being alone with me then?” he continued, “Draco doesn’t mind, I already checked. For the record, I’m comfortable with you and him being together when you want to be too. Do you mind him and me taking the occasional moment together ourselves?”
 
  “Not at all,” Hermione’s breath quivered as she flushed yet again, “And yes, you can do the mind magic thing again. It’s fine. I trust you. In fact, can I ask a favor please?”
 
  “Of course.” 
 
  Her blush deepened as she stared shyly at the bed, “I’d really like to watch you and Draco together. Like properly together.”
 
  Theo’s eyes darkened as he exhaled loudly. “You can watch us shag anytime you like, darling. I never let an opportunity for sex with either of you pass me by. I’ll see what we can do on that score later. Now though, as you’ve just pointed out, time is short. Lay back and bunch your skirt up, beautiful.” 
  Hermione scooted backwards on the bed, lifting her skirt up around her waist as she moved. “Tongue, fingers or cock, baby girl?”
 
  Her answering smile was almost as wicked as his own. “I thought you were supposed to be in charge this week?”
 
  Theo paused. “You really like that then?” he asked, “honestly? Because you don’t have to be into it just because I am.”
 
  “But I really do like it,” she admitted. “I’ve been thinking about things a lot today, and that’s part of it you see? I never stop thinking. I overthink everything. I worry to a ridiculous extent and sometimes that all gets to be too much.” She paused, reaching out to stroke the back of his hand. “There’s been a few times lately where you’ve taken charge and my brain has totally switched off. All I could do was experience what was happening. It was so refreshing, so liberating not have to think or be in control for a change. Honestly I will tell you if it goes too far, or if I want a break from it but yes, please, will you relax about this for me?”
 
  Theo closed his eyes and when he opened them his pupils were completely blown. “Yes,” he said simply. “Lie down. Let me turn your brain off then.” He spoke commandingly, the same way Remus had earlier, and the low, dark edge to his voice set all of Hermione’s nerves jangling yet again. Her legs began to quiver in anticipation as he stared at her hungrily. 
 
  He kissed her forcefully while using his hands to pull her thighs apart. Then he dropped his head to lick a firm stripe straight through her already soaked folds. She gasped, his accuracy was perfect. His tongue lingered on her clit making her tremble more forcefully and she cried out as he sucked the swollen nub into his mouth then released it with a tiny pop. 
 
  “We have to be quick,” he said, as he plunged two fingers inside her, instantly finding and pressing firmly on her g spot, “so you need to come when I tell you too. I can feel you’re close. You’ve made me so hard, baby, hard and throbbing just for you.” She whimpered softly, bucking against his fingers as he increased the pressure then withdrew his hand leaving her momentarily bereft.
 
  He stilled her thigh as she squirmed. “Keep still,” he ordered, smiling as she instantly obeyed. “I’m going to fuck you hard and fast. You’ll get what you want. You’ll get my cock buried to the hilt inside your beautiful, dripping cunt, but I need to undress first.” Hermione tightened her fingers on the bedding, panting softly as he stood back, licked her essence from his fingers, then undid his trousers just as the bell sounded for dinner. 
 
  Hermione’s whole body was trembling as his boxers fell to the floor. His cock sprang up, already standing at full attention. Theo took it in his hand, licked his lips and stroked himself gently a couple of times to tease her. “If we had more time I’d get you to suck this first, but we can do that later. Shuffle forwards.” 
  Theo gently tugged her right up to the edge of the bed. Then, still standing, he took himself in hand again and brushed the tip of his glans against her core once. She whimpered at his teasing then cried out as he pushed smoothly inside her. He paused, waiting for her to adjust comfortably to his size. “Alright?” he asked. She nodded, fidgeting slightly on her sore bottom then wrapping her legs around his hips.
 
  This was another new position for her, but despite that, Theo took her exactly as he’d promised, hard, and fast. He leaned forwards to kiss her, swallowing her wanton moans as her climax built rapidly. She was on the brink of release when she heard his voice in her ear, even though he was still kissing her deeply and couldn’t possibly speak. “Come, Hermione. Come for me now.”
 
  She tensed, his show of magical power was the catalyst that tipped her violently over the edge and into sweet oblivion. It was as intense a climax as she had ever felt, but Theo just kissed her all the way through it, thrusting gently as her walls clenched deliciously around him over and over again. 
 
  “Don’t stop,” his voice sounded breathless this time, and she felt him plunge impossibly deep inside her as he reached his own release with a tortured groan. 
 
  All too soon, he pulled gently out of her and kissed her lightly on her swollen lips then cast a wandless scourgify over them both. “You like the power shows as well don’t you?” he asked, passing her underwear back with a grin and zipping up his trousers as if nothing at all unusual had happened. 
 
  Hermione nodded, still gathering her scattered wits. “I should have guessed that someone as intelligent as you would be turned on by mind magic. Wait till you see what Draco can do in that area. I think you might decide to give the sex magic a try after all. Anyway,” he held out a hand as she stood up unsteadily, “come on, beautiful, let’s go down to dinner.”

  
    Chapter Text
    
  A loud, persistent tapping woke Hermione early on Thursday morning. She blinked away the last vestiges of sleep then frowned in confusion as Blaise spoke directly outside their bed hangings. “Knock knock?”
 
  “Come in,” she replied, running her fingers through her sure to be unruly hair.
 
  “Sorry to disturb you,” Blaise said, grinning at Theo, who was still snoring loudly, “it’s just that you have a rather urgent owl.” He opened the curtain further to let a bedraggled tawny owl fly into their bed space, then closed them snugly again. Frowning in confusion, Hermione untied the letter from the disgruntled bird’s leg. She unfolded the parchment, saw Hagrid’s untidy handwriting, and squinted in the dim light to read.
 
  
    “Dear Hermione. 
  

  
    The weather’s going to be a fright today. Harry says yer boyfriend’s got a knack with magical creatures, and I could use the help. You are excused from lessons today. Come as soon as you can.
  

  
    Hagrid.”
  

  
  

  Hermione gasped as Draco sat up to peer sleepily at the letter. “What’s going on?” he asked with a yawn, “it’s still dark. Why have we got soaking wet owls in the bed?”
 
  Hermione sighed, feeling somewhat guilty. She had been planning to take Theo to visit Hagrid a while ago, but after all that had happened recently, she hadn’t got around to it yet. She hadn’t seen Hagrid properly for weeks. She passed the note to Draco wordlessly, then stepped out of bed, shivered in the cold morning air, and then made her way over to the window. Blaise was already there watching the snow that was falling, blanketing the castle in a thick shroud of white. 
 
  Her eyes widened as she took in the magnitude of the snowstorm. The wind was howling across the grounds, rattling the windows in their frames and making thousands of icy snowflakes fly horizontally through the air like tiny daggers. It looked awful. She picked up an abandoned pen from the window ledge, wrote a reply to Hagrid, opened the window then launched the reluctant owl back out into the storm. Blaise helped her slam the window shut against the freezing wind, and they both stood still, shivering for a moment. “Theo! Draco! Ginny! Wake up!” she called urgently. “Hagrid needs our help.”

  
  
  
  It was even worse outside than it had looked from the dormitory window. This was terrible weather on a scale that Hermione had rarely ever experienced, even in the Scottish Highlands. The bitter air temperature was made all the colder by the biting north easterly wind and the sleet swirling in vicious circles all around them. Hermione stood with her teeth chattering beside Theo, Draco, Harry, Pansy, Blaise, Ginny, Ron, and Millie as Hagrid shivered in his thick moleskin overcoat and explained the tasks he needed them to do. 
 
  Once he had dispatched Millie and Ron to levitate several bales of hay deep into the forest for the unicorns, Hagrid turned to Hermione, Theo, and Draco. “You three can take these shelters over to Bowtruckle Island.” He fixed his beetle black eyes on Theo and gave him a significant nod. “You know what to do, we’ve covered this in class. You’ve always been good in my lessons. There’s something about you, I don’t know what it is, but the creatures feel it too. They sense you're a good-un.” Hagrid nodded again and passed over two large rucksacks. “Watch the weather. If you get stuck over there, dig in and shelter, we’ll rescue you later.” 
 
  “Will do.” Theo said, looking inordinately pleased with Hagrid’s assessment of his character. He watched the others stomp away in the snow and Hermione smiled as he turned back to her with what was, for Theo, a rather shy grin. 
 
  “I told you Hagrid doesn’t hate you,” she said softly. 
 
  “No one could bloody well hate you anyway,” Draco agreed, sounding proud. “And if either of you want proof of my feelings for you, just know that I wouldn’t be out in this storm for anybody else.” He kicked moodily at the snow and rolled his eyes as he jammed his hands into the pockets of his quidditch cloak.
 
  “Are you not in an outdoorsy mood, Malfoy?” Theo chuckled, “I can’t think of why you wouldn’t fancy a day outside in this!”
 
  “It won’t be too bad once we get moving, I’m sure,” Hermione said in what she hoped was a conciliatory tone. She reached down and picked up one of the giant rucksacks. “Shall we get started?”
 
  “Yep. Are we crossing the lake by brooms or boat?” Theo asked, stamping his feet to keep warm.
 
  “Can’t Hagrid just drop the bloody wards so we can apparate over there? I’d have thought a teacher could do that.” 
 
  “Apparently not. Brooms or boat, Blondie?” Theo challenged, ignoring Draco’s grumbling. 
 
  “Brooms. I don’t fancy sailing in this wind. Accio Firebolt!” he called, pointing his wand vaguely towards the castle. Theo did the same, then, when nothing happened they both repeated the spell more forcefully. Hermione frowned, wondering if the brooms could navigate the sure to be closed dormitory windows, then flinched at the sound of smashing glass. “Bollocks!” Draco muttered. “Sodding windows. Bloody weather. Reparo.”
 
  “Have you quite finished moaning now?” Theo grinned, his amusement clearly irritating Draco still further. “Come on darling,” he said, picking up the other rucksack then swinging his leg over his hovering broom, “you look about as happy to be doing this as 
  Pansy did. You know I’ll make it up to you.” He staggered as a particularly strong gust of wind caught him. “Can you take Hermione over? You’ll fly better in this than me.”
 
  At Draco’s nod, Hermione took a deep breath and settled herself, and her bags on the front of his Firebolt. She wrapped the quidditch cloak she had borrowed from Seamus around herself more tightly, then leaned back against Draco’s chest as he kicked up into the stormy sky. 
 
  Instantly she remembered why flying had made her so nervous in the past. Draco tightened his arms protectively around her, and for once, he didn’t fly recklessly. “I’ve got you,” he whispered, and she nodded, grateful that it was a short flight. She looked around as they flew closer to Theo. It was impossible to see more than a few feet in any direction, but the inky surface of Black Lake was unnervingly clear below them. She closed her eyes as a particularly hard wind gust buffeted them, and was intensely grateful when Draco nosed the broom down safely on Bowtruckle Island. 
 
  She dismounted hastily, breathing hard as she waited for her stomach to settle. She had never been here before. Only the students who were studying Care of Magical Creatures to NEWT level ever visited this Island, since the Bowtruckles were so easy to upset. “Let’s leave the brooms here,” Theo said, dismounting. “We need to get to the middle of the Island, to the circle of Wigginwood trees. That’s where the Bowtruckles live. Come on, it’s this way.”
 
  Incredibly, the blizzard seemed to be strengthening as they walked. It was getting harder to see where they were going and the wind was increasing to the point that Hermione was worried it would blow the weaker looking trees down. She stopped, reaching out for the boys as they became engulfed in what was now a complete white out. “Does anything unfriendly live on this Island?” she asked, feeling relieved when Theo shook his head. 
 
  “Nope,” he confirmed. “It's reserved for the Bowtruckles. They won't live in the Forbidden Forest itself because of the predators, so this island habitat was made especially for them. Nothing here will hurt us, except for this damn weather.”
 
  Hermione watched her wellington booted feet sink into the rapidly deepening snow. The quidditch cloaks really were remarkable. The wind and rain charms on them repelled almost everything that the storm was throwing at them, and despite the fact that the temperature was well below zero, she still felt relatively warm. “I’m not sure I like you wearing another man’s name on your back,” Draco frowned, watching her pull Seamus's scarlet robe around her more snugly. 
 
  “I’d prefer to be wearing yours,” she agreed, placating him with a kiss as Theo cast a compass charm on his wand then walked forwards into the blizzard, “or Theo's, but neither of you had a spare. Anyway this one’s more my color.” 
 
  “Hmm,” Draco took her hand as they followed Theo into the woods. Once they had gotten a little ways inside, the worst of the storm died away, blocked by the outer ring of enormous oaks. Looking around from their new sheltered perspective, Hermione was impressed. She hadn’t realised the island was so big. 
 
  They walked for a good five minutes, Theo checking their direction regularly with his wand. “We come over here in class a couple of times a month,” he said, frowning, “so I should know the way, but it’s impossible to gauge where we are in this. We’re looking for a ring of different looking trees growing within the forest. They're called Wigginwood trees. Their bark is a very dark brown and they look a bit more pointy than the oaks.” 
 
  “Pointy?” Draco raised a skeptical eyebrow, “is that a technical term?” 
 
  Theo just laughed and carried on walking. The Wigginwoods took a while to find and it was actually Draco who picked them out. Utilising his seekers eyesight, he pointed up at the discreet line of dark brown trees woven through the rest of the forest. “Is this it? There’s some pointy looking trees here.”
 
  Theo shielded his eyes from the swirling snow and grinned. “Yes! See, if I’d described them as single rooted phylogenetic trees you’d never have spotted them, would you?” He dropped the rucksack from his back then knelt down to unpack the contents, laughing when Draco called him a smartass. He caught Draco’s face between his gloved hands as he stood up, dropped a kiss to his lips, then passed him what looked like several tiny wooden boxes, each the size of a matchbox. “Enlarge these please, they’re Bowtruckle shelters. We need to fix one to each Wigginwood tree. Hermione, here you go. Don’t say I never give you presents!”
 
  Hermione couldn’t stop herself recoiling from the bag Theo handed her. “What on earth- Oh! Woodlice!”
 
  She rolled her eyes at his chuckle. “Can you cast a long lasting warmth charm over each shelter, then put a bowl of woodlice inside please?”
 
  She nodded, watching Draco enlarge the first box. At full size it was surprisingly big, big enough to shelter at least a dozen Bowtruckles, and the inside was comfortably padded with warm woollen blankets. “Don't the Bowtruckles just hunker down in the trees if they haven’t got these?” she asked, wondering if all this was strictly necessary.
 
  “To a certain extent they do,” Theo admitted, “but a lot of them would die if we didn’t help them through the winters. They live on the Hogwarts grounds because the area is so magical, but they're not really native this far north.” 
  Hermione nodded, filling a bowl with dead woodlice. She placed it carefully into the box that Draco and Theo had attached to the first Wigginwood tree, cast a robust warming charm over it and smoothed the blankets with her hand. “Perfect,” Theo said, standing back to admire their handiwork.
 
  They carried on, moving around the circle until they were back where they had started. “Can we look to see if they’ve moved in yet?” Hermione asked.
 
  Theo lifted the lid of the first box and she blinked in surprise. It was already full of a family of stick-like bowtruckles. Two adults and about seven of their children were all settled 
  inside. There was even a baby Bowtruckle, held tightly in its mother’s knobbly arms. The Bowtruckes all jumped back in alarm as Hermione moved closer, one raised it’s fist and she backed hastily out of range just in case they were in the mood to be aggressive. 
 
  “Offer them a fresh woodlouse with your hand held still,” Theo instructed, watching her with a smile.
 
  Cautiously Hermione did as he said. Sure enough one of the midsized Bowtruckles took the dead insect from her hand after only a moment's hesitation. “Hi little guy,” she whispered, delighted that the creature trusted her enough to prod experimentally at her fingers. Hermione giggled as more Bowtruckles came forward, emboldened by the first one’s bravery, and soon they were climbing all over her hand, taking woodlice from her fingers at a rate that she struggled to keep up with. “You’ve got a bowl full there!” she laughed, but the newly confident Bowtruckles just ignored it completely.
 
  “See, they’re quite friendly if you let them come to you,” Theo said when Hermione finally withdrew her hand. “Right, we’re all done here. We’ll need to come back tomorrow if this weather keeps up because they won’t leave the boxes to find their own food in this.”
 
  “I don’t blame them,” Draco said, peering curiously into the box Hermione had just vacated. “I wouldn’t either. Come on then, let's go.”
 
  “Oh.” Theo said ten minutes later as they stood on the edge of the forest staring out in dismay, “shit.” The already terrible snow storm had worsened yet again while they had been working. The blizzard was now so thick that they could barely see each other’s faces. 
 
  “This isn’t safe to fly in,” Draco stated, and Theo agreed.
 
  Hermione nodded, resigning herself to being outside for a while longer. “It’s a good thing I brought food and hot drinks then, isn't it?” she grinned as Draco smiled and Theo pretended to faint with gratitude. 
 
  “You, Hermione, are an amazing woman,” Theo announced, kissing her forcefully. “There are two things in this world that I can’t live without, food and sleep, and you’ve just brought me food, therefore I’m a happy man!”
 
  “What about us?!” Draco asked in mock indignation, retreating back into the shelter of the woods and using his wand to sweep snow away from a patch of sheltered earth, “I thought you couldn’t live without us?!”
 
  “Food, sleep, and you two then,” Theo conceded, taking the sandwich Hermione offered. “Oh and sex. How, love? How in the name of hells hinkypunks did you manage this wonderful picnic at such short notice?”
 
  Hermione smiled under his glowing praise. “I just asked Keacher and Dobby to get us some food. They’re Harry’s elves,” she clarified, noting the pained look that crossed Draco’s face at the mention of Dobby. 
 
  “How, umm, how is Dobby these days?” he asked awkwardly.

   

  Hermione froze. How was it possible that she had forgotten Dobby had used to be owned by the Malfoy’s and was therefore a touchy subject?

   

  “He’s very happy,” she said as reassuringly as she could. 

   

  Draco nodded. “Good. I never meant to, I didn’t know any better, alright?” he said, looking pained as Hermione cast a wind barrier around them, “I didn’t know it was wrong to treat the elves badly, it was just how I was raised. I never did anything too terrible to him myself, If I’m honest. I had a bit of a soft spot for him, especially when I was little. He was kinder to me than some of the people in my family were.”

   

  “Dobby is very kind. He saved my life, as you know,” Hermione admitted, “although he nearly died in the process. It was only Bill and Fleur Weasley’s knowledge of wound healing spells that saved him.” She abandoned the picnic bag and reached out to take Draco’s gloved hand in her own. “I’ve seen how you’ve changed,” she grinned as she gestured around with her other hand. “I think this is proof of how well you treat magical creatures these days, don’t you?””

   

  Draco nodded as Theo pushed a foil wrapped sandwich into his hand. “I suppose so. I’ve just spent the entire bloody morning rescuing Bowtruckles from a blizzard, so yeah. I guess I’ve changed my opinions towards magical beings quite a lot.”

   

  “Good,” Hermione said as Theo gave them each a plastic mug to hold then started to pour steaming tomato soup out of the Thermos, “I'm very glad to hear that.”
    
  It was snug and warm in their makeshift shelter. Hermione pulled the duvet she had transfigured from the picnic bag a little higher around them and nestled comfortably against both boys. The swirling blizzard was mesmerising to watch, and she couldn’t remember feeling this peaceful in a long time. Finally, as the wind and the snow started to die down, she cast a tempus charm with her wand. “One o clock,” she confirmed. “They’ll be wondering where we are.”

   

  “They’ll know what we’ve done. Send your Patronus over the lake with a message if you think they’ll be worried,” Draco replied.

   

  Hermione nodded but didn’t actually move. “We could just about make afternoon lessons if we go now, too.” Despite her words, she still made no attempt to leave their snowy cocoon.

   

   “We could,” Draco agreed, “but I think even you know we’re not going to. We were given the whole day off. Remember?”
 
  “Bugger going to lessons,” Theo grinned, stuck the end of his finished cigarette into the snow so that it went out with a fizz, then vanished it with his wand, “I’m heading straight for the prefect’s bathroom. I’ll claim it’s to ward off pneumonia if anyone complains, Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t want us getting sick now, would she?”

   

  “To be fair, I’m with Theo on this, love,” Draco admitted. I don’t usually advocate skipping school, but I think we could do with warming up after being out here for so long.”

  
    
    
  
  
  So that was how, later that afternoon, Hermione found herself floating lazily in the enormous prefect’s bath with a group of friends, rather than being in class where she should have been for the first time in her entire life. 

   

  “Stop it,” Ron teased, making her jump as he dove underneath her in the blissfully warm water, then surfaced again beside her. 

   

  “Stop what?” she blinked as the water he shook out of his hair flicked into her eyes.

   

  “Fretting about missing class. Hagrid gave us the day off and Pansy and Blaise are prefects. We’re not breaking any rules by being in here.”

   

  “I know, but we’re so close to the end of term! The teachers are giving out our assignments this week-” she broke off with a deep sigh, “Blaise isn’t here though. He and Ginny snuck off, except you probably didn’t need to know that and, oh!” she rubbed her hands over her face, “I need to stop worrying so much, don’t I?”

   

  “Yep,” Ron’s grin faltered into a pained look at the thought of Ginny disappearing with Blaise, then he resumed floating beside her as the gentle waves pushed them over to the side of the bath. “You do.”

   

  “I thought we found the cure for that love?” Draco trailed his fingers over her stomach, making Ron wince once more. “Theo said he worked out how to switch your brain off-”

   

  “Did he?” Ron looked up in amazement, “how?”

   

  Draco just laughed then flipped away into an underwater somersault leaving Hermione alone with her blush, “umm...”

   

  “Never mind!” Ron shook his head as Harry joined them, and to Hermione’s relief, talk turned to the Christmas holidays. The returning seventh and eighth years were being given an extended Christmas break. In return for two extra weeks off, Headmistress McGonagall had informed them that they were to complete an in depth written assignment in a NEWT subject of their choice.
 
  Hermione looked up with interest as she tuned into Harry and Ron's conversation. “My overall subject's definitely going to be Defense Against the Dark Arts,” Harry was saying, “I’m just not sure which specific area to focus my report on yet. What about you?”

   

  “Not a clue mate,” Ron shook his head. “Probably the same as you. It will help with Auror training too, I suppose. How about you ‘Mione? Have you decided on yours yet?”

   

  “I’m not totally sure either,” Hermione admitted, frowning in confusion as she heard Draco call her name, despite the fact that he was kissing Theo in the opposite corner of the bath and was apparently paying her no attention at all. She turned her flushed face back to Harry as Draco pulled away from Theo to send a sinful smirk in her direction. “I was thinking of choosing Ancient Runes as my subject then making curse breaking my in depth study. That’s what I want to get into after all.”

   

  “Malfoy Manor is full of books on that sort of thing,” Pansy said, swimming over with Millie to join them. “I’m going with Potions and putting a cookery spin on it since the old bag won’t let me actually study cookery. I mean magical people have to eat, right? Who says I can’t be a chef just because I’m a witch?!”

   

  “Pans, one of these days you’ll call her that to her face. Then you’ll be in trouble.” Harry shook his head in amusement. 

   

  “Oh, I can watch my tongue when I need to. Don’t worry. Anyway, the feeling’s mutual, McGonagall hates me too. Since we started dating she glares at me so hard I worry that my head’s going to explode in Transfiguration. She’s rather protective of you, Harry.”

   

  “Well, what can I say? Save the world once, be head teacher's pet forever,” Harry quipped, then spluttered as Pansy dunked him under the water. 

   

  “I’m going to stick with potions too,” Millie said, giggling at their antics. “Healing potions specifically, since I want to be a healer.”

   

  “Good idea,” Hermione said, feeling impressed with all of their answers. “What are you going to choose for your extra credit projects?” she asked Draco as he and Theo finally swam over to join them.

   

  Draco said nothing, just looked awkwardly at Theo as if hoping to be rescued. Theo stroked his arm gently, obviously catching on. “To be honest, I wasn’t actually going to do it. I’ve already got NEWT scores that I’m happy with, but I’ve changed my mind. Now I’m hoping I can chat Sirius up enough for him to tell me about the animagi process,” he said, neatly covering Draco’s lack of answer. “I want to work with magical creatures, most of which are dangerous. Being able to transform would give me an extra edge for safety. So I think I’ll use it for my project too.”

   

  “I’m sure Sirius would happily talk to you about it,” Hermione said, watching Draco curiously, “do you want to become an animagi then?”

   

  Theo merely shrugged. “Don’t know. But if I can, then why the hell not?”
 
  “I agree,” Ron said, “I’ve always thought animagi are very cool. What NEWT scores did you get then?” 
 
  Theo shrugged. “Outstanding and Exceeds Expectations grades across the board. It’s not just me, though, Draco and Greg got excellent grades too. Amycus Carrow heavily favored us for obvious reasons. I was going to just keep those results and not bother retaking them at all this year, but I’ve changed my mind on that as well.”
 
  “How so?” Pansy asked, wriggling backwards into Harry’s arms.
 
  Theo grimaced. “Well, Draco binned his corrupt results straight away, said he wanted to pass his exams on merit rather than be given them by a Death Eater, myself and Greg weren’t that hasty. But, someone’s had a strange effect on my moral compass just lately so I’ve decided to do the same.”
 
  “Have you really?” Hermione couldn’t help the grin that spread across her face, or the little jig of pleasure she performed as he laughed. “You did that because of me?”
 
  “And Draco. You’re both right of course, I’ll pull my finger out and retake the damn things.”
 
  Draco grinned proudly at Hermione then beat her in pulling Theo close for a kiss. “You’ll do fine. You can do anything you put your mind to, I’ve told you before you're bloody brilliant.”
 
  Theo nodded. “Thanks love. Which is exactly what I said to you, when you got all daft about your own project idea. I don’t think it’s weird at all.”
 
  “Why would it be weird?” Harry challenged, “What do you want to do?”
 
  Draco glared, clearly exasperated with Theo, then huffed out a sigh. “I want to do Defense too. Specialising in dark curses. Proper dark curses I mean. The unforgivable ones. I’ve seen them used, hell I’ve used them myself. I know what goes into casting them and I want to figure out how to block them. There has to be a way to counter a Crucio. Some people can fight an Imperio already. Why can’t we isolate the intention they use to do it and turn that into a counter spell? And, I’m sure there could be a way of blocking an Avada. It's an idea I've had for a long time and I’ve not told anyone except Theo, but every curse in existence has a counter curse. Except for those three. I want to find one for those as well.”
 
  A full beat of complete silence met his words, then Pansy threw her arms round him. “Well I think that’s a brilliant idea. Harry, meet Draco. Draco, meet Harry. If you two combine your studies and work together on this, I reckon you two can change the world."

   

  
    Chapter Text
    
  “Wake up, Granger,” Hermione sat bolt upright at her desk, widened her eyes, and gazed guiltily up at Professor Sinistra. She opened her mouth to apologize for dozing in class, then realized that Professor Sinestra was still thoroughly engrossed in the lesson she was giving. Clearly, it hadn’t been her that had spoken. “Try again, beautiful.”
 
  She closed her eyes and relaxed back into her seat, smiling guiltily as she realized what was happening. Even without the amused edge to his voice, she recognized Draco’s lazy, insolent drawl. “Don’t look round, or you’ll give our little game away. You said I could try this after all.” She sucked in a breath as she felt an invisible finger stroke the side of her face. How did they do this? How? 
 
  Resolving to pump both Draco and Theo for information later, Hermione brushed her hair back and glanced surreptitiously at Harry, sitting beside her. She fought the urge to roll her eyes. Instead of studying the constellation maps that were spread out all over the desk for use in their midnight lesson, Harry was reading all about Puddlemere United’s new seeker in “Quidditch Monthly,” which was laying open on his knees. Hermione supposed it didn’t matter what he was doing, the magazine was holding his attention, which, was good enough for her current needs. “If you want me to stop doing this, raise your left hand. If you want me to continue, raise your right.”
 
  Taking a deep breath, Hermione raised her right hand on the pretense of tucking her hair behind her ears. She shivered as she was rewarded with a “Good girl. Our good girl. Did you like watching us kiss in the bath earlier?” slowly she nodded. “You like watching Theo and me together?” she nodded again as her breathing grew labored. She gasped softly as invisible lips kissed her neck. “Would you like to watch Theo fuck me later?” feeling that nodding too many times might draw unwanted attention to herself, she raised her right hand back into her hair then clenched her thighs together tightly as a powerful tug of arousal washed over her. 
 
  She felt Draco’s lips smile against her neck. “You’d like to see Theo kiss me, push me down onto the bed and slide his thick, hard cock inside me? You’d like to see him thrust in and out of me while he strokes my throbbing shaft until we both come undone?” Hermione gasped so loudly at Draco’s wanton words that Harry looked up from his magazine, regarding her strangely as she bit down on her knuckles to avoid making any more noise. 
 
  Inside her head, Draco chuckled. “Shhh, Granger, or you’ll have some explaining to do. Did that image turn you on? I know you like to see us kiss. I also know you told Theo you want to watch us fuck. Will you touch yourself while we do it? Will you slip your hand into your knickers and rub that perfect little clit of yours? Will you slide your fingers in and out of your soaking wet cunt while you watch Theo fuck me?” Hermione squirmed in her seat. She couldn’t sit still. She wriggled, rocking slightly and trying to bring some relief to her uncomfortably throbbing core. Draco didn’t usually speak like this. While he was more than adept at dirty talk, he usually stopped short of this level of graphic detail. To hear him channeling Theo so boldly just made it all the more arousing.
 
  “Left hand tells me to stop, remember?” Draco whispered, and Hermione gasped as she felt his fingers do precisely what he had just described. She completely zoned out of Professor Sinistra’s lecture, tipped her hair forwards to cover her flushed face, and bit down hard on her thumb as she forced herself to stay quiet while Draco’s invisible fingers brought her to the point of climax.
 
  “Come for me, beautiful,” he whispered, giving her clit one more firm squeeze and sending her flying into oblivion. Hermione tipped her head forwards onto the desk, stifling a whimper as Draco’s invisible fingers stroked her through her intense climax.
 
  As she gradually came back to reality, she remembered where she was. Her eyes widened, and as her senses returned, so did her embarrassment. She lifted her head, aware that her cheeks were flushed bright red, then turned to see Harry eyeing her with concern. “You want to explain that one to Potter, or shall I do it later?” Draco laughed inside her head. “Raise your left hand if you’re cross with me, sweetheart.”
 
  Hermione smiled as little aftershocks of pleasure caused her to shiver again. She raised her right hand to tell him that she was fine. How could he possibly think she would be cross? she wondered. As with all the fetish magic they had tried this week, she had been in full control. She could have told him to stop at any point, and Draco knew that the edge of danger turned her on as just as much as the complexity of the magic involved did. She turned in her seat to see him reclining leisurely in his chair, smirking broadly as Theo smiled beside him. As she watched, he placed his index and middle fingers in his mouth and made a show of pretending to suck them clean. “Delicious,” his voice said inside her head, making her flush all over again. 
 
  “‘Mione!” Harry hissed urgently and she started back to reality. This obviously wasn’t the first time Harry that had called her name.
 
  “Wha-?” she turned hastily back to face him.
 
  “Are you alright? You're acting rather strangely. Your face is flushed and you look flustered. Are you feeling ill? Did you get really cold outside today? Shall I take you to Madam Pomf-”
 
  “No!” she gasped, hearing Draco chuckle as he withdraw from her mind. “No, I’m not ill. I’m fine. I just...oh, Merlin!”
 
  “Hermione,” Harry whispered sternly and she knew he wouldn’t let this drop. Harry only ever used her full name when he was concerned about her. “Tell me what’s wrong.”
 
  She rubbed a hand over her eyes, giggling uncontrollably. “Oh gods, umm, okay. Harry, has Pansy ever done a mind magic thing on you? Where you can… umm, hear her voice inside your head?”
 
  “No,” Harry said, looking baffled. “I didn’t even know that was possible.”
 
  “Nor did I,” Hermione admitted, “until Draco and Theo showed me this fetish sex magic thing. Draco just made me-” to Hermione’s intense relief the bell for the end of class rang and Harry’s incredulous stare was broken by Professor Sinistra dismissing the lesson. 
 
  “He made you what?” Harry asked, staring at her in horror as understanding dawned on him, “you, he, fetish… oh Merlin’s balls! ‘Mione, I was right beside you!!!”
 
  “Want me to obliviate you, Potter?” Theo asked brightly as he sauntered forwards to Hermione’s side. “Hi beautiful. How did it feel to come all over Draco’s invisible fingers like that?”
 
  Hermione met Harry’s startled eyes for a moment, then dissolved into embarrassed giggles as Theo led her away, leaving Harry staring after them with his mouth hanging open. 



  
  The Room of Requirement had outdone itself for the last official girl’s and boy’s night of the game. The room was split in half, as was customary for their Friday night meetings, but both seating areas were set up to be much more cozy and intimate than usual tonight. In keeping with the number of remaining participants, there were fewer chairs as well, although the game still seemed to overlook Harry and Pansy, who, by rights, had been disqualified weeks ago and shouldn’t have actually been there. There was an area at the back of the room that was set up as a dance floor, and finally there was a drinks trolley in the middle of the room that was holding several pitchers of different colored cocktails. 
 
  Once the boys had disappeared to their side of the partition and privacy was ensured with a silencing spell, Hermione sat down between Pansy and Ginny, with Millie, Luna, Parvati, and Hannah opposite. Ginny plucked the weekly instruction sheet from the trolley and read aloud. “The past week was fetish week. Discuss, to your own personal levels of comfort, what you have learned from your week so far.”
 
  Ginny laughed as she caught Pansy’s eye. Pansy stepped forward to the trolley and picked up a large jug labelled Pina Colada as Ginny continued to read. “Prompt questions will appear if needed. Question number one. Did you enjoy your chosen fetish and will you explore it further after this week has ended?” she read. “Oh my, there’s a question to start! ‘Mione, I think you can answer first for a change!” 
 
  Blushing as she accepted her drink from Pansy, Hermione nodded. “Yes I did enjoy it very much indeed!” she giggled as she sipped her drink. “Next person-”
 
  “Oh no you don’t, Miss G!” Ginny squealed. “You're not getting away 
  
    that 
  
  easily. What’s this we’ve heard about you and Draco in your Astronomy class last night?”
 
  Hermione flushed an even deeper red as she laughed. “According to Draco, he had to resort to drastic measures to keep Theo awake after our day out in the snow!”
 
  “A likely excuse,” Pansy grinned wickedly. “Not that I’d be complaining, mind. Harry was suitably horrified, just so you know. Well?”
 
  “Well, what?”
 
  Pansy rolled her eyes. “Don’t play coy Hermione, you know full well we want details. Draco’s done that to me before, a long time ago of course,” Pansy shivered, sweeping her glossy black hair out of her face, “did he do the invisible finger fucking thing?” She broke off, making a crude gesture with her hands as Hermione nodded and everyone in the room pulled their chairs closer together to listen. 
 
  After the substantial amount of “oooohs” and “ahhhs” had subsided, Hermione giggled as she brought her explanation to an end. “Can Blaise do that?” Ginny asked, looking hopefully at Pansy.
 
  “Yep,” Pansy asserted happily. “Ask him about it. I’m not sure if he can do the full corporeal finger thing, but certainly the talking dirty in your head part he can do. Again, I’m speaking from past experience here,” Pansy finished unnecessarily, given how delighted Ginny appeared to be. “What fetsih did you actually choose?” Pansy asked, turning her attention back to Hermione. .
 
  “Dom/sub,” Hermione confessed, laughing yet again as Ginny, Pansy, and Millie mimed fainting onto each other’s shoulders. By the time the conversation finally passed on to Pansy, Hermione needed a refill of her drink. She passed the pitcher around the circle, noticing that it was magically refilling itself, and sat back to listen to Pansy’s tale. 
 
  “So I chose exhibitionism,” Pansy said without any hint of a blush, “and that turned out to be a lot of fun. Didn’t it, Luna? Parvati?” Hermione’s eyebrows shot up at Luna’s agreement and Parvati’s embarrassed but emphatic nodding. “We did it in the Defense classroom, and the Potions lab too, so don’t let Harry play the innocent one with you, Hermione. Mind sex in Astronomy has got nothing on what we did in the dungeons. Potter enjoyed the hint of danger as well, so don’t let him tell you otherwise! It worked out nicely with your chosen fetish too, didn’t it girls?”
 
  “It really did,” Luna agreed, gazing wistfully at Parvati. “I’d never have dreamed you’d be into voyeurism, Pavati, but yes, it worked out perfectly for us. We would definitely like to continue exploring it, if that’s okay with you and Harry, Pansy? What did you choose, Ginny?” Luna asked as Pansy nodded her answer to the question. 
 
  Ginny smirked as she sipped her drink. “Well, since someone swiped the dom/sub card that I had my eye on,” she teased, glancing sideways at Hermione with another giggle, “I went for the next best one on the table, which was BDSM.”
 
  This time Pansy’s gasp was almost as loud as Hermione’s. “That is perfect for Blaise,” Pansy grinned as Ginny nodded, grinning broadly. 
 
  “Well yes. It turns out that it really is. He’s a natural. I’ve spent most of this week tied up, and fully at his mercy, and believe me, there’s nowhere else I’d rather be!” Ginny’s face took on such an uncharacteristic dreamy look that Hermione spluttered on her drink. “So, yes, we will also be continuing to explore our chosen fetish. Hannah?” Ginny asked, “What did you choose for Greg?”
 
  Hannah pushed her blond hair back and smiled. “Well, it was a rather tricky choice for me, mostly because up until this week we hadn’t actually had sex,” she admitted. “I was going to choose romance and take things slowly,” Hannah’s innocent face took on a rather wicked grin as she sipped her drink, “but then, I thought, no! I want to have sex with him. He knows what he’s doing. After all, he’s not a virgin so I, umm,” she broke off, covering her face with her hands and giggling, “I umm, I picked one that surprised him somewhat!”
 
  “What did you choose?” Hermione couldn't help squealing just as loudly as Pansy, Ginny and Pavarti. She sat forward on the edge of her seat, as Hannah withdrew her hands from her flushed cheeks and grinned. “I umm, I chose the sex toys one. I also told him that the only toy I wanted to play with was him!”
 
  The squeals that followed this particular revelation were so loud that despite their silencing spells, Theo stuck his head around the room divider. “You alright in here, ladies?” he asked charmingly, then disappeared as several pairs of hands flapped him impatiently away. “And?!” as soon as Theo had beaten a hasty retreat, Pansy asked the question that was on everybody’s minds, “did you?”
 
  Hannah nodded, still grinning broadly. “We did! And, oh Merlin, it was so perfect. I’m glad I took the plunge. Although I thought he was going to die of shock when I first showed him the card I’d chosen! I have no plans to continue that particular fetish, but it got us to where I wanted to be.”
 
  “Awwww!!!” Ginny squealed, “that’s perfect. I’m so pleased for you, Hannah. Which leaves, oh God’s I really don’t want to ask this Mille, but umm, please, bearing in mind this is my brother we’re discussing, so be gentle, what did you choose?”
 
  “I actually did choose the romance prompt,” Millie said sweetly. “I was expecting Hannah to take that one, so I was quite pleased when I saw it still on the table. I don’t want to embarrass you, Ginny, but your brother is such a lovely man. I won’t go into my past too much because I try not to think about it, but I’ve had some rather terrible relationship influences in my life. My mum has a new boyfriend every other week. I just... Yes. Ron’s not like that is he?”
 
  “No.” Ginny said proudly. “He’s not. None of my brothers are, and I’m including Harry in that generalization too. They’re all gentlemen, I’m probably the wildest one in the family when it comes to relationships, or so they all tell me when they’re being unnecessarily protective, but I’m very pleased that Ron’s treating you well, Millie. You're good together.”
 
  Millie nodded as Pansy lifted down a different pitcher of cocktails, this one a lurid looking orange. “Sex on the Beach,” Pansy read the note attached to the handle, “and we need to share a memorable tale from the previous week.”
 
  “The potions lab,” Pansy said as Parvati hid her face again. “Because what we didn’t tell you earlier was that we were almost, 
  
    almost 
  
  caught. Slughorn opened the door, and Merlin, I knew Harry was quick with his wand, but god’s, I grew up with Draco and even he’s not that fast with a confounding spell. I’ve never seen Slughorn move so quick! It was impressive magic. All the more so, given what Harry was doing at the time.”
 
  “It’s a good thing he was fast,” Luna agreed, “I think that would have been a quite tricky situation to explain otherwise.”
 
  “You dont say!” Pansy agreed with an incredulous laugh. “Picture this, Harry had me bent over Slughorn’s desk, he was fucking me to within an inch of my life, and these two were getting it on while watching us. Yeah. That would have been a tricky one to get out of. Luna, Parvati, did you know that we got just as turned on from watching you two together, as you did by us?”
 
  Parvati choked on her drink in response to Pansy’s words and Luna patted her gently on the back. “Did you? That’s so lovely,” Luna answered as Parvati caught her breath, “would you like to join us next time? Assuming it’s okay with you, Parvati, that is,” Luna turned to consider her girlfriend, “I mean you have expressed a desire to try a group scene in the past.”
 
  “Luna!” Parvati wailed looking comically distraught, “You can’t just 
  
    say
  
   things like that!”
 
  “Why ever not?” Luna asked, looking genuinely confused. “You said-”
 
  Parvati buried her face in her hands once more, “I know what I said, but,”
 
  “I’d love to, if it makes you feel any easier,” Pansy said, cutting through Parvati’s hysterics. “Harry’s more than up for it too. I already asked him. He nearly died at the thought of having three girls at once and I’ve been with women in the past so there’s no concerns there.”
 
  “Really?” Parvati still looked flustered as she finally emerged from behind her hands. 
 
  “Think about it.” Pansy nodded, “But yeah, we’re more than up for it. Anyway, that’s that. Anyone else got a story to tell?!”

   

  “Blaise and I managed to have sex on his broom,” Ginny blurted, still staring incredulously between Pansy, Luna, and Parvati. “Without either of us falling off, too! I was tied to it with a heavy cushioning charm in place, and, yeah, it was incredible to do that while flying through the starry sky. That one will stay with me for a long time!” she ran her fingers through her flaming hair and smiled, her blue eyes alight with mischief, “we found a handy spell for it too, if anyone’s interested?”
 
  “Oh my god’s, Gin,” Hermione said before her brain caught up with what she was saying. “Yes! Tell me!! Draco would love that, so would Theo come to think of it-”
 
  Ginny cackled gleefully, “I bet they would. Imagine it ‘Mione, you, stripped naked, tied to a broom handle while they fuck you hundreds of feet up in the air!!”
 
  Hermione did a perfect reenactment of Parvati’s embarrassed squeal from a few minutes prior, then looked Ginny directly in the eye as she laughed. “I need to tell them about this.”
 
  “Me too,” Pansy grinned. “Harry can fly well enough to pull that off too. Plus we’d be safe from Slughorn’s prying eyes,” she shuddered with a freshly horrified look as Ginny nodded. “But for now, come on Hannah. I’m dying to hear about your first time,” Pansy’s eyes took on a dreamy quality as she turned to survey a blushing Hannah, “tell us 
  
    everything.
  
  ”
 
  “Oh, it was beautiful,” Hannah said softly, “I mean it sounds rather tame in comparison to all of your wild stories, but I don’t care. He looked after me so well. It was in his bed, in the dorms, and it was just… perfect.”
 
  “That’s good. I’m so pleased your first time was like that,” clearly glad to have the heat taken away from her, Parvati turned to Hannah as she sipped her drink. “Has Greg just changed massively, or did we have him pegged wrongly all along?”
 
  “He’s changed,” Millie answered simply as Hannah looked at her for help. Millie pulled her legs up under her on the sofa and held out her glass accepting a refill from Pansy. “After Draco realized what he was getting into with the Death Eaters and started wishing he could back out, they all changed. The only one who didn’t was Vincent, and unfortunately Vince held a lot of power over Greg. Greg was always in his shadow, he’s very easily led, you see. When Vince died, Greg was freed. It didn’t take him long to turn to Draco and Draco pulled him out of the hole he’d gotten himself into.” 
 
  Pansy nodded her agreement. “Theo never liked Greg much in those days, nor did Blaise. Neither of them could stand Vince so there was always a rift between our boys. I’m sorry to say it, Hermione, but I think Theo would have just left Greg to burn then, that’s how strongly he felt about the Death Eater movement, and he thought that Greg had bought into it way too much. It was Draco who took Greg under his wing and made the other two accept him. Now all four of them are as close as can be.”
 
  “That’s pretty much what Greg’s told me too,” Hannah confirmed. “He credits Draco with his redemption, Theo for kicking him up the backside and making him see sense, and Blaise for never really siding against him in the first place. He also thinks very highly of you Pansy, and you, Millie. Anyway,” Hannah turned back to Millie, “we haven’t heard your story yet, have we? What’s your most memorable moment from your week with Ron?” 
 
  Millie smiled broadly as she answered. “Ron took me into Hogsmeade for dinner. We walked back and he took me up to his bed. There were rose petals all over it and a bottle of champagne and strawberries, and yes, we did have quite a lot of sex afterwards. It was just perfect. Why are you frowning, Ginny?”
 
  “I’m sorry,” Ginny apparently couldn’t contain her giggle. If she was honest Hermione was rather surprised by the sound of this herself. “It’s just, if you’d grown up with Ron... I’m just struggling to imagine him scattering rose petals over a bed and buying champagne. That’s something Bill or one of the twins would do. It’s like imagining Charlie ballet dancing or 
  Percy not folding his socks.... Look, never mind. As we said, people change. Which brings me neatly on to you, Hermione!” Ginny poked her tongue out as Hermione crossed her eyes comically, “Which of your many lurid experiences tops this week?”
 
  Hermione blushed as she thought back. There were quite a few to choose from. “Spanking,” she admitted before she lost her nerve. “I’d never tried it before and it was intense.”
 
  Hermione lifted a brow as the others collapsed into yet more tipsy sounding giggles. “Theo by any chance?” Pansy asked.
 
  Hermione nodded, feeling yet another blush creep up the side of her neck. “Both of them, actually. But yeah, Theo was the one who made me lose my mind with it-” she broke off as the partition magically disappeared and both sides of the room suddenly joined together as one. Soft music started to play and the lights dimmed to a subtle glow. “What’s going on?” Hermione asked, grabbing at a piece of parchment that fluttered down from the ceiling. “You are required to join together with your partners for the rest of the evening,” she read. 
 
  They stared at each other in confusion until Theo stood up to take his usual theatrical bow. “Good evening ladies and gents. This is our last Friday night game meeting, as next Friday marks the start of the Christmas holidays. We are free to have our own little Christmas party tonight, if we so choose. Or, if you prefer, you can bugger off and shag. Given all the squealing that’s been going on over at this side of the room you’ve apparently had a lot to discuss, so do with the rest of your time as you see fit!”






  “Do I want to know what got you lot all so excited tonight?” Draco asked a little later as he took Hermione into his arms for a dance.
 
  “Possibly not,” she smiled against his neck, breathing in and filling her lungs with his familiar, comforting scent. “We just had some written prompt questions, asking us to share our experiences from fetsih week. That combined with a lot of cocktails made for a bit of a squealy evening.'' The irony of this wasn’t lost on Hermione. She had spent most of her life viewing that kind of girlish behavior with disdain, and now she was not only partaking in it herself, she was thoroughly enjoying it too. 
 
  All sorts of rather interesting relationships had been formed in this game, she realized. It was about the friendships they had all formed, as much as it was about the sexual encounters. Although she had been unsure of it at the start, she could now admit that it was a brilliant invention of the Marauders. The thought of their newly close, developing friendships made her feel sad about all the lost years of antagonism and missed opportunities they had endured up until now. Could things have been vastly different if house unity had been made more of a thing at Hogwarts right from the start?
 
  “I see. And what did you share?” Draco asked, starling her out of her daydream.
 
  “Umm…. everything?” she said, dragging her thoughts back to the present.
 
  Everything?” he asked skeptically as Hermione swayed on her feet. “Merlin, help us! How much have you all had to drink?” 
 
  “Some,” she rested her head on his shoulder as the alcohol she had consumed suddenly caught up with her.
 
  “Some?” Draco raised a brow. “Your sounding about as technical as Theo does when he talks about pointy trees and uses - ‘when it’s ready’ - as an acceptable measurement of time in potion brewing.”
 
  Hermione laughed. “He’s usually right though.”
 
  “That he is,” Draco agreed, kissing her neck. “Git.”
 
  “Who’s a git, darling?” Theo asked as Draco deliberately bumped Hermione into him. 
 
  “You are,” Draco teased with a wink as Theo shrugged, clearly not feeling the need to argue. 
 
  “If you say so.” He stepped up behind Hermione then closed his arms around her and Draco, rolling his hips to push her firmly into Draco’s erection. “Do you remember the first time we both held you like this?” Theo asked. Hermione smiled as she nodded. “I wasn’t sure if you and Draco were going to get on alright or kill each other. I’m glad it worked out like this, there’s less bodies to hide this way too.”
 
  Draco smirked, “your romantic streak is strong tonight I see,” he quipped. “That last comment aside, I’m glad it worked out like this too,” he confessed, kissing Hermione until her already unsteady knees buckled, then catching her before immediately turning his head to Theo, “this is just perfection.”
 
  “It is,” Theo agreed, kissing Draco heatedly as Hermione continued to melt against them both, “and just think Draco, we’ve actually got somewhere good to go for the holidays this time. No more empty manor houses or stuffy pureblood customs. I’m looking forwards to it already.”
 
  “Me too,” Draco admitted, nuzzling his face into Hermione’s hair and nipping her earlobe. “Is this a good time to tell you both something?”
 
  “Depends what it is,” Theo dipped his head to kiss the other side of Hermione’s neck and she pressed herself closer into him.
 
  “I wrote to my father, telling him about you two. He wrote back. Offering his 
  congratulations and inviting us to visit him at Christmas.”
 
  Hermione staggered in surprise as Theo suddenly sagged against her. “Oh thank fuck for that!” he exclaimed into her hair, “because that means I’m not the only one who did that. I wasn’t quite sure how to tell you, but I did the same. I’ve promised that we’ll go and see my dad in a couple of weeks too.”
 
  Draco just nodded. “What did he say?” 
 
  Theo smiled. “Lots of things. It was the chattiest letter I’ve ever gotten from him actually. He likes you, Draco, he always has. He says that he hopes you’ve stopped beating yourself up about 
  
    things
  
  . I think he was a little surprised by our relationship. I’ve never actually told him I’m bisexual, but he didn’t seem overly bothered by it. He didn’t comment on the triad aspect of things at all. And he was very impressed with you Hermione. He said, and I quote, 'she’s a good strong witch.'”
 
  “What he means by that, is that you're powerful,” Draco translated as Theo laughed. “He met you twice. In the Department of Mysteries and again during the Battle of Hogwarts, and both times he ducked away rather than face you. Not that Thoronus would have stood against a child anyway, but you impressed him even back then.”
 
  “He never understood how Dolohov’s curse didn’t kill you,” Theo agreed. “It killed everyone else that the lunatic ever cast it on, yet you survived. My dad always had a healthy respect for you after that. Will you come and meet him with me? Please? I want to show you off.”
 
  Hermione closed her eyes, losing herself to the gentle beat of the music. “Of course,” she replied, swaying softly against them both. “Was Lucius really okay with this Draco? Us I mean? You're not just saying that he accepted it when he didn’t really?”
 
  Draco nodded, dropping a line of kisses into her hair as she swayed sleepily against him. “My father’s changed a lot, Hermione, he’s not the man he used to be. Yes, he’s fine with you, and me, and Theo. He just wants me to be happy. And if you both make me happy, well, that's good enough for him.”
 
  “In that case,” Hermione agreed, feeling her eyes close despite her best efforts,  “count me in. I’d love to come with you both.”






  
    Chapter Text
    
  The next morning Hermione woke up to a pounding headache and an unsettled stomach. She opened her eyes, only to immediately slam then shut against the light of what appeared to be two miniature suns, blazing directly inside the bed hangings. She groaned in confusion, flung a hand over her eyes, and wondered why the bed felt so unusually cold. Feeling around, she discovered it was empty on both sides. She frowned against the throbbing, piercing pain in her head, but there was definitely no sign of Draco or Theo, and by the cool feel of the sheets, they had both gotten up a while ago.
 
  She winced as she thought back to the previous evening. She remembered drinking, a lot of drinking, and a fun, though alarmingly squeal filled gossip session with her girlfriends. She remembered dancing with Draco and Theo. Then her eyes widened in alarm as she vaguely remembered agreeing to visit Lucius Malfoy and Theo’s father in Azkaban, but from then on, she drew a complete blank. Try as she might, she couldn't remember the party ending, getting back to the dormitories, or going to bed. 
 
  She blinked again as the bed hangings moved and something large and silver stalked regally out through them. Finally dragging herself into a sitting position, she turned to look at the remaining source of blinding, silver light. Theo’s lioness Patronus was curled up like an oversized kitten at the end of the bed, watching over her carefully. “Where are they?” she asked, but of course, the lioness said nothing. She just moved closer and pushed her wispy head under Hermione’s hand, asking for a stroke in the same way that Harry’s stag often did. Ignoring the strange feeling of stroking something non corporeal, Hermione grinned as the lioness moved up the bed then stretched out beside her, pressing against her side much as Theo himself did every night. 
 
  Hermione took several deep, slow breaths. She wasn’t sure what to do. She truly felt terrible, and she had no prior experience with hangovers to fall back on. Why on earth had she drunk so much? She closed her eyes, trying to remember more details from the previous evening. There had been lots of ready mixed cocktails laid out on a trolley. Pina Colada, Sex on the Beach, something purple, and maybe even something blue as well. She shivered, feeling her stomach roll yet again at the thought of the alcohol that had gotten her into this state.
 
  “Morning, sleepyhead,” a male voice called from outside the bed hangings, “are you decent? Can I come in?”
 
  “Umm, yes. You can,” she answered vaguely. She recognized the voice, her befuddled brain just wouldn’t register who it belonged to. “Come in.”
 
  Mercifully, it was Blaise who drew back the curtains while holding a selection of potion vials in his hand. “Oh, dear,” he said with a lopsided grin. “You don’t look much better off than Ginny. Hannah’s feeling pretty poorly this morning too. Here. Start with this. It’s hangover potion. In fact, do what the others have done, take a double dose. Then there’s a vit-a-potion pick me up, and finally, Pepper up.”
 
  “Thank you.” She pushed her unruly hair back and downed the hangover potion gratefully, despite her stomach’s protest. “Where’s?” she didn’t have the energy to finish the sentence. She just gestured weakly to the empty bed and to Theo’s lioness, who was edging hopefully closer to Blaise. 
 
  “Gone to check on the Bowtruckles. It’s still awfully snowy out there. They’re helping Hagrid make sure all the forest creatures are coping with the conditions. Meanwhile, I’m on nurse duty looking after all of you. What on earth happened on your side of the divide last night? I’m even checking in on Pansy in the Gryffindor dorms too, since she won’t move out of Harry’s bed-”
 
  “‘Mione, I think I’ve died,” Ginny called weakly across the dorms, “how are you feeling?”
 
  “Same,” Hermione muttered, although she was starting to feel marginally better as the hangover potion started to work. “Are we supposed to be going to Grimmauld later?”
 
  “Yep,” Blaise said, smoothing her bedsheets gently. Hermione smiled. It seemed that underneath his usually aloof exterior, he too had a softer, more caring side. “Well,” he said, passing her the next potion and scratching the lioness behind her ears, “Theo and Draco are definitely going. They promised to brew the Wolfsbane for Remus, and that needs to be done today. I’m also told that a cooked breakfast will sort you both out. Although I’m not totally convinced by that myself. It’s not how I was taught to cure a hangover.”
 
  “What do you do in Italy when you have a hangover then?” Ginny wrapped Blaise’s duvet around herself like a toga, stumbled across the cold dorms then plopped down into bed beside Hermione. Ginny was still in her nightshirt, her hair was a tangled mess, and she snuggled backwards into Hermione’s side, reminding Hemrione strongly of all the times she and Ginny had shared a bed at the Burrow when they were younger. 
 
  “Comfy in there is it?” Blaise asked, lifting an amused brow. “In Italy, we swear by a double espresso and a bowl of simple spaghetti. Italians call hangovers 
  
    postumi della sbornia,
  
   it literally means ‘
  the after-death of drunkenness,’ which I think is quite fitting this morning, don’t you?”
 
  Ginny just grunted then snuggled closer against Hermione, and Hermione out of a long held memory started to play with her hair, a gesture that had always comforted both of them in the past. “Are you coming in to join us, handsome?” Ginny asked, gazing up at Blaise hopefully. “Alternatively, you can just keep speaking Italian to us, either option will do.”  
 
  Blaise patted the patronus, watched it slowly fade away into smokey vapor, then leaned down to kiss Ginny tenderly on the lips. “I think Theo might hex me six ways to Sunday if I get in the same bed as his girlfriend,” he said with a laugh. “I’m going flying for a bit anyway. We’re heading to Grimmauld at midday. You’ve got an hour of sleep left, girls.” 
 
  Hermione nodded, thanked him for the potions then leaned back into the mass of pillows, falling asleep with Ginny’s hair still in her hand before Blaise had properly closed the bed curtains.
 
  She woke an hour later to find her legs tangled up with Ginny’s, and Draco and Theo watching them both incredulously. “Fuck me!” was all Theo said, while Draco merely smiled and continued dropping his soaking wet clothes into a pile on the floor. 
 
  “I can see you ogling me Weasley,” he smirked, grabbing a towel on his way to the shower, “so don’t pretend you’re still asleep.”
 
  Ginny laughed as she rubbed her eyes. “You're quite a nice sight to wake up to, actually. You’re pretty, Malfoy. It’s a shame Blaise doesn't like men. You two would look good together.”
 
  “I’ve often thought that,” Theo agreed, also undressing shamelessly on the other side of the bed, “still, even if Blaise decides he’s curious, I'm not sharing Draco now.”
 
  “That’s a shame,” Ginny said. “Although, you’re very pretty too. Come here,” Theo grinned as she propped herself up on one elbow and beckoned him closer. “Which tattoos did Blaise do?”
 
  “These,” Theo pointed out the snake, the clock, and the time turner hiding amongst the flowers on his upper arm. “This was the first one he ever did on an actual person,” Theo pointed out a simple filigree heart with initials inside on his hip. “I’m going to get him to do a couple more in the holidays.”
 
  “He’s really good!” Ginny said, looking impressed. “What do the letters stand for? I’m going to see if he’ll do one for me too, I think.”
 
  “F.N. Their my Mother’s initials. Florence Nott, the only woman I’d have tattooed on my body, aside from you, love.” Theo threw Hermione a wink as he kicked his sodden clothes into a heap then headed for the bathroom.
 
  “Hermione smiled, disentangled herself from the sheets and sat up with an enormous yawn. “That’s risky Gin, what on earth will your brothers say?”
 
  “They can say whatever they like,” Ginny asserted, finally getting out of bed as well. “Charlie’s in no position to talk. He’s got more than Theo. Bill’s got a few as well. So have the twins. None of them have any right to complain. Percy disapproves of everything anyway, so we’ll just ignore whatever he says, and Ron, well,” she waved her hand dismissively. “It’s Ron.” Ginny grinned wickedly as Hermione nodded. “Right. Nice as it was to stare at your naked boyfriends, ‘Mione, I’m going for a shower myself. I’ll see you at Grimmauld in a bit.”

  
  
  

  
  

  Despite the copious amounts of hangover potion she had consumed, Hermione still slept for another hour before getting up. The floo journey to Grimmauld Place was decidedly unpleasant. She staggered as she emerged from the fireplace and took the steadying hand that Sirius offered. “Amateurs, the lot of you,” he grinned as he pulled her forwards into his arms, almost toppling her off of her already unsteady feet. “At least you’re here though Kitten. Pansy and Millie haven’t made it.”
 
  “Seriously,” Ron said, shaking his head, “Millie passed out mid- well, never mind. What on earth were you all drinking last night?”
 
  “Cocktails,” Hermione groaned, leaning her head onto Sirius’s shoulder and breathing in the lingering scent of his leather jacket. “But believe me, I’ve learned my lesson. I’m never drinking again.”
 
  Sirius laughed as he released her. She sat down at the table, sighed and ran a hand over her still slightly bleary eyes. “What you need is more practice.”
 
  “What you need is a cooked breakfast,” Remus countered. He lifted a plate, that had obviously been held under a stasis charm, over to the table and placed it in front of her. 
 
  “Try it ‘Mione,” Ginny said, seeing Hermione’s dubious look. “I looked at mine the same way, but after a couple of bites it did help. If all else fails, you know where the toilet is.”
 
  “Thanks, Gin!” Hermione managed a small laugh as she started to cut into her eggs.
 
  “To be honest, Hermione, you looked brighter when you and Ginny were trying to entice me into your bed this morning,” Blaise said, smirking at Theo as he entered the kitchen, then spun around to glare at him, “it’s alright Nott, I turned them down, enticing though they were all tangled up together, I didn’t fancy losing an eye.”
 
  “You’re lucky, Zabini,” Theo growled, “that I’m otherwise engaged this afternoon. Also, I’ve come up here wandless so unless you want a punch in the-”
 
  “Easy, petal,” Blaise grinned, clearly enjoying goading Theo, “we both know I could take you anyday.”
 
  “Blaise was a little put out that I called you and Draco pretty this morning.” Ginny interjected as everyone, even Hermione, ignored their now familiar squabbling.
 
  “I am pretty,” Theo grinned, giving Blaise a wink, “is that why you're drawing those? Let's have a look?”
 
  “I’m getting this one,” Ginny pointed to a winged golden snitch as Blaise held out a sheaf of sketched tattoo designs. “It’s going to flit around when you press it so it’s impossible to catch.”
 
  “No snitch is impossible to catch,” Harry said absently, flicking through a different notepad of designs, then looking up to meet Blaise’s lifted brow, “Oh I didn’t mean, not on Gin, oh never mind!”
 
  Blaise just smirked, “Relax Harry, I know what you meant. Theo’s the only one who pushes his luck like that around here. Did you want something anyway, Nott? Only you’re hovering over my shoulder with a pinny on.”
 
  “Oh, yeah.” Theo blinked, “It’s a potions apron not a pinny, Zabini. Which you’d know if you were any good at the subject yourself. Draco sent me to get the pestle and mortar please.”
 
  “It’s in the... here,” Remus said, taking an ancient looking stone bowl and grinder from a floor level cupboard. “We’ve never ground anything for Wolfsbane before though.”
 
  “Well, we’re using Snape’s old recipe and it definitely recommends grinding over fine chopping. Although, if you’d prefer we can-”
 
  “Snape’s old recipe?” Sirius said, looking up from Blaise’s designs, “how did Draco manage to get that? Much as it pains me to admit it, Remus says Snape made the best Wolfsbane he’s ever taken. We tried everything to get hold of that recipe!”
 
  “I think Snape left it to Draco in his will. Godfatherly bequests or something,” Theo said, looking surprised. He took the mortar and pestle from Remus and glanced back at Blaise, “find me a good one, will you please, B? I fancy something new,” he broke off as a wicked grin crossed Blaise’s face, “On second thought, maybe I’ll wait for a day when I haven’t insulted your potions prowess.” 
 
  Blaise merely laughed as Theo blew Hermione a kiss then left the room. She pushed her mostly finished plate aside. As usual, the others had been right. She did indeed feel much better now that her stomach was full. “Better Kitten?” Sirius asked, taking her plate and helping himself to the sausage she’d left. 
 
  “Yes, thank you. Blaise,” she began, casting a nervous glance around the room. She swallowed, realizing that she trusted every single one of the people gathered here with her life, she had nothing to hide from any of them. She indicated her forearm, where Bellatrix had carved the vile mudblood slur into her skin. “Do you think you could cover this scar up?”
 
  Blaise canted his head to the side and motioned her to come closer. She saw Sirius exchange a surprised look with Harry before she resolutely turned her face away then offered her arm to Blaise. He gently pushed her sleeve up to study the offensive wording. 
 
  Merely having the scar on display made Hermione uncomfortable. Even though she was the one who had brought the subject up, she suddenly wanted to yank her arm away from Blaise’s unreadable scrutiny and pretend she’d never mentioned it. Looking at her mutilated forearm still caused her a mixture of shame, anger and fear and she tried to keep it hidden as much as possible. 
 
  The tension in the kitchen was becoming unbearable. She glanced down at the jagged red letters standing out as angry and brutal looking as ever and felt tears well in her eyes. She bit them back as Remus put a supportive hand on her other shoulder. “I’d be very nervous about doing anything with this directly, Hermione,” Blaise said eventually, and it was only then that she realized his fingers were directly over her pulse point. “I’ll be honest, your heart’s racing just from showing it to me, which shows how much it still upsets you. I’m not that experienced, and given the way the skin’s bunched as it’s healed, it might not take the ink quite as we’d like it to. But, here’s an alternative idea, why don’t you take a leaf out of Theo’s book and highlight it instead?”
 
  “Highlight it?” she asked, staring at him in horror, “why woul-”
 
  “Wait a minute, hear me out,” Blaise stroked over the scars gently then picked up his wand, using it to test things she didn’t understand. “You can’t cover a Dark Mark with a tat either. The ink doesn't take properly and it just ends up looking ridiculous. I fear this might be a similar situation. Have you ever wondered why Theo’s got a snake on his arm? Especially given his controversial upbringing and the design’s link to the Death Eater cause?”
 
  “Well, yes actually,” she admitted. “I have wondered. I’ve just never liked to ask.”
 
  Blaise nodded. “Well, It's actually his way of sticking two fingers up at all of that. Theo was never officially inducted into the Death Eaters because his father risked everything to keep him safe, but it didn’t really matter because everyone just assumed that he was marked regardless. He had a choice when the Dark Lord fell. Either embrace that side of himself and make peace with it, or try to deny it, which would probably have driven him mad. So, in typical Theo fashion, he decided to own it. You could do the same here. We could highlight the word in a pretty color, put a beautiful design all around it and turn the bad feelings associated with it into something much more positive.”
 
  Blaise finally released her arm and Hermione sat back to study him intently as she considered his suggestion. “I’ve honestly never thought about it like that,” she said slowly. She looked around the room as her mind opened up to this new way of thinking. A tear fell from her eye and she swallowed hard. “What do you all think?”
 
  “Well I know what I’d do, Kitten,” Sirius said with a somewhat proud grin. “I’m always up for giving a big ‘fuck you’ to the world.”
 
  “You 
  
    were
  
   sorted into Gryffindor for a reason, ‘Mione,” Harry said, looking thoroughly impressed with the idea himself, “and that’s rather a bold, Gryffindor-ish thing to do.”
 
  “I’d do it in a heartbeat,” Ginny agreed.
 
  Hermione nodded, then glanced at Remus, and finally Ron. “You need to think about it properly,” Remus said, “Don’t rush into anything. But if you can’t cover it up and it bothers you that much, then yes, enhancing it tastefully is what I'd do.”
 
  Finally Hermione met Ron’s clear blue gaze. “I don’t like to see that scar,” he admitted, holding up a hand as everyone turned to glare at him, “hold up a minute, I’m not still a completely insensitive prat you know. I don’t like to see it because I listened to every single scream of yours that day. Every noise you made, every whimper, every cry tore through my heart like that bloody knife tore through your arm. I’d have traded places with you instantly. I saw you collapsed on the floor. I thought she’d killed you, ‘Mione, and I’ve never been so 
  scared in all my life. The fact that you still hide your arm away tells me that you haven't accepted what happened either. So yes, I say make it beautiful. That would piss Bellatrix off more than anything, I reckon.”
 
  Nobody said anything for a long moment. Finally, Hermione stood up, crossed the room and as Ron opened his arms she sank down into his embrace. He wrapped his arms around her and she held him as her remaining tears fell. When she eventually stood back up, Ginny was wiping her own eyes, as was Harry. “I’m going to see how Draco and Theo are getting on, but I promise to think carefully about it,” she said slowly, then bolted from the room.
 
  Instead of going outside she fled upstairs, not really sure where she was going and somehow ending up in the tapestry room. The whole of Grimmauld Place had recently undergone complete renovation and this room was now nothing like the dark, doxy infested, cursed room it had once been. Now, it was bright and airy, decorated in cool creams and blues. She paced up and down in front of the ancient embroidery, trying to work out why she felt so unsettled. Two things were going through her mind, one, that she really, really, liked Blaise’s idea, and two, she was an absolute, flaming hypocrite. 
 
  She knew that Millie would have been upset to witness the exchange she had just shared with Ron. Rightly or wrongly, if she’d seen Draco or Theo share a similar moment with Pansy, or heaven forbid, with Daphne, 
  
    she
  
   would have overreacted herself. She 
  
    had 
  
  overreacted when Theo had gone into Hogsmeade with them. 
 
  She blew out a huffy breath and turned to face the tapestry. She followed the Black family line from Orion and Walburga Black down to where Sirius’ burn hole had once been, then burst out laughing. The angry black scorch mark was now framed, and the burn was signed, “Sirius Black, AKA Padfoot.” A muddy paw print completed the autograph. A painted line then connected Sirius’ frame with another frame, this one bearing the words “Remus Lupin, AKA Moony,” and a paw print that looked suspiciously like a werewolf’s. 
 
  It seemed when it came to owning the controversial sides of themselves, she was surrounded by people who did so with style. 
 
  Hermione followed the tapestry back up to a line that split into three. Andromeda Black now had a frame around her own scorch mark, but Hermione looked past that to the dot labelled Bellatrix Black and to the line that connected her by marriage to Rodolphus Lestrange. She scowled furiously at both names, briefly considered adding two of her own scorch marks to the tapestry, then let her eyes travel to where Bellatrix’s sister Narcissa’s dot was connected to Lucius Malfoy’s, and then on down the line to Draco. 
 
  Even seeing Draco’s name calmed her. He’s been through a lot in the war too, and yet he was managing to heal. He no longer worried about hiding his Dark Mark away and Hermione knew that it was time for her to do the same with her mudblood scar. She pressed a finger to her lips, kissed it, touched the kiss to Draco’s dot, then headed back downstairs. 
 
  With her head finally feeling clear, she stepped outside. It hadn’t snowed in London, although it had been raining non stop for days and the courtyard garden was awash. Trying 
  not to splash too much through the puddles she sidestepped a patch of mud then ducked into the makeshift brewing shed. “Hey,” she smiled as Draco looked up from the cauldron. 
 
  “Shhh… he’s counting stirs,” Theo whispered, meeting her at the door with a kiss. “No wonder they hate brewing this. It’s a nightmare, and I like potions!!”
 
  “It’s high stakes if you bugger it up too,” Draco admitted, looking tense as he lifted the ladle and watched the cerise blue liquid fall back into the cauldron. 
 
  “Which you won’t,” Hermione wrinkled her nose, “is it meant to smell, uh-”
 
  “Like burning socks mixed with cheap air freshener?” Theo asked, “apparently so.”
 
  Draco nodded. “Also, the worse it tastes, the better it works too. So I’m hoping this batch is particularly foul. I’ve followed Snape’s recipe to the letter, but it does differ from the official one. Severus also recommends brewing it for twenty four hours rather than twelve. So what are the chances of us staying over tonight?” 
 
  “Pretty good I’d say,” Sirius said. He and Remus stepped into the now crowded cabin and shut the door against the rain. “You alright Kitten? We couldn’t find you.” She nodded but said no more, and mercifully they let the subject drop. Sirius nodded his understanding then peered into the cauldron. “You know, it kills me to say this, because I despised the man, but I’m glad you’ve got his recipe, and I appreciate you both doing this. I’ll sort you out a bedroom in a minute.”
 
  “You know, Severus wasn’t actually that bad-” Draco began, but Remus chuckled. 
 
  “That ones a lost cause, I’m afraid,” Remus admitted. “If you imagine your rivalry with Harry when it was at its worst, that was Sirius and Severus on a good day.”
 
  Draco pulled a comically horrified face and said no more. “That smells like the version Severus used to make when I was teaching at Hogwarts,” Remus said, stepping back to let Sirius see into the cauldron. “Thank you Draco.”
 
  “No problem at all,” Draco said, preening at the compliment.

  
  

  
  

  “Are you going to watch that all night, Malfoy? Snape’s written that you can stir it every four hours at this stage, but you're hovering over there like an expectant mother,” Theo grinned, stretched his long legs out on the swing seat and chuckled as Draco flipped him off and continued to gaze into the cauldron of Wolfsbane. 
 
  “Sirius is like this when we make it,” Remus admitted, topping up their wineglasses and smiling as Hermione winced, and Pansy, who had only made it out of bed for the evening, groaned. “More lemonade girls?” he asked brightly, then obligingly levitated a top up their way. 
 
  “I’m never drinking again,” Pansy wailed dramatically, nestling into Harry.
 
  “I said that earlier,” Hermione agreed sympathetically, ignoring the look Sirius and Theo exchanged.  
 
  “Why would there be four different jugs of cocktails that all magically refill themselves?” Pansy continued, then sat up sharply to glare accusingly at Sirius, “actually, yeah. Why? You two designed that game didn’t you?” she turned around to level an affronted stare at Remus as well, “Why would you do that to us?”
 
  “We can’t be held accountable for your lack of judgement, I’m afraid,” Sirius grinned, “no one forced any of you to keep drinking them, did they?” Pansy harrumphed as Sirius tossed a pack of cigarettes to Theo then lit one himself with a click of his fingers. 
 
  “Ta,” Theo looked up as Draco finally left the Wolfsbane in favor of joining them. He sat down, leaning towards the firepit shivering.
 
  “Thanks love,“ he said as Hermione wrapped a fleece blanket around his shoulders. “It’s eleven now. We started brewing twelve hours ago. I’ll stir it every four hours through the night, but you’ll have to take it off the heat at eleven on the dot tomorrow, as we’ll be in class.”
 
  “No problem,” Remus said. “And I really can't thank you two enough for this. It’s much appreciated. If there's anything we can do in return?”
 
  “Well, actually,” Theo said, sitting back further to give Draco room to settle beside him, “I was wondering if I could talk to you about the animagi process. I want to base my extra credit NEWT assignment on that.”
 
  Sirius looked at him in surprise, “of course. What do you want to know?”
 
  “Everything. How the process works, as much as you're willing to share basically.”
 
  “You're on.” Sirius nodded. “When you're over here during the holidays we’ll sit down and you can ask anything you like.”
 
  “Can you do it now?” Pansy asked, looking excited, “I mean, I know it might be difficult, and don’t worry if you- oh!” she squealed as Sirius set his cigarette down in the ashtray and with a small pop transformed into Padfoot. He trotted around the table, stuck his nose into Harry’s face then jumped up to put both paws gently on Pansy’s lap, his tail wagging excitedly.
 
  Harry laughed at Pansy’s surprise and Padfoot pushed his head under her hand, asking for an ear stroke. Gingerly Pansy obliged, and a few moments later Padfoot backed up and with another pop turned back into a highly amused looking Sirius.
 
  Pansy sighed, looking at him dreamily. “Harry, I swear to Merlin you’ve got the coolest family in the world.”
 
  Sirius smiled proudly as he sat back down and laughed at Remus’ look of exasperation. “What, Re? To be fair, your party trick’s better. Fancy showing Moony off?”
 
  “Are you serious?” Remus exclaimed, looking mildly horrified while Sirius just laughed, “No!” 
 
  Harry held up a hand before Sirius could get a word in. “No werewolves and no name jokes either, please!” he exclaimed, glancing playfully at his Godfather. 
 
  “Shame,” Sirius settled his long hair roughly back into place then put a placating hand on Remus’ thigh, “because 
  
    that 
  
  transformation really is cool. Ah well, never mind, I’ll see Moony in a few days I suppose. Let’s go to bed instead, then shall we?” 

  
  
  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    
  The bed in the room that Remus and Sirius had set up for the three of them to sleep in was enormous. Hermione actually had to jump slightly to perch her bottom on the edge of the mattress. “Want a lift?” Draco asked, not bothering to hide his amusement. 
 
  Hermione laughed as she shook her head. “We’re not all as tall as you are. Besides, I managed just fine, thank you,” she replied with as much dignity as she could muster.
 
  “That you did,” Draco smirked, crossed to the window, started to close the heavy curtains, then paused. “I still find it strange that this house is invisible to most people from the square, yet we’re in here, and we can see everything outside just fine.”
 
  “Yep,” Hermione agreed, nestling her hands into the soft, downy bedding. “We’ve all been let into the Fidelius charm so we can see the house from the outside. Not that it matters these days, but it used to. We used to sit downstairs in the lounge, staring out of the window, watching for Death Eaters when we were hiding out here during the war. There was always a guard outside, watching and waiting in case we slipped up or missed the step when we apparated in or out.”
 
  “I know.” Draco sighed and rubbed a hand over his face looking regretful. “I was often one of those guards. I’ve spent longer than I’d care to admit hanging around this square under a stupid mask. Believe me, none of us could see this house in the slightest. I had come here as a child a few times before Walburga died, and even then, I couldn’t see it. The charm works perfectly. I saw you and the others apparate in and out a few times, though. So did my father and a couple of the other supposed guards. You weren’t always as careful as you thought you were.” Hermione’s eyes widened as Draco resolutely tugged the curtain shut. “I honestly never imagined I’d end up inside here with you, certainly not sleeping beside you in the guest bedroom!”
 
  Draco pulled his jumper over his head as he stepped towards her. The move left him in just a t-shirt, and his Dark Mark stood out eerily against his pale skin in the dim candlelight. Hermione’s brain finally caught up with his words as she watched the mark appear to shimmer and move. If Draco, Lucius, and some of the others had seen them apparate during the war, then they’d been in the perfect position to stun and capture them, yet none of them had ever even tried. “What?” Draco asked gently, following her eyes and flinching slightly but resolutely refusing to hide his arm away. 
 
  “Nothing.” Hermione pulled her top over her head. She refused to ask for more details because she didn’t want to know. That part of her life was now in the past, and she didn’t want to venture back into painful memories just now. “Well, maybe it is a little something,” she countered, seeing Draco’s confusion. “I’ve decided it’s time to stop hiding my arm scars away, and seeing your Dark Mark just reminded me of that decision.” She tried to keep her voice light, but Draco seemed to understand the gravity her words held instinctively.
 
  He nodded and stepped closer to her. She opened her knees to let him in, then wrapped her arms around him, laying her cheek against his chest and listening to his steady, soothing heartbeat. “I love you,” he whispered softly, “and I’m proud of you for deciding to do that. It sounds easier than it is sometimes, though, that’s all I’ll say. Be gentle on yourself.”
 
  She nodded. “Thank you. I’ll try to be. I love you too.”

   

  “Are you still feeling poorly?” Draco asked, stroking her hair and dropping a kiss onto the top of her head. She shook her head. Ironically, she felt better now than she had all day. “Good,” he smiled, “because we’ve got plans for you tonight.”

   

  “Oh?” Hermione tipped her head back and giggled at his devilish smirk. 

   

  “Oh, yes,” he confirmed. “If Theo ever gets his arse up here, that is. I knew we shouldn’t have left him downstairs with Sirius. I swear he’d stay up all night and sleep all day given the chance.”

   

  Hermione laughed. “I think Sirius is similar, according to Remus, so we could potentially be waiting a while. Shall we go get him?”

   

  Draco rolled his eyes. “Send your otter down, love, tell him we need him up here, say something dirty and I bet he’ll be up before we can blink!” Draco handed her his wand then crossed to the bathroom with a smile. “Ask him to bring your wand up too, you left it on the table. I meant to grab it, then I forgot.” Hermione stared down at Draco’s wand with a slight frown and rather apprehensively weighed up it’s balance in her hand. Summoning a happy memory she cast her patronus into the bedroom almost as easily as usual, spoke to it quietly, then sent it away with a whoosh.

   

  “Did you tell him we were both naked and tied to the bed?” Draco asked, slurring his words through a mouthful of toothpaste.
 
  “Not quite,” she laughed, tensing her thighs as a shiver of interest made her whole body quiver, “I just told him we were going to bed and asked him to bring my wand up.”
 
  Draco frowned, turning away to spit into the sink. “That doesn't sound quite as exciting.”
 
  “But, apparently, it’s just as effective,” Hermione grinned in triumph as Theo apparated directly into the room.
 
  “You called?” he grinned as he ran a hand through his disheveled hair. Hermione felt her pulse quicken in response. He looked absolutely gorgeous, as always.
 
  “Yes,” she said boldly. “I did. Apparently, you and Draco have plans.”
 
  “Do we?” Theo blinked in surprise, then smiled as she hopped down from the bed to kiss him brazenly. “Oh. Those plans.” His eyes visibly darkened at her slow nod. He brushed his lips over hers then deepened the kiss, pulling her in and tangling his fingers into her hair. “Sorry,” he murmured, biting her bottom lip gently, “I should probably brush my teeth too. We’ve been drinking wine, and-” she cut him off with another kiss. She knew what he’d been up to. She could taste the Merlot and the smoke on him, but she didn’t care. She just pressed herself wantonly against him as desire flared like an inferno inside her. 
 
  “Some people find,” Theo said when he finally pulled back, leaving her panting and full of barely restrained desire, “that their bodies are more aroused and sensitive following a hangover.”
 
  “Do they?” she asked, grinning as she happily played along.
 “Mhmm. They do.” Theo’s smirk grew even more wicked as Draco emerged from the bathroom. “And since I suspect that you might be one of them, here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to vanish your clothes wandlessly,” he snapped his fingers and Hermione whimpered as her clothes magically disappeared, “just like that. Then because I know you like power shows and mind magic, I’m going to wandlessly levitate you onto the bed and tell Draco to get you off while I use the bathroom. And if you do turn out to be one of those people who feel extra sensitive following a hangover, then you’ll come harder than you ever have. In fact,” he grinned wickedly as she mewled quietly in response to his words, “tonight, I want to see if you can squirt all over Draco’s hand.”  
  With a gasp followed by a squeal, Hermione found herself laying flat on her back, naked, in the middle of the enormous bed. Draco smirked as he dropped the rest of his own clothes to the floor and hopped up beside her. “Hi,” he said, as she turned to look at him, “how does all that sound?”
 
  “Perfect,” she breathed, already shivering with anticipation. 
 
  “Have you ever squirted before?” She shook her head, wondering if such a thing was even truly possible and resolving to ask Ginny or Pansy about it the next day. “Let’s see what we can do then, shall we?”At her wanton moan of encouragement, Draco kissed her gently then picked up the pace until he was plundering her mouth with his tongue. He moved across the bed to straddle her, and she pulled him closer, feeling her skin heat instantly as it came into contact with his. Draco stroked his hand down her side. She quivered as he cupped her breasts, wriggling his way down the bed, peppering kisses across her chest, and then sucking one of her already throbbing nipples into his mouth.
 
  Hermione sighed with pleasure and turned her head to see Theo watching them from the bathroom doorway. His toothbrush paused as she caught his eye, and an idea popped into her mind. She gathered her thoughts into as strong a statement as she could, stared deeply into his blue eyes, then concentrated on pushing the image forcefully into his mind. “I want to watch you two together.”
 
  Theo staggered slightly. Hermione’s surprised giggle morphed into a moan as Draco also jumped and nipped her nipple significantly harder than usual with his teeth. Theo nodded, then backed into the bathroom, apparently remembering he was halfway through brushing his teeth. “Do you, now?” Draco drawled, his voice laced with amusement. 
 
  “Umm, yes.” She could feel her cheeks heating. Maybe she had overdone things a little. “You heard that too?”
 
  Draco chuckled. “Darling, I think Sirius and Remus probably heard that downstairs. I don’t normally hear other people’s thoughts unless I consciously tune in to them, but you just projected that one quite loudly!”
 
  “Oh!” she giggled. “I didn’t know how strongly I had to- ooooh- do- ahhhh- it!”
 
  “Normal thinking volume will do it for Theo,” Draco said, resuming his leisurely ministrations, “he hears everything unless he’s consciously blocking it out. I think an hour in his head would feel rather overwhelming.”
 
  “Tell us what you want to see then, sweetheart,” Theo said, unzipping his hoodie as he joined them on the bed. 
 
  “Just you- ah- and Draco- mmm- togeth- ohhh, amnnmmph!” she abandoned speech altogether as Draco’s hand dipped lower. He stroked his thumb over her clit, parted her already slick folds, and slid a finger smoothly inside. 
 
  “Since you seem to be rendered speechless at the moment, shall I hazard a guess?” Theo asked, and she nodded helplessly. Her orgasm was building fast. The bundle of nerves Draco was stroking was causing a pulsing heat to build inside her to almost painful levels. She whimpered, tensing as her climax built, but just as she was about to come, Draco stilled his hand. She bucked against his fingers, but he just watched her closely as Theo trailed his hand over her nipples.
 
  “Have you ever watched two men fuck before?” Theo asked. She shook her head, still writhing underneath Draco, who stubbornly refused to move. “But you want to?” Theo continued. Her eyes rolled back at the mere thought, and she jolted again as Draco brushed his thumb against her now overly sensitive clit.
 
  “What? Yes!”
 
  “Good girl. Draco likes it best when I take him from behind. We’re going to do it over the top of you tonight. That way you can kiss him and swallow his moans to keep him quiet. You can take his cock in your hand while I fuck him, you can stroke him if you like, or you can line him up and slide him inside your hot, dripping-”
 
  Hermione cut him off with a squeal. As Theo had begun to speak, Draco had resumed the steady pumping of his fingers. Perfectly timed with Theo’s words, Draco pressed down onto her G spot and flicked his thumb over her clit, causing her to buck up against him. “Shhh,” Theo moved his hand to cover her mouth, and the feeling excited her even further. She bit her lip, gasping for breath around his fingers. “Remember your safeword,” Theo breathed, then moved his hand and closed it gently around her throat. Two more strokes from Draco’s fingers, and she detonated under his touch. Theo’s hand squeezed gently, then more threateningly, and the strength of her climax instantly doubled. 
 
  As she calmed, Draco withdrew his fingers and gazed down at her in wonder as Theo removed his hand from her neck. “What is it about that move?” Draco asked, switching his incredulous gaze across to Theo.
 
  Theo just chuckled, “It’s the vulnerability it makes you feel. It gets you every time too, doesn’t it?” Draco nodded as Hermione slowly floated back down to earth. “Did she squirt?”
 
  “Not that time, but I think she can. She felt like she was close. She just needs to let go a little more. Does it do anything for you?” Draco asked, stroking Hermione’s hair away from her damp face and running his hand over her throat himself.
 
  “Yeah. It makes me panic,” Theo admitted as Hermione slowly regained her senses. “And try to punch Adrian Pucey in the face.” Hermione giggled while Theo rolled his eyes, “which seemed a little unfair since he’d asked if he could try it beforehand and I’d said yes. That was the night we came to realize that I’m not the submissive type. Since he wasn’t either, we called it a day lest we accidentally killed each other.”
 
  Draco laughed, and Hermione reached up to push a lock of Theo’s dark hair out of his face. “You’ve submitted to me,” Draco argued.
 
  “Partially,” Theo shrugged. “And you’re the only person I’ve ever let go that far. I trust you. Both of you, it’s just not the way I am. Anyway, neither of you seem to mind that too much.
 
  “I don’t mind it at all, in fact, you know I love it.” Draco rolled over to stare at the ceiling. “What we have between us is perfect. I know you’ll take care of me.”
 
  Theo’s smile was slow, and his nod soft. “That I will. Come here, switch places, both of you.”
 
  Hermione gathered her now boneless body with some difficulty and let Draco climb over the top of her. She wanted to ask more. Theo had hinted several times that there was a reason he didn’t like to be held down or tied up, but now didn’t seem like the best time to ask him about it. Instead, she settled herself against the plush headboard and inhaled sharply as she watched him kiss Draco. 
 
  They looked like they’d been together as a couple for years, which she supposed, in a way they had. They responded to each other perfectly, each knowing the other’s responses instinctively. Theo led, and Draco followed. It was beautiful to watch. 
 
  Hermione's breathing quickened as the kisses between the two men became heated. Draco brushed his lips down Theo’s neck, finding the sensitive spot just under his earlobe and nipping to make him throw his head back and moan. In return, Theo dropped his hand,  running it down Draco’s side, all the way to his hip, then brushed the back of his fingers along the length of his straining cock. 
 
  Theo kissed his way along Draco’s body, pausing to tongue both of his nipples, making him thrash his head from side to side on the pillow. Theo continued his slow, lazy journey until he reached Draco’s belly button. He paused to caress it with his fingers, then took both of Draco’s hands in his, stretched his arms up above his head, and stuck them in place on the pillow with a charm. 
 
  Draco groaned, tugging in vain against the invisible restraints. He lifted his hips, inviting Theo in, but Theo just swatted his thigh and moved back up to his nipples instead. “Patience, sweetheart,” Theo said, slowly laving kisses all the way back down. This time Draco held still, although Hermione could see the effort that cost him. Theo rewarded him with a kiss to each of his thighs, then sucked his hard length smoothly into his mouth. Hermione locked eyes with Theo as he pulled back, licked his lips, and sank all the way down until his nose was buried in Draco’s soft, blonde curls. Hermione’s eyes widened. She still had no idea how he could physically do that. He stayed still with his cheeks hollowed for an impossibly long time, Draco’s eyes rolled back in his head before Theo pulled off, gasped a breath, then repeated the move several more times. 
 
  Hermione whimpered as Theo finally pulled back slowly and let Draco spring gently free. Theo whispered a charm to release Draco’s hands, and Draco immediately wrapped his arms around him, pulling him in closer. “Turn over,” Theo whispered, and Draco flipped over onto his front. “You alright?” Hermione jumped a little, startled, realizing that Theo was speaking to her. She nodded as he flipped her knees open with his hands. “You want to watch or join in?”
 
  Theo grinned as she stared at him wordlessly. He took her hand and guided it down to her own wet heat. “Show us how you get yourself off then,” he said, lifting a brow and stroking a hand over Draco's back. “Let me see those pretty fingers of yours disappear into your hot, tight little cunt.” Theo guided Draco into the position he wanted, then caressed the smooth skin of his bottom with his hand. He muttered a cleaning and lubrication spell, then parted Draco’s cheeks and stroked a finger gently across his entrance. 
 
  At Theo’s touch, Draco tensed then pushed back onto Theo’s hand, looking for more contact. Theo repeated the move, and Hermione shamelessly moved along the headboard to get a better view. She saw the tension in Draco’s thighs, the anticipation on his face, then his gasp of relief as Theo’s finger finally breached his tight ring of muscle. Theo paused for a moment, closing his eyes and waiting for Draco to adjust before sliding his finger deeper inside. Draco mumbled something incoherent, and Theo moaned in response as he started to gently slide his finger in and out. Draco reached out for Hermione, tugged her close to him, and kissed her heatedly. 
 
  When Draco released her, she moved back to watch once again. She gasped as Theo added a second finger to the first, twisting and moving them slowly for a few long moments before carefully adding one more. By now, Draco was panting. He’d dropped his head into the pillow and was rocking back and forth, impaling then releasing himself on Theo’s fingers over and over again. “Hold still,” Theo whispered, then withdrew his hand completely. He reached around, grasped and then pumped Draco’s cock a few times then moved his attention back to Hermione. “Ask him if he’s ready for me to fuck him?” Theo commanded, vanishing his own clothes, as Draco almost collapsed onto the bed hearing Hermione repeat the question word for word. 
 
  “Yes,” Draco gasped, sounding pained as Theo composed himself then lined himself up. 
 
  “Relax then, darling,” Theo stroked him softly then pressed the tip of his cock into position. He entered Draco slowly, each shallow thrust much more gentle and measured than when he did the same thing to Hermione. She held her breath as she watched him close his eyes and sink all the way inside. Draco cried out as Theo’s final gentle nudge buried him to the hilt. “You okay?” he asked, sounding strained.
 
  Draco nodded breathlessly as Theo started to move. “You?” Draco asked, and Theo nodded.
 
  “Of course I am. It’s you isn’t it?” he gasped. “I fucking love you, Draco.” 
 
  Draco smiled. “I… love… you too!” he gasped, taking hold of Hermione’s arm and tugging her towards them both. 
 
  She ended up underneath Draco, looking up into his glazed over eyes as Theo increased both the weight and the speed of his thrusts. “Gods, Draco, so tight, so good,” Theo’s eyes were closed as he lost himself completely in Draco. “I’m not gonna last- been too long, I’m gonna- I can’t.” Draco kissed Hermione frantically, and she felt her own climax building at the sight and feel of what was going on around her. 
 
  Theo reached around and guided her hand onto Draco’s cock, it was rock hard, and Theo’s vigorous thrusting caused it to pump in and out of her hand. “Fuck her, Draco,” he whispered, slowing his pace and looking pained, “I’ve always wanted to try this.”
 
  Carefully, almost desperately, Hermione positioned herself, and Draco lined himself up while Theo paused until she nodded. “Now.”
 
  One thrust from Theo buried Draco all the way inside her. Draco moaned, kissing her as if he was trying to devour her. Theo snapped his hips, pushing Draco impossibly deep into her and she cried out as she lifted her hips to meet him. “Come. Hermione. Now!” Theo demanded, and she felt Draco stiffen inside her
 
  “Fuck!” Draco gasped, burying his face into her neck as he thrusted erratically into her, “mmmm!” Theo followed him a split second later, and as he pushed Draco forwards, Hermione's own climax tore through her, washing over her in pulses of white hot, molten heat. It was the most intense orgasm she had ever experienced. She closed her eyes and stars burst behind the dark of her eyelids. Her whole body was on fire. She was surrounded, trapped, and completely unable to move. 
 
  Theo continued to thrust gently, and every move he made traveled through Draco and into her, pushing her orgasm to even greater heights. When Theo stilled, he dropped lifelessly down onto Draco who braced himself to avoid completely crushing Hermione beneath him. “Oh. My. Gods!” Draco lifted his head then let out a long satisfied breath. “Sweet Merlin, that was amazing. Are you alright under there?” he asked, apparently realising that despite his efforts, both he and Theo had semi collapsed on top of her.
 
  “Can’t breathe,” she gasped and Draco lifted himself up, patting Theo on the arm. 
 
  “You alright, babes?” he asked.
 
  “Yep. Just a minute, let me,” Theo pulled a face as extracted himself from Draco then collapsed down onto the bed, still breathing hard. 
 
  “Sorry,” Draco grinned sheepishly as he in turn released himself from Hermione, “you really just wanted to watch, didn’t you?”
 
  Hermione laughed as her body finally recovered from her monumental climax. “I think I preferred it this way.”
 
  “I’ve always wanted to try that,” Theo shook his head in wonder. “And it was truly amazing. As sex with you two always is.”
 
  “Same,” Draco kissed Theo on the nose, turned over then did the same to Hermione. “Just out of interest, could we try that with you in the middle sometime? No pressure if you're not comfortable with it, though?”
 
  Theo took a long time to answer. He stared up at the ceiling then down at the bedding. “Maybe,” he said eventually and Draco nodded, reaching out across Hermione to take his hand. Hermione couldn’t help wondering if there was something she was still missing, but her sated and fuzzy brian was too sleepy to ask any questions at that moment. 
 
  “Cool,” Draco mumbled, settling himself down comfortably. “Now, go to sleep both of you. I’ve got to check on the wolfsbane in two hours!”
 
  
  

  The next morning Hermione kissed Sirius and Remus goodbye, then followed Theo and Draco back through the floo into the deserted eighth year common room. Checking her watch, she rolled her eyes then hurried into the Gryffindor girl’s dorms. She was almost late already. She just about had time to grab her scattered books and quills, then she’d have to run if she wanted to make it to Charms on time. 
 
  She yanked her rarely used bed hangings back and stopped short, frowning in confusion at the sight in front of her. Laid out across her bed were several black and white magical photographs. She picked up the first picture and gasped as the bottom abruptly fell out of her stomach. The whole world seemed to come to a screeching, grinding halt as she stared in abject horror at the picture in her hands. “No!” she cried, gasping for air and sinking blindly down onto the bed to look frantically through the other photographs, “no way! He wouldn’t!”
 
  A shocked sob rose painfully in her throat as she stared again at the moving photograph in her hand. It showed Theo holding a pretty blond girl in his arms, looking deeply into her eyes, and then leaning in to kiss her passionately. The other photographs all showed similar scenes. Theo and the mystery girl laughing together, holding hands and playing about in the autumn leaves the same way Hermione herself had done with Theo and Draco way back when the game had first started, and they had walked into Hogsmeade together. The backdrop to the shots appeared to be the footpath into Hogsmeade. One of the photographs showed the ‘Welcome to Hogsmeade’ sign illuminated with Christmas fairy lights, and the Shrieking Shack was just about visible in the distance.
 
  Tears started to fall unchecked down Hermione’s face, and her hands shook uncontrollably as she flicked through the pictures. She picked up a previously unseen handwritten note and frowned at the untidy scrawling letters. ‘Just thought you should know what he’s really like.’ From Hermione’s memory, the writing on this piece of parchment was identical to that on the previous notes. 
 
  Hermione heard the bell ring for the start of class, but she didn’t care. She couldn’t care. She stared, her whole body shaking with sobs, feeling completely and utterly betrayed. She found it difficult to breathe. Her throat was constricted and her chest felt as though it was filled with a lead weight. She wanted to scream, to rage, and to lash out. She wanted to run far, far away from these devastating pictures, but most of all, she wanted access to the time turner she’d used in her third year. She’d keep flipping it over and over if it meant never having to see these heartbreaking photographs again. 
 
  How was it possible, she wondered, that she had fallen so totally in love with someone that she’d been with for such a short amount of time? It wasn’t just Theo though. She knew that if Draco was the one in the pictures she would have felt exactly the same. She was incredulous. Had everything Theo ever told her been a lie? She didn’t want to believe it. She wouldn’t believe it. Surely, there had to be some kind of mistake. Theo wouldn’t do this to her and Draco. Would he?
 
  A surge of hope rushed through her as her desperate brain clutched wildly at straws. Was it possible that these were old pictures, taken this time last year? The Christmas lights and the late autumn weather would have been the same, after all. But, as she stared, even that vague glimmer of hope was dashed. One of the photos clearly showed Theo’s snake tattoo, and he’d already told her that he’d had that done in Italy, back in the spring of this current year. 
 
  No. The photos had clearly been taken very recently.  
 
  The longer Hermione stared at the pictures, the worse she felt. Her mind was replaying what felt like her, Draco, and Theo’s entire relationship. She remembered every little detail, the way the light glinted on Theo’s untidy hair, the way he smiled and laughed, the way he looked so deeply into her eyes that it felt as if he was seeing her soul. Then she thought of the way he looked at Draco and the easy familiarity they both shared. They were so comfortable together. She’d witnessed the extent of that just last night. There was more than familiarity between the two of them. There was love. The same love that Theo professed to feel for her, and yet, here she was, looking at irrefutable proof that that was all a lie.
 
  But was it irrefutable proof though?
 
  Something, apart from the obvious, was starting to feel wrong. As the first waves of shock and utter disbelief started to clear, Hermione’s brain clicked up a gear. She might not have been with Theo for that long, but she felt she knew him pretty well. Theo was many things, but in her opinion, he wasn’t a liar, nor was he a cheat. 
 
  Hermione took a deep, shaky breath and wiped her eyes as reason and logic started to creep back in. Her brain spun. The more she thought about it, the more her ability to date and place the pictures so easily ate away at her. It was too easy. The pictures seemed too specifically revealing. Why would Theo have bare arms in Hogsmeade in December? Was it possible that someone was trying to deliberately date the photos by using his tattoos and the fairy lights?
 
  Two possibilities spun around in her mind, the first, most obvious one being that Theo really was a liar, but despite the apparent evidence in her hand, that idea just felt wrong, and two, that it wasn’t really him in the pictures.
 
  Hermione’s eyes widened as she remembered just how easy it was to impersonate somebody else in the magical world. Barty Crouch had pulled the feat off undetected for almost an entire school year. It wasn’t completely impossible that somebody was using Polyjuice Potion here as well. She gasped as her mind spun with possibilities. Her eyes widened and she dropped the photo as an uncomfortable memory hit her like a tonne of bricks. Daphne and Theo, giggling as they’d emerged from the Herbology greenhouses a few weeks ago. Theo’s hair had been full of Devil’s Snare leaves and Daphne had been pulling them out. “Polyjuice,” Hermione breathed. “Bloody Polyjuice Potion! But why?”
 
  Determined to prove a theory that had been building in her mind for weeks, she rifled through her bedside drawers and pulled out the older notes. The writing on each sheet of 
  parchment matched perfectly. Searching around further in the drawer, she found the other things she was looking for. Each year every Hogwarts house had a whole house photograph taken, and rather helpfully, this year’s ones had only recently come out. Hermione picked all four pictures out of her drawer, brushed aside the Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff photos, and focused instead on the Slytherin one. 
 
  Finally, she found what she was looking for. She skimmed past their own year group, past Draco, Theo, Blaise, Pansy, and the others, and moved on down to the younger year groups. “Gotcha,” she whispered, giving a huge sigh of relief. Standing in the middle of one row was the unidentified blonde girl who Theo had apparently been holding so reverently in his arms. “Hannah Fawley,” Hermione read her name then wrinkled her nose as she scanned the line of smiling students. Standing next to Hannah was none other than Astoria Greengrass. 
 
  Hermione wiped her final tears away and stared furiously around her bed space. “Dobby! Kreacher!” she called, and two loud cracks announced the arrival of the tiny house elves, both of whom fell over each other in an attempt to answer her first. “You called Miss?” Dobby squeaked as both he and Kreacher bowed deeply. 
 
  “I did. Thank you for coming. Please,” she said uncomfortably, “there’s no need to bow, you know me. Did you both manage to do as I asked? Have you been tailing the Greengrass sisters and Tracy Davis?”
 
  “Yes, Mistress Hermione!!” Dobby squeaked, but he was cut off by Kreacher’s bullfrog croak.
 
  “Yes. Kreacher has been doing just that. Kreacher has been following very discreetly and Kreacher has seen things. Kreacher has some very important news.”
 
  “So does Dobby, Miss Hermione!” Dobby dove in front of Kreacher and almost landed in Hermione’s lap in his haste to tell his side of the story. “Dobby has also been spying on them and Dobby has news too!”
 
  “Alright,” Hermione nodded grimly. “Thank you both very much.” she patted the bed beside her gently. “Please sit down then, both of you, and tell me everything you’ve found out.” 

  
    Chapter Text
    
  By the time Kreacher and Dobby had finished speaking, Hermione was shaking. Whether that was from rage, sorrow, or even sympathy, she wasn’t sure, but she knew one thing for certain; It wasn’t Theo in the pictures, and he hadn’t cheated on her and Draco. 
 
  “Would Miss Hermione like Dobby to fetch her a glass of water?” The tiny elf asked as Kreacher conjured a rather grimy looking handkerchief from a crumpled piece of parchment that had been left lying on the bed.
 
  “Yes, please, Dobby. Thank you.” Hermione eyed the grey material suspiciously then blew her nose on it anyway. “And thank you Kreacher. Where are the girls now?” she asked once Dobby had disappeared with a resounding crack.
 
  “Miss Daphne and Miss Tracy are in their Charms class, and Miss Astoria is in her Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson,” Kreacher confirmed. Hermione gasped, she had forgotten that she was supposed to be in Charms. Since she was likely to be the only one who hadn’t made it to class, her absence was going to be rather noticeable, especially given her usual perfect attendance track record. All things considered, it was a miracle that Theo, Draco, and possibly Harry and Ron hadn’t already come looking for her.
 
  “Thank you, Dobby.” Hermione took the glass from the tiny elf as he reappeared. 
 
  “Would Miss Hermione like Dobby to do anything else?” he asked, looking rather hopeful. “Only Dobby knows a few good curses, nothing too terrible, Miss Hermione understands, Dobby would never use anything that would endanger life, but Dobby could, maybe just maim the people who have hurt Miss Hermione slight-”
 
  “No! Thank you, Dobby, that won’t be necessary!” Hermione gasped, spluttering on her drink in alarm. “I can take it from here. Although, there is one more thing you could do for me, in a few minutes you could come with me to Grimmauld Place, just in case I need help retelling the details of the story. That is if you don't mind, of course?”
 
  Both Dobby and Kreacher bowed so low that their noses almost touched the scuffed wooden floor. “It would be an honor Miss Hermione,” Dobby squeaked. 
 
   “Wait here then, please,” Hermione smiled, then turned and hurried away into the Gryffindor boys dormitories. Horrified by how little time was left until the end of class, she stared hesitantly at Harry’s untidy trunk, hoping that he would forgive her for what she was about to do. 
 
  No matter how she imagined telling any of the boys what had happened, she could only imagine the conversation ending one way, and that was in complete and utter pandemonium. Hermione had listened to the elves' tales, and she had been thoroughly shocked by what she had heard. No matter what dirty, underhanded tricks the girls had pulled, according to both Dobby and Kreacher, they actually 
  
    did
  
   have a reason for acting the way they had. While Hermione could never condone the disgraceful tactics they had used when they could have just been honest about the situation and asked for help directly, she did understand how it felt to be utterly desperate about a problem, and how sometimes it seemed that the only option was to resort to rash measures in an attempt to solve it. 
 
  She took a deep breath as she made up her mind. She didn’t endorse Daphne or Astoria’s actions in any way, and she was having an even harder time understanding Tracy’s motives for being involved in the whole unpleasant situation, but, she reminded herself, she hadn’t kept her moral compass intact all through a hard fought war, only to lose it now. If she was able to help the girls solve their problem, then that was what she was going to do. She just needed to stop Theo and Draco from running off to confront Daphne and Tracy, and then convince the boys to help her. 
 
  Theo and Draco would likely know that something was wrong the moment they saw her. Given both of her boyfriend’s prodigious mind reading skills, she knew that her only chance of getting them to Grimmauld Place, which was where she wanted to tell them what had happened, was if they couldn’t see her.
 
  Hermione whispered the old password to Harry’s trunk security wards and rolled her eyes when it worked, and she realized that he hadn’t changed it since the previous summer. “Accio Invisibility cloak,” she called, and the bundle of shimmery, silver material flew into her hand. Frowning, Hermione shook off several week’s worth of crumbs, a handful of dirty socks, what looked suspiciously like a pair of Pansy’s knickers, and an empty chocolate frog wrapper. 
 
  Knowing that it was entirely pointless to tell Harry off for his untidiness, some things never changed, after all, she pulled the cloak on, fastened it around herself, then hurried off to the Charms classroom.
 
   Standing invisible in the corridor, waiting for the bell to ring, was one of the most nerve wracking things Hermione had done in a long while. She hoped that given the circumstances, Harry would forgive her for borrowing the cloak. She'd never usually go through his things without asking, but she figured that desperate times called for desperate measures. 
 
  Eventually, the bell chimed, and the classroom door flew open, crashing into the castle wall with a loud bang. Hermione was almost flattened in the rush. Theo and Draco were first out of the door, followed by Harry, Ron, Pansy, Blaise, Ginny, Greg, Dean, Seamus, Neville, Millie, Hannah, Lavender, Parvati, and Luna all of whom hurried off up the corridor at top speed, clearly looking for her, and ignoring Professor Flitwick’s squeaky shouts for them to slow down and stop acting like stampeding erumpents. 
 
  Hermione winced as they all rushed past her. Theo blasted a spell at a group of third years who were blocking the corridor up ahead, and they all skittered out of the way in alarm, glaring at him reproachfully as he passed. 
 
  Hannah and Luna briefly stopped to make sure the boy who had tripped in the process of moving so abruptly was okay, then even they dashed off down the corridor leaving Hermione standing under the clock with an incredulous smile on her lips and her heart full of the warmth that having such a caring group of friends brought. 
 
  Never in her life had she had friendships like these. What amazed her still further was who their large but tightly knitted new group consisted of, but it seemed that on the inside, Gryffindors and Slytherins weren't so different after all.  
 
  Ten minutes later, when every single one of her friends had barreled through the floo and into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, Hermione was still feeling very loved. “Oh Gods!” she blushed, clapping her hands over her mouth as a bemused Sirius wandered into the kitchen, looking thoroughly disheveled and only half dressed. 
 
  “You just put that on inside out,” Hermione heard Harry hiss to his Godfather. Sirius just smirked, peeled his t-shirt off, and turned it the right way out without bothering to leave the room, while Remus hurried down the stairs, looking equally unkempt and still doing up the buttons on his jeans. “And, that’s not even your t-shirt!” Harry continued with a pained wince.
 
  Sirius just grinned as he carded his fingers through his hair. “I like wearing Remus’ clothes, they smell of him. Anyway, we didn’t know we were expecting quite so many visitors on our morning off,” he said, winking at Pansy, who had been openly ogling his bare chest. “We were otherwise engaged. What the hell’s going on here, Harry?”
 
  Hermione, who was still hiding under the cloak, heard Harry sigh. “We’ve got a free period,” he said, “and something’s going on with Hermione. She missed class, which is unheard of, then she was waiting for us outside the door wearing the invisibility cloak and when she’d caught us all up she said we needed to talk about something serious.”
 
  “
  
    All
  
   of you needed to talk?” Sirius clarified, looking around the crowded kitchen, “as in, your entire year group?”
 
  Hermione emerged from underneath the cloak just as Dobby and Kreacher apparated into the kitchen. “I’m so sorry, Sirius,” she said, wringing her hands desperately, “I’m also really sorry if we umm,” she blushed, “disturbed you. It’s just that this is really important. Something’s happened, and I asked Theo and Draco, and then Harry, Ron, and Ginny to come with me, but Pansy, Millie, and Blaise were with them, and well, things kind of escalated from there, and this was, well, this was what happened. We’ve got a free period though so it’s not quite as terrible as it seems!”
 
  “Trust you to worry about that. You're clearly a popular girl, Kitten.” Sirius nodded. “What’s happened, though?” his grey eyes flashed in alarm at the grimly determined look on Hermione’s face as she waved her wand and magically blocked the floo. “Uhh, Kitten? You're locking us in. Seriously now, you're worrying me. What’s happened?”
 
  “I’m only locking the floo for a moment, I just don’t want anyone marching back through it in a temper just yet,” she said, taking a deep breath and eyeing Theo in particular. She took another deep, steadying breath. It was now or never. “All right, everyone,” she called, “listen up! I found something on my bed when I went back to the Gryffindor girls dorms to get my things for class this morning. It threw me for a bit, I’ll admit, but it’s also a good thing because I now know who was behind the notes. All of them.” She locked eyes with Hannah, who looked startled, and avoided Draco and Theo’s gaze altogether. These photos were left on my bed,” she said, holding them face down against her chest, “along with this note. Don’t worry, Theo, I 
  
    know
  
   it’s not you in the pictures. I’ve had my suspicions for a while about who was behind these notes, so a week or so ago I asked Dobby and Kreacher to do some investigating for me. And they did brilliantly. They found out everything. I know who’s done this, and I know why they’ve done it. I’m not saying that their reasoning makes any of it right, but I want you all to hear me out before you go rushing off to do anything hasty, please.”
 
  Hermione looked up and jolted to see everyone in the room staring at her with varying degrees of concern, and the two elves looking at her with pride filled eyes. “Theo? Can I show these to you privately for a moment?” Theo nodded sharply as he crossed the room. “I promise I know this isn’t you in the pictures.” She braced herself as he took the photographs from her and stared at them in shock.
 
  “What, the actual FUCK is this all this?” he exclaimed as Draco stepped up beside him. “That’s not, I mean, that isn’t- that’s not ME!”
 
  “I know it’s not.” Hermione put a hand on his arm as Draco caught sight of the photograph then yanked it out of Theo’s hand, looking just as horrified as Hermione had felt earlier in the morning. “I 
  
    know 
  
  it’s not you!” she said again. 
 
  Theo said nothing as he passed the photographs to Blaise, and even his trademark unreadable expression faltered into outright dismay. 
 
  A full five minutes later, as Hermione had predicted, the room was in absolute pandemonium. It was only when Seamus finally passed the incriminating photographs back to Hermione, and Ginny stuck two fingers in her mouth to give an ear splitting whistle that Hermione managed to make herself heard once more. “Let me explain what the elves have found out,” she said, watching Kreacher and Dobby throw their chests out proudly. 
 
  “The girl in these pictures is called Hannah Fawley, and she just happens to be Astoria Greengrass’ best friend. Astoria, Daphne, and Tracy Davis are the ones behind the notes. They’ve been trying to split us up since we first got together, and this is their last ditch attempt to do so. They’ve used polyjuice potion here to trick us, and Theo, I’m sure that Daphne pushed you into the devil’s snare bush that day in herbology so that she could gather your hair for use in the potio-”
 
  “It wasn’t Daph who pushed me over,” Theo began, looking highly confused, “Neville stumbled into me, and I was off balance anywa-”
 
  “Theo,” Neville said quietly, and everyone in the room turned to look at him, “I stumbled because Daphne pushed me into you. It was bizarre, actually, though I didn’t question it too much at the time. She just came up to me, shoved me into you, then ran off. It makes perfect sense now though.”
 
  Theo just stared at Neville with his mouth slightly open. “But why?” he turned back to Hermione, looking both utterly amazed and extremely hurt. “I don’t understand. All three of those girls are lifelong friends of myself and Draco. Why would they do this to us?”
 
  “Because,” Hermione said grimly, “The Greengrass family is affected by a blood curse, and Astoria is the latest person to have inherited it. The family believes that the curse will activate when Astoria comes of age. Her seventeenth birthday is on New Year’s Eve, and so she has three weeks left before the curse activates. Once the curse activates, it is supposedly impossible to break. Before she turns seventeen, though, it can be broken by a genuine marriage proposal from the heir of a family who is a member of the sacred twenty eight.” Hermione bit her lip then stared down at the floor. “ It’s an ancient, twisted way of ensuring the family only marries purebloods. To put it bluntly, to break this curse, Astoria needs to get engaged to Draco, Theo, or Greg before New Year’s Eve. This is why Daphne entered the game but left as soon as she wasn’t paired up with one of the three of you. She came to the further game meetings as a way of gathering information that she could use against you all. They’ve been trying to entice you away or to break us up ever since we got together because they are desperately trying to save Astoria’s life.”
 
  “Is this a good time to ask why they never targeted us then?” Millie asked, sounding nervous, “Only the Weasley’s are a sacred twenty eight family too.”
 
  “Yes, but Ron’s not the Weasley heir,” Sirius explained. “The heir is traditionally the eldest son, which would be Bill.”
 
  A long silence greeted these words. “And Tracy?” Pansy asked with a grim scowl, “Why is she involved in all of this?”
 
  “Because she’s Daphne’s best friend, and also because Theo broke her heart,” Hermione said sadly. “Tracy was more hurt by Theo leaving her than she let on.” Hermione turned to Theo and reached sadly for his hand, “when Tracy gave you her virginity, she expected that to be some kind of deal sealer. According to the elves, it’s nothing to do with blood status for her. She just fell in love with you. She hated the fact that you split up with her, and she blamed myself and Draco for that happening. She went along with the plan because she wanted to help Astoria, but also because she wanted to get back at all three of us.” 
 
  Eventually, it was Remus who broke the second stunned silence of the visit. “So what are you going to do about it all?” he asked, looking around the room. 
 
  The noise level abruptly jumped from nothing to full volume shouting. Hermione stuck her fingers in her ears and squinted desperately at Harry and then Ron, and a silent, wordless conversation passed between the three of them. Harry nodded his agreement straightaway, but Ron, as usual, took a little longer to come around. He rolled his eyes and slumped his shoulders, but eventually, when he could see that she was determined, he nodded his own, reluctant agreement. “Well,” Hermione shouted over the clamoring chatter, “I can only speak for myself here, and what you all choose to do is up to you, but I’m going to help them to break that curse another way.” She dropped her voice as the room fell silent, “and then I’m never going to speak to any of them ever again. 

  
  
  
  Hermione didn’t make it through double potions that afternoon. Theo walked out after only ten minutes of the lesson had passed, leaving his cauldron semi filled and the beginnings of his girding solution to solidify into a foul smelling, concrete like substance. Professor Slughorn called out after him in surprise, but Theo merely shook his head, glared murderously at Daphne who shrank back in alarm, then stalked out of the door. “Let him go,” Draco hissed, but Hermione couldn’t. Torn between her own barely started potion and one of the men she loved, she chose Theo and ran out after him. 
 
  Draco followed her out, and Professor Slughorn stepped into the corridor in confusion. By the time Hermione had apologized profusely and assured him that all three of them would catch up with the lesson after hours, she had lost sight of Theo. She winced as Slughorn’s irritated voice followed them up the corridor, “just because you’re too old for detentions, doesn't mean I can’t-” but Slughorn's voice faded away as she followed Draco up the stairs and out of the dungeons, and she didn’t hear what else he might do. 
 
  “When you saw those pictures this morning,” Draco said, stopping abruptly at the top of the stairs, grabbing her arm and spinning her around, “did you think it was him?”
 
  The tears Hermione had been holding back all day welled once more in her eyes. She nodded as she sniffed and wiped them dry. “I did for a few minutes, yes. Then I realized that nothing about any of it made sense, so I started to question it. I mean, why would Theo be standing there with bare arms in Hogsmeade in December? And then I looked at the other notes, and the writing matched, and then I found the Slytherin house photos and recognized that girl as Astoria’s friend. The elves helped though like I said, I’ve been suspicious for a while.”
 
  Draco nodded. “Are you 
  
    absolutely 
  
  sure it wasn’t him?” Draco’s eyes were slightly wild as he stared at her.
 
  “One hundred percent,” she nodded. “In fact, if you want solid proof, Kreacher actually saw them take the polyjuice potion. I’m totally, one hundred percent sure Theo didn’t do it. But you seem to need a lot of convincing on this. Why are you so suspicious of him?”
 
  Draco sighed, taking her hand as he started to walk again. He was silent for a while, rubbing his thumb gently across the back of their interlaced fingers. “All my life, people have lied to me, Hermione. They’ve pretended to be something they're not, and they’ve let me down for one reason or another. I’ve learned the hard way to be very suspicious. You want to know why this is such a clever ruse? You want to know why it’s so brilliantly evil? Because Theo’s cheated on almost everyone he’s ever been with before us. His past track record for staying faithful is appalling.”
 
  “So you 
  
    are
  
   doubting him then?” Hermione asked, trying to keep the accusatory tone out of her voice.
 
  “No. I’m not,” Draco admitted. “But, I just needed to double check before my insecurities got the better of me, and that’s nothing to do with Theo. My heart says something’s changed with him now. My heart tells me that this relationship of ours is for 
  keeps. The three of us are good together, and he’s changed so much, Hermione. I think I just needed reassurance that I wasn’t being too trusting. Not quite knowing who or when to trust has gotten me into a lot of trouble in the past.”
 
  Wiping her eyes yet again, Hermione stopped walking and turned into Draco, burying her face in his chest and feeling reassured by the strong arms he wrapped around her. She appreciated his open, heartfelt honesty. “We should find Theo,” she said after a few minutes.
 
  Finding Theo proved to be more difficult than either of them had planned, though. He wasn’t in any of the places they expected him to be. He wasn’t by the lake, behind the greenhouses, in the dormitories, or even in the Slytherin dungeon common room. “I really thought he’d be in here,” Draco said, watching Hermione look around in awe, “He used to love this window seat. He’d sit for ages watching the fish and waiting for the squid to pass by on one of its laps of the lake. Dammit, Hermione, that leaves one place left to check. I hate that bloody forest, but he’s going to be in there with the unicorns, isn’t he?”
 
  They found him twenty minutes later, sitting on a conjured blanket in the snow with Luna, watching the unicorn herd slowly munch through a bale of the hay that Hagrid had put out for them. Luna heard Hermione and Draco approach first. She turned around, then smiled and nudged Theo with her welly booted foot. Theo startled guiltily then sighed. “I thought you two wouldn’t find me out here.”
 
  “No,” Draco said with a smirk, “You knew I’d know where to find you, you just didn’t think I’d venture in here to do it. Hermione’s braver than me.”
 
  Theo nodded as Luna stood up. “I’ll leave you three alone, I think,” she said, and smiled as she drifted away through the trees. “Be kind to each other, please,” she called back as she walked away.
 
  “How long did it take you to work out that it wasn’t me in the pictures?” Theo asked, with his eyes firmly on the snow in front of him.
 
  “About five minutes,” Hermione admitted. “The most painful five minutes of my life.”
 
  Theo nodded. “I hate them for this, you know? I hate them for all of it. The slur at you, Hermione, our rap sheets being exposed to the whole world, the fact that they’ve used my weakness against me, the fact that they’ve tried to take you two away from me,” he said, gesturing towards her and Draco. “I’ve honestly never been as happy as I’ve been since I found you two. Draco’s probably told you, Hermione, I’ve cheated on people before. But I’ve never cheated on you, Draco.” He switched his desperately tormented eyes up to Draco’s face, silently pleading for understanding. “You were the one who wouldn’t commit to me, remember? Every time we briefly got it together, you were the one who ended things. I would never, ever, have been unfaithful to you, I only ever played around because nobody else meant as much to me as you did. I never lied about it, though,” he frowned as he picked up a handful of snow and crushed it between his fingers. “I never told anyone I was serious about them, nor did I ever promise to be faithful. I purposely never committed to anyone because I always wanted you, so does it even count as cheating if I’ve never been in an exclusive 
  relationship? Ask Blaise for fucks sake, he’s been with far more people than I have, yet somehow no one ever accuses him of this.”
 
  “Theo,” Draco said, sitting down beside him with a heavy sigh, “shut the fuck up, will you?” He swatted the snowball in Theo’s hand, and it fell through his fingers to the ground below. “I need to confess something too. I didn’t want to commit to you because that would have meant admitting that we were in a serious relationship, and I wasn’t ready to tell the world that I was bisexual. I was a coward and I’m sorry for that. I know you’ve never cheated on me.”
 
  “I’d never cheat on you either, Hermione,” Theo said, switching his piercing blue eyes to her. “You and I may not have the history that Draco and I have, but that doesn’t mean my feelings for you are less intense.”
 
  “I know that,” Hermione confirmed, sitting down on the blanket on his other side. “And I understand Draco being worried about coming out about his sexuality. I never thought I’d be in a relationship with two men,” she continued, sliding her fingers slowly through the snow. “It’s not something that’s done in the muggle world. It’s pretty much unheard of, except for in some fetish circles, and it’s certainly not what I expected to happen when I came back to Hogwarts this year. I’ll admit to having my own worries about what people might say. So, I understand your desire to keep that side of yourself private. I think it’s something you have to be ready to share. For what it’s worth, I hate those girls too. I hate them for trying to take you two away from me.”
 
  “But you still want to help them?” Theo asked, looking at her incredulously. “I don’t get it, Hermione. I could happily curse them all into dust right now.”
 
  “Yes,” she confirmed, deliberately ignoring his vitriol. “I do still want to help them. Part of me hates them, and part of me feels very sorry for them. Can you imagine how desperate Astoria and Daphne must feel to resort to doing something like this?”
 
  “I should hope they do feel desperate! It serves them fucking well right!” Theo exploded, abruptly hurling a snowball into the nearest tree and scattering the unicorns in all directions. He violently threw three more scrunched up handfuls of snow, then blasted his wand into the ground, sending a spray of ice crystals several feet up into the air. “I’m not as magnanimous as you are, Hermione. I can’t forgive this. I want to Crucio their bloody brains out right now, I want to make them pay for this, and if that’s my Father coming out in me, well, maybe people were right all along, and I am just like him. Maybe I didn’t have that fucking skull branded onto my arm, but maybe I should have done. Maybe you could see through the pictures, Hermione, but maybe you shouldn't just turn a blind eye to this.” He jabbed his fingers into the snow, hissing as he threw yet another snowball into the forest. “
  
    This
  
   is what I can really be like, This. right now.” He clicked his fingers and cast a bluebell flame into his hand, then sat watching it flicker in the fading light. “I hate feeling like this, alright?” he said finally after a long moment.
 
  “Then why don’t you stop beating yourself up and give yourself a break?” Draco cast his own bluebell flame and tossed it to Theo, who automatically threw his to Draco. They sat together, juggling little blue flames as Hermione watched them both in shocked silence. Draco seemed entirely unfazed by Theo’s outburst. “Remember when we accidentally set fire to Nott Manor doing this?” Draco asked, and finally, Theo laughed. 
 
  “Hey, ‘Mione, catch,” Theo said, tossing the flame to her. Fumbling wildly, she caught it then threw it on to Draco and the game expanded to include her as well.
 
  “‘Mione?” she asked, lifting a cautious eyebrow in his direction.
 
  “Harry, Ron, and Ginny call you that.”
 
  “They do,” she agreed with a smile. Theo just winked as he threw her the next fireball. She caught it easily this time, then threw it on. “How did you nearly burn the manor down?” she asked, still caught off guard by his abruptly changing moods.
 
  Theo grinned. “We were ten years old. We were bored, and we wanted to learn how to cast these flames. So we had a go, but we didn’t add the necessary cooling charms. Hence the flame was much too hot to hold, so we dropped it on the carpet, and whoosh!” He used his hand to mimic flames, and Hermione giggled. “I’m sorry for being a dick a minute ago. I’m sorry,” he admitted, meeting her eyes solemnly.
 
  “I forgive you,” she said. “It’s been a stressful day all round. Slughorn’s not very happy with any of us for walking out of class, by the way,” she admitted since Theo had calmed down and her brain had resumed its usual thought patterns.
 
  “No?” Theo grinned, catching a fireball and using it to light a cigarette, “I’ll aplogize to him later. He’d probably rather I’d done that than what I wanted to do, which was to curse Daphne into an incoherent heap on the floor.”
 
  “Would you really have done that?” Hermione asked, looking skeptical as she used the other flame to melt tiny balls of snow. 
 
  “I could have done it easily, yes,” Theo admitted, passing his fireball to Draco, then settling back on the blanket.
 
  “I know you 
  
    could
  
   have done it, what I asked was if you 
  
    would
  
   have done it?” she persisted. “If Daphne was standing in front of you right now, would you really hit her with an unforgivable curse?”
 
  Theo took a long drag from his cigarette then blew the smoke away from Draco who had moved to sit beside him. “Right now, I’m not sure. Ten minutes ago, yeah. I absolutely would have done it. I’m sorry for it, but I’m not going to lie to you. That's why I walked out of potions. I know the difference between right and wrong, but you have no idea how scared I was that I’d lose both of you over this, and when I’m scared, I tend to lash out.”  
 
  Slightly surprised, Hermione nodded. “Okay. So now you know you're not losing us, can you get a grip on that fear to help me to help Astoria, please? I don’t know how to break a blood curse. I know nothing about them, and I can see this from both sides. I can see how hurt we all are by this, but I can also understand how terrified she and Daphne must be to hatch a plan like this in the first place. I promise you, once the curse is broken, we need never speak to any of them again.”
 
  “My father would be the one to ask,” Theo said at length. “Blood magic is his speciality. And someone else who would probably have a good idea about it, would be Sirius. The Black family was well known for its propensity towards blood magic and curses, weren’t they, Draco? Did Bellatrix helpfully pass any of her messy obsessions with it onto you?”
 
  Draco nodded. “A little, but not enough to help here. Yes, Hermione, I’ll help you find out if we can break Astoria’s curse. I’m sure it can be done. I just don’t know how. What about you, Theo? Are you going to give us a hand?”
 
   The tip of Theo’s cigarette glowed cherry red as he inhaled. He closed his eyes, looking pained, then stared up to the sky as he blew the smoke away. “Yes, Hermione. As it’s you, and since you have the biggest heart of anyone I’ve ever known, I’m in. I’ll help you. Just don’t expect me to be civil to any of them while we do it alright?”
 
  Hermione grinned. “Thank you. I think I can manage that.”

   
 
   

  
    Chapter Text
    
  The potions lab was freezing cold and as dark as the dead of night. Hermione stepped inside on Wednesday evening shivering and feeling highly grateful for the roaring fire that Draco immediately lit in the fireplace. As the flames crackled into life, she hurried around the room, lighting the candle sconces on the walls and trying to keep an unhelpful, entirely unbidden image of the prison cells at Azkaban out of her mind. By the time all of the candles were lit and the room was as bright as it ever got, she had finally managed to push the intrusive vision away.
 
  What she couldn’t ignore was the reason the memory had lodged in her mind in the first place. She looked up as the door opened again, and Harry and Pansy strolled in to join them. “What’s up, Harry?” She asked, frowning at her best friend’s thoroughly disgruntled look.
 
  “Nothing much,” he replied evasively, still looking annoyed. Hermione frowned at his blatant lie but managed to hold her tongue long enough for him to continue. “I’d just rather not be spending my evening in here brewing Merlin knows what because my original potion congealed into a lump of concrete in class. It’s quidditch night after all!”
 
  “Oh,” she breathed in relief. “I see. Did that happen because you were worried about me?”
 
  “Partly,” he confessed, “and partly because I was struggling to restrain myself from hexing Daphne and Tracy. The way they kept glancing over at your empty desks, you three, I could very easily have hit them with something!”
 
  “You and me both,” Theo agreed. “In fact, I was going to. That’s why I walked out. Apparently, unforgivables aren’t allowed in the potions lab.”
 
  Hermione sighed. “No. They most definitely aren’t. Anyway, I’m not going to let them get away scot-free, if that’s what you all think,” she promised grimly, forcing the image of damp, cold, stone walls and bare, almost inhumane cells back out of her mind. “I fully intend to make them pay for every last drop of pain they’ve caused us.”
 
  “I should think so too!” Pansy exploded. I’m hurt by all of this myself because I considered both Daphne and Tracy to be my friends. For now, and since nothing else seems to be happening, I’m consoling myself with the fact that they’ve broken the first rule of Slytherin house.” She huffed and stamped her foot, looking disgusted at the thought. “When what they’ve done finally comes out, they’ll both be outcasts. So will Astoria. Happily, Millie and myself don’t sleep in the girl’s dorms with them any longer. If we did, I think I’d have punched them both already!”
 
  “What’s the first rule of Slytherin house?” Hermione asked curiously as she hefted her cauldron onto the table in front of her.
 
  “Loyalty,” Pansy, Draco, and Theo all said together.
 
  “You don’t fuck your friends over, no matter what the circumstances,” Draco elaborated and feeling rather touched, Hermione nodded.  
 
  “Do we have a first rule of Gryffindor house?” she asked Harry, aware that she was stalling for time rather than telling the others what she had done.
 
  Harry looked up from adjusting the flame under his cauldron. “Yes. Usually, it’s “don’t mess with Hermione Granger,” but I’m starting to worry that you’re losing your touch, ‘Mione. It’s been over two days, and you haven’t said a single word to anybody about what you’re going to do. You’ve asked us for patience, but I think you know that’s wearing thin. Ron says you’ve got one more day, or he and Ginny are stepping in. It’s not just you that these girls have hurt, remember.” He paused, looking from Draco to Theo to Pansy, all of whom nodded their agreement. “So you’re running out of time. Have you got a plan to make them pay?”
 
  Hermione turned away with a wry smile, despite the seriousness of the situation. She knew she was cornered. Bless Harry. He and Ron were still the only ones who could ever fully call her out like this. “Yes. I do,” she admitted, spinning on her heel to face him again. “And it’s taken me a couple of days to say anything because I had to organize it first. I had to owl Kingsley a few times, and he’s arranged this as a personal favor to me,” she broke off anxiously, feeling her heart pound as she tried to work out the best way of putting what she had done into words. 
 
  “But now I’m starting to second guess myself because a lot of this does depend on you two and how you feel about it,” she hesitated again, wringing her hands and turning to Draco and Theo with a half apologetic, half desperate look. “But, you both said you wanted to go, so I really, really hope you don’t mind what I’ve-”
 
  Harry removed his glasses, rubbed a hand over his eyes, then replaced them before blinking owlishly at Hermione. “Stop faffing, ‘Mione. Spit it out. Whatever you’ve done, it’s bound to be brilliant so just tell us!”
 
  “When you say you’ve been owling Kingsley,” Draco said, looking confused, “do you mean Kingsley Shacklebolt? As in Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister for Magic?”
 
  “Yes,” Hermione nodded impatiently. “And he’s surprisingly slow at returning my owls.”
 
  “Probably because he’s got a few other commitments on his mind, you know, like running the country?” Theo interjected, but Hermione ignored his quip. 
 
  “Theo, you seemed to think your father would be able to break the curse on Astoria. Kingsley’s granted us special visiting rights to Azkaban after classes tomorrow. If it’s alright with you, that is. I’d like to get everyone together to figure out how we can do this. Then, when we know we can break the curse, I want to confront the girls on Friday evening. I plan to do it in the eighth year common room, in front of as many people as possible.” She glanced up, relieved to see Pansy’s gleeful grin, Harry’s satisfied smile, and Draco and Theo’s identical looks of surprise. 
 
  “This way we’ve done the right thing by the girls. We’ve broken the curse so we haven’t ignored their suffering, but once they know that, and they know there is a cure, we let them have it. All of it. We bring everything they’ve done out into the open in front of everybody. The whole year group will know what’s happened, and they’ll have to live with themselves forevermore. The only reason I’m okay with publicly shaming them like this is because we’re also giving them a way of breaking this evil curse.”
 
  Once again, a resounding silence greeted her words. Hermione forced herself to hold her nerve. She knew it was a big ask, yet again, of Draco and Theo, and she’d been fretting over how they would both react ever since she’d received Kingsley’s confirmation owl at dinner.
 
  “Wow!” Pansy said after a moment, “I always wondered what the view from the moral high ground looked like, and now I know. It’s actually quite pretty up here. Granger, you're a bloody genius!”
 
  “It’s brilliant,” Draco said slowly. “This, uh, this visit to Azkaban though, is it just to Theo’s Dad’s cell, or-”
 
  “No, it’s to see Lucius too. If you want to see him, that is.” Hermione smiled sadly, it had taken an extra three, magically speed enhanced owls to get the finer details of the visit worked out. Hermione had needed to call in quite an enormous favor with the Minister himself to do it, but a double visit had been arranged. Thoronus Nott and Lucius Malfoy were both available for an hour's visit tomorrow evening. Together.  
 
  Draco closed his hand over hers on the desk. “I’d like that a lot, actually, Hermione. Left to myself, I’d probably never have arranged anything, and I really did want to see him over the Christmas holidays.
 
  “I know,” she said as Draco pressed a kiss to her lips. 
 
  “Thank you,” he whispered, then turned away to collect his cauldron.
 
  “I’m sorry you ended up mucking your potion up on our behalf, Harry,” Hermione said. “What do you think of my plan?”
 
  “That’s okay,” Harry conceded. “Under the circumstances, you’re forgiven. I think the plan is perfect. It’s just classic Hermione. I think Ginny may still hex Daphne and Tracy, though.”
 
  “Me too,” Pansy interjected. “We’ll compare curses beforehand, though, so we hit them with a good mixture of things.”
 
  Hermione nodded gratefully to Harry, then turned to Theo, ignoring Pansy’s remark because she had no idea how to answer it. “What about you, Theo? How do you feel about all of this? Because most of this plan depends on you and your Dad.” 
 
  Theo shrugged his shoulders then sighed, ruffling his untidy hair with his fingers. “I also think It’s perfect. You are-” he paused, looked briefly around the room, then back at her, “-you are coming with us right?”
 
  “If you want me too,” she said softly as Harry and Pansy turned away to give them a moment of privacy.
 
  “Yes, please.” He moved closer to her, then cupped her cheek in his hand and ran his thumb gently over her lips. “I need you to come. I can’t walk into Azkaban without your support.”
 
  The vulnerability in his eyes almost made her break down in tears. She nodded. “Theo, please be honest. Is this too much for me to ask of you? If it is, we don’t have to go. I can think of a different plan, we can just ask Sirius or look in the Grimmauld Place librar-”
 
  Theo cut her off with another kiss. “It’s fine, Hermione. Azkaban gives me the creeps, and I did once vow never to set foot on that Godforsaken island again, but I want to see my Dad. All I’m asking is that you’re beside me. With you and Draco beside me, it’s fine.”
 
  “You’ve got both of us-” Draco confirmed, thumping his cauldron down then giving Theo a soft kiss and a significant look. “Why are you here tonight, then Pans?” he asked, finally turning away from Theo to study the recipe they were going to follow. “Did your potion die a hideous death too?”
 
  “Of course not!” Pansy said indignantly. “I’m here for moral support. And because, well, because I figured that I could make another batch, partly for practice but mainly because it sells so well. Plus, I 
  
    was
  
   kind of hoping for another shag on Slughorn’s desk but since you lot are here too, that looks unlikely to happen. Theo, don’t say a bloody word, I am 
  
    not 
  
  doing that in front of you!”
 
  Having recovered from his trepidation about visiting his father, Theo flashed her his most innocent look then mimed zipping his mouth closed. “You didn’t have these concerns about doing it in front of Luna and Parvarti, now did you?” Draco asked, making Theo laugh. 
  Harry plonked his potions book down on the table and sighed, ignoring the provocation. “Anyway, Harry,” Draco continued, clearly enjoying winding his old nemesis up further, “I remember a time when you used to regularly mess up your potions because you were watching me. It makes a change for it to be Hermione’s fault!”
 
  Harry put his wand down and stared wordlessly at Draco while Pansy balled up her scarf and threw it at him. “Girding solution, then,” Theo said loudly, “before you two come to blows. I thought we’d just gotten over the emotionally charged portion of the evening! Shall we focus, boys and girls?!”
 
  Harry sighed, dropping his incredulous gaze away from Draco’s smirk. “I really don’t want to be doing this right now.”
 
  “Don’t you?” Theo asked as Hermione started sorting the necessary ingredients out on the desk. “You don’t think this is the perfect potion for brewing without the interference of a teacher?”
 
  Pansy giggled at Harry’s blank look. “Harry, what does Girding Solution actually do?”
 
  Harry sighed. “I don’t bloody know. I never professed to be any good at this subject, D.A.D.A. is my thing, you know, being the vanquisher of all evil? I’m no good with a cauldron. All I do know is that we’re all missing quidditch practice for this.”
 
  “Let me enlighten you as to why this isn’t a bad thing,” Draco said, opening a packet of fairy wings. “Firstly, it’s pissing down and freezing cold. I like to fly as much as anyone, but the rain has turned the snow to sloppy slush, the wind is howling, again, and I’m glad I’m not out flying in it tonight. Secondly, Girding solution enhances endurance. Take one vial of this, and you’ll have a lot more stamina than usual. If you know what I mean?”
 
  Harry’s eyes grew wide. “Oh,” he said softly. “Oh!”
 
  “Oh exactly,” Pansy passed him his stirrer. “Interested now, are you? And since Slughorn only wants one vial handed in from each of you, I don’t see why we can’t all make a batch, just turn in one vial each, and keep the rest.”
 
  “Girding solution has a short shelf life, but it sells amazingly well on the Hogwarts black market,” Theo said, pressing another kiss to Hermione’s lips, this one to silence her protests, “just saying.”

  
  

  
  

  The girding solution was annoyingly complicated to make. Slughorn stuck his head into the dungeon halfway through the evening, informed them that the quality of their potion would be included into their final N.E.W.T. scores, asked them to leave their labeled vials on his desk, bid them goodnight, then disappeared. “Not yet!” Draco yelped, grabbing Hermione’s wrist just as she was about to add a toasted dragonfly thorax to her bright orange potion. “Wait until the flying seahorse has completely dispersed and it’s turned turquoise, or you’ll have some side effects that will seriously upset the people we sell it to.”
 
  Hermione frowned but held back as instructed. “Are you really going to sell this?” 
 
  “Course I bloody am,” Theo chirped. “But I’m also going to take some myself, then I plan to fuck the pair of you senseless.”
 
  “I heard that!” Pansy squealed, but Theo merely laughed, “Merlin Theo, have you no shame?”
 
  Theo blew her a kiss. “Not a great deal, as you well know. Now, Hermione. Add your dragonfly now.”
 
  All in all, it was a miracle that by the end of the night, four labeled vials of what appeared to be perfectly brewed Girding Solution were sitting on Slughorn’s desk. Harry and Pansy were first out of the dungeon, Pany carefully pocketing several vials of illicitly smuggled potion on her way. 
 
  Theo eyed Hermione speculatively as Pansy’s giggles faded away down the corridor. “Do you have any idea how much I want you right now?” he asked, stepping forwards to cage her in against the desk.
 
  Immediately she whimpered, wondering what it was about Theo that brought this reaction out in her every time. She shook her head, sighing as he backed her up further, then rolled his hips into hers, grinding himself against her and instantly turning her legs to jelly. “I think you might need to tell me exactly how much,” she whispered.
 
  Draco chuckled and stopped tidying away to listen. “Do you want to know what I’m thinking about right now?” Theo asked, loosening her tie then undoing the top two buttons of her blouse. Staring into his brilliant blue eyes, she nodded. “Well, right now, I’m feeling the need to remind you that despite your unquestionable brilliance, and your quite frankly astonishing ability to wrap the Minister for Magic around your little finger, you belong to me.” Theo smirked at her sharp intake of breath and the loud gasp that Draco gave behind them.
 
  “You belong to both of us, in fact, and if one of us wants to hitch your skirt up, turn you around, bend you over your workbench, then fuck you senseless to remind you of that fact,” he paused to kiss her, then pulled back to look her in the eye once more, ”we can. In fact, both of us could. Right now.” He smirked, watching her sink her teeth into her bottom lip, and lifted an eyebrow in question. She nodded to encourage him to continue. “Draco would go first, and because of your transgressions and your blatant flirting with the Minister, he’d be at his most dominant. You’d be seeing stars by the time you came undone all over his beautiful cock.” 
 
  Hermione let her head fall back as another whimper escaped her lips. “Then,” Theo continued, “when you and he were done, it would be my turn.” He paused to kiss a line from her mouth, along her jaw, and down her neck. He sucked a love bite into her sensitive skin and she moaned, writhing against the crush of his powerful body. “Do you want to know what I’d do to you, beautiful?” he asked. 
 
  She nodded, still wriggling helplessly under his touch. “Well, I’d keep you bent over the desk, but I’d kick it up a notch. I’d bring your arms up over your head and tie your wrists together with my green and silver Slytherin tie-” he broke off, smirking at her moan, ”oh, you like that idea, do you?” 
 
  Utterly transfixed, as usual, she nodded once more. She felt Draco move up at her side, then begin to kiss her other cheek, and she pressed forwards into his touch. Theo chuckled, stepping back to give Draco space. “So, you’d be naked, bound, and bent over a desk right in the middle of the potions lab. I’d unzip my trousers, step up behind you and fuck you till you screamed my name, and remembered exactly….. who…. you….. belonged….. to.”
 
  “Mmmm!” she breathed as Draco’s hands slid down her sides. She felt his fingers brush against her hips and her skirt started to rise as he bunched the material up in his hands. 
 
  “You like the sound of that, gorgeous girl?” Draco asked, his hot breath tickling her ear. 
 
  Hermione nodded. “Yes!” She wondered, not for the first time if there was something wrong with her that made her enjoy being spoken to that way, but Theo just laughed softly.
 
  “No, sweetheart, you are perfectly normal to like this dynamic. Some girls would probably slap me for some of the things I say, but this is meant to turn you on. And, I 
  
    love
  
   the fact that it does. Stop worrying.”
 
  She wasn’t even surprised that he’d heard her thoughts. Instead she felt rather grateful for the reassurance. She nodded, wriggling her hips to encourage Draco further. He turned her around, then lifted the remaining material of her skirt so that her bottom was exposed to the chilly dungeon, and she silently congratulated herself on her choice of underwear. The dark green thong was one she had worn specially, hoping to tempt the boys after they had returned to their dormitories later that night.
 
  “Sweet fucking Salazar,” she heard Draco mutter, and she giggled as he ran the palm of his hand over her back, pushing her down over the desk then continuing to stroke his fingers down over her bottom. His first swat was gentle. She leaned forwards slightly more, bracing herself on her hands and sticking her bottom out further, then swaying her hips to encourage him. His next three slaps were not so soft. “Remember your safeword,” he whispered. 
 
  “Green,” she gasped, feeling his fingers venture under her thong. A moment later, his hands disappeared, and she heard the buzz of a zipper.
 
  “Keep talking, Theo,” Draco said as he stroked his hand over her tingling skin.
 
  “That’s such a pretty sight,” Theo said. Hermione could hear the satisfied smirk in his voice as he leaned casually against the neighboring desk. “Look at you both, so desperate for each other, so wet Hermione. I can see your beautiful cunt glistening in the candlelight.” 
 
  Draco used his knee to nudge her legs slightly further apart, and she felt the hard tip of his cock nudge up against her silken folds. He moved her thong to the side and she lifted up onto her tiptoes to get the position right. He pressed his hand on her back, bending her further over the desk, and she gasped. This was another new position, but she had been daydreaming about this scenario for a long time. The fantasy coming true now was better than she’d dreamed possible. 
 
  Draco moved his hips, slipping inside her with a muttered oath. He paused for a moment, but she no longer needed so much time to adjust to either of the boys' intrusions. She wriggled herself backward impatiently, smiling at his answering sigh as she impaled herself fully on him. “Is this angle alright?” he asked.
 
  She nodded breathlessly. “Oh! Yes!! She gasped as he started to move. “It’s perfect!”
 
  “It looks perfect from here too,” Theo confirmed. “All I can see is Draco’s beautiful cock sliding in and out of you, and it’s sexy as fuck. Those little mewling noises you're making are going to get us caught though, so unless you want Draco’s hand over your mouth, shhh.”
 
  Hermione gasped as Draco picked up his speed. “Are you comfortable?” he asked in a strained voice, and she whimpered loudly without thinking. “Shhh,” he breathed, echoing Theo, “unless you really do want my hand over your mouth?”
 
  The thing was, she did. She turned to meet Theo’s amused gaze as she attempted to push that thought into his mind. She’d already seen the subtle movement of his wand and felt the soft wash of the silencing charm he’d cast, so she knew there was no real danger of them getting caught. Holding his gaze, she let out another quiet but deliberate moan. “Hand, then Draco. If she can’t behave herself, you’ll have to make her.” Hermione closed her eyes as Draco’s hand slid around to cover her mouth, and he upped his pace, snapping his hips into her sharply with every thrust. 
 
  It felt so good, she braced herself against the table, bucking back into him, meeting his frenzied rutting, over and over until her breath came in pants around his fingers, and she struggled not to cry out in ecstasy. 
 
  Draco released her mouth then snapped her hips hard back into him. Her walls clenched desperately around him as he thrust deeper than she’d ever felt before, and a second later, he grunted as he reached his release. He fell forwards, supporting himself on his hands over her back while he caught his breath. After a moment, he carefully pulled himself out, then hurriedly zipped his trousers up while Hermione dropped her head down onto the desk.
 
  She tensed with a thrill of anticipation as she felt the brush of Theo’s hand over her bottom. “Hello, darling,” he whispered in a voice that made her knees buckle. “It’s my turn now. Are you alright?”
 
  Still gathering her scattered wits, she nodded. “Mmhmm. You?”
 
  “Yes. Very much so. How’s this beautifully pink bottom feeling?”
 
  “Good,” she gasped as he scratched his fingernails lightly over her sensitized skin. 
 
  “I thought I told you to be quiet while Draco was fucking you,” Theo growled, and she stilled as he dug his fingers slightly harder into her. “But you weren’t. She saw Draco wave his wand out of the corner of her eye, then let out a semi strangled yelp as Theo brought his hand down with a resounding crack. “That’s not being quiet either!” he said, sounding highly amused. 
 
  Hermione bit her lip, torn between wanting to submit to Theo’s commands as she usually did, and a new, reckless desire to push him further to see what he would do. He pulled his tie off, holding it up to examine it teasingly. As promised, he took one of her hands in his, then gently moved her arm up so that her hand was above her head. He left it there, then walked around to do the same on her other side. When he was satisfied she was comfortable, he dropped down to crouch at her eye level and slowly wrapped the tie around her wrists. “My, my. This color looks good on you too,” he said, then stood back to watch her test her bonds. 
 
  The feeling of being bound only increased her desire. She looked up at him and silently pleaded with him to touch her again. “You look so beautiful, Hermione,” he said, stepping back behind her and rubbing his hand gently over her inflamed skin. She stared straight ahead, transfixed by the tie that was wrapped around her wrists. She knew she’d never be able to look at another one without picturing this night ever again. 
 
  Theo’s next three slaps each increased in strength, and by his fifth stroke, all coherent thought had left her mind entirely. By the tenth blow she was desperate to have him inside her. She squirmed back against him and bucked backward into thin air. Her walls were clenching on nothing and her clit was throbbing with an intensity that bordered on uncomfortable.  “Alright, gorgeous?” he whispered, soothing away some of the sting with the palm of his hand. 
 
  The next thing she felt was his hands parting her thighs and his crazily talented tongue dipping down to taste her arousal mixed with Draco’s release. She squirmed wantonly against his languid licks, then hummed with relief as two of his fingers found their way inside her. 
 
  She gasped, stilling with shock as he licked a line all the way up to her bottom. “Yes or no?” he whispered, pausing with his tongue milimeters away from her most private parts. 
 
  “I’ve never, I mean, we’ve never-”
 
  “Not yet,” Theo confirmed, parting her cheeks with his hands and blowing a stream of cool air over her and making her shiver. “And we don’t have to if you don't want to. It’s your call. Yes or no, sweetheart?”
 
  “Yes, but,” she bit her lip as he licked her gently once more. 
 
  “But what?”
 
  “Nothing.”
 
  “Hermione, tell me.” His voice brokered no room for argument and she shivered wildly at the commanding tone.
 
  “I was going to say please be gentle, but then I realized I didn’t need to say that with you because you always are. Both of you are.”
 
  Theo paused, and she could imagine him nodding in satisfaction. “Good girl. You do need to say it because that tells me you're nervous about it. Anyway, we’re gentle when it’s right to be gentle, not always.”
 
  “And I'm delighted to hear that. I wouldn’t want you to be gentle all the time,” she replied then gasped as her brain caught up with her words.
 
  Theo chuckled. “Fancy pushing your limits, do you?” She was beyond being embarrassed by her body's response to that question now. This time she just nodded, whimpering incoherently yet again. “I’ll remember that,” Theo promised before dropping his head and licking directly over her puckered hole. She squirmed against him, it felt deliciously naughty and as his tongue circled her lazily, flicking back and forth before slowly dipping back down to her clit she wondered how it would feel to have one of the boys take her that way. 
 
  “You taste of Draco,” Theo said, standing up and dropping his trousers with one hand while he continued to caress her with the other, “the pair of you taste so good together.”
 
  She smiled as she felt his impossibly hard erection pressing against her and demanding entrance. After a moment of teasing, he slid straight up inside her already slippery depths. “So wet, Hermione, so soft and already full of Draco’s come.” Lost in her feelings, she could only nod, even as Theo pushed her down and picked up his rhythm to a frantic speed. “The only thing I don’t like about this position is that I can’t see your face. I like to watch your eyes as you come.'' 
 
  Frantically she nodded, her cheek pressing into the cool wood of the desk while her body burned with fervent desire. “Sweet fucking Merlin!” Theo grunted. “Come, sweetheart. Now!” She cried out, her body instinctively obeying his command, and her second intense orgasm of the night washed over her. When Theo moved away, she flopped down onto the table in front of her, totally spent. A moment later, she blinked as Draco crouched down at her eye level, grinning cheekily, while he untied her wrists. “Alright down there?!” he asked.
 
  “No!” she wailed dramatically, “I think I died. I don’t think I can move, ever again.”
 
  “Well, I don’t mean to worry you both,” Draco said, in a tone that instantly conveyed worry. “But I’ve already sent Slughorn away with a confounding spell once. I doubt it will work a second time without raising his suspicions. Come on, let’s get out of here!”
 
  That news gave Hermione the sudden jolt of energy she needed to get up from the desk. Wincing at her rather sore bottom, she righted her clothes, grateful for the hurried but thorough cleaning charm that Theo remembered to cast over her, then took his hand and followed Draco out of the door.
 
  They reached the top of the stairs just as Horace Slughorn appeared, walking rather unsteadily, whistling a cheerful tune and carrying a half empty bottle of Madam Rosmerta’s best mead and an empty box of crystallized pineapple in his hands. 

  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    
  The weather was horrendous on Azkaban Island. Hermione stepped away from the floo in the cold, stone arrivals station, brushed the soot from her clothes, then stared out of the open sided shelter in horrified dismay. She gazed wordlessly at Draco, who had gone through the floo ahead of her, but he said nothing. He seemed to be just as lost in thought as she was. Finally, she took the hand he offered, just as a tremendous gust of wind threatened to knock her clean off her feet. “Lovely weather, as usual,” Draco joked, and she nodded anxiously. Even in the pitch dark, the strain of coming here was showing palpably on his face. 
 
  Theo followed her out of the floo a full minute later, not looking at all his usual confident self. “Bloody hell,” he muttered, closing his eyes and breathing in deeply. “It still smells exactly the same.”
 
  “It’s the middle of the North Sea, love,” Draco said, wrinkling his own nose. “Sea water, wet stone, despair, and decay. That’s about all there is. Even now.” 
 
  Hermione stood mutely. She didn’t know what she could say to make this easier for any of them. Her first impressions of the island were terrible, and she didn’t have the memories of being incarcerated here that the boys did. She suddenly felt incredibly guilty for assuming that they would both simply take this visit in their strides. 
 
  The “arrivals lounge”, as it was laughingly called, was a small stone shelter with floor to ceiling open windows and a low roof that dripped with a mixture of sea spray and rain. It contained a single fireplace that led to only one destination, the departures lounge in the D.M.L.E. Wind, rain, and sea spray blew in on three sides and the stone underneath their feet was slippery with algae. Another huge gust of wind blew the stuttering flames in the fireplace completely out, and the whole place was suddenly plunged into total darkness. 
 
  “Is this really the new, 
  
    improved 
  
  version of Azkaban?” she wondered aloud, turning to look at Theo, who was attempting to light a cigarette. Every time he clicked his fingers, a flame flared briefly into life, illuminating his face with an eerie orange light before the wind blew it out. 
 
  “For fuck’s sake,” he muttered on his third attempt, before Draco stood in front of him, holding his coat open as a windshield,  “thanks.”
 
  “Getting here was worse before Shacklebolt stepped in,” Draco said, “Believe it or not, this is a relative improvement. Before they built this shelter, you crossed the sea by rowing boat, and if you survived the trip, there was a flight of slippery cliff steps to climb and then dementors floating all over the place to greet you at the top. Unless you were an Auror, of course, in which case you landed in the warm, dry, comfortably heated office.”
 
  “Are you alright?” Hermione asked, watching Theo, who was staying uncharacteristically quiet.
 
  “No,” he admitted, taking a long pull on his cigarette. “I will be, but I need a moment. That’s why I asked if we could arrive a few minutes early.”
 
  Hermione nodded sadly. “Take all the time you need.” She shuddered as the wind howled with renewed ferocity across the barren rocks. Every gust sounded like a scream of despair. “Are you alright?” she asked Draco, surprised when he nodded determinedly in the light of his Lumos spell.
 
  “Yes, actually, I am. Or I’m alright as I can be, at least. Theo, love, we got out. We should never have been held here. You know that. You used to say it to me all the time. If you don’t want to do this, turn back through the floo now and I’ll talk to your dad for you. You don’t have to do this to yourself.”
 
  Theo said nothing for a long while. He stood staring forlornly out of the open window ignoring the soaking sea spray in favor of glaring up at the stark triangular building that was just barely discernible in the shifting light of the moon. Hermione checked her watch. They had five minutes before they were due to report to reception. “You knew he’d react like this, didn’t you?” she asked, backing away from the worst of the weather.
 
  “Yes,” Draco admitted, shaking the latest gust of salt spray out of his hair. This was a hopeless, desolate place to come, made all the worse by it being seven o clock on a cold December evening. Hermione shivered in the highly inadequate shelter, trying to imagine how it must have felt to be locked up here. It was bad enough standing here like this. She couldn’t imagine how it must have felt to arrive on the island at seventeen years old, be thrown into a cell for crimes you had no choice in committing, and to have no idea of how long you were going to be locked up for. 
 
  Eventually, Theo turned away from the window, and Hermione breathed a sigh of relief. He took a last drag on his cigarette then flicked the end out into the incessant storm. “One of these days, I’m going to ask you to teach me proper Occlumency, Draco,” he said, looking at least marginally calmer. “Sorry for having a moment. I’m okay now.”
 
  Draco stared at him appraisingly. “That's good to know. Are you ready?”
 
  Theo laughed, but it sounded hollow and forced as it echoed in the freezing night. He shook his head, then turned with a rather labored looking smile. “Yep, I don’t know what kept you both. I think we’ve done enough loitering here. Are you ready, Blondie?”
 
  “Yes,” Draco conceded, giving a fond chuckle as he took Theo’s hand in one of his and Hermione’s in the other. “Are you ready, love?”
 
  “Ready,” Hermione confirmed, wondering if she really was. Now that she had adjusted to the shock of arriving on Azkaban Island and her concern for Theo had faded slightly, she had a new, much more pressing concern. She was about to come face to face with Lucius Malfoy and Thoronus Nott for the first time since the war, and the thought of that was as terrifying to her as arriving here had been to Theo.




  
  As the prison guard clinked his enormous magical keyring outside the visitors’ cell door, Hermione fought to control her panic. Theo brought her hand to his mouth, kissed her fingers, and held onto her tightly as Draco paced backward and forwards in the corridor beside them. “Here you are. You’ve got one hour,” The guard said, sneering at them all with the utmost contempt in his watery brown eyes. “I don’t know how you’ve wrangled this unmonitored visit,” he said with a derisive snort, “but just know that it’s highly irregular. We’ve got our eyes and our cameras on you at all times. We’re watching all of you,” he continued, glaring for some reason at Hermione who shrank back under his scrutiny. “Privilege means nothing here. This is Azkaban. Any funny business, and I don’t care who you are, you’ll be thrown straight into your own cell. Got it?”
 
  For some reason, the guards' vitriol seemed to be exactly what Theo needed to fully come back to himself. He smirked derisively as he yanked Hermione forwards again. “Watch who you're speaking to,” he growled as the guard snapped disapproving eyes onto him. “Kingsley Shacklebolt granted us this visit personally. Would you like to dispute it with the Minister himself?”
 
  “Theo!” Hermione hissed while Draco rolled his eyes. 
 
  “Oh come on, someone needs to put him in his place. He’s obviously got a problem with us.” Theo pushed his sleeves up in what Hermione suspected was an attempt to antagonize the guard further. She held her breath as the irate man glanced at the tattooed snake, then opened the door with a disgusted frown. 
 
  The guard said nothing more. He just ushered them into the room and made sure to give Draco a hard knock with his shoulder on his way out. The distraction in the corridor had worked a little too well for Hermione, who stopped dead as Lucius Malfoy and a tall man she vaguely recognized from the battle in the Department of Mysteries stood up to greet them.
 
  “Draco!” Lucius sounded delighted to see his son. He crossed the room in several long, hurried strides and pulled Draco into a tight, emotional hug. 
 
  “No touching,” The guard’s magically magnified voice sounded over the loudspeaker system. Both Draco and Lucius ignored it. A buzzer sounded, and Draco jumped back from Lucius, cursing loudly as a hefty stinging hex combined with a knockback jinx physically blasted them apart. 
 
  “Son,” Thoronus Nott said, staring with sharp blue eyes at Theo.
 
  “Dad,” Theo said quietly, then ignoring what had just happened to Draco, he stepped forwards into his father’s arms. “Fuck off!” he shouted as the automated voice warned them once again. “Ouch!” he yelled, flipping his finger at the barred window as he too received a shock and a thrust that catapulted him backwards away from his father’s embrace. 
 
  “Pushing. Your. Luck,” Draco warned him as he took Hermione’s hand and pulled her forwards out of her reverie. “Father, you know Hermione Granger, don’t you?” 
 
  Hermione summoned every ounce of the courage that seemed to have temporarily deserted her and forced herself not to falter under Lucius’ scrutiny. She met his cool grey eyes expecting him to make some kind of disparaging remark, but all he did was smile at her with a warmth that she hadn’t known he was capable of showing. “Of course,” Lucius said, tucking his long hair behind his ear, “but I don’t think we’ve ever been formally introduced. It truly is a pleasure to meet you, Miss Granger.” Lucius held out his hand, and hesitantly Hermione shook it. “I’d like to thank you for making my son so happy.”
 
  “Umm, that’s quite okay, Mr Malfoy,” she said, taken aback by his seemingly genuine warmth. She dropped his hand as the harsh warning voice sounded over the tannoy once more. “Draco’s made me very happy too.”
 
  “Lucius,” Theo stuck his hand out with a grin. To Hermione’s amazement, Lucius grasped it in both of his then pulled Theo into as enthusiastic a hug as he had given Draco.
 
  “Missed me, have you, Luc?” Theo said, patting him on the back then stumbling back as they both received yet another shock.
 
  “As it happens, I have.” Lucius straightened his robes, casting a glare of such ferocity at the door that Hermione wondered if it had burned the guard on the other side. “I wish you and Draco would have told me about your relationship years ago. I would have given you both my full blessing.”
 
  “Thank you, Sir,” Theo said, leading Hermione over to Thoronus, who was finishing greeting Draco. 
 
  “Sir?” Lucius questioned with an imperiously arched eyebrow, “since when have you called me Sir? Although, now that I think about it, I do quite like the sound of that.”
 
  Theo shrugged. “Well, it’s Sir or Lord of the Manor. Which do you prefer?” he asked with a grin that made Hermione choke on thin air.
 
  “You haven’t changed, I see,” Thoronus said, laughing as Theo turned his attention away from an amused looking Lucius. “For which I’m very glad. Now, Theo. There’s a charming, although very nervous looking, young lady here. You must introduce us.”
 
  Theo turned to Hermione with a proud smile. “Yes. There is. Dad, this is Hermione, mine and Draco’s girlfriend.”
 
  “Delighted to meet you, my dear.” Thoronus said, grasping her hand briefly and letting go before there was any danger of the shock. “And may I first commend your bravery at taking these two on,” he flashed Theo a wink, and Hermione hid a smile. She could see where some of Theo’s cheek came from. “Secondly, may I echo Lucius’ words, thank you for making my son so happy.” 
 
  Hermione smiled again, her nerves finally starting to dissipate as they all sat down. She was quite frankly astounded at how different Lucius Malfoy seemed to be. Either she had only ever seen his very worst side, or his change of heart during the war had caused him to have a complete personality turnaround. 
 
  Thoronus Nott was also a pleasant surprise. Hermione studied him as he chatted happily with Theo. The resemblance between father and son was striking, although Thoronus’ hair was poker straight and heavily flecked with grey. Physical similarities aside, Theo seemed to have inherited a lot of his father’s personality traits too. Thoronus was clearly a brilliant man, but it was easy to see where Theo’s belligerent attitude came from. There were a couple of times, mainly when Lucius said something amusing, that Thoronus caught his son’s eye, and they both gave identical smirks or came out with almost the same quip. 
 
  Hermione was surprised by how chatty both Lucius and Thoronus seemed to be. She blinked away her bemusement at finding herself discussing her extra credit N.E.W.T. project with Lucius, then settled back to tell Thoronus how they had recently flown through a blizzard to rescue several cold and unhappy bowtruckle families from the icy winter weather.
 
  “Your mother loved that island,” Thoronus said, looking at Theo sadly. “I used to take her over there quite often when we were students. We’d circle the lake on the broom looking for the squid, then land on the island’s shore. She had a way with creatures, Flora did. The bowtruckles came to know that she brought a good supply of woodlice. They used to run up to her then just clamber all over her. It was incredible.”
 
  “That must be where Theo gets his love of magical creatures from,” Hermione breathed, blinking back a tear and thinking about the parents that she and so many of her friends had lost.
 
  “Yes,” Thoronus swept his eyes over her face, “it is. You know, you look very much like my Flora. She was a little taller than you, slightly broader too, but other than that, you are quite similar.”
 
  “You should show your dad your patronus, Theo.” Draco said with a soft smile.
 
  Thoronus looked surprised. “You learned to cast a Patronus, son?”

   

  Theo nodded. “I did. Hermione and Harry taught me.”
 
  “Harry? As in Harry Potter?” Thoronus blinked, then shook his head.
 
  “Yep. You must know he’s Hermione’s best friend?” Theo grinned at his Dad’s obvious bewilderment. “He’s alright actually, I’ve grown quite fond of him and Ron Weasley as of late, and that’s something I never thought I’d say!”
 
  “I did know he was Hermione’s friend,” Thoronus conceded, “I just didn’t realize that meant you and he were now friends as well. You know what, son? Good for you. What’s your Patronus then?”
 
  Theo stared down into his lap for a moment, squeezing Hermione’s hand so hard it hurt. “It’s a lioness.”
 
  Thoronus stared at Theo for a long moment then exchanged a glance with Lucius. “A Gryffindor lioness?” Theo nodded as his father pressed his lips together firmly, taking a moment before he continued to speak. “I told you she watches over you, didn’t I? I’ve never been able to cast one, but Flora could. Do you remember hers?”
 
  Theo nodded, closing his eyes as Draco took his other hand. Hermione couldn’t help glancing curiously at Lucius, wondering what he really thought of their relationship, but his face was unreadable. “Of course I do,” Theo said sadly. “It was a ball python. She used to cast it and it would slither all over me when I was little. I used to imagine it tickling my skin, even though I couldn’t feel the vapor.”
 
  Thoronus wiped his eyes with the back of his hand then stood up. He stepped round behind Hermione and dropped a hand onto Theo’s shoulder. “I’m told her Patronus was a snake because she fell in love with me. And now, of course, yours is a lion because of your love for her. Gods, I miss her.” He jumped away at the latest sharp knockback, then flipped his finger at the guard outside the door in exactly the same way that Theo had done previously. Hermione rubbed her tingling arm. The shock had travelled through Theo into their clasped hands. She shook her smarting fingers, wondering if there was any need for the shocks to be so severe.

   

   “I take it you don’t have your wand in here?” Thoronus asked, sitting back down.
 
  “No,” Theo admitted, “the guards took it.”
 
  “Of course,” Thoronus said with an exaggerated eye roll. “When I’m out will you show me, please?” Theo nodded. “Was it a shock when you cast it, and it took that form?”
 
  Theo nodded. “You could say that. Draco’s is a thestral by the way, Lucius.”
 
  Lucius raised his eyebrows looking impressed. “Well, at least that’s something fitting with the Malfoy history and aristocracy,” he said, hiding what looked like a wry smirk.
 
  “Better than yours then, huh?” Thoronus grinned, apparently having snapped out of his melancholy mood. Hermione blinked, struggling to keep up. He seemed to be just as mercurial as Theo. 
 
  “I thought you couldn’t cast one?” Draco said, staring accusingly at his father as Lucius appeared, though Hermione could barely believe it, to flush.
 
  “Ha! Is that what he told you?” Thoronus threw his head back and laughed, “Oh come on, Malfoy, fess up.”
 
  “Yeah, You can’t get out of this now,” Draco said, looking half amused, half incredulous, “come on Dad. What the hell is it?”
 
  “I’d rather not say,” Lucius averted his eyes, and Hermione shivered, suddenly he looked every inch the austere man that she had previously come to know.
 
  “I will then. It’s a hedgehog,” Thoronus said, his shoulders shaking with laughter. “It’s cute as hell and prickly as fuck, just like its owner-”
 
  “You,” Lucius sniffed disdainfully as he cut Thoronus off, “are dead to me.”
 
  “Okay,” Thoronus gave a comically exaggerated roll of his eyes, and Theo and Draco both dissolved into peels of laughter, “I’ll bear that in mind.” 
 
  Hermione blinked back an incredulous smile. She couldn't quite believe how easy this visit was turning out to be. Now that she had relaxed, she was thoroughly enjoying herself, and that was the very last thing she had expected when she had been hesitantly owling Kingsley to organize it. 
 
  She checked her watch and was startled to see that there were only fifteen minutes of visiting time left, and they hadn't even mentioned the Greengrass family curse. Subtly trying to get Draco’s attention, she reminded him in a whisper, and he nodded. “Father, we have a bit of a problem.”
 
  “We thought you might,” Lucius said. “Don’t worry, Hermione,” he said kindly, rolling her name over his tongue as if trying it out, “I know Draco wanted to visit me anyway. He told me so in his letter. I figured there was a reason the three of you needed to come urgently. What’s wrong, Son?”



 


  All too soon, the still remarkably unfriendly guard announced that their time was up. Hermione was surprised when Lucius pulled her into a tight goodbye hug. “Please continue to look after Draco for me, Hermione,” he whispered as she yelped, jumping back from the latest round of shocks. “He didn’t deserve any of what the war put him through.”
 
  “I will,” she agreed, bracing herself for yet another knockback as Thoronus also offered her a goodbye hug.
 
  “Thank you,” he said earnestly, “for everything. I haven’t seen Theo this happy in a long time.”
 
  “Ouch!” she gasped, jumping back in annoyance yet again, “that’s quite okay. I’m glad to make both of them happy.” 
 
  Theo caught her and waited for her to confirm that she was unhurt before he turned to glare ferociously at the smirking guard. “If I had my wand,” he muttered.
 
  “You and me both,” Thoronus agreed.  
 
  “This way,” the guard said, looking delighted by their annoyance. He ushered them out of the visiting cell with a sneer and then abruptly clanged the door shut behind them. “Visit’s over. Out you go.”
 
  “Real little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” Theo muttered, dropping his voice at the last moment in response to Draco’s exasperated huff.  
 
  “Will you stop 
  
    trying
  
   to antagonize him?! I don’t want to spend the fucking night here,” Draco admonished. Theo said nothing more, just chose instead to grumble quietly under his breath in what sounded like a foreign language. Hermione wasn’t quite able to make out what he was saying, but from Draco’s quiet laugh, she guessed that he could, and that it wasn’t polite. 
 
  The storm was still raging outside. Hermione wondered if it ever stopped. She gripped Theo’s hand as they dashed out of the main prison building, across the perilous rocks, and into the stone shelter. “The thing I hate the most about all of this,” Theo said, practically shoving Draco towards the floo before pointing his wand into the windswept grate, “is that we can’t just take them with us.”
 
  “When do they get released?” Hermione asked, adding her wand to Draco and Theo’s in an attempt to increase the strength of the weakly sputtering flames. 
 
  “Lucius gets out in May, but my father has another two years.” Theo sighed, picking up the box of floo powder.  
 
  “Yeah, because of the murders he committed on my behalf,” Draco said, looking troubled. “Any chance you can chat Kingsley up for a reduction in his sentence, Hermione? Exactly how far do your favors go with the Minister?”
 
  “It really doesn’t seem fair, does it?” she asked sadly, watching the flames grow in strength. Draco took a pinch of the glittering powder then shouted “Department of Magical Law Enforcement” into the fireplace.
 
  “No, but in the eyes of the law, Murder is still murder,” Theo said sadly, watching Draco spin out of sight. It’s still taking somebody’s life. I don’t think there are any mitigating circumstances for casting Avada Kedavra. It wasn’t the first time he’d done it, either.”
 
  “Are you saying he shouldn’t have helped Draco then?” Hermione asked, turning her mind away from whoever else Thoronus might have murdered and realizing just what a thorny subject this was.
 Theo sighed. “No, because Draco wasn't able to do it himself, and the Dark Lord knew that. He’d set Draco up to fail, again. He knew that if by some miracle Draco shot successful killing curses, then the guilt of that would have slowly destroyed him. If Draco had shot the curses and they’d failed, Voldemort would have killed him for being magically weak, and if he’d refused to shoot them at all, then The Dark Lord would have killed Narcissa as punishment for his disobedience. He had his wand pointing at her heart, don’t forget. I was there, I witnessed the whole sorry mess. My Father did the only thing he felt he could do to save Draco, but this is his punishment for it. As I think I once said, I like to think Lucius would have done the same for me, but I’d hate the guilt I’d feel if he had.” 
  Hermione nodded sadly. The whole war really had been horrific. “Based on how fond Lucius seems of you, I’d say he probably would have done the same thing,” she agreed. “Come on, or Draco will think we’ve gotten lost. Let’s go.”



  
  It was a relief to finally floo back into the headmistress’ office at Hogwarts. Minerva McGonagall looked up sharply from her desk as Hermione brushed herself down on the hearthrug then vanished the pile of damp soot with her wand. “Good evening, Miss Granger, Mr Nott. I trust your visit went well?” Hermione nodded, hoping Professor McGonagall wasn’t upset by what they had done. She had been so busy arranging things with Kingsley that she had left it rather late to ask her old head of house for permission to use the direct floo to the Ministry. Happily, the headmistress had agreed without asking too many questions about their sudden need for a prison visit. 
 
  “Yes, thank you. It went as well as we could have hoped, anyway,” she said, taking the hand Draco offered and ignoring Professor Mcgonagall’s slight, reflexive reaction to seeing the physical evidence of their relationship.  
 
  “I suggest you three have a shower, then go to bed,” she said kindly as Draco turned away, looking slightly hurt. “Or better still, a bath. The prefect’s bathroom should be free at this time of night.” Hermione nodded her thanks then turned to follow the boys out of the door. “Mr Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall called, making Draco pause. “Please do not misunderstand me. I do not disapprove of your relationship. Not that it would be my place to do so in any case, but on the contrary, I’m pleased to see the three of you happy. I am merely not as adept at hiding my reactions as some people are. That is all. You may go.” 
 
  All three of them were silent as they walked back to the dormitories hand in hand. Hermione wasn’t sure what could be said. They had the plan they needed. Thoronus had seemed confident that he could break the curse via Narcissa, all they needed to do was to arrange for Astoria and Daphne to visit her in France. 
 
  Narcissa was apparently already well versed in blood magic and blood curses, thanks to Bellatrix’s somewhat messy obsessions with the subject, and Thoronus had promised to discuss the matter with Lucius and other unnamed “friends”, then to issue Narcissa with full instructions on how to proceed. Both he and Lucius were confident that the curse would be successfully broken before Astoria came of age.  
 
  A bottle of firewhisky was waiting for them on Draco’s pillow. “Alright?” Blaise asked, looking up from the book he was reading while lying sprawled out on his bed. Draco shook his head, uncapped the bottle, and took a hearty mouthful before passing the bottle on to Theo.
 
   “That bad, huh?” Greg asked.
 
  Theo sank down into the chair beside their bed and unlaced his boots. “Yeah,” he said sadly. “It wasn’t great. I miss him, alright. I know what he is. I know what he did, but he’s my dad. I just miss him.” Nobody spoke as Theo shook his head and gulped down another large mouthful of whisky.
 
   “You don’t have to defend him to us. We don’t think badly of you for missing him,” Blaise said. 
 
  Theo saluted him with the bottle then passed it back to Draco. “Thank you.”
 
  “I’ve been to Azkaban,” Greg said quietly. “It’s horrific there. You want to talk about it?”
 
  “Not tonight,” Theo sighed. “Thanks, though. I’m going for a shower. I stink of the North Sea and of prison. Neither one of those is my favorite scent.”
 
  Draco offered the firewhiskey bottle to Hermione. She took it and swallowed a small mouthful, feeling it fortify her slightly despite the uncomfortable burn in the back of her throat. “Thanks for this,” Draco said, holding the bottle up as Blaise nodded. “Come on, let's get ourselves cleaned up, then let’s sleep. By the sound of your plans, Hermione, tomorrow’s going to be another busy day.” 
 
   
  
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione woke up early on Friday morning, turned her face into the pillow, and groaned. She was still exhausted, but a quick tempus spell told her it was almost time to get up. As he always did when he woke, Draco reached out and pulled her into his arms while Theo continued to snore softly, unbothered by the movement beside him.  Hermione sighed as she pressed herself into Draco's familiar warmth. It had been a difficult night. Dreams of unyielding prison cells and vindictive Azkaban guards had caused her to sleep almost as fitfully as Draco had. She sighed. She knew she hadn’t even begun to process the events of the previous day, but there was no time to linger in bed to do so now. Today was the day she had vowed to confront Daphne and Tracy, and since it was also the last day of term, there was no way she could put it off until a later time.   Despite Draco’s mumbled protests, Hermione forced herself to leave the comfort of his arms. She took her time getting ready, feeling unwilling to face the drama the day was bound to bring. She stood for too long in the shower, then brushed her teeth as slowly as possible. When she finally came out of the bathroom, she was still yawning widely.  Theo was nowhere to be seen, but he returned as she was pulling her crumpled uniform on and passed her two slices of toast that he’d kept warm under a stasis charm. “Thank you,” she said, taking them gratefully while trying and failing to stifle another yawn.  “Here. Take one of these,” Theo said, looking at her appraisingly. He opened his bedside drawer and took out what appeared to be a pair of socks. “Just a mo. Revelio,” he passed his wand over the balled up material, and the socks morphed into a vial of blue liquid. “It's the Girding solution from the other night. There’s only a couple of vials left now.” Hermione stared at him through suspiciously narrowed eyes. “What do you mean? You haven’t actually sold the rest of this?!" Her eyes widened with dismay at his easy nod. "How much did you sell it for?” “Five galleons a vial,” he grinned, then ran his fingers through his curly hair in lieu of using a brush. “What did you think I was going to do with it? Tip it down the drain?” Hermione abandoned the half formed protest dancing on the tip of her tongue, closed her eyes, then let out a sigh. “Sweetheart, don’t stress,” Draco said, nudging the vial closer to her, “he’s done this for years, and really, Girding Solution is harmless compared to some of the things he’s sold in the past. I thought you knew about the Hogwarts black market. Anyway, there were rumors of you tipping lots of illicit revision aids down the drain when we were studying for OWLS in our fifth year.” Hermione winced, wishing he hadn’t brought that particular subject up. She didn't like being reminded of how overzealous she'd been in those days. “In my defense, they were fake revision aids. A lot of them were harmful. I mean, someone was selling powdered doxy eggs under the guise of it being a concentration aid-” “Youch!” Theo winced. “That wasn't me. I only ever sell the good stuff. Which is why I have such a long list of loyal customers.” “Who exactly are these customers?” she asked, chewing her toast while trying not to look overly shocked by his confessions. Instead of answering, Theo turned away and began to hunt for a real pair of socks in his disorganized trunk. Hermione rolled her eyes. Theo’s trunk was in a worse mess than Harry’s.  “Oh look, love,” he smirked, pulling out a bunched up green and silver tie. “Remember this?” “Don’t you dare try to distract me, Theodore!” she said, trying to look stern despite her shiver of interest. “What’s that, sweetheart? You want me to bring this tie to Grimmauld Place with us for the holidays? I think I can manage that.” Hermione gave a huff which turned into a laugh and then an affected sigh at the suggestive way he licked his lips. “You’re incorrigible,” she scolded, eyeing the vial of Girding Solution that Draco was still holding. “Yep,” Theo agreed cheerfully. “But I’m also discreet. You didn’t know I’ve been siphoning potions out of my cauldron and selling them covertly for the last four years, did you?” “No,” she mumbled through a final mouthful of toast, “funnily enough, you never told me that.”
  
  

  
  
Hermione was on tenterhooks all day. Midway through the morning, she was seriously regretting her stubborn refusal of the Girding Solution and was just about to swallow her pride and tell Theo as such when he produced the stoppered vial from his pocket with a flourish. “As you wish, my lady,” he said with a wink, and she steeled herself, took a deep breath, then downed the lot in one.  After a brief moment of panic, when it felt as if she had swallowed a red hot poker, the most wonderful feeling of relief flooded through her, it felt similar to taking a vial of pepper up, but with less of the fizzy energy that particular potion brought. The Girding Solution gave her a feeling of calm resolve, and she smiled gratefully at Theo, who glanced around then stuck the empty vial back into his pocket.  “Daph looks worried,” Draco said, lifting the notice me not charm he’d cast in the corridor. “Good!” Theo said smoothly, walking calmly away as if nothing against the school rules had happened. “Alright, Trace?” he smiled as Tracy dashed past them looking harried.  “They must know something’s going to happen today,” Draco said grimly. “They know we found the notes. They’ve avoided us all week and today’s the last day of term. Theo, can you hear what's going on in their minds?” Looking frustrated, Theo shook his head. “Nope. I've tried, but I'm just getting complete silence from both of them. They’ve both blocked me out with Occlumency. How do you feel now, love?” “Better,” Hermione admitted truthfully, trying to stamp down her mixed feelings. She  did  feel better, but partaking in Theo’s illegal potions sideline somehow didn’t sit quite right with her. “Right. Come on,” she said, shaking her head to dispel her lingering irritation, “let's get through the rest of this day, shall we?”
  
  

  
  
Getting through the rest of the day proved to be slightly easier than Hermione had anticipated. She kissed Theo goodbye when he left for Herbology and turned towards Ancient Runes with Draco’s hand clasped firmly in hers. The double lesson passed without incident, as did Transfiguration, then Charms, and finally, the bell rang, signaling the end of term and the beginning of the Christmas Holidays. “Well, that's that,” Draco said several hours later, stretching his arms up above his head once the end of term feast had finished. “Now it's properly holiday time. Once we've confronted the girls of course. When exactly do you want to do that, love?” Completely transfixed by the inch of bare skin showing where his shirt had ridden up, Hermione missed the question and was startled when he repeated it. “Later!” she squeaked hastily, wincing at Harry’s sympathetic look. "Quite a bit later, when everyone's settled into the common room for the evening."  To avoid Daphne, Astoria, and Tracy, she, Draco, and Theo had chosen to eat at the Gryffindor table. Still, by now, the mixed house seating arrangements were so regular that nobody even raised an eyebrow. The downside of sitting in her old seat was that Hermione was now almost exactly opposite the trio of girls they needed to confront, and that was doing nothing to settle her nerves. “She looks terrible,” Hermione said, some of her resolve to make the girls pay slipping away at the sight of Astoria’s exhausted appearance.  “They’ll fix her, don’t worry,” Theo said reassuringly. “I know it’s not a great claim to fame, but my father was Voldemort’s go to for matters of blood magic. Between him and Bellatrix, they had just about every aspect of it covered.” “Who else is he going to talk to? He mentioned friends,” Hermione asked, “although since he’s stuck inside Azkaban, I’m a little scared to ask who they could be.” Theo snorted, using his finger to scoop up the last swathes of cream from his plate, “Probably one of the Lestrange brothers. They were all into the blood magic nonsense together,” he said with a disdainful frown. “Oh.” She jumped as Theo bopped the end of her nose and left a small blob of cream behind. “Hey!” she wiped it off with a giggle then pressed it to his lips, gasping as he sucked her finger straight into his mouth.  “Don’t worry about my father's friends, and don’t tease me,” he whispered in a voice that caused a thousand butterflies to take flight in her stomach, “unless you're prepared for where that might lead.” “I find I can prepare myself for where you take things rather well these days,” she grinned, holding his eye contact and willing him to listen to her thoughts. "Also," she continued, "I could do with a distraction right now." Theo’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed, and Hermione smiled in satisfaction. He leaned in close, moved a stray tendril of her hair, then licked the shell of her ear. “Do you really think daring me is a good idea?" He whispered, and she had to hold back a whimper at the desire swirling in his blue eyes. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake, get a bloody room!” Ron grumbled, staring at Hermione in dismay as Theo moved down to give her neck a sensual kiss.  “Oh, we intend to, Weasley, don’t worry.” Theo sent him a scandalous wink, and Ron turned back to Seamus, looking rather put out. Hermione let out the breath she had been holding in a shaky sigh. Her thighs quivered, and she pressed them together, trying to tamp down the white hot lust that had pooled low in her belly. Theo moved his hand to her thigh and squeezed gently, doing nothing to calm the sudden inferno inside her. “We’re in public!” she hissed, but he just smirked then shifted his hand higher.  “You asked for a distraction, love. If you're feeling shy, you’d best be quiet. Either that or tell me to stop,” he said, pressing a finger to his lips as Professor McGonagall stood up to speak. Hermione's eyelids fluttered closed then snapped open again, only to see Theo licking a suggestive line along his finger. "I told you not to dare me, didn't I?"  By the time they finally made it back to the common room, Hermione was a needy, quivering mess. Theo had brought her to the very brink of orgasm twice, and both times his fingers had stilled at exactly the wrong, or in his opinion, the right moment. “All you have to do is use your safeword, and I’ll let you come,” he’d drawled, and she’d glared heatedly at him, having no intention of doing any such thing. “Bed. Now,” he whispered, his tone brokering no room for argument. Not that she would have resisted in any case. She hurried across the room, kicked off her shoes, and hopped up onto their enormous bed. “How are you feeling?” he asked, looking at her softly as he crossed the room. “Is this okay, or is it too much directly before we confront the girls?” “It’s perfect,” she admitted. “We’re too early to do that right now, and this is just the distraction I need.” Theo's soft smile turned back into the predatory smirk that excited her so much. He nodded once. “Hike your skirt up.” Shivering, she did as he asked, then bit her lip, watching him stare heatedly at the tiny thong she was wearing underneath. “This is soaking wet,” he observed, pulling the scrap of material from between her swollen folds. “Who’s made you so wet, Hermione?”  “You did.” She gasped as he blew a stream of cool air over her already sensitized flesh.  He nodded. “How did I do that?”  “By, ahhhh…. by bringing me….. ohhhh…. so close to… mmmmph…… orgasm twice already!” She gasped as he brushed his fingers over her throbbing clit, watched her closely, then slid two fingers inside her and twisted them sharply. “Fuck, sweetheart. You’re so wet. So ready for my cock. What do you want me to do?” She paused for a moment, smiling as she remembered a conversation she'd had with Pansy earlier in the week. “Whatever you want to do to me, Sir.” The effect was instantaneous. Theo took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and groaned. “You and Draco are going to be the death of me. Turn over.” He patted her thigh and she flipped over onto her stomach, grateful that he couldn't see her triumphant smirk. “You liked this position when we tried it the other day, and Draco and I have got something in mind for the future, so let's see how you like this now.” He paused as the dormitory door opened and footsteps padded across the wooden floor. “Knock knock,” Draco called, wiggling the bed hangings. Theo raised a questioning brow at Hermione.  “That you?” Theo asked when she nodded her consent. “Uh, yeah,” Draco replied, sounding confused. “Is anyone else in here?” “Blaise is.” Theo dropped his voice to a low whisper. “Slip through carefully then, drop your pants and let Hermione suck you off while I fuck her.” Hermione buried her face into the pillow with a soft gasp as yet another rush of intense arousal flooded through her. “Merlin’s tits, Theo, let me get out of here first!!” Blaise’s horrified voice floated across the room making Hermione wince and Theo laugh.  “Evening,” Draco said, once Blaise’s heavily booted footsteps had faded away and the outer door had slammed shut. He slipped through the gap in the curtains then stopped short, staring at them both appreciatively. “Zabini seems a little upset.” Theo merely grinned. “Ginny can soothe his ruffled feathers, I'm sure. On the bed, Draco. Drop your pants, get underneath Hermione and think filthy thoughts. We haven't got long.  Hermione gasped as Draco did exactly as he was told. He was rock hard already, and she couldn’t resist running a hand over the silken skin of his erection. She licked her lips at Draco’s appreciative hiss, wanting to taste him in her mouth. “Wait a minute,” Theo warned, and Hermione reluctantly drew her hand back. “You both look gorgeous like this,” Theo said, shucking off his belt then dropping his trousers to the floor. “I love your hair now it’s growing out, Malfoy. I've been meaning to tell you that for days.” Draco smiled, running his fingers through his messily tousled hair. “I thought it needed a trim, but that’s fine. I’ll leave it like this,” he said, waiting patiently for Theo’s next command. “Feel how wet Hermione is. She’s so ready for me to slide my cock deep inside her.” “Oh hell!” Draco groaned as he stroked his fingers through her soaking wet curls. His cock twitched against his stomach, and Hermione ached to lick away the tiny bead of precome that was gathering as she watched. “How did this happen? We just got back from dinner!” Theo smirked. “I hope you were paying attention to McGonagall’s speech, Draco, because we weren’t. I was fingering Hermione at the table. She nearly came all over my hand twice but I drew back and made her wait both times. She’s desperate right now, aren’t you, love?” “Yes,” she gasped.  “Tell Draco what you’re so desperate for.”  “I’m desperate for your cock, Sir.” Theo just closed his eyes and sighed. “If I die tonight, it’s because this has killed me. I don’t know where this textbook submissive stuff has come from, sweetheart, but I like it.” Hermione’s eyes widened as Theo took her hips in his hands. He lifted them until she was on her hands and knees, with her face hovering directly over Draco’s groin. He pressed gently on her back, and her head naturally dipped down lower. “If you want to safeword but your mouth is full, slap the bed,” he commanded and she nodded.  She waited while Theo rubbed the flat of his hand over her bottom, then lifted his hand and brought it down with a sharp crack. The smarting sting caused her to groan wantonly again. “Suck Draco off for me, love,” Theo said, and Hermione finally took Draco’s cock into her hand and guided the weeping head into her mouth. “Look at you. So pretty with your mouth so full. You like doing this, don’t you? I can feel how  much  you like it right here,” he said as his hand came down on her again. “You're dripping. Sucking Draco makes you want me even more, doesn’t it?” Hermione couldn’t speak, her mouth was too full, but she nodded frantically, wriggling her bottom in an attempt to encourage Theo to enter her. “Keep still,” He admonished, spanking her once more, then rubbing gently to soothe the sting.  She could feel Draco tensing underneath her, could feel the tightening of his thighs and the strain in his chest, and  still Theo hadn’t touched her. Her walls were contracting, clamping almost painfully on air, and just as she was bracing herself for Draco to come, Theo stroked her back gently. “Stop,” he whispered, and she paused with her lips still around Draco’s impressive length.  “You're a git, Theo,” Draco groaned.  “Patience blondie,” Theo said, as Draco rubbed a hand over his eyes. “I promise I’ll make it worthwhile. Start sucking him again, Hermione. Gently though.” Draco’s orgasm built much quicker this time. He bunched the bedsheets in his hands, twisting them in his fingers as Hermione worked her lips up and down. He tensed again, and Theo told her to pause once more. By now, she was as thoroughly worked up as Draco was. When Theo told her to move again she sank lower down Draco’s shaft than she had ever managed before. She felt Theo step up behind her and gave a muffled cry as he lined himself up, teased her with a couple of strokes through her folds then sheathed himself smoothly inside her. “Mmmphwampg,” she mumbled incoherently as he pulled almost all of the way out, then slid back inside, dragging himself against her at a maddeningly slow pace.  “What’s that, love? You want it harder? Faster? Ahh. I see. Like this?” Hermione’s eyes bulged, and her mouth opened even wider as Theo finally, finally, gave her what she wanted. He snapped his hips, pulling her back against him and making her cry out in relief. His punishing thrusts set her rhythm on Draco too, she closed her eyes and enjoyed the feeling of being trapped between them both in such a way. Draco moaned loudly, and this time when he tensed and lifted his hips a fraction, Theo only increased his speed. “Come. Now!” he commanded, “Oh  fuck! ”  She was almost embarrassed at how quickly he tipped her over the edge and into sweet oblivion. Theo gasped, digging his fingers into her hips and bottoming out inside her as he reached his own climax.  Draco gagged Hermione’s cries of pleasure, so she did the only thing she could and swallowed frantically until she was able to pull back enough to gasp a breath of cool, clean air. She collapsed forwards onto his lap, panting as wave after wave of molten pleasure continued to wash through her.  Theo caught his breath as he extracted himself. He lay down on the bed, guided her bottom down, and pulled her into his arms before she even realized she was moving. “Are you okay?” he asked breathlessly.  Unable to speak just yet, she nodded, feeling Draco move down the bed and snuggle against them both. “I still say you're a git, Theo. I only came in here for a jumper,” he gasped, rubbing his hands over his face then nuzzling Hermione’s shoulder.  Theo chuckled. “Call it an end of term bonus,” he said, gently tipping Hermione’s face up with his fingers. “Are you okay?” he asked, concern clouding his crystalline blue eyes. “Yes,” she said sleepily, “oh yes. Everything feels so much better now.” “Was it too much? Only you've said a couple of times that you wanted me to push things, and I was trying to read your thoughts. You didn’t safeword-” Hermione giggled. “This is why I love you so much, Theo,” she smiled, pressing a kiss to his lips. “You’re perfect. You're so dominant, and that turns me to mush all on its own, but then you’re always so concerned about us both as well. You're perfect. That was perfect. I mean, I’ll admit I felt frustrated in the Great Hall, especially the second time you nearly brought me off then didn’t, but I understand what you were doing now. That was amazing.” “Not too much?” Theo asked again, and she laughed. “No.” She snuggled further into his arms with a smile. “I will tell you if anything ever is, and I’m perfectly capable of using my safeword. I’ve never even come close to doing that with either of you.” “Good.” Theo sighed into her hair. “That umm, that calling you sir thing, and the submission stuff. Well, that came from Pansy earlier in the week. She said it would get you rather worked up.” “That little minx!” Theo grinned as he stroked tiny circles on Hermione’s arm, “It figures that came from her.” “Did it work? Did you like it?” “Couldn’t you tell?” Draco asked sleepily as Theo nodded and a silver panther streaked in through their bed hangings. “I hope you're not corrupting my Patronus,” Blaise’s voice said, “because I haven’t figured out how to blindfold it yet. Everyone’s in position. If you want to have this confrontation, now is the perfect time to do it.”
  
  

  
  
The panther dissolved into smokey vapor as Hermione sat up, suddenly wide awake and terrified. “It’s now or never then, love,” Theo said, standing up and picking up their discarded clothes. “Ready?” The common room was packed when Hermione opened the door. The atmosphere was rowdy, as it always was on the last day of term. At least three quarters of their year group appeared to be present. Hermione certainly had the captive audience she had hoped for.  Draco looked rather pale. He hesitated in the doorway, looking as though he too was considering bolting from the room at any moment. Theo just leaned back against the doorframe, surveying the room with an amused smirk. “Know what you’re going to say?” he asked, and Hermione turned her wide eyes onto him, shaking her head while earnestly wishing she’d thought of a different plan.  Her eyes darted around the crowded room. Everyone was in place, just as they had all promised they would be. Harry, Ron, Ginny, Pansy, Millie, Blaise, Greg, Hannah, Luna, Parvarti, Lavender, Dean, Seamus, and Neville. Hermione’s heart swelled, and for a moment she was almost overcome with gratitude to all of her friends for lending their support. She looked the other way, and her heart leapt at the sight of Tracy and Daphne, sitting with Cho Chang, Marrietta Edgecombe, and a couple of other Ravenclaw girls that they seemed to have befriended.  She held the pile of evidence to her chest, then took several deep, steadying breaths. She had everything she needed. She had the polyjuice photographs, both sets of original notes, and both of the boys copied rap sheets. She could see that Hannah was also holding several sheets of parchment in her hand.  Everything was ready. Everybody was in place, and all they were waiting for was her, but she was suddenly too terrified to move. Her mouth was as dry as parchment, and her voice died in her throat as soon as she tried to use it.  Theo squeezed her fingers, and she came back to herself. People were starting to look at them strangely, it really was now or never. She reminded herself of how distraught she had felt when she had found the notes. No matter what their reason had been for doing so, these girls had tried to split up the best relationship she had ever been in, and the mere thought of losing Draco and Theo had her breaking out in a cold sweat. She cleared her throat twice, but her voice was so weak it didn’t break through the chatter in the room. She saw Harry stand up and Theo look questioningly at her. “Would you rather I did it?“ he asked. She shook her head. “No. Thank you. Just get their attention for me, please, will you?” she asked, closing her eyes and forcing herself to focus.  Theo stuck his fingers in his mouth and gave a piercing whistle. “Alright, everyone, we need your attention for a few minutes,” he gestured with a small bow to Hermione, who stumbled blindly out into the center of the room.  As she stood drowning under the weight of her classmates' curious stares, the color drained from Tracy and Daphne’s faces. Tracy moved to stand up but Pansy stepped in front of her shaking her head with a satisfied looking smirk. Instead of running away, Hermione saw both girls look at each other in panic. Daphne gripped her wand tightly and Tracy pulled hers out of her bag, clutching it tightly in a shaking hand. “Yes,” Hermione said shakily as Draco put a reassuring hand on her back, “we know it was you.” She turned, took a deep breath, and began to address the room at large. “Several weeks ago, myself, Theo, Draco, Hannah, and Greg began receiving some very unpleasant notes.” She held up the first photograph of her, Theo, and Draco on the track that led into Hogsmeade. The common room gave a collective gasp at the angry red writing. “Death Eaters Whore.” “Hannah received one of these too,” she said grimly as Hannah unfurled her own photograph. Once the clamor of gossiping chatter had settled down, Hermione took a deep breath and continued. “A couple of weeks later, we found direct copies of Draco, Theo, and Greg’s Azkaban trial records pinned to our bed hangings. I won’t show those,” she gestured to the folded up parchment in her and Hannah’s hands, “after all, there's been enough publicity given to those already. Then, this Monday, I received the worst note of all. This,” she frowned, plowing on before she lost her nerve, “this  person  is not Theo.” She held up the moving photographs depicting the person who had polyjuiced into him kissing Astoria’s friend, then turned back to Daphne and Tracy. “We know who this is. We know you used Polyjuice Potion to make this photograph, and what's more, we know why you did it.”  Hermione broke off, looking around the room and trying to gauge people’s reactions. “Please don’t think I’m blinded by my feelings for him,” she said to a group of Hufflepuffs who were muttering mutinously to her left. “I have irrefutable proof that this is not what it looks like.” The Hufflepuffs still looked skeptical, as did most of the Ravenclaws in the room. It hurt Hermione to see the level of suspicion that people still viewed Theo and Draco with. “Daphne and Tracy were trying to split us up. They had a very good reason for needing our help, but instead of doing the decent thing and asking for it directly, they took this underhanded, despicable approach.” She turned back to Daphne. “You see, we know about Astoria’s curse. We know that you thought the only way to break it was for her to get engaged to an heir of a sacred twenty-eight family before her seventeenth birthday on New Year's Eve. We know you wanted to split us up so that she could throw herself at Draco, Theo, or Greg and beg them to save her life.” The entire room had fallen silent now. Daphne looked stricken, Tracy had her hands over her face, and despite all that they had done, Hermione’s heart softened. She had seen too much heartbreak and suffering over the course of the war to want to cause any more now. She dropped the stern tone from her voice and moved a step closer to the sofa they were sitting on. “You see, the sad thing is, you didn’t have to do it this way,” she said softly. “You could have just asked us for help. We would have found a better way of breaking the curse-” “There  is  no other way of breaking the curse!” Daphne shouted. Startled, Hermione jumped back away from her and bumped into Draco. “She’s my little sister, and she’s going to die, all because you,  you of all people, decided that one boyfriend wasn’t enough for you. You had to take them both like the brazen little hussy that you-” “I dare you to finish that sentence, Daph,” Hermione blinked as Draco stepped in front of her with his wand pointed directly at Daphne’s heart. “Go on, try me.” “You need to take Astoria to see Narcissa Malfoy in France,” Hermione said, eyeing Daphne’s hysterics with cool disdain. She will have the knowledge to break it for you. Yes, really, truly, she can break it. Theo’s father knows how to do it and we just went to see him so it’s all arranged. You didn’t need to bother trying to split us up. You just needed to take a trip to France.”  “Oh, close your mouth Trace. That’s not an attractive look,” Theo rolled his eyes. “You must have known my father would know what to do with a blood curse. You're well aware of what role he played in the Death Eater ranks. I thought we were friends. I trusted both of you, but now you both disgust me.” “You know,” Draco said, lowering his wand and stepping back, “for a while, I actually understood why you did this. It was brilliantly evil. It was sneaky as hell, and clever too, playing on all of our fears like that. When I was younger, I’d have probably been quite impressed with it. But the thing is, we grow up. We’re not those stupid, spiteful children anymore. We’re adults, and adults don’t treat each other like this. Theo hurt you Tracy. He was wrong and he apologized for that. Yet you still saw fit to do this?” Draco shook his head, “You disgust me too. You’re lucky Hermione is as nice as she is. You’ve got her to thank for my mother’s willingness to help you.” “Have you got anything else to say?” Hermione asked, looking at the two girls. Both of them now had the distinct look of people who had been cornered and knew there was no way back from what they had done. It seemed that they weren’t going down without a fight, however.  “Yes,” Daphne said, squaring her shoulders and flicking back her hair. “What would you have done? If it was your baby sister whose life was on the line? If there was only one thing you knew that could save her, you’d go for it, right? You’d try everything within your questionable powers to keep her safe. Wouldn't you?” “Of course I would,” Hermione said. “But I wouldn’t have done it this way. I’d have asked directly for help. I’d have been open with the people I trusted. The people who were supposed to be my friends.” Tracy sighed. “Of course  you  would. But we’re not all as  perfect as you.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” It was Pansy who flared up at Tracy’s tone, stepping forwards and shaking Harry off her arm. “”Questionable power?” “ perfect”,  said in  that tone? Why don’t you just say what you really mean and have done with it?” Daphne scowled. “She’s got you on her side too, hasn't she? It’s incredible how muggle borns do this, and yet nobody can see it these days!”    Pansy looked ready to explode. Sparks fizzed from her glossy hair, and despite the situation, Hermione smiled. Harry was watching Pansy closely, and the depth of his respect for her was written all over his expressive face. “Yes, Hermione has got us on her side, but that’s got nothing to do with her blood status,” Pansy said simply. “The ironic thing is, Daph, she’s a nice person. She would have helped you out without a second thought. There was no need for you to do any of this, so drop your bullshit. You had to know Theo’s father would be able to break a blood curse.” Pansy paused, her face contorting into a pained grimace at Daphne’s defiant look. “Oh, I get it now. That’s why you targeted him directly with the last set of pictures, isn’t it? You  did  know he could do it. We thought you were just playing on Theo’s appalling track record of cheating on people, but you actually targeted him so that Astoria could console him when Hermione and Draco dumped him, and therefore she would have the best shot at being cured. You fucking bitch!” Daphne froze as Pansy shook her head. “This campaign of yours had three points to it, didn’t it? Saving Astoria, revenge on Theo, and your own twisted idea of blood supremacy.” “Oh, come on!” Daphne shrieked, standing up and looking quite mad all of a sudden, “She’s got two of them, Pans!! She’s muggle born and she’s got the two most eligible men in the whole school wrapped around her little finger!”  “Get out of my sight,” Draco said, side stepping Pansy as she erupted into indignant screeching. He pointed his wand at Daphne once again, and for the first time in nearly four years, Hermione shivered, slightly afraid of the look on his face. It seemed that Draco still retained a lot of the menace he’d been so good at throwing around in their sixth year. He looked, quite frankly, mesmerizing as he stood at his full height with fire blazing in his stormy eyes. “Never, ever, mention my girlfriend's blood status in front of me, ever again.” He spun around and almost everyone in the room shrank back in alarm. “That goes for everyone here. Do you all understand me?” “That goes for me too,” Theo gave Draco an impressed look, then nodded. “My father will sort Astoria out because Hermione asked him to, and that, in my opinion, is a hell of a lot more than you all deserve. Narcissa will owl you in plenty of time to break the curse before Astoria comes of age. Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’re all going to bed.”  Theo spun around and stalked to the bedroom, with Hermione and Draco following closely behind. The door shut with a bang and Hermione abruptly burst into tears. “Hey. Hey,  hey! ” Draco said, pulling her into his arms and stroking her back gently. "You did it, sweetheart. You were amazing. It's all over now.” Hermione nodded, hiccupping and sobbing uncontrollably in Draco’s arms. “Come on, love. Draco’s right. It’s all over now.” Theo wrapped his arms around both of them and hugged them tightly. “As for you,” he added, looking at Draco over Hermione’s shoulder, “that was impressive. If I didn’t have you already, I’d be asking you out after that little speech!” Draco snorted. “I was only telling them the truth.” Theo looked impressed. “Yes, you were. But you’re sexy as fuck when your all riled up.” “Is this really the time for comments like that?” Draco asked, sounding incredulous, but Theo’s words had caused Hermione’s tears to abate into giggles and she sagged against Draco, suddenly aware of how exhausted she was.   “I need to go to bed,” she said, giggling again as Theo scooped her up and carried her bridal style over to the bed that was still mussed from their earlier tryst. 
  
    Chapter Text
    
  Hermione slept in late on Saturday morning. She finally woke to a pounding headache and a flood of uncomfortable memories competing for her mind’s attention. She groaned, reaching for Draco as she usually did first thing in the morning, but his side of the bed was empty. Suddenly worried, she felt the other way then breathed a sigh of relief as her hand bumped into Theo’s solidly reassuring bulk. “Morning,” he smiled, turning towards her in the half light. “It’s nice to wake up and get a cuddle with you. I’m normally on my own sleeping late on the weekends, while you and Draco do whatever morning people do.”
 
  “Hmm,” she mumbled, snuggling against his chest. "I'm not doing anything I don’t have to do today."
 
  Theo kissed the top of her hair. “Really? That’s not like you. What's wrong?”
 
  She gave a heavy sigh then relaxed her head into the crook of his arm. “Everything. Nothing. I just,” she broke off as Theo stroked her bed mussed hair away from her face, “I feel terrible for confronting the girls the way we did yesterday, especially given how the conversation ended. Do you think they're okay?”
 
  Theo frowned. “I couldn’t give a flying fuck, to be honest, but since you could, I happen to know they’re fine. Draco’s already given them Narcissa’s details, and they've sent her an owl. Their visit to France is being arranged as we speak.”
 
  “Thank you,” she said, closing her eyes in relief. “Thank you for… Oh, just thank you.” 
 
  Theo tightened his grip, squeezing her gently. “You're welcome. We’ve missed breakfast, by the way, and unfortunately, we have to get up soon. We have to floo away from school at twelve,” Theo frowned as he glanced at his watch. “Bugger, it’s gone ten now. Do you think Sirius or Remus will feed us instead?”
 
  “I'm pretty sure they will.” She rolled over, stretching out fully while relishing the thought of the Christmas holidays. “But I'm not ready to move just yet. Theo, tell me the truth. Do you think I’m too soft?” she asked suddenly, not entirely sure where the question had come from.
 
  Theo propped himself up on one elbow to look at her appraisingly. “I think you’re you,” he said after a moment's pause. “I think you're the exact level of softness that you're meant to be. You're more forgiving than Draco, and both of you have a lot more tolerance than I do. But surely you know that by now. Why do you ask?” 
 
  Hermione nodded, then rolled back against his chest, her eyes level with the clock and time-turner tattoo on his upper arm. The clock was set to a specific time, eleven thirty seven, and she idly wondered why that was as she mulled over his question. “Don't ever change love. You're perfect as you are. Perfect for me. Perfect for Draco too. I certainly don’t deserve either of you,” he added in a whisper.”
 
  Hermione stayed quiet for a moment longer, processing what he had just said. When she was certain that she had heard him correctly, she turned to face him, tracing her fingers along the black outline of the snake on his lower arm. She pressed its head then smiled, watching its tail trace it’s familiar path around his wrist. 
 
  “Why do you think that?” she asked softly, still following the outline of the snake with her finger. 
 
  Theo froze, his arm tensing under her fingers as he scrunched his face into a pained grimace. “Think what?”
 
  Hermione sighed. “You're such a contradiction, Theo. You're soft like me sometimes, usually when you're alone with the pair of us and your guard is down, and yet there are times when something annoys you, and your eyes flash fire, and I worry about what you might do. You hate the Death Eater movement, yet you chose to have this snake tattooed on your arm. There's something I'm missing. Will you trust me enough to tell me what it is?”
 
  To her surprise, Theo moved away from her in the bed then rubbed his hand over his face. Hermione frowned at his abrupt change in attitude, disliking the sudden feeling of detachment that he was giving off. She recognized the blank look in his eyes as an attempt at an occlumency guard, and she blinked away her surprise, trying to soothe the stab of pain that his rejection brought. “Didn’t you work it out when we visited my father?” he asked, staring moodily up at the ceiling.
 
  “No!” Hermione rolled her eyes as the bed hangings swished open, and Draco let himself into their bed space. “I didn’t.” She bit her lip, sitting up and hugging her arms around her knees, trying not to let her frustration show. She loved Draco very much, but sometimes his timing was appalling.
 
  “What's the matter?” Draco asked, instantly picking up the tense atmosphere.
 
  Theo groaned, swung his legs over the side of the bed then stood up. “Well, you've walked in at confession time, I’m afraid. Hermione wants to know why I think I don’t deserve you both, and it’s the same reason I don’t find it easy to let you see my vulnerable side. So, I guess you deserve an explanation, and now's probably a good time to tell you the truth." He stood up, then grabbed his dressing gown from the bedside chair, shivering in the cool morning air. "I won't blame you for walking away afterward, just so you know.”
 
  Draco eyed Theo speculatively until a frown of understanding crossed his face. “Drop it,” he said, his sharp tone edged with derision. “You won’t let me hide behind Occlumency, and yours is terrible anyway. Stop fucking about with mind shields, its just insulting when you're doing it to us.”
 
  Theo spun around to glare alarmingly at Draco. Hermione held her breath, but Draco just stared him down with a raised brow. Of the two of them, Draco had the slight height advantage and he used it well, seeming to swell over Theo, who to Hermione’s utter amazement sighed, then sank down to sit on the bed with his head in his hands. “I’ve lied to you, alright? Both of you. I’ve told you half of the truth a couple of times, hoping that you’d push me to say more, but you never did.”
 
  Draco stared at Theo in confusion. “I don’t think you have. Lied to me, I mean. I’m a pretty good Legilimens and usually I know when people are lying. I also know you very well. I don’t mean to sound conceited, but I’d be amazed if you’ve truly lied to me and gotten away with it.”
 
  Theo scoffed. He picked up his wand, using it to cast tiny, blue, everlasting sparks into the air. “Oh, come on, Malfoy. Wake up. I’ve half confessed this in the past, but you didn’t understand my meaning and I didn’t elaborate. I’ve said that if our roles had been reversed, I’d like to think that Lucius would have protected me the same way my father protected you.”
 
  “How is that a lie?” Hermione asked, feeling thoroughly confused by the whole conversation. 
 
  Draco seemed to understand Theo’s meaning perfectly well, however. He nodded, let out a long breath then rolled his eyes. “Ah,” he said. 
 
  “I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to hope-” Hermione continued, but Theo cut her off rather abruptly.
 
  “It’s a lie, Hermione, because Lucius wouldn’t have needed to do that,” he said. “My father took the fall for both of us that day in the manor. You couldn't cast the spells, Draco, but I could, and I did. Didn't you ever notice that the first flash of green light was rather intense?”
 
  “I might have done,” Draco said, his face unreadable as he watched Theo intently. 
 
  Theo refused to look anywhere other than at the steady stream of sparks that were still issuing from his wand. “The spells that killed the muggle men were my father’s. That was proven by the wand weighers at the Wizengamot. But I also shot a killing curse at the first guy myself. If I’d been a split second earlier with my casting, it would have been me that killed him. My father knew I was in love with you Draco. He guessed what I was going to do. He knew I was capable of it, and he figured I’d do it to save you. I was so affected by visiting him in Azkaban because no matter what you say, I 
  
    should
  
   be serving time alongside him. I got this snake tattoo to remind me of who I really am and of what I can do when I’m pushed.” He stood up then strode to the window while shaking his head sadly. 
 
  “I may not have been marked, but I’m no better than any of those who were.” He pressed the snake himself and watched its tail flick over his skin again. “Incidentally, the only reason I wasn’t marked was because my dad saved me from that, too. He said I was ill. He told a direct lie to the Dark Lord's face, and he fooled the king of mind magic in order to protect me. Now he's rotting away in prison, and it's all my fault.” 
 
  Hermione stood up, reaching out to take Theo’s hand, but he shook her off, and she looked helplessly at Draco while blinking back tears. “The whole arm tattoo is connected, though. The clock on my upper arm shows the time my mother died. The time turner is something I would love to have.” 
 
  Hermione’s hands flew to cover her mouth. She moved instead to stand next to Draco, who silently passed her his own dressing gown. She pulled it on gratefully then leaned into his chest, feeling her heart break a little more every time Theo spoke. “So would my dad. Do you know why he was in the Department of Mysteries the day of that battle, Hermione? He went along when the call came because he’d been trying to get inside there for years. He had no interest in the battle. He never lifted his wand against any one of you, but he got caught up in the fight anyway. He went because he wanted to steal a time turner, but they all got smashed, and he got knocked out by Luna. That, believe it or not, is how she and I became friends. She asked how he was afterward, and I, well, I couldn't bear letting her think that he was as bad as the others. So I told her why he was there. I told her he wanted a time turner to go back and to take away the potion my mum was trying to make, the one that went so wrong it killed her. At the time I didn't know that Luna's mum died in almost the exact same way.”
 
  Theo let out a long shuddering breath. He stared out of the window at the rainswept grounds for a long moment, then when nobody else spoke, he carried on. “I planned to use the time turner too, and Luna admitted that if she’d known what my father was really doing that day, she would have left him be. In fact, she said she would have helped him, if she could, and she would have used the time turner too. We all had plans. My father wanted to save my mum, Luna wanted to use it to save 
  
    her
  
   mum, and I wanted to use it to travel back to when we were fifteen and thought we ruled the world. Do you remember those days, Draco? Do you remember how naive we were back then? I’d change it all if I could.” 
 
  Almost completely overcome with her own tears, Hermione glanced sideways at Draco. His eyes were closed, and he was taking deep breaths in through his nose. “And that, in a nutshell, is why I don't deserve either of you,” Theo finally surmised. 
 
  “That's enough, now.” Draco spoke firmly, and Theo actually flinched at his tone. “Seriously, love, stop now. What do you say to me when I get in a self depreciating mood? How many times have you held me while I’ve cried in the night over the things I’ve done? How many times have you told me this does not define me?” He lifted his left arm and waved it in the air to show his own Dark Mark. “Where's all this come from today anyway?” Draco asked suddenly. “I left you here for a couple of hours, and you've suddenly seen fit to confess your darkest sins?”
 
  Theo turned to stare at Draco incredulously. “You don’t seem very surprised by any of them.”
 
  “I’m not,” Draco said. The only thing that’s surprised me is that you thought I didn’t know you’d taken a pop at that muggle yourself. I’m annoyed that I couldn’t shoot the damn spells myself. I put you and your dad in an impossible situation that day, and I’ve always known that if it had been you in my place, you’d have done it. I 
  
    know 
  
  that Theo. I’m not the least bit surprised that you took a shot at him. You always used to say that you'd protect me no matter what, and you did.”
 
  “But-” Theo opened his mouth but no words came out. Instead, he just closed it again then stared at Draco incredulously. 
 
  Draco rolled his eyes, looking at Theo with exasperated affection. “Since it seems like someone else's turn for a confession now, here’s mine. Rabastan Lestrange threw a confounding charm at you. That’s why your killing curse’s timing was off. I know because Rabastan is my uncle and he told me straight out. He did it to protect you. He's actually a nice guy, although not many people know that. He recognized the way you and I looked at each other and he made a guess as to what was going to happen in the circle that day. Our fathers weren’t the only ones trying to protect us, Greg, and Vince.”
 
  “
  
    You Knew?!
  
  ” Theo stared at Draco sharply, apparently shocked to his very core. “You knew what I did-”
 
  “Yes, I knew.” Draco stared back at him just as intensely. “I’ve always known. And while we’re on this subject, I figure that the reason you won’t let yourself be too vulnerable around either of us is because you feel some deep seated need to protect us both, or you think that you don’t deserve to be taken care of... Ah, that's the one then.” Draco nodded his understanding as Theo’s eyelids flickered. “You're a bloody idiot, Theodore. It’s about time you forgave yourself for all of this.” Draco strode around the bed to reach Theo then threw his arms around his neck. “Enough now. You and Hermione have helped me heal from my past horrors, now it’s our turn to help you.”
 
  Theo turned to gaze helplessly at Hermione, who was still standing by the bed. “That sounds like good advice,” she said quietly. Wiping her eyes she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around both Draco and Theo, holding onto them both tightly. For once, Theo actually let himself be held, so Hermione settled her head into the gap under his chin, resting her cheek against his chest as she listened to Draco softly telling them both that everything was going to be okay.



  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  An hour later, they finally made their way out into the rowdy common room.  There was hardly anywhere to stand. Everywhere they tried was already packed full of bulging trunks, owls, cats, toads, and gaggles of students wrapped up in their winter woollens, all waiting to go home for the Christmas holidays. 
 
  Looking around closely, Hermione frowned. It seemed to be mostly Gryffindors, Slytherins, and a few Hufflepuffs in the room, Tracy, Daphne, and their gang of Ravenclaws were nowhere to be seen. Hermione sighed, hoping that this wasn't a sign of new divisions forming, then smiled fondly as Trevor the toad hopped away from a flustered looking Neville. She made a rather inexpert grab for Trevor, which he dodged, and in doing so, landed squarely on Draco’s dragonhide boot.
 
  “Whoa, little guy!” Theo leapt forward, catching Trevor as Draco reflexively kicked his foot. “Easy, Malfoy, you’ll hurt him. Here, Nev, I’ve got him.”
 
  “Thanks,” Neville smiled in relief, took Trevor from Theo, then laughed at Draco’s disgruntled face. “Sorry about that, he... uh, he has a mind of his own.”
 
  “So I see!” Draco stepped hastily back as Trevor made yet another bid for freedom, then croaked in defeat as Neville hastily stowed him into his carrier. 
 
  “We won’t be seeing you in Care of Magical Creatures anytime soon then, Malfoy?” Seamus asked, smiling broadly as he crossed the room hand in hand with Dean.
 
  “No. Even without mutinous hippogriffs it’s not really my favorite subject,” Draco admitted, elbowing Theo in the ribs as he gave a loud laugh.
 
  “Listen, I just wanted to thank you for, you know, what you did for the pair of us, you know, with the game and everything,” Seamus said. “You got us together. I’d never have admitted I was queer if I hadn’t seen how well you both handled it. You too, Hermione, you’ve made a real difference to how people look at things around here.”
 
  “Thanks,” Theo said, looking pleasantly surprised. “I’m glad my belligerent attitude has its uses. See, Draco, we’re setting a good example for once in our lives. Isn’t that unusual?!”
 
  “Theo!” Luna called before Draco could answer. She waved as she drifted serenely out of the Gryffindor girls dorms with Parvarti by her side, “I thought you left without saying goodbye!”
 
  “As if I’d miss saying goodbye to you!” he exclaimed, pulling Luna into an easy hug. Luna embraced him tenderly in return, gazing so intimately into his eyes that Hermione, Parvarti, and Draco all exchanged an amused look. 
 
  “What's the matter?” Luna asked, pulling back and turning Theo’s head from side to side, examining him closely and in apparent concern. “Your thoughts seem to be very confused,” she put both of her hands on Theo’s cheeks and stared deeply into his eyes once again. 
 
  “If anyone else had hold of him like that, I’d hex them into dust,” Draco muttered in Hermione’s ear, and because it was Luna, and because she knew exactly what Draco meant, Hermione laughed. 
 
  “Ah,” Luna said, nodding wisely then releasing Theo, who looked at her expectantly. “It’s what I saw in my crystal ball this morning. I told you about it, didn’t I Parvarti? Being truthful can be a little scary, but it's worth it in the long run.” She patted Theo on the arm, leaving him looking thoroughly bemused, then turned to beam at Draco. “Thank you for being so kind to him. You too, Hermione. Just so that you know, Parvarti and myself are pulling out of the game,” she added as an apparent afterthought. “We’re really quite happy together, and we don’t want to be competing with the other couples anymore. But,” she grinned brightly, her face a picture of happiness, “thank you for encouraging me to play, and to get comfortable with myself. I’m so glad to have met Parvarti properly. Happy Christmas!” She grabbed Theo once again, kissed him on both cheeks, then paused in front of Draco as if considering him. Draco lifted his eyebrows, and as if that was the signal she had been waiting for, Luna did the same thing to him, and then to Hermione as well.
 
  Theo pressed his fingers to his cheek, watching with a smile as Parvarti gave them all a wave then hurried away with Luna. “Us, Millie, Greg, and Blaise. Four pairings. Thats all thats left playing-”
 
  “Three, I’m afraid. We’re out too,” Greg said, holding out his hand as he and Hannah approached. Theo shook it with a lifted brow. “We agree with what Finnigan said a minute ago, except for the coming out part, of course. And also, it’s as Lovegood said. We don't want to compete over the holidays.”
 
  “Well, we’re not bowing out,” Blaise said, clapping Theo on the back. “We’re coming with you to Grimmauld, and what’s more, we’re competitive to the very end. So, if you three, Millie, and Ron are still playing, then so are we.”
 
  “Are we ever?!” Theo asked. “Fine, you're on, I was going to do a quick impromptu meeting before we left. With all the drama that's been going on lately, I’ve completely forgotten to give out this week’s theme. But, if it’s just us, we can do it tonight instead.”
 
  Blaise grinned, a wicked glint in his chocolate brown eyes. “Bring it on then, Nott. Do you want me to bring my tattoo gun?”
 
  “Hell yeah!” Theo nodded as Professor Mcgonagall appeared in the doorway to oversee the students flooing home. “I’ll grab the Cupid Cards. You get that and we’ll see you in the haunted house a bit later on.”
 
  
    Chapter Text
    Grimmauld Place’s patio was bustling with activity. Hermione paused in the doorway, blinking to let her eyes adjust to the magical lighting, then glanced at Harry’s watch, noting with surprise that it was almost seven o’clock in the evening. She had closeted herself away after lunch, hoping for an afternoon of much needed solitude, but the quiet room had led her to fall asleep, and she had only recently woken up when Harry had come looking for her.  Remus stood up to greet her, and she stepped forwards into his embrace, closing her eyes as she rested her head on his chest. She breathed in, grounding herself with his familiar scent, but after a moment, she furrowed her brows in confusion. A prickle of something different, something quite intoxicating, was tickling her nostrils, and she remembered that they were less than twenty four hours away from the full moon. “Are you feeling better?” Remus asked, moving back to study her appraisingly. “Yes, thank you,” she said, trying not to stare into his newly amber flecked eyes. His eyelids closed self consciously as she glanced curiously at the sky, and she squeezed his arm reassuringly. “It's okay,” she whispered, “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to stare. I think I’m still half asleep.” Remus nodded then passed her on to Ginny’s enthusiastic embrace. “Honestly, I promise I’m fine,” she laughed as Ginny exaggerated giving her a checkover, looking behind her ears, then examining the undersides of her hair. “Thank you all for your support last night, by the way, and thank you in particular, Pansy. I really appreciated how you stood up for me, especially given that those girls used to be your friends.” “No problem,” Pansy said with a grim smile. “They may have been my friends once, but they’re certainly not now.” She broke off to smile at Harry, who had just squeezed her hand, “for what it's worth, I think you dealt with them pretty well yourself. I was just happy to offer backup." “Kitten!” Sirius exclaimed, backing onto the patio with a heap of what appeared to be engine parts held tightly in his arms. He tipped them into a clattering heap on the table, ignored Remus’ raised eyebrows, then turned to hug Hermione himself. “I hear you had an eventful evening?” “That’s one way of describing things,” she admitted. ”What  are  you doing?” “The bike’s playing up,” Sirius sighed, carding a hand through his long hair and inadvertently leaving a streak of grease across his cheek with his thumb. “I’m trying to fix it so we can use it at Charlie’s tomorrow. Are you feeling alright, Re?” Remus nodded. “You might want to-” he indicated the dark smudge on Sirius’ cheek, but Sirius merely grinned then waved his grimy hands through the air.  “Can't love, I’ll make it worse. You’ll have to get it for me.”  Hermione’s heart thumped in her chest as Remus leaned across the table. There was definitely something different about him today. His posture had changed, and his demeanor was just slightly more…. she bit her bottom lip while wondering how best to describe it, then tried not to stare as he gently swiped his fingers over Sirius’ face. “That’s better,” he admitted, pausing to drop a soft kiss onto Sirius’ mouth. Sirius merely grabbed Remus’ t-shirt and pulled him closer. Hermione couldn’t help giving a soft gasp, even as Ginny’s whistle and Harry’s disgruntled cough caused Remus to pull back sheepishly. Blushing, Hermione caught Pansy’s eyes, and both of them giggled while Sirius ruffled Harry’s hair affectionately. The tension of the moment was broken by Blaise, Theo, Millie, and Ron who had all just stepped out onto the patio.. “Hello, love,” Theo greeted Hermione with a kiss, then sat down beside her while Ginny made room on the swing hammock for Blaise. “How are you feeling now?” “A lot better, thanks,” she admitted. “I think I just needed to catch up on sleep.” “Yes, I would imagine you were  thoroughly exhausted after what I overheard yesterday,” Blaise teased.  “Good evening, finally!” Draco exclaimed, also emerging onto the magically heated patio, dragging his school trunk and abandoning several layers of winter clothing on his way. He stared at the case of wine bottles on the floor next to the table and raised a brow. “Did you all start drinking without me?”  “Not yet,” Remus said, waving his wand to conjure a set of wildly colored wine glasses onto the table.  Sirius burst out laughing as he reached for a bottle. “Magic acting up already, is it, love?” Remus blinked at the psychedelic glasses, shook his head then raised his wand again. “Leave them like this. I like them.” He popped the cork with a wandless spell, then started pouring before Remus had a chance to object.    “Thank you,” Hermione said, accepting her sunshine yellow glass with a smile. “What kept you at school for so long?” “Arranging my extra credit project with Slughorn and Mcgonagall,” Draco explained, smiling incredulously at his own pink and orange glass. “Thanks. I had to run everything by them because I want to study the unforgivable curses. I got permission, though.” He grimaced as he skirted the greasy engine parts that Ron was now examining, then sank into the unoccupied chair between Pansy and Millie. “I only wanted to study them to see if I could find a block for them, but Slughorn said that if I can find something that looks promising, he can arrange for us to test it out in an aura lab. I was stunned.”  “That’s brilliant, sweetie,” Pansy smiled. “Didn’t I tell you that when you stopped being an evil, brooding villain, you’d change the world?” She stood up and patted Draco on the head, making him stare at her incredulously. “I’d better check the dinner now you’ve all deigned to join us. Gin, can you give me a hand?”  “Can you throw in an extra steak, please, love? For Remus? Only it’s the moon tomorrow, hence these rather majestic glasses, and he’ll need the extra protein,” Sirius said, using his wand to scourgify the grimy piece of metal in his hand. Remus looked at the glasses again, then rolled his eyes. “Sunshine colors. As you can see, I’m not overjoyed by the thought of the impending full moon.” Pansy nodded, hesitating in the doorway. “What are we doing tomorrow night? Tonight too, in fact? Only, I don’t mean to be rude, but I don’t know how this works.” Sirius stared at her appraisingly. “You're not being rude at all. As long as people have an open mind, we’re quite happy to talk about it. Tonight’s fine. You’ll stay here, and we’ll remember to use a silencing spell. Tomorrow night you'll be staying at Charlie Weasley's dragon sanctuary. I promised to take Theo there to meet Buckbeak the hippogriff, and Charlie said you could all bunk down there for the night. You're welcome back here Monday morning, just as soon as it's light.” “Right,” Pansy said, looking relieved. “Thanks. Umm, last question then, why will you need a silencing spell tonight?” Sirius threw his head back, laughing while Remus closed his eyes and sank lower in his chair, muttering about incorrigible husbands. Harry also hid his face in his hands, making Pansy frown in further confusion. “I’m hoping for a good night. If they don’t die of embarrassment first, almost turned werewolves are extremely sexual,” Sirius said, turning back to the table with a chuckle and inadvertently dripping rusty water onto Remus on the way. In reply, Remus gave a low growl that made the hairs on the back of Hermione’s neck stand up. Pansy scuttled away at the menacing sound, and Ginny laughed as she followed her inside. “Merlin, you lot startle easily,” Sirius laughed, patting Remus on the shoulder. Remus frowned, cleaning his jeans with a wave of his wand. “I’m going to lie down for a bit. I’m exhausted already,” he said.   “Alright, love,” Sirius agreed, watching Remus protectively as he stood up. “So when he actually transforms,” Theo asked, once the door had fallen closed once more, “what happens? Do you stay with him, or is that not safe?” “It’s perfectly safe nowadays,” Sirius said, passing more engine parts to Ron. “Although safety concerns never stopped us even when it wasn’t. The wolfsbane he takes renders him almost completely docile. Personally, I miss the days when it was all a bit more exciting.” “Sirius!” Hermione exclaimed, sipping her wine, “are you ever going to lose your attraction to danger?!” “I very much hope not,” Sirius grinned. “Are you telling me that none of you would have enjoyed running wild in the Forbidden Forest with a fully grown werewolf beside you? I bet you would, Harry. It’s in your genes if nothing else.” “Maybe,” Harry conceded with a smile. “Assuming I was an animagus myself, of course.” Sirius saluted him with his glass. “Spoken like Prongs’ true son,” he said, and Harry nodded to accept the toast.  “I reckon I’d have quite liked that too,” Theo said with a grin. “Though I can’t see it being Draco’s idea of a good night, nor you either, B. I’m holding you to that promise you made, by the way, Sirius. I want to learn about the animagus process.  Sirius nodded, raising an eyebrow at Ron and Millie, who were now slotting all the newly serviced engine parts back together. “No problem. I’ll help you do it if you like. It's not easy, but it's worth it. I miss running with James and Remus, the wind blowing through Padfoot's fur, running like we’d never tire, and the full moon shining in the sky above us. Remus was alway deliciously feral for a couple of days before and after the moon too, much more so then than now. Unfortunately wolfsbane takes the edge off of  everything .” Sirius laughed as Harry grimaced once more.  “When we were seventeen, he bit me for the first time. Not like  that ,” Sirius grinned at Millie, Blaise, and Draco’s matching gasps of horror. “It was just a mate claiming bite. Here. Look.” He pulled his t-shirt to one side and showed them a raised silvery scar at the base of his neck that was artfully disguised by the ear of a tattoo wolf. “Since then, the moon’s always affected me a tiny bit too.” “I never knew that!” Harry exclaimed, voicing Hermione’s thoughts. “Can I see?” Theo asked, leaning across Hermione as Sirius obligingly pulled his shirt further out of the way. “Wow, a real werewolf bite. Does it hurt?” “A mate claim bite,” Sirius clarified, “not a real bite. Remus’ real one looks quite different, even now. It’s on his hip, and it still pains him to this day. Occasionally, when he’s in a good mood, I get him to redo this one, it does hurt initially, but then, well, the feeling becomes indescribable.”   “Stop it, Theo.” Draco narrowed his eyes, “I can see your mind working from here. We are  not  staying here tomorrow night to see what happens!” “That’s a shame.” Theo pulled a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket, lit one then tossed the slightly squashed box onto the table.  “The change isn’t quite as dramatic as it used to be either.” Sirius chuckled, taking one himself and lighting it with a showy finger click. “It’s less painful for him now too, which is, of course, the good side of Wolfsbane. Remus would never let you see his change anyway. I’ve only ever seen it once or twice. The first time I witnessed it I was so stunned that I forgot to transform into Padfoot. He almost caught me and that was the closest we’ve ever come to having a…..  mishap.  To this day he tells me I’m too reckless about it all.  ”  Blaise nodded while helping himself to a cigarette. “It’s incredible what you all used to do,” he said, looking awed. Sirius nodded, “Yeah, it was,” he smiled sadly.    “You  are  too reckless with it all,” a silver wolf streaked out through the closed patio door and spoke with Remus’ deep voice. Millie yelped as the wolf faded away, and Remus himself apparated back onto the patio. “How am I supposed to sleep if you’re all talking about me? Razor sharp senses, remember?” He pointed to the almost full moon in the sky.  “Nice teeth,” Sirius said with a smirk. Hermione sucked in a breath as Remus ran his tongue over his already visibly extended canines. He lifted his lip in a playful snarl, and Hermione clenched her thighs together involuntarily. Sirius was right. The pheromones Remus was currently giving off were potent.  Remus picked up Sirius’s wand, then used it to cast his wolf patronus again, and Hermione grinned as it jumped on Sirius of its own accord. Sirius took his wand back, then seconds later the wolf was joined by a shaggy silver dog. Sirius looked at Harry appraisingly then offered him the wand too. “Go on, son, try it,” he said quietly, and Harry hesitantly cast his stag patronus into the expectant night.  Hermione held her breath, watching the majestic animal toss its head. It stood still for a moment as if assessing its surroundings, then it stamped its foot and charged the dog who play-bowed in delight and leapt out of the way at the last possible moment. The wolf stood watching proudly until the dog leapt on top of it and the pair of silvery patronuses rolled over and over in the muddy grass. After a moment of silent watching, the stag used it’s antlers to butt the two canines apart, and all three patronuses charged down the courtyard garden together.  “Wow!” Remus said softly. Hermione wiped away a tear as Remus stepped around the table, coming to stand behind Sirius, who leaned his head back against his chest. “That brings back some memories.” “Dinner’s going to be half an-.” Ginny stuttered to a halt in the doorway, watching the patronuses frolic playfully in the muddy flowerbeds.  Pansy bumped into Ginny, steadied herself, then stared at Harry with her mouth open wide. “Is that your….? Oh, Harry, it's so beautiful!”  Ginny’s eyes narrowed as she noticed the cigarette in Blaise’s hand, but to Hermione’s immense surprise, rather than telling him off, Ginny just gave him a disapproving look then slid her eyes back to the patronuses. “Merlin, you're a braver man than me, Blaise. I used to fall to pieces under that look,” Harry joked, still looking emotional as the wolf, the stag, and the dog completed another lap of the garden.  Ginny spun on Harry with a withering glare. “So you can handle Pansy but not me? Is that what you're saying, Harry James Potter?!” Despite Ginny’s attempts to look stern, she couldn’t manage it for long, the exuberant patronuses charged past her and she laughed as the wolf pinned the dog to the ground and the stag flipped the wolf into the air. “Come and sit down, Gin,” Blaise said, patting the seat beside him, and for the first time that Hermione could ever remember seeing, Ginny willingly did as she was told. “In a straight choice between facing the Dark Lord for a second time, or dealing with a woman’s righteous ire,” Theo asked, squinting at Harry thoughtfully, “which would you choose?” Harry sipped his wine then licked his lips. “A woman. Unless that woman happened to be Ginny or Hermione, then I’d take Voldemort everytime!” “Good Godric, Harry!” Sirius shook his head. “Did you channel James’ entire spirit into producing that patronus? That’s exactly the kind of thing he’d have said once upon a time!” “And Lil’s would have hexed him into next week for it too,” Remus said, smiling sadly. “Don’t ever change, Harry, will you?” Harry smiled as Pansy sat down and slipped her hand into his. “I’m not going to. For the first time in my life, there’s nothing I actually want to change,” he said, leaning forward to accept Pansy’s gentle kiss.

   


 “How drunk are you, Hermione?” Draco asked later that evening.   “Not very. I wasn’t really in the mood to drink much tonight.” She frowned, not wanting Draco to worry about her. “I’m fine. Honestly. You don’t need to be concerned, I think I just needed a quiet day to recover from all the madness that's been happening lately. Why do you ask?”  “I just wondered,” he admitted, pulling off his hoodie and dropping it in a heap on the floor. “We have something in mind, and Theo wants me to be the one to ask you about it, but I only want to mention it if you're sober enough to give me a proper, informed answer.” “Okay,” she said slowly, picking up his abandoned clothing with a smile. Theo was usually the untidy one, not Draco. “I'm easily sober enough for that. How drunk are  you ?” “Slightly. Enough to bring this subject up,” he replied, looking at her with a  hopeful grin. She took a deep breath, bracing herself for whatever Draco was likely to say. “Go on then. What does Theo want you to ask me? Oh….. ohhhh....”  Draco’s kiss was hot and desperate. He tangled his fingers into her hair, pulling her close, nudging his thigh between her legs and rubbing against her core until she gasped. “Even the thought of it is doing funny things to me,” he admitted, pulling back to press a trail of kisses along her jaw. She tipped her head back to encourage him, mewling as his hands wandered underneath her clothes. “The thought of what?!” She laughed. “Oh, sweet Circe, what is it you….. and Theo….oh!..... want to…. mmmmph…..do?” “If you don’t want to, it’s fine,” Draco said breathlessly, walking her backward until the back of her knees bumped into the bed. She tumbled down, dragging him boldly down on top of her. “We don’t have to-” “Tell me!” Her words turned into a heated squeal as Draco pulled her top off then undid her bra with a deft flick of his wrist. She mewled loudly as he flung both garments out of the way then sucked her already throbbing nipple into his mouth. She arched her back off the bed, lifting herself up to meet him, gasping as he gently nipped her sensitive bud with his teeth. “More,” she gasped, writhing desperately against him, “do it a little harder.” “Like this?” She cried out as his teeth bit down more firmly, just hard enough to add an extra, delicious thrill to her arousal, and she wrapped her legs around his hips, pulling him closer still. “Yes…. Oh! Just like that.” She hurriedly undid his belt, and he backed off to slide his trousers and boxers down his legs while she hastily divested herself of her own. She palmed his already rock hard erection, feeling him twitch against her fingers as she stroked him. As soon as she released him, he lined himself up to her entrance, then paused to slide his weeping head along her slit, teasing her as he coated himself liberally in her juices.  “How are you so wet already?” he marveled, and she blushed, not willing to tell him that she had been that way most of the evening. Draco raised a brow anyway, and her blush deepened as she realised how loudly she had shouted her thoughts. “I never knew werewolf musk was so potent,” he chuckled. “Don’t be embarrassed, love. Blaise already told me Ginny’s feeling the same way. Can I?” Breathlessly she nodded, crying out as he sheathed himself inside her in one fluid motion. “Oh…. gods, love!” he gasped, dropping his head onto her shoulder. She shuffled forwards on the bed, wrapping her legs around his hips once more. “I can’t…hold back,” he grunted. “I can’t do it softly tonight…. I need…. oh  fuck! ”  “I don’t want it soft!” she panted. “Let go, Draco. Fuck me like Theo does.” Draco stared at her for a second, then nodded, and she cried out, pulling him closer as he thrust frantically into her over and over again. He was merciless in his assault, and she came as hard as she ever had, digging her nails into his back and chanting his name like a mantra, dragging him over the edge and into sweet oblivion with her.  Eventually, Draco collapsed weakly on top of her. When she had caught her breath and his weight had lifted off of her chest again, she looked up to see him propped up on one elbow, smiling down at her in wonder. “Hi,” he whispered, brushing her hair out of her eyes. “Sorry, I got a bit carried away. I think the moon’s having a funny effect on all of us tonight. Are you okay?” “Please don't apologize,” she whispered. “I like it that way. Well, I like it both ways actually, hard and soft, from both of you. Now, what was it you wanted to ask me?” “Oh. Yeah.” To her amusement, given all that they had just done, Draco flushed. “Where’s Theo when you need him?” “Probably still downstairs, drinking with Sirius,” she grinned. “But you said that you need to be the one to ask me this. Don’t worry, though, because I’m not so good with the dirty talk myself.” Draco grinned. “I’m not bad at it, Theo just puts me to shame because he takes it to another level. He wants me to talk to you about this because he thinks I’ll put it more delicately than he would.” Draco was still sheathed inside her, and when he moved his hips in shallow thrusts she hummed with softly renewed pleasure. “We want to know how you would feel about taking us both together. At the same time. One of us in here,” he thrust gently for emphasis, “and one of us in your pretty little arse.” Hermione's eyes widened as her insides contracted with an intense surge of white hot lust. Draco bit his lip, chuckling as her walls pulsed and he slipped out, landing stickily on her thigh. “I know we’ve mentioned this in the past, and you’ve always seemed quite interested, but I’m really asking you about it now. Is it something we could try? We’d build up to it slowly, obviously.”  She nodded, squirming against him with her heart racing at the mere thought. “Yes, it is. I’d like that very much indeed.”  Draco looked intensely relieved. “So if I was to do this….” he stroked his fingers through her folds, collected some of their combined juices, then moved his fingers lower until he was touching her back entrance, “would that be okay?” She shivered, mesmerized by his quicksilver eyes. “That would be more than okay,” she admitted shyly. “In fact, I was hoping that one of you would suggest this. I’ve been curious about it for a while.”  Draco nodded, still stroking her gently. The area was sensitive, and every stroke of his fingers made her skin tingle in newly exciting ways. She squirmed under his hand, seeking something more, although she wasn't entirely sure what, and missed his touch as soon as he moved his hand away.  “You like that?” he asked, now rubbing her clit gently between his finger and thumb. She gasped, her eyelids falling closed as she hummed her agreement. Draco’s skillful fingers worked her back into a frenzy in an almost embarrassingly short stretch of time. He moved back to her bottom, and she adjusted her hips to give him better access. “Hold tight, little cleaning and lubrication spell coming up. It feels a bit strange when you’re not used to it.” Draco whispered an incantation that she’d heard him and Theo use on each other, and she yelped as her back passage filled with a cool, tingly sensation. “Alright?” he asked, kissing her softly. She nodded, her eyes opening wide as he pressed the very tip of his finger inside her. “Relax, sweetheart,” he whispered, and she consciously exhaled, closing her eyes as he kissed her again then pushed his finger past her tight ring of muscle.  It felt strange. It wasn’t exactly unpleasant, but she wasn’t getting a great deal of immediate pleasure from it either. Draco’s thumb found her still pulsing clit, and she sighed in relief as he began to massage it again. Her orgasm started to build once more, and as Draco moved his finger inside her, she adjusted fully to the new sensation.  Draco twisted his hand, moving his thumb away from her clit and sliding it up inside her until he found the bundle of nerves that always caused her to detonate. “Just let me… ah.... there it is.” He found the same swollen spot with his finger, and as he started to gently massage it from both sides, Hermione gasped. “Ohhhhhhh!” She whimpered, tensing her thighs and bracing herself on the bed. All of a sudden, everything felt indescribable. She lifted her hips, overcome by the rush of bliss that had appeared from nowhere. Draco pressed fractionally harder, and an intense orgasm crashed over her, causing her to shatter into what felt like a million pieces.  Draco massaged her rhythmically as she rode her climax out, then gently withdrew his fingers. She relaxed limply onto the bed, letting her eyes close once more. “Are you alright, sweetheart?” he whispered, pressing a kiss to her temple. Breathlessly she nodded. “Yes.” “You liked that?” Slowly, she nodded once more.  “Think what it’ll feel like when it’s not just Draco’s fingers doing that. Imagine how both of our cocks will feel, sliding in and out of you, squeezing that little G Spot until you come so hard you squirt all over us.”  Hermione smiled without opening her eyes. “Hi, Theo. How long have you been standing there?” “Long enough to see most of what just happened,” he answered in a slightly strained voice. “Draco, you need to do something to me right now because if you don’t, I think I’m going to come in my pants.” Draco laughed as Hermione gathered enough energy to move up the bed. “Hi!” she whispered. “Hi,” Theo replied, leaning down to kiss her languidly.  “Drop your pants then, Nott, and lean over the bed.” Theo laughed softly, turning his face away from Hermione to accept Draco’s kiss. He nodded once in reply to Draco’s silent question, then did exactly as he’d been asked. Hermione moved into the position Draco gestured her to and took Theo’s hard cock in her hand. It was an exact reversal of the way they had done things the previous week, and she shivered with excitement, stroking Theo gently while waiting until he and Draco were ready.  “Are you alright?” she asked.  “Yes,” Theo replied, bracing his weight on his arms as he kissed her. Hermione smiled. As much as she loved being with one of the boys alone, being with Draco and Theo together was what excited her the most. Theo deepened their kiss, sweeping his tongue over hers and boldly claiming ownership of her mouth the way he always did. He tasted of firewhisky and smoke and  Theo,  and she wrapped her arms around him, overcome with surprise that he was actually following through on what they had talked about that morning. She’d never seen Draco take him quite like this, and she knew it must be taking a lot for Theo to let things happen this way.  She felt the moment Draco entered him, Theo stilled, then moaned softly, and when he nodded, she took the head of his cock into her mouth, stroking the parts she couldn’t swallow with her hand. As usual, when they were in this position, most of the work was done for her. Each one of Draco’s thrusts pushed Theo forwards into her mouth, then as he pulled back, she gasped a hurried breath. After a few moments, she felt Theo’s fingers brush her cheek and she released him with a pop. Draco paused, gesturing her to move up the bed, then, when she was settled, Theo parted her still slippery folds and slid smoothly inside her. “Can’t do it… can you…. love?” Draco panted. “Topping from the bottom…. is still topping... you know?” Theo just grinned, but he let Draco set the pace with his thrusts. Draco groaned as he sped up, gasping and plunging into Theo with everything he had. “Come. Now.'' It felt strange to hear Draco say that, but the words were no less effective coming from him. Hermione felt herself lift into the stratosphere for the third time that night, and as Theo came apart inside of her, Draco gave a long moan and everyone stilled as he poured his release deep inside Theo.  “Oh… my…. Gods!” Theo gasped, eventually lifting himself off of Hermione and laying down beside her. That was incredible. You two are full of surprises tonight.”  “Well,” Draco grinned, tugging at the duvet and tapping Theo’s thigh until he moved over, “I quite like being in charge every now and then.” He grinned as he kissed Theo squarely on the mouth, “As much as you’ll let me get away with, anyway!” “It's a good thing I don't like being in charge really, isn't it?” Hermione giggled, sliding between the cold sheets and settling down in Theo’s arms.  “Yep,” Theo agreed. “Anyway, what are you muttering about Malfoy, as much as I'll let you get away with? I think I did pretty well there!” “You did, love, you really did.” Draco snuggled up to Hermione on her other side and she nestled into the pair of them, feeling thoroughly cocooned and protected from the world. 



  
    Chapter Text
    
  “I hate doing this, I really hate doing this,” Hermione said, releasing Remus from her goodbye hug. “Are you sure there is nothing we can do to help?”
 
  “There’s nothing else that can be done, Kitten. Believe me, if there was, we’d have found it by now,” Sirius said firmly.
 
  “But!” Hermione wrung her hands desperately as Remus gave her a patient smile, “I just hate the thought of what you’ve got to go through!" 
 
  “It’s alright, Hermione,” Remus said. “I’ve done this lots of times before, and I daresay I’ll do it plenty more times in the future. Now come on, leave me be, just in case anything untoward happens. Sirius, we need to get home now. It's risky leaving it this late.”
 
  “I’ll look after him, I promise. I always do,” Sirius said.
 
  “Oh!” Feeling somewhat emotional, Hermione flung her arms back around Remus’ neck then let him go with a pained sigh. “I know you will. We’ll see you tomorrow morning then.”
 
  “Yep.” Remus gave her one last squeeze, shook Theo and then Draco’s hands then stepped up to Sirius. “Can you apparate us home, please? My magic’s all over the place right now.”
 
  Sirius nodded, wrapped his arms around Remus, ruffled his sandy blonde hair, and the pair of them disappeared with a single loud pop. 
 
  “Come on,” Theo said, draping his arm around Hermione's shoulders. “Sirius is right. There’s no use fretting about what's going to happen. Besides, Charlie said we could fly up with him to count the dragons into their nests. Everyone else is going and it might take your mind off of things. Whose broom do you want to fly on?”
 
  In the end, Hermione settled herself comfortably onto Draco’s broom, leaving Theo free to fly next to Charlie, who had offered him a personal tour of the dragon roosts. “Honestly, those two have been inseparable all day,” Draco said, grinning as Theo kicked off while still listening intently to Charlie. “Ready?” he asked, and Hermione nodded, feeling the bottom drop out of her stomach as Draco shot up into the sky. 
 
  “It is so beautiful here,” she said, squinting out into the rapidly fading sunset. The dragon sanctuary was massive. It covered several hundred acres of wild Welsh coastline and was thoroughly disguised from prying eyes by a host of secrecy spells and a large sign that read “Ministry of Defence, Combat Training Land - Strictly No Admittance.” Hermione settled back against Draco as they flew over barren looking moorland, the edge of an enormous pine forest, and then onwards towards the sparkling blue ocean. 
 
  “I’ve got you,” Draco tightened his arms around her as the land came to an abrupt end, and they flew out over the inky black shallows. 
 
  “I know,” she replied as Charlie and Theo turned, flying north alongside the jagged black cliffs. Draco shadowed them, as did Harry who was flying on their right with his arms around Pansy. Ron and Millie followed, but Blaise and Ginny, who were both flying on Ginny's broom, didn't. Hermione glanced back at her friends and smiled, the reason they were somewhat uncharacteristically bringing up the rear suddenly became clear. They were both paying far more attention to the passionate kiss they were sharing than to their rather erratic flying. Hermione opened her mouth to call them but Charlie beat her to it, and Hermione chuckled to herself as Ginny blushed and hurriedly swung the broom around. 
 
  They flew for what felt like miles, until the tie dyed sky glowed impossibly bright all around them and the sun finally dipped down below the horizon. “Theo’s never going to want to leave here, is he?” Draco asked, turning his head to watch him fondly.
 
  “I wouldn’t think so,” Hermione agreed. “I mean, he’s not that keen on school in the first place, is he? Does it ever scare you, Draco?” 
 
  “Does what ever scare me?” Draco asked, pressing his nose into her hair then kissing  the side of her face softly.
 
  Hermione stared into the gathering dusk with a sigh, trying to find the right words to convey her thoughts. “Your feelings?” she clarified eventually. “I mean, I’ve been with you and Theo for eight weeks, but I feel so strongly for you both that it feels a lot longer than that. It feels as if we’ve always been together, which is madness, given our history. Sometimes I find it all a little overwhelming.”
 
  “It absolutely terrifies me,” Draco admitted, resting his chin on her shoulder. “It’s amazing, but yes. If anything happened to either of you, or if one or both of you decided to leave me, I don’t think I’d ever recover.”
 
  Hermione nodded, feeling tears prick behind her eyelids. “I won’t leave you.”
 
  “Good,” Draco said, nuzzling his face into her hair once more. “And I won’t leave you either. I doubt Theo’s going anywhere, since I happen to know that he’s got the same concerns as us. So really, I think we all feel the same, wait a sec, where’ve they all gone now?”
 
  “They’ve landed over there, look!” Hermione pointed to a large overhanging cliff ledge and Draco swooped around to land beside Harry. 
 
  “Sit down. It’s almost time,” Charlie said, gesturing to the ground with his hand and Hermione settled herself on the damp grass between Draco and Theo. “We’ve timed this perfectly, another couple of minutes and the dragons will fly in to roost for the night,” Charlie continued while staring up into the sky, "any minute now, in fact."
 
  Hermione grimaced as moisture from the wet, cold ground started to seep through her jeans. She followed Charlie’s gaze, looking up into the rapidly darkening sky, but was somewhat relieved to find it still dragon free. “Where exactly will they be roosting?” Blaise asked, sounding just as nervous as Hermione felt.
 
  “In the fissures and caves in the rocks. Down there, look.” Charlie glanced around as Ginny answered the question for him. “Charlie used to bring me up here when I was younger,” she explained. “We’re quite safe here. Have you got the bag of meat, Charlie?”
 
  “Yep,” Charlie grinned, holding up a large duffle bag with a gleam of Fred and George like mischief in his blue eyes. “Is it wrong to wonder how many Slytherins we can freak out right now, Gin? I’m still holding a grudge from the 1991 Hogwarts Quidditch Cup, you see. We were absolutely flattened, and let me tell you that there was blatant cheating going on in the deciding match of the series. The team captain was renowned for playing dirty-”
 
  “Wasn’t that just the general Slytherin playing tactic? Their seeker was just the same when I used to play against him,” Harry said, flashing Draco a teasing grin.
 
  Draco’s face slipped into the old, familiar smirk he had worn during his and Harry’s long years of schoolyard rivalry. “Good grief, are you flirting with me, Potter?” he deadpanned, making Harry goggle and Theo burst out laughing.
 
  “Shhhh, they’re coming!” Ginny whispered urgently, leaping to her feet. Charlie scrambled up beside her, hauling Theo up by the hand while Ginny frantically urged a concerned looking Blaise to his feet. Charlie reached into the bag and passed a large hunk of meat to Ginny, one to Ron, and another to Theo. 
 
  “Anyone else?” Charlie asked, scoffing as Draco, Pansy, and Blaise backed away to take cover underneath an overhanging tree. Harry and Millie accepted a piece of meat then Hermione stepped doubtfully forward as well. 
 
  “What do we need to do?” she asked, eyeing the chunk of woolly sheep's leg that Charlie offered her with distaste. 
 
  “Throw it up to the dragons as they fly over,” Ron said with a grin. “Or, if you’re really feeling brave you can fly up to meet them and they’ll take it from your hand, but I’ve never done that before.”
 
  “No fucking way!” Draco said, sounding panicked as Hermione nodded dubiously. 
 
  “Are you all clinically insane?” Blaise asked, staring at Ginny in horror. “And stop drooling while you stare at Harry, Pans. It’s most disconcerting.”
 
  Ginny just laughed, threw Pansy a wink, then pressed a finger to her lips. “They’re coming, listen!” she whispered. Hermione jumped as Charlie cupped his hands around his mouth and let out a strange, shrieking cry. She looked rather wildly around the still darkening sky but couldn’t see or hear what had got Ginny so excited. Suddenly she became aware of an increasingly loud flapping sound, as if huge wings were beating in the sky high above her. “Holy shit!” Draco exclaimed, ducking further under the tree as Charlie repeated his eerie call. 
 
  “If you don’t want them to take the meat directly from your hand, throw it up as high as you can when they pass overhead. If you want them to take it from you, then fly up with me now.”
 
  Hermione stared wildly at Ron, wondering what to do while she watched him offer Millie his broom. Ginny, Theo, and Harry mounted their own brooms then took off, following Charlie up into the sky. Hermione gazed around, the noise from the dragon's wings was growing impossibly loud, but due to the now intense darkness, the dragons themselves were still nowhere to be seen.
 
  “Look!” Millie squealed, still hesitating on the ground, and Hermione gasped. The suddenly visible dragons were enormous. They were flying in an ever descending circle, in single file as if they were playing follow the leader. The first one approached Charlie who was hovering quite still in the sky. As the dragon neared him he held a piece of meat aloft. 
 
  Hermione held her breath, terror coursing through her as the dragon lowered it’s head, fixing Charlie with it’s large beady eyes. It’s giant wings beat the air, creating a powerful downdraft that caused Hermione to stagger. The dragon flew directly at Charlie, and someone, Pansy by the sound of it, squealed loudly, apparently as convinced as Hermione was that the dragon was going to knock Charlie straight off his broom. 
 
  At the last possible moment, the dragon swooped upwards, gaining enough height to seize the meat with its talons and clear Charlie’s head before flying away and disappearing into an unfeasibly small hole in the cliffs below.
 
  Charlie swooped across to Ginny, steadied her arm and waited beside her for the next dragon. “Oh, my gods!” Ginny said when she landed shakily back on the ground beside Hermione, “that was something else! Oh, she was so beautiful! ‘Mione, get up there. You’ll regret it if you don’t!”
 
  “Coming?” Theo’s face was alight with joy as he landed beside her, wiped a smear of blood from his hands then patted his broom handle invitingly. Before she could second guess herself, she stepped on board, then found herself in the air, staring utterly terrified into the eyes of the next oncoming dragon. Theo held her hand out firmly as the dragon closed in on them. 
 
  “No!” Hermione gave a panicked gasp, but it was too late to back out now. All of a sudden the dragon was on top of them, the meat was snatched out of her hand and she found herself staring at a large expanse of smooth underbelly scales. 
 
   “You’d better get used to this!” Theo said as they landed then turned to watch Millie finally step over Ron’s broom handle. Ron kicked off just in time to meet the last two dragons, and Millie whooped with delight as a sapphire blue one took the meat she offered, “because Charlie’s just offered me a job and I’ve accepted it!”
 
  “What?!” Hermione gasped, her jaw dropping at the sight of Theo’s ear to ear grin. “Wow! that's amazing news!”
 
  “I know! Come on, stop hiding under that tree, Blondie, get out here! You’re missing the show!”
 
  “I’m quite happy watching from here, thank you very much,” Draco said firmly.
 
  When the last dragon had disappeared into the cave system and the sky was pitch dark, Draco, Blaise, and Pansy finally emerged from the cover of the tree. “Dinner?” Charlie asked with a twinkle in his eye.
 
  “Mad. Utterly bonkers, that’s what you lot are,” Draco grumbled as he flew back along the coastline beside Theo and Hermione. “Nutters, all of you. I can’t believe you’d both risk your necks like that. I mean, what would have happened if-”
 
  “Do you want to tell him or shall I?” Theo’s breath tickled Hermione’s ear as he cut Draco off with a broad grin. 
 
  “Tell me what, Theodore?!”
 
  Hermione smiled, grabbing the broom handle nervously as Theo gave an excited jiggle. “Oh let me tell him! Draco, I’ve accepted the job Charlie just offered me-”
 
  “What?! Here! You mean Charlie’s offered you a job working here?! With the dragons?!” Draco turned wide, startled grey eyes onto Theo, his jaw dropping in alarm.
 
  “Yep!” Theo’s grin was infectious. Hermione found herself smiling alongside him, both of them laughing at Draco’s stunned expression.
 
  “Give me a moment,” Draco said faintly, then he plunged down into a loop-the-loop and dropped away, out of sight.
 
  “Where’s he gone?!” Hermione asked, squinting into the impenetrable blackness.
 
  “Probably to commiserate with Blaise. That's what he usually does when he’s despairing of me,” Theo grinned. "He'll come back in a minute." 
 
  Hermione nodded, torn between feeling excited for Theo and concerned for the practicalities of him accepting what was obviously his dream job midway through their last year of school. “When does Charlie want you to start? What about Hogwarts? What about finishing your exams?!” she asked as more and more questions flooded her mind.
 
  “What about it?” Theo shrugged, and Hermione winced, already sensing that she was fighting a losing argument.
 
  “Well, don’t you think you should take your NEWTS before you start accepting jobs? I mean-”
 
  Theo laughed, squeezing her tightly in his arms. “I knew you’d think of that. Let's not worry about the practicalities right now. There’s plenty of time to work all the details out, although I’ll start whenever Charlie wants me to start. I’m not going to let a chance like this pass me by, Hermione. Never mind about finishing school. This is where I want to be!”

  
  
 
  
  

  Draco reappeared as Hermione and Theo landed in Charlie’s garden. “Blaise says I’m to get over my fear of something terrible happening to you, then tell you how proud I am of you and that I’ll support you in everything you do. Which, of course, I will. But dragons, Theo? Really? Couldn’t it be bowtruckles? Or unicorns even? You know, something a little 
  
    safer 
  
  than dragons
  
    ?
  
  ”
 
  “Nope. It's really going to be dragons!” Theo grinned as he bopped Draco playfully on the nose. “Theodore Nott, Dragonologist. It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?” 
 
  Draco gave a non committal hum as he fixed his windswept hair. “A person who can put the word “ologist” after their name sounds academic to me. I imagine an ologist to be someone who does a lot of paperwork and has a nice sensible office job. Maybe the most adventurous thing they ever do is sit up too late at night writing research papers…” Draco suggested, trailing off in dismay as Theo mimed dying of boredom.
 
  Of course the other, much more interesting type of “ologist” works out in the field. They're rough and rugged from all the time they spend outside in all weathers, caring for their subjects-” Pansy grinned, throwing her arms around Theo, “well done darling, Ginny just told me.”
 
  “Why, oh why couldn’t you be the boring type?” Draco asked, his face breaking into a smile as Theo spun Pansy around playfully. “Seriously, love, I’m getting my head around it now that I’ve had a few moments to process it. It’s an incredible offer. I’m very proud of you.”
 
  “So am I!” Hermione said, following up the kiss Draco gave Theo with one of her own. “I think it’s wonderful news.” She swallowed down her own apprehension at the job's very clear dangers, choosing instead to watch Pansy and Charlie begin to warm a huge vat of stew on the stove. Charlie had survived relatively unscathed for a number of years as a Dragonologist, and she firmly told herself that Theo could do the same.
 
  Dinner was a lively and rather celebratory affair. Fred and George apparated in, fresh from their shift at the joke shop in Diagon Alley, gave everybody an early Christmas present, then subjected Blaise, Theo, and Draco to a somewhat alarming interrogation of their intentions for Ginny and Hermione. 
 
  “I hope you two are going to scrutinize Harry and Ron’s intentions for Pansy and Millie just as much as you're doing here?” Ginny pouted, pointing her empty glass at George for emphasis.
 
  “Ah yes,” Fred said, pausing in his robust questioning of Blaise to refill her glass with a steady stream of water from his wand, “unexpected relationships all around. That Cupid game really does pull some interesting pairings together, doesn’t it?”
 
  Hermione blinked as Ginny’s eyes grew round. “Oh my goodness! How do you know about the game? Wait a moment! Did you two play-?”
 
  “No, we didn’t,” George chuckled. “We had more pressing concerns in our final year. We devoted our time to creating mayhem and to getting rid of Umbridge, if you remember. The task quickly became a full time job.”
 
  “I played,” Charlie said, making Ginny swivel her astounded gaze across the table, “so did Bill. Percy didn’t, in fact I don’t even think he knew the game existed, which was probably a good thing. We didn’t know Sirius and Remus were the ones behind making it though, I’ll have to shake their hands next time I see them!”
 
  “Ah, yes,” Theo grinned as he picked up George’s words. “I forgot, you two didn’t finish your final year at Hogwarts either, did you?” 
 
  “Nope,” Fred shook his head. “And if you ask me, leaving school early was the best thing we ever did. Ouch! What was that for, Hermione?”
 
  Hermione wrung her hands guiltily as Fred reached down to rub the ankle she had just kicked. “Sorry but, Charlie’s just offered Theo a job here, and well, he doesn’t want to finish school before he takes up the position,” she said, giving Fred a sheepish smile. “I know leaving early worked out well for you two, but I’m not sure it’s the right thing for everybody to do.”
 
  Both of the twins raised their eyebrows into identical looks of surprise, offered Theo their congratulations then dived into a lively debate over the pros and cons of leaving school without taking any final exams. It didn’t take long before the conversation swung back to its original purpose, however, and soon Blaise found himself back on the receiving end of some rather blunt questions about his mother’s world famous habit of killing off her partners when she grew tired of them. 
 
  “Help!” Theo mouthed as George directed the next line of probing questions towards him, but Blaise just shook his head, clearly relieved to be out of the spotlight himself. “Listen, I’m going to confess right now, I’ve never had a single honorable intention in my life,” Theo announced, standing up rather abruptly, “I'm certifiably the boy that good girls are told to stay away from. Draco’s the responsible one here. Talk to him, I’m going outside for some, uh… fresh air. Coming, Blaise? Bye!”
 
  “Nicely sidestepped,” Fred said, giving both Theo and Blaise a strangely approving smile. “We’ll corner him later though, ‘Mione, don’t you worry. Now, Malfoy, moving on to you, how’s life treating you these days?”
 
  Draco widened his eyes at Harry in alarm, but Harry just grinned unhelpfully back from across the table. “Very well, thank you,” Draco said, gritting his teeth and glaring forcefully at Harry. “Oh, look, Theo left his hat on the table. Let me just see if he needs it. It's cold out there. Nice to see you Fr.. Geor.. Fr.. Weasley.” Draco picked up Harry’s beanie and fled out the back door with it clasped tightly in his hand. 
 
  “Slippery,” Fred said, his blue eyes twinkling in the firelight.
 
  “Sneaky,” George added, glancing over at Ginny who raised her eyebrows defiantly. 
 
  “Serpent like, in fact.”
 
  “Well, they would be less inclined to behave that way if you two weren’t doing the overprotective big brother act!” Ginny snapped. “What’s in the bag?” 
 
  “Shop samples,” Fred said.
 
  “Ooooh!” Ginny’s voice changed instantly. “Have you got any Wonder Witch products in there?”
 
  “Maybe,” George said, now smiling indulgently as he passed Ginny the bag. 
 
  “Hey ‘Mione, Pan’s, Mill's, come have a look in here!” Ginny called, and Hermione turned her attention to the bag of treats the twins had brought with them.

  
  
 
  
  

  “So this is where you snuck off to, is it?” Draco asked, smiling as they finally found Theo an hour later, leaning on the fence and watching the hippogriffs sleep.
 
  He smiled, turning to face them in the freezing cold night. “Sorry I didn’t come back in with you and Blaise earlier. I just needed some time on my own.”
 
  “You okay?” Draco asked, peering at him in concern in the moonlight.
 
  Theo smiled. He took a drag from his cigarette then exhaled slowly, watching the smoke drift lazily away in the frosty air. “I am. I’m very okay actually. I still can’t quite believe that Charlie’s offered me a job. Me, of all people! I really thought you and I would struggle to find jobs, Draco, me especially, since I don't have your brains. I really didn’t think anyone would ever look past my family's affiliations, but Charlie doesn’t seem to care about my past in the slightest-”
 
  “Of course he doesn’t!” Hermione exclaimed, taking Theo’s hand in hers. “Charlie doesn’t get hung up on stuff like that. He sees people for who they are, and clearly he sees that you have whatever it is he’s looking for. You know, he’s never once offered anyone else a job, in all the time he’s been working here. Sirius helps out a couple of days a week, and Remus too occasionally, when he’s not writing that is, but Charlie’s never officially employed anyone before now.” 
 
  “Really?” Theo asked, looking at her skeptically.
 
  “Really.” Hermione shivered and waved her arm to cast a wandless warming charm over them all.
 
  “I still can’t quite believe it.” Theo shuffled closer to Draco and laid his head on his shoulder, still looking slightly bemused when Draco slipped an arm around him.
 
  “Well, it’s time you started to believe it. Charlie offered you the job because you deserve it,” Draco said. “And, as terrifying as it’s going to be for me to wave you off in the mornings, knowing that you're going to be working with dragons all day, I was joking earlier. I know you’ll never be one to sit behind a desk and do paperwork. This job is perfect for you. I could not be any more proud of you than I am right now.”
 
  Theo grinned, turning his head to accept Draco’s kiss. “Does that mean you’ll come up to see the nests with me first thing tomorrow morning? Apparently, it’s routine to check the dragons are all healthy when they leave their roosts.”
 
  “Hell no!” Draco spread his fingers, backing away in horror. “No way. I’m still very proud of you but this is the kind of pride that works best from a distance. A nice, safe, dragon free distance.”
 
  Theo laughed. “Thanks, Draco.” He stepped forwards again and leaned on the fence, took a long pull on his cigarette, then stared at Draco thoughtfully. “You know, when you get your Outstanding potions NEWT, and you get accepted to do your mastery, I’m gonna be just as proud of you. You do know that, don’t you? You too, Hermione, when you get the best NEWT grades the school has ever seen? I know I’ve mucked around a lot at school, but you two never have. You know all your hard work is going to pay off, right?”
 
  “I hope so,” Draco nodded although he didn’t look totally convinced. “Although I doubt the Potion’s world is going to be quite as accommodating to ex Death Eaters as the dragon taming world seems to be-”
 
  Theo scoffed. “Malfoy, don’t be thick. You need to take some of your own advice sometimes. How many times have you told me to believe in myself? Of the pair of us, you're going to be the one who sets the world on fire. You’ve got the looks, the brains, everything. If the potions world can’t see that then tell them to go fuck themselves and set up independently. You’ve got all of Snape’s books, all of his secret recipes, and you know he never developed half of those to their full potential before he left them to you. You could fly high on that alone if you wanted to. Plus you’ve got the bottomless Malfoy bank vaults behind you should you need them. Lucius would back you. You know he would. So would I, for that matter, and my vaults aren’t to be sniffed at either.”
 
  “Set the world on fire.” Draco chuckled. “You're the one with the pet dragon. Alright fine. I hear you. Stand tall. Ignore all the shit and tell the conventional world to fuck off.”
 
  “That sounds about right. I’ve been saying that for years and just look where I’ve ended up! I’m right where I want to be, and somehow I’ve got you two beside me as well. Look at it, isn’t it stunning? I feel incredibly blessed!”
 
  Theo swept an arm out across the frozen fields for emphasis. The moonlight shone brightly, glinting on the frost and making it sparkle prettily. There were snow covered mountains in the distance, their white tips contrasting sharply with the monochrome color scheme all around them. “It’s beautiful here,” Hermione agreed. “Really, really beautiful. And actually, I do understand what you see in the dragons. They are just,” she sighed, “they’re just majestic.”
 
  “I feel silly sometimes you know,” she added, peering into the distance where she could just make out the inky blackness of the sea. “You two both know what you want to do, Harry and Ron are already signed up to the Auror training programme, Pansy wants to be a cook, Millie a healer, Ginny’s got the Quidditch world at her feet, Blaise is obviously going to make a fortune out of his magical tattoos, it seems that everyone knows what they want to do except me! I haven't even got a clue!” 
 
  “You could do anything you wanted to do.” Draco turned to her, gently sweeping a tumbling mass of curls out of her face. 
 
  “You could be Minister for Magic if you wanted to be,” Theo grinned, turning to face her.
 
  “Yep, I can see that!” Draco agreed. “Actually, no, I can’t see that at all, you 
  
    hate 
  
  the Ministry. You hate politics. You hate everything about it, so no. I don’t think that’s right for you. What do you 
  
    want 
  
  to do, Hermione?”
 
  She turned around, giving a huge sigh as she stared up at the moon. “I don’t know,” she said eventually, although that wasn’t strictly true. She did have an idea, a vague but impossible dream that she had harboured since her third year at Hogwarts.
 
  Theo never missed anything, though. He watched her appraisingly as she shifted uncomfortably. “Yeah you do,” he argued. He blew smoke up into the sky then vanished the end of his cigarette with a click of his fingers. “You do know, I can hear it in your thoughts but you're repressing it for some reason.”
 
  Hermione frowned in confusion, then followed Theo’s pointed gaze up to the silvery moon. “I don't know what you mean!” she exclaimed loudly, startling a wild owl that swooped low across the field on a hunting mission.
 
  “Oh, come on, Hermione. What about when you were thirteen years old and touting those ridiculous S.P.E.W. badges around? What about how worried you are about Remus tonight? What about the time you punched Draco on behalf of this Hippogriff here, the one that’s watching you right now, Draco,” Theo broke off, laughing at Draco’s startled gulp. “Actually, love, he really has got his eye on you!”
 
  Draco backed away from the fence looking concerned. “Shall we, uh, maybe continue this talk elsewhere? It’s a lovely night for a walk.”
 
  Hermione laughed. Buckbeak had his head under his wing, but he was indeed watching Draco closely through one beady eye. “I understand what you're saying, Theo,” she said, “but fighting for werewolf rights isn’t going to pay my bills, is it?”
 
  Draco flicked his silvery fringe out of his eyes and stared at her incredulously. “That’s your reason for holding back on what you truly want to do?”
 
  “Well, I need to be practical about things-”
 
  “Practical?” Theo laughed. “Sweetheart, do you know how much money Draco and I have between us?! I’m not meaning to brag here, of course,” he added as Draco pulled a pained face, “but the fact is, neither of us are hard up. I’m not suggesting that you become a lady of leisure and just sit back on our money, that would suit you about as much as Malfoy here would suit working with dragons. All I mean is that money needn’t be your primary concern right now. What would you like to do if money really was no object?”
 
  Hermione sighed. She tipped her head back and let the moonlight energize her. She had an idea, but it seemed crazy. Compared to the things the others planned to do, it was vague, uncertain and distinctly un-Hermione Granger-ish.
 
  “I want to study werewolves,” she admitted after a long pause. “I want to understand them, and then I want to educate people about them. Muggles think werewolves don’t exist, and the magical world is terrified of them because most of their knowledge comes from myth, legend, and a few hysterical tales of Fenrir Greyback’s savegary. It seems crazy to me, as a muggleborn, that werewolves have the reputation they do. I mean okay, Greyback was awful, but to counter that you’ve got people like Remus and Bill, who are perfectly nice, normal people, and yet thanks to the reputation werewolves have, Remus can clear a room just by lifting his lip at the wrong time of the moon cycle.”
 
  “Also,” she continued, really getting into her stride and missing the satisfied look that Draco and Theo shared, “how does the infection itself work? There you are, a nice normal, thoroughly 
  
    human 
  
  being
  
    ,
  
   then a werewolf bites you, and suddenly you change your physiology into a totally different species! Well what changes about you?! And how does it change? I want to put a werewolf through an MRI scanner and compare its physiology to that of a human. I’m sure if people understood what was actually happening, and we found a way to control the less, umm, desirable side effects of the condition, then I don’t see why werewolves couldn’t come off of the dangerous magical beings list and be classified as what they really are, which is a human being with a medical condition. What?!” she broke off, suddenly feeling embarrassed at how passionate she had become. 
 
  Theo smiled. “Nothing. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again, that’s all.” He picked up her hand and brought it to his lips for a kiss. “Do it.”
 
  “But….” She blinked in confusion, “I can’t just leave school and research werewolves! Who would sponsor me? Who would I be linked to?!”
 
  “I’d sponsor you in a heartbeat,'' Draco offered without hesitation.
 
  “So would I,” Theo agreed. “I’d sponsor 
  
    you
  
   too, Draco. And neither of you needs to be linked to anyone else unless you want to be. You're the Golden Girl, Hermione. Find some of that famous Gryffindor courage and follow your dream.”
 
  Hermione tipped her face up, bathing her face in the moon’s soft glowing light. She thought of Remus and considered Theo’s words carefully. Could she do it? With her friends' support and her own determination, she knew that she probably could. “Alright then!” she said, staring first Theo then Draco defiantly in the eye. “Alright. If you really mean that, then that's what I’m going to do. I’m going to start by basing my extra credit NEWT project on Werewolves. Let's see where it leads me, shall we?”
 
  “Good idea,” Draco said. “And alright. If you two are going for it, then so am I. I’m still doing my project on countering the unforgivables, but I’m also going to go through Snape’s secret books and see where they lead 
  
    me.”
  
 
  “Good.” Theo turned away from the fence and threw one arm over Hermione’s shoulder and one over Draco’s as he guided them back towards Charlie’s log cabin. “Now. I think we’d better get back. There’s a pair of twins inside who are just waiting to disapprove of me, and I’d hate to deprive them of the opportunity. I can’t have them thinking they’ve scared me off now, can I?!” 

  
    Chapter Text
    
  “I think studying werewolves is a brilliant idea,” Sirius said. “I’m a hundred percent behind you with it, Kitten. I have complete faith in your ability to do an outstanding job.”
 
  “As do...I!” Theo said, wincing as Blaise adjusted his tattoo gun then inked another line into the outline of the raven he was drawing on Theo’s lower back.
 
  “Sorry,” Blaise said, watching Theo squeeze Draco’s hand tightly. “Do you need a break?”
 
  “No. If you stop, I’ll never let you start again, carry on.” Theo took a deep breath, shivered, then visibly relaxed and signaled for Blaise to continue.
 
  “Haven’t you got used to that by now?” Sirius asked, casting an eye over the other inkings on Theo’s shoulders and chest.
 
  “Have you?” Theo shot back, and Sirius paused, then conceded the point with a shrug. 
 
  Draco adjusted the book he was reading, turned a page with his spare hand, and frowned at the picture in front of him. “Leaving werewolves aside for a moment, an unforgivable curse is cast with the intention of causing harm, right?” He asked, glancing up to acknowledge Sirius’ nod, “so, assuming that no spell is truly unblockable, do you think a strongly cast dark shield could block an unforgivable curse?”
 
  “What’s a dark shield?” Harry asked, looking up from the sofa he was sprawled on with Pansy.
 
  “An offensive shield cast with the intention of rebounding any curses aimed at it onto a specific target,” Sirius answered grimly.
 
  “Yeah,” Draco agreed. “They’re different from regular defensive shields. It’s a different incantation. My, uh…. my father used them a lot, but he never said if they worked on unforgivables.”
 
  “My father liked using them too,” Theo agreed. “I never got the hang of casting them myself, which I suppose is a good thing.
 
  “Love blocks unforgivable curses the best,” Harry said. “Or I suppose more specifically, it negates them. As does dying for the people you want to protect, although I'll admit that's a little drastic for blocking an Imperio, say.”
 
  Hermione jolted fully awake from her doze to watch Draco peer at Harry in a confused sort of way. “But love is the opposite of hate, and these spells are cast with hate,” Draco began.
 
  “They can also be cast with love,” Theo countered, staring hard at the fingernails on his spare hand. “If you love someone enough that you’d kill to protect them, love becomes your casting intention. Did you not know that? If you cast 
  
    that particular 
  
  Avada using hate, Draco, it would never have worked because you didn’t hate the person you were being told to kill. Had you cast it using your desire to protect Narcissa, it would have worked perfectly.”
 
  “But the one you cast would have worked,” Draco said, turning slowly to face Theo with a look of horrified comprehension dawning on his face, “because you cast it with the love you had for me. Is that what you're saying?”
 
  Hermione gasped, suddenly realising which particular killing curses Draco and Theo were referring to. Theo nodded while giving Draco an apologetic look. 
 
  “Fuck! I never knew that!” Draco said, rubbing his spare hand over his face.
 
  “You can cast any spell with a dark or a light intention. Thereby any spell can become light or dark,” Blaise said.
 
  “I always thought unforgivable curses were cast with hate. I’m with Draco on this. Love and hate are total opposites.” Pansy swung her legs around, sitting up on the sofa with a frown. 
 
  Dumbledore always used to tell me my biggest weapon against Voldemort was the love I held inside of me,” Harry took off his glasses, rubbed them on his jeans, then replaced them with a sigh. “I used to think he was bonkers, but it held true in the end. I let Voldemort kill me thereby giving my life in exchange for him sparing all of yours. None of his unforgivable curses had any effect on any of you afterwards because you were protected by my sacrifice.”
 
  A moment of complete silence greeted Harry’s words. Even the monotone buzzing of Blaise’s tattoo needle paused as every eye in the room swivelled to Harry. “Look,” Harry continued, suddenly sounding uncomfortable, “my mother died to protect me, and it worked. Her loving sacrifice gave me lingering protection and for a long time Voldemort couldn’t touch me until he physically strengthened himself by imbibing my blood. I died to protect all of you, which was another sacrifice made out of love, and that worked too. I’m not saying that sacrifice is the only way to negate an unforgivable. I just think you’ll block them more successfully with love than with hate.” 
 
  Draco nodded slowly. “Thanks for that, by the way. The dying for us thing. I don’t think I’ve ever properly thanked you for it before now.”
 
  Harry smiled. “No problem. I saw you, by the way, Draco, in the Astronomy tower. I saw you lower your wand. I know you couldn’t kill Dumbledore.”
 
  “No, because apparently my knowledge of magical theory was way off the mark back then.” Draco rolled his eyes. “But even if it wasn’t, I don’t think I could have successfully murdered Dumbledore.”
 
  “I know you couldn’t,” Harry said simply.
 
  Hermione held her breath as Harry and Draco stared at each other, both sharing a long, significant moment. She caught Theo’s eye, saw him lick his lips and swallow, then stare determinedly at the ceiling, obviously trying to hold back a tear as Remus wandered into the lounge. 
 
  Hermione gasped at the sight of the newly healed cut on Remus’ face and the fresh bandage on his left arm. She jumped up then paused awkwardly, afraid of throwing her arms around him for fear of hurting him further. “Are you withholding hugs now, Hermione?” he asked in a strained voice.
 
  “No, I just didn’t want to hurt you!” she exclaimed, stepping into his open embrace and gently closing her arms around him. “Oh, Remus! You look terrible!”
 
  “Good to know,” he held her tightly, then released her with a soft smile. Sirius patted the cushions into place on the sofa, and Remus sank into it while re-tying his dressing gown securely around himself. Sirius pointed his wand at the fire, and the flames doubled in height, filling the room with comforting warmth. He passed Remus a cup of tea and a blanket, smiling tightly as Remus nodded his thanks. 
 
  “How. How was it?” Hermione asked hesitantly. The room was eerily silent again. Theo nudged Blaise, who visibly jumped, then returned his attention to Theo’s half finished tattoo.
 
  “Not too bad,” Remus sipped his tea with a nod. “Everything aches now, but I guess that's to be expected following a violent transformation that breaks every bone in your body.” Hermione glanced at Pansy, watching her close her mouth then force her startled gaze back to Harry. Remus blinked his still amber eyes, and Hermione tried not to stare at his highly exaggerated canine teeth. 
 
  “How would you counter an unforgivable curse, Re?” Sirius asked, moving to sit on the sofa beside him. “Assuming you could, of course. Draco’s researching it for his project, and we’re debating blocking it with love, or deflecting it with a dark shield. It’s all gotten rather confusing.”
 
  Remus thought for a moment, watching the flames flicker in the fireplace. “Magical theory can be 
  
    very
  
   confusing, but I’d say love would have the best effect. But, it would have to be a very specific kind of love. A pure, unselfish, sacrificial love. A mother’s love for example,” he said, glancing anxiously at Harry. Hermione looked up as Draco wriggled his fingers free from Theo’s grip and started to flick through the book he was holding more earnestly. 
 
  “Hey,” Theo complained, pulling an exaggerated pout, “don’t worry about me, will you? I’ll just struggle on over here, resisting the pain. All by myself.”
 
  “Oh, come on, Nott, you’re a big boy now. I need my hand for a sec-”
 
  “I’m not that big! Hermione, you won’t abandon me in my hour of need, will you, love?”
 
  Laughing quietly at Theo’s consternation, Hermione moved to take Draco’s place. Her smile widened when she saw the almost finished tattoo outline that Blaise was still working on. It was perfect. Blaise truly was a skilled artist. “Hold still,” he said, touching the needle back to Theo’s skin, “Especially if you want this to move. It needs to be perfect, or it’ll drop feathers every time it flies and you’ll be cursing me forever more.”
 
  “As if I’d do that, Zabini. More so than I already do, that is. Ouch! There’s no need for that, now is there?!”
 
  “Don’t be cheeky when I have a needle in my hand then,” Blaise shot back. “Behave yourself, for once in your life. I’m nearly done with the outline. I’ll fill it in on our next session. Can I put the movement spell on now so we can see how it flies? Any adjustments will be easier to make before it's filled in.”
 
  “Yep. Go on,” Theo said, gritting his teeth. “Do your worst.” 
 
  Blaise grinned. “Don’t break Hermione’s fingers. I know you're not the best with pain.” Blaise set his needle down, picked up his wand and pointed it at the new tattoo. “Atramentum motus corvus volare.”
 
  Hermione squealed as Theo gripped her hand so tightly it hurt. He screwed his eyes shut, shuddering as Blaise finally dropped his wand. “I swear you enjoy doing that,” he muttered, exhaling heavily. “Sorry, love.” he said, massaging life back into Hermione’s numb fingers.
 
  “No problem,” she said tightly, wriggling her digits until they felt normal again. “Can we see it move?”
 
  Blaise nodded, smirking as Theo dropped his head into his hands, clearly struggling to recover from the painful spell. “We can’t touch it normally until it’s healed, but if you stroke its head, in a few days time, it should do….. this!” Blaise hovered his wand tip over the raven’s head, then smiled as it spread its wings and took flight. It flew across Theo’s back, around his side, across his stomach then settled back into its regular position, perching elegantly back on its outlined branch. 
 
  “That’s your best one yet,” Draco said, giving Blaise an appreciative nod. 
 
  “Thanks,” Blaise said, spraying the tattoo with a stasis potion then conjuring a clear bandage to cover it with.
 
  “That one’s brilliant,” Sirius agreed, looking highly impressed. “Stick me next on your waiting list, can you please?”
 
  Blaise nodded, looking delighted. He prodded Theo’s arm with his finger, making him jump. “Of course. Come on, put some clothes on. Malfoy’s much too distracted by your nakedness to get any proper studying done.”
 
  Theo lifted a brow at Draco who blushed then hurriedly dropped his eyes back down to the book he was supposed to be reading. Hermione smiled as she swept her eyes over Theo’s naked chest, blushing deeply as Sirius noticed her staring. 
 
  
  

  “Sickle for your thoughts, Hermione?” Remus asked when it was just him, Sirius and Harry left at Grimmauld. Ron and Ginny had left for dinner at the Burrow with Millie and a somewhat terrified looking Blaise in tow, Pansy was taking a nap, Draco had mysteriously disappeared to Malfoy Manor, and Theo had apparated back to Charlie’s to work out the finer details of his job offer.  
 
  Hermione blushed, dragging her mind away from what she had actually been thinking about and casting wildly around for a more shareable topic. Predictably Sirius wasn’t to be fooled, though. “Everything going alright, is it, Kitten?” he asked, standing up to put the kettle on. 
 
  “Yep,” she smiled. “It really is.”
 
  “I never thought I’d say this,” Harry said, “especially given our current partner situation, but it’s perfect, isn’t it?”
 
  “Yep.” Hermione took her hair clip out and shook her curls loose, blinking curiously as Remus visibly recoiled. 
 
  “Sorry. Terribly rude of me.” He pinched his nose with his fingers and smiled sheepishly. “My sense of smell is still incredibly sensitive. Your shampoo has quite a strong coconut scent.”
 
  “Oh!” Hermione clapped a hand over her own mouth. “I'm so sorry! I didn’t think.”
 
  “That’s okay, there’s no reason you would," Remus soothed, watching her closely. "Sirius tells me you want to study werewolves for your extra credit project.” 
 
  Hermione’s eyes widened in alarm as she regathered her hair. She hadn’t been planning to broach this subject with Remus yet, he was notoriously private about that side of his nature, especially directly after a transformation, and the last thing she wanted to do was upset him. “Stop worrying,” Remus said, breaking through her rapid train of thought. “I don’t mind. In fact, as it’s you who's considering doing it, I think a lot of good could come from this. I’m willing to share everything.”
 
  “You… you are?!” she asked, unable to keep the surprise from her voice.
 
  “I am,” Remus clarified. “I trust you, Hermione. I’ll share whatever you want to know. Sirius and Theo talk, as you probably know, and I’m aware of what you want to do. Theo said he and Draco are going to sponsor you, so I know money is not a concern, but even if it was, Sirius and I agreed that we’d sponsor you to do this ourselves. Answer me one question, though. Are you certain this is what you want to do when you leave Hogwarts? This isn’t just a whim, or a passing thought?”
 
  It seemed like such a weighted question that Hermione frowned, her mind spinning as she tried to understand exactly what Remus was getting at. “Yes! I’m certain I want to do my project on werewolves-”
 
  “That's not what he’s asking, Kitten.” Sirius said. “Come one, Re. Fess up. Tell them
  
     everything.
  
  ”
 
  Remus smiled, stretching back in his chair with an alarming amount of cracking joints. “Alright.” He chuckled. “So, you know I’m rather mysterious with my whole “
  
    writing thing,”
  
   he spread his fingers to accentuate the words, and Hermione turned to him, completely caught off guard. “Well, there’s a reason for that. I’m actually a fully published author. In the muggle world,” he added quickly as Harry snapped his head round to stare at him in surprise. “Nobody in the magical world knows me for writing, but in the muggle world, I have a string of published books. You might have heard of them, The Wolf King series?”
 
  Hermione paused, staring at Remus in surprise. She'd heard of those books. Not only had she heard of them, she'd bought a couple but hadn't got around to reading them yet. “But! You….. Surely not! Wait a minute…… Remus! Those books are on the New York Times Bestseller list…. Do you mean to tell me?” Hermione stopped and stared at Harry who looked thoroughly confused, and then at Sirius, who was openly laughing, "that you," she broke off, completely lost for words. "Wow!"
 
  “Yep,” Sirius said. “They’ve done very nicely indeed. My particular favourite review on them came from the New York Times, whose literary editor said, and I quote, “these books are so realistic, it's as if the author has inside experience of the world about which he writes.” I liked that one a lot.”
 
  “You're a published author?” Harry asked, apparently finding the fact just as difficult to grasp as Hermione was.
 
  “I am.” Remus smiled modestly. “I’m published in the muggle world, but I also have an interest in publishing my books in the Wizarding world. I feel different about my Lycanthropy now than I have for most of my life. With Sirius, and Bill and Fleur Weasley beside me, I was already growing in confidence, but with you and your friends beside me as well, I feel it’s time to strike out. Since the war ended, myself and Bill have been building up a network of people who have been bitten or attacked by werewolves. Most of them are Greyback’s victims. Some of them are fully turned, some are only vaguely affected, like Bill, but all have had their lives changed by an unprovoked attack. If you are serious about this, Hermione, I'm sure that most of our contacts would be willing to work with you, too. We need you to do this for us, to further our cause, as much as you need us to further your studies. We’ll work something out officially, if you like, but for now, I have an offer for you.” 
 
  Remus paused to accept the tea and biscuits Sirius put on the table, then fixed Hermione with his half amber, half hazel eyes. “Sirius and I are offering you a reciprocal arrangement. You can study myself and any other agreeable werewolves as much as you like. You can track us, scan us, do whatever medical tests you wish, and in return we'd like you to help us convince the magical world that werewolves on wolfsbane are very different creatures from those who don’t have access to the potion. We want to secure all werewolves a regular, affordable supply of medication, a safe place to transform and to spend the moon, then aftercare, healing, and the appropriate time off work to rest until they are recovered. We feel that if all werewolves are given those things as a matter of course, then werewolves need be feared no more. Now, what do you say, Hermione? You seem to have turned rather pale.”
 
  Hermione made an effort to close her mouth. Her mind had grown hazy, her head was swimming and her eyes were clouding with tears for what felt like the hundredth time in twenty four hours. “Umm,” she cleared her throat, her mouth struggling to form words. “Remus, I…. are you 
  
    sure 
  
  about this?”
 
  Remus nodded, looking determined. “Totally. As you know, I first met you, as your teacher when you were in your third year at Hogwarts. You amazed me even back then. I’ve never known anyone like you, Hermione, except possibly for Lily, Harry’s mum. You were brilliant then and you're even more brilliant now. So yes, because it’s you, I’m very sure. But I don’t offer this lightly, and you know that. So, I’ll ask you one more time. Would you like to work with me?”
 
  “Yes.” Hermione was up out of her chair and flying at Remus before she could stop herself. She tried to be mindful of his injuries but he didn’t seem to care. With surprising strength, he stood up and held her tightly while she shook with tears that she didn’t truly understand. “Yes,” she said again. “I’d love to work with you.”
 
  “Once you’ve finished your NEWTS, though,” Remus warned, and Hermione jumped as Sirius and Harry both burst out laughing. 
 
  “You say that like she’ll need convincing to take her NEWTS,” Sirius said, adding his arms to their hug. Hermione laughed as she tipped her head to the side and blinked Sirius’ unruly hair out of her eyes. “This one’s not going to give up school so lightly, is she?”
 
  “And just so we’re clear, Kitten, money is not a concern. If for any reason it falls apart with Draco and Theo, not that it will, I’m just saying, Merlin, don’t bite my head off," Sirius held up a placating hand as Hermione turned to glare at him, "I’m just saying, we’ll support you to do this. I’ve got more money than I know what to do with, and Remus has made a tidy sum out of the Wolf King books too.”
 
  “If it came down to money, I’d support you too, ‘Mione,” Harry said, sounding rather emotional himself. “The Potter vaults are also pretty full. You’re not going to be hard up, you know.”
 
  Hermione laughed as Remus finally set her down. “I’m starting to get the picture.” She grinned, unable to keep herself from doing a little jig of excitement. “Thanks Harry. I appreciate this, from all of you, more than you’ll ever know."  

  
  

  
  

  “Mind my raven,” Theo gasped as he and Hermione half staggered, half fell into their bedroom later that evening. 
 
  “Now that’s not something you hear every day, is it?” She laughed, pulling back from his heated kiss to admire the handsome bird once again. 
 
  “What can I say? I like to be different.” Theo pulled his T-shirt over his head, stepped out of his jeans, kicked them out of the way, then set about undoing Hermione's. She lifted her legs one at a time, trying to help him while she pulled her own top off, feeling almost frantic with desire
 
  She squealed as he picked her up, kissed her soundly then carried her over to the bed. “Silencio!” she called, briefly hoping her wandless charm would hold, before abandoning herself completely to Theo’s heated touch. “Merlin, I want you!”
 
  “I want you too,” he gasped, pinching her nipple sharply. “I’ve wanted you all day, and you didn’t help that by eye-fucking me all through dinner. It could be dangerous though. Since Draco seems to have abandoned us in favour of Narcissa, we’re all alone. We have no one to keep us on the straight and narrow.” 
 
  “I’ve discovered it’s more fun to stray off of that, actually,” she grinned, using her hands to urge Theo higher up the bed. As soon as he obliged, she licked a long stripe up his thigh, smiling at his sharp intake of breath. 
 
  “Indeed it is,” he agreed, taking her hands in his and pinning her to the bed. “Fuck that feels good! You're very forward tonight.”
 
  Hermione gasped, a powerful pulse of arousal causing her thighs to clench. A slow smile spread over her face as she recognised the meaning behind his words. “I’m sorry, 
  
    Sir,”
  
   she said pointedly, licking her lips, then purposely sinking her teeth into her bottom one and watching his cerulean blue eyes darken in response. She batted her eyelashes, mentally giggling at the effect the word had on him. “I got ahead of myself. I just want you so much.”
 
  Theo grinned. “How much?” He asked, brushing his lips over hers and groaning loudly as she kissed him straight back. His fingers strayed into her knickers and tugged the scrap of lace to one side. “Oops,” he said, as the flimsy gusset broke, allowing him to plunge his fingers deep inside of her. “Sorry. Oh!” he pulled back, raising his eyebrows as she gave a loud, protracted moan. “You want me this much. I see.” 
 
  Hermione nodded, opening her thighs wantonly. Theo removed his fingers, slowly licking them clean before leaning down to kiss her. “You taste divine,” he whispered, making Hermione whimper at the taste of her own, intense arousal. 
 
  Theo lined himself up at her entrance, stroking the head of his cock through her slick folds and spreading her remaining juices liberally over them both. “So wet, so….. oh fucking hell!” His words disappeared into a moan as she pressed boldly forward, “so bloody good, Hermione!” 
 
  She closed her eyes as Theo settled all the way inside her. He rocked into her further, pressing his hips flush against hers and reaching places inside her that she hadn’t even known existed before now. He lifted her calves, hooked them over his thighs, then pulled out and slid slowly all the way back in. “Oh Gods! She cried, lifting her hips and feeling thoroughly overcome by his long, sweet, easy strokes.  
 
  Theo watched her as he pulled back, holding her captivated in his intense gaze. “I love you,” he whispered, lowering himself down to rest his forehead against hers. “Your support today and yesterday meant the world to me. You, in general. You and Draco, I mean. You're both everything to me.”
 
  Hermione nodded, touched by his uncharacteristic softness. “I love you too. And thank you for talking to Sirius about my werewolf idea,” she whispered. “That meant a lot to me too.”
 
  “Good.” Theo held her eyes as he continued to move slowly, catching every sweet spot inside of her along the way. “Just so you know, I’ve never made love like this. Not to a woman, anyway. I’ve only ever been this soft with Draco.”
 
  “I know,” she said, a tear of overwhelm slipping out of the corner of her eye. “He told me.”
 
  “He’s such an arse sometimes,” Theo grumbled and Hermione’s laugh turned into a loud gasp as he bottomed out inside of her. She hooked her ankles together behind his thighs and wriggled, trying to pull him even closer. 
 
  “Yes, he is. But we love him anyway.” 
 
  “Yep. Though I maintain that was my secret to tell,” Theo agreed. He extracted her lower lip from between her teeth and nipped it playfully himself. “I keep telling you not to bite this lip, or I’ll do it for you,”
 
  Hermione giggled, suddenly noticing that, with her legs in this position, she was in full control. An idea crossed her mind and she smiled, she’d done what she had in mind with Draco a couple of times, and he’d been quite happy with the shift in power dynamics, Theo was a very different proposition though. “Can I try being on top?” she asked, watching his reactions closely.
 
  Theo stared at her for a moment, swallowed, then nodded, flipping them around with alarming ease. Hermione adjusted herself so that they were both comfortable, then started to carefully rock her hips. Theo gasped and as she watched he closed his eyes, leaving himself completely open to whatever she chose to do. Touched by his trust, she leaned down, taking the opportunity to kiss him again and again, the way he so often did to her.
 
  She took his hands in hers, bringing them up to the pillow. He opened one eye to stare at her in amusement. “I can’t cope with sticking charms,” he whispered. “You're at my limit now.”
 
  “I know that,” she agreed, lowering herself back down to kiss him all over again. She was touched that he had allowed himself to be this vulnerable with her, but she had no desire to go any further either. This wasn’t the power dynamic that either of them preferred. She released his hands, smiling as he lifted them up to cup her face. 
 
  “Are you done being in control now?” he asked, giving her a cheeky wink. 
 
  “I think so,” she laughed as he turned them back over, trapping her squarely underneath him on the bed. “I just wanted to see what being on top felt like.”
 
  “And?” Theo closed his eyes, picking up his pace until he was pounding mercilessly into her.
 
  “It was good. But I…...oh Gods! I prefer it….. this way. And…. I know yoooou… do tooooo!”
 
  “Good! Oh, sweet fucking Salazar! I’m gonna…. come for me…. Hermione.” He pinched her nipple, rolling it firmly between his finger and thumb and the sharp sting shot like electricity down to her clit. He sucked hard on the sensitive skin of her neck and she jumped, lifting her legs and grabbing his backside with both of her hands. 
 
  “Fucking hell!” Theo gasped, clearly trying to hold back his own orgasm. He released her nipple and the sting that followed as the blood flowed back into the abused bud caused her orgasm to detonate. “Mnph!” Theo exclaimed again as her walls clenched around him, pulling him in further with every desperate flutter they gave.
 
  Hermione was smiling when Theo finally lifted his head. He looked dazed as he panted to catch his breath. “Well that was different,” he said with a grin.
 
  “Yes,” she agreed, tugging her tangled curls out of her eyes. “It was. Good different or bad different, though?”
 
  Theo smiled at her indulgently. “Excellent different. I might let you try that again sometime.”
 
  Hermione smiled. “Good to know.” She stretched out in the bed beside him, snuggling into his side and wondering what time Draco would be home.
 
  Theo obviously heard her thoughts. “He’ll be fine,” he said, and it amazed Hermione  how little this bothered her now. At first she had found his untamed legilimency strange and rather disconcerting, but now it just felt comforting. “He’s with Narcissa. It’s about time those two spent some time together.” 
 
  Hermione closed her eyes, trying to keep her further worries to herself. “If you really want to learn Occlumency to keep me out, then ask Draco to teach you. But honestly, I wouldn’t worry too much about it. I’m shit at Occlumency too, and I really don’t mean any harm by doing this. It's not something I have any control over, although Charlie seems to think I could develop it to help communicate with the creatures I’m going to care for,” Theo admitted, nuzzling his face into her hair. “I tune out most of what I overhear accidentally from other people, but if it bothers you I won’t comment on anything I hear from you in future.”
 
  Hermione huffed out a laugh. “There’s no point trying to deny what's bothering me with you, is there? In fact, I don’t even know why I’m trying anymore. It’s not like we have anything to hide from each other, is it?”
 
  “I’ve got nothing to hide from you or Draco either,” Theo agreed, “but I'd be pissed off if I couldn't keep 
  
    anything 
  
  private. We are allowed to have private thoughts, after all. Feel free to tell me to butt out anytime you like. I will just say this though. Narcissa’s a lot nicer than you think. She’s put up with my cheek for years, and she never truly believed in all the blood supremacy shit, she just got caught up in it because Lucius believed it, and she loved him. Then, during the war, she did what she needed to do to keep Draco and Lucius safe. She’s going to think you’re wonderful. She always wanted a daughter, but she and Lucius couldn't conceive any more children after they had Draco. So she’ll be more than happy to dote on you.”
 
  Hermione’s mind boggled at the idea of Narcissa Malfoy doting on anybody, but, she supposed, stranger things had happened in the past. She had been expecting Lucius to be very different to how she had actually found him, and if she could cope with meeting him and Thoronus Nott in Azkaban, she was sure she could cope with meeting Narcissa Malfoy.
 
  “That's the spirit,” Theo said, trailing his fingers over her bottom and spreading her cheeks with a wink. “Now. Where were we?”

   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    
  Hermione woke up to a shaking bed and a soft but familiar moan. Her lips curved into an incredulous smile as she cast a Tempus charm onto the floor next to the bed and the glowing amber numbers told her it was a little after two in the morning. 
 
  She hadn’t heard Draco come home, but that wasn’t exactly surprising. She knew from the very rare occasions that he stayed up later than her and Theo that he was adept at slipping under the covers without disturbing anybody. More than once, she had fallen asleep alone, or beside Theo, then had woken up hours later to find Draco holding her gently. Draco was, in that respect, the polar opposite of Theo, who came to bed late almost every evening, and despite his repeated assurances that he would be quiet, succeeded in waking both her and Draco up every time. 
 
  Smiling fondly at their differences, Hermione turned over, keeping her movements as discreet as possible. The last thing she wanted to do was disturb either of her boyfriends midway through acting out one of her deepest fantasies. 
 
  The street lamps in the square outside gave her just about enough light to see, and as her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she pressed a hand over her mouth, biting down on her knuckles in an effort to stifle a wanton moan.
 
  Theo was wrapped around Draco, taking him from behind with long, slow, leisurely strokes. Draco’s eyes were closed, and he was gripping the bed sheets millimetres away from Hermione as though he was reaching for her but stopping short for fear of waking her up. From what she could make out in the gloomy twilight, both of them looked as if they were about to come. 
 
  Hermione forced herself to stay quiet, even as her breathing stuttered and a mewl of desire threatened to fall from her lips. She had always been captivated by watching two men kiss, and the sight of Draco and Theo locked together like this was possibly the most arousing thing she had ever seen. They looked stunning together, as opposite in appearance as they were in personality. They were the perfect mix of dark and light. Theo’s dark, curly hair and olive skin contrasting starkly with Draco’s silken white blonde tresses and soft, alabaster complexion. 
 
  Hermione couldn’t drag her eyes away from the erotic scene in front of her. She thought she saw Theo’s lips twitch, his mouth mirroring the flicker of recognition in his eyelids, but Draco, completely lost in the throes of rapture, remained unaware of her attention. Unable to help herself, Hermione slipped her fingers beneath her pyjama shorts, then bit her lip as she stroked her aching sex. 
 
  Despite her efforts to remain quiet, she gasped as she remembered the previous evening’s events. She hadn’t bothered to shower last night, had merely settled down to sleep in Theo’s arms after their passionate tryst, and she was still slippery with his earlier release. 
 
  She jumped, feeling a hand touch her wrist. Draco paused while Theo tugged gently at her waistband. “Come here, you. I know you’re awake, and honestly, how many times do we need to ask you to sleep naked?” Theo asked, sounding thoroughly amused. “I've heard your reasoning, but you're a witch, Hermione. Your need to be rescued in the night by the Brigade of Fire is virtually non-existent.”
 
  “I know, but my mother once told me I should sleep with knickers on just in case I ever needed to climb down a ladder!” she exclaimed, toeing the offending shorts out of the way as Draco burst into incredulous laughter. "My mother was a muggle, remember? She didn't know about apparation."
 
  “Isn’t it the Fire Brigade, anyway?” Draco asked, “not the Brigade of Fire?”
 
  “I don’t give a flying fuck what it is. Just take your clothes off and get over here,” Theo grumbled, slowing his pace with Draco, who groaned in protest. “I don't know if you can see, sweetheart, but my cock is currently buried deep inside Draco’s arse. You feel sublime by the way, my love,” Theo punctuated his words with a sudden snap of his hips that made the bed jolt, and both Draco and Hermione gasp loudly. “In a moment, Draco’s going to slide his own achingly hard cock deep inside you, so that I can fuck you both at the same time. Assuming that’s alright with you?”
 
  Hermione gave a shaky exhale. Theo’s filthy words caused a fresh flood of arousal to wash through her body, and she drew her legs up while whimpering softly in response. “That’s more than alright with me,” she replied, inching closer to Draco and rubbing herself against him in invitation. “Hi,” she whispered.
 
  “Hi,” Draco gasped, reaching forward to kiss her squarely on the mouth. He groaned loudly as Theo bumped him forwards once again. “Shit, Theo, if you keep doing that, I’m not gonna be able to last!”
 
  “Yeah, you will,” Theo said confidently. “I know your signs. I know when I can push you and when I need to hold back. Stroke her clit, Draco, slide your fingers deep inside her and see if you can work out what we did last night.”
 
  Draco’s fingers moved obediently downwards. Hermione sighed as his hand splayed out over her belly then slid down between her legs. “Sweet Merlin,” he breathed, pausing to kiss her desperately again, “had fun, did you?”
 
  “Yep,” Theo gave Draco several more hard thrusts, then reached around to firmly pump his cock with his hand. 
 
  Hermione whimpered, watching Draco’s eyes roll up into his head “Hermione, Gods love…. you feel so good like that. I love knowing you two were together while I was out. Come here sweetheart. Oh! Theo, stop or I’m gonna come!”
 
  “No, you're not,” Theo kissed Draco's neck as he slowed his movements back to a more leisurely pace. “Not yet, anyway. You won’t come because I’ve told you not to. You’ll wait for permission, or you’ll be in a whole world of trouble.” Draco buried his head in Hermione’s shoulder, panting as he fought for control. “Hold on, Draco, unless you want that pretty Slytherin arse of yours spanked until it’s bright Gryffindor red-”
 
  Draco lifted his head, cursing fluently while he caught his breath. “How many times do I have to tell you, saying things like that…. doesn’t help in the slightest!”
 
  “Sorry.” Theo said blithely, continuing to wait until Draco had composed himself. 
 
  “How can I both love it and hate it so much when you do that?” Draco said, shaking his head and wiping a hand over his flushed face.
 
  Theo smirked as he softly stroked Draco’s hair. “Because you love to be edged,” he whispered, pressing a reverent kiss to the back of his head. “You’ve told me you love it. Which is why I sometimes do it. But if you’ve changed your mind I won’t do it again. That’s the closest I’ve ever pushed you, though. Are you okay, or was that too much?”
 
  Draco sighed, sagging against Hermione as his body finally calmed. “No. I’m fine. It was perfectly timed. I do love it because you always make it earth shattering in the end. That was 
  
    right
  
   to the limit though. You know that?” Draco turned his attention back to Hermione, smiling as she wriggled gently against him, urging him to enter her. “Sorry," he closed his eyes and gave her a wry smile. "I’ve lost track. Do you need some foreplay, sweetheart?” he asked, “or are you ready for me?”
 
  “I’m more than ready for you,” she insisted. Truthfully she was close to coming herself. Watching Theo push Draco so close to his limits had been heady. She lined herself up then moved forwards so that Draco could press inside her slick walls. She closed her eyes, her toes curling with the intense pleasure his intrusion brought. Her whole body still felt sensitized from what she and Theo had done a couple of hours previously. Draco settled himself inside of her and she wriggled impatiently against the sublime feeling of fullness, gripping the bedsheets with her fingers as he started to move. 
 
  “You two must have had quite an evening,” Draco said, twisting his hips in small circles and causing tiny silver lights to burst behind Hermione’s eyelids. 
 
  “We did,” she gasped as she felt Theo retake control. Draco submitted instantly and the perfection of their sexual compatability hit Hermione full force as Draco laced his fingers through hers. “We missed you, though. Oh…. Mhmmm!” The thought that Draco was moving inside of her while Theo was inside of 
  
    him 
  
  was driving her wild. She wanted to be in the middle of them both herself, with the pair of them taking her at the same time. Theo reached forward to stroke her clit and she bucked hard against Draco, pressing against him while reaching out to touch Theo as well, trying to get as close to them both as she physically could. 
 
  It didn't take long for her to build to the same point of desperation that Draco was feeling. "Are you both alright?" Theo asked, smiliing at Draco's incoherent reply. "I'm not going to stop this time, Draco. I'm going to give you that earth shattering orgasm you deserve. You're always so good for me. So, so good. You two Hermione. You're both perfect. I'm going to make you both come so hard you scream-" Theo broke off as Hermione squealed, her body clenching involuntarily around Draco, her mind spinning with future possibilities. She snapped her own hips, bumping Draco backward into Theo and making him moan as Theo started to move just as he’d promised. 
 
  It was fast and relentless. Draco pressed forward into her, moving at the rhythm Theo set. She cried out loudly as Theo thrust deeply, then blinked at a loud, outraged shout that sounded from somewhere outside of their room. 
 
  She had no time to wonder what was happening. Draco stilled deep inside of her, biting down on her shoulder to muffle his cry of release, and Hermione’s orgasm crested just as a wash of vaguely familiar magic entered the room. 
 
  Whatever was going on didn’t seem to be bothering Theo, so trusting his judgement, she closed her eyes and let herself succumb to the tidal wave of intoxicating bliss. Draco held her tightly, murmuring affirmations as she mewled softly, and she felt the exact moment that Theo reached his own climax as he pushed Draco even deeper inside of her. This new and intense pressure caused the aftershocks of Hermione’s orgasm to continue fluttering long after they would normally have subsided.  
 
  When she finally calmed, and reality started to filter back in, she opened her eyes, blinking in the brilliant but inexplicable silver light that was now filling the room. Thoroughly confused, she glanced at Draco, but he offered no explanation. Still half buried inside her, he had merely turned his head to hide his face in the pillow. The only part of him visible underneath his hair was his ears, which were currently glowing bright red. Theo, however, wasn't looking so abashed. In direct contrast to Draco, he had pulled himself up into a sitting position and was now shaking with quiet but defiant laughter.
 
  As Hermione’s hormone addled brain caught up with her eyes, she gasped then clapped a hand over her mouth in surprise. Blaise’s panther Patronus sat beside the bed, blinking at them all accusingly. Hermione squealed, yanked her top down, and blushed just as deeply as Draco’s ears. The Patronus opened its mouth and spoke with Blaise’s deep, steady voice. "I carry a heartfelt message to the three of you. In the name of 
  
    sweetest 
  
  Salazar, will you please, 
  
    please, 
  
  remember to cast a silencing spell?!" 
 
  Hermione’s jaw dropped for a full five seconds before she dissolved into horrified giggles. Theo continued to roar with laughter while Draco explained to the pillow exactly which combination of spells he planned to use to murder Blaise.
 
  A split second after the panther dissolved into misty silver vapour, Ginny's silver mare pranced through the bathroom wall. "Don't worry about him, ‘Mione. He’s just grumpy because you woke us up. Just so you know, the noise you make is being magnified somehow through the bathroom that joins our rooms, and we can’t silence it from this siiiiiiiiiiiide……! Oh Merlin…. yes! Gods….Blaise!” The patronus faded as Ginny's voice petered out into an incoherent gasp. 
 
  Hermione blinked as a moment later Blaise’s panther returned. "Don't mind, Ginevra. She is currently indisposed."
 
  Theo finally managed to control his laughter. Still chuckling, he waved his wand, casting his own silver lioness into the room. "Excellent. Have fun, and don’t forget now, Silencio!” With a flick of his wand, Theo sent the Patronus off then flopped back into the pillows with a smile. 

  
  

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  

  Consequently, Hermione found herself blushing rather deeply when she stepped into the kitchen the next day. “Well, hello,” Blaise said, looking up with a broad grin as Ginny buried her head in her hands. “How are you all on this fine, uh,” he paused to look out of the magically charmed window, “grey, drizzly morning?”
 “Never been better, thanks,” Theo returned Blaise’s grin while reaching over his shoulder in an attempt to swipe a croissant from his plate. “We had an extremely good night.”   
  “Far too slow, Theodore,” Blaise smirked, slapping his hand away. Hermione winced as Ginny finally looked up to meet her eye. Ginny shrugged helplessly and Hermione gave a pained smile as she looked away.
 
  Theo rolled his eyes and reached for the coffee pot instead. “Oh, for fuck’s sake. I forgot to bring that sodding gameboard down again,” he cursed, pouring a cup of coffee, handing it to Hermione then starting to pour a second cup. “Every time I go to look at it, or try to do anything with the game something else crops up. Have you noticed?”
 
  “Yes, actually,” Blaise said, fixing Hermione with his twinkling brown eyes and making her blush yet again. “I was going to ask you what was going on. Do you just keep forgetting about the game because you’re inept, or is something else happening here? it does seem to be moving past the point of coincidence now.”
 
  “Inept?!” Theo flipped Blaise the finger, passed a cup to Draco, then turned to Remus, 
  
    “
  
  I mean, I suppose it could be me being forgetful, but this does seem a little strange.
  
     Is
  
   there likely to be something else going on here?”
 
  “There could be, I suppose.” Remus tore his gaze away from the manuscript he was no longer bothering to hide now that his true identity was out in the open. “If the game thinks you’re all getting on well without its interference, it could have decided to bow out. Our magic was always rather unpredictable, wasn’t it, Sirius?” 
 
  Sirius nodded. “When the four of us were together, it often took on a life of its own. Okay, let's think about this. We designed the game to bring people together, didn’t we?”
 
  “Yes, and the prompts were designed to give any couples that were struggling a bit of a helping hand. But I suppose, if the relationships were solid and the game saw itself as more of a hindrance than a help, it might have enough sentient magic inside it to bow out. You lot are all getting on pretty well if last night was anything to go by.”
 
  Sirius glanced up as Hermione buried her face in her hands yet again. “Alright there, Kitten?”
 
  “No! I’ve died of embarrassment,” she complained from beneath her fingers. A glance at Draco told her that he was blushing almost as deeply as she was, “and no disrespect, Sirius, but how do 
  
    you two
  
   know what happened last night?!”
 
  “We overheard Ginny telling Pansy what happened this morning,” Sirius admitted, his grey eyes sparkling softly. “No disrespect taken, Kitten.” 
 
  “I think that dying of embarrassment might be a slight overreaction, Hermione,” Remus said kindly. “Remember that time James’s parents caught us, Pads?”
 
  Sirius laughed. “How could I ever forget? Now that 
  
    was
  
   awkward. Poor old Fleamont, I think we traumatised the man. Your grandfather never looked at us quite the same way after that particular incident, Harry.”
 
  “Well, we were in the middle of his garage, in broad daylight too. We really should have been more discreet,” Remus said, giving Harry a contrite smile.
 
  “You really shouldn’t have looked as good as you did in motorbike leathers, then Moons,” Sirius smirked as Harry joined Hermione in hiding behind his hands. “Mind you, you still look pretty damn hot in them now.”
 
  Grinning, Theo held up his hand for a high five, which Sirius returned while Remus and Draco exchanged an exasperated look. “I'm sorry if we disturbed any of you last night,” Draco said.
 
  “You disturbed us!” Ginny huffed, throwing a croissant across the table to catch Theo’s attention. “Your bed was banging against the wall, and never mind forgotten silencing spells, it sounded like you’d deliberately magnified yourselves! Malfoy, that croissant was supposed to hit Theo on the nose! It's because of him that Blaise and I know far more about your sexual dynamics than we really should!”
 
  “If it was supposed to hit him on the nose, why was it sailing past his left ear, Gin?” Draco held the croissant he had caught in his hand, shrugged then bit into it. “Seeker’s reflexes. If we need to improve our silencing spells, you need to improve your aim.” 
 
  "I, umm, might need to make a confession here," Sirius said, looking unusually serious as he held up his hands to stop the bickering. "Hermione, you, Draco, and Theo are staying in what was my old room, and Ginny, you and Blaise are in what was my brother’s old room. Myself and Reg had a communication channel set up through the bathroom, that way we could check up on each other when my parents-” Sirius broke off and pulled a face, squeezing the reassuring hand that Remus put on his shoulder “-well, when things weren’t so good at home. You met my mother’s portrait, Hermione, sometimes it was better for us, well, for me in particular, not to leave my room. Apparently the channel still works. I forgot it even existed!”
 
  “Oh, good grief!!” Ginny gave a pained laugh, “
  
    that’s 
  
  why everything was so clear. We did wonder if you’d magnified yourselves on purpose…. that’s why we sent the first Patronus! Oh, Godric, Sirius, I mean, that’s awful, I’m so sorry you needed a secret channel for that reason, but it’s a brilliant invention, leaving aside what happened last night, of course!”
 
  “I don’t want to hear about 
  
    anything
  
   that happened last night!” Ron said, shaking his head, his red hair flying as if to punctuate his distress. “This sounds like far more information than I should be hearing about my sister and my best friend. I’m suddenly very glad our bedroom is several floors below yours.”
 
  “Well, that does explain some things,” Blaise said, nodding his understanding at Sirius. “Is my raven still intact?” he asked, nodding in approval as Theo lifted his top to show off the still perfect tattoo outline.
 
  “How was dinner at the Burrow?” Sirius asked, grinning apologetically at Hermione who finally dropped her hands away from her face and reached for a croissant of her own. “I really am sorry, Kitten, I’ll cancel the channel today. On a vaguely less touchy subject, Ginny, did you and Ron send my regards to Molly?”
 
  “We did,” Ron said, “Mum returned the greeting through rather tight lips and a deep scowl, then immediately asked after 
  
    dear 
  
  Remus.” Ron shrugged, helping himself to another croissant. “I don’t think her feelings towards you have mellowed much I’m afraid. In fact, they may have gotten worse recently. She’s rather put out that Gin and I are staying here instead of at the Burrow for the holidays.” 
 
  Sirius rolled his eyes. “And how is that my fault and not Remus’ too?” Sirius asked, shaking his head at Remus’ benevolent smile.
 
  “Molly and Sirius don’t exactly see eye to eye,” Remus explained to Blaise, Draco, and Theo who were all watching him curiously. 
 
  Sirius scowled. “No. She once accused me of using my incarceration in Azkaban to shirk my godfatherly duties. I’m still angry about it now. Especially since she thinks the sun shines out of Moony’s-”
 
  “Why don’t you bring that leaderboard down, Theo,” Remus said, cutting Sirius off with a smirk. “Let's leave the clearing up for later and go out onto the patio. Sirius has been busy decorating. I’m sure he’s keen to show off his handiwork.”
 
  Curiously, Hermione picked up her coffee mug then followed the others out of the cluttered kitchen, up the stairs and outside into the gloomy morning. She put one foot out onto the patio then bumped squarely into Pansy, who had stopped short while squealing loudly with delight. 
 
  The patio, which was always warm and cosy, thanks to the myriad of enchantments already on it, was now looking gloriously festive. The sides were charmed to show a vista of pristine, snow covered mountains rather than the reality of the muddy, winter bare garden. The sides of the gazebo were strung with several strands of delicate, star-shaped fairy lights, a multitude of enchanted snow globes and baubles hung from a large, snow covered christmas tree, the fire pit was crackling merrily, and soft christmas music was playing from the charmed stereo in the lounge. 
 
  “Wow!” Hermione breathed, looking around her appreciatively. “When did you do all of this?!”
 
  “This morning,” Sirius grinned. “While you were all sleeping off your eventful night, some of us were busy with our wands.”
 
  “From what I heard, that was the problem last night, too,” Pansy teased, glancing up at the lavish decorations with a smile, “people being busy with their wands! Oh, don’t mind me,” she giggled as Hermione spun around incredulously, “I’m just disappointed that Harry and I slept through all the fun. This is beautiful Sirius, I love this house, it’s so happy and festive!”
 
  “Which is a far cry from how it used to be. What’s more, the improvements are mostly down to you, Pads,” Remus said, pressing a kiss to Sirius’s lips. Hermione smiled, nodding as she sank down into a nearby chair. Forgotten communication channels aside, Grimmauld Place was a far cry from the dingy, dark house she had first encountered at fifteen years old. 
 
  “It’s blank!” Theo called, striding out onto the patio then abruptly stopping. “It’s totally blank! I’ve prodded it, cast Revelio and a myriad of other spells over it, but there's not even a glimmer of response. This looks brilliant, by the way!”
 
  Remus frowned, taking the rolled up scroll of parchment Theo passed him. “So it is.” He looked at the blank page fondly, ran his wand over it, tested it with several different spells, then passed it on to Sirius with a shrug.
 
  “How long has it been like this?” Sirius asked, also casting several of his own rather wild and showy spells over the inert piece of parchment. 
 
  “No idea! But for the last couple of weeks I’ve been saying we should hold game meetings and then forgetting all about them. I think you’re right. I think the game’s bowed out! Now how do we know who won? I mean, we were top of the leaderboard, but-”

   

  “You were top. Back then. That doesn't mean you still would be,” Blaise countered with a sly grin. 
 
  “Well, we were planning to leave anyway,” Millie said, glancing at Ron then continuing to investigate Sirius’ decorations. Ron took her hand as he nodded his agreement. “We talked about this a few days ago. We don’t want to play anymore either,” Millie continued. “It’s been brilliant, you were the most fantastic Cupid, Theo, but we’re happy together. We don’t want to compete anymore.”
 
  Ron nodded again, curling his fingers around Millie’s wrist and stroking his thumb over her pulse point. The tender gesture made Hermione smile. “I’m so glad,” she said softly. “I’m so glad you two found each other. I was skeptical about this game at first, as you know, Ron, but I’ve changed my mind now. A lot of good has come out of it.”
 
  Ron looked at her thoughtfully. “I agree. I’m glad you’re happy too, ‘Mione. I bet you’re glad I stopped you from storming out of the Halloween ball now, aren’t you?”
 
  Hermione frowned in confusion, then remembered her initial outrage at being paired up with Draco and Theo all those weeks ago. “Yes,” she smiled, reaching across to squeeze Ron’s spare hand. “I am. Thanks for that.”
 
  “No problem.” He returned her squeeze, then let her go with a smile. “Though I still don’t want to know what happened last night!”
 
  Hermione laughed as Sirius finished interrogating the leaderboard and threw it onto the table in front of them. “It’s done,” he proclaimed. “It’s decided its job is over, and it’s closed down for another year. It’ll reopen at Halloween next year for the next group of students to play, but we’ll not get anything more out of it this year.” 
 
  “So what are we supposed to do now?” Theo asked, looking at Blaise, who shrugged. Both of them turned back to Sirius, who raised his eyebrows questioningly. 
 
  “About what?” he asked, exchanging a glance with Remus.
 
  Theo looked at him as though it was obvious. “Well we don’t know who would have won!”
 
  Sirius sighed. “No. I guess we don’t. Dammit. The vaguely mature and sensible part of me feels compelled to tell you that it doesn’t matter, that the game was about building relationships and that it served its purpose in that way, but we all know I’m never going to say that. Not knowing the outcome would drive me round the twist too.” He spun around to level an accusing stare at Remus. “This has got to be your level-headed influence on the magic, Moony. James and myself would never have left it open ended like this! Any ideas as to what we should do now?”
 
  Remus sighed as he rubbed the bridge of his nose. “Well, the outcome is pretty obvious to me,'' he said. “Ron and Millie just bowed out, Harry and Pansy have never really been in, and since that only leaves two pairings, both of whom are getting on equally well, I think the game has decided to accept joint winners. Ginny and Blaise, and Hermione, Draco, and Theo all took first place.” 
 
  Draco cleared his throat and stared at Remus looking amused. “Joint winners? That’s never going to work, I’m afraid. Especially not with these two. Blaise and Theo are probably the most competitive people I’ve ever known, especially when it comes to each other. I’d say they’re rivalry is worse than mine and Harry’s, the main nastiness between us notwithstanding, of course, Potter, and that’s without taking into account last night’s rather traumatic events-”
 
  “Oh sweet Merlin,” Pansy agreed, running her fingers through her glossy hair. “I think you’re right. 
 
  “And you’re an innocent angel, are you Malfoy?” Blaise challenged, lifting one skeptical brow at Draco. “You’re not the tiniest bit competitive yourself?-”
 
  Before Draco could reply, Sirius, Theo, Pansy, and a rather incredulous looking Harry all snorted with laughter. Hermione closed her eyes, avoiding Draco’s look of outrage as she tried to get her own mirth under control. 
 
  “Quidditch,” Ginny said loudly, cutting through the clamouring chatter. 
 
  “Pardon?” Draco turned away from a still giggling Millie and stared at Ginny in confusion. 
 
  “I say we settle this entire thing with Quidditch. The game paired Slytherins up with Gryffindors, right? In an effort to break down the house rivalry boundaries and to make us realise how similar we all are. Correct me if I’m wrong at any time, Sirius, Remus?”
 
  “Nope, you're right so far,” Remus said.
 
  “Putting it like that makes our intentions sound almost honourable,” Sirius smirked. “I’m not sure they were all that pure. The game started because Pete wanted to kiss that pretty Slytherin girl, didn’t it?”
 
  Remus pulled a disgruntled face at the casual mention of their former friend. “And because you wanted to get off with Marlene-”
 
  “Nonsense,” Sirius asserted, stepping towards Remus and pushing his knees apart. “I’ve only ever had eyes for you, Moonpie.”
 
  Remus gave him a doubtful look. He put his hands on Sirius’ hips and pulled him closer. “Have you now? I think several of the girls in our year would disagree with you. Not to mention the ones in the year above. And a couple in the year below too. You had quite the reputation-”
 
  “Pulling this back to Quidditch,” Ginny said forcefully, “because, to be honest, we all seem to be just as competitive as each other here, I suggest we settle this whole thing with a match at Charlie’s. One huge, game deciding match. Let’s do it Saturday afternoon. Myself and Blaise will captain one team, and Theo, Draco, and Hermione can captain the other. What do you all say?”
 
  Hermione laughed as she turned to see Blaise and Theo sizing each other up. “I say that's a brilliant idea. Get yourself prepared to lose, Nott.”
 
  “You're on. Although I’ll only ever lose in your dreams, B,” Theo grinned, holding out his hand. 
 
  Blaise accepted Theo's handshake, and Hermione laughed as they both tried to crush each other's fingers. Giving up on her half formed admonishments, she looked helplessly at Pansy instead. 
 
  “Don’t give me those innocent brown eyes, Granger,” Pansy said, sliding into the seat next to Harry, “You're just as competitive as they are. I remember you trying to beat me to the snitch in our drunken Hogwarts match a while back. I say bring it on.”
 
  Hermione laughed. “Fine. As long as we can invite everyone else who took part in the Cupid game to take part in the match too. Not Daphne Greengrass though, if you don’t mind?”
 
  “That’s fine by me,” Draco said. 
 
  Hermione nodded. “Quidditch it is then. And just so you all know, I also play to win. I have no intention of losing this game now!”

  
  
  
  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    
  “That’s all the invites to the Quidditch match ready to send,” Hermione said, sealing the last envelope shut with Grimmauld Place’s wax stamp. “We just need to pop to the post office in Diagon to owl them out.”
 
  “Let’s do that tomorrow since it’s getting a bit late now,” Ginny replied, staring at the delicate floral tattoo that Blaise was inking onto her left arm. 
 
  Blaise frowned as Ginny shifted position yet again. “Keep still, 
  
    mia dolcezza. 
  
  I know this is uncomfortable, but you really don’t want a crooked design. Do you need a break?”
 
  “Sorry.” Ginny returned Blaise’s tender kiss then settled back in her chair with a sigh. Hermione dragged her eyes away as Blaise gently stroked Ginny’s long hair, the intensity of their interactions making her feel as if she was intruding on a private moment. She looked up, grateful for the distraction of the door opening. “Okay, carry on,” Ginny was saying, “I'm good for a while longer. Oh, umm…. hello Charlie!” 
 
  “Sweet Merlin, Mum’s going to kill you!” Hermione gasped as Charlie Weasley stepped onto the patio, grinning brightly and being closely followed by Theo, Sirius, Remus, and rather inexplicably, his brother Percy. “Though I suppose her seeing you with a tattoo might take some of the pressure off of me. Why she only moans about my long hair and body art and not Bill’s, I’ll never know!”
 
  “It’s because Bill’s married, and he and Fleur are giving her grandchildren, while the only kind of babies you're interested in are baby dragons! Anyway, I like to live dangerously.” Ginny poked her tongue out at Charlie then lifted her brows at Percy, trying to provoke him into voicing his obvious disapproval. “What are you both doing here anyway?”
 
  Charlie grinned while Percy shuffled his feet, still looking uncomfortable. “We’ve come to share some good news. Theo, Percy, and myself have just come from Minerva McGonagall’s office at Hogwarts.” Charlie hooked a chair out from under the table, glanced at the copious amounts of study notes spread out over every workable surface, then sat down in a relatively clear spot. “Theo and I were working out the logistics of his job offer when we hit a snag. We came up with a potential solution, went to put it to Minerva, and she not only liked it but escalated it rather hugely. To cut a long story short, Percy is now on loan to us from Kingsley, and you all have some decisions to make. I hope you’re all feeling open to some new ideas?”
 
  Hermione’s heart pounded anxiously as she watched Draco snap Snape's potion notebook shut then turn to stare at Theo. “Why do I have an ominous feeling about this, Theodore?” he asked.
 
  “I’ve got no idea.” Theo ruffled Draco’s hair affectionately. ”I don’t know why anything I’d do would cause you concern-”
 
  “Life experience,” Draco deadpanned. “I’ve learned that this particular twinkle in your eye means trouble.”
 
  “Doesn’t Theo mean trouble in general?” Blaise asked, grinning as Theo saluted him.
 
  Hermione closed her eyes and massaged her temples, mentally bracing herself for whatever they were about to tell her. Despite consciously trying to calm her nerves, she still felt uncomfortably on edge. Inexplicably, she could feel that something was about to change. 
 
  When nobody else spoke, she turned to gaze curiously at Percy. She’d never seen him at Grimmauld Place before, and she was struck by how out of place he looked. His immaculately tailored Ministry robes and prim disapproval were entirely at odds with the laid back, relaxed atmosphere that Hermione had grown so used to over the last few weeks, and she couldn’t help feeling a pang of sympathy for his palpable discomfort.
 
  “Alright, what’s happened? You’ve been to Hogwarts. What’s Minnie agreed to that’s caused Kingsley to drop everything and fling his undersecretary at you?” Sirius asked. 
 
  “Minnie?!” Theo echoed, cocking his head as Percy’s permafrown deepened. “I like it. It suits her. Makes her seem vaguely less terrifying, somehow.”
 
  “Ah, Minnie’s a pussycat when you get to know her,” Sirius grinned. “Literally. We spent enough time in detention with her to learn that, didn’t we, Re?”
 
  “As I recall, it was mostly you and James who ended up in detention with 
  
    Minerva
  
  ,” Remus smiled. “I was the prefect, remember?”
 
  “Oh, yes. How could I forget?” Sirius gave a wry grin, waved his wand, and Remus’ multicoloured wine glasses soared out of the house and onto the table. He followed the glasses with an unopened bottle of firewhisky, which Harry caught as it flew perilously across the patio. ''Never put a toe out of line, did you, Moony? This sounds like the kind of occasion that calls for a drink. Give us a moment. Then when we’re properly braced, you can tell us what's happened.”
 
  Charlie shook himself out of the daze he had fallen into while watching Blaise continue to tattoo Ginny. “Well, as I said, this all started because myself and Theo found ourselves with a dilemma. I need someone to help me full time on the reserve now,” Charlie continued, accepting a drink from Sirius and scooting it across the table to Percy, “have a drink Perce, you need to loosen up a bit.”
 
  Percy glanced incredulously at his watch, “it’s quarter past four in the afternoon, Charlie!” he spluttered. “We’re still within work hours!”
 
  Sirius shrugged, leaned forwards, and added another measure of firewhisky to Percy's glass. “Better make it a double then. Take a measure back for Kinglsey too. I always did like him.”
 
  Percy stammered something about Ministry protocol, but his objections were drowned out by Charlie and Ginny’s laughter. 
 
  “Anyway,” Charlie continued, accepting his own drink with a nod of thanks to Sirius. “I can’t wait until Theo’s finished school in July. I’m snowed under as it is, and nesting season will be upon us before we know it. Theo also wants to start work now, but he’s no fool. He’s been listening to Fred and George, who, as you know, are quick to extol the merits of leaving school early, but he's also paid attention to Draco and Hermione, who both have a very different viewpoint. He came to me with what I thought was an interesting compromise.”
 
  Charlie turned to flash Hermione a grin, and she nodded, touched that Theo thought her words worthy of consideration. “Theo offered to work a reduced number of hours for me each week, while also flooing in and out of Hogwarts to attend certain lessons. He wanted to ask Minerva if he could drop some NEWT subjects, the ones he feels are unnecessary to his chosen career path, and focus instead on the ones he really needs. I liked the idea. I thought it was the perfect compromise, so we floo called Hogwarts and Minevra told us to come on through. She was also intrigued. So, she, in turn, floo called the Minister, who sent Percy through, and with Percy’s help we’ve spent this afternoon designing a study-based apprenticeship scheme. Minerva thinks it's a brilliant idea.”    
 
  “
  
    Professor McGonagall
  
   believes that the current eighth year schooling arrangements aren’t working out terribly well. She’s had several rather unpleasant incidents to deal with since the start of term, and she admits that there are more mental health problems amongst the students than she had anticipated," Percy said. "Consequently, she was relieved to accept an alternative education plan. She intends to announce the proposal to the rest of the returning seventh and eighth year students, and to hold individual career planning meetings after Christmas. The Headmistress has very kindly agreed to consider each student's wishes, and to allow me to produce tailored education packages for those students that wish to take part in the new scheme. The program is entirely optional, any student who wishes to remain in full-time education may do so,” Percy finished with a pointed look at Hermione. 
 
  Hermione looked sharply up at Theo, who grinned straight back. "See? Nothing to worry about at all. Percy has everything in hand. It's clear that Minnie," he paused to grin, sounding out the name experimentally, "adores him." 
 
  Theo pulled a cigarette out of the pack Sirius offered him, and lit it with a bluebell flame that he then tossed to Draco over a scandalized looking Percy’s head. Before Draco could react, Sirius Accio’d the flame across the table, used it to light his own cigarette, then tossed it upwards. The flame spun, escalating into an enormous flash of fire that shattered and rained showy blue sparks down over the patio. “You need to teach me the incantation for that!" Theo gasped, looking highly impressed. 
 
  Percy stared wordlessly at Sirius and then at Theo, both of whom grinned brightly back. Giving up on any admonishments, Percy huffed out a sigh, looked imploringly at Remus, then shook his head as Remus turned away with a poorly hidden smile. Percy took a long, steadying breath in through his nose as Theo continued to speak. "Anyway, I’m going to study for NEWTS in Care of Magical Creatures, Potions, Herbology, and Charms, then I’m going to drop the rest of my current subjects in favour of working for Charlie. Minnie is happy to offer the same concessions to all students, so if you all want to do something similar, you can. You just need to work out a suitable plan with Percy here.”
 
  “But this is where I need to make a confession, Sirius, Remus,” Charlie said. “I don’t have any extra accommodation set up at the sanctuary yet. I’ve offered Theo an eventual live-in position, as long as we’re both happy working together long term, that is. It shouldn’t take long to set up extra housing, but Minerva seemed to think that students on a part time curriculum shouldn’t be living in the same Hogwarts dormitories as those who are still attending full time. So, I was wondering if Theo could bunk down here for the time being-”
 
  “Of course you can!” Sirius said, lifting his eyebrows and looking delighted. “There’s plenty of room for any of you who want to do that. Isn’t there, Re?”
 
  “Are you sure?” Theo asked, looking nervously from Sirius to Remus. “Both of you? Only it’s a big ask. I mean technically I wouldn’t be homeless if you said no, there’s always Nott Manor, but honestly-”
 
  “I think I'd choose to be homeless rather than stay there. Nott Manor is worse than a mausoleum,” Draco interjected. "You can't go back there. I won't let you-"
 
  “You're very welcome to stay here. I've never been more sure of anything in my life,” Sirius asserted. “Remus and I both agree that having you all flitting in and out of here over the last few weeks has turned the place around.”
 
  “That offer would stand for any of you that wanted to do the same thing,” Remus said, smiling as he looked around the table.
 
  Sirius nodded his agreement, and Theo smiled gratefully back. Hermione tuned out the excited chatter that broke out all around her and took a tentative sip of the firewhisky in her glass. She blinked her watering eyes as she regarded Theo's obvious happiness, then sighed heavily. 
 
  “You look like you need to talk to Blaise,” Draco whispered. 
 
  “Do I?” she asked, wiping her eyes with a confused frown. “What about?”
 
  Draco steepled his fingers together in front of his nose and regarded her thoughtfully through the gaps. “Well, I know it appears that all he and Theo do is bicker, but in reality, they’re extremely close. You might not know it, but Blaise is incredibly protective of Theo. Look at him now.”
 
  Curiously, Hermione turned to look at Blaise. Having long abandoned his attempts to keep Ginny still, he was also watching Theo. But, Hermione realised, whereas her own face clearly showed her concerns, Blaise was regarding Theo with a look of outright pride. Catching her eye, Blaise canted his head in question, then when Hermione held his gaze, he stood up and moved around the back of the table to crouch down behind her and Draco’s chairs. “What's wrong?” he asked. 
 
  “Nothing.” Draco smiled. “It’s perfect for him, isn’t it?” 
 
  “I think so.” Blaise agreed. “I think it’s a brilliant idea. And I think we’d all be mad not to at least consider doing something similar ourselves. But you don’t look so sure, Hermione. Why not?"
 
  Hermione sighed again as she contemplated her drink then pushed it to one side. In her opinion, Percy was right, mid afternoon was much too early to be drinking neat firewhisky. “Nothing,” she lied, shaking her head at Blaise’s disbelieving look. “Oh, who am I kidding?! School doesn’t suit everybody, right?” She continued slowly, meeting Blaise’s level gaze while trying to keep Fred and George’s arguments in the forefront of her mind. 
 
  Blaise shook his head. “No. It doesn’t. I thought Theo would drop his NEWTS entirely at the first chance he got,” Blaise said. “Take it as a huge compliment that he’s not, because that will be your and Draco’s influence. It’s just a little change, that’s all. It’s a safer world out there now.” Blaise dropped a hand onto Hermione's shoulder as he stood up. “Just remember, not all change has to be feared.” Blaise tightened his grip for a moment, then let go, walking casually away as if he hadn’t just sent her mind barrelling out of control with his carefully chosen words.



  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 



  “Psssst, ‘Mione. What’s up?” Ron asked half an hour later. “Why aren’t you joining in with the celebrations?” 
 
  “Nothing’s up. I’m fine,” she lied, wondering why she was trying so hard to convince everyone of this. Predictably, Ron saw straight through her weak assurances. He peered at her for a moment longer, threw Harry a significant look, then stood up and left the patio, tilting his head to indicate that Hermione should follow. Grateful for his discretion, she waited a couple of moments then excused herself to the toilet, not wanting to put a dampener on the burgeoning party mood.
 
  She climbed the first set of stairs and found both Harry and Ron waiting for her on the landing. Ron ushered her into his and Millie’s bedroom then closed the door with a snap. “Don’t you dare say this is nothing, ‘Mione, I’ve learned the hard way through various bird attacks not to ignore you when you’re upset.” 
 
  Totally taken aback, Hermione laughed. “That was one bird attack, Ronald, and you thoroughly deserved it!”
 
  “Undoubtedly I did.” Ron nodded seriously. “But the pecking still hurt, and I’ll not make the same mistake twice. Tell us what’s wrong?”
 
  She sighed, stalling for time by picking at a non-existent thread on the duvet cover. “Isn’t Pansy going to mind me being in here with you, Harry? I thought she was worried about us being alone together.”
 
  Harry shook his head. “Not anymore. She’s relaxed about all of that now a bit of time has passed. Apparently, most of the school had you and I pegged as an item, even though we’ve never even-”
 
  “But, you and I would never have worked as a couple!” Hermione snorted her disbelief. “We’d have killed each other if we’d tried to go out together. You and I would have been worse together than Ron and I were!”
 
  “Thanks!” Harry teased. “Good to know, ‘Mione. I think Pansy realises that now too,” he said more seriously, reaching up to adjust his glasses on his nose. “So, back to the problem in hand. What's wrong?”
 
  “I think Professor Mconagall is right,” Hermione said, shaking her head sadly. “Us all living together in one dorm isn’t really working out, is it? I got this today,” she haltingly reached into her pocket and pulled out a folded over piece of parchment. “It’s a letter from Daphne. Draco went to Malfoy Manor yesterday, then on to see Narcissa in France. Daphne and Astoria were still staying there. They gave him this to give to me, and a similar one to give to Theo. Theo read his, and brushed it off, saying we shouldn’t worry about them anymore, but I can’t do that just yet
  
    , 
  
  and I don’t know if that makes me a terrible person or not.” 
 
  She sighed, fingering the folded up parchment in her hands. “I’m just so 
  
    sick 
  
  of all this in-fighting! I honestly think that pushing us all back together at school after the war was a terrible idea. I want to embrace what Charlie and Theo are suggesting, but I just worry that giving Theo this much free rein is a bad idea. I mean what if he forgets all about his studying while he’s at Charlie’s? He might not pass a single exam, and what if something happens to him while he’s working with the dragons, and what if everyone else does the same thing and nobody passes anything?!” She broke off, suddenly noticing how high pitched and hysterical her voice sounded. She shook her head as she sank down onto the bed. “I’m being ridiculous again, aren’t I?”
 
  “Thoroughly,” Ron confirmed, smiling in a valiant attempt at stoicism. 
 
  “Only a little,” Harry said, much more gently. “And we understand why you're worried. But you do seem to be on the verge of a panic attack, and that’s not like you these days.”
 
  Ron moved to sit on the bed beside her “‘Mione, what’s really behind all of this? It’s not like you to be irrational. You know that some people aren’t particularly academic. You must know that I’m going to jump at this chance too. If I can, I’ll bring Auror training forward. They originally wanted the three of us straight after the war but McGonagall told them we had to complete an extra year of school first. So, if Percy can make me a plan and that offer still stands, I’ll drop a few subjects and take the Auror course alongside the NEWTS that will be useful to me.”
 
  Hermione sniffed, wiping her nose on the scruffy handkerchief that Harry passed her. “Thanks. Won’t you just drop the whole lot in the end, though? If the NEWT courses are optional?”
 
  Ron shook his head slowly. “No, actually, I don’t think I will. It’s strange, but the more someone tells me I have to study, the less I want to do so, particularly if I find the subject hard. If it’s my choice to take a subject NEWT, then I’ll study for it. I want to be an Auror, ‘Mione, and I can’t do that if I fail all of my exams. I’d bet that Theo feels a similar way. I reckon his motivation levels will surprise you.
 
  “I think Ron’s right,” Harry agreed thoughtfully. “If I can, I’m going to do the same thing. Look at what we've all been through. Are you really surprised that this enforced eighth year isn't working out?”
 
  “No.” She shook her head, thinking hard while trying to pinpoint her remaining worries. She stared around the room, gazing at the mix of Ron and Millie’s belongings. She recognised a lot of Ron’s things, both from his dorm at Hogwarts and from The Burrow, but his possessions were seamlessly blended in with a multitude of other, more feminine things that were obviously Millie’s. For some reason, the juxtaposition made her feel anxious all over again. 
 
  She swallowed, feeling her jaw drop as the root of the problem clubbed her over the head with the force of a mountain troll. “Oh my gods! I’m such an idiot!” she gasped, smacking herself hard on the forehead. “I never saw it! All this time, it’s been staring me in the face but I never understood!
  
     That’s
  
   what this is all about!”
 
  “Uh, that’s what…. what's all about?” Ron asked, blinking at her in confusion.
 
  “Could you enlighten us mere mortals who aren’t blessed with telepathic legilimency please?” Harry grinned as he flopped down on the bed beside them, propped his head on his hand, and picked up a well worn, grey, stuffed kneazle that clearly didn’t belong to Ron.
 
  “Sorry!” She said, hugging her knees into her chest. “It’s the change that's bothering me more than anything else!” She sighed, watching Harry smooth the kneazle’s matted fur. “I discovered I was a witch when I was eleven years old. Within a month, I’d moved into Hogwarts, met you two, and we’ve all more or less been friends and lived there ever since. The one time we didn’t live there was when we were on the run and look how that turned out! Harry, do you understand what I mean? You had a similar introduction to the Wizarding World,” she clarified as Harry cleared his throat, looking nonplussed. “I’m looking at this all wrong! I’m looking at Hogwarts like it’s our security blanket, and the magical world outside as terrifying, but actually, all the drama and grief we’ve been through this year has come from the people inside Hogwarts! Blaise was right. We can leave school safely this time!”
 
  Harry licked his lips. He took off his glasses, polished them on his shirt then replaced them on his nose. “I do know what you mean, actually, ‘Mione. To a certain extent, I understand. But the important point here is that we 
  
    can
  
   leave school safely this time. We 
  
    can
  
   start our new lives without being in danger. You can come in, Malfoy!”
 
  Harry opened the door with a wave of his hand, revealing Draco and Theo who had apparently been loitering in the hallway. “How in Salazar's name did you know we were out here?”
 
  Harry snorted ruefully. “Eleven years spent living in a cupboard makes you notice when someone hovers outside the door.”
 
  “Yes. I suppose it would.” Draco exchanged a bewildered glance with Theo, who shrugged. “Now, did you say that to stop us from noticing your current position? You both seem to be in bed with our witch?”
 
  Harry grinned, putting the kneazle down as a look of concern flashed across Ron’s face. “Yep.” 
 
  “Ah, come on, Draco, what are you worried about?!” Theo grinned. “She’s got us, a rugged, handsome dragon tamer, and a book-loving potions genius. Why would she be interested in cheating on us with the two saviours of the world?”
 
  Harry cocked his head at Theo, staring at him in amazement. “Do you ever, you know-”
 
  Draco grinned. “Don’t finish that question, Potter. Because, no. He really doesn’t.”
 
  “Which is one of the reasons I love him.' Hermione jumped up, wiped a tear from her eye then threw her arms around him. “Theo, I’m so sorry,” she said. “I should have been more positive about all of this. I should have been the first to congratulate you. I was looking at it all wrong, and I was scared because the last time we left Hogwarts was at the climax of a war that nearly killed us all. I lost sight of how much safer the world is now. Of course we can floo to school daily if we want to. Of course, you should drop the subjects you hate and focus on the ones you need. I’m over the moon for you. I really am.”
 
  “Wow!” Theo picked her up and spun her around, then deposited her down in front of Draco. “Maybe you should get in bed with these two more often if this is what happens!”
 
  Hermione laughed as Draco hugged her. “Sometimes I just forget that we’re a lot safer now than we used to be,” she admitted.
 
  “We are,” Draco said. “But with the experiences we’ve had, that’s an easy thing to forget. Sometimes I need reminding of it too.” He sat on the bed next to Harry, picked up Millie’s kneazle, stroked it’s worn fur and sighed. Twelve years in a cupboard or twelve months with V...Vol...de...mort living in your home. I’m not sure which I’d prefer. See, Hermione? logically, I know we’re safe now, but I still stumble over saying his name.”
 
  “Both of your prior living arrangements sound terrible, to be honest,” Ron agreed. “I think I was pretty lucky by all counts.”
 
  Draco nodded. “I used to bully you because I was jealous of what you had. You know that, right?” he asked, staring at the patterned duvet cover and missing the incredulous expression on Ron’s face. “I love my parents, but I’d have swapped my mother’s primness and my father’s coldness for what you had in a heartbeat. They got better, ironically, my parents did. The madder Vol...demort got, the softer they got, I think they realised their mistakes. But I’d have given anything to grow up in a family like yours. Money isn’t everything, is it?”
 
  “No?” Ron’s voice was so high pitched it sounded like a squeak. He cleared his throat and tried again. “No. It’s not.” 
 
  “I’m not the only one who had a tough time, though. Ichbod,” Draco indicated the well loved kneazle in his hands, “is the last thing that Millie’s mother gave her before she lost herself to potions and to faceless men who promised her the world. I’m sorry I was such a dick to you, Ron.” Draco held out his hand, and Ron moved forward to take it. “You’re treating Millie well, and you're a good friend to Hermione too. I can see that you're a good man.”
 
  “Thank you.” Ron looked amazed as he dropped Draco’s hand, his eyes darting between Hermione, Harry, Draco, and Theo.
 
  “Oh, why were we all so stubborn?!” Hermione exploded. She took the kneazle from Draco and hugged it tightly to her chest. “We could all have been friends years ago. Look what we’ve all been through! Oh! I really need to stop crying over everything too! This is perfect. You’re all properly friends now. Shall we just drag Millie and Pansy, and Blaise and Ginny in here too? I mean, do we really need to hold this quidditch match to decide the outcome of the game?”
 
  “Yes!!” Theo, Draco, Ron, and Harry all said together, staring at her as if she’d suddenly sprouted a second head. “I’m not losing this game to Zabini. I was Cupid, for Salazar’s sake! Wait a moment, Harry, Ron, why do you two care so much about the outcome?”
 
  Harry chuckled as he shook his head, his messy hair flying. “Because I’m playing seeker for Gin and Blaise. Blaise asked me this morning. I’m just as invested in this match as you are now.”
 
  “And I’m, uh…. I’m playing keeper for them too,” Ron admitted as Draco’s jaw dropped another notch. 
 
  “Zabini’s a sneaky git! I can’t believe they’re picking teams already! And you two agreed?! Well, this changes things. I hereby retract my apology, Weasley.”
 
  “Too late,” Ron grinned. “I’ve already accepted it. And the only thing that surprises me here is that you three haven’t picked your own team yet. Blaise beat you to it, that's all.”
 
  Theo huffed. “Blaise’s Slytherin is showing. Time to get ours out, Draco. Charlie’s ours, and Sirius will be in a sec, apparently, he still plays pretty well. You’ll be seeker, Blondie, I’ll be a beater. What position do you fancy playing, love?” 
 
  Hermione stared up at the ceiling to think. Her first instinct had been to turn down the offer of playing in favour of staying securely on the ground, but now she’d changed her mind. A new mantra was running through her brain, and she rather liked the sound of it. “It's okay to try new things. You're safe now.” “Chaser, I think,” she said with a smile as all four boys gaped at her in surprise. 
 
  Harry was the first to nod. “That makes sense. You’re better on a broom than you used to be, but I’m not sure I like the idea of you swinging a beater's bat with your minimal experience. So yes, I agree, Chaser is perfect.”
 
  “Right.” Theo nodded his agreement. “Let's sort the rest of the team out. I can’t believe Zabini did this, right under our noses too!”
 
   “Hang on,” Harry said, stretching his arms up above his head. “Wasn’t there something else? Are you going to show us that letter or just cuddle it all afternoon, Hermione?”
 
  “What?! Oh!” Hermione startled then passed him the now crumpled piece of parchment. 
 
  Harry adjusted his glasses once again then started to read out loud. “
  
    Dear Hermione,
  
 
  
    We are writing with great happiness, to inform you that Astoria’s blood curse has been broken. As of the latest test results there is no trace of the centuries-old magic anywhere in her body.
  
 
  
    We are truly delighted by this and would like to extend our deepest gratitude to you. We will be forever grateful for your help. 
  
 
  
    I, personally, would also like to extend an apology for my outburst in the common room when you confronted myself and Tracy over our attempts to secure Astoria an engagement. At the time, we truly believed this was the only way to save her life. Although Tracy does not condone this letter, I am writing it on all of our behalfs. As I’m sure you will understand, I was brought up with the traditional beliefs of a pureblood wizarding family, and although I’m told that we must all update our beliefs and move with the times, apparently, as many people would, I struggle to do this while under such extreme pressure.
  
 
  
    Therefore, I extend this heartfelt apology for my misstep. 
  
 
  
    Thank you again for your help. It is very much appreciated.
  
 
  
    Much love,
  
 
  
    Daphne, Astoria, and Tracy.”
  
 
  “Wow!!” Ron said as Harry folded the parchment over with a frown. “What a backhanded apology! I was also brought up in a pureblood wizarding family, and I can assure you that this is a complete load of bollocks. You believe what you want to believe, ‘Mione, it's as simple as that. Set fire to that travesty and poke Daphne in the eye next time you see her.”
 
  “Better still, hit her with a few choice curses,” Theo muttered. “Bitch. My letter had quite a different tone. It was all simpering and apologetic-”
 
  “She practically draped herself all over me in France,” Draco shook his head, “begged for my forgiveness while wearing the most revealing top I’ve ever seen.”
 
  “What did you tell her?” Hermione asked in a small voice.
 
  Draco smirked. “I told her to fuck off. To keep fucking off and that if she ever thought about stopping, then she was to keep going and fuck off even further. My mother was quite horrified.”
 
  Hermione stared at Ron then joined in with Theo and Harry’s laughter. “Well, that told her, I suppose!” Harry said, looking impressed.
 
  “You know Narcissa will blame me for that?” Theo grinned. “Your language is terrible, Theodore. You're such a lovely boy, from such a wonderful family. Why must your words be so uncouth? Well done, Draco. My family was also terrible for blood prejudice, but we learned from our mistakes and admitted when we were wrong. I much prefer the way I think now. Don’t look at me like that Ron. Honestly I’m as surprised as you are by this impromptu love-in. Here sweetheart, burn that letter. We don’t need Daph and her pathetic attempts at an apology. We’re better than that. New beginnings, remember?”
 
  Hermione watched as Theo conjured a bluebell flame. He spun it across the room in an arc then flicked his fingers, nodding in satisfaction as it exploded into a shower of sparks then reformed in Hermione’s outstretched hand. She laughed as she held the flame to the parchment, watching as it caught fire and tongues of brilliant blue flame consumed the offensive words. “New beginnings,” she whispered. “Let's see where they lead.”








  
    Chapter Text
    
  Saturday morning dawned bright and unusually sunny for mid-December. Hermione opened her eyes, smiling as Draco pulled her snugly against him. He summoned his wand with a wave of his hand, caught it, then pointed it at the curtains, which sprang open, allowing a blinding shaft of winter sunlight to fall over the bed.  
 
  Theo merely grunted and turned over, flinging his arm over his face in protest at the early wake-up call. Undeterred, Draco continued his efforts to rouse him by lighting a roaring fire in the hearth, then leaning over Hermione to tickle his bare shoulder. 
 
  With surprising speed for someone still half asleep, Theo trapped Draco’s hand in his own, tugging it securely under the duvet before Draco could protest. “It’s far too early to get up,” he grumbled. “Go back to sleep.”
 
  “It's half-past eight!” Draco countered, wriggling his hand free. “We’re due at Charlie’s at eleven!”
 
  “Exactly. There’s plenty of time. It’s much too early to wake up now.”
 
  Draco sighed. He ran his fingers through his bed mussed hair and stared at Theo in exasperation. “No, it’s really not. We need a proper breakfast before we leave. Come on, Theo! Picture it. Bacon and eggs, toast, beans, hash browns, you know Remus makes the best weekend breakfasts. No one should play Quidditch on an empty stomach, after all.” Draco tugged at the duvet, rolling his eyes as Theo continued to protest. “Come on! You need to eat a balanced meal. Your usual morning routine of two cups of coffee and a cigarette isn't going to cut it today.”
 
  Theo groaned, burying his head further into the pillow. “Whilst a full English breakfast sounds lovely, it also involves getting up. It’s warm in here, the bed’s soft, you two are in it,” he grinned, turning to look at Hermione while raising his eyebrows suggestively.
 
  She laughed as Draco growled in frustration. “No! I know from experience that you get grumpy when you're hungry. You're as bad with lack of food as you are with lack of sleep. Now, come
  
     on!”
  
   Draco said, leaning over to give the duvet a hard yank, “get up!”
 
  “Alright, Merlin, keep your hair on!” Hermione smiled as Theo finally relinquished the bed covers then rolled over to peer hopefully up at her. “Morning, love. I like it when you fuss over me, Draco. It makes me feel cared for.”
 
  “Good morning!” She accepted Theo's kiss with a smile, then sat up and checked the condition of her sleep rumpled hair. “We do try to take care of you, but It's proving quite difficult to get you out of bed today.”
 
  “That hair’s a lost cause,” Draco smirked as, unsurprisingly given her half hearted efforts to tame it, Hermione’s curls sprang out from underneath her hand, looking just as wild as they had before. “It nearly strangled me three times while you were asleep last night.”
 
  “Try it again tonight, sweetheart. If you tie him down, he might stop waking us up so damned early,” Theo grinned. “Come here. Give me a kiss.”
 
  “I don’t think we have time to kiss,” she protested, glancing guiltily at Draco, even as the base of her stomach twisted into a tight knot of desire.
 
  Theo stared at her, his blue eyes dark with lust. “There’s always time to kiss.” 
 
  Hermione laughed at Draco’s pained sigh then squealed as Theo took advantage of her hesitancy, flipped her onto her back and pinned her down on the mattress. He settled himself over her, straddled her with his knees then lowered his head until their lips met. 
 
  “One kiss, then. One! Oh, for heaven’s sake. I give up,” Draco grumbled as Theo slowly dragged his lips along her jaw, down her neck, and then lower still. Draco continued to shake his head as Theo lifted her t-shirt up and settled his mouth firmly around her left nipple. 
 
  Hermione hummed with pleasure as he sucked the soft bud into his mouth, and it pebbled instantly against his tongue. The cotton of her bunched up t-shirt felt rough against her sleep sensitized skin, so, as Theo continued his ministrations she glanced apologetically at Draco then pulled it off over her head. Draco closed his eyes in defeat, then nudged Theo over so that he could join in. “You’re both incorrigible,” he muttered as she lifted her hips in an unspoken invitation. 
 
  “Sorry,” she gasped, gazing up at him through her lashes. She closed her eyes fully, sighing in pleasure as he dipped his head, took her other nipple into his mouth and swirled his tongue gently over it. 
 
  “Stop fretting, Draco. As I said, there’s plenty of time for a little kiss. All Hermione’s got to do is tell me to stop, and I'll stop.” Theo tugged her shorts down her legs as he spoke, then stroked his fingers through her already slick folds. He moved his hand forward, then further back, and as she arched up to meet him, his thumb brushed over her sensitive back entrance, making her whimper and mewl until he lifted a questioning brow. “
  
    Do 
  
  you want me to stop, love?”
 
  In answer, Hermione rocked her hips, rubbing herself brazenly against his fingers. “Godric, no! Don't you dare!"
 
  Theo chuckled softly. "May I?” he asked, tapping his finger gently against her puckered hole.
 
  “Yes,” she whispered, savouring the waves of anticipation that were now coursing deliciously through her body. 
 
  Draco's breath ghosted softly over her skin as he slowly dragged his kisses back up to her mouth. She flinched as Theo whispered an incantation and the now familiar, cool, and slightly tingly gel slickened her back passage. Theo pressed his finger past her tight ring of muscle, and Draco swallowed the moan of pleasure she gave in response. She squirmed against them both, her body frantically seeking out more contact. Theo's finger felt good, but she wanted more. She wanted him to fully take her 
  
    there
  
  , but she wasn’t sure she was able to voice her request. “More,” she gasped, wriggling against him on the bed, “please!”
 
  “How much more?” Theo asked, carefully sliding a second finger in alongside his first. “Remember, we're only supposed to be having a little kiss.” Despite the position they were all in, Draco rolled his eyes theatrically, and Hermione laughed.
 
  “Well, in that case, I'll take as many of these 
  
    kisses
  
   as you’re willing to give me,” she said, still squirming against Theo’s fingers. 
 
  Theo smirked. “What if I said to hell with just kissing? What if I told you I wanted to watch Draco fuck your pretty little arse for the first time?”
 
  Hermione gasped, wondering if Theo had accidentally read her mind again. She kissed him with renewed passion, then smiled slowly, hoping to encourage him further. “Well, if you were to say that, I’d tell you both to go right ahead.”
 
  Theo’s eyes snapped shut as he groaned and dropped his forehead down onto her chest. She heard Draco draw a pained breath beside her, and she turned her head to watch him slide his boxer shorts down his legs. “Are you sure about this, love?” he asked. She nodded as Theo exhaled a ragged breath. “It should be you that does this for the first time, though, Theo, and me that watches. Assuming that’s okay with you both?”
 
  “I agree.” Hermione nodded then hesitated as a flash of doubt crossed Theo’s expressive face. “Unless you’d rather not, of course?”
 
  Theo wriggled his fingers, the ripple of sensation making her gasp. “Of course I want to, but Draco will be more gentle than I will-”
 
  “No,” Draco said, stroking his own straining erection, “I won’t be. You can be just as soft as I can, love. You do it all the time. You just don’t realise it." 
 
  Hermione nodded, staring into Theo’s wide, blue eyes. She reached for Draco, squeezing his hand in thanks. “Draco’s right,” she whispered. “I'd really like my first experience of this to be with you. I'd like you to do this for me now, Theo, then tonight I want both of you to take me together.”
 
  She lifted her hips in further invitation, mewling as Theo gently pulled his fingers free. He wiped the remaining lube off on the bedsheets, then added another layer of the preparation spell. “Ok. Promise me you’ll tell me if anything hurts, then. I want this to be perfect for you, which is why I think Draco might be better-”
 
  Draco silenced Theo by kissing his finger and touching it to his lips. “Stop worrying, love. My first time with a man was with you, and it was indescribably perfect,” he said softly.
 
  Hermione smiled, nodding as she lifted her hips off the bed once more. “Come get me, Theo,” she whispered,” I'm all yours."
 
   “Alright,” Theo smiled. “Thank you for having so much faith in me.” He skimmed his hand up her arms, grabbed both of her wrists and pinned them to the bed above her head. He used his other hand to stroke down her body, guiding her gently into the right position. His usually sharp eyes were soft and looked oddly emotional as he leaned down to brush his lips over hers.
 
  Hermione tried to keep her apprehension in check as Theo cupped her face and deepened their kiss. He released her hands then rubbed his fingers through her slippery folds, making her quiver with desire all over again. He lined himself up and nudged carefully against her until the tip of him slipped inside her with minimal resistance. He paused, still watching her carefully, then eased forward until the widest part of him entered her, and she tensed against the uncomfortable stretch. 
 
  "Relax, sweetheart,” he whispered, pulling back, then sliding slowly forward once again. “I've got you. It’s a strange feeling at first. If you don’t like it I’ll stop.”
 
  She nodded, pulling an errant lock of hair out of her mouth. “No, don't stop. It's good, It's just new. How is it for you?”
 
  “Tight,” He admitted, pausing once more to let her adjust to his unfamiliar intrusion. “It's tight but it also feels 
  
    divine
  
  . You don't know how long I've wanted to do this. I'm taking things slow for me as well as for you. If I move much faster than this, it’s all going to be over very soon.”
 
  Hermione grinned. “Oh, really?” As Theo carefully slid deeper, the slight stinging eased and she moved hesitantly until he finally bottomed out inside of her. She wasn't totally sure how she felt about the experience yet, so far, the reality of the act felt quite different from the way she had imagined it. So far, it wasn’t doing a great deal for her, but she did like the effect it was having on Theo and Draco. Theo was watching her reverently, while Draco was stroking himself with long rhythmic pumps and gazing at her through narrow, impossibly stormy eyes.
 Theo pulled steadily back, and she lifted her hips up to a different angle as he pressed inside her once again. Her eyes bulged wide as the change of position caused him to hit a spot that she hadn’t known existed, and suddenly everything changed. “Oh…..! Oh, Gods!” she gasped, her eyes rolling back into her head as he slid forward with a soft moan. “Mmmmmm!” she squealed incoherently as a myriad of silver lights popped behind her eyelids. “That’s why you both like this so much. Mmmm... Oh, that’s amazing…. faster, Theo….. I need, nngggg, please!” 
  Her body felt as if it had suddenly caught on fire. Her senses short circuited as Theo lengthened his thrusts until he was sliding his whole length in and out of her. Every move he made jostled the sweet spot he was hitting until it felt as if it might explode. 
 
  She nodded vaguely at Draco, unsure of what he was asking permission for until she felt his thumb brush over her clit. She squealed at the extra sensations, then let her head fall helplessly back into the pillow as his finger slid inside her slick walls. Draco alternated his movements with Theo’s, pressing his finger in as Theo withdrew, then sliding it almost all the way out as Theo entered her again. She moaned loudly as Draco added another finger, and the pressure grew even more intense. When Draco rubbed his thumb over her clit, it was almost too much for her to comprehend. 
 
  She felt dazed as both Draco and Theo continued to move inside of her. Her climax  built until her need for release almost became painful. Theo leaned forward to kiss her, and this latest change of angle caused the tip of his cock to bump against Draco’s fingers. The hard pressure, and the feeling of fullness from both sides tipped her over the edge and she cried out as her orgasm broke with an unusually sharp intensity and a release of fluid that she’d never felt before. 
 
  Hermione’s head fell back into the pillow as Theo pressed himself deep inside of her. She couldn’t think about what was happening, all she could do was surrender to the waves of white hot pleasure that were overtaking her, each one stoked higher by Draco, who was still massaging Theo through her inner wall. She felt Theo tense above her, and heard Draco give a strangled groan beside her as he jerked himself to completion, but she was powerless to respond. Trapped helplessly in place by what felt like a never ending orgasm, all she could do was pant with exhaustion as Theo finally eased himself down on top of her, inadvertently spreading Draco’s, and her own, release all over them both. 
 
  She opened her eyes, blinking as her dazed mind finally began to clear. Theo propped himself up on one elbow, and she smiled at the sight of him kissing Draco tenderly. “Are you okay?” she asked as Draco pulled back to stare at her in wonder. 
 
  “Yes.” Draco lifted his hand and she frowned, surprised to see that it was soaking wet. “You squirted all over my hand,” he said. “You actually squirted! Did you know you could do that?”
 
  “No!” she gasped, still reeling from the aftershocks of her momentous orgasm. “I... I had no idea! I’ve never done that before!”
 
  “Then I shall consider myself extremely honoured.” Draco stared at his hand for a moment longer then tapped Theo on the shoulder. “Are you alright, love? Only it’s not like you to ignore something like this!”
 
  Theo chuckled. “Lemme see that!” He lifted Draco’s fingers, gazed at them in amazement then sucked them boldly into his mouth. “Wow,” he said, releasing them with a pop, “that’s incredible, love. Yeah, I’m more than alright. That was 
  
    indescribable. 
  
  I love you.” He lifted himself up, kissed Hermione on the lips, then turned to do the same to Draco. “And I love you, too. I felt every move your fingers made, Draco. You were massaging me 
  
    through
  
   Hermione. Merlin, I knew the double penetration thing was meant to be good, but 
  
    fuck! 
  
  What a way to start the day!”
 
  “I love you both too,” Hermione whispered, suddenly feeling overcome with emotion. Her breath stuttered as she inhaled, and both Draco and Theo looked at her sharply.
 
  “And I love both of you as well,” Draco said, watching with concern as she tried to hide the tears that were inexplicably welling up in her eyes. “I was going to suggest we went for a shower, but sweetheart, what’s wrong?'' he asked, clearly worried by her shaken state. 
 
  Theo sat up then lifted her into his lap. He wrapped his arms around her, and held her tightly. “What’s the matter?” he asked, pressing kisses into her hair. "Tell us please."
 
  “I don’t know!” She answered honestly, still feeling bewildered. She forced her lips into a half-hearted smile, not wanting to cause either of the boys to worry more than they already were. “Nothing’s wrong,” she said, wiping away a tear. “But look, I’m shaking!” She held out a hand, watching incredulously as it trembled in front of her. “I don’t regret anything, please don’t think that. I wanted that so much. It was just," she paused, groping wildly around for the right words to describe her rioting emotions, "completely overwhelming. I’m fine,” she laughed rather wildly, the abrupt release of breath helping her body to calm. “Honestly, I am.” She wiped her eyes. “I don’t know why I’m crying. I’m so sorry.” She pressed her fingers against her eyelids as her frazzled brain finally began to settle.
 
  “I’d say that huge orgasm short circuited all of your senses,” Draco whispered, rubbing her back reassuringly. ”I had that happen once and it felt exactly the way you've just described. Remember, Theo? That time in the Slytherin dorms when you thought I’d passed out?” 
 
  Theo grimaced then nodded, gently stroking Hermione’s hair while Draco continued to soothe her back. “Yeah. I remember. Listen, sweetheart, there is 
  
    nothing 
  
  to apologise for. Okay? Are you sure we didn’t hurt you?” Theo asked.
 
  Hermione sat up as her brain finally settled back into its usual equilibrium. “You didn't hurt me in the slightest. In fact, that was one of the best experiences of my life.” She smiled. “It was just very, very intense. Thank you,” she whispered, accepting the tissue Draco gave her and gazing into his still concerned face. “I’m honestly okay, It's clearing fully now. Shall we get moving?”
 
  “Just wait a bit longer, please?” Draco asked, looking at her imploringly as she untangled herself from Theo’s arms, “until you're-”
 
  She shook her head as she stood up. “Honestly, there’s no need. Anyway, weren’t you worried about missing breakfast?” 
 
  Theo nodded, clearly feeling relieved. "If you're sure you're alright, then let's get moving. Since we’re all currently covered in come, and it seems rude to go downstairs like that, we’d better get in the shower. Are you 
  
    positive
  
   you're alright, love?”
 
  She nodded, Theo’s crude words making her laugh again. “Yes. I 
  
    promise.
  
   I’m perfect. Now come on, let's go, we’ve got a quidditch match to win!!”

  
  

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  

  The Welsh hillside was bathed in cool winter sunshine. Hermione bounced along on the back of Sirius’ motorbike, gripping onto his trim waist as if her life depended on it, which, she reasoned as they hit a pothole and both wheels of the bike left the ground, it probably did. “You know, Kitten, this bike’s much more comfortable when it’s in the air,” Sirius called over his shoulder. 
 
  Gritting her teeth as another, even larger bump lifted her right out of her seat, she closed her eyes and braced herself fully. “Go on then, just be carefuuuuul!” her last word turned into a shriek as Sirius revved the engine, and the bike suddenly shot skywards. Her stomach lurched and she bit back the admonishment that was on the tip of her tongue. Despite her terror there seemed little point in berating Sirius for his recklessness. Flying sedately was as alien a concept to him as it was to Harry or Draco. “What’s that now?” Sirius asked as she buried her face in his jacket, grounding herself with the reassuring smell of aged leather, sandalwood, and smoke. 
 
  “Nothing,” she called over the roar of the engine. She let out a long, controlled breath, forcing herself to relax as they continued to soar upwards. Despite her misgivings, it appeared that Sirius was right. Flying was a much more comfortable way to travel. They skimmed over the top of a small copse of trees, and Hermione smiled ruefully to herself, remembering what had gotten her into this situation in the first place. It seemed that 
  
    all
  
   of her friends had taken her desire to experience new things to heart.
 
  She was pleasantly surprised when they crested a small hill, and their temporary quidditch pitch came into view. Charlie, Sirius, and Remus had marked out a full size playing area, easily as big as the one at Hogwarts. It fully covered two large, flat agricultural fields and the hedgerow that separated them. They flew over the pitch boundary, and Hermione felt a soft wave of magic wash over her. “Privacy charm,” Sirius explained. “We had to hide the pitch from prying eyes.”
 
  She nodded, feeling rather impressed. Three goal hoops had been charmed to hover in the sky at each end of the pitch, and rather than painting directly on the landscape itself, shining, magically reflective pitch markings were hanging in the air about twenty feet above the ground. It was all very makeshift and rather wild looking, but Hermione thought it held a strange kind of beauty all of its own. It was the perfect pitch for their upcoming, game-deciding quidditch match. 
 
  Sirius nosed the bike toward the ground, and Hermione felt a quiet chuckle reverberate through his body as she gripped onto him with renewed vigour. She gritted her teeth as they touched down next to Theo, Draco, Charlie, and Remus, her whole body braced for an impact that didn’t ever arrive. 
 
  “Hello love. If you ever want me to do anything for you, just ask me while you're wearing motorbike leathers,” Theo shouted over the noise of the bike's engine.
 
  “Oh, you like this look, do you?” She smiled, pulling Remus’s jacket tightly around her body. She blinked coquettishly up at him, revelling in the effect her newfound confidence seemed to have.
 
  “I like you,” Theo countered, kissing her soundly. “But yes, I’ve always been partial to a woman, or a man, in leather.” He paused, furrowing his forehead as Sirius lifted a questioning eyebrow. “You or Draco in leather, I should say,” he clarified, watching a still chortling Sirius wave his explanations away. “Not that you don’t look wonderful in leather too, Sirius.”
 
  “Pads already knows he looks wonderful in leather,” Remus said, greeting Sirius with a kiss. “Did you survive the bike, Hermione?”
 
  “Yes, thank you!” She laughed as she passed Remus his jacket back, accepting the spare quidditch cloak that Draco handed her in its place. She grinned, feeling a small, unexpected shiver of pleasure when she turned her head and saw the name “Malfoy” spelled out in shining silver letters across her back.
 
  Sirius cut the bike’s engine with a smirk, then opened the hidden luggage compartment and took out a wicker crate, which emerged to be far larger than the small compartment it had been stowed inside. Sirius checked its fastenings, then lifted it easily onto the ground where it settled with a rather disproportionate thump. “Undetectable Extension Charm by any chance?” Hermione asked, using her hand to hide her smile.
 
  “Coupled with a Featherweight Charm?” Remus shuffled his feet awkwardly, “absolutely not.”  
 
  “Ex Defense Against the Dark Arts professors would never dream of using such illegal magic,” Sirius said while trying and failing to keep a straight face.
 
  “Don’t you dare touch those balls, Potter!” Draco warned as Harry joined them, opened the crate and peered inside. “I’m not having my winning catch disputed because you’ve activated the snitch’s flesh memory before the game begins!”
 
  “Winning catch? In your dreams, Malfoy!” Harry threw Draco an exasperated look but nevertheless stepped back from the basket with his hands raised. Hermione swallowed nervously as the two bludgers strained at their straps. They looked hideously aggressive, even securely buckled into their restraints. She took a deep breath, wondering if she was crazy to even consider taking part in this match. 
 
  To give herself some thinking space, she stepped away, walking towards a group of people who had just appeared in the sky, flying swiftly over the hill on broomsticks. “Hi Hermione,” Luna called, waving frantically as she swooped down into a graceful landing. 
 
  Hermione greeted Luna with a hug, then turned to embrace Parvati, who stepped up next, then Lavender, and then Hannah. “It’s so good to see you,” Hannah squealed in her ear. “It’s been so weird at school since you all left for the holidays. There’s been a whole heap of tension building up between everybody. All the eighth years have practically split into two opposing camps, it’s been quite horrible, really.” 
 
  “Oh no! Why?” Hermione asked, now hugging Padma Patil, who had been hanging back as if unsure whether she was supposed to be here or not. “That’s such a shame. I thought us leaving for the holidays might settle things down.”
 
  Hannah shook her head, her long blond ponytail flying and catching Luna on her wind pinkened cheek. “It 
  
    is
  
   such a shame, yes. If anything, your leaving made things worse because it upset the year group dynamics so much. The Ravenclaws have now banded together with the Hufflepuffs and that leaves us,” she waved a hand, indicating Luna, Parvarti, Padma, and Lavender, “and the boys,” she gestured towards Greg, Seamus, Dean, and Neville who had also landed and were greeting Pansy, Ron, and Millie, “out on our own. The Ravenclaws have rejected Padma and Luna because Padma stuck up for Parvarti, and Luna refuses to hear a word said against Theo, and the whole group shuns me because I’m seeing Greg. It’s all very sad. That's why we’ve brought Padma with us today. We didn’t want to leave her at Hogwarts on her own.”
 
  “I hope it’s okay that I’m here,” Padma asked, looking up shyly, “I’ll try not to get in the way.”
 
  “Of course it’s okay. You're more than welcome here,” Hermione asserted. 
 
  “We heard a rumour that part time school might be becoming an option?” Neville asked as they all walked toward the motorbike. “Pansy thinks we might be able to live outside of school and floo in each day?”
 
  “That's all being officially announced after Christmas. But yes, that’s going to become an option,” Hermione confirmed with a smile. Her friend's matching looks of relief only served to cement what she already knew. This enforced eighth year wasn't really working out for any of them. 
 
  “The pitch is all complete, and the goal hoops are perfect. Shall we finish choosing teams?” Blaise asked, landing his broom beside Ginny, both of them rubbing warmth back into their gloved hands as they greeted the newcomers.
 
  “Didn’t you already do that rather sneakily the other day?” Theo asked, striding over to join them. He looked around at the group of assembled students, hugged Luna, then gestured both Dean and Seamus to come to his side. 
 
  “We might have chosen our seeker and keeper the other day, yes,” Blaise said with a grin, beckoning Parvarti forward. “We're choosing the rest of our team now.”
 
  “You snooze you lose, Theo,” Ginny said with a grin. 
 
  “Hmmm,” Theo said while moving a still uncertain looking Padma to his side. “This is mad. Look, we’ve got such a random mixture of differently coloured robes, how the hell are we going to know where our teammates are in the sky?”
 
  “I’ve got a solution for that,” Remus said, looking up from the scoreboard he was pouring over with Charlie. “Once we’re divided up, we’ll transfigure your robes into yellow and blue. If you’re all playing in neutral house colours, you won’t feel quite so competitive, I’m sure.” 
 
  “Bugsy yellow then,” Blaise and Theo called at the same time. 
 
  Hermione eyed the pair of them curiously. She couldn’t help but feel that Remus was being rather optimistic. Calming Theo and Blaise’s competitive streaks seemed to be an impossible task. “Why do you both want to play in Hufflepuff colours?”
 
  Blaise turned his wide brown eyes onto her. “Because next to Slytherin, Hufflepuff is my favourite house, of course,” he said, blinking innocently.
 
  “Yellow is easier to see in the sky,” Theo said at the same time.
 
  “What they both mean,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes, “Is that no one will suspect dirty tactics from anyone playing in Hufflepuff colours. Isn't that right, Zabini, Nott?” Blaise said nothing while Theo pretended to be transfixed by a flock of crows that flew over, and Ginny used their moment of distraction to pull Millie and Pansy onto her and Blaise’s team. 
 
  Hermione bit her lip, watching Draco stare appraisingly at the remaining group of students. “Have any of you ever played in a quidditch match before?” he asked, and she added her own voice to the chorus of negative answers. “Right. Greg, Hannah, you go to Blaise. Neville, Luna, Lavender, you can be with us,” Draco continued, frowning as he counted heads. “Remus, we’ve got an uneven number of competitors. Would you be willing to play to even the numbers up?”
 
  “I thought I was going to referee!” Remus protested. “I've never really been much good at quidditch. Hey! Steady on, easy Pads!” Hermione laughed, as with a flash of shiny black fur, Sirius transformed into Padfoot and started playfully nipping at Remus’ ankles, tugging on the hem of his jeans with his teeth, and running play-bow interspersed rings around him. 
 
  For a few moments, pandemonium reigned. Padfoot continued making everybody laugh with his antics until Remus held up his hands in surrender and agreed to play. “Finally!” Sirius grinned, transforming back into his human form just as Fred, George, and Lee Jordan arrived, bringing with them a huge bag of sweet pastries from Diagon Alley. 
 
  Eventually, once all of the snacks were eaten, and the teams and playing orders were finalised, Fred and George both took spare brooms, happily accepting Charlie’s  request for them to act as referees, Lee took up his old position of match commentator, and soon, the only thing left to do was to decide on each team’s playing colours.
 
   “Heads or dragons?” Lee asked, flipping a galleon into the air. 
 
  “Dragons. We’re playing in yellow if I win this toss,” Theo said, grinning as the coin performed a showy quadruple flip then landed dragon side up in Lee’s hand. 
 
  Blaise conceded defeat with a pat to Theo’s arm. “Ah well. The hat briefly considered me for Ravenclaw, so I suppose I can live with that,” He grinned, shaking the hand Theo’s offered. 
 
  Ginny accepted Theo and Draco’s handshakes, then turned to hug Hermione. “All’s fair in love and quidditch, right, ‘Mione?” she grinned. “Okay! Our team over here, please!” 
 
  “And ours over here!” Theo called, waving his hand to indicate the other side of the pitch. 
 
  Obediently everyone split up. Remus transfigured their cloaks into the right colours, and Hermione looked down at her now canary yellow and black robes with a mounting feeling of trepidation. She watched as her team assembled around the crate of balls that Fred carried onto the centre of the pitch, suddenly feeling a renewed respect for Harry when he had taken over the captaincy of the Gryffindor team at Hogwarts. 
 
  As the time for the quaffle to be released approached, Hermione found herself becoming more and more nervous. Watching the final match preparations was like watching a carefully choreographed yet strangely foreboding dance. Draco checked off everybody’s positions, Seamus mounted his broom and flew away to cover their team’s goalposts, while Ron did the same for Blaise’s team. 
 
  Lee pointed his wand at his throat and cast a Sonorous Charm. “Beaters up,” he called, and Theo, Dean, Millie, and Remus rose up into the air.
 
  “Chasers up!” Lee shouted, and Hermione stared determinedly at the broom nestled between her thighs. She leaned carefully forward then blinked as she launched herself uncertainly into the sky, flanked by Sirius and Charlie on one side, and Pansy, Ginny, and Blaise on the other.
 
  “Seekers up!” Lee called, and Draco and Harry both kicked off. 
 
  The people who weren’t yet playing settled down on a set of camp chairs that had been conjured from fallen logs that Charlie had found in the forest. “Three. Two. One.” Fred threw the quaffle into the air as George released the bludgers from their crate, and Hermione blinked, frozen awkwardly in place as one of the large black balls pelted straight towards her. She stared at it, unable to move for a full second, then veered unsteadily out of its way as Theo dove in front of her and walloped it towards Blaise with his bat. 
 
  She gulped, flying steadily forwards as George released the snitch. The little gold ball zoomed skywards with the sunshine glinting jauntily on its tiny golden wings, and the game began. 

  
  
  
  
  
  

   

   

  
    Chapter Text
    
  “That’s a spectacular quaffle catch from Ginevra Weasley, a future quidditch star in the making, and if I may say so, an exceptionally pretty girl. Apparently, Ginny honed her flying skills by stealing her twin brother’s brooms from the family broom-shed and perfecting her flying skills in the dead of night-”
 
  Hermione chanced a sideways glance and chuckled at Fred, George, Ron, and Blaise, who were all gesticulating wildly towards Lee Jordan's makeshift quidditch commentary box. “Keep it professional,” Ron yelled, which only served to make Lee laugh. Hermione instantly regretted her slight lapse in concentration, turning her head had caused her to wobble alarmingly on her broom, and she tensed, staring wildly around while trying to regain her balance. 
 
  Playing in an actual quidditch match, Hermione was quickly finding, was even more terrifying than she had imagined it would be. She had no idea what she should be doing, so she was currently staying still, hovering uncertainly in the sky while the more confident players zoomed all around her at breakneck speed. She jumped as Harry pelted past, sparing her a bright grin as he continued his search for the snitch, then shivered in his broom-rocking tailwind, clutching tightly at her broom-handle in alarm.  
 
  She swallowed hard. This was very, very different to the impromptu, rather drunken match that she and the others had played at Hogwarts back at the start of the Cupid game. Back then, she had thoroughly enjoyed being perched on the front of Draco’s broom. His arms had been wrapped securely around her, and he was so practiced at flying that she’d felt safe in the air. 
 
  Today's match was a very different thing. 
 
  Suddenly finding herself alone as the other players followed Ginny to the Ravenclaw goal hoops, Hermione froze, watching Blaise break free from the group and speed directly towards her. She breathed a sigh of relief as, despite being a chaser, he performed the sky-bound equivalent of a handbrake turn and blasted a bludger that she hadn’t noticed safely out of her way with his wand. “You alright?” he asked, eyeing her with concern. 
 
  “Thanks. I think so,” she said, glancing at the array of yellow and blue robes that were once again flashing all over the sky. “Maybe. How on earth do you keep track of all this?” 
 
  “You don’t,” Blaise asserted cheerfully. “You're a chaser, like me. All we need to worry about is catching the quaffle and scoring goals. If you stay close to your beaters, they’ll worry about the bludgers for you since that’s their job, and you can just ignore Draco and Harry because they’ll do their own thing while they’re looking for the snitch. Give it a try. You never know, you might like it, but you need to get in where the action is. It’s more dangerous out here unprotected than it is in the thick of things. Look, see? They’re targeting us because we're out here on our own.” Blaise grinned as he sped off, spelling another bludger towards Pansy on his way. 
 
  Hermione wheeled around. She still had no idea what was happening at the other end of the pitch, but she was now determined to reach what sounded like relative safety by getting closer to the heart of the match. 
 
  “Aaaaand that's another goal for Ravenclaw! Well done, Parvati! Nice bludger-work by Blaise Zabini there, even though he’s not a beater. Wait, should we be penalising that? I suppose not since he’s probably just saved Hermione from a nasty injury. Ooooof, what a recovery from Pansy Parkinson, though! She just performed a perfect cartwheel to escape Zabini’s bludger. Watch out, Blaise, she looks a bit upset, I think she might be after you now!” 
 
  Determinedly, Hermione inched her broom forward. She gave up trying to pinpoint the quaffle in the sea of multi-colored robes and turned her broom towards the main group of players instead. She tilted her balance further forward, and the broom responded instantly, making her squeal as she shot forward erratically.
 
  Finally, she made it rather haphazardly into the main mass of players. “Catch, ‘Mione!” somebody called. She stretched out an arm, and much to her surprise, the maroon quaffle soared directly into her hand. “Now fly to the goals and shoot!” Sirius shouted, grinning broadly as he ducked Remus’ well aimed bludger. Hermione nodded, gritted her teeth as she swung around to face Ron, who was hovering at the far end of the pitch. 
 
  Players surrounded her as she started to fly forwards. She steered a careful course through the chaotic, colourful group, yelping as Pansy cut violently across her, forcing her to pull upwards to avoid a collision. She gasped as she found herself abruptly flanked by Theo and Dean, both of whom skidded close to her side and flew with their bats raised menacingly. “Go for it!” Dean yelled, swiping yet another bludger out of their way, "shoot!" 
 
  “Shoot, Kitten!” Sirius called, and she did, but despite Ron’s somewhat suspicious dive in the wrong direction, the quaffle fell short of the hoop. Sirius caught it from underneath, swerved to avoid Millie’s bludger, and threw it back to her. “Try again!”
 
  She did, and to her utter delight, this time the ball sailed straight through the centre hoop. “And that’s another goal to Hufflepuff, a debut goal from the one and only Hermione Granger, one of our new and wholly untested players. Well done, Hermione!” Lee shouted. “Although, frankly, I feel we should also be focusing on the Ravenclaw keeper’s abysmal attempt to save that goal. Come on, Ronnie, you can do better than that! Show us what you’ve really got!”
 
  Hermione laughed as Ron flipped Lee the finger, and Millie aimed her next bludger hard in his direction. Theo swooped down and returned the bludger to play, and as the game continued, Hermione finally managed to relax a little. The longer she played, the less she worried about falling off her broom, and the more she began to enjoy the match. She felt just as shocked as Ginny looked when, at one stage, she found herself racing her neck and neck for the quaffle. Ginny caught it, of course, but Hermione couldn’t help feeling proud of her own efforts as she braked gently then turned back to the main gaggle of players. 
 
  She lost track of the score and looked up in amazement when the whistle blew for the first round of refreshment breaks and substitutions. After a moment’s thought, she surprised herself, and given their looks of shock, everybody else around her, by electing to play on. Millie changed places with Greg, while Lavender took Seamus’ place, and the game continued. “You're doing so well,” Draco called, swooping past her as he scanned the sky for the long-unseen snitch. “You alright?” 
 
  She nodded, giving him a wide smile as he dodged the bludger that Greg sent hurtling his way. Theo and Greg both pelted after it, Theo flying at what appeared to be supersonic speed with Greg following more sedately in his wake. “Careful!” Draco gasped, reaching out a steadying hand as their tailwind caused Hermione to wobble perilously. “We should have had Greg on the school team. He’s not that quick on a broom, but no one will match him in power!”
 
  “Except for Remus, maybe,” Hermione agreed, nodding as Draco looked at her incredulously. “Moony’s incredibly strong, remember, and Remus can harness that power when he needs to.” She laughed as Draco’s eyes widened. “I’ve seen him do it. Believe me, it’s impressive.” 
 
  “I’ll bear that in mind,” Draco said. He blew her a kiss then spiralled away, still hunting for the elusive snitch. After another full hour of play, they had a further ten minute break for refreshments and another substitute swap, then Fred blew his whistle, and they kicked off once more. “Need to find that snitch,” Draco muttered, passing her in the now fading light.
 
  “What’s the score?” she asked, looking around at the darkening, thoroughly snitch-free sky. 
 
  “You don’t want to know,” Draco answered, looking grim. “We’re losing badly, mostly thanks to Ginny’s insane goal scoring ability and Lavender’s Merlin-awful goalkeeping. Ginny’s got to go professional after school, surely? She’s incredible on a broom.”
 
  “I think that’s what she wants to do. Oh wow!” Hermione’s jaw dropped as Ginny scored yet again, this time tucking the quaffle neatly under an unsuspecting Lavender’s left arm. Not content with scoring once, Ginny caught the quaffle on its way down, dodged Remus’ bludger and Charlie’s full bodied attempt to throw her off course, then looped around and scored once again. 
 
  “Fuck!” Draco swore. “Where the fuck is that fucking snitch?!” He sped off with renewed determination, using his hand to shield his eyes from the setting sun.
 
  “Duck!” Charlie called, and Hermione threw both herself and her broom wildly forward, narrowly avoiding the bludger that sailed over her head. 
 
  Thanks,” she gasped, as Theo skidded to a halt in front of her and whacked it safely away.
 
  Suddenly, she caught sight of the quaffle beneath her, dived without thinking and caught it. Ron looked utterly bewildered as she spun around on instinct, sped past him, and scored a perfect goal. 
 
  “Looks like Potter’s seen the snitch,” Lee called as Sirius whooped with delight and offered her a high five. Hermione gasped, looking around to see Harry and Draco racing each other through the sky like lightning. They were both leaning forwards on their brooms, goading each other as they flew flat out, the way she had seen them do so many times at Hogwarts. She held her breath, mesmerised by their skill. They were fairly evenly matched, and she couldn’t help rooting for both of them, even though she knew that a joint snitch catch was impossible. She hovered in the sky transfixed, the dangerous bludgers forgotten as she watched her boyfriend and her best friend fight for dominance in their race. It was impossible to tell who was going to win. Draco had the height advantage, but Harry was the more reckless flyer. She squealed as Harry edged ahead of Draco, flattening himself against his broom handle, still flying like the wind. 
 
  Hermione squealed as she finally noticed what Harry and Draco were competing for. The tiny snitch was fluttering in the wind, flying just above their outstretched hands. Draco stretched his arm out further, trying to avoid Harry, who was elbowing him frantically in an attempt to distract him. “Dirty tricks from a Gryffindor,” Theo said as Harry swerved and caused Draco to falter. “Who’d have thought?!”
 
  Hermione gasped as Draco wobbled, then grabbed hold of Harry’s broom tail. Fred blew his whistle as Harry bucked his broom handle, catapulting Draco off and sending him spiralling perilously away. Draco’s forbidden tactic worked. In the ensuing confusion the snitch disappeared from sight once more. Draco dropped down to high five Theo, laughing while Fred awarded Pansy a penalty in return for his foul, and Lee complained about Slytherin house playing dirty no matter what colour their team robes were. Draco saluted the commentary box, Pansy scored yet another goal for Ravenclaw, and the game continued. 
 
  It took another twenty minutes for the snitch to reappear. Draco dived abruptly, this time with Harry on his tail, but Dean was ready for them. He lifted his bat and whacked a bludger right into Harry’s path. Harry swerved, but the split second it took for him to regain his flightpath allowed Draco to close his fingers around the tiny, fluttering golden ball.
 
  “Did you get it?” Theo yelled as Draco spiralled down to the ground with his hand raised in triumph. 
 
  “Course I did,” Draco laughed as Theo leapt on him the moment his feet touched the ground. The rest of their team landed, and Draco was immediately swamped by people intent on congratulating him. He was still grinning when Hermione finally walked towards him on broom-wobbly legs. 
 
  “Well done!” She shrieked in surprise as he lifted her off her feet and spun her around joyfully. “What does that mean for the scores? Who won?”
 
  “Neither team,” Lee grinned. “You won’t believe this, but the match was an exact draw.”
 
  “A draw?” Theo shouted from beside them. “An actual draw? Again?! Are you serious?!” 
 
  “Yep,” Lee said, magicking the scoreboard into the air and pointing at it with his wand. “Your team had eighty goal points, and Blaise’s team had two hundred and thirty goal points. The snitch catch is worth one hundred and fifty points. If you add one hundred and fifty to eighty, you get two hundred and thirty. Therefore both teams have an even score of two hundred and thirty points.”
 
  Blaise and Theo stared at each other incredulously. Theo shook his head, while Blaise gave an incredulous laugh. “Settle this with quidditch, you said,” Theo laughed. “Quidditch will decide the whole Cupid game, you said!”
 
  “Well, what are the chances of this happening?!” Blaise grinned. “I suppose we’re going to have to accept that the game wants us to draw for the title now, aren’t we?”
 
  “I think we’re going to have to.” Theo held out his hand. Blaise took it and pulled Theo in for a tight hug. “Joint first place, then?” Theo asked, and Blaise nodded as Theo added his other arm to the embrace. "Thank you for looking out for Hermione up there," he said, “I appreciate that.” 
 
  Blaise nodded. “No problem. You'd have done the same for Gin, had she needed it.” 
 
  "I would," Theo confirmed. When they finally pulled apart, Blaise shook Draco’s hand before hugging him, then pulled Hermione close while Ginny embraced first Draco, and then Theo. 
 
  “I told you the game wanted joint winners this year,” Sirius said, hugging Hermione the moment Blaise let her go. “I have to say, Moony and I are impressed with ourselves. We had an inkling that the Cupid game might have been semi-sentient, but it’s just shown intelligence on a level that even we weren’t expecting!”
 
  “What with the sentient Cupid game and the sentient Marauders Map, I think you all did pretty well for a group of teenage inventors,” Hermione said, laughing as Ginny tugged her close for a hug of her own. 
 
  Sirius nodded. “I think we did, too. It was mostly Moony’s genius that created the game, and the map, for that matter. The man’s magic is on another level. James and I had a little bit of input, and he who we won’t name here, just came along for the ride. Anyway, that’s enough of all that. Who’s coming back to Grimmauld for a post match celebration? I think we’ve earned one, don’t you?”

  
  

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  

  “Come on. You know you want to!” Theo said, patting his broom handle enticingly. 
 
  “Do you know how much time I’ve spent in the sky already today? Hermione replied, the protest sounding half-hearted even to her own ears.
 
  Theo grinned. “Lots. You must be getting used to it up there now. Come on, beautiful, just a few minutes more? For me, please? You too, Blondie. In fact, Draco, why don't you come up with me, and we’ll let Charlie take Hermione up on his broom?”
 
  “Oh come on then," Hermione smiled, cupping Theo’s wind-cold cheek in her warm hand and pressing a kiss to his lips. "You know I can’t say no to you.” Still smiling, she stepped over the handle of Charlie’s broom, waited while he adjusted the handlebar so that he could hold it with his arms around her and gazed at Draco in amusement. “What about you, Draco? Are you coming up to feed the dragons with us?”
 
  “Something tells me I’m going to regret this,” Draco muttered, eyeing the duffle bags that both Charlie and Theo were holding with trepidation. “I’ll come up, but I’m not feeding anything. This is an honour in itself, Theo. The last person I rode pillion on a broom with was Harry, and that was back when he dragged me out of the fire in the Room of Requirement. I like to be in control when I fly.”
 
  “Well, you trust me to take the reins in other areas. In fact, you ask me to most of the tim-” Theo started to argue, but Charlie purposely kicked off into the sky, and Hermione missed anything else Theo might have said. 
 
  It was almost dark now. The sun was painting the sky a thousand shades of orange and pink as it slowly sank out of sight beyond the faraway horizon. The night was cold, and frost crystals were already sparking on the bare tree branches below them. Charlie flew swiftly, the dirty duffle bag settled securely on Hermione’s lap. She gasped as they sped towards the inky black expanse of apparently endless sea, with the dragons already flying in circles above their heads. “Call them, Theo,” Charlie shouted over his shoulder, and Theo cupped his hands around his mouth and made that odd, haunting cry that Hermione had previously heard Charlie use. 
 
  “Oh no!” Draco muttered loudly as Charlie dropped back and instructed him to get the meat out of the rucksack. “No. Theo, we need to get out of here. No fucking way am I hand feeding dragons!”
 
  “Come on, Draco,” Charlie grinned, tossing a sheep's leg at him. “It’s going to be fine. Hold it up or they’ll just come down and pluck it out of your lap.”
 
  “What?!” Draco shrieked, catching the sheep's leg and staring at it in horror as Theo laughed and Hermione took out a leg of her own. 
 
  “Ready?” Charlie asked. Hermione nodded, nervously holding the woolly leg aloft. “Keep the food coming. There’s only us tonight, so we’ll need a constant stream as they fly over.”
 
  Hermione gasped as the first dragon plucked the meat straight out of her hand. She grabbed a second leg out of the bag and held it up just in time for the next dragon. She counted fifteen dragons in all, flying in one after the other. Some were gentle and took their supper delicately. Some just grabbed the meat in their vicious looking claws as they hurtled overhead. Hermione watched them, mesmerised by their smooth, vulnerable underbellies. Despite the obvious difference in their personalities, all of the dragons were without exception, stunningly beautiful. 
 
  Hermione chanced a glance at Draco and Theo as the last of the dragons flew towards them. Theo was holding the broom with one hand while steadying Draco’s arm with his other, and all the while he was whispering soft reassurances in his ear. Despite still looking rather concerned, Draco was doing exactly as Theo said. 
 
  “That's the last one,” Charlie smiled, watching the final, iridescent green dragon disappear over the cliff and into her nest. “Are you ready to go to Grimmauld?”
 
  “Yep,” Theo grinned. “Hold tight, Draco.”
 
  “Do you trust me,” Charlie asked, turning to look appealingly at Hermione.
 
  “I, uh, yes. I think so,” she agreed, wondering why he would ask such a thing. Of course, she trusted him. He was a Weasley, even if he was by far the most reckless one, and she trusted them all implicitly. “I mean, I’m on a broom with you, over the sea, and we’ve just been hand feeding dragons, so, I guess so.”
 
  “Good. In that case, hold on to me tightly!” Frowning in confusion, Hermione did as he asked. A scream escaped her lips as Charlie wrapped his arms around her, then twisted, apparating them straight out of the sky. For a couple of seconds, every ounce of breath was abruptly squeezed out of her, then she doubled over, gasping for air and coughing from the brief suffocation as she landed in the brightly lit kitchen of Grimmauld Place. 
 
  Charlie laughed at the scandalised look she gave him as he released her, adjusted the broom he was still holding then tugged the empty duffle bag out of her ironclad grasp. “What?!” he laughed, bopping her cheekily on the nose and sauntering away as Theo and an equally dumbfounded looking Draco landed beside them. 
 
  “Mate, you look like you’ve seen a ghost,” Blaise said, peering at Draco in concern. “You alright?”
 
  Draco blinked, clearly struggling to gather his bearings after the abrupt apparation.  “Blaise, we just apparated here. From a broom. While we were flying over the sea in Wales,” Draco said slowly. “Where we were hand-feeding dragons. Dragons took sheep’s legs out of my hand. I’m still holding the broom, look, and uuuugh, I’m covered in blood! Theo, for 
  
    heaven's sake!
  
   I swear you're getting more irresponsible by the day!”
 
  “Possibly.” Theo grinned, wiping his hands on his jeans as Sirius offered them all a glass of wine. 
 
  “Drink, Kitten?” Sirius asked, and Hermione laughed as she exchanged a glance with Draco and they both nodded at the same time. 
 
  “Yes, please. Make it a large one, will you? I think I’m traumatized.” Draco shook his head, and stared at Sirius, apparently hoping to receive some kind of moral support.
 
  Sirius merely threw his head back and laughed. “Bless your heart, Draco. You'll get used to life at the sanctuary. Re, chuck the whisky over, will you? It looks like it’s needed over here.” 
 
  “That does sound very traumatic, darling. Come and sit down.” Pansy guided Draco into a chair at the table then sat down beside him. She cast a scourgify charm over his hands, frowned, then pointed her wand at the stairs, causing a pale blue case to hurtle into the room and straight into Harry’s hand. 
 
  “Shame you couldn’t have done that with the snitch earlier, eh, Potter?” Draco asked, ignoring Pansy’s eye roll. 
 
  “Watch your cheek, Draco,” Pansy scowled as she unzipped the case and took out a tube of hand cream. She uncapped it, then squirted a blob out onto his palm. “That's my boyfriend you're teasing.” Despite her warning, she began to massage the sweet smelling lotion all over his hands. 
 
  “Foods here,” Remus called, peering through the window that had been charmed to show the streetlamp lit square outside. “Someone better meet the delivery driver in the road or he’ll never find the house.”
 
  Hermione ignored the flurry of ensuing activity, Ron and Greg dashed upstairs to answer the door, Ginny set plates to soar out of the cupboard and onto the table, while Neville and the others who weren’t usual visitors to Grimmauld place stood around the room looking slightly bemused. “Come on you lot, relax,” Sirius said, pouring more drinks while introducing himself properly to Padma, even though they had been playing quidditch together all afternoon. “Sit down, make yourselves at home.” 
 
  Neville blinked as Sirius handed him a glass of red wine, and Hermione set a hand on his shoulder. “Are you alright?” she asked, steering him towards a spare chair at the table.
 
  “I think so,” Neville replied, rubbing his arm where a large, bludger-inflicted bruise was already blooming in shades of deep red and purple. 
 
  “Have you got any bruise salve in there, Pansy?” Hermione asked, nodding towards the blue case, the contents of which were now strewn haphazardly across the table Ginny was still laying.
 
  “Yep,” Pansy nudged a small pot towards Hermione before returning her attention to Draco’s fingers.
 
  “Thanks,” Hermione said, feeling slightly bemused by the attention that Pansy was giving Draco. To distract herself, she unscrewed the pot, took out a scoop of the thick, unpleasant-smelling, green paste, and started to rub it gently into Neville’s injured arm.
 
  “Alright, Pans.” Draco flexed his newly moisturisred fingers and turned to fix her with the full force of his stormy grey stare. “What's all this about? It’s not that I’m ungrateful, Merlin knows you give a good manicure, but I know you. You don’t do anything without a reason. What are you after?”
 
  Pansy paused long enough for Hermione to turn her head, curiosity stopping her from  ignoring what was happening any longer. Pansy hid a smirk by rummaging in her case for a nail buffer. “You know me too well, darling. Alright, I’ll level with you. I need a loan.”
 
  “A loan?” Draco arched his eyebrows, managing to look both amused and disdainful at the same time. “Of how much?”
 
  Pansy shifted in her seat as Theo perched on the corner of the table beside her,  pointedly examining his own, dirt stained hands. “Oh wait your bloody turn will you?” She used her thumb and forefinger to gingerly inspect Theo’s nails then frowned. “And give them a thorough wash first. They’re filthy, Theodore! I’m not entirely sure yet,” She continued, now buffing Draco’s nails to a high gloss shine. 
 
  Pansy took a deep breath as the room fell silent. “I was speaking to Fred and George today and they want to set up a cafe in the joke shop. They’re expanding into the shop next door too, and they think that having in-shop refreshments will encourage customers to stay longer and to buy more. I asked if they’d take a chance on letting me run the cafe. I told them I plan to take up the part time Hogwarts option, and that I could work for them in my spare time. I said I could start by selling cakes and buns from the main shop counter. That way, I wouldn’t have to be there all the time just yet, and that I could open it up full time in July when our NEWTS are over. They said yes! I’m over the moon, but now I need to buy my startup equipment. So, since Harry is entirely clueless about what he has in the bank, and I’ve been both financially and personally disowned by my own family, I wondered who else I could ask for a loan.” Pansy paused, looking up at the ceiling while stroking her chin in mock confusion. “Then I thought about my very best friend in all of the world, and I wondered if he might have a couple of spare galleons that he could lend me-”
 
  Draco rolled his eyes. “You know I do. But I’m not giving you a loan, Pans. I’ll buy your startup equipment as a thank you for putting up with me through sixth and seventh years.” 
 
  Pansy bit her lip, unable to hide her genuine smile. “I only need a loan, Draco-” she said, dropping her pretences and meeting his gaze honestly. “Just a temporary loan. I don’t expect you to fund my-”
 
  “Shut up and take the money, Pansy,” Theo asserted, returning to the table with freshly scrubbed hands. “We want a lifetime's worth of free manicures though. Pedicures too-”
 
  “No!!!” Pansy shrieked, making Neville jump. “Hell no! No bloody way. Not feet. I do 
  
    not
  
   touch other people’s feet!”
 
  Harry nodded gravely, sitting down opposite them. “That’s true. She won’t even touch mine. I’ve told you, we can investigate the Potter vaults if it helps, Pans. I mean, I probably should do that anyway,” he glanced sideways at Sirius who arched an eyebrow and nodded. “I’ve never even looked in them.”
 
  “Never even looked!” Theo spluttered. “Heavens above, Harry, that’s the first thing I’d have done! Okay, fine,” Theo rolled his eyes. “Pansy. Free manicures and free lunches too, if you won’t touch our feet. How does that sound?”
 
  “Come on, Pans. What do you say?” Draco asked, inspecting his finished hands. “Let me buy this for you. I was a nightmare a few years back, and this way I’ll feel like I’ve gone some way towards making that up to you.”
 
  “You were pretty awful,” Pansy agreed, looking at him while biting her lip and failing to keep her laughter at bay.
 
  “He really was,” Harry interjected from across the table.
 
  “I was about to disagree there, but actually Draco, I can’t.” Theo grinned. “You were a fucking nightmare. Even I struggled to put up with you.” 
 
  “Sod the lot of you, then.” Draco smiled, holding out his hand for Pansy to shake. 
 
  Pansy smiled, then paused. “Wait. All teasing aside, Draco, are you sure about this?” she asked hesitantly. “I really was only asking for a loan. I didn’t expect you to-”
 
  Draco nodded. “I’m positive.”
 
  With a loud pterodactyl-like screech, Pansy abruptly launched herself into Draco’s lap. “Oh Merlin, Draco, you are the actual best! Thank you so much! See, Harry? Isn’t he brilliant? I keep telling you he’s amazing!”
 
  Harry nodded. “I’m starting to feel convinced. Thanks, mate,” he said, shaking Draco’s hand around a still squealing Pansy. 
 
  Hermione looked up at Theo and laughed at his affectionate eye roll. “It looks like everything’s finally starting to work out for us all, doesn’t it?” She asked. Theo nodded and feeling rather emotional herself, Hermione returned her attention to a second, angry looking bruise that was forming on Neville’s arm. 
 
  “I’m going to take a Herbology Mastership alongside my NEWT’s,” Neville said in a quiet voice. “Professor Sprout is going to train me in it personally. She spoke to me about it at the start of the year, and I said it would be too much to take on with all my other subjects, so I asked her if I could come back to do it next year. But, if I can drop Charms and Astronomy, then bringing my mastership forwards becomes a workable option. Professor Sprout wants to retire in a couple of years, and get this,” Neville, smiled, his handsome face alight and his brown eyes shining with pride. “She thinks that once I’m properly trained I could apply to take over the Herbology Professor’s position.” He paused, his eyes now clouding over dreamily. “Professor Longbottom. Can you imagine it?”
 
  “Yes,” Harry said decisively from across the table. “I can. And your parents and your Gran will be very proud of you for it, too.”
 
  “Thanks, Harry,” Neville said, squeezing his eyes shut as he nodded. “I appreciate that.”
 
  “Good for you, Nev,” Theo grinned, toasting him with his glass of Merlot. “You always were the best at Herbology.”
 
  “Thanks!” Neville’s cheeks pinkened under the praise. He smiled as he watched Pansy finally disentangle herself from Draco then pick up Theo’s hand. 
 
  Hermione lifted her own glass to join Harry’s toast. “It’s perfect, Neville. Well done. I’m going to do it too,” she announced, standing up in a rather dramatic fashion. “It seems pointless having a whole string of NEWTs in subjects I’m never going to use. I’m going to drop potions and take up Remus’ offer of studying werewolves in my free time.” She frowned as Pansy and Theo laughed. “What?!”
 
  “Well, that’s hardly dropping a string of subjects, is it, love? Potions is one subject!” Theo softened his face then edged around to lean over the back of her chair while keeping his hand in Pansy’s grip. “But that’s fine, if you’re comfortable doing that, then that’s great. Why Potions, anyway?”
 
  Hermione laughed. “Because Potions is my most practical subject, and I prefer the theoretical ones. If I’m honest, Potions stresses me out more than all my other classes combined. You lot are all great at it, and you all do your best work when you don’t follow the official recipes. Slughorn says that successful potioneers have a natural flair for the subject. He says that making a potion should be an instinctive thing, and I just don’t have that instinct. If someone gives me a set of instructions or a recipe to follow, then I want to follow it to the letter, and it stresses me out when I have to deviate from it. Nope, I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to drop Potions and study werewolves instead.”
 
  “I. Love.You.” Theo said, dropping kisses down into her wind-wild hair. “I love that you're so different from me. Do it. I am,” he paused to glance around the room, “
  
    we
  
   are all totally behind you.”
 
  “That we are,” Harry agreed. 
 
  “Me too,” Ron confirmed, thumping a whole heap of takeaway bags down on the table and looking up as Greg added a lot more. “Whatever 
  
    it 
  
  is. I mean I’ve missed the entire conversation, but I didn’t really need to hear it. If you're doing a thing, Mione, then I’m backing it.”
 
  “Which is how things have always been, really. Isn’t it?” Harry asked.
 
  Feeling somewhat overcome, Hermione nodded. “Yes. It is. Except that now it's even better than it’s always been because we’re all in this together. As one big, enormously supportive family.” 
 
  She looked around the busy kitchen, at Dean and Seamus, who were holding hands while chatting to Padma and Parvarti, at Sirius, who was helping Remus to gather cutlery, at Luna, who was now examining Draco’s freshly manicured hands, at Millie, Blaise, and Ginny, all of whom were helping Ron to unpack the food bags, at Neville, dear sweet Neville who was apparently now tipped to become the next Hogwarts professor, at Hannah, Greg, and Lavender, at Pansy, who was now frowning at Theo’s bitten nails, at Charlie, and Fred and George, and Lee who were all busily rifling through the second set of takeaway bags, and she sighed happily. 
 
  The bonds they had formed over the past few weeks now felt unshakable. Their friendships were deep and real. They had survived a war, and its aftermath all together, and she knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that nothing would split them up now. 
 
  Hermione knew, without anybody telling her, that things were going to be okay. She was home, and she was safe. She had finally found her place in the magical world.

  
  
  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    
  “Hey, beautiful,” Draco said, joining Hermione at the edge of the fairy-light strung patio later that evening.
 
  “Hi,” she greeted him with a broad smile, then leaned out through a gap in the drapes, sighing with relief as the frosty air tickled her uncomfortably hot skin. 
 
  “Come back inside, you crazy witch. It’s freezing out there!” Shaking his head, Draco took her hand and tugged her back inside the magically warmed canopy.
 
  “That was the whole point! I was cooling myself down,” she protested, blowing her hair away from her still damp forehead. “I got rather hot dancing with the others in the lounge, so I came out for some fresh air.” 
 
  Draco nodded. “I see.” He lifted his hand and cast a cooling charm over her. “Better?”
 
  “Much. Thank you,” she admitted with a smile. “You know, I’ve been a witch for almost a decade, and I still forget I can use magic sometimes.”
 
  Draco grinned. “It’s lucky you’ve got me to remind you, then.” He canted his head and lifted an eyebrow, silently questioning her intense expression. “What’s wrong?” He asked, rubbing his thumb gently over her palm. 
 
  A blush crept over Hermione's cheeks as she realised she was staring blankly at him. She jolted, choosing to look down at their joined palms instead. “Nothing’s wrong. I was just noticing how pretty you are.” 
 
  Draco set his drink down on the window ledge then ran his spare hand through his dishevelled hair. The white blond strands fell back into stubborn disarray, hanging low over his forehead and catching on his eyelashes as he blinked. Hermione smiled, the slightly scruffy look suited him. The stars from the magically charmed roof reflected softly in his eyes, and as he stepped closer to her she inhaled, breathing in his familiar and intoxicating scent. 
 
  “You’ve known me for almost a decade, and you’ve only just noticed I’m pretty?” he arched his brows even higher, a hint of the smirk she had once so despised tugging at his lips. “Or is that something else you're prone to forgetting? Is this another thing I need to remind you of?”
 
  “I’ve noticed your good looks plenty of times before now, as you well know.”  Hermione playfully hooked her fingers into the cowl neck of his cashmere sweater and pulled him a step closer. “I happen to think you're a very beautiful man.”
 
  “What about rugged and handsome? Or are those adjectives reserved for Theo?” Draco asked, slowly tracing his fingers slowly along her jawline.
 
  “That’s more Theo. You’re too elegant to be rugged.” 
 
  Hermione laughed as Draco pulled a face then shrugged as if grudgingly accepting her compliment. “Is that a good thing?” He moved a step closer, effectively trapping her against the wall of the gazebo, and Hermione shifted forwards, pressing herself against the unmistakable bulge in his jeans. She steadied herself against him as he rolled his hips, the dominant move causing her knees to give way. “Do you want to get out of here for a bit?” 
 
  Her teeth sank into her bottom lip as she caught the suggestion in his voice. “Yes," she replied. "To both questions.”
 
  Draco eased his knee between her thighs, and she gasped as his leg brushed firmly against her core. She rocked her hips forwards, mewling as he buried his face in her hair. “Do you still want me and Theo to fuck you together tonight?” he whispered.
 
  Hermione’s breathing stuttered erratically as Draco kissed her earlobe. “Yes,” she replied, “I really do. But only if you both want that too?”
 
  Draco drew back, looking amused. “What do you think?” He kissed his way down her neck then bit sharply into her sensitive skin, making her squeal quietly in response. He chuckled, lowering his arms then pulling her snugly into his chest. “I want that very much indeed. And so does Theo.”
 
  “Merlin, you two! Get a bloody room!” Fred grinned as he swept past them on his way to join George. “Enough of these public displays of affection. ‘Mione, you’re our adopted sister, and this is as bad as seeing Ginny and Blaise snog each other’s faces off! Go on now, shoo!” 
 
  Hermione laughed as Fred flapped his hands, doing such a good impersonation of Molly Weasley that Charlie, George, and Ron all turned around in alarm. ”Shall we do as he suggests?” Draco whispered. “Can I take you and Theo up to bed?”
 
  Hermione nodded, hoping her blush wasn’t too obvious in the artificial light. “Where is Theo?” she whispered, turning to scan the patio. “I haven’t seen him for a while.”
 
  “Over there,” Draco pointed to the main table where Theo sat with Sirius, Remus, Charlie, Neville, Ron, and Greg. Hermione followed Draco across the chair-strewn patio, avoiding the knowing look that both Sirius and Fred gave her on the way. Draco crouched down to speak to Theo, and although she didn’t catch his words, Theo's eyes locked onto hers, and his look of pure, unbridled desire gave her a good idea of what Draco had said. 
 
  “Have fun, you three,” Sirius’ eyes twinkled, and his broad grin made Hermione blush yet again.
 
  Theo smirked. “Oh, we will.” He downed the rest of his firewhiskey, took a last drag of his cigarette, vanished the end, then took both Draco and Hermione’s hands in his. Ron winced, and Neville stared hard at the table as Theo turned to Remus. “Are the anti apparation wards still down?” he asked. Remus nodded, and Hermione gripped Theo’s hand tightly, clinging on through the oppressive darkness and landing laying down, with her head on the pillow of their oversized bed.

  
  
  
 
  
  
  

  “That was an impressively precise landing,” Hermione said, pulling herself up into a sitting position. 
 
  “I’m an impressive wizard,” Theo replied, standing up with a grin and wiggling his eyebrows at Draco, who gave an affronted huff. “Don’t look so put out, Draco. At least I didn’t apparate you out of mid-air this time.” Theo laughed, backing into the bathroom as Draco rolled his eyes. “There. See? You’re fine. Now, I need to freshen up. Let me watch you two kiss while I do it.”
 
  Draco shook his head in further exasperation, then smiled at Hermione. “Shall we?” he asked.
 
  She nodded, scooting across the bed, her eyes fixating on Draco’s bare stomach as he pulled his sweater off and the T-shirt he was wearing underneath rode up with it. She blinked in surprise as he straightened it out, emblazoned with the emblem of a muggle heavy metal band, she knew it had to be one of Theo’s. “I’m embracing a more casual look,” Draco explained as Theo attempted to wolf whistle through a mouthful of toothpaste. 
 
  “I like it,” Theo nodded. “It makes you look deliciously rebellious.”
 
  “I agree,” Hermione smiled. “And what's more, I seem to have a 
  
    thing
  
   for rebellious bad boys now.”
 
  Theo raised both his eyebrows, his toothbrush stilling as he smirked. “That’s very convenient.”  
 
  “Hermione told me I was beautiful earlier,” Draco said. “Pretty too. I had to concede rugged to you, though Theo, although I do happen to agree with her on that.”
 
  Theo spat into the sink, ran the tap then wiped his mouth with a towel. “So, Draco gets elegant and beautiful. I get rugged, that’s two to one. What other descriptions do I get, darling?” he asked, toeing off his shoes then strolling towards the bed.
 
  “Stop fishing for compliments!” Hermione laughed, watching him drop the towel, and then his clothes, into a heap on the floor. “You’re very handsome, but you’re also very untidy.”
 
  “Reckless, impulsive,” Draco stared up at the ceiling as if thinking hard, “a whole heap of trouble, gorgeous, sexy as fuck-”
 
  “Now that’s more like it.” Theo stepped forward then took hold of the front of Draco’s T-shirt, using it to tug him closer. “I like your new look.”
 
  “Good,” Draco closed his eyes, melting into Theo’s heated kiss.
 
  Hermione inhaled shakily as Theo released Draco and advanced on her instead. He cupped her face with his hands, then slid them backward, tangling his fingers into her hair. He leaned forwards, pressing his lips to hers, gently at first, then as their kiss deepened, he pulled her tightly against him, his lips crushing hers as he hungrily devoured her mouth. 
 
  Theo slid his hands down her body, hooked them under her thighs, and lifted her up, making her squeal. “Do you want to know how I’d describe you?” he asked, setting her on her feet then helping her start to undress. She nodded curiously, watching Draco tug his boxer shorts down his legs. “Exquisitely beautiful. Mind-blowingly intelligent. Exceptionally kind-hearted-”
 
  “Gorgeous. Brave as hell,”  Draco added with a smile. “Perfect in every way-”
 
  “Thank you,” she laughed as she cut him off, pointlessly fighting another blush. “Although, I’m fairly sure I’m not perfect.”
 
  Theo smirked. He stroked a finger over the gusset of her panties then raised an eyebrow. “Merlin, love. You're soaked already.” He swiped his finger back and forth before pressing it to Draco’s lips. “Here, have a taste of her, Draco. Isn’t she divine?”
 
  Draco nodded, licking Theo’s finger clean. “Perfect. As always. Now, we need you to tell us exactly what you want from us tonight.”
 
  Hermione took a deep breath. For some reason the thought of voicing her desires didn’t seem as embarrassing as it usually did tonight. Maybe the wine she’d drunk earlier in the evening had emboldened her, or perhaps it was her newfound confidence, she wasn’t sure, but either way, she suddenly felt able to speak about her fantasy without her usual embarrassment. “I think you know what I want," she began, "but in case there’s any doubt, I'll clarify it. I’d like you both to take me together, at the same time. I don't know the specifics of positions, or how it will all work, so I’d like you to take charge, Theo. I want you to guide me through this the way that you and Draco have guided me through everything else. But I don’t want either of you to worry about any of it. I’ll tell you if we need to stop or pause, and I want you both to do the same.”
 
  Theo licked his lips then looked at Draco, who nodded. “I promise to do that,” he agreed. 
 
  “Good. What about you, Draco?”
 
  “Of course,” Draco confirmed, trailing his fingertips across Hermione’s bare stomach and making her shiver. “I promise. Where do you want us, then, Theo? You know I love it when you take control too, so you’ve got the pair of us completely at your mercy.”
 
  Theo smiled. “One of these days, you’ll realise that’s the other way around. It’s 
  
    me
  
   who is completely at 
  
    your
  
   mercy. But, right now. I’d like you on your back, Draco. Move forward until you can hook your legs over the end of the bed. That's it,” he said, watching Draco shuffle into position. Now, Hermione. Come here. Let me take those pretty knickers off. Then you can hop up and straddle him.” 
 
  Hermione stepped into Theo’s arms, holding her breath as he crouched down and eased her lacy panties down her legs. He paused to press his face into her sex, swiping his tongue over her clit and drawing a prolonged moan from her lips before stepping back with a wicked grin. He gestured towards Draco, and she settled herself down over the top of him. 
 
  Draco reached up to kiss her. Their lips touched briefly once, twice, three times, then Hermione positioned herself more comfortably, and their kisses deepened until Draco was devouring her with the same fervour that Theo had just moments before. Hermione rocked her hips, moving so that Draco’s full length rubbed deliciously through her slippery folds. “Gods, love, you're so wet already,” Draco gasped, lifting his hips to tilt her forwards. 
 
  “Ahhhh…. Oops!” Hermione exclaimed as she inched to one side, and Draco slipped inside her. 
 
  “Oh, Gods,” he moaned, burying himself to the hilt in two swift strokes, “that feels so good.”
 
  “If we were doing a proper scene, I’d spank you both for that,” Theo growled. “I didn’t give you permission to fuck yet.”
 
  Draco’s breath hissed through his teeth in response to Theo’s words. Hermione closed her eyes, whimpering as Draco pulled her down on top of him. “Oh… that feels so good. And sweet fucking Salazar, yes, please Theo. Will you? Please?”
 
  Theo smirked as he shook his head. “Not tonight. I’ve got other things in mind for tonight. But, I’ve noted both of your reactions to my little threat, and I can work a little spanking into our day tomorrow. It is Christmas, after all. Now,” he continued, pressing the flat of his hand against Hermione’s back and chuckling at the long moan Draco gave, “lean forward, love. Angle your hips back, like…. Oh fuck, now I can see 
  
    everything
  
  …. Yeah. Just like that.”
 
  Hermione closed her eyes, melting into Draco’s kiss. The angle he was reaching felt divine, and her brain was already short-circuiting at the thought of adding Theo into the mix as well. 
 
  She gave a breathy moan as Theo’s fingers trailed over her bottom. He explored the point where she and Draco were joined, running the tip of his finger through the wetness there and using his other hand to part her cheeks. He whispered the preparation spell, and her body clenched tightly around Draco in response. “Steady,” Draco gasped. “I’m so close, and don’t want it to be over yet.”
 
  “Sorry.” Hermione made a conscious effort to relax as Theo traced his fingers in circles around her puckered hole. He teased her for a few moments, then gently pressed his thumb inside her. The lube he'd added felt cool and slippery, and Hermione’s whole body shivered with anticipation as she leaned back to offer herself fully to him.
 
  She mewled as he pulled his thumb out, then replaced it with first one finger, and then two. She lifted her hips, whimpering as Theo massaged Draco through her inner wall. The feeling of fullness was already becoming intense. “Just think how good it's going to feel when I'm doing this with my cock,” Theo murmured. Hermione gave a strangled yelp as he carefully pulled his hand back then took a firm hold of her hips instead. “Ready?” he asked. 
 
  “Yes,” Draco gasped, and Hermione’s own breathless agreement came out as an incoherent sigh. She nodded, and Theo edged the head of his cock carefully inside her. 
 
  “Merlin, that’s tight.” Theo breathed as Draco stilled and Hermione made a conscious effort to relax. “More?” he asked, and she nodded again, her eyes wide and her mouth still unable to form words. 
 
  Hermione nuzzled her face into Draco’s neck as Theo pushed forwards. The feeling of fullness became overwhelming as she was stretched in all directions at once, and although it felt highly arousing, it was also like nothing she’d ever felt before. 
 
  “Do you need us to slow down?” Draco whispered. 
 
  “No!" she gasped, "just keep it easy, it’s so good. "
 
  "What about you, Draco?" Theo asked. 
 
  "Don’t you fucking dare stop! It’s just…. oh gods that feels…..” Draco’s words trailed off and he gazed at Hermione, his eyes full of wonder as Theo slid deeper.
 
  “That’s what I said this morning,” Theo whispered, his voice sounding soft and reverent. “I'm all the way in now. How's that feel?”
 
  Hermione closed her eyes, gasping as Theo kissed her shoulder. “Feel so full,” she turned her head as Theo lowered a fraction more of his weight onto her and the added pressure made her feel strangely reassured. “Just give me a moment,” she dropped her head onto Draco’s chest, smiling as she heard his quiet words. “I love you too,” she replied.
 
  “Okay, I’m good,” she whispered. Theo pulled slowly back, and the pressure inside her eased considerably, but she suddenly missed the closeness they had briefly shared.  
 
  “Nghhhhhhhhh,” she moaned as he pushed back in. Now that her body had adjusted to the double intrusion, it was starting to feel sublime. Theo lifted her hips and pulled her slowly backward, giving Draco more room to move.
 
  Draco edged fractionally further down the bed. He placed his hands over Theo’s then thrust gently upwards. “Oh fuck!!” he moaned incredulously.
 
  Hermione closed her eyes and surrendered completely to Theo’s control. Her whole body became one pliant, soft ball of short circuiting nerve endings. Theo steadied her hips as he and Draco fell into an easy rhythm, and suddenly, the three of them settled in together as though it was the most natural thing in the world. She braced herself against the bed, throwing her head back as Draco and Theo both moved easily inside of her.
 
  She angled her hips back to let them move deeper, gasping as Theo pulled out and Draco pushed in. The double sided massage felt incredible. An intense, pulsing pleasure started to build deep inside of her, and she pressed her hands further into the bed to ground herself then pushed back harder, tilting her hips slightly to let Draco thrust deeper. 
 
  “Ngnnnnnn!” She cried as they established a more confident rhythm. “Yes, Oh Gods,  please! I’m so close. You can go deeper, both of you…. I need more….. Mhmmm. Yes. Like that…... Let go for me, please.” 
 
  “How’s this?” Theo’s voice sounded strained as he snapped his hips and plunged inside her.
 “Ahhhhhhh!” Hermione mewled as Draco also upped the power of his thrusts, causing her arousal to increase sharply. “Please…. Oh! I need you to….. I’m so close. Please make me….. Ahhhhh.” 
  Hermione wailed as her walls clenched hard. Draco bucked his hips as Theo withdrew slightly.“Come. Draco. Come for me.” Theo gasped, plunging forward with a deep, guttural moan.
 
  Hermione keened as Theo came. The pressure inside her continued to build as Draco drove powerfully into her once more. It was tight, so overwhelmingly tense, and she suddenly felt as she had that morning, as if she was going to burst. Every move Draco made pummelled her G spot against Theo, and suddenly the pressure became too much for her to bear.
 
  “Nghhhhhh!” She screamed loudly as Draco gave one last, erratic thrust. His abrupt movement bumped Theo, who pressed back against him, and Hermione’s orgasm crashed over her at the same moment Draco’s did. Draco thrust to the hilt inside her, digging his fingers brutally into her hips, and she felt him twitch, finding his release as a sudden gush of her own fluids caused Theo to moan loudly. 
 
  “Ahhhhhhhhh,” Draco finished with one last twitch, then let his head fall back onto the pillow as he fought for breath. His rapidly softening cock eased some of the still intense pressure that Hermione was feeling, and she settled down over his chest, feeling utterly exhausted, her body rising and falling with his strained breaths. 
 
  “My legs won’t hold me up anymore,” Theo complained. He extracted himself carefully from their tangle of limbs, then settled down beside them on the bed. “Hi gorgeous,” he said as Hermione turned to kiss him. “How was that?”
 
  “Hi,” she said, closing her eyes. “I….. That was…. incred….. words….are too much…. right now. Just give me a….. a moment.”
 
  “That was…. utterly….. good,” Draco sighed. “Really, that was…. it was… really very good.”
 
  “I couldn’t agree more.” Theo gave a tired sounding laugh. "Let's have a moment to recover. Then we can celebrate the fact that you just squirted all over me.” Hermione smiled, and blushed, still feeling too wrung out to speak. “Just so you know,” Theo began, “I’ve done some pretty crazy things in my life, but that was, without a doubt, the hottest one of them all.”
 
  “I agree,” Draco admitted. “Now…. just….. give me a moment to recover. I won't fall asleep, I promise.”

  
  
 
  
  

  “How did you see your future panning out then, Hermione?” Draco asked, sleepily joining in with her and Theo’s conversation once he had woken up. He turned onto his side, propped his head on his hand, and stared at Hermione through fully-sated eyes. “Did it, at any point, include the pair of us?”
 
  “No!” She laughed tiredly, sitting back against Theo’s chest. “No. I can honestly say it did not include the pair of you.”
 
  Theo chuckled, and Hermione stilled her glass as the deep rumbles of his laugh caused the water inside it to dance perilously close to the edge. "Okay, next question then, leaving the pair of us out of the equation, did you ever see yourself having more than one partner?”
 
  “Also no,” she admitted, tracing the lines of Theo’s snake tattoo with her finger. She followed it up his arm to the time turner and clock, then paused, frowning at it in confusion. “I always imagined that I’d have a regular one on one relationship. Does this clock show a different time now?” She turned, her curiosity growing as Theo’s breathing gave a telltale hitch.
 
  “Are you….. good grief, Theodore, you’re blushing! I’ve never seen you blush before!” Draco peered at the clock himself. “What's happened?”
 
  “I’m not blushing. I don’t blush,” Theo protested.
 
  “What have you done, and why are you being so evasive about it, then?” Draco asked, fixing Theo with a raised eyebrow.
 
  Theo shook his head then mussed his fingers through his hair in exasperation. “You two notice 
  
    everything!
  
   I’m not being evasive, nor have I done anything dramatic. I might have asked Blaise to change the time on the clock, that's all.”
 
  “So what’s so significant about eight thirty-five?” Hermione asked, smiling at Theo's flustered fidgeting.
 
  Theo screwed his eyes up into a pained grimace. “I can’t tell you that. You’ll think I’ve gone soft.”
 
  “And have you?” Hermione hid a giggle as a further, unmistakable flush of red spread over Theo’s cheeks.
 
  “We already know you’re a lot more soft hearted than you let on,” Draco said, also staring curiously at Theo. “Would it be so bad to share this with us too?”
 
  Theo rolled his eyes. “Merlin, alright, fine! Eight thirty-five is the time you both let me join you in your Cupid pairing, okay?” Hermione’s jaw dropped as Theo laughed. “See? I warned you. Now you know how soft hearted I really am, and my dangerous reputation is shot to pieces!”
 
  Draco chuckled as he leaned forwards to kiss Theo's arm. “Dangerous reputation, my arse. I think that's the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard. Did you tell Blaise the significance of that time?”
 
  Theo nodded, still looking pained. “And Ginny, because she happened to be there too.”
 
  “What did she say?” Draco brushed his lips over the clock's ornate minute hand then traced the snake down Theo’s arm before jumping his finger over to the edge of the newly outlined raven.
 
  “Her reaction was dreadful, Draco.” Theo paused to give a dramatic sigh. “She kissed me on the cheek and called me a darling.” 
 
  Draco threw his head back and laughed. “How very horrifying,” he agreed when he'd finally managed to compose himself.
 
  “It was,” Theo agreed seriously. “I’ll never live it down.” Hermione laughed again. She sipped her water then smiled indulgently at Theo. “So, going back to my original question, if you never saw yourself with two partners, Is this a happy development?” he asked, sounding hesitant as he gestured vaguely between the three of them.
 
  “Yes,” she declared. “The relationship we have is perfect. I’m so glad I’ve found you both. I wouldn’t change this for the world.”
 
  “Good.” Theo kissed the top of her head. “What about you, Blondie? I mean, you and me, we faffed around so much, for so long, didn’t we?”
 
  Draco smiled, catching Theo’s hand and lacing their fingers together. “Yeah. We did. But something was always missing when it was just the pair of us, wasn’t it? I never understood what that was until just recently.” 
 
  Draco paused, frowning at Theo’s bitten fingernails. “ I can't imagine being with any other man, but I love you, Theo, and I find you incredibly attractive. You’re just, you. You understand me, you call me out, you build me up and make me believe in myself.”
 
  “My self esteem was at rock bottom back in October,” Draco continued when Theo just gazed steadily at him. “I almost couldn’t bear to go out in public. I remember not wanting to kiss you in Hogsmeade on our first date, Hermione, because I honestly thought I was bad for you. But you cured me of those worries. You both helped me get back on track, and it was just like all the other times in my life that Theo’s been there for me, except that this time you were both there for me together. So yeah, I never saw myself settling down with a man. But then you started waving that crazy Cupid game in front of me and badgering me until I agreed to play it. I took one look at you that first night in the Room of Requirement, Theo, dressed up in that ridiculous costume, full of exuberance and confidence, and I changed my mind. I changed my mind about a lot of things that night.”
 
  Silence greeted Draco’s words. Theo lifted their still joined hands to his mouth then kissed Draco's fingers, and Hermione closed her eyes, lulled almost to sleep by the gentle rise and fall of Theo’s chest. 
 
  “Have you 
  
    ever 
  
  been faithful in a relationship?” Draco asked suddenly, blinking his impossibly blond lashes up at Theo. 
 
  “Nope,” Theo shook his head. “Not until now, and it wouldn’t even cross my mind to cheat on you two. It's similar to what you've just said, Draco. Something was always missing from my past relationships. If I was seeing a girl, I wanted to be with a boy. If I was seeing a man, I wanted to be with a woman. It was always very confusing, so I never committed to anyone. Except for you, Draco. I’d have committed to you. I like to think I would have, anyway. Do you remember the night we nearly burnt Nott Manor down?”
 
  Frowning, Draco nodded. “That was a long time ago. How old were we?”
 
  “Ten. We were ten years old and we were trying to cast those bluebell flames with my father’s wand. That’s the night I decided I was going to marry you.”
 
  “What?!” Draco spluttered, turning to face Theo, his face incredulous in the firelight. “You decided you were going to marry me when we were ten years old?!”
 
  As Theo nodded, a wide grin spread across his face. “Yep. You looked so flustered as the flames licked up the walls. My father ran into the room, and I instinctively stepped in front of you to protect you. I just wanted to look after you and to shield you from all the evil in the world." He sighed. "The sexual part came later, but that was the start of it all. I even conceded my surname. I thought I’d settle for yours going first. Theodore Malfoy-Nott. It has a good ring to it, I think.”
 
  “It does,” Draco agreed, nodding through his obvious amazement. “Umm, just out of interest, why did you agree to my name going first?” His lips tugged up into a half smirk. “With your pleasure dom kink I’d have thought you’d have held out for me to concede mine.”
 
  Theo laughed. “I’d have liked to, but Theodore Nott-Malfoy sounds plain ridiculous. Can you imagine explaining that to people all the time?”
 
  Draco collapsed forwards onto the bed and laughed. “That's a brilliant answer. So, ten years old and you decided I was the one. Tell me more.”
 
  Theo grinned, dropping Draco’s hand and reaching for the water jug instead. “There's not much more to tell,” he admitted. ”I just wanted you. At first I thought it was because we were such good friends. I wondered if that had just naturally progressed into sexual attraction, but it was always about more than that with you. I proved that by kissing Blaise when he was going through a bi-curious phase.”
 
  Draco blinked in surprise. “You... did? I didn’t know Blaise had a bi-curious phase. Why am I just finding out about all of this now?”
 
  “Because you got all philosophical on me a moment ago, so I felt the need to share a few secrets. Blaise didn’t publicise it. As far as I know, only myself and one other person know it happened. It was back in fifth year, and Blaise was giving me those big brown eyes of his one night. He was quite literally eyefucking me across the dorms at one of Marcus Flint's after quidditch parties. I asked him if he wanted to kiss me. He said yes, so we kissed.”
 
  “And?” Hermione asked, staring at Theo’s defiant look in amusement. 
 
  Theo smiled. “He’s a damn good kisser actually. We got down to it, and it was good. Really good. His hands strayed into my hair. He was testing me as much as I was testing him. He knew all about my sexuality, as most people did. I never tried to hide anything, did I?” Theo looked up as Draco shook his head. “I fancied the pants off of Blaise. I mean, who wouldn’t? The man’s stunning, so I thought it was the perfect time to test my “I only like Draco because he’s a good friend theory.”
 
  Theo paused. “Merlin, this got deep rather quickly, didn’t it?” he looked ruefully at his glass of water, apparently wishing it was something stronger, then carried on. “Anyway, Blaise didn’t object when my hands crept under his shirt. In fact he pulled me closer and even returned the favour, but I was as hard as a rock and my cock bumped against his thigh and that seemed to be a step too far for him. He kind of paused, then pulled back. I lifted a brow. He considered me for a moment, then shook his head and said he’d satisfied his curiosity, and that he was going to stick to girls from now on.”
 
  “Goodness! What did you say to that?” Draco asked, sounding amazed.
 
  Theo shrugged. “There wasn’t much I could say, was there? I told him it was fine, went to the showers, and got half way through a bloody good wank before Casius Warrington burst in. Well, Zabini might not have been queer, but it turned out that Cas was. He’d seen me and Blaise kiss, seen B walk away, then he’d followed me into the bathroom hoping to pick up where Blaise left off. The only reason this matters, through Draco, is because it proved my point. I walked away from Blaise quite happily, I couldn’t have walked away from you like that. I was holding out for you because I was in love with you. But you were as slippery as a fucking eel. You wouldn’t commit to anything, and so I bided my time until you came to your senses. Then the game happened, and well, I got two partners for the price of one.”
 
  “Came to my senses?” Draco spluttered, laughing incredulously as he shook his head. 
 
  “Two for the price of one?” Hermione licked her lips, arching her own eyebrows the way Draco often did. "You can be a little too cheeky sometimes, Theodore."
 
  Theo grinned. “Yep. Guilty as charged. But with regard to being faithful in relationships, I’m a changed man. I intend to be faithful to both of you forever.”
 
  “Good.” Draco gave him a satisfied smile. “What are we going to do about our surnames now, though?”
 
  “Meaning?” Hermione yawned widely. She drained the last of her water then settled back against Theo with her eyes closed. 
 
  “Well,” Draco trailed gentle fingers over her stomach, “I’m guessing you won’t take ours and drop yours?”
 
  Hermione smiled. “Not a chance. Especially if you're both keeping yours. I’ll go with Hermione Granger-Malfoy-Nott.”
 
  “Hermione Malfoy-Granger-Nott,” Draco countered. “Whatever combination of Malfoy and Granger we use, Nott’s got to go last or we hit the same snag.”
 
  “I’ll accept that,” Theo smiled.
 
  “I like Malfoy-Granger-Nott,” Hermione said softly. “I like my name being between yours.”
 
  “I always said you’d enjoy being sandwiched between the pair of us,” Theo said. “Do you remember? I said that at about eight thirty-seven that first night, in fact.”
 
  Hermione smiled. “I remember,” she yawned again as Draco took the empty glass from her hand. “Shall we settle down? I mean, It's past midnight, and Percy’s working out our Hogwarts plans tomorrow. We’d better be awake for that.”
 
  Draco nodded, sliding down the bed and holding the duvet up until Hermione settled into her favourite position, spooned against his chest with her legs tangled through Theo’s. She closed her eyes, smiling happily as she started to drift off to sleep. So much in her life had changed in such a short time, but snuggled here, in bed with Draco and with a very restless Theo beside her, she knew she had found the place she truly belonged.
 
  Theo fidgeted much more than he usually did, tossing and turning until Draco lost patience and threw a spare pillow over his head. “If you want to go back downstairs, then go. We don't mind. The party’s still in full swing, after all,” he said.
 
  Theo sighed, returning the pillow to a safer place. “I was going to, but no. I’m actually where I want to be right now. I’m settling down here with you two.”
 
  “Wow!” Draco said through a barely stifled yawn. “That’s surprising. Lay still then, before I put you into a full body-bind. 
 
  Theo laughed. “I’d like to see you try, Malfoy,” he muttered, turning onto his side, hooking his ankle through Hermione’s, and finally laying still. 
 
  Hermione smiled again as her eyes closed. Everything was right with the world now. Draco's arm tightened around her as Theo changed position yet again then abruptly stilled and began to snore. She snuggled tightly into Draco, feeling overwhelmed with love. She was home. She was where she belonged, and as unexpected as this whole relationship was, she knew she wouldn’t change anything about it for the world.
