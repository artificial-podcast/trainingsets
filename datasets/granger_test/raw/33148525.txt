  “Ginny, are you sure this is safe?” 


  Hermione asked her friend as they sat down in their booth. She shucked off her coat and placed it under her bum. Ginny gave her pointed look and sighed, removing her own jacket to show off the silky royal blue dress she wore. This had been the fifth time Ginny had to explain to her friend that this was, in fact, safe. 


  “Hermione yes. Everyone who does the service has to pass a rigorous test of requirements. Background checks, establish their place of work plus they need two valid referrals remember? This is safe and I’m excited so can you please just relax?” 


  The witch sighed. “You’re right I’m sorry. I am excited, a little nervous, but this will be fun.” 


  Ginny had signed up for a dating service offered to young witches and wizards in Britain. After a heart wrenching break up with Harry a few years ago, she decided to stop feeling bad for herself and bravely put herself out there. This would be the first blind date she went on through the service, but her representative told her based on both their profiles, it could be a high rated match. 


  Hermione obviously had her doubts and worries. Blind dates seemed so juvenile and scary. What if the man was a killer? What if the man was ugly? What if the man was an idiot? 


  Even after the multiple reassurances that it was fine and she had no reason to worry, Ginny finally told Hermione she could tag along for safety reasons. Her mystery date was even bringing a friend as his own safety net. 


  “Okay. I was told he’d be in a blue shirt and he’ll be arriving in ten minutes. Drink of choice: firewhiskey.” Ginny said, scooting all over her seat and watching the faces of the patrons coming into the club known as the Cherry Pit. It was a newer pub, opened just under two years ago, and attracted a younger crowd, but Hermione had never been. It seemed to draw people who were more interested in snogging and insane dancing rather than sitting for an actual drink.


  Hermione looked at her friend and smiled. She was truly happy for her excitement and even a tad jealous. It had been awhile since she had a date, and even longer since she’s had sex. She noticed as soon as she got a promotion in the Ministry, men stopped approaching her. It wasn’t bothersome until Ginny innocently pointed out how long ago it was since she had a date and then her stomach had sunk into the floor at the realization. 


  Dating hadn’t been the main focus in Hermione’s life nor something she thought about, but with all of her friends in a relationship and now Ginny taking it upon herself to not be single anymore, she felt alone. There just wasn’t anyone looking it seemed, or maybe, no one looking for her. 


  “I need a drink.” Hermione mumbled and quickly scooted herself out of the booth. 


  “Can you get me something strong?” Ginny requested, handing her a few galleons. 


  Hermione took them from her and winked. “You got it.” 


  The place was rather crowded and it took Hermione a moment as she pushed her way past a large crowd of dancing individuals before finally making it to the bar. The pub maid was more than busy and was rushing over to Hermione, she had to yell her order over the music to be heard. While the place seemed to be a lively environment, she’d rather be sitting at home with a glass of wine, or even a quieter pub for a butterbeer.


  Placing her arms on the bar, she listened to the songs and watched the workers frantically try to fill all their drink orders in a timely manner. She’d turn her head every so often to see the new faces in the dim light and through the cigarette smoke. Maybe she’d enjoy the atmosphere more if the pub was non-smoke friendly and more of a bar and less of a club, but Ginny’s date picked the location to her dismay, so she supposed she’d have to suck it up for the night. 


  “Two firewhiskeys please.” A deep voice came beside her and she peeked over her shoulder. 


  Her eyebrow quirked up when she saw Blaise Zabini standing less than an inch away from her. He was so close she could faintly smell his cologne. She eyed him up and down slowly and when she brought her eyes back up to his face, his own dark gaze waiting for her with a charming smirk. She blushed instantly. 


  “Granger.” He uttered in a low voice. 


  “Zabini.” She responded, her breathing slightly uneven since she just was caught checking out a former classmate. 


  “Surprised to see you here. Didn’t think the Cherry Pit was your type of place.” He noted, turning his body towards her so one arm was propped against the bar and the other was lazily in his pant pocket. 


  Hermione had to look away from his flirty stare as, thankfully, her drinks arrived. 


  “It’s not. I’m actually here with…” Hermione began but her eyes caught Blaise’s arm, or she should really say his shirt. He was wearing a deep blue, turtleneck with dark gray pants. Her mouth hung open and words pooled out before she could stop them. 


  “Why are you here Zabini?” She asked, her forwardness made Blaise let out a chuckle. He stood to his full height and she had to take a half step back to look at him. 


  “I’m here to meet someone actually.” He admitted and his two firewhiskeys came. He took one and sipped it, looking over the glass, giving her a questioning look. “But something tells me you already knew that.” 


  Hermione crossed her arms and let her head tilt back as she laughed out loud. Blaise raised his eyebrows. “You’re here on a blind date, from that service, aren’t you?” 


  Blaise smiled. “Don’t laugh, Granger. I’m trying something new and I wanted an opportunity to be free of judgement.” 


  “Judgement of what?” She curiously asked. Blaise was known as an admirable man. He worked as a sports columnist and had even done some articles on Ginny since she played on the Harpies. There was nothing Hermione couldn’t immediately think of anything that was problematic, until she remembered a small rumor she heard from Katie that he was a bit of a promiscuous wizard and enjoyed one night dates instead of relationships. 


  “Some women refer to me as a manwhore.” He said, an actual look of disappointment on his face but Hermione couldn’t help but laugh again. 


  “Yeah, I’ve heard that too.” She giggled and sipped on the fruity cocktail. She coughed when she remembered she ordered a double for her and Ginny, for both their nerves. 


  Blaise laughed this time watching as his former uptight school mate choke on her alcohol. 


  “So,” he began, “since you knew about the blind date, would you care to escort me to Ginny?” 


  Hermione gave him a funny look. “How did you know it was Ginny?” 


  “Please Granger. You two are notoriously single. You personally would never come here, you’re too uptight for a place like this, but this is Ginny’s crowd and since you’re not wearing blue, I can only assume that she is?” 


  Hermione found herself offended at his statement. “I am not uptight.” She stated and took another sip of her awful drink but Blaise interjected. 


  “I don’t mean it as a bad thing Granger. You’re more wine after work, not dirty dance floors and blind dates.” He smiled, taking a jab at himself and Hermione felt her chest lighten just a tad. 


  “Ginny is in the booth over there.” She pointed to the area in the corner and Blaise looked over the crowd of people, seeing some red hair under the flashing color changing lights. “Here,” she gave him Ginny’s drink, “tell her I’m going to finish my drink and head home. I’m no longer worried her blind date isn’t a suitable match.” 


  “You should stay and join. I don’t mind and I’m certain she won’t.” She found his niceness very appreciated but she knew better. 


  “No no. This isn’t my scene, remember?” She joked. 


  “You never know. This place may surprise you.” He responded, an interesting look on his face but she couldn’t quite read what it meant.


  “Maybe. But you should surprise Ginny first.” She offered politely. 


  Blaise smirked and leaned down to her ear. “Don’t tell her this, but I always had a thing for Weasley.” He pulled back and shot her a wink, both their drinks in his hand as he turned away from her. 


  Hermione felt genuinely relieved. Though Blaise wasn’t her first choice for Gin, she could see why the dating service paired them together. He was charming and confident, she just hoped he truly was in this for a relationship and not a quick shag for the sake of Ginny’s feelings. 


  She turned back around and drank at the bar, wincing every time she swallowed the strong liquid, with Blaise's words ringing through her mind. It’s not the first time someone has referred to her as uptight. Hell, even Ginny would call her uptight anytime Hermione tried to stop her from talking about sex. 


  It didn’t hurt her feelings usually, but hearing it from a man, or rather an attractive man who barely knew her, had stung. Maybe that’s why no one had asked her out in a long time. She always thought it was due to her stellar reputation of turning men down, but she began to doubt it more and more every day. 


  Her stomach bubbled uncomfortably and she wrinkled her nose as someone beside her lit up a cigarette. She turned to glare at the person beside her and was ready to move away until she saw who it was. Cigarette in hand, the abandoned other firewhiskey Blaise had ordered in the other, was Draco Malfoy. 


  Stood in a pair of black jeans and a white oxford with the first buttons popped open, Malfoy leaned his upper body on the bar. His sleeves rolled up to his elbows, exposing heavily inked tattooed skin. Everything except his hands were marked with blank and gray ink. His forearm had intricate flowers and vines, weaving into the dark mark like it was all one masterpiece. His other arm had latin words written like calligraphy and swirls of something she couldn’t make out. She couldn’t tear her eyes away from him.


   It had been at least a year since she last saw him in public. The last time was at Flourish and Botts. He was leaving and she was coming in at the exact moment. They looked at each other astonished but Malfoy quickly regained composure first. He stepped down, his height towering over Hermione. She immediately took a set back and Draco kept his gray eyes on her the whole time, taking in her every move. He stepped to the side and held the door open for her. 


  
    “After you Granger.” He said, his voice ricocheting through her chest. She licked her lips once and averted her face from his penetrating gaze. Mumbling a quiet ‘thanks’ she entered the book store.
  


  She hadn’t seen him since that little encounter, not that many people see Malfoy out and about as is. He remained extremely private after the war, only making public appearances at foundation balls or quidditch games. She didn’t even know if he worked, no one did, not that he had to anyways. 


  Staring at him with her mouth slightly ajar, she was fascinated by how at ease he looked in this crowded and loud club. He casually sipped on his whiskey and dragged a long inhale from his cigarette, not a care in the world or a worried thought in his pretty pale head.


  “Keep staring and you’re going to catch lacewing flies in your mouth Granger.” He turned his head to speak, but didn’t look at her. His gaze remained on the amber liquid he swirled in his glass. 


  Hermione snapped her head forward and felt herself blush. She took a long sip of her drink to hide her embarrassment and hoped the buzz that began to take her head would help her find her words. Halfway done with her drink and already feeling buzzed? She shouldn’t have ordered a double. 


  Malfoy reached over the bar and threw two cherries into his mouth, leisurely chewing on them. She couldn’t help herself. She eyed the flex of his sharp jaw through the corner of her eye. The movement looked so slow and languid, it was mesmerizing. 


  “I don’t think you can do that.” The words slipped through her mouth before she had a second thought. It was stupid to say, something that made Draco crinkle his forehead but a slow smirk still spread on his moist lips. 


  “Who says?” He replied, reaching over and taking another cherry. He turned his head so his chin rested on his shoulder and he could keep eye contact with her while he ate the sweet berry. His hands rested on the opposite biceps, cigarette fitted between slender fingers, he looked so relaxed. It was attractive, 
  
    he 
  
  was attractive.


  Hermione shrugged her shoulders, the warm alcohol heating her up. She felt her body loosen and almost laughed. 


  “I don’t know. Basic societal norms? The owner of the bar?” She suggested, swirling her straw around her drink. 


  Draco licked his lips, a sickening smile present. “I don’t think he’ll mind.” 


  Hermione looked back to him, his gray eyes seemingly translucent under the changing lights. She thought he looked like a panther with his eyes glowing in the dark, a predator waiting for its next meal. 


  “Why’s that?” Hermione found her voice but it sounded much raspier than she wanted. 


  “What are you doing here tonight?” 


  Draco ignored her and rose to his full height. He had gained inches since Hogwarts. She remembered him being tall at Flourish and Botts, but she assumed it was because he was standing one cement step above her. Now she could see her forehead barely reached the middle of his chest. Seems the Slytherin boys were drinking special height growing water. 


  “Ginny had a blind date who ended up being Blaise Zabini. I came for support.” She told him, taking another hesitant sip of her drink. 


  Draco finished his cigarette and crushed it in the marble tray on the bar top. “So did I.” 


  “You were the friend he brought along?” Hermione asked and Draco nodded while topping off his whiskey and motioning for the barmaid for two shots. She quickly scurried to fill the request faster than the other orders. Hermione thought it was odd but also realized Draco was extremely attractive, and many girls were probably willing to do anything for him at the drop of a hat. Even the barmaids who had plenty of other people they needed to worry about.


  “And you were the friend she brought along.” He stated rather than asked and she nodded the same. Draco let out an entertained huff. “Figures as much.” 


  “What does that mean?” She crossed her arms over her chest, the same sense of offensiveness she felt when Blaise called her uptight coming back. 


  Draco wet his lips once more and gave her a once over look. If she wasn’t offended at that moment she would have shivered under his gaze. “I don’t think you’d come to a club like this on your own volition.” He told her honestly. 


  Hermione stared at him. Her cheeks and chest flush and her mind racing. “You think I’m uptight too.” 


  He merely gave her a casual shrug. “You said it, not me.” 


  “I don’t believe this. I’m not uptight, why does everyone keep saying that?” She shrieked, taking a large gulp off her drink, finally finishing it. 


  “Maybe because you are?” He suggested while leaning one hand against the top of the bar. Though his tone was teasing she still felt her chest pang with disappointment. 


  “I’m not.” Hermione pouted. 


  “You sure?” He asked, clearly finding joy in Hermione Granger being under the influence and pouting. 


  “Just because I work a lot and don’t go out all the time like other people doesn’t mean I’m uptight.” She rambled, running a hand through her growing curls. The humidity and smoke did nothing to help keep her hair tamed and her growing frustration only made it worse. She annoyingly tied it back in a pony and Draco watched her movements with his head bobbed to the side. 


  “You’re not uptight huh?” He challenged. 


  “I’m not.” She told him stuffy and he laughed. 


  “Granger, you're at a club wearing jeans and a sweater.” 


  She looked down self consciously and noticed most of the other witches were either in revealing dresses or skirts. She didn’t care about her outfit, she didn’t come to meet anyone. Why did it matter? 


  “And? I wasn’t planning on staying long after I made sure Ginny was alright. I don’t see why it matters.” She explained softly. 


  Draco squinted at her. “Then stay a little longer.” 


  “What?” She asked incredulously. 


  Draco took a step toward her, thinking maybe she couldn’t hear him over the music. He moved his neck lower, his mouth only a few inches from her mouth. Hermione sucked in a breath and held it. She stared at his shoulder and could smell the heavy woodsy scents of his cologne. It mixed with the faint smell of smoke and she unwillingly admitted to herself he sort of smelt good. 


  “Stay. Have fun. Unwind. Prove you’re not so uptight.” His voice sounded like velvet and with the alcohol coursing through her blood, she felt easily persuaded. 


  He stood up straight and reached for the two filled shot glasses. They glowed with a purple liquid and she saw the color reflect in Draco’s eyes. He raised the shot glass up to her and Hermione slowly took it into her hand, trying her best to not to spill. 


  Draco grinned with one half of his mouth. Her caramel eyes looked enticing and he briefly thought the flush on her cheeks complimented the pink color of her lips. 


  “To…” She started and he finished. 


  “Unwinding.” He clinked his glass to hers and they held eye contact while bringing their shot to their lips. Hermione was the first to look away. She shut her eyes and swallowed the liquid. It tasted like grapes and she was thankful it wasn’t as strong as her ordered drink. 


  He took her glass out of her hands once she finished. His fingers felt cold despite the heat in the club and the contact made her gasp. His pale face turned back to her and he held her eye contact for a long moment. He was close. She could still smell his scent and see moisture on his lips from the alcohol. 


  Draco wondered if he’d ever get this opportunity again. Here he was, taking shots with Granger on a Friday night. She was obliging him, she looked comfortable and loose. He saw an open door and was about to walk through it. 


  “Granger?” He asked, his tone light. 


  Hermione blinked slowly at him and felt her heart hammer when she stared into his eyes. 


  “Yes?”


  “Come with me.” He told her and reached down to lace their fingers together. 


  Before she could ask any questions or give protests, he pulled her away from the bar and into the growing crowd. She kept her focus on his arm, looking at the swirling black ink and saw it was a cluster of stars forming constellations as he led them away from the bar. 


  Hermione didn’t know if it was the alcohol, his cooling skin against her palm, the alluring art on his body or the fact that his smile looked like sin, but she followed him without concern.

  Draco took them upstairs where more booths and tables were set up to watch the crowd of young witches and wizards dancing below. It was less crowded but there were still people cuddled into booths, heavily groping and snogging each other as if they weren’t out in public. 


  Hermione averted her stare, looking down to where her and Malfoy’s hands connected. He looked back at her every so often only to smirk when he noticed her looking down at his hand or his tattoos. He enjoyed that she was so intrigued by him and had hoped her curiosity would propel her confidence. 


  Approaching a black velvet couch that looked like a semi circle, Draco removed his hand from hers and placed it on the small of her back to usher her forward. She wordlessly sat down and he followed, leaning back and placing both arms over the back of the couch. He spread his legs wide and Hermione thought this was the most relaxed she’s ever seen him. He was acting like he owned the bloody place. 


  Hermione was thankful for her heavy buzz. She didn’t think she’d be so calm without that extra shot in her system. Sitting here with Malfoy made her feel nervous and almost…giddy. It was different feeling and she was determined to prove all the people, especially Draco, that she wasn’t uptight. 


  She openly stared at his legs and wondered when his thighs became so muscular. They looked double the size of hers and were straining in the denim he wore. In fact, his whole body was bulging with muscles, when did that happen? 


  “Still up to unwind?” He asked, talking normally now that the music wasn’t so loud. His gray eyes glinted with something mischievous. 


  Hermione felt her stomach twist but she still nodded and bit the corner of lip while clenching and unclenching her fists in her lap. Draco lifted his hips in the air and reached into his back pocket. Hermione saw his long fingers hold up a rolled blunt. He lifted it up once with a skeptical yet bemused expression. 


  “Ever smoke before?” He questioned. 


  She felt herself slowly shake her head, eyeing the herb. “No. I’m not a fan of smoking. In any sense.” She said, feeling awkward to blatantly tell him she disliked a habit he clearly partook in. It felt rude and out of place.


  Draco squinted his eyes at her but still let out a small laugh. “I’ll remember that next time. But I think you’ll like this.” 


  She looked at his face, he was waiting patiently for her okay. He didn’t appear to be mocking of her lack of experience or have a condescending look on his face and she was thankful. She found herself scooting a little closer to him. 


  “Why would I like it?” She cautiously asked while Draco put the brown piece of paper between his lips and brought his wand up to light it. 


  She watched as a thicker smoke formed from the end of it as he took a long inhale. He looked at it then back to Hermione, his gray eyes void of any emotion. The smell hit her nostrils and she thought it was unpleasant, but more bearable than cigarette smoke. Draco blew the smoke away from them, a thin cloud now looming over their heads. 


  “Because this specific type will help you relax. It’s good for nerves or, you know, help you not be uptight.” He smirked and offered her the rolled herb. 


  She hesitantly took it and tried to imitate the way Draco held it. Studying the way it burned, she felt a little embarrassed that she had to ask her next question. 


  “So…what do I do?” She looked up to him quickly then back down to the joint. 


  Instead of a laugh or a snide comment, Draco moved closer to her, taking her wrist gently in his hand and pushing the blunt up to her lips. 


  “Just take a long inhale and hold it in your chest. The longer you hold it the better.” 


  Bringing it to her lips, she did as he instructed and tried to take the biggest inhale she could muster while not choking on the vapor. She held it for a few seconds before her chest started tightening and she had to let go. Immediately coughing into her shoulder, she handed it back to him. 


  “I’ll get water.” He told her, standing up from the couch and heading over to the smaller bar in the back corner. 


  Hermione was still trying to control her coughs by the time he got back. She gratefully accepted the glass and took a long sip, the cold water soothing the burn in her throat. 


  Draco took another two pulls and rested back on the couch. He sat closer than he did previously, his thigh touched her own and she almost coiled back but she felt her body easing into the feeling. Draco looked at Hermione and raised the blunt back to her, silently asking if she wanted another hit. 


  Reaching for the rolled drug, she brought it back up to her lips. The tip was damp from where Draco had it in his mouth and it made her shift in her place. 


  “Try taking smaller inhales at a time. So you can get a feel of when it’s too much.” He explained. 


  She heeded the advice and found it much easier to handle than before. Holding it in her chest until she felt the burn, she only coughed a little bit after and Draco smiled. 


  “See? Not so bad.” He told her and Hermione leaned her body back against the comfortable couch, matching his posture. She rubbed her hands up and down her thighs, enjoying the feeling of the texture on her fingers, it was soothing.


  She felt her mind slow down and it was like she could hear her thoughts aloud in her head. The alcohol made her buzzed but now she was feeling dizzy and calm. Her body felt weightless, it was strange and foreign and she was adjusting to the new sensations. Her skin tingled as if someone had electrocuted her in a most pleasing way. 


  Momentarily shutting her eyes, she became lost in her thoughts, feeling good and happy. A slow smile spread over her lips and she soon was proud of herself for agreeing to come up here with Malfoy. People were wrong about her and she wished someone could see her now having fun. It was easy, why hadn’t she done this before?


  Draco sat beside her and rested his head on the ledge of the couch. He flicked the ash of the blunt off to the side and turned his attention back to Hermione, ready to offer her another hit. But he saw her eyes closed and a ghost of a smile of absolute pleasure on her face, so he stared. 


  He watched her chest rise and fall slowly, and saw her tongue poke out to wet her lips. He thought she looked peaceful and realized she must have been feeling the effects of the drug. Selfishly taking one last elongated moment to take in what seemed like a private moment, he eventually nudged her hand with the back of his and offered her the blunt one more time. 


  “One more? I don’t think you need any after. This is pretty strong.” She agreed and took it from him. He moved his arm closest to her and threw it behind her head, the other hand rested on the inside of his thigh. 


  Draco watched as her cheeks sucked in when she inhaled. Her eyelashes were fluttering against her cheek and when she blew the smoke out of her lungs, her lips formed a tight o shape. 


  When she handed the blunt back, he didn’t immediately take it. He waited until she looked at him, then finally plucked it from her fingers. He grinned down at her, seeing the mellow look on her face. “Feel it?”


  She nodded slowly in response, another smile coming on her face. 


  Draco took one more hit before setting the blunt down on the ashtray. He kicked his right leg up onto the matching center foot rest, but kept his left leg on the ground, not wanting to feel the loss of heat between his and Hermione’s thigh. 


  Hermione was still lightly rubbing her palms up her thighs. She felt entranced by how the fabric felt against her skin. Her movements were slow and she had no idea Draco was watching the motion with the upper most interest. He watched as she’d bring her palm to the top of her hips back down to her knees and briefly thought to himself what it would feel like to have her tiny hands on his thighs like that. 


  A song rang through the club with heavy bass and a slower melody, she felt her heart beat slow to match the pace of the drums and guitar. 


  “I like this song.” She grinned and drummed her fingers along to the tune. 


  Hermione was alive, this was the best music had ever sounded to her. She could feel every note strike together to create the perfect sound and it was orchestrated specifically to fit her mood. The sound bounced through her chest and reverberated through her skin. This feeling put her on cloud nine.


  Draco was swaying his leg on the ground, his thigh occasionally bumping into Hermione’s. His body unraveled and he truly didn’t have a care in that moment. The main focus at the forefront of his mind was the fact that Hermione was seemingly moving her thigh with his, so the contact wouldn’t be lost. 


  He looked over at her, her eyes focused on the movements of their legs. She sensed he was staring so she met his eyes, grinning like there was some secret joke between them.


  “What?” She asked, a small giggle rising. 


  Draco shook his head once, his intense gaze never moving from her entertained face. 


  “You look all serious.” She told him, giggling more and Draco felt the corner of his lips quirk up. “What is that look? You look like a statue.” 


  Draco watched as she laughed, her eyes squinting tight and her cheeks stretched wide. He found himself enjoying how much she was having fun. An idea came to his mind and he found himself grinning back at her, but it held something darker, more intentional. 


  “Do you want to try something?” Draco questioned, bending his neck closer to her ear so she could hear him over her fit of giggles. 


  Hermione calmed down instantly when she felt his warm breath fan over her neck. Still wearing a grin, she bit her lip and noticed his pupils looked larger. His platinum blonde hair was longer now, the fray of it coming down over his eyebrows. She wanted to reach up and push it back, away from his eyes but she refrained. Instead she eagerly nodded, up for anything at this point. 


  Draco picked the blunt back up and moved to sit facing her. His knee was hitting the side of her bum and his shin was attached to her thigh. Hermione couldn’t tell if it was her body that was so warm or his. 


  He relit the blunt, eyes flickered up to hers and she felt hypnotized by the way the flames danced in his eyes. She focused on his rose colored lips, enclosing over the tip. He took a deep inhale, keeping his eyes on her. 


  With the smoke still in his mouth, he set the blunt down. He moved his upper bottom to lean slightly into her personal space. She didn’t move back, she couldn’t. Hermione felt giddy that he was so close. 


  “Open up.” 


  He leaned his head down, the proximity made her gasp. Draco hovered his lips an inch away from hers and blew the smoke into her mouth. Her eyes fell shut and she inhaled his second hand smoke, it tasted better than straight from the blunt. Smelling a man’s breath was not something she ever considered to be enticing, but she would have loved if he breathed on her all night. 


  She blew the smoke back out once he barely pulled his face away. His eyes danced all over her face and Hermione wanted to know what he was thinking about. The heavy glance he casted was more than enough to make her heart speed up. She gave him a soft, timid smile, he returned it. 


  “Do you like to dance?” He spoke, his voice seemed lower than before. Her stomach rolled at the sound. 


  “No. I’m not good at it.” She confessed and Draco gave her a funny look. Blinking a few times to collect a coherent thought, Hermione didn’t even realize she spoke out loud. She was thinking in her head and aware her lips moved. 


  “Why do you say that?” 


  Her eyes fell trailed down his smooth neck and into the exposed skin on his chest. His collarbone jutted out from under the see through fabric of his shirt, she licked her lips. 


  “I—I don’t know how.” She said, bringing her eyes back up to meet his, a quirked brow awaited her. 


  “Hmm.” He hummed, trying to conceal his smirk. “We can always learn.” 


  Hermione shook her head and backed away. She would have felt nervous or worried, but instead, her body told her this whole situation was funny. Here he was attempting to seduce her to learn to dance. She knew what type of dance he meant too. The slow, sweaty, grinding of the hips to the rhythm of the beat that made her look away when her and Ginny first arrived. 


  “I don’t think so.” She told him, giggling into the back of her hand. 


  “Come on, it’ll be fun. If you’re not a…hands on learner, then we can still watch.” 


  Hermione saw the way his eyes looked over her when he said, ‘hands on,’ and it made her center tighten up. Draco offered her his hand, palm up and gave her a look as if to say 
  
    I dare you to resist.
  
   She couldn’t. Her reserves went to the wind when she accepted his hand downstairs, now was no different. 


  Peering into his eyes, she tentatively took his hand, gaining a sinful smile from him in return. He picked up the blunt and stood up, she slowly followed. His hands felt even cooler than before, it soothed her fire licked skin. She admired the contrast but found herself somewhat concerned, was he anemic?


  Draco laughed beside her as he backed up out of the little alcove they were in. “No I’m not whatever you just said. I just run cool.” 


  Hermione’s eyes widened. “Did I say that out loud?”


  Draco nodded, laughing again “Yeah, you’re definitely high.” 


   She couldn’t help but join him. He had a laugh that was deep and rattling. It sounded so pure and intimate, like he only laughed like that when no one was looking. His lips stretched wide and his eyes shut with crinkles around them. The angle of his jaw bounced and she felt the urge to run her face along it. 


  While they both settled down and controlled their breathing, Draco had led them over to the balcony that overlooked the dance floor below. He stood beside her, leaning his arms against the railing so his forearms were leisurely hanging over it. Even leaning down, he was inches taller than her. She felt like a bloody elf compared to him. 


  Resting her hands delicately on the metal of the railing, she watched the bodies of people on the dance floor move to the music. Witches were shamelessly touching their wizards and she watched some men grope their bums, their hips and sometimes even their breasts. They were in public for Merlin’s sake, but no one cared.


  She admired the way the other witches looked confident in their movements, and she wished she could move flawlessly and sway her hips the way that got men’s attention. Seeing people grab at each other like that made her envious, especially when it had been so long since the ache between her legs had been satiated by something other than her own fingers. 


  Draco watched Hermione view the crowd and noticed her breathing picking up. Her eyes were low and she began to softly chew on her lip. Her curly hair pulled back exposed the soft skin of her neck, and he was eager to see if it was as soft as it looked. 


  He lit the blunt for the final time and took a long drag. Rolling his neck until he heard a few bones cracked, he almost moaned at the feeling. Throwing the blunt on the ground and stomping on the small ashes, he looked back to her, seeing her face hold an expression of…longing. 


  He leaned into her, their shoulders touching and his mouth right by her ear. Draco stayed the perfect amount of distance away, just enough for her to feel his warm breath tickle her sin, but far enough away where if she moved her head to look at him, only their noses would bump. 


  “Do you like the way they dance?” 


  Hermione gasped, too afraid to look at him so she kept her eyes at the people below her. She nodded once. 


  “Do you like how free they look? How little they care that there’s other people in the room?” 


  His voice made her shiver and she moved her head back just the tiniest bit, Draco noticed. Her eyes were focused on one couple towards the middle. A witch had her head tilted back on the wizard’s chest, while her hips sensually moved against his front. The wizard’s hands were all over her stomach and legs, his mouth attached to the base of her neck as they danced. 


  “Do you wish that were you?” Draco whispered hotly into her ear. She could no longer hear the music no matter how loud it was, she only heard his voice. It seemed the people were dancing along to his words, grinding against each other to match the tune of his voice. 


  “It can be you, you know.” Draco pushed himself off the balcony and stepped behind her. She was frozen in her spot as he continued to speak to her. “You can dance like that, be…touched like that.” 


  His voice was behind her now, tattooed arms on either side of her, circling her tiny frame. She couldn’t feel him anywhere, only hear him. Her eyes were lulling close at the sound. 


  “Is that something you want, Granger?” 


  The sound of her name sounded raspy in his throat, she wanted to hear it again. Her eyes fell shut and her head rolled back. Lightly falling against his chest, her hair directly fell on the skin open from his shirt. Draco liked the feeling of her curls tickling his skin, they felt silky smooth despite looking untame. 


  “Tell me that’s what you want. Say it.” He gently commanded. The soothing tone coaxed a response she wasn’t sure she would have said if sober. 


  “Yes.” 


  Before she even finished hissing the s of her yes, Draco’s hands were greedily on her. One hand pressed flat against her stomach, the other gripping her the bone on her hip. Their bodies were flushed together but she didn’t dare touch him back. She was afraid if she did, she’d wake up and realize what she was doing and with whom. 


  “Pick a sound and move with it, do what feels natural.” His lips were still hovering at her ear, never crossing the line to touch her actual skin. 


  Hermione still tightly held onto the railing, scared she’d fall back into his arms if she didn’t support herself. She took his advice and listened for a beat she liked. Her hips began to slowly move, left to right and in small circles, just like the witches below her. All the while, Draco’s hands touched over her stomach and sides, his cold fingertips would sometimes dip under her sweater and she’d sigh, leaning more of her body on his. 


  “Just like that. See? A natural.” Draco praised and she felt herself smiling at his encouragement. 


  Hermione felt Draco move with her motions, guiding her hips against his as he pushed his hips forward every so often. There was a throb in her lower region every time he moved or stroked her body.  People on this floor most likely watching the unlikely pair and people below who could clearly see them, but she didn’t care. All she was concerned about was getting as close as possible to him. 


  “Do you like being touched like this.” Hermione almost moaned at his words. No one had ever spoken to her so bluntly while touching her like such. His right hand was under her sweater, grazing her stomach with lazy touches. His other hand was still roaming up and down her sides down to the top of her thighs. The erotic movements of their bodies plus his heavy hands on her skin made her eyes roll into her head. 


  “Yes.” She pushed her bum back into his hips and slowly lowered her body down his before bringing it back up. She felt a fire within that she hadn’t felt with other men or with boyfriends. Hermione felt loose and wanted and sexy, and Draco Malfoy was making her feel all of it. 


  “Do you like my skin on yours?” He asked, bushing his cheek onto her face. His question sounded more breathless, like he was panting. 


  “Yes.” She heard him growl into her ear at her confession, his hands tightened their hold on her. Still having her eyes closed, she slowly reopened them and looked down at his arms. The black ink contrasted the pale skin of his hands. She watched his forearm flex in wonder when he squeezed her thigh. 


  “Do you want more?” His voice sounded unlike him. He was no longer curious and amused. He was full of want and desire. He groaned when she let go of the bar and brought one tiny hand over the one under her shirt and the other reached behind her to find the silky blonde hair at his neck. 


  “Please.” 


  She whispered and not even needing a second more, Draco’s lips placed a kiss right under her ear. The feeling made Hermione’s skin shiver and she sighed heavily. He continued planting kisses over her neck until she pulled on his hair and he in turn, bit her neck. 


  Hermione moaned out loud and the sound echoed through Draco’s head like it was the sweetest symphony ever written. Her voice pitched and their dance forgotten, she relished in the way his tongue ran over the areas he bit. 


  The hand under her sweater moved up to the outline of her bra, poking his thumb under the wire until he could brush the swell of her breast. Her palm remained on top of his and she let him feel her up, no concern for peeping eyes. 


  His lips sucked on her neck, making her knees weak and body slump almost entirely into his. Draco took a step forward and pinned her body into the metal bar. Hermione was panting and desperately grasping at his neck, trying to pull him impossibly closer, never wanting his lips to leave. 


  He removed his hand from her sweater and brought it up to rest on her neck, turning her face to his. His teeth took her earlobe before lightly sucking. The only thing racing through her mind was 
  
    more, please, give me more. 
  


  While he trailed his lips across her cheek, he pulled back to momentarily look at her. Hermione’s eyes were low but he could tell the normal syrup colored eyes were taken over by her pupils. Her breathing was coming out in heavy exhales, her scent hitting his nostrils like freight train. They both moved to close the distance until it sounded like someone was shouting Draco’s name over the pulsing music. 


  Their eyes opened, lips only a hair apart, but then they heard his name again, this time louder. 


  Pulling away, their expressions were equally confused. Both their heads snapped down below them, trying to identify the person who was so desperately yelling for Draco’s attention, and even more desperate to ruin the obvious moment the two were sharing. 


  Their eyes quickly found Blaise and Ginny, goofily waving up at them while making suggestive faces. Draco and Hermione had not stepped away from each other, keeping their former embrace. It wasn’t until Blaise yelled for them to come downstairs that they reluctantly pulled apart. Warmth was lost but the fire between them still burning. 


  Draco took Hermione’s hand in hers and led them downstairs, and she still wondered why it was so cold after all this time. 


  Meeting the inquisitive yet amused Blaise and Ginny at the bottom of the stairs, Draco let go of her hand as soon as they hit the ground. Hermione could feel the awkwardness as their two friends eyed them, concealing teasing grins. Now that she was surrounded by other people, the weight of what she had just done began to settle and instead of a light carefree feeling, she felt paranoid. 


  “Didn’t mean to interrupt, but we were leaving to grab some late night food. It’s getting a little too crowded here.” Ginny explained, looking back from Hermione to Blaise who sweetly had a hand on her lower back. 


  “We saw you two were…uh, still here and decided to ask if you wanted to join.” Blaise continued, eyeing Draco with a knowing smirk. 


  Hermione couldn’t say anything. They had been caught  fondling each other and seconds away from what was most likely a mind blowing experience. Aggravated when they first were interrupted, she was now grateful the two blind dates had called them away, Hermione wasn’t sure how far she would have let it go. 


  “Thanks.” Draco snapped at Blaise, and he only chuckled back at him. Ginny was trying to capture Hermione’s attention but she was too mortified to glance at her best friend.


  “So are you two up for it?” Blaise pressed, raising his eyebrows at Draco and Hermione. 


  When she heard no one talking, Hermione raised her heavy head, a wave of tiredness and embarrassment crashing over her. She kept her eyes on Ginny, but she felt both tall Slytherin men staring at her. 


  “I’ll pass. I’m feeling really tired, I’m just going to head home. I’ll see you at the flat.” She told her. 


  Ginny’s eyes flashed to Draco’s and scanned him head to toe. She looked back to her friend who was clearly inebriated with something and sent her a doubtful look. “Are you sure?” 


  “Yeah. Have fun though, I won’t wait up for you.” Hermione smiled, while running a hand down her face. The slowed effects of the drug had made her overly sleepy and nothing sounded better than sinking into her mattress and pillows. 


  She could feel Draco still looming over her as she spoke, but she had no strength to look at his face, it was easier to ignore him. 


  “Can you get home safely?” Ginny questioned and before Hermione could respond Draco cut her off. 


  “I’ll walk you to the nearest floo.” His voice was low and she looked up at him once before her eyes lingered on his collarbone.


  “No I can apparate, I'm fine.” She protested. 


  “You shouldn’t do that, especially since this is your first time smoking. Let me walk you to the floo.” He pushed back. Now it was Blaise that cut off her objections. 


  “I think that’s best Granger. Apparation will be harder and the nearest floo is only a few blocks away.” Blaise tapped Ginny’s back with his fingers and she took the hint. The red head nodded and gave Hermione her most persuasive voice. 


  “They’re right Hermione. That’s nice of you Malfoy, thank you for offering.” Ginny made it finalized with her sentence and Blaise grinned at her. Malfoy only nodded at the witch and rolled his eyes at his snickering best friend. 


  “Come on Granger.” Draco spoke. 


  Hermione wanted to groan. She could have handled this on her own, the fresh air would have helped clear her hazy mind and she most certainly wanted to berate Ginny for not so subtly foisting Malfoy on her. 


  Quickly saying goodbye to her friend and Blaise, both of whom held shit eating grins, she pushed past people to reach the exit. As soon as she got outside she took a deep inhale of the cool air. She looked left and right a few times, trying to get her bearings, but Malfoy was right beside her, already placing a hand on her back to push her left. 


  “This way.” He told her.


  Hermione stepped away from him so his hand fell from her back. She crossed her arms over her body and stuffed her hand under her upper arms, trying to preserve as much body heat as possible. Her legs were moving fast but she noticed Draco’s long legs were barely moving as quick as her. Every two steps she took, he only took one. 


  Her whole body went back to being stiff and wound up, all the work Draco had done, gone into the abyss. The annoyance almost radiated off her body and Draco wanted to apologize but he didn’t know what for or what her problem was. 


  Hermione wasn’t upset for any particular reason. Feeling more disappointed in herself for allowing the opinions of others push her to do things she normally wouldn’t do. It was unlike her and she hardly ever cared about the opinions of others, good or bad, but she was so desperate to prove Malfoy wrong. Watching him look cool and composed all night, she wanted to beat him at his own game and succeeded, but now it just felt silly.


  After a moment of silence, she heard Draco take a deep inhale and immediately smelled tobacco. She crinkled her nose and looked at the white thing between his fingers. Unable to push down the misplaced annoyance, she spoke with a sense of disdain in her voice. 


  “Why do you smoke, it’s disgusting.” She glared at him, unintentionally picking up her speed. 


  Draco took a drag and huffed it above his head, watching the cloud fall back behind them. He merely shrugged at her, unbothered by her sudden change of behavior. “I think there’s some addictive chemicals in here or something.” 


  Hermione halted in tracks and gaped at him. “Is that supposed to be funny?” 


  Draco smirked while the cigarette hung loosely from his lips. His fingers plucked it away and he moved his head side to side, his eyes looking up at the sky as he blew to the smoke up falsely contemplating her question. 


  “It was a little funny.” He shrugged again, eyes casted down as he flicked the ash off the butt end. 


  Hermione rolled her eyes and kept walking. Her legs felt heavy and her vision was still blurring on the corners. All she wanted was to be home in her warm big bed. 


  “No it’s not. Those are horrible for you and unhealthy and I don’t know why you decided it was smart to smoke.” She grumbled at him. 


  Draco raised his eyebrows and looked over at her. “Didn’t think you’d care so much about my health or what I do, Granger.” 


  Dammit. Instead of lecturing him, she should have remained silent. “I don’t.” 


  Draco ignored her and threw the cigarette onto the streets. “Look it’s too cold and we still have two blocks to walk so why don’t you tell me where you live and I’ll apparate us as close as possible.” 


  Hermione stopped. That actually sounded like a good idea, she just didn’t want to admit it. 


  “Fine. Do you know where Fiddle Faces Cafe is? Off Twelfth Place?” Hermione walked back over to Draco, her arms still over her chest. 


  “Yeah, I know exactly where that is.” He told her, raising a hand to run through his hair. She was momentarily distracted when she caught sight of the constellations on his arm. 


  “Perfect,” she licked her lips once, “Mine and Ginny’s flat is a half block away.” 


  Draco raised one hand up to her, quirking his brow at her. “Ready when you are.” 


  Hermione kept his eye contact. It was hard to be annoyed when the moon illuminated his face like it was sparkling. He really was quite attractive. 


  Grabbing his hand, their bodies were pulled and stretched until they landed safely on their feet. Hermione felt even more sober than before, wondering if the apparation had helped in any way. She remembered Draco had smoked more than her and felt herself panic when she realized how risky and dangerous that was. Just as she was ready to tell him off again, his silky voice cut her off. 


  “I don’t know what I did wrong but I apologize if I crossed any boundaries.” He began, his eyes straight ahead as he started walking down the street. “Being high and giving consent isn’t true consent and I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable or took it too far.” 


  Hermione couldn’t believe what he was saying. She didn’t view the night like he had forced her to do anything at all, she was just upset that the pressure of other men’s words got to her. 


  “I hope you know, that’s not who I am.” He continued. “Regardless of my past, I treat women with the utmost respect and you are certainly a witch that has every ounce of my respect…just so you know.” Draco coughed awkwardly over the last part and even though her brain was foggy, she didn’t think all this was necessary. 


  “Malfoy you didn’t— I mean…nothing, no boundaries were crossed.” She thankfully found her voice to be strong while she spoke despite tripping over some words. She stopped on the pavement, but her body felt like it was still moving, the remaining effects of the drug still in her system. 


  Draco looked down at the short witch, her cheeks were stained pink from the cold and her hair looked even more disheveled than it was at the Cherry Pit. He didn’t say anything, he just watched her lips move as she spoke. 


  “I know I’m high but I still— I still wanted…all those things.” She softly spoke, her eyes slowly meeting his. 


  “Really?” He breathed. 


  She nodded and chewed on her cheek. “I’m not mad at you, I’m just…annoyed with myself.” She quietly admitted, feeling like she should explain herself so Draco wouldn’t feel guilty for his more than welcomed actions. “Both you and Blaise made a comment about how I’m uptight and the Cherry Pit isn’t my scene, and I guess I wanted to prove you and every other guy wrong.” 


  Draco’s forehead creased, he didn’t think he said anything too bad. He certainly didn’t mean his words with animosity, he made an indifferent observation. But now he felt remorse if it wounded her feelings or coerced her into doing something she didn’t want to do. 


  “So…you regret tonight because you felt…peer pressured?” Draco offered, not sure if that's what she meant. 


  Hermione shook head and felt amused at how ridiculous this all felt suddenly. “No. I don’t think I regret anything.” She looked away from Draco’s face, feeling still slightly embarrassed that not thirty minutes ago, she was moaning in his arms. “I’m annoyed that others, specifically men, view me as uptight or boring and even more annoyed that I care so much.” 


  Draco let her words sit in the air a moment before responding. Hermione Granger just disclosed to him she felt insecure. He was astounded anyone could make her feel such a thing, seeing as she was the most accomplished witch at her age as well as physically appealing to every male eye. Looking at the worry on her face, he couldn’t help but laugh. 


  Hermione felt her defense rise and she couldn’t believe after sharing something slightly personal, he’d laugh at her. She promptly turned on her heel and left him standing in the street.


  Draco run up to her and stepped in front of her path. “Whoa whoa. Hold on a second.” 


  “I don’t appreciate being laughed at, Malfoy.” 


  “First, I’m not laughing at you Granger. I’m shocked at the notion that you could still care about any bloody worthless opinion from a less than worthy man, especially me.” He stated and her mouth parted, shocked by the compliment and his self-deprecating statement.


  “Second.” He took a step into her personal space, her eyes blinking up at him as he gave her a soft, comforting smile. “You’re not boring. You’re a hell of a lot more fun and interesting than any other witch in Britain, based on this night alone.” 


  Hermione felt her chest warm. The words he spoke felt sincere and comforted her in all the right ways. Despite priding herself on being independent, she still enjoyed hearing validation from men, using it as reassurance before her insecurities got out of hand. She pondered if she enjoyed hearing Draco’s validation more because of their past or if it was because of their night. 


  “Really?” She asked him, her eyes wide with hope and vulnerability. 


  “Yeah. I’m glad I could help you relax.” His mouth twitched upwards and Hermione felt herself flush regardless of the cool temperature of the night. 


  Clearing her head, she took a step to the side. She needed to get away from him, his cologne was too enticing and she wasn’t sure if she could still make logical decisions. 


  “Thank you for getting me home safely.” She told him as she stepped forward. She turned her body to walk backwards, Draco smirked. He took a step to mimic her path. Hermione glanced down at his moving feet, then back up to his predatory gaze. 


  “Of course. I’m more than happy to be of service.” He continued forward as she paced backward, only a few steps away from each other. 


  “I’ll be going to bed.” She said, her nervousness showing. “I’m very tired.” 


  “Same here. Quite sleepy.” Draco’s gray eyes shined in delight and the brightness of the moon caught them perfectly, it made Hermione gasp. 


  “Well. Thank you again, and goodn—“ Her words died in her throat when her back collided with her front door and Draco stood toe to toe with her. 


  Her head uncomfortably rested on the wood as she stared up at him. His pink lips were damp from the wetness of his tongue, and he gave her a look that made her stomach clench. Her chest was moving at a rapid speed while he took calm and controlled breaths. He gave her a charmed smile. 


  Cool fingertips floated over her hand and she almost jerked in surprise. She watched as Malfoy brought her hand up to his lips, his intense eyes never leaving hers, and kissed the skin.  


  “Sweet dreams Granger.” He mumbled against her skin before releasing his hold and backing away from her. She watched him pull out his silver holster from his back pocket and removed a cigarette, lighting it and taking one puff before disapparating from her street. 

  
    Chapter Text
    
  “Hermione Jean Granger! Wake up you absolute 
  
    slag!”
  


  Ginny jumped onto the pile of covers that appeared to be in a human body form. She yelled as she pulled back the sheets to reveal a very messy haired witch beneath them who had her hands over her beat red face. 


  “Ginny please…It’s only—“ Hermione groaned from under her hands and honestly thought she could use at least one more hour of sleep.


  “It’s nearly noon. You slept all bloody morning and I couldn’t wait a second longer. Now get up and explain to me how in Merlin’s name you ended up grinding on Draco Malfoy and almost kissed him last night.” She shrieked while successfully stripping Hermione’s hands away from her face. 


  Hermione pouted at her redhead friend sitting above her. “Don’t you want to tell me about your first date with Blaise?” 


  “Noooope! This is more interesting. Talk!” Ginny moved off her but scooted her body under the wrinkled covers to join her. Hermione begrudgingly sat up against her headboard and sighed.


  “I—I didn’t think all that would happen.” She began and Ginny snickered at her. 


  “I’ll say. One minute, Blaise told me you were heading home, the next I see Malfoy sucking on your neck like a greedy little vampire.” Ginny explained, total amazement at the situation all over her face. 


  “Ugh. Ginny please.” Hermione groaned, her hands flying to her face again to hide her shame. 


  “Okay, okay no more teasing. Continue.” Ginny said, folding her hands on top of the covers and giving Hermione her best attentive face. 


  “After Blaise walked over to you, I was finishing my drink at the bar. Someone popped up next to me a few minutes later and it was Malfoy. We started talking about the blind date and the Cherry Pit. I finished my entirely too strong drink and then we took shots together and then…” She trailed off, still not believing how easy it was for Malfoy to whisk her away. 


  Ginny shook her in her arms, desperate for the hot piece of gossip her friend engaged in last night. “And then? Come on, finish the story.” 


  Hermione laughed and swatted her hands off her. “And then he told me to come with him, so I did. He led us upstairs and we sat on this loveseat—“ 


  “Loveseat eh?” Ginny teased and wiggled her head. 


  “Shut up.” She smacked her leg and they both laughed. “He pulled out a blunt and I got high with him.” 


  “Whoa, hang on. Not only were you allowing Malfoy to feel you up, but you also partook in illicit drug use? Hermione, who are you?” Ginny joked and she laughed. 


  “I know, I know. I was bad for the night.” She shook her head and gave Ginny a playful look. 


  “With the baddest boy in all of England, at that.” Ginny added and Hermione shrugged but continued on. 


  “Once I started to feel a little high, he asked if I liked to dance and I told him no. But I somehow agreed to let him lead me over to the balcony where we people watched and then he started asking me questions…” Hermione looked over at Ginny who had her eyebrows raised to the very top of her forehead, anxiously and excitedly waiting for more. 


  “Oh? Questions?” Ginny prodded. 


  “Yes, questions like, if I liked watching others dance and if I…wanted to be touched like that.” Hermione blushed furiously, finishing the last part of her sentence in a hushed tone hoping that Ginny couldn’t hear, but of course, she did. 


  It was Ginny’s turn to slap Hermione on the leg. “Shut the fuck up.” 


  Hermione nodded and swallowed the lump in her throat. “We started dancing, and his hands started, erm, roaming, and then he started to kiss my neck and, if he were to continue, I think I might have let him…kiss me.” She peeked over at Ginny who had her mouth hung open in an exuberant smile. 


  “Looked like if Blaise and I hadn’t interrupted you were going to do a lot more than kissing!” 


  Hermione groaned again and threw her head against her headboard. 


  “Well what happened when you guys left?” 


  Hermione looked up at her ceiling, an unusual feeling of disappointment hanging low in her stomach. “Nothing. We chatted, he apparated us up the block and then he walked me home. Said goodnight and that was that.” 


  Ginny gave her a disbelieving look. “That’s it? No goodnight kiss, no promise to see each other again?” 


  Hermione looked confused. “Why would I see him again?” 


  “Because Blaise said—“ Ginny began but soon stopped herself, not thinking it was wise to bring up the new information she had learned to Hermione right now. She seemed disoriented from the experience. 


  “Blaise said…?” Hermione waited, knowing right away that Ginny was withholding something notable from her. 


  “Blaise just mentioned…that they’d be going out to the Cherry Pit again. Tonight. And he invited us.”


  Hermione assessed the careful words Ginny chose and didn’t think that was what she had to share. 


  “Did he?” She asked, crossing her arms over her knees and tilting her head to one side. 


  “Um, yeah.” Ginny awkwardly said, removing herself from the cozy bed. “Malfoy didn’t invite you?” 


  Hermione snorted and slumped her body back down into the bed. “He said goodnight and I went to bed. Why would he invite me out again?” She interrogated. 


  Ginny simply shrugged. “Seemed like you two were enjoying each other’s company last night so I just assumed he would.” 


  Hermione shook her head. “Those were the drugs and alcohol making us do those things.” 


  Ginny made a puffing sound. “Yeah right.” 


  “What? I’m being serious!” Hermione defended. 


  “So are you saying sober you wouldn’t want sober Malfoy to touch and kiss you like that?” Ginny threw back at her and Hermione went silent for a moment. Ginny smiled. “Aha, that’s what I thought.” 


  “You didn’t give me any time to answer!” Hermione tried, lightly laughing. 


  “We both know the answer already. There’s no shame, Hermione, honestly. Malfoy is extremely fit and oh gods, those tattoos look so good on him. He’s got this dark and mysterious aura about him, it’s insanely attractive wouldn’t you agree?” Ginny rambled and Hermione found herself silently agreeing to every statement in her mind. 


  “So, you’re coming tonight with me, no exceptions, no protests. Blaise said to get there around quarter to eleven, they’ll have a table ready for us.” 


  Hermione huffed and Ginny put her hands on her hips. “Now what?” 


  Hermione only shook her head, suspicious that Ginny had still not explained every pertinent detail. “I feel like I’m being set up for something.” 


  Ginny rolled her eyes. “Don’t be so childish. We’re going out tonight because Blaise asked us to. So suck it up and wear that black dress tonight.” 


  “What? No way. Why should I?” Hermione argued. 


  “Because last night you were dressed like you were going to the grocery store. Tonight you’re dressing like you’re going to a club and that’s final.” Ginny told her then strutted out of the room before Hermione could get another word in. 


  She groaned into her pillow but a tingle in her toes spread all the way up to her chest when she thought about facing Malfoy again. She couldn’t decide if that tingle was dread or excitement, but it was most likely an even mixture of both. 



  Hermione tripped in the heels Ginny had leant her for the fourth time already. Her arm reached for Ginny’s shoulder so she could steady herself and she cursed herself for being persuaded into wearing them. 


  “I swear to Merlin Hermione I will shave off all your hair while you sleep if you break those heels.” Ginny warned her and helped her re-balance herself on the cement. 


  “Sorry. It’s been awhile since I’ve worn heels and the roads are uneven.” Hermione pouted down at the bright red shoes, loving the way the straps wrapped around her ankles. 


  They reached the outside of The Cherry Pit, a small crowd of witches and wizards waiting to get in alongside the building. Hermione was worried that they would have to wait with the noisy crowd but Ginny guided them up to where a tall, burly wizard stood in all black. The man barely looked at them before stepping to the side and waving his wand for the entrance door to open. 


  “What was that?” Hermione asked, not understanding why they could skip the line of irritated club goers. 


  “We’re on the list.” Ginny told her.


  “What list?” Hermione questioned, still not understanding. 


  “
  
    The 
  
  list Hermione. Now come on, I think I see them.” Ginny grabbed her hand and politely pushed them into the sea of people. 


  The Cherry Pit was more crowded than the night before and Hermione could feel her nerves bubble up into her throat. Her attire was not modest in any way and she felt uncomfortable having people look at her like she was on display at some museum. Hermione focused on not falling over in her heels, doing her best to ignore the points and stares in her direction.


  The black dress Ginny had made her wear was halter style, with a completely open back. The thick straps covered her breasts and tied behind her neck, so she could wear no bra, much to Ginny’s pleasure. The dress came to thankfully rest only a few inches above her knees, so nothing underneath would accidentally ride up or poke out when she sat down. 


  Ginny had assured her she looked like a witch straight off the runway but now since she was out in the open, with people pointing and staring, she felt out of place. It seemed that everyone knew this wasn’t her style nor her usual hangout. She was sticking out like a sore thumb and already planned to make an escape so she wouldn’t have to constantly swallow down her anxiety. 


  “There they are.” Ginny said, pulling Hermione closer to her side while she waved at Blaise with the other hand. 


  Hermione saw Draco leaning against the tall table, his large back facing her, his luminescent hair the only other physical characteristic she could see. He wore tighter black slacks, ditching the jeans tonight, accompanied by an aegean colored button up. His sleeves were rolled down for the moment and she frowned, not being able to see his stained skin right away. 


  She saw Blaise lean across the table and nod his head at the two of them approaching the table. Draco stood up and turned half of his body in their direction. 


  Hermione and Draco locked eyes. She felt her body heat under his dark gaze. His stare slowly moved over her red heels, up the length of her legs and focused on her dress before reaching her face, where he wet his lips with a careful lick of his tongue. His face remained impassive and Hermione was grateful Ginny was holding her hand, she was certain her legs were going to give out. 


  “Hello boys.” Ginny greeted happily, releasing Hermione’s hand so she could walk to the other side of the table where Blaise stood. He helped her into the high seat and scooted her chair in like a true gentleman. 


  “You look beautiful.” Blaise told her, his eyes raking over the tight white dress Ginny chose to wear, it complimented her complexion that had made Hermione completely jealous. She blushed and quietly thanked him when he kissed her hand.


  Hermione couldn’t bring herself to meet Draco’s eyes again, but he did hold out her chair and wait until she was properly comfortable before scooting her in. He didn’t say anything to her, didn’t compliment her outfit, or tell her she looked beautiful like Blaise did to Ginny. He just stood next to her, taking a long gulp of his whiskey before undoing the top button of his shirt. 


  Stupidly, she realized that Blaise and Ginny were on a date, and her and Draco weren’t. There was no need for compliments or exchanges of longing looks. The unpleasant feeling in her stomach shouldn’t have bothered her so much but it did, and neither should have Draco’s silence wounded her pride so much, but again, it did. 


  Hermione placed her hands on top of her thighs and picked at a loose hangnail. She didn’t hear Blaise when he asked what they would like to drink and she didn’t hear Ginny call her name for attention. Draco nudged her with his elbow and she looked up to him, his eyebrows up in question. 


  “What?” She asked a little too harshly which made Draco’s mouth tug up. 


  “What do you want to drink?” He asked and Hermione sheepishly looked back to Blaise and Ginny who were waiting for her to respond. 


  “Oh um, a green goblin is fine.” She told him. 


  Draco nodded once and raised his arm, motioning someone over with just two fingers. A waiter appeared before them and Draco told him the drink requests. Hermione focused her attention on Ginny and Blaise, not wanting to appear bothered by the lack of attention Malfoy was granting her. It was a strange thought, he was all over her yesterday, giving her compliments, smirking at her, being in her space all night. Did he regret it now? Did he realize who she was? 


  The waiter came back with their drinks and a small dish of cherries. Draco took the two cherries out of the bowl and popped them into his mouth, the sweet juices trickled down the corner of his mouth when he first crunched down on them. Hermione turned her attention away from his wetted lips and picked up her drink, her palms felt sweaty. 


  “So, Granger,” Blaise began, “how do you like The Cherry Pit?” 


  Hermione thought it was an odd question to ask and briefly thought he was teasing her since he knew of her distaste of night clubs, but his tone was serious and even Ginny looked perplexed by the question. 


  “It’s uh, fine, I suppose. Seems like the business is doing well for itself.” She was unsure of how to answer. 


  She noticed Draco again raised his hand to ask for the waiter to come over, they did almost instantaneously and Hermione wondered if he frequented here enough to make in with the wait staff. Draco ordered two rounds of shots as Blaise spoke. 


  “Yes it is. Too bad the owner is a bit of a tosser.” He spoke over the rim of his glass. 


  “You know the owner?” Ginny interjected and Blaise nodded with a smirk. 


  “Oh yeah. We go way back actually.”


  The waiter appeared with eight tiny shot glasses, all filled with the same purple liquid that Hermione had yesterday. 


  “Who is it? Someone from the quidditch leagues?” Ginny pestered, handing out the shots to every person. 


  Hermione was hardly paying attention anymore since Draco had taken out a cigarette and placed it behind his ear. She wanted to take that thing and rip it in half. 


  “No. You actually know the owner, both of you do.” Blaise said and this caught Hermione’s attention. 


  “Well who is it?” Ginny asked again and Draco reached for a couple of cherries. He chewed on them slowly and Hermione looked at the bowl then back to him. Draco turned his head, his sharp jaw moving up and down with every chew. 


  “The Cherry Pit?” Hermione asked, nodding at the bowl and Draco gave her a slow, cat like grin. 


  “Surprised?” Draco asked back and raised his shot glass. Everyone followed suit, touching their glasses together in the air. “Free drinks tonight, tomorrow and every day after for you ladies.” 


  “And me.” Blaise chirped. 


  “Hell no.” Draco mused before Ginny and Hermione giggled. 


  The group tipped their heads back and swallowed the first shot, then picked up the second and chased it again. Hermione could have five more of them, she hardly tasted any alcohol but she figured that was the point. 


  Blaise and Ginny began talking about her upcoming quidditch season, and Draco joined in. Hermione listened intently, not feeling like she could add anything of substance to the conversation but still wanted to be polite. She glanced around the club, seeing the dance floor was essentially packed and that people were still waiting outside to get in. 


  She felt bad for taking up a spot when she didn’t feel like being there in the first place. Even if it wasn’t a date, she didn’t enjoy feeling left out and she certainly didn’t like putting in so much effort into her appearance for such a little response. It felt pointless and Hermione didn’t understand why she was so bent on getting a bigger reaction from him.


  Scratch that. She knew why. It was simply because Malfoy had been the only wizard in a long time to pay her any mind other than having it be related to work. She wanted to feel wanted again, desired and sought after. Yesterday he had made her feel irresistible and now she felt embarrassed for reading him in all the wrong ways. And the odd looks she got from men when she first arrived obviously meant to her that no one would be coming up to her tonight. 


  Draco noticed the silent witch beside him and removed himself from the former conversation. He stepped closer to her chair and rested his arm over the back of it. 


  “What’s wrong?” Draco suddenly asked her and Hermione glanced at him once before rolling her eyes. 


  “I think I’ll head home soon after this.” She picked up her drink and began sucking it down. 


  Draco made a face. “Why?” 


  Hermione didn’t like that he was looking at her like she was stupid. He should be relieved that she wants to leave, now he won’t have to babysit her. 


  “I don’t feel like third wheeling tonight.” She told him, bobbing her head to their friends who were sending flirty smiles at each other. 


  “You’re not third wheeling. I’m here.” Draco told her. 


  “Sorry. We’re third wheeling then.” Hermione said and watched his face remain as still as a statue. His long fingers took the cigarette from behind his ear and placed it between his lips. Draco turned his face away from hers to light it then blew the smoke in the opposite direction. She cringed. 


  “I thought you learned your lesson about having fun and letting go yesterday?” He inquired, watching her mouth part since she was caught off guard by his question. 


  “I did.” She tried. Draco took a puff and tilted his head up to blow the air out, his Adam’s apple bobbed and the skin of his neck looked so smooth. 


  “Bollocks. If you did then you wouldn’t be planning your escape already.” 


  Hermione chewed on her lip while looking down at her hands. Her eyes shifted from Blaise and Ginny and then over her shoulder to the club attendees. 


  “Yesterday I didn’t care if I was the odd one out and easily proved how I could be like everyone else. But today feels like everyone knows I don’t belong even with me trying to blend in.” Hermione explained, doing her best to hide her insecurity. 


  Draco, who listened very intently, took a sip and watched the small frown on her dark red lips. “What makes you say that?” He asked, looking down at her eyelashes hit her cheek. He noticed she was so small compared to him, even sitting in the chair, he felt his body crowding over hers. 


  She shrugged and let out a disbelieving, cynical laugh. “I went out of my comfort zone. I dressed up in appropriate dance club attire and before we left the flat I felt good. Now people are looking and pointing and it just feels like they all know I’m a try-hard.” 


  Draco could have laughed in her face at the admission, but instead he felt his chest hollow when he realized Granger had felt worried about her appearance. Taking a drag, he looked at her uncomfortable expression. Perhaps she thought he wasn’t the best company for the evening but he’d be damned if he let her think she didn’t look stunning. 


  “Granger,” Draco said, peeping over at his mate to make sure he was occupied. He turned his head down, neck craning and moved his body to hers. Her head was casted downwards, some of her hair fell over her exposed shoulder and he lightly moved his fingers to pull it onto her back. She tensed up at his movement but allowed him to do it. His lips were right by her ear, as if he was about to tell her the best secret in the world. 


  “People aren’t pointing and looking at you because you’re the odd one out. They’re either all jealous of you or wondering how they can persuade you to come home with them tonight.” Draco spoke and Hermione frowned. She lifted her head to look at him, but all she saw was an intense gaze that dared her to fight back. 


  She shook her head once, smelling his smell, cologne mixed with smoke, hints of cherries, it made her brain cloudy. He didn’t move back, their faces were close and she could see the moisture from the cherries over his lips. 


  “That’s not—“ 


  “Don’t play dumb Granger it’s not a good look on you.” Draco cut her off. “You are the sexiest witch in here tonight and everyone knows it.” 


  The way his lips curved over his compliment made her stomach twist and turn. Silver eyes bore into her own, ensuring she knew he was being truthful. There was nowhere else to look or nothing to say, he rendered her silent with his statement. 


  A small quirk of his lips made Hermione nervous and before she could ask, Draco began speaking again. “I would even bet that if me and Blaise were to walk away for five minutes, some arrogant bloke would come over and chat you up immediately.” 


  Hermione had to laugh at this. “That wouldn’t happen.” She told him. Men don’t approach her anymore and there was hardly an interesting view thrown her way tonight. Men were staring sure, but she read their expressions as if they were asking what she was doing dressed up like that. 


  “Want to bet?” Draco dared, his eyes darkening with each breath. 


  Hermione squinted at him. Unable to deny the opportunity to prove she clearly knew more about how men perceived her than he did, she lifted her chin and threw him a playful grin. 


  “You’re on.” She brought her glass to her lips, keeping his eye contact while the alcohol slid down her throat. Draco intently watched her lips close over the rim, his eyes flickered back up to hers.


  “Name your price.” His voice almost came out like a purr, her tongue unconsciously running over her top lip while she thought. 


  “If I win…I get to go home and you have to owl me a bottle of whatever that grape tasting shot is.” 


  Draco smiled and shook his head. “Done. I’ll even send you a bottle as a consolation prize when you lose.” 


  Hermione rolled her eyes. “Not going to happen.” 


  Draco almost laughed at her ignorance. This witch was blind. 


  “But if I win,” His voice dropped a few octaves and Hermione felt herself inhale sharply. “You stay the entire night and we relax a bit, yeah?” 


  Narrowing her eyes at him, she was unsure if when he said relax he meant something similar to the previous night or to just continue on with third wheeling with Blaise and Ginny. Deciding not to care and also thinking she wasn’t going to lose, Hermione looked him square in his gray eyes and said, “Deal.” 


  Draco smirked at the witch and took a few steps away from her. His head moved to his best friend. “Blaise, help me with something at the bar?” 


  Blaise and Ginny both turned to the pair, confusion spreading over their features. Zabini looked between the couple in front of him and gave Draco a quizzical brow. “Um, sure.” He said, excusing himself away from Ginny and asking Draco what was so important that he needed to take him away from Ginny. 


  Ginny leaned over the table. “What was that about?” 


  “I made a bet with Malfoy.” Hermione told Ginny, feeling her body tingle with the buzz of alcohol. 


  The redhead made an amused face before taking a sip of her drink and looking back to the bar where the men stood, both of them watching the table. “Oh? About what?” 


  “He said someone would come over and try to woo me once they got up from the table.” Hermione explained, knowing the notion to be totally ridiculous. 


  Ginny just raised her eyebrows. “And you think they’re not?” 


  Hermione gave her a weird look. “Of course not.” 


  Ginny laughed openly at Hermione and she suddenly felt defensive. 


  “What? You agree with him?” Hermione asked. 


  “Duh. You’re dressed to the nines and look like a goddess. I’d be surprised if it’s only one man that approaches you tonight.” Ginny stated as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Hermione began to panic. If her best friend agreed with Draco, then that means she might have been reading people wrong all night. Pulling herself together, she curled a piece of hair behind her ear and spoke knowingly. 


  “Well it's not going to happen. Just watch.” She nervously finished the rest of her drink and Ginny shook her head, finding it amusing how silly and innocent her best friend could be. 


  “You say that, but there’s some handsome wizard walking over here right now, eyeing you up like you’re his last meal.” Ginny snickered into her own drink, mimicking Hermione and topping it off. 


  Hermione’s eyes widened in fear and was about to ask Ginny if she was joking before a very lean looking man with dimples stopped at their table. 


  “Hello ladies.” He said to which both the girls gave a unanimous ‘hi’ back to the lad. The man looked at Hermione first and offered his hand. “I’m Michael.” 


  Hermione took it with small hesitation, her heart was beating wildly fast. “Hermione.” 


  Michael shook her hand twice, a very cute smile gracing his face. “Lovely name. And yours?” 


  “Ginny.” She responded. 


  “Pleasure. Are you two here alone tonight?” Michael asked right away and Ginny had a shit eating smile on her face. 


  “I’m actually on a date. But she’s not.” Ginny told him, and figuratively threw Hermione into open water. She tried to shoot her friend a glare but Michael was already speaking to her before she got the chance. 


  “Oh, well lucky for me. Can I buy you a drink?” Michael asked, taking a step to Hermione. Chewing on her bottom lip, she did think the wizard was very attractive, but she was mad because she knew Malfoy was watching the exchange unfold, probably laughing at how stubbornly wrong she was. Sod him. 


  “My friends are getting me one actually.” She replied. 


  “Ah that’s okay. Maybe a shot later?” He asked hopefully and Hermione felt herself give a genuine answer. 


  “Maybe.” She shyly responded. 


  “I’ll hold you to it. So Hermione, are you from the London area?” 


  Michael began conversing with Hermione and she could see out of the corner of her eye that Ginny was watching the two with delight. It’s not that Hermione was annoyed by Michael, he seemed to be nice and was pleasant to look at, she was just irritated that Malfoy had been right and she was wrong. And she despised being wrong. 


  After only a minute or so of conversation the lad asked Hermione if she wanted to dance. 


  “No, I’m sorry. I’m not the best dancer.” She told him. 


  “Neither am I, we can learn together.” Michael smiled, his words seemed so honest and harmless but it reminded her of last night when Draco said something similar. Heat flushed through her body and she stuttered as she began to speak. 


  “Um, th-that would be—“ 


  “Here you ladies go.” Blaise interrupted Hermione and she whipped her head to the side, seeing Draco and Blaise set down new drinks along with another round of shots, only this time they were a neon blue. 


  Draco was hiding a knowing grin and eyed Hermione with a look that said ‘I told you so.’ She wanted to slap him. 


  Michael offered an introduction to both men, Draco offered a very stiff response to the lad. Once the awkwardness over the exchange had ended, Michael returned his attention back on Hermione, even leaning in to speak directly into her ear. 


  “What do you say? One dance?” His eyes were so hopeful and Hermione would have said yes but—


  “I think I’m going to stay with my friends for the time being. I’m sorry.” She told him. 


  “No worries. Come find me later? I’ll be in the back corner booth towards the entrance.” Michael requested and Hermione nodded. He left with a smile and Hermione felt Draco laugh beside her. She didn’t have the courage to look him in his eyes in her defeat. 


  “I win.” He chided, pushing a shot towards her. 


  “Yes I’m aware, you bloody git.” She said before throwing the shot back into her mouth without waiting for anyone else. 


  “Hey it’s your own fault. I can’t believe you were daft enough to think no one would come up to you.” Malfoy told her, stretching his arm over the back of her chair, his fingers hanging loosely over the edge, only a few inches away from the skin of her arm. 


  Ginny and Blaise momentarily interrupted them to say they were heading to the floor to dance. Hermione smiled at the way Blaise grabbed a hold of Ginny with both arms and led her to the dance floor. She thought they looked cute. 


  “Honestly it was just absurd.” Draco said, placing yet another cigarette between his lips. 


  Unable to help herself Hermione reached up and plucked the stick out of his mouth and snapped it in two before throwing it on the table. She was pretty buzzed right now and she knew once she finished her second drink, she’d be very intoxicated. 


  Draco crinkled his eyebrows, wondering where in the hell her sudden burst came from. 


  “I told you my rationale for believing no one would approach me. It’s not like there are wizards lining up to date me or anyone going out of their way to call me beautiful.” She explained, deciding to take the last cherry in the dish and pop it into her mouth. 


  Gray eyes lowered onto her soft looking lips then down her body, stopping on the deep dip of fabric one her chest then moving down to her smooth legs. 


  Hermione felt her stomach clench in a very pleasing way as his eyes scanned her body. They shot up to her face, a glint of danger in them. 


  “Well I won. So it’s time to relax.” 


  Draco called for their waiter and he promptly brought them two more shots. Her eyes widened. 


  “I don’t know if I should have those.” Hermione warned. “I already feel good.” 


  Draco gave her a mischievous grin. “These will make you feel better.” 


  Her mind felt blurred but her body warmed any time he smiled at her. She supposed this was part of his winnings, taking shots and drinking until the sun rose. She could do this. 


  Draco raised his glass to hers. “Cheers.” 


  They drank both back to back and Hermione sighed heavily. “I still want the consolation bottle of whatever this concoction is.” She said to him, motioning to their now empty shot glasses. 


  “Of course Granger. I’m not a sore winner.” He said, his voice full of playfulness. Hermione snorted. 


  “Barmy.” She stated. 


  “Honest. I could have sat here and laughed at how quickly you lost and the lad’s poor attempt to make you swoon but I didn’t.” Hermione felt her cheeks warm with the new alcohol in her system and she decided she quite liked how much taller he was compared to her. 


  “I think you just did.” She wrinkled her nose at him, making him chuckle. “And he wasn’t bad. He was kind of cute.” She defended, remembering the deep dimples on the man’s face whose name she already forgot. 


  “Cute huh? Then why didn’t you take him up on his offer to dance.” Draco asked, his voice getting lower. Hermione wondered when he became so close to her body. She could feel the warmth radiated off him, or was it her own body heat? 


  “I’m not a good dancer.” She said, her eyes unblinking. Draco’s fingertips barely brushed the skin on her upper arm, making a shiver run through her spine from the coldness. His face lit up when he noticed the reaction, lips curling into a grin. Looking into his eyes uncoiled something deep inside her, she was drawn to how beautiful they were, how they shined like a knife under the light, entrancing and dangerous. 


  “That’s not true. You were good yesterday.” Draco whispered, his warm breath contrasting the cold of his fingers. He dragged them up and down her skin in small motions, catching her eyes floating shut at the sensation and smirked wider. 


  “That was different, I was high.” She weakly protested and Draco looked amused at her efforts. He leaned down, his lips just over the top of her ear. Her face was concealed by his chest, giving her the chance to take a proper inhale of his woodsy cologne. 


  “No it’s not. If I took you on the dance floor right now you’d move how you did last night. Wanna know why?” His voice sounded like the hot smoke she inhaled yesterday that made her brain flustered.


  “Why?” Hermione felt breathless, she wasn’t sure if he heard her. 


  “Because you liked feeling unrestricted. You enjoyed the eroticism you felt when we danced, when I touched and kissed you. You want to feel it again.” Draco’s hand moved down her side until it snaked around her waist and his palm gripped her hip. His chest was touching her, his whole body in her space. 


  She pulled back, needing to put some distance between them since his smell was making her more dizzy. His words made her hot and she found herself hanging on every syllable, wishing to hear him speak like that more, hear the heaviness in his voice. 


  In a cheeky move, Hermione decided to send him her most confident look and gave him a flirty smile. 


  “One more shot and that may happen.” Her eyes looked up at him, glossy and happy. Draco was stunned by her words but composed himself, quickly asking the waiter for two more. 


  Gods her hangover would be awful. 


  Hermione snagged the shot faster than Draco could give her and swallowed it fast, not waiting for him. She hopped off her chair, wobbling a little bit but sent him a delighted look. 


  “See you out there!” She waved back to him. Draco didn’t move for a moment, watching the way her legs looked in the red heels and her arse in the tight fabric of the dress. He snapped out of it when her body was disappearing into the crowd and began his descent upon her. 


  Hermione was weaving in between people, checking over her shoulder only once to see how close Draco was. He was easy to spot with his height. His blonde hair peeking over the crowd, predatory stare tracking her movement through the twisting bodies, he was like a snake in the grass, waiting to strike. 


  Smiling to herself, Hermione stopped at an open space and began to move to the music on her own accord. The alcohol made her feel uninhibited and she didn’t care if people were watching her. There was a sense of belonging that flowed through her body, it was something she waited to feel since she first walked through the doors. 


  Draco found the witch swaying her hips on beat to the heavy drums of the song, her long curls moving with her body, hands touching her stomach before drawing up to her neck. He licked his lips and closed the final paces between the two of them. His hands possessively gripped her hips and he yanked her body into his, loving the way her gasp sounded. 


  They danced, Hermione let him move her body and sometimes she’d control their movements. She’d lead his hands over her stomach and hips, he’d tease the skin where her dress ended on her thighs, his lips ghosted over her ear and she’d throw her head back to sulk in the feeling. 


  Songs had passed, Hermione had moved his shirt sleeves up to stare at the dark tattoos. Draco had let her, liking the way her nimble fingers tickled up his forearms. Draco bent his neck to attach her lips to her neck, she sighed and tilted her head, giving him more space to move. 


  Draco licked his tongue and collected the light sheet of sweat covering her skin. Hermione was vaguely aware that they had essentially stopped dancing and merely swung softly. Her chest was heaving and the lights were twirling behind her shut eyes, everything was moving in slow motion.


  Draco growled happily when Hermione let out a moan as he bit her, he swiftly turned the witch around in his arms and laced one hand through her curls, the other grasping her arse. 


  Hermione didn’t have time to think before his soft lips found hers.  His movements were purposeful, dominating, his mouth devoured hers and she never had been kissed so explicitly. His tongue wove into her mouth and tangled with hers, he tasted of grapes and cherries and tobacco. She sighed at his flavor, wanting to bottle it up and use it as a perfume. 


  Draco’s hands became greedy, groping and grasping at every curve of her body, always wandering for more. Though his palm was hot, Hermione could still feel the tips of his slender fingers slightly cool, the feeling soothed her. 


  Winding her arms around his neck and pushing her body closer into his, she took his bottom lip between her teeth and pulled until it snapped back into place. Draco’s eyes opened, black overtaking the cloudy gray and eyelids turned low, forehead glistening with small beads of sweat, cheeks pink and hair messy. He looked hot and Hermione almost moaned at the sight of him. 


  He reconnected their lips, movements slower but more intentional. They were fused together, deep motions making her center pull with happiness. His tongue was desperate and moved deeper into her mouth in rhythm with the current song playing in the club. They were somewhat still dancing after all. 


  When he pushed her hips into his and grinded forward, Hermione had to pull back and gasp. Her hair looked wild and it matched her eyes. Her lips were slightly swollen and slick with a mixture of their saliva. Her chest was moving up and down deeply, and Draco craved more. 


  He took a step back, using one hand to pin her to his side. Draco wordlessly led them off the dance floor, Hermione tucked into his side trying to focus on not stumbling, too concerned with the buzzing sensation he caused her body rather than where they were going. He led them to the back hallway, and stopped in front of a wooden door. Draco mumbled a word and the door swung open, revealing a dark room. 


  He ushered Hermione forward into the room and shut the door. The music was muffled and she could only hear her breathing and heartbeat. She wasn’t scared to be alone with him, her body was on fire and cried for his hands to touch her once more.


  The lights came on, the room was lit up by a deep blue, making Hermione feel like she was underwater. The was actually an office,, a large desk with papers all over, a glass cabinet behind it, a black velvet couch that matched the one upstairs was pushed up against a window. This is probably where Malfoy conducted his club business.


  Draco walked up behind her, one hand touching her arm, making goosebumps rise to the surface. 


  “Sit down.” He commanded and Hermione walked over to the couch. She ran her hands over the soft velvet, massaging her palm. 


  Draco soon joined her with two glasses of water, she quietly thanked him before chugging the whole glass in one sitting. She let out a deep satisfied sigh and Draco raised his brow at her. 


  “What? I was thirsty.” She shrugged and set the glass off to the side on the ground. 


  “Did you want more?” Draco asked, lightly laughing at the innocent response. 


  “No I’m okay, thank you.” Hermione felt her warmed cheeks with the back of her hands. Her body was hot, from dancing and being snogged by the attractive wizard next to her. Though her mind was hazy, she badly still wanted his lips back on hers, it was an incessant need, kind of like the need for a cigarette, she dopily thought. 


  She watched his throat move as he drank his water, hands engulfing the normal sized glass. His tattoos looked more fascinating under the dark blue light, casting different shadows that matched the pictures. Without a thought, she took his forearm into both her hands, fingertips swiping over the patterns. 


  Draco allowed her to grab him, her tiny touches felt calming and he had to prevent a relieved breath from slipping out. 


  Hermione reached his elbow and tried her best to push more of his shirt up. He stretched his arm out and helped her move the fabric up, exposing a scaly tail and a large wing. Even if she didn’t see all of his bicep tattoos, she knew what it was. 


  “A dragon? How predictable.” She teased, tracing over its tail. 


  Draco smirked. He sat still, eyes watching her face as her own explored his skin. Every so often her tongue would poke out and touch her lips or her head would tilt to one side to ponder the ink on his skin, wondering his reasons behind getting the tattoos. Leaning his head down, he placed a soft kiss on her lips, catching her gasp of surprise in his mouth.


  Hermione let her hands wander up his arms and onto his chest, taking hold of the fabric and pulling him closer. Draco’s hand slithered behind her back and rested on her far hip, scooting her into him while his other hand fell on top of her thigh. Fingertips and nails began delicately teasing the skin, she pushed her tongue against his in response. 


  Pushing her backwards, Hermione let her hands guide her body down until she was laid across the couch. Draco ’s knees on either side of her, he moved his lips down to her cheek and neck, lapping at the sensitive area just under her jaw. She released a noise that made Draco’s crotch tighten, she sounded heavenly. 


  His one hand pushed her knee away from the other and he began moving his fingertips up the inside of her thigh. Hermione bucked her hips up, looking for any contact to help relieve pressure but he was too far away. Draco sucked on her chest, his fingers finally ghosting over the lace of her panties. 


  His fingers rubbed over the lacy fabric, moving up and down before coming to the top and circling roughing against her clit. Hermione groaned, her center throbbing for his fingers. She dragged his head up her eye level and attacked his lips. She kissed him hurriedly, hoping his fingers would match the pace of their mouths. 


  Draco took the hint and moved away from her. He crawled back on the couch until he could kneel on the ground. He gave her a handsome smirk while grabbing her thighs and pulling her body to his face. Hermione’s dress moved up her body, but still didn’t expose her center, her eyes were low with want, patiently waiting for his next move. 


  Both hands went under the fabric and his fingers hooked into her panties. She watched his hands peel the material from her legs, his tongue wetting his lips when he removed them and held them up with one finger. 


  “Red lace?” Draco asked her, to which she had nothing meaningful to respond back with. Her eyes widened when he tucked the wet pair of panties into the pocket of his trousers. His eyes danced with fire. 


  Draco leaned down and began kissing and nipping at her thighs, whispering sweet nothings into the tender flesh. 


  “You look so beautiful Granger.” He told her before licking a line up her inner leg moving her dress higher until her center was completely on display. She was breathing erratically, probably panting much too loud.


  Hermione felt her chest tighten at his words and she shut her eyes when his tongue almost reached her mound. One of his fingers swiped her folds open and she heard him hiss as her hips twitched under the contact. 


  “Gods…so wet, so beautiful.” He mumbled more to himself, but Hermione still heard him. 


  Finally giving her the relief her body screamed for, Draco leaned forward to press his tongue harshly against her clit, the same time he inserted one of his long fingers into her. She cried out, hips bucking into his mouth but his forearms pinned her down as he tasted her. 


  He pumped his finger into her soaking center, encouraged by her heavy breathing and lovely pants. His tongue ran over her clit in patterns and then sucked when her whines would grow louder. She moaned, more loudly than she would have if she was completely sober. But she didn’t care, the pleasure of Malfoy’s mouth was overwhelming. 


  He added a second finger with ease, but the width of them together added to the intense build of her oncoming climax. Her toes began to tingle and her thighs burned, she felt her body start to shake every time he sucked her clit harshly. 


  The twisting and subtle curl of his fingers had her moans bouncing off the walls, drowning out the music. She was close.


  “Malfoy, I—I” She tried to tell him but he already knew. He could feel her walls squeezing him and she was squirmin wildly. 


  “Oh gods, right there! I’m so—so close.” He pushed his fingers into her deeper, hitting her sensitive spot and stroking it with every pump. He hummed into her center, the sound was primitive, it made her eyes roll back and her body catch on fire. 


  “Yes! Yes Malfoy!” She cried and felt her body flood with a mind-blowing orgasm. He flicked his tongue and sucked on her pussy until there were tears in her eyes. Her thighs were shaking violently against his head, and she tried to pull him away but he didn’t move until she was spent. His fingers pumped while her walls convulsed, and his tongue never stopped lapping at her juices. 


  It was too much, her body felt numb with pleasure and her ears began to ring. She tapped on his arm to get him to stop. With one final thrust of his digits and lick of his tongue, Draco pulled away. Hermione was seeing stars and her body was falling into a pit of exhaustion. 


  Draco crawled back up her body, laying beside her as he kissed her neck. She reached behind her, still trying to get her breathing under control as she held his head in place. Hermione’s eyes felt heavy, body felt limp and her mind was only focused on how sensational her climax was. 


  She was thoroughly satisfied. 


  Draco was still lightly kissing up her neck when her arm slipped from his hair and down onto the couch. He peered over at her and realized she had fallen asleep. Moving her hair out of the way, he kissed her sweetly on the cheek and laid down with her. Bringing his fingers into his mouth to suck her taste off of them, before he fell asleep himself. 


  
  

  
    Chapter Text
    
  Hermione sat in the living room waiting for Ginny to emerge in her next outfit. She had a date with Blaise and couldn’t decide if she should go casual or cute. 


  “Okay, I really like this one because the skirt is longer and I have more blouses that go with it. What do you think?” Ginny did a twirl and Hermione inspected the outfit with a skeptical look. 


  “Hmm. I think it could be the winner if you matched it with that sleeveless black button up.” Hermione told her and Ginny’s eyes lit up. 


  “Yes! You’re totally right, hold on.” Hermione chuckled as Ginny sprinted back into her room. She never saw her friend so worried about what to wear on a date, it was out of character for her. 


  Ginny walked back into the room, giving a silly strut and making pointed faces. Hermione laughed and began hooting and hollering at the show she was putting on. 


  “Perfect! I’m sure Blaise will enjoy crawling up your skirt later tonight.” She said, wiggling her eyebrows. 


  Ginny chuckled and twirled once more, looking into the mirror hung up on the wall. “I hope so. He’s been teasing me all bloody week with only a heavy snog when we meet up. I appreciate him being a gentleman but I’m ready to be ravished.” 


  Hermione wiped her hand down the side of her face and shook her head. They had been on two more dates since last weekend, Blaise took her out for dinner but promised to spend a longer, more intimate evening once the weekend arrived. Ginny had been starry eyed like a schoolgirl and Hermione found it so adorable. 


  “Well, if you wear that, I think you’ll get exactly what you want.” Hermione told her and Ginny spun around to give her a look. 


  “You know, if you weren’t such a bloody coward last week, you’d probably be getting ravished tonight too.” Ginny said, placing her hands on her hips and Hermione rolled her eyes. 


  “Not true.” She mumbled, looking away from her friend and feeling her cheeks warm. 


  After Malfoy had given her oral sex, she embarrassingly fell asleep only moments later. She woke up to him snoring in her ear when the sky began turning a lighter shade of blue. Panic crashed over her and she did her best to maneuver her body out of his arm’s death grip. Luckily for her, he rolled over in his sleep and she was released. 


  Too ashamed to face him, she slipped out of the office and apparated home immediately. She sunk into her bed and nursed a hangover the next day while she sat with the feeling of his tongue heavy in her mind. 


  “Yes true. You should have stayed.” 


  “No I shouldn’t have. There was nothing to say and it would have been uncomfortable.” Hermione argued with her yet again. Ginny was adamant that Hermione should have owled him the next morning, but she blew it off. 


  “You could have said, ‘hey can I have my knickers back and can you also go down on me again?’” 


  Hermione threw the couch pillow at Ginny which she successfully caught and immediately whipped back at her. Hermione gasped when it hit her head and Ginny began cackling. 


  “You are dead Ginerva!” Hermione squeaked and stood up, charging her friend with the pillow and only smacking her bum with it one time before their doorbell rang.


  The girls stopped laughing and looked at the door then back to each other in confusion. 


  “I thought your date with Blaise wasn’t for another three hours?” Hermione asked. 


  “It’s not. I wonder who that could be?” Ginny said, walking over to find out. Hermione pushed some of her hair back away from her face and stood waiting. 


  “Oh. Hi there.” Ginny said, surprise obvious in her voice. 


  “Hello. Is Granger home? I have something for her.” 


  Hermione heard a deep voice ask and her stomach flipped. Ginny took a few steps back to allow their guest to enter. She held her breath when Malfoy walked in, a bottle of purple liquid in one hand and a handsome smirk on his face. He was in dark blue denim and a black cotton shirt. His hair looked like he had been running his hands through it for the last hour and his tattoos were on full display. Her mouth parted at the sight of him. 


  “Hi.” Draco said, Ginny right by his side. 


  “Hi.” Hermione responded, it coming out like a question. 


  “A deals a deal. So I came by to drop this off.” Draco held up the bottle to her, walking a few steps to her and Hermione met him halfway. She couldn’t conceal the growing smile on her face. 


  “Thank you.” She spoke honestly. 


  “Of course. The drink is actually my own invention. I’m glad you liked it so much.” Draco explained and Hermione looked up to him. 


  “You created this?” 


  “Yeah, I work with distilleries and this was the first thing I created. A shot that tastes like fizzy grapes but got you drunk like you were drinking straight Ogdens.” Draco said, scratching the back of his head timidly, his bicep flexed with the movement. Hermione had to draw her eyes away from the muscles before it became too obvious she was staring. 


  “Brilliant.” She said. 


  “Thank you.” He responded. 


  Their eyes locked for two inhales before Ginny interrupted. 


  “Wish I would've received my own bottle.” She teased and Draco looked back at her, nearly forgetting she was there in the room with them. 


  “I uh, can send one with Blaise. You can have it by tonight.” He told her and Ginny smiled. 


  “Wow Malfoy. Such a gentleman. I can see why Hermione won’t shut up about you.” Ginny clearly exaggerated but Malfoy didn’t know that. She shot him a wink before leaving the room, Hermione shooting daggers at her head. 


  Once she turned around, Malfoy was biting his cheek, eyebrows high on his forehead. 


  “She’s— she’s just kidding. I— I don’t talk about you. I mean I haven’t, I haven’t said anything about you or— mentioned, um, anything.” She stuttered over her words, her eyes falling shut in hopes that when she reopened them he would be gone and she could die of embarrassment in peace. 


  She heard Draco take a step forward and she slowly opened her eyes to see a dark expression on his face. It matched the one she had seen last weekend in the Cherry Pit, and it made her insides knot up. 


  “I don’t mind if you do.” He told her, a teasing yet deep tone around his words. Hermione’s eyes widened a fraction bigger. She had to grab onto the bottle of alcohol tighter, fearing it would slip through her sweaty hands. 


  There was a strong silence between them. Draco let his eyes fall over her body before giving her a questioning look. 


  “Any plans this evening?” He asked and Hermione felt herself blush again. 


  “N-no. Ginny is going out with Blaise. I was going to stay in and do some research for work.” She explained, watching as he took another step to her, his stormy eyes holding her body in place. 


  “Sounds boring.” He said and she could only give a small shrug. “Would you be up to 
  
    unwind 
  
  a bit tonight?” 


  His words made her center clench and she hated herself for glancing down at his pouty lips. Her mind was screaming no but the words that came out were, “What did you have in mind?”


  Her voice came out as a breathy pant, she mentally cursed herself for being so obvious. The room’s temperature seemed to have increased ten degrees in five seconds. Everything about the interaction felt boiling.


  Draco smiled and took another step forward. 


  “Do you trust me to continue our little exploration into relaxing?” He asked, his voice sounded like a rumble in his throat. 


  Hermione’s head tilted back as she looked up to him. She sucked her bottom lip into her mouth and tried not to think of the way it felt when he hummed into her cunt last week before making her come. Her eyes almost watered at the memory, her body was surely red. 


  “Why not?” She almost whispered. 


  Draco brought a hand up to her face, stringing a curl around a single finger. Her eyes watched the pale finger coil within her hair. The lengthy brown hair tickled his forearm, it was soft, like she just washed it. 


  “I’ll pick you up around seven thirty tonight. Wear something comfortable.” He told her, his eyes focused on the different shades of brown swirling in her hair. 


  “Okay.” She said, not thinking of anything else to say when he was standing so close to her. 


  Draco pulled his hand down to stretch the curl straight, his knuckles grazed down over her breast and she let out a small gasp. He released the curl, letting the hair bounce back into place then stepped away. 


  “See you Granger.” He called over his shoulder with a smirk then left her apartment.


  Hermione shook her head, trying to clear her mind to understand what she just agreed to. She heard Ginny’s feet patter into the room and she plopped down on the couch, giving Hermione a cheeky grin. She opened her mouth to speak but Hermione cut her off, hiding a smirk. 


  “Shut up Ginny.” She said which made the redhead throw her head back and laugh. 



  Draco arrived exactly five minutes before seven thirty, wearing the same attire as she saw him in earlier. 


  He stepped into her flat and shut the door. “We can apparate from here.” He told her, eyes trailing over the pair of loose denim shorts she wore, exposing a good amount of her legs. 


  “Where are we going?” She questioned and he held out his hand. She slowly took it, wondering why his hand was actually warm instead of it’s usual cool temperature. Looking up at him, waiting for a response, Hermione felt his arm pull her closer into his side. 


  He looked down at her and said, “Paris.” before disappearing from her living room. 


  They landed in what appeared to be another living room. It was large, filled with many paintings and furniture. There was a balcony door that was left open, brightening the room with natural light. Looking around, Hermione thought it was extremely luxurious. 


  “It’s my villa. I own another club in Paris and need a place to stay when business is pressing.” He told her as her eyes wandered over the room. 


  “You have another club?” She asked, eyes finally landing back to his. 


  “Mhm. I own three. One in London, one here obviously and one more in Rio. I’m looking to open one more in Barcelona.” 


  Hermione was impressed. She had no idea he owned his own clubs and seemingly was a very hands on entrepreneur.


  “So, that’s what we’re doing tonight?” She asked and Draco nodded.


  “But first there’s a few places we need to stop .” 


  Hermione gave him a look and Draco only nodded to the door, silently asking her to follow. 


  Once they left his villa, Draco led them down a few streets where multiple small boutiques and stores were. Most of them were already closed since it was later in the evening and the sun was just setting, but Draco opened the door to one that still had the lights on. 


  The shoppe had one worker in it, an older lady with striking black hair and a red middle length dress hugging her body. Draco greeted her in flawless French, called her Marie and gestured to Hermione while they conversed. The woman, Marie, smiled and nodded, giving her response and motioning Hermione to follow. 


  “Go on. I’ll be right back, I have to pick up something next door.” Draco encouraged and Hermione hesitantly nodded. She had no idea what he was up to, but if shopping was what he wanted, she was more than okay with obliging him. 


  Marie led her to another room, dresses and gowns neatly hanging on the hanging racks. Some were organized by color, other sections by length. Hermione couldn’t help but stare in awe at the gorgeous fabrics, all of them certainly out of her price range.


  She was brought to a changing room, adorned by high, blue velvet curtains on golden rods. Three wall sized mirrors stood at the end of the curtains. The woman pulled one back and gestured her inside. Three dresses were already hanging up. The woman handed Hermione the first one, a red dress. 


  “Try them all. Pick two.” Marie said, her french accent thick and unsure but Hermione nodded excitedly, explaining she understood, and took the dress. 


  The woman closed the curtain and Hermione finally allowed herself to inspect the dress. The red one in her hands was a thick fabric, it would most likely hug her body and end mid thigh. The v shaped neckline would sink deep to the middle of her chest. She sucked in a breath, hanging the dress back up and began to remove her clothes. 


  It had taken Hermione more than a few minutes to reveal herself to the woman, who kept asking if everything was alright in a very timid voice. She realized the dress was meant to be worn braless, and she had to shove the dress to the middle of her stomach, shuck her bra off, and then put it back on before she stepped out of the dressing room. 


  Marie took her hand and led her to the mirror, smiling brightly at Hermione. 


  “Do you like it?” 


  Hermione was breathless. The deep red wasn’t noisy or loud, it was sensual and thrilling. There was a small slit on the left side exposing more of her creamy thigh, and the neckline she thought would be too deep and revealing actually looked modestly sexy on her. She stared at her body, wondering how she could have transformed into something so beautiful by just putting on one dress. 


  “I love it. It’s—“ 


  She was led back to the dressing room, Marie kept saying ‘next one, next one’ and closed the curtain before Hermione could admire herself once more. Huffing out a breath, she moved on to ivory, sweetheart strapless number. The material ended at her shins, she didn’t think the style was exactly her taste. Throwing the curtains back, Hermione moved in front of the mirrors and raised up on her tiptoes, turning to her side to inspect her appearance. 


  She thought it was lovely, but it did not suit her form. Sinking back into the changing room, her next option looked like a black, skin tight bodice dress. The bodice was lacy, see through-material, merging into a bra that thankfully wasn’t see-through. Hermione tugged on the dress, careful with the fragile material. The skirt of the dress was completely black, kissing her thighs. 


  Once she stepped in front of the mirror, Hermione couldn’t stop looking at her body. The black dress made her feel daunting and scandalous. The bra of the dress pushed her smaller breasts up, giving her more dimension than what she was used to. 


  “Beautiful.” Marie commented, her older eyes admiring Hermione’s form. 


  She agreed and told her the black and red would be her two picks. The bell of the shoppe rang and Hermione scattered back into the dressing room, not wanting Draco to see her. Marie packed up the dresses in a large box, handing it to Draco when he finally found them in the back room. Hermione stepped away from the long curtains, giving him a questioning look when she saw he carried his own black bag. 


  “What did you buy?” She questioned. He stepped forward and took the large box from her struggling hands, holding them easily under his long arm. His eyes suddenly lit up.


  “It’s a secret.” 


  “I don’t like the sound of that.” Hermione said, half joking but also half extremely serious. 


  Draco grinned and looked at Marie. They spoke briefly, smiled politely and Marie shot Hermione a knowing look while giving Draco a wink. 
  
    What was that?
  


  Once they finished, Draco nodded away from Marie, leading them to the exit. 


  “But I have to pay.” Hermione told him, turning her body to give Marie a thankful wave. She was already falling behind fromDraco’s long strides, he didn’t slow down. 


  “No need. It’s taken care of.” He held the door open for her, trying to stifle a chuckle when she looked all around her, expecting someone to stop her for walking out of the store. 


  “What do you mean?” She stepped outside, the streets were lit up and the warmth of the summer day was still present in the air. 


  “It’s taken care of. Already paid for it.” Draco explained, too nonchalant for her liking. 


  “Already paid? Wait, will you slow down?” She scurried into a jog, coming up to his side. “Why—I need to pay you back.” 


  “You will not.” He sternly responded. Her brow furrowed in annoyance and Draco let out a very unlike him snort when he saw her pouting face. “Granger look; I invited you out, I would never expect you to pay for anything, your money means nothing to me when I literally have more galleons than I know what to do with sometimes. Just…trust me yeah? That was the theme for tonight?” 


  Hermione wanted to argue with his logic and explain that it was the principle that mattered to her. She looked at his side profile, he peered over at her from the corner of his eyes and rose the brow facing her. After another moment of contemplation, she spoke. 


  “Fine. Just this one time.” She crossed her arms and continued to try and catch up to his pace. His tall figure pushed him at least two strides ahead of her. 


  “Sure Granger. Whatever you say.” He told her but she knew he was just saying it to get her to shut up. She rolled her eyes. 


  “Will you slow down? Merlin, why do you walk so fast?” She grumbled, making him laugh. 


  “I don’t. You’re just short.” He explained but slowed down regardless. Hermione voiced her appreciation and the two finished their walk back to the villa in a comfortable silence. 


  Draco set the boxes down on a glass table along with his own bag. Hermione watched as he checked the time, a slow grin spreading over his face. 


  “We have an hour and a half before we need to leave. Have you eaten?” He asked. Hermione felt her face morph. 


  “Er no. I—I thought we were—“ She was slightly embarrassed to say out loud that she assumed Draco and her were going to have dinner together tonight. He had asked her to meet him around a normal dinner date time, he had taken her dress shopping for something she assumed she’d wear tonight. Voicing it out loud though after he asked made her feel like her assumptions had been wrong. 


  “No problem.” He cut her off. She let out a relieved breath. ”Go shower, take as long as you need. I’ll have some food waiting. The master bedroom is right through those doors with a connected bathroom. It should have everything you need.” 


  Hermione eyed the double white doors and glanced back at Draco. He moved to pick up her dresses in the box and the mysterious bag, heading in the opposite direction. 


  “O-okay. But what about—“ She started, wondering why he was taking her new clothes with him. 


  “Go. Before you run out of time.” Draco called over his shoulder, not waiting for Hermione to ask more questions before he slipped into his own room. 


  Huffing out loud, Hermione walked over to the doors and swung them open. The room was decorated in white and gold, leafy patterned wall paper covered the room, a large king sized bed with four posters covered in sheer material hanging over it and a balcony that overlooked the now glowing city. Even if she blindly agreed to do…whatever it was her and Malfoy were doing, she appreciated the opportunity to visit her favorite city. 


  The bathroom held two sinks, a mirror the length of the wall and a glass door shower with a built in stone sitting spot that could have fit five people. She stood in awe for a moment before releasing a chuckle. Gods of course his villa would include a bathroom bigger than her own room. 


  She took a 45 minute shower, that included ten minutes of her trying to burn off her nerves in the high pressure water system. She shaved, trying to tell herself it was because she was prickly, but the small little devil in the back of her head laughed and told her it was because she was secretly hoping for another interaction with the tall, tattooed blonde Slytherin. 


  There was a plush robe and slippers waiting on her bed after she left the bathroom. Her wet ringlets were dripping onto the floor, a small shiver floating up her back from the night’s breeze. Quickly throwing the towel into her head and wrapping the soft robe around her body, she cracked open the door of the bedroom. 


  Half her head peered out from the door, she saw him immediately. There he was, sitting at the table with plates of food that looked like takeaway from some local restaurant. He was dressed in a similar robe, minus the towel on his head. Looking down at her own robe, she figured it was enough coverage to make her appearance known to him. 


  Her slippers slid across the floor, but Malfoy heard the soft shut of the doors. His head followed the noise, smirking when he saw her head wrapped up in a towel that reminded him of an ice cream cone. She didn’t meet his eyes but could tell her was following her movements, she silently sat down next to him. 


  “Do something different with your hair? I have to say I think I prefer it. Looks much more manageable.” He commented. 


  “Shut it.” She responded instantly, a smile poking out of her lips. He chuckled and handed her a ceramic bowl, filled with what looked to be beef stew. 


  “Enjoy your shower?” He changed the subject, eyeing the way she swirled her baguette in the stew. 


  “Mhm. It’s massive. Everything is beautiful including the bedroom and the views.” She still hadn’t looked at him, attempting to name all the vegetables in the stew seemed much more fascinating than looking at him in a robe while a few of his blonde locks were sticking to his neck. 


  “That’s typically my room. When I visit, that is.” Draco sipped his water and enjoyed the way Hermione harshly swallowed her bread. 


  “Mm.” She responded, unsure of why it was necessary to reveal that small bit of info to her. “Do you come to Paris often then?” 


  Draco slid the sleeves of his bathrobe up to his elbows, giving Hermione access to view the permanent patterns she had grown a strange fondness for. Her eyes moved up his thick forearms, following a noticeable vein that began at his middle finger until it disappeared into his elbow under the fuzzy robe once more. 


  “More recently. Paris and London are the newest clubs so they need my attention a bit more.” He told her while she ate more of her meal. Gray eyes finding a drop of broth sliding down her lips especially interesting. 


  “I still think it’s a little funny you own and run clubs.” She told him honestly while dabbing her lips with a napkin. 


  “Oh yeah? Why’s that?” He questioned back, more than curious to hear her reasoning. 


  “I figured you’d do some work within your family, or maybe get your potions mastery, or…I don’t know really.” Her voice became quiet, her eyes averted his amused face. 


  “Think about me often?” He teased. 


  “No. I was just,” She huffed and rolled her eyes, “making observations.” 


  Draco chuckled and pushed his plate away from him, giving him the space to place his elbows on the table and rub his face with one hand. He noticed the way her cheeks began to blush, his pride grew with every darkening shade.


  “Well one was correct. I am a potions master.”


  The admission made her eyes snap up, something she was not expecting to hear at all. 


  “When did you complete that?” 


  Draco gave her a timid smile before stabbing some cheesy potatoes. He bobbed his head from side to side, racking his brain for an exact time frame. 


  “Maybe four years ago.” 


  “Then…why aren’t you doing anything with it?” She finished her soup and Draco rose to collect her bowl. When he stood up, the ties on his robe loosened, showing more of his chest. She tried to look away as quickly as possible, but the hard lines and smooth pale skin made her turn to catch a peak before he turned away. 


  “I am. How do you think I’ve managed to create the most diverse and innovative drink menu in all of Wizarding UK?” Draco arrogantly asked. Hermione’s mouth opened when she thought of his explanation. 


  “I—I never thought anyone would use it like that.” 


  “No one has, that’s why my clubs are so popular. No one has even thought it would be possible to combine potions into alcoholic beverages. I’m able to sell my drinks at higher prices because there is literally no one else doing what I’m doing.” Draco spoke with admiration for his own work, rightfully so. Instead of being deterred by the constant job rejections from a potions teacher or an apothecary, Draco ran with his ideas and made a fortune. Hermione felt herself smile and truly found it remarkable how successful he was. 


  “You’re like Willy Wonka.” She told him, he instantly frowned. 


  “Who?” 


  “It’s a character from this muggle book and movie. He’s a man who owns a chocolate factory and he’s the best chocolate maker in the world. He has all different sorts of wacky candies and inventions to make his products and there’s other companies looking to steal his ideas and then he brings…sorry it’s bizarre. Nevermind.” Hermione shook her head when she noticed Draco was giving her a blank look as she rambled. There was no reason why he wanted to hear anything about the children’s story, but she thought the comparison was funny. 


  “No it’s fine. Sorry I don’t really understand the similarities between me and a…chocolate maker?” He told her, his face still looking blank but confusion popping out onto his features. His brows came together on his head, failing to grasp at muggle culture and Hermione held in a giggle. 


  “It’s one of those things you’d have to see for yourself. I loved the story as a kid.” 


  “Well, maybe one day I’ll look into this chocolate maker, see what he’s all about.” 


  Hermione bit her lip and nodded. Of course she doubted he ever really would look into it, but she thought it was endearing to think of Malfoy reading the story. It didn’t match his personality and she found it entirely hilarious. 


  “So. I’m going to change. You should get your hair and makeup in order or whatever it is you need to do to feel comfortable. Once you’re done let me know and I’ll deliver your outfit.” He explained and she gave him a look. 


  “Why can’t I just have my dresses now? I know which one I want to wear.” Hermione crossed her arms over her stomach and raised her brow at him. Draco leaned his knuckles against the countertop and sent her a scarily handsome grin. 


  “You’re not wearing those dresses tonight.” He stated. 


  “What am I wearing then?” She could feel her nerves surface, his joyous expression meant he was up to no good. 


  “Something.” 


  Ambiguity was not something she appreciated, especially when it came to Malfoy. Hermione twisted in the chair, her leg falling out of the robe and Draco’s eyes instantly attached to the tanned skin on her calf. He licked his lips and she had to readjust the robe. The heat flooding in her body contrasted the shivers his look caused her. 


  “That’s hardly an answer.” 


  “Well I hardly think it matters.” He retorted, pushing his body away from the counter and walking to the opposite side of her, pushing the doors to her…
  
    his…
  
  bedroom. “Come on. Go finish getting ready.” 


  She didn’t move. Close to laughing at how his antics mirrored those of a parent telling a child what to do. “No. Show me what I’m 
  
    allowed 
  
  to wear since you’re being all…mysterious and—and cryptic.” 


  Draco rolled his eyes and let his hand fall to the side. “Granger, my club has a dress code. I personally picked out your attire so you have nothing to worry about. Just 
  
    trust 
  
  me.” He pleased, emphasizing the word ‘trust’ purposefully so she’d remember what tonight was all about. She looked at his patient face for a few seconds before eventually grumbling something about how ridiculous he was under her breath and trudging to her room. 


  “Give me twenty minutes.” She shut the door and quickly scampered into the bathroom. Gods she wished Ginny was here to help with makeup. The witch had become well versed in hair charms to make her hair cooperate in whatever fashion she wanted to wear it, but makeup was harder for her. After three attempts, Hermione let out a loud groan and nearly threw her wand out the window in frustration. Taking one deep breath, she closed her eyes and willed herself to focus harder than she had in her first year exams. It was silly, and unlike her to care so much about how her makeup was going to look for the night. But her body regretfully exploded in happiness when she got the charm right.


  Her hair flowed over her shoulders in straighter, looser waves. Her lashes looked longer and flared out intensely at the edges and the shadow over the lids made the brown of her eyes darker, fiercer. Her lips remained a soft pink, matching the shade of her cheeks. Hermione sent herself a smile and heard Malfoy’s knocks at her door. 


  “Granger, you ready?” 


  She pulled the doors open with both hands, a gasp catching and dying in her throat while she looked at Malfoy’s own attire. A light, slate blue suit fitted his physique perfectly, accentuating his wide shoulders and exposing the muscles in his legs. Gods he was fit, and tall and unfairly attractive. His blonde hair looked impossibly whiter with the light shade but they meshed together well. His eyes were bright when she finally met them, too in her own head about checking him out and now about her own appearance to notice his ears were turning red. 


  He swallowed the dryness down in his throat, words momentarily lost as he now wondered if tonight, or rather she, would be the end of him. Hermione raised her brows and gestured her hands at the bag he was holding. 


  “Is that my secret outfit?” She moved her hand to take it from his but he pulled it farther out of reach. She looked at him incredulously. “Seriously? I’m the one wearing it and I still can’t know?” 


  “Before I show you, I need you to promise me that you trust me.” His head tilted down looking at the pinkness of her full lips and trying not to shudder in front of her when he remembered the way it felt to run his tongue over those same lips just a week ago. It was truly all he thought about and he was hoping for another opportunity tonight if allowed one. 


  Hermione raised an eyebrow at him, worry coming over her face. “Should I not?” She asked him, unsure of why he was being so serious about an outfit and the night. 


  “No you should. I just want to know you do. And if you do, that means that you’re not going to try an escape like last week.” Draco ran his tongue over the smoothness of his teeth and Hermione flushed, not certain if he was referring to the bet he won or the way she ran out of his office after he brought her to a mind blowing oral orgasm. 


  “I—“ she blinked at him, her words felt easy when she spoke, “I trust you.” 


  Hermione watched his jaw clench once before he smiled. And it wasn’t a sort of mischievous or cunning smile. It felt oddly genuine, like her words were appreciated or taken as a compliment. 


  “Brilliant.” 


  Draco stepped into her room and placed the bag on her bed. He looked down at her, eyes darkening in a way that made her stomach flip. “Ready?” He questioned and she nodded once. They walked over to the bed and he first unpacked a box that she guessed were her shoes. Draco glanced at her from the corner of his eyes, an anxious breath releasing from his chest. 


  Hermione’s jaw fell open and her eyes grew two times larger. She watched him lay out the ‘outfit,’ reaching into the bag to pull out more items. He was calm beside her, even though he could tell she was having a silent freak out at the grand revelation. 


  “Well?” He hesitantly asked. 


  A small shriek fell out of her mouth, so quick it almost didn’t sound like a human noise.


  “No fucking way.”

  “No fucking way.”


  Hermione still had her mouth open. She couldn’t believe what he laid out in front of her. This had to be a joke, one universal joke he was playing on her just to get a ridiculous reaction. Because there’s no way Malfoy expected her to wear something like 
  
    that 
  
  out in public. There was barely a part of her that would wear that in the comfort of her own home. She folded her arms over her body and continued to gawk at the clothing, or lack thereof. 


  “You can’t honestly expect me to wear that Malfoy!” She cried, looking up at his face seeing a very relaxed face. 


  “I told you there’s a dress code.” He shrugged, biting that pretty rosy colored lip of his. Hermione wanted to take the clothes and throw them in his face. 


  “What kind of club are you running? A strip club? Are you a pimp on the side?” She fired the questions at him, still in disbelief that this is what she agreed to do. Draco laughed heartily at the outburst. 


  “It’s lingerie specific. All women, including servers, wear lingerie. All men, including servers, have to wear suits.” He explained and Hermione felt mortified at the thought of walking into a club he owned surrounded by other women all wearing lingerie. It was humiliating and demeaning. Why should men wear suits and women wear lingerie? 


  “Before you go into a tirade at how disrespectful it is to women about the dress code, I should tell you that there seems to be a preference for that sort of…dress kink here in Paris. People love it.” He explained. 


  The lingerie Draco had chosen was a baby pink strapless corset, decorated in lace with what appeared to be roses. The knickers, thankfully not a thong, were sheer lace, matching the roses on the corset. And of course, there were garters and delicate stockings. Her eyebrows were pushed together on her forehead and she felt her cheek spasm in a grimace. She shook her head. 


  “Malfoy. No—just no.” She turned around and headed back into the bathroom, looking to collect the clothes she came in. 


  “Granger—“ 


  “I can’t be dressed up like that around men! In public! I’d look like a-a…” She was freaking out but thankfully held back, not wanting to offend Malfoy and the way he ran his business. “I’m sorry,” she sighed, “I can’t do that.” 


  Draco had followed her frantic movements, watching her shake her head and throw her hands around in a most animated way while she collected her clothes. When she turned to make an exit from the bathroom, he stopped in the doorway, keeping her trapped and forcing her to look at him. 


  “Granger, you promised,” He began, his tone entirely serious. 


  “Yes, but I—“ 


  “But nothing. You said you trusted me, so do it. I’m not taking you to a back alley speakeasy, this is 
  
    my 
  
  establishment. I think you’d find it classy and exhilarating, like everyone else who attends the club.”


  Hermione found it hard to listen to his voice when his body towered over hers in the bloody suit that made blood rush to her ears. His voice sounded soothing when he spoke in such a gentle way, but she still wasn’t sure about going. 


  “I believe you but I just can’t do it.” Her head tilted down and she shut her eyes. “That’s…That’s not me and I…I can’t.” She was too embarrassed to admit that being in the company of other barely dressed witches made her insecurities fill to the brim. The unfamiliarity of wearing lingerie, feeling in touch with a woman’s natural sexiness and allure was too intimidating. She could handle a dress, but not something as bold as what Draco was suggesting. Hermione knew she’d be surrounded by women who were free spirited and confident, comfortable in showing off their bodies. She couldn’t do that, she wasn’t that, but most importantly, she didn’t 
  
    believe 
  
  she was any of that. 


  “Hermione,” Draco began, his voice low and testing. The way his lips sounded so soft around the letters of her name made her worried eyes meet his. It sounded like a song, a comforting, reassuring lullaby. 


  “You keep saying you don’t do this, or you can’t do that, but you keep proving yourself wrong. I don’t think this time would be any different.” He took a step forward, she instinctively took one backwards. He made no move to touch her, keeping a small invisible border between them as he took another step. 


  “You’re allowed to be something that’s not normally you, that’s not normally expected of you.” He told her and she thought it strangely sounded like he was giving her permission to act on her other curiosities. 


  “You can get drunk and dance obscenely with a stranger if that makes you feel good.” His forward movements caused them to pause in front of the sinks. She could see their reflection in the corner of her eye, his skyscraper body hovering over hers. 


  She felt her legs go weak when he smirked at her and let his eyes trail over her body still concealed in the bathroom robe. His gaze made her feel like she was completely naked and vulnerable to him, it was powerful.


  “You can go out in lingerie and love the way you feel.” He stepped behind her, an invisible wall still between them but his body was close enough she could feel the heat of his breath hit the top of her head. Her cheek met the top of her shoulder, eyes focused on the pale hands that remained at his sides.


  “You’re allowed to like feeling sexy, and like that strangers in a random club in Paris find you sexy.” His voice made her shiver. Her eyelids shut for only a second to revel in the smooth sound of his voice. She felt cool fingertips angle her jaw straight forward, her eyes opened at the sensitive touch and focused on his dark eyes in the mirror. He smirked again, and 
  
    gods, 
  
  he could’ve asked her to do anything in that moment and she probably would’ve agreed. 


  His right arm lifted, she watched the tips of his fingers skim over her hand and up the length of her arm. 


  “You’re allowed to like the touch of a stranger, even if you think you shouldn’t.” 


  She gasped when his fingertips brushed over her neck. Her heart was fluttering in her chest so violently she was positive he could see the movement through her robe. The pads of his fingers moved downwards over her shoulder blades and to her sides. The material of the robe was too thick, it made her irritated that she couldn’t feel more of his touch, more of 
  
    him. 
  
   


  "Wouldn't you like that?" His slender hand came to the front of the robe, lightly pulling one side back to reveal her bare thigh to his touch. The tips of his fingers left an icy path all over her soft skin, branding her with his featherlike precision, she shuddered. "Wouldn't you like to stop worrying and just…indulge in the things you want?" 


  His question sounded so reasonable, his deep angelic voice coaxing her to agree quickly. His fingertips barely brushed over her thigh, trailing wavy, obscure lines over the front and over to her upper thigh, then to the side. Her mouth parted when his eyes flickered up to hers in an instant, his movements stopping. 


  “Would you like that Hermione?” He asked again. 


  “
  
    Yes.
  
  ” Her voice was barely above a whisper, but he heard her and smiled. His fingers restarted their delicate motions and she almost thanked him out loud for it.


  “So how about you get dressed, we check out my club and let’s say, after thirty minutes, if you don’t like it we’ll leave. Sound okay?” 


  Hermione nodded and swallowed. His voice was too alluring to say no and his offer was something that she could work with, it was only thirty minutes. Draco’s eyes met hers, she could see his blown pupils, the heated stare sent flames to her center. He left her in the bathroom, flushed and somersaults rolling through her stomach. 


  Taking a deep breath, Hermione bravely returned to the bedroom to face the baby pink doom that awaited her. She picked up the corset and held it in front of her face. It was rather pretty. Tilting her head back, she half sighed and half groaned. Draco fucking Malfoy and his hypnotic voice. 


  After a few minutes of struggling with the buttons on the corset and trying not to scream when she couldn’t get the small buckled strap on the white heels, she was finally dressed. The heels clacked against the marble floor of the bathroom, her head almost exploding when she saw herself. 


  The corset made her look curvy, pulled her waist in and brought her breasts up. Turning around to see the back, she realized the panties were a lot more cheeky than she originally anticipated, but she thought it made her look…good. Hermione blushed when she remembered that Draco chose this outfit for her, because he had full intentions of seeing her in this. The thought was slightly unsettling but it lit her pulse on fire. 


  Taking one last breath, Hermione grabbed the coat Malfoy had left her and tugged it on. She swung the doors open and stepped out into the main room, a waiting Malfoy standing on the balcony with a cigarette between his lips. He heard the door and stood up, taking one last pull before throwing the butt to the ground. 


  He fit his hands in his pockets and smirked while walking to her. His eyes falling over the heels and her lacy calves. She bit the inside of her cheek, finding the dirt under her nails to be much more fascinating than his features. 


  “Ready?” He asked, stopping only a foot away from her. 


  “Thirty minutes only.” She warned and he quirked a knowing brow. 


  “Thirty minutes and we see how you feel.” He corrected and she rolled her eyes. 


  “It’ll most likely be thirty minutes. Don’t get your hopes up.” Hermione played with the smooth tips of her hair, finding the silkiness to be a calming sensation. 


  “I’ve already got my hopes up, you want to know why Granger?” Malfoy was goading her, she knew it, but the way his lips curled to form the tiniest of dimples in his cheek forced her to respond. 


  “Why?” She asked him, head tilting upwards to meet his playful eyes. 


  “Because I’ve learned you’re full of surprises.” 


  She had half a mind to smack his arm, but instead, she took his hand when he offered it to her. As soon as they touched, he disapparated them from his villa and onto a dark block. It was quiet, only two other people on the street plus one man standing in front of a red wooden door. The sign above shined in white, twinkling lights and it read in French but Hermione assumed what it said. 


  Draco walked them over to the man who shook his hand with a very polite smile. He was burly, the same height as Draco, but much more muscular. Security for the club seemed extensive since it was so calm for the night. 


  “Bonsoir Monsieur. Le club est à pleine capacité. Amusez-vous bien.” The security man opened the door, revealing a dark, empty hallway. She felt Draco’s hand on her back to encourage her forward, the bodyguard offered his hand to help her up the stone stairs. 


  Once she placed both feet on the ground, the hallway lit up in lights, one after the other like a domino effect. The walls and ceilings were mirrors, and the length of the hallway resembled a runway. The door shut behind them, echoing into the emptiness. Draco still had his hand on her back, the comforting touch was the only thing that kept her breathing at a normal place. 


  “Shall we?” Draco said, and she dazedly allowed him to push her body forward, the sound of her heels filling the empty runway.


  At the end of the hallway was just another mirror that connected to the walls and ceiling. They came face to face with their appearance. Hermione could make out the rosiness of her cheeks and saw Draco’s heavy stare capture hers. 


  “Comment faire un nœud avec une tige de cerise?”  Draco spoke, the way his tongue rolled over the words made Hermione bite her lips. She tried to tell herself to remember what he just said and look it up later. Whatever the words, they sounded divine coming from his lips. 


  Suddenly, the mirror became transparent, looking like a foggy cloud, and she could make out moving figures behind the apparition. Draco was the first to step through the threshold, his body almost shielding her from the scene in front of her as he pulled her through. As soon as the fog cleared, she gasped. 


  The room was dimly lit, creating a hazy glow that made the atmosphere timeless. The floor was sunken in, stairs leading down to the main floor in a perfect square. The main floor faced a stage, the back wall a massive mirror. There were tables and chaise lounge chairs spaced out evenly, only one open section left and Hermione could guess who those were for. 


  The area around the stairs branched off to create a thick looking ledge with four sections in each corner and hallways in between all of them. Hermione could see thick fabric winding down from the ceiling, women twirling and twisting into the fabric as the men sat around the smaller stages and watched in awe. They were acrobats, performing for the men. Each stage had at least two girls performing, one of the larger of the stages had three people, one of the performers being a man. 


  Her mouth was permanently hung open, there was too much in front of her to take in at once. What seemed to be the most surprising factor is that there was a slightly even balance between men and women who attended the club. The men were in suits as Draco said, and the women were dressed in lingerie, only the workers wore black or white it seemed. She noted that every woman was wearing a feather boa that was either red, black or white. Every man had a boutonnière that was again either red, black or white. 


  Hermione was amazed and slightly intimidated. This seemed like a burlesque, higher end…show club. Every worker looked stunning and had their own glow of attractiveness around them. The people that attended all seemed confident, not caring they were exposing their bodies. In fact, everyone seemed to be embracing it.


  Before she could ask any questions or voice her hesitations Draco was at a small booth, appearing to be a coat check. Her stomach fell into the floor when she realized she would soon have to remove her coat, exposing her scantily clad body to the attendees in the club, and, to Draco. 


  “Deux pour blanc.” He asked the woman, and she disappeared from view. Hermione took a step closer to his side. 


  “What did you ask her?” 


  Draco looked at Hermione, biting his lip to conceal his smirk. He leaned up against the counter, stuffing one hand into his pant pocket. Even leaning he was still a half foot taller than him, plus she was in heels. His height was astounding and somewhat infuriating. She hated how she had to look up at him, wishing she was closer to have a better look into the flecks of blue in his eyes. 


  “I asked for our colors.” 


  “Colors? What does that mean?” 


  She watched as Draco removed his silver quellazaire from his back pocket, taking a cigarette and bringing it between his full lips. It loosely hung as he lit it, the smoke making her choke back a cough. 


  “At ‘La Fosse aux Cerises’ there are colors assigned to each attendee based on what they're looking for from the club.” He explained and came to stand directly by her side, bending slightly so she could follow his raised pointed finger and hear his low voice. “The black flowers and boas are for people who are single. Workers can touch them, interact with them and other people know they can approach them.” 


  Hermione nodded, feeling more relaxed and finding Draco more…admirable, for instilling a system to consider people’s comfort levels. He removed the cigarette from his lips and pointed to a crowd who were primarily wearing red boas and flowers, swaying to the movements of the acrobat on their current stage. 


  “Red is multiples.” Hermione shivered, his breath tickled her ear and the words seemed to tighten the muscles in her lower region. “It’s for swingers or single people looking for multiple partners, that sort of thing.” 


  Her lips felt dry as her eyes scanned the entirety of the club. Over half the patrons were wearing red and she wondered why so many people were interested in a ménage à trois, or more. “Do—do people prefer that?” 


  Eyes were stuck on the friendly crowd, watching men and women share longing touches, kiss each other openly and sprawl out over each other all while focusing on the entertainment in front of them. The coat checker came back, handing Draco a white boa and a white carnation. 


  “Seems most do here.” He explained while pinning the flower close to the top of his tie, matching the other men in the room. Her eyes moved to the extended hallways, watching as multiple people walked off with a worker. 


  “And what are those? Where do the hallways lead?” She asked. 


  Draco looked over his shoulder to catch her line of view, finally situating the flower in its proper place, and turned back to Hermione to give her a wicked smile. “Private rooms for private shows.” 


  Her eyes flickered back to his, the gray in his eyes looked too teasing to be serious. “No, honestly.” 


  Draco grabbed the white boa in his hand and took a step towards her, the features of her face instantly formed into worry and small bits of confusion. His eyes darkened, totally focused on the way her lips parted when he was only inches away from her. 


  “Honestly.” He told her, wrapping the boa around her shoulders and letting his hands fall down the feathers, staying close to her lower stomach. They held each other’s eye contact, blood rushing to Hermione’s ears as Draco licked his teeth, eyes flashing down her body. 


  “Time for this to go.” He tugged on the coat and Hermione looked down and frowned. Stretching out on to her tippy toes in the heels, she looked past his shoulders and back into the crowd, viewing the woman who had no problem looking outrageously attractive. Her heart was wildly beating in her chest, insecurity seeping through her bones and weighing her down. 


  Cool hands found her heating cheeks, her body sat back down to her normal height and her wary hazelnut eyes found the smokiness of his. 


  “Hey, don’t worry about the other women or the men. I’ll lead us to the table, you’ll be right by my side and no one will bother us. I promise.” His breath smelled harshly of menthol and she wanted to ask if there were any cherries for him to snack on. The sweet scent had become something she expected of him and now, she directly attributed cherries to him. 


  Hermione took a deep breath and let it blow past her lips, vibrating through her mouth. His hands felt incredibly soft, the tips of his large palm resting comfortably on the side of her neck. She relaxed in his hold and absolutely hated that she was going to do this. 


  “You have to turn around.” She told him and his head jerked back, a silly expression coming over his features. One blonde brow shot up on his forehead. 


  “You can’t be serious. I’m going to see you no matter what—“ 


  “I know, I know, but just…turn around while I…undress. It’ll make me feel better.” Her cheeks flushed again and she took a step backwards out of his hold. She didn’t remember when he decided they had crossed a point where he could openly touch her in comforting ways. It was appreciated but felt out of place, for him at least. 


  Draco rolled his eyes but complied with her orders, taking a solid drag before disposing of it in a nearby ashtray. Hermione kept her eyes on him, making sure he wouldn’t glance back as she removed her coat and handed it to the worker behind the booth. The feather boa was readjusted to hang loosely over her back and hung through her elbows. The air hit her exposed body, a shiver crawled up her back and winded its way down to her toes. She could do this, she repeatedly told herself, it was only thirty minutes and she was more than capable of surviving thirty minutes with Draco Malfoy in a lingerie club. 


  Walking to Draco’s side, she slid her arm under his, wrapping her hand around his forearm. With the most confidence she could muster, she tilted her head forward and refused to meet his glance. She could feel his eyes boring into her body, but she didn’t give the satisfaction of letting him see her flushed and unsure. She cleared her throat once and shook her head, her wavy hair tickling the skin just above the strapless corset. 


  “Lead the way.” She said, her eyes focused on the center stage below them. 


  Draco was staring, mentally screaming at her to look at him so he could see her face and take her entire beauty in. Her body curved in all the areas he loved, giving him so much to look at but simply not enough to keep him happy. It took every ounce of self restraint to not run his hands down her backside and slap it so hard the entire club could hear it. The garters made his mouth water and he found himself jealous of the delicate lace that wrapped around her thighs. The lace of her knickers hid the best parts but teased him almost painfully. He told himself to buy a gift basket to send to the woman who helped him pick out the outfit in the lingerie boutique. 


  She looked divine, and she was holding on to
  
     his
  
   arm. 


  He could feel his neck break out into a heat, so he looked forward and led them down the stairs as she requested. They approached another security man that opened the velvet rope that blocked off the main center of the club. Draco nodded at the man, and they were soon amongst a large bustling crowd of men and women drinking and smoking, chattering in French and talking it up with the workers of the club. 


  “We’re up here, best seat in the house.” Draco muttered into her ear, politely nodding and smirking at his workers who waved and said hello. Hermione silently nodded and tried to focus on her legs moving. Draco’s arm was definitely keeping her up right in the moment, and she was sure if she looked anywhere but straight ahead, she would have ran away. Her priority was finding their seat and sitting down, so she didn’t have to look at anyone. 


  A black velvet lounge chair that could possibly sit three people was the only open section on the floor. They were situated towards the middle, off center to the right but had a clear view of the stage and mirrors. Hermione’s eyes saw her dimmed reflection and for a second, had forgotten how different she looked in the lingerie. Her eyes glinted in appreciation and she let herself be reminded of Draco’s soothing words from earlier. 
  
    You’re allowed to like feeling sexy. 
  


  Draco suddenly reached to grab her hand and helped her sit down on the soft chair. Their small end table already had a carafe and glasses waiting for them, and of course, a bowl of cherries. Hermione could have rolled her eyes in that moment but she was happy when she saw Draco immediately pop one into his mouth. 


  She sat upright and rigid, ankles crossed and body leaning into the middle of the chair, hands were so tightly clasped together that she began to get that prickly numb feeling in some of her fingers. Draco noticed and leaned over to her while her head was tilted down. 


  “If you don’t relax, you won’t enjoy the show.” He whispered, making her hop in her seat. Draco felt slightly bad, knowing she was out of her element but he didn't think she would be this anxious. Her eyes were wide and the deep lines in her forehead were already beginning to hurt from the strain. 


  Hermione took a deep breath, begging herself to calm down and live in the moment, but she felt uncomfortable and was thinking of ways to politely ask him if they could leave. 


  “Do you want anything? Water, a drink, something to smoke?” He offered and she shook her head, giving him an awkward half laugh. 


  “No. I’m sorry, I’m not the best company for something like this.” She nervously gestured around them and turned her attention back to her toes. She could feel Draco hesitantly move closer to her on the couch, his arm moving to hang over the ledge behind her head. His cologne floated to her nose at the proximity and she found some peace in the dark, oaky scent. 


  “You’re great company. Stop insulting yourself.” He told her and she shut her eyes for a moment, swallowing the lump forming in her throat. Draco eyed the nervous witch, not understanding how she could be so oblivious to the way she outshined every woman in this place. Deciding on a different route, Draco tried to think of something interesting enough that would capture her interest and help distract her racing mind. 


  “Did you know this place was owned by King Louis the sixth? Just before the sixteenth century.” 


  Hermione looked at him for the first time since removing her coat, surprised at the small fun fact he had provided. “No. What for?” 


  Draco smiled and clicked his tongue. “Seems I know a muggle history fact over the most intelligent muggle born witch. How exciting.” He teased making Hermione roll her eyes and bite the inside of her cheek. 


  “That’s only because you own this place, the information available to you puts me at a disadvantage.” She responded, feeling her shoulders loosen. 


  “Doesn’t matter. I still have this bit of knowledge over you. But yes, it was owned by him before he became King and it was said he used it as a gambling and brothel place. Quite scandalous.” Draco mused and Hermione raised her eyebrows. 


  “More scandalous than all this?” She gestured again to their surroundings. 


  “Of course. La Fosse aux Cerises is good, solid, clean fun.” Draco was doing his best to keep his eyes firmly planted on Hermione’s face. This was the most gentlemanly and polite thing he could do, he felt like a fucking saint. 


  “Mhm. You never told me what the white meant, by the way.” She suddenly said, eyes looking down at the white carnation attached to his lapel. 


  The hand hanging over the edge of the couch moved to her exposed back. Hermione instantly straightened when she felt the icy pads of his fingers slide over her skin. She was completely immobile while he touched her. His hands found the soft feathers of her boa, petting them and twirling them in-between in his fingers. 


  “White is for people who are taken or couples who like to come and watch, or be watched.” His voice noticeably dropped an octave as he watched her react to his words. Her tongue barely dipped out over her lips, but his eyes flashed to it the second it happened, like it was magnetizing. 


  “Be watched?” She asked, not understanding the totality of the words. Draco leaned his head down, the new smell of cherries mixing with menthol made her inhale deeply. 


  “Take a look at the couple to the left of us, three tables down.” He motioned with his head behind her and Hermione shifted her body to find the couple in white. A man and a woman who appeared to be in their early forties sat in lounge chair much similar to theirs. The woman was straddling the man, softly running her hands through his hair, smiling down at him with a dazed expression. The man was running his hands over the woman, sliding to her back and finally down to her backside where he palmed harshly moving her into his front. 


  Hermione couldn’t look away even though she knew it was wrong, even though she knew these people shouldn’t be doing this in such a public setting where over a hundred people were mindlessly sitting around them. They had some onlookers, who looked increasingly interested in the couple’s movements and then there were others who paid them no mind, too wrapped up in their own party at the table. 


  “Some people like the thrill of being in public and doing things that are typically done in the dark. There’s exhilaration in having people watch you, knowing that people could get off to you, to your dirty and naughty actions.” His words were hot in her ear, and as she continued to watch the woman grind up against the man, she seemed to understand what he meant. 


  “They show off to other people. Give them a show and say ‘you can look, but you can’t touch.’”


  Hermione let out a ragged exhale and finally tore her eyes away from the couple, moving her body to face back toward Draco. He somehow moved closer to her, their bodies only a hands distance away, their heat radiating off each other. Draco licked his lips and decided to see if he could provoke a bigger reaction out of her again. 


  “Granger, I have to say I’m battling with myself right now.” He admitted, eyes falling to the outlines of her pink mouth and the dip of her cupid’s bow. Hermione felt herself sway forward, maybe a centimeter not more, but Draco noticed and the corner of his mouth tipped up. 


  “What do you mean?” She whispered, almost stuttering out her question. It felt warm in the building and she wanted to ask if she could quickly cast a cooling charm. 


  “I mean that a part of me would love to be the perfect gentleman tonight. I would hold your hand if you let me while we watch the show, enjoy the music and each other’s lively company. I’d bring you back to the villa and plant a very appropriate kiss to your hand before leaving you alone to sleep. But…that’s only a small, small part of me.” He explained, watching her eyes dart back and forth over his face, hanging on every word he spoke. Her eyelashes fluttered against her cheek as she looked up to him. 


  “And what does the other part of you want?” She didn’t recognize her voice. It was roped into a sultry tone that had never come out of her before.  Draco’s hand resumed their path on her back and he held a thoughtful expression on his face while he made her skin rise in excitement. Hermione’s eyes were drawn to the movement of his tongue, gliding over the top of his lip.


  “The other part of me, would like t—“ 


  He didn’t finish, the loud bang of trumpets playing made her jump out of her seat and caused her head to whip to the stage. There were flashes of lights as women and men danced on stage while the lively music played. The attendees cheered and hollered for the performers. A very tall woman dressed in a black lingerie corset with something that resembled a tutu wrapped around her waist stepped onto the stage, the spotlight zoned in on her and she began to sing in French. 


  Hermione was astounded by how beautiful the woman was, she had almost perfect features and long strawberry blonde hair that warped into beautiful curls down her back. The crowd cheered the hardest for her and Hermione sat and listened as the dancers began to move in a choreographed fashion, all in a very provocative way. 


  The first song ended, everyone applauded. The next tune rang out that seemed more upbeat and jazzy. Hermione was faintly aware that Draco hadn’t moved away after their little conversation. She could feel his arm still hovering right beside her back, his side almost touching hers. She was semi-thankful the performance interrupted him, she wasn’t sure what she or he would have done if he finished his seemingly raunchy sentence. 


  So she sat in silence, different acts sang and danced as the very seductive redhead singer wrapped herself into the hanging fabric and gave an aerial performance too. After some time, the redhead began to talk to the crowd, eliciting more hoots and jeers, Hermione looked around and back to Draco who began lighting a cigarette. 


  “What did she say?” She questioned, as the sultry music played out and slowly the women came back onto the stage, all dressed in the most revealing pieces of lingerie she’s ever seen. 


  “It’s the final act and it’s…inclusive.” He explained, blowing the air away from her while watching her furrow her brow at the stage. He had spent a majority of the show watching her in the mirror and her small reactions. It was far more fascinating than seeing his employees dance. 


  Hermione paid attention to the dancers who slowly walked off the stage and onto the main floor to the beat of the music. She looked up to see almost every woman blow Draco a kiss who nodded at each of them without so much of a smirk. All the dancers went to tables with either black or red colors, dancing around them, touching down their body until they pulled them out of the chair and made them follow them back onto the stage. 


  The redhead even stepped off stage, still singing, and slowly eyed their table. Hermione straightened her back, her breath catching her throat as she eyed the movement of her legs, the sway of her hips. She felt the spotlight stick on the redhead and it soon fell over their chair. The woman had walked up to Draco, leaned forward, making a show to stick out her bum and arch her back as she looked at the white flower on his tie. Even up close she was by far one of the prettiest women she had ever seen, maybe she was part Veela. 


  Still singing, the redhead gave Draco an almost disappointed pout but soon walked away, not even looking in her direction. Hermione felt something strange stir inside of her, it nestled uncomfortably in her stomach as she did her best to keep her head impossibly still and straight. 


  This was Draco’s club after all, it would be senseless to assume he’s never been involved with the beautiful women hired. It still made her uncomfortable, the woman had come up to him so assured of herself, like she had done it hundreds of times before and actually looked upset when she saw the white flower. Hermione felt insecure all over again. 


  Once the redhead had picked someone from the crowd, the dancers all lined up behind their chosen person in the chairs. Hermione was surprised that the dancers had picked an even number of men and women to participate in the last number. The lights changed to a demon like red, and the music slowed, only a bass was strumming out. They moved along with the lyrics and music, sensually touching their participants and swinging their bodies around the chair. They all climbed into their laps, moving and gyrating their bodies to give an exaggerated performance of a lap dance. 


  The patrons were smiling widely, eyes darkened while they heavily paid attention to the movements. The dancers swung their hips and grabbed the people’s hands, letting them trail over their body. The crowd was cheering, and Hermione thought the spectacle to be incredibly erotic. 


  She realized if Draco was wearing a different color boutonniere, he’d be sitting on stage in one of those chairs, while the redhead swayed her hips against his. The thought was maddening and made her cheeks sting. 


  The final notes rang out and each of the dancers planted a large kiss on their person’s lips, light exploded on the stage and small pyrotechnics went off overhead. Everyone stood and applauded, the performers cheered for their crowd members, they bowed smiles wide and then the redhead said something final to the crowd. 


  Hermione stood with the crowd, appreciating the craft and talent of the women and men who performed but still feeling a weird pang in her stomach when her eyes passed over the redhead. She was eyeing Draco, and a part of her was hoping she wouldn’t come over here. 


  “What did you think?” Draco asked her once they took their seats again. 


  Hermione unconsciously crossed her arms over her stomach, the action made Draco’s eyes flicker down and flit back up to her eyes. Something that resembled disappointment flashed over his eyes before settling on her face. 


  “It was very nice. They’re all extremely talented.” Hermione said truthfully, noticing the dancers heading into the crowd most likely to interact with the people and take a break at the bar. 


  Before Draco could respond, the redhead from the performance walked over to them, greeting Draco with a seductive smile. He stood to greet her, and Hermione sat as the two placed kisses on each other’s cheeks and engaged in a quiet conversation. She could see the redhead point to the flower with a frown and Draco tried to inconspicuously nod over to Hermione. She felt the redhead stare at her while she spoke with Draco. She twitched in her seat, trying to make herself appear unintimidated. 


  The redhead stepped away from Draco, moving to Hermione, she sent a very warm and sweet smile to her. “Did you enjoy the performance?” 


  Hermione looked up, her voice was just as beautiful when she talked compared to her singing. Her accent was extremely thick, somehow adding to the overall appeal of her. She bit her lip and nodded politely. 


  “It was lovely. You were fantastic.” She bit back her jealousy and gave the woman a compliment, Draco watched the two interact with a breath held in his chest. 


  “Thank you, I hope you stay for the next show.” The woman told her and walked away, giving both her and Draco a very meaningful expression. 


  Hermione felt awkward, not sure how to proceed with conversation with Draco and finding some solace in knowing more than thirty minutes had passed. She had successfully fulfilled her end of the deal, meaning she was free to go and hide under the sheets. 


  “So, would you like to stay?” Draco asked.


  “This has been very…eye opening and given me a lot of insight into…you as a…erm, a businessman. but I think I’m good for the night.” Hermione said, feeling oddly defeated.


  “Really Granger? What’s wrong now?” Draco asked in an unbelievable tone. 


  “I—I just feel weird. Like I’m intruding on your…fun. I—you stay, I should go.” She stumbled over her words and it made Draco let out a small disbelieving chuckle. 


  “I am having fun. You have no idea how entertaining you are.” 


  “You don’t ha—“ 


  “I’m being serious, Hermione.” Draco said, his head leveling with hers so she can’t escape his penetrating eye contact. “I’m enjoying myself because you’re here. You are again the sexiest witch in my club and I can hardly take my eyes off you. I’ve been watching you in the mirror the whole time, watching every moment your eyes widen and your skin blushes when you witness something provocative. Your body is hypnotizing, and it seems my attention isn’t the only one you've captured.” 


  She was still, so much so she appeared to be petrified. His words were shocking and she wondered if she were ever going to stop feeling caught off guard by his astounding bluntness. Her mind was reeling over his confession, until she understood the last part. 


  “What—what do you mean?” She questioned, making Draco send her a cocky little smirk. He leaned in closer, bringing a hand to tuck her hair behind her ear with gentle care. His lips were right at her ear, cold against her burning skin. 


  “Yvonne, the main performer who I spoke with, is curious about you.” 


  “Curious?” She asked, a shiver running through her body. 


  “She thinks you’re stunning and would love for you to be the one she brings on stage during the final number. The only reason she didn’t last performance was because you’re in white. She came over to me and asked if you’d change your mind for her.” He explained and Hermione felt her eyes widen at the revelation, she pulled back and gave Draco a staggering look. 


  “Me?” She gasped. 


  “Yes you.” He confirmed 


  “I—I thought she wanted you.” 


  “Yvonne prefers women. The only time I’ve ever bought women here is for her to pursue.” He continued and Hermione felt as if he shot a stupefy at her chest. 


  “So, would you like to stay? They go on in an hour, it’ll be a different performance but the end will be the same. Yvonne would love for you to be the one to join her on stage.” 


  Hermione swallowed and suddenly time had floated by in mere seconds. She agreed to stay, something in knowing the most beautiful woman had her eyes on 
  
    her, 
  
  not Draco or even another woman, but 
  
    her, 
  
  it was one of the most flattering feelings Hermione had ever felt. 


  The show began, more centered around aerial performances and pyrotechnics. It was incredible and Hermione noted that there were no singing performances done by Yvonne, until the last act. Draco had his arm strung over the couch once more, his body slouched into the lounge chair, leaning into Hermione, one ankle crossed on his knee as she sat straight up, attentive to every movement of Yvonne. 


  When the dancers strolled onto the floor, Hermione held her breath as Yvonne walked to them. She looked at Draco for approval who nodded once then centered her gaze on Hermione with a seductive expression. She reached for Hermione’s hand and pulled her up and she followed, her legs felt like air. 


  She was led on stage and took a seat in the wooden chairs, just as the other attendees. Yvonne sang and the dancers began to move to her voice. Hermione felt her breath speed up when a soft hand trailed along her collarbone. She tried not to squirm in the spotlight, but her eyes could still make Draco’s form in the darkness.


  He sat in the same position, looking casual as ever, his eyes not moving anywhere else. Yvonne trailed her hand down Hermione’s front and pulled it away before it reached her center, making her fingers curl tightly around her seat. She stepped forward, smiling at Hermione then sinking down into a squat, her arse towards the crowd and her hand sliding up her ankle, then to her calf and up her thigh. 


  Hermione couldn’t breathe. Her eyes flickered down to Yvonne’s then back up to Draco’s. Both his feet were on the ground, he leaned forward in his seat, lighting a cigarette, dark eyes still watching her. Yvonne continued singing but Hermione could barely hear the words. A woman had never touched her so erotically, and now it was happening in public. She could feel her center flutter and she almost squeezed her legs tightly together. 


  Draco watched with heavy eyes, paying attention to the way Hermione’s breasts pushed against the corset when she began to breathe harder, loving the way her eyes sparkled in wonder under the light and imagined it was him touching her the way Yvonne was. This, right now, was his favorite show his club had ever put on, he had to shift his trousers. 


  Yvonne straddled Hermione, taking her hands and running them down her body, over her breasts and moved to cover her arse. She felt speechless and entirely stunned. Her brown eyes clung to the deep blue of Yvonne’s, too afraid to look anywhere else. Her body was on fire and she was certain she’d melt into a puddle. 


  She was pulled to her feet, and the dancers switched places with their people. Hermione now stood facing the crowd, eyes immediately found Draco’s. As Yvonne hands shamelessly groped her legs, stomach and breasts, she could make out the faint muscle of Draco’s jaw moving. Yvonne stood, swinging her body around Hermione’s and pressing up against sensitive skin.


  As the final notes rang out, Hermione knew what was coming. Her chest was thumping as loudly as the base and she felt her limbs go numb. Draco was intently watching, eyes dark, he nearly looked like a feral animal. Yvonne brought a hand up to Hermione’s shoulder, moving it to her neck as she finished the song. Time slowed, blood rushed to her face as Yvonne brought her lips down onto Hermione’s. 


  She immediately gasped, the sensation and knowledge that a woman was kissing her gave her a thrilling yet taboo sensation fly throughout her body. Her lips were softer than Draco’s, her movement’s more precise and she briefly slipped her tongue into Hermione’s mouth. Hermione sighed and bravely flicked her own tongue against hers before Yvonne pulled away completely and smiled at Hermione with a hungry expression. 


  Hermione was led back to her table after the applause where Draco stood waiting. Yvonne said something in French, smiling wildly at Draco, her hand clasped around Hermione’s. She stood silent as they exchanged words, still in a cloud after the performance she was given. She snapped out of it once she felt Draco’s cool palm replace Yvonne’s. She looked up at him, his eyes were blown black and face was emotionless. 


  Yvonne frowned at something Draco said but stepped forward to kiss him on the cheek goodbye and turned to place a surprising yet chaste kiss on Hermione’s lips. 


  “Visit me again, beautiful.” Yvonne whispered into her ear, making Hermione flush impossibly hard. 


  Draco pulled them away, tightly squeezing Hermione’s hand. She wondered why he suddenly was acting short with Yvonne, their departure seemed so abrupt. He walked them up stairs, passed the coat check and out the exit. Hermione weakly protested for her jacket, not understanding why Draco looked angry at that moment. 


  He apparated them straight into his villa once they were outside of the club. Hermione felt dizzy with their quick disappearance. She looked at Draco, her face forming into a worried frown when she saw his cold eyes. 


  “Draco is,—did I do something wrong?” She insecurely asked. She had complied with his wishes for the evening, eventually relaxing and even getting a lap dance at his club. She had fun and couldn’t think of one thing that went wrong. 


  “No.” His voice was hoarse and he stepped to her, she took a half step back. The look he had could only be described as dangerous. 


  “Then…why do you look mad?” She swallowed and wetted her lips. He continued his descent on her. His eyes moved over her body, making her take a sharp inhale. Her feet stopped working, her body told her to wait for him, wanting to be caught by him. 


  “Because,” he said, wrapping an arm around her back and roughly tugging her body into his, a low growl rising from his chest, “I don’t like sharing.”

  
    Chapter Text
    “Then…why do you look mad?” She swallowed and wetted her lips. He continued his descent on her, eyes moved over her body, making her take a sharp inhale. Her feet stopped working, her body told her to wait for him, wanting to be caught by him. 
“Because,” he said, wrapping an arm around her back and roughly tugging her body into his, a low growl rising from his chest, “I don’t like sharing.” 
Hermione gasped, hands automatically grasping his thick biceps, attempting to steady herself. She didn’t have any time to collect her surprise, his mouth was already on hers, kissing her like he was angry. His tongue searched for hers immediately and he pulled it into his mouth, sucking on it before releasing it with a pop. Her mouth parted in shock, but he didn’t let her so much as breathe before kissing her once more. 
His hands greedily grabbed her backside, roughly palming her cheeks and giving one a harsh slap. This made Hermione break from his  lips, ready to ask what had come over him when everything seemed to be going smoothly, but his teeth scraped alongside her neck, marking her and soothing it with his lips and tongue. She let out a moan. 
“Do you know how maddening tonight has been?” He asked, voice husky as his hands loosened their grip on her arse and moved up her sides, delicately tracing over the patterns on the corset. His lips remained assaulting her sensitive skin, her hands knotted in his blonde hair. She couldn’t form a coherent response like this. 
“I have sat politely by,” he kissed her neck, “when you look fucking divine” he licked up to her ear, eliciting a soft gasp from her,  “and not touched you,” he bit her ear, catching her head when she titled it back, wrapping his hand in her now messy curls, “and not kissed you.” 
He rested his forehead onto hers, her fists clenched his shirt, scrunching it at the base of his abdomen. His one hand remained in her hair, locking her head in place while the other gently played with the button loops on her corset. Hermione felt drunk, her mind trying to remember if she had any drop of alcohol tonight when he suddenly popped the first button off her corset. 
“But instead I am forced to watch my friend do all those things.” Her eyes flew open, shocked at how forceful and raspy his voice sounded. He was jealous of Yvonne for taking her on stage and receiving a lap dance. 
“B-but I thought, you liked it.” She said, his breath fanning over her face in a huff. 
“No I didn’t.” He popped another button, her skin rising when his cool fingers uncovered more area on her back. “I was supposed to be the only one to touch you like that tonight.” 
Their eyes locked, Hermione could feel her lower region was slick against her panties. Draco looked like he was going to devour her, his eyes so serious and dark with desire, she wasn’t certain she wasn’t hallucinating everything he was doing and saying to her. 
In a bold moment, Hermione lifted up on her toes, pressing her breasts up and against his chest. She slid her hands up to his shoulders, fingertips playing with the fragile petal flowers still on his jacket. 
“What are you waiting for then…” Draco tightened his grip in her hair, eyes watching her lips. “Touch me.” 
Hermione felt time slow. Draco took his hands to the top of her corset and ripped it open from the back, small pearl buttons clattered to the floor. Her corset was thrown, body exposed and skin prickling for attention. He took a step back, eyes lavishly moving all over her exposed chest, to her stomach and legs and back up to her face, he didn’t know where to pay attention to the most.
“Look at you.” He slowly licked his lips, eyes meeting with a glowing smirk. “Fucking art.” 
Draco closed the distance between them, sealing their lips in a bruising and desperate kiss. She moaned when he bit her lip pulling it back with his teeth and suckling the pouty skin into his mouth. His hair was so soft, but her hands ached to feel his strong arms and then they’d suddenly move over his stomach, feeling the hardness of his muscles. He was too much for her to explore and she needed more time, but she didn’t want to slow down, and she didn’t want him to stop. 
In a swift movement, Draco bent down to pick her up, legs thrown around his waist as he easily carried her with one arm. She moved her head to his neck, teeth biting hard on his vein, wanting to know what made him moan and where his sensitive spots were. Finding it when she tentatively licked the shell of his ear before biting down on the lobe. His neck broke out in goosebumps and he let out a sound that resembled a whimper. 
Draco moved them to the balcony, laying Hermione down on the lounge chair, her skin shining under the moonlight. She was aware they were technically in public, but the street Draco’s villa was on seemed quiet, not much bustling city life. She felt something light inside her at the prospect of doing something dirty in public, it was electrifying. 
Reaching for his tie, she brought Draco to kneel over her, giving him her best seductive smile she could muster. She cupped his face, tongue looking for his as soon as their lips touched. It was slower, their mouths gradually building into a speed that made them both breathless. His hands touched her stomach, drawing lazy lines up and down, only reaching the bottom of her breasts. She tried to push against him, silently begging for more. 
Draco finally released her lips, moving down her body with gentle kisses, blowing on the skin to make it extra sensitive for him. His mouth hovered over a nipple, giving it a teasing flick with his tongue then taking it into his mouth, making Hermione sigh heavily. One of his hands trailed down her front, lightly sliding two of his fingertips over her covered slit. Draco felt how damp the fabric already was, his arrogance sky rocketed. 
“You’re soaking through your panties, Granger.” He mumbled against her chest, moving his mouth to give her other taut nipple the attention it deserved. 
Hermione bucked her hips up, seeking more touches, more kisses, more friction, more anything. She wanted to ask him to fuck her right now, but all that came out was a whining noise. 
Draco gave a dark chuckle before rising to his knees. She watched with heavy eyes as his slender fingers unclicked the garters from her knickers. His fingers hooked into the fabric and gray eyes flashed up to her face. 
“As much as I loved seeing you in this,” he began, slowly moving it down her legs, “I’d much rather see that pretty cunt of yours.” 
His words sent a jolt of lightning straight into her center, leaving her more needy for any relief he could offer. He left the stockings and heels on, bending down once more and throwing her legs over his shoulders. He looked at her glistening center with dark delight, his eyes closed and his tongue languidly moved over her arousal. 
Hermione’s eyes rolled into her head and a long, low moan ripped from her chest. She melted into the feeling, finally getting something she needed. Draco was slow and purposeful with his tongue, ensuring she would shake once he brought her to her release. He inserted two fingers into her, groaning while he flicked his tongue over her clit, feeling her walls welcome him deeper in. 
“Draco, oh fuck, yes.” 
He looked up, seeing her writhe under his touch and sending her moans up into the night sky, the view was too much for him. He removed his mouth, lips wet with her juices. He made an obscene gesture of sticking his slick fingers into his mouth, sucking her right off of him. 
Hermione was now consciously aware she was totally exposed and Draco had only just now shed his jacket, she hadn’t felt his bare skin on her own yet. That just wouldn’t do. She sat up, hands moving to pull his shirt from his trousers and attempting to loosen his tie. Draco’s own hands took over, swiftly removing the clothes.
His tattoos were revealed and her eyes lit up when she finally took in his body. He was bloody fit. Her hands moved to his trousers, his hardened member was straining through the fabric. She was eye level with it. Looking up once at Draco, she saw his gaze patiently waiting for her to make a move. Turning her stare down, she cautiously undid his zipper and popped the button, tugging it down to his thighs. He wore white briefs and oh gods, she saw how thick he was through the see through material. 
Winding her tiny hands into the briefs, she pulled them down, freeing his member that stood straight as a board, his dark red tip dripping with pre-cum. She could make out some dark blonde tufts of hair at the base and saw a thick purple vein run around him.
Now Hermione had spent the last week thinking of their previous activities, and since she was the only one who was pleasured, she thought about what he could possibly look like if she were to give him head, but she was certainly not expecting this. His height was astounding, so of course she naturally assumed he was going to be bigger. He was long, definitely one of the biggest she’s been with but that’s not what made her eyes glaze over. Draco Malfoy’s dick was incredibly thick. She didn’t think her hand would wrap entirely around him, she doubted she’d be able to fit him deep into her mouth. 
Hesitantly reaching for his cock, she took him in one hand and proved herself right. Her fingertips didn’t touch her palm and she still had an inch left of him from her pointer finger to thumb. She gave a testing stroke, tilting her head back to look up at him. 
Draco was watching with his mouth hung open, hands clenched at his side. Hermione took her unoccupied hand and reached for one of his, keeping eye contact with him and she guided his fingers to tangle with her curls. He felt his legs weaken when she parted her mouth over the tip of his cock. She sucked the tip so lusciously, like it was her favorite lolli and she was afraid the taste wasn’t going to last. 
Releasing his stare, Hermione closed her eyes and did her best to relax her mouth, letting her cheeks cave in around him when she pulled him away. She heard a soft hiss from above her. His other hand wove into her curls, following suit like the other and he began to gently bring her head back and forth. 
Usually, the action would have made her upset, but she didn’t mind his large hands helping her along, she found it rather hot that he was softly coaxing her to take more of him. Her hand twisted, her mouth only being able to fit half of him. 
Even as she struggled to take more, she still found it heavily arousing to have him in her mouth, kneeling high above her. She increased the speed of her mouth and hand, salvia dripping down her lips and onto him. He cursed and threw his head back, willing himself to stop her movements before getting too deep and finishing before he truly felt her. 
Pulling her off his cock with a small pop, seeing a rope of her saliva still connected from her lips to his tip almost made him push her head back onto him. Instead, he stood up, took off his pants and shoes then reached for her hand. Hermione accepted, legs slightly wobbly once he brought her to her feet. She didn’t understand what he wanted until he leaned down to her ear. 
“Get on top of me.” He sat upright against the chair, still holding her hand, legs automatically following his directions. He gripped her waist as she lowered herself onto his lap, holding herself up by his broad shoulders. 
A wave of nervousness crashed over her like someone had dumped her into water. Her body was wound up, gasoline poured over her and Draco had lit the match hours ago, but now she felt this was too fast, this was too much. Why the sudden halt?
Draco’s hands had calmly slid up and down her sides while she contemplated their position. Her stomach turned in an unpleasant way and she worried if she told Malfoy her hesitations, he’d be so put off, that their night would end and so would their new entanglement. Men hated being led on, and right now they were both naked, all the signs to go for it were there but now her mind was screaming to wait.
He noticed her hesitation, her eyebrows creasing with worry as she looked down as his member. She had been frowning for a few seconds and he could easily read her face full of doubt. His pointer finger and thumb took her chin, lightly lifting until brown eyes met his. 
“Hey.” He said, keeping his voice as calm and reassuring as possible, a dramatic shift from the dominating personality a moment ago. “We don’t have to do anything you don’t want.” 
 Hermione felt her chest tighten with admiration. A weight flew off her shoulders and she softly bit her cheek, staring into his eyes that mirrored the color of the moon. She calmed and Draco noticed the tension leave her body. He leaned forward and sweetly kissed her, not moving his lips but savoring the feel of her mouth against his. 
“Can we do something different? I still want to get you off.” He whispered, pulling back enough to watch her reaction. 
“Like what?” 
His eyes gleamed and large hands grasped the softness at her hips. Her breathing slightly increased as he pulled her hips slightly forward, her slick center moving up against his length though he never entered. He was gliding her over him, her wetness completely covering his length. She gasped, the teasing sensation of him right there but not conventionally satisfying her made her stomach clench. 
“This okay?” Draco asked, voice straining and shaking as Hermione found a pace to grind her hips against his member, ensuring with every movement, his cock would be drenched with her juices. 
Hermione nodded eagerly, their pants mingling in the cool air. The thickness of his dick spread her folds open, his tip pushed against her clit when she’d jerk back. Draco’s eyes lulled, mesmerized by her body moving on top of him, hypnotized by her tits bouncing and wishing he could bottle up the soft moans falling from her lovely pink lips. 
The feeling was indescribable. She could feel her body dampen with each passing minute as her center craved to be filled. Her hips slid over him, back and forth, back and forth and her head fell onto her shoulder. The feeling of slow and gradual pleasure took over. She confidentially leaned forward, hands holding onto his neck while his own hands splayed over her arse, her lips found his, they exchanged moans, warm breaths and tangled tongues. 
Draco’s hand moved up her back, gripping the hair at the base of her neck as the other fell between them. His thumb attached to her clit, rubbing circles over the bud to match the pace of her hips. She cried into his mouth, body jolted forward as a new desperate wave of desire flooded into her. Draco growled as her hips snapped forward faster, his cock was soaked and he achingly needed to be inside her, fill her until they were both delirious with pleasure. 
Her body tightened and she could feel her end, his cock effortlessly slid between her folds, his thumb circling over her clit in the way she needed the most. 
“I’m—I’m close.” She whined and he huffed, his mouth latched onto her neck, sucking the sensitive skin until she bruised, a reminder of him. His thumb pressed down and he could feel the muscles in her body squeeze and tense. 
“Come on Granger, let go for me.” He coaxed sweetly into her ear, still holding her head in place as she relentlessly grinded down on him. 
Her toes curled, stomach fluttered with heat and she shut her eyes, focusing on the rough, pressing sensation of his thumb. 
“I— oh Draco!” She shouted and her hips spasmed, her body fell forward as she weakly moved against his member, riding out her orgasm. She flushed with heat, skin slick with sweat and thighs drenched with her own wetness. 
Draco removed his thumb and placed his hands on her bare back, rubbing up and down as her breathing calmed. Her forehead rested on his shoulder, Malfoy’s chin resting against the top of her head. Her body felt depleted, energy drained. He shifted up, arms wrapping around her body, cradling her until she was hoisted into the air. 
He bounced her up his body, her arms tightly grasping his shoulders and legs weakly circling his hips. She felt heavy and spent, but he moved like she was weightless. He brought them into the master bedroom, gently lowering them both back onto the plushness of the bed. Malfoy’s lips found her cheek, then chin until they reached her lips, kissing her languidly until he gave out his own moan. 
Hermione pushed at his shoulders until he rolled off, laying by her side, hand on her hip pulling her into him. She scooted closer, fingers trailing over the dragon on his arm, scratching at the soft skin until she felt goosebumps rise to the surface. She kissed him deeply, wanting to hear his chest vibrate with gravely moans. He was still erect, and it dawned he had yet to get his own release. 
She pushed her hips forward, lower belly feeling him against her and he again gave out a soft moan. Her hand hesitantly traveled up his bicep and over his chest, and she slowly let her fingertips glide down his abs, happy to feel the muscles clench under her touch until she felt the coarse hair at his navel. She came in contact with the head of his cock, wet with his own arousal. 
Pulling back from his lips, she whispered unsure. “Can I—?” 
“If you want.” Draco gruffly responded, his face only visible from the city lights outside. She stared at his features for a moment, angled jaw with defined cheekbones, lips damp and dark red and eyes the color of mercury. He looked like a mythical god. 
She pushed his shoulders down and sat up, he complied with her actions, patiently waiting for her to get comfortable between his legs. She kneeled down, bowing her body and automatically engulfing her mouth around him, tasting the remnant flavors of her own arousal. 
Draco groaned loudly, and moved one arm under his head, the other fisting her hair until it was wrapped around his knuckles, allowing him to watch her work. Hermione sucked slowly, giving herself time to re-accommodate her mouth to his size. Both of her fists twisting up and down his length, spreading her spit over him. She tried to push more of him in, tears sprung in her eyes and she felt him pull her head back and kept her from pushing herself too far. 
He was panting and swearing, the view of her lips wrapped around him too much for his brain to handle. She was trying so hard to take more of him in her mouth, and that alone made him want to come. Her tiny hands jerked what she couldn’t take, milking him to his end even at the torturous pace. He lightly pulled her off of him, nearly wheezing when her lips were slick and eyes glinting. 
“What’s wrong?” She worriedly asked. 
“Nothing at all. I’m getting close and wanted to ask something.” He told her, lifting up to his elbows. 
“Okay…and that is…” Draco sat up, large hands holding her face as he fiercely kissed her. She held onto his dark forearms, taken aback by how forceful his kiss was. 
“You can say no,” He kissed her. “But I’d love a chance to come on your chest.” He mumbled into another kiss. Hermione furrowed her brows. 
“You mean,” he kissed her, swallowing her words, “you want to come,” he gave a particularly long, searing kiss, “on my breasts?” 
Draco pulled back, eyes dancing like flames of a fire, a dark gaze casted down over her body as he drank her in. 
“Fuck yes,” he leaned to kiss all over her neck, lapping at the sweaty skin that tasted like candy to him, “if you’ll let me.” 
Hermione shut her eyes and allowed his gluttonous attention, her center tightening when his teeth nipped at her collarbone. His arms strengthened it’s hold around her body and she arched into him. 
“Can I?” He mumbled into her neck, licking a line up to her ear as she tried to remember his original question through a foggy mind.
“Hm?” 
Draco chuckled darkly, sucking at her earlobe. “Can I come on your tits Granger?” He asked again, mouth finding hers, tongue diving deep until it captured her own. 
She pulled back breathless, his icy hands teasing her sides, making her shudder. She watched his tongue lick his bottom lips before his teeth took it into his mouth. Her head nodded and she watched as a seductive grin moved over his face, jaw clenched down. 
“Get on the floor for me.” He told her and she moved off of him, listening to instructions. Draco sat at the edge of the bed, his cock twitched when he saw Hermione kneel on the ground, hair wild and untamed, eyes wide and dark with lust, she was gorgeous. 
Hermione held his eye contact, hands reaching for his, wanting them tangled in her hair helping her along as she took his length into her mouth. Draco’s throat went dry as his fingers wove into the silky curls, her head moved forward until he felt her hot breath fan over him. She licked from the tip of him down to his base and then back up before taking the head into her mouth. Hermione closed her eyes and focused on sucking him, moving at a quicker pace than before. Her hands found rhythm, tongue gliding relentlessly, lubricating him until he was completely covered with her saliva. 
“Fuck, Hermione, keep going.” He groaned, and Hermione pushed herself farther down him, willing herself not to cry.
Draco tried to commit the sight before him to memory as he found his resolve slipping. Her mouth was moving faster, the sounds of her lips sucking him made his stomach flutter and balls tighten, he was going to come. 
With one fast movement, Draco pulled her off of him and Hermione automatically kneeled as tall as she could. His jaw went slack as he watched his semen coat her chest, white strands dripping down, covering her petal colored nipples and sliding over her stomach. Her mouth was slightly open, more shocked than anything when he finished. She stared as his orgasm hit, extremely attracted to how he looked, caught up in his own pleasure, pleasure that she gave him. 
His hands were still in her hair, thumb absentmindedly stroking her cheeks, every so often rubbing over her lips as he controlled his breathing. She sat back, watching this giant of a man breath heavily through his nostrils, sweat breaking over his forehead was maybe the single most attractive thing she’s witnessed. 
After a moment passed, Draco accio’d his wand and cleaned her chest off. He reached down and picked her up by her waist, bringing her back on the bed with him.  Hermione plopped down, his inked arm with the swirls of a galaxy flew over her body and cradled her closer to him. Draco nestled his head on top of hers and shut his eyes. He was already heavily breathing, and Hermione used the sounds to calm her into her own sleep. Throughout the night, it seemed neither person strayed far away from the other, always making sure their bodies were touching or entwined in some way and it stayed that way well into the morning.
  
    Chapter Text
    
  “Hermione for the love of 
  
    Merlin, 
  
  just bloody owl him!” Ginny laughed at her friend’s indecisiveness, feeling fed up that she kept going back and forth on the issue. 


  “No! He owled Monday, I owled Tuesday. He owled Thursday, I responded Thursday. It’s his turn now.” She said, huffing out loud and crossing her arms over her chest. 


  “Who cares!? You’re a twenty-first century witch, owl him if you want, ask him out yourself.” Ginny pushed, rummaging through the bin of nail polish. 


  Hermione shook her head and reached for the dark red, shaking the bottle a few times before slowly removing the cap and holding the bottle between her knees. 


  “I told you I don’t want to ask him out.” Hermione responded. Ginny snorted. 


  “Right right, you just want him to fuck your brains out.” 


  “Ginny!” Hermione shrieked. 


  “Well! Am I wrong?” She chuckled, deciding on a light blue color for herself. 


  The witches were spending their Friday staying in and having a girls night, which of course included playing a tacky muggle board game Hermione had brought from her parent’s house, a lot of wine and nail painting. Ginny had brought up if she were seeing Malfoy again this weekend, which launched into a broader discussion of what was currently going on between the two. 


  Hermione found herself easily flustered. When she returned from Paris, Draco had made no promise to see her again, so neither did she. Their intense night, and morning, considering he made her come orally before they left, seemed like it was open ended. Hermione did her best to remain indifferent and not let him see her act somewhat disappointed when he only kissed her hand goodbye from her doorstep…again. 


  Color her surprised when a large package was delivered to her home on Monday, containing her fully repaired lingerie set, a note apologizing for tearing the corset and thanking her for a “most exhilarating weekend.” Hermione felt her heart skip a beat and a small pool of hope form in her body. Trying not to get ahead of herself, she calmly thought of a cool response. 


  After she wrote a proper thank you, she asked Ginny for advice on how to sneak a cheeky sentence or a flirty message into the mundane note. Ginny, too excited for her own good, came up with something that was a little racy, so the two decided to thank him and stated that Hermione looks forward to wearing it again. 


  Wednesday passed with no response and Hermione and Ginny argued back and forth about the wording of the message. Ginny even offered to reach out to Blaise for his advice but Hermione vehemently protested. Thursday was a saving grace, he responded with an equally raunchy message. Ginny had squealed in delight, Hermione had felt herself blush to the point she couldn’t speak. His note clearly stated he’d enjoy if he received an invite on the day she ever decided to wear it, or he’d be more than happy to take her back to the Cherry Pit in a new outfit it she pleased.  


  Hermione and Ginny acted like children, giggling and fighting over what to say back, if anything. Hermione thought she shouldn’t respond, try to play hard to get, make it seem like her interest wasn’t entirely on him. Ginny disagreed, thinking she should flirt back, claiming it’s like leaving crumbs until he finds the cookie. Deciding on a happy medium, she wrote back something along the lines that she could be persuaded for another night like the one they had last week. 


  To both the girls' disappointment, he had yet to respond, Ginny remained hopeful but Hermione’s positive attitude was dwindling. 


  “Look, if you want to see him, just owl again or I’ll mention something to Blaise so we can all set something up.” She suggested, her laser focus settled on the strokes of the nail polish. 


  “No. I don’t want Blaise to get involved and get the wrong impressions which in turn makes Malfoy get the wrong impression. Besides, I can’t go on any double dates with you and Blaise. Malfoy and I—we’re, it’s, it’s just…physical, I think.” Hermione explained once more, finding herself confused over her own words and Ginny only rolled her eyes, muttering a soft disagreeing statement under her breath. 


  “I’m more intrigued about how quickly things are progressing between you and Blaise anyways.” Hermione quickly changed the subject, actually wanting to hear how the former Slytherin was treating her. Ginny’s lips formed a coy smile, her cheeks coloring to rose. 


  “He’s good. We’re great. It feels like…like he’s already my best friend. There’s just something there.” She spoke, her eyes going glassy like she was under a love potion, but Hermione smiled. “I don’t know. I want to take it slow but we’re just, 
  
    good. 
  
  Everything is so fun with him, you know?” 


  Ginny rambled, her eyes casted down and Hermione’s mind flashed to an image of a certain blonde. “I know.” She quietly responded. 


  “You know what’s crazy too? We haven’t even had sex yet!” Ginny said and Hermione’s eyes flew up in astonishment. 


  “What? It’s been two weeks now? You’ve gone on plenty of dates and you stayed over at his multiple nights.” Hermione said, not believing her rambunctious best friend had waited so long to bed the handsome wizard. 


  “I know. But he didn’t want me to think he was just after my body, or that this was a quick fling. Believe me, I’ve tried plenty of times but he just won’t budge. It’s bloody annoying.” Ginny mumbled, making Hermione chuckle. 


  “I mean, it’s so odd. He 
  
    enjoys 
  
  giving me oral, said he could do it all day—“ 


  “Okay. Ginny—“ Hermione tried to cut her off, not exactly wanting to hear all about her sexual experiences. 


  “And, gods, his fingers! Simply one of a kind. I think he’s so good with them because he knows how to play the harp—“ Ginny said, her eyes glowing with delight. 


  “Oh dear—“ Hermione said, reaching for her own wine glass. 


  “Plus, I’ve only given him a blowie once, ONCE Hermione! And he nearly came in under a minute. It was the best feeling ever.” She gloated, proudly bobbing her head. 


  “Ginny! Come on, at least wait for the sex talk until I’m another glass deep, please?” Hermione said, her body flushing with the knowledge her friend was providing. 


  “Fine. I’m holding you to that though, so drink up.” Ginny smirked, blowing on her nails. 


  Two hours later, two wine bottles finished and the game of Life completely ruined from far too many questions, the girls were now laughing on the floor, giving each other fake future life stories. 


  “And, and you have three blue children, named Willard, Beacon, and Dino!” Ginny yelled while throwing the plastic bits from the board game at Hermione. She was crying of laughter, trying to catch each of her ‘children’. 


  “Willard? Ugh you are evil! Can’t I at least have a daughter? You are hoarding them.” Hermione cried, reaching over the board game to take the small pink plastic pieces from Ginny’s hand, effectively snapping the cardboard in half. Ginny and Hermione both gasped, looking down at the broken game before bursting out into gut wrenching laughter. Ginny toppled over to the side and Hermione drunkenly chucked the broken game across the room and cast a spell to make it explode. 


  The girls’ laughter quickly died down when they heard clicks at their window, an owl sitting outside with two letters in its beaks. 


  “That’s Blaise’s owl.” Ginny said, stumbling to get up, accidentally knocking over a pile of books. She opened the window, a cool breeze passing over their living room. “There’s a letter addressed to you.” 


  Hermione looked over her shoulder to where Ginny stood, a confused expression written over her face. “From Blaise? What for?” 


  She stood up, wobbling at first, and strode over to the window, eyes trying to focus on the letter in Ginny’s hand. “No it’s not from Blaise, probably Malfoy. Theodore Nott and him are at Blaise’s having their own boys night.” She explained, while handing her the note. 


  Hermione’s stomach fluttered, Malfoy sent her a letter the same time as Blaise sent his witch one, could it mean something? 


  “Open yours first.” Hermione instructed and Ginny rolled her eyes, breaking the seal. She immediately squealed, bouncing on her feet in a strange little happy dance. Hermione moved beside her, pulling the paper down so she could read it. “What is it?” 


  Blaise’s note was an excerpt from an old wizard’s journal, a love poem, with of course hints of longing and desire. It was extremely sweet and romantic. He wrote his own words at the bottom explaining he will go to sleep dreaming of her and looks forward to their date tomorrow.


  “You lucky witch.” Hermione said and Ginny only shrugged, re-reading the sonnet over and over with a small smile on her lips. 


  “Read yours now.” Ginny gestured, carefully folding her paper back into the envelope. Hermione tore her envelope open, her letter much smaller and more to the point.


  “‘Are you free during the day tomorrow?’” Hermione read out loud, no lingering hints of romance or passion like Ginny’s had read. But Ginny was different, she was dating a wizard and Hermione was just…exchanging pleasure with one. 


  “Yes! The teasing notes worked! You snagged his attention.” Ginny found the note to be a victory, but as she looked at the creased frown on her friend’s lips, she wondered if something was lost in translation. “What’s wrong? I thought you wanted to see him?” 


  Hermione bit her lip, his soulless words not sending fire through her body anymore. She didn’t just want his attention, she wanted him to get excited when he saw her owl, blush anytime he thinks about her and know that he’s struggling to focus on work or menial tasks or anything else because she’s filling all his thoughts. It was just physical, but she was jealous of Ginny. She wanted to be pined after and someone to think she’s more worthy than just a once a week meet up. It didn’t have to be Malfoy, but then again, he was the one she thought of all week.


  “I—I do.” She shook her head, feeling absolutely insane. “Nothing’s wrong, I think I’m going to wait to respond though.” 


  “Why? You’re not doing anything tomorrow, you’ve been itching to see him all week and he wants to see you during the day, that’s a good sign.” Ginny encouraged, trying not to interfere with her own opinions too much but her friend definitely needed a push in the right direction. Hermione was quiet for a moment, seeming to ponder her words. 


  “You think?” Hermione asked, uncertainty loud in her voice. 


  “I know. And if our boys are as drunk as us, they’ll be elated to hear from us so quickly, so here.” Ginny thrusted parchment and a quill to Hermione, and grabbed her own. Both girls spent a couple of minutes in a drunken blur trying to decide what to write in Ginny’s letter. 


  “I think this is good. And if he doesn’t like it well he can shove it up his pretty firm arse.” Ginny said, hiccupping at the end, making Hermione snort. 


  They sent off their letters and decided they should clean the mess in the living room. Both agreed that maybe one more glass of wine would be the perfect amount for them before they headed to bed. Ginny suggested they order sweets from the little shoppe that makes deliveries until midnight, Hermione agreed. Picking up their landline Arthur had insisted for Ginny to buy, Hermione called the store, asking for some warm cookies and ice cream to pair. Once the order was finished and a total was given, Hermione began walking back into their front room. 


  “Okay I got two double fudge, one birthday cake and a chocolate chip oatmeal monster cookie with two pints of—“ 


  Hermione reached the living room, words halting in her throat when she looked at the new company comfortably sitting in her home. Ginny was sitting next to Blaise, hands interlocked while they both held Hermione’s confused gaze with a cheeky grin. Sitting on their chair was Malfoy, his lips barely turning up with a private smile as his eyes glanced over her body once. She swallowed, suddenly extremely self-conscious of being drunk and dressed in plaid cotton shorts and a tank top and definitely not dressed in lingerie. She noticed his own casual wear and nearly choked. Wearing gray joggers and a long sleeve dark green cotton shirt with three buttons undone at his neck, he looked far too attractive in such normal clothing, it made her flush. 


  “Granger.” Blaise nodded in greeting. “I hope you ordered us some sweets as well.” 


  Hermione’s eyes flashed back to Blaise’s, thankful that he was the first to break the seemingly awkward air. She gave him a smile and moved to sit next to them on the couch, the spot that was open was of course closest to where Malfoy sat. 


  “Had I known we’d have visitors I would have ordered more.” She sat down, turning her head at Blaise, trying her best not to squirm when she felt a certain pair of dark gray eyes bore a whole into her head. 


  “That’s okay, we can all share.” Ginny suggested. “I got the monster cookie and the birthday cake.” 


  “So Granger is a chocolate fiend? Sounds like someone else I know.” Blaise widely grinned while looking at Draco, who shrugged and scrunched up his sleeves. Hermione didn’t make a move to give him attention, instead she picked at the nail polish on her skin. 


  “Very true. I hope you’ll share with me Granger.” Draco’s deep voice commanded her attention, she couldn’t help but turn her head to meet his eyes, playful and teasing. She found herself nodding and muttered a quiet ‘sure.’ Ginny and Blaise gave each other a look and almost laughed at the pair in front of them. 


  “So what have you boys been up to tonight?” Ginny asked, stretching her feet onto the coffee table in front of them. 


  “Theo’s in town so we just had some drinks, played a couple card games, he decided to get a little too pissed so he’s currently passed out on my sofa.” Blaise explained, making Draco chuckle a bit. 


  “So, you just left him there?” Hermione asked, forehead creasing. 


  “In case he wakes up—“ Draco began.


  “Which he won’t.” Blaise butted in. 


  “We left a nice note, a glass of water and a hangover potion. We’re good friends, don't worry. Besides, we figured you two would be better company than a sleeping Theo.” Draco finished, eyes focused on the messy bun on top of Granger’s head.


  “How flattering. I agree, but don’t tell Theo that.” Ginny chimed in, earning a smile from Blaise. They were quite cute, even if Hermione did find it odd that Ginny would be cuddling with a former Slytherin, but of course, she’s one to talk. 


  The bell rang, signaling the delivery of their goodies and Hermione bounced up from the seat to retrieve the items and pay the delivery man. Malfoy watched her every move, from the lazy triumphant smile when she held up the bag, to the way her hips swung when she walked to the kitchen, and to the kinky curls that strayed loose from her bun around her shoulders. She disappeared into the kitchen, and Blaise and Ginny both raised their eyebrows at the blonde man, eyes nodding off in her direction. He rolled his eyes, finding it somewhat annoying how similar the two were, but got up from his seat and told them he’d assist her. 


  Hermione was scooping ice cream into four bowls, hearing footsteps behind her and assuming it was Ginny she started talking. 


  “I don’t know what kind of ice cream Blaise or Malfoy like so I’m just giving them one scoop of vanilla and one scoop of mint fudge.” She explained, giving herself two scoops of vanilla and breaking up one of her cookies in the bowl to mix in. 


  “I’d prefer two scoops of mint but I won’t fuss.” Draco said, arms crossed in front of his chest. Hermione jumped and turned around, spoon clinking to the floor. Raising his eyebrows at her, he bent down to pick up the utensil, taking a step to her body to place it in the sink beside her. She held her breath, eyes level with the exposed skin on his chest. 


  “Didn’t mean to scare you. Thought I’d offer some help.” He stated. 


  “Oh. Thank you.” She dumbly responded, brain not firing on all cylinders with his proximity and from the three and a half glasses of wine. His lips twitched up at her rising blush, or maybe it was the alcohol she had, either way her skin was pink and looked warm. He wanted to feel it against his palm. 


  Instead he reached behind her, stomachs barely brushing, but enough to make Hermione shiver. He wordlessly grabbed two bowls, balancing them in one of his large hands with ease. His other hand took the plate of giant cookies and then he finally pulled back, quirking a brow at her. 


  “Well come on then. I want to have my cookie.” He said teeth shining when he finished his sentence. 


  Hermione blew out a breath through her lips and grabbed the remaining two bowls, heading back into the living room and praying her face didn’t look too flustered. Draco had taken her spot on the sofa, sitting next to Blaise and Ginny who stood with their bowls in hand, crumbles of cookies hanging off their lips. 


  “We’re going to eat in my bedroom. Long night for both of us and we’re feeling pretty tired.” Ginny explained leading Blaise out of the room, letting Hermione stand dumbfounded and slightly panicked. 


  “Thanks for the food Granger.” Blaise said. “Night.” 


  “Night Mione, goodnight ferret!” Ginny called over her shoulder. “You two kids have fun!” She yelled before slamming her door. 


  Hermione stood in horror, staring down the hall and wishing the floor would swallow her up to save her from this embarrassment. 


  “Can I have my ice cream now?” Malfoy politely asked and Hermione dragged her line of vision to him. Her brain was still thinking before her legs decided to move on their own. Walking around the table, she handed him the bowl and sat down, leaving a good four feet of space between them. 


  She scooped the creamy dessert into her mouth, sighing at the taste of the warm cookie and cold cream, the perfect combination. They ate in silence, the scrap of metal against ceramic bowls filling the air between them. Malfoy wanted to laugh, even after their encounters and time together she still felt shy around him. 


  “How’s yours?” Draco asked after a minute or two, seeing that her bowl was essentially empty.


  “Good, how’s yours?” Hermione responded, glancing at his inked arms reaching to put his finished bowl on the table. He shifted closer, turning his body so he was facing her, slouching into the corner of the sofa. 


  “Wonderful, thank you. You really like those chocolate cookies, huh Granger?” Malfoy asked, running his tongue over his teeth, resting it on the corner of his mouth. 


  Hermione gave him an odd look and put her own bowl on the table, arms crossed over her stomach as she leaned into the couch, somewhat intentionally trying to put distance between them. 


  “Yes, they’re my favorite.” She told him, eyeing his movements when he slowly pushed off from the corner and moved a foot closer. 


  “Do you like wearing it as much as eating it?” He casually asked, head tilting to the side as he waited for Hermione to understand his question. He suppressed his smile as best he could, her nose crinkled when she looked at him confused, softly repeating the words until her eyes grew wide in realization. 


  “Oh my god.” Hermione panicked, embarrassment flooding her body as she turned her head to wipe any remaining chocolate off her mouth.


   Draco caught her forearm, easily stopping the movement, his hand cool against her blazing skin. She froze, her entire mind went blank, only being able to comprehend his hand on her arm and the other moving to her chin, lightly taking hold to move her head to him. Her dark eyes matched the color of the sweet dessert, the thought made his lips curve up. She stared into his eyes, following the cloudy grayness as they ran over her mouth. 


  His thumb swiped over her lower lip with the faintest of touches, she wasn’t even sure he did it. Pressing a little as he moved it upwards, his thumb captured the smallest remnants of chocolate from the corner of her mouth. He traced his thumb back over her lips, pressing down in the center until her lips parted, welcoming the digit into her warm, wet mouth. She immediately sucked him in deeper, wide eyes keeping ahold of his gray ones. 


  She swirled her tongue around the tip of his thumb, making Draco’s mouth part, a heat was sent straight to his cock. Leaning forward, he removed his thumb the second his lips found hers, soft and plump, slightly cold from the frozen treat. His chest vibrated with a suppressed grunt and Hermione felt a sigh fall from her lips into his own. Her hands flew up to his shoulder, fingertips digging into the clothed skin. 


  His tongue entered her mouth, and he begged her in his mind for her to suck his tongue like she did his finger. They’d break apart every so often, heavy pants and desperate gasps for air filled the silence. Draco’s hands touched and slid over her waist, bunching up the fabric of her tank top, needing to feel her hot skin under the pads of his fingers. 


  Hermione released a quiet whimper when he effortlessly pressed their bodies together, letting her feel the marbled muscles under his shirt. Her mind was reeling with decisions and questions. She could invite him to stay, but it would imply them to have sex, but she did want to have sex, or did she just want him around? 


  Before she made a decision, Draco’s hand slipped up her shorts, making her worries fall away. Pleased to find she was wet underneath, his pointer finger trailed up and down repeatedly over her slit, her legs widened just a fraction, hips pushing forward seeking something more. He grinned into her mouth, pulling her lip back with a snap between his teeth then immediately went back to suck on the dampened, red skin.


  As his pointer finger traced her outermost lower lips, Hermione felt her body quake with desire, wild with the need for him. Draco’s lips slowed over hers, holding their lips together without moving for long seconds. His finger pushed apart her folds, lightly tracing a line from her entrance to her clit, Hermione’s hips twitched. He smirked into their slow kiss, thinking she wasn’t so shy anymore now that he finally touched her. 


  Fisiting his hair, she threw her head back when he finally pushed a finger inside. She bit on her lip until it almost bled, trying her best to contain her moans wanting to rip out of her throat. She hastily kissed him, Draco momentarily shocked by her pressure. He sunk another finger into her, swallowing her whimpers as thrusted against her sensitive walls. 


  Hermione ripped her lips off his and went for his ear, sucking the lobe between her lips and lightly nipping. Her hand slid down his body, reaching for his hard length over his sweatpants. Draco groaned, cheeks stinging with warmth as she stroked him, his own movements briefly forgotten. He let her find him underneath his trousers, warm hand pumping him slowly, soft pants and breathy whimpers fanning his ear. 


  “Gods, Granger.” He whispered in a breath, making her walls tighten. 


  Draco began to pump his fingers faster making Hermione meet his pace with desperate thrusts of her hips. His palm was hitting her clit, causing a shock of voltage to rumble through her body, a rising heat forming. He leaned forward, her body against the arm of the sofa, hands leaving his member to grasp onto his arms, too distracted to take care of him but Draco didn’t care. 


  She gave a long, whining moan, her inside tightening and clutching at his fingers, the heat filling to the brim. Draco panted into her neck, his body hanging above hers while he milked her climax. Her fingers dug into his arms, her hips wildly bucking into his palm. 


  “Draco...yes, 
  
    yes.
  
  ”


  It was coming, her toes curled and she waited for the final push of his slender fingers to take her over the edge. She cried out but Draco covered her mouth with his own, shushing her with soft kisses as her center spasmed around his fingers. She sobbed into his mouth as he slowed his pace, letting her ride the waves of her orgasm until it was completely finished. His lips kissed her deeply, matching the calming pace of his fingers. 


  He began to peck her, Every time he pulled back he’d mumble.


  “Two o’clock tomorrow.” He kissed her again, fingers pumping once into her center, her whole body shook.


  “I’ll be here.” Another kiss, long and encompassing. 


  “Be dressed for the beach.” A final kiss, fingers giving one last final thrust before pulling out of her wet center and shorts. Daco pulled his body away, letting her see his mouth suck his glistening fingers, tasting her orgasm on his tongue. 


  Hermione barely heard his words, she was too preoccupied with the loss of his lips and his body fading away. Her mind was hazy and blurry, seeing him reach for her hand and kiss the top of it once before letting it fall away. 


  “Until tomorrow.” He smirked and stood up, his erection extremely noticeable in sweatpants,  but he paid it no mind. Walking over to the floo, Draco left without another word, leaving Hermione hot and bothered but extremely well spent, still trying to put the pieces together of the words he whispered into her mouth. 


  Two o’clock, tomorrow, going to a beach.

  
    Chapter Text
    
  “So, you and Theo bought a private beach and rent it out?” 


  Hermione asked, walking next to Draco on the sidewalk of Wizarding Brazil. After portkeying them, she had an abundance of questions of where they were, what beach they were going to, if they were visiting his other club, to which Draco revealed the beach was actually his. The beach which was of course renamed ‘Cherry Pit Cove’ and the first of his entrepreneur expeditions. He and Theo had purchased the land, offering a private and luxurious experience to Wizarding tourists. 


  “Yes and then some. The beach is warded, you pay for spots which you can rent out for half a day or a full day. You can buy package deals which give you unlimited drinks and food too.” Draco explained, eyes carefully overlooking the small street they were roaming on. Plenty of people were out and about during the nice weather and he found himself glaring at any man whose stare lingered a little too long at the witch beside him. 


  “That’s brilliant. What’s going to be next for you then?” Hermione questioned, still amazed by how thoughtful and innovative Draco was with his work. He gave a small smile, his chest swelling with pride at her compliment. 


  “Well I mentioned Barcelona, but that’s not even a possibility for at least another five years. But I’m happy with how much work I have with Paris and London right now. I can tinker and experiment with those clubs for a bit before looking for more to add on my plate.” He responded. 


  “Do people find it odd that your career isn’t a conventional one?” Hermione asked, somewhat curious as to what his parents think of his businesses. Draco paused for a moment, somewhat caught off guard by her question but more so that she was interested enough to ask. 


  “I mean, Blaise and Theo are obviously supportive. Theo was the one that really pushed me to invest in my ideas, that’s why he owns the beach with me. I think he knew I was…unsure if it was going to be successful so he offered to go half so I wouldn’t lose money all on my own.” Draco gave a small chuckle, raising a darkened hand to his forehead and pushing the longer hair out of his eyes. Hermione quite liked when he’d push his hair out of his face, half slicked back, half messy in front, he was too bloody attractive for his own good. 


  “And…your parents? Are they supportive of it all?” She tentatively asked, tilting her head to look up at him as they continued their walk. 


  “They were happy when I became a potions master. I worked in a small apothecary for a bit but was so bored and unhappy. I didn’t tell them my ambitions until they asked why I withdrew so much money from Gringotts.” He laughed again, shaking his head at the memory. 


  “Eventually I explained my and Theo’s goal for Brazil and my ideas for possible clubs. They were displeased of course, but within the last few years it’s been taking off and bringing a lot of revenue in for myself, so they keep quiet about it. Honestly as long as I’m staying out of trouble and making my own money, I think they’re okay with it.” 


  Hermione raised her eyebrows, slightly surprised he told his parents about his endeavors. “So, they know about the club in Paris?” 


  Draco tilted his head back and laughed, a large hand resting on his stomach as the sound filled the air around them. Hermione looked at him, admiring the way his cheeks moved when he smiled wide. 


  “Merlin no. Gods I hope they never find out. They’d probably berate me and threaten my life. They’re not exactly modern individuals.” His shoulders bounced as he calmed his laughing down, but the last part of his sentence made her frown. It was a cold reminder, one she conveniently shoved aside every time they were together. 


  “Yeah, I’m aware.” She bit back coldly, head turning away from him and to the beaches beside her. 


  Draco looked down at her, mentally cursing himself for his poor choice of words. There wasn’t much he could say to defend his parents, they were extremely proper purebloods with old views. Of course after the war they softened into more lenient ideas, but even that statement was a stretch. They wouldn’t openly speak of their distaste for muggles or how they have been essentially ostracized by the Wizarding community. They’ve accepted their pasts, grateful for the opportunity to be left alone and move on, but Draco would be lying if he said their views had changed completely. 


  It was uncomfortable, and Draco felt like if he weren’t to say something now, their time would be spoiled and she wouldn’t want to spend the afternoon together. 


  “Granger,” He said, trying to catch her attention but her head remained turned away from him, “I...I understand if what I’m about to say doesn’t mean anything, but they are different and trying. And they also don’t influence me. I’m—I’m different from them, I’ve changed, in every way.” 


  Hermione glanced at him, face extremely serious and stone, she wondered if he was holding his breath. Looking forward at the pavement in front of her, she sighed once and momentarily bit her tongue. She knew he was different, but hearing of his parent’s struck a hard nerve and she hardly believed they were attempting to be model citizens. The conversation had turned bitter and though she didn’t need to say anything, she couldn’t, it wasn’t like her to hold back. But taking in his expression, she could clearly see he was pleading for her to differentiate him between his parents and his past. She has, but that didn’t mean it sometimes didn’t hit her like a cold crashing wave.


  “I know you are. That’s easy to see.” She told him, offering a half smile to him which instantly made his shoulders relax. “So, how much further is the cove?” 


  Draco, grateful for her changing the subject, pointed to the three huts about a half block in front of them, a wide open beach with calming waves and zero people populating it behind them. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a packet of gum and popped a piece into his mouth.


  “Just there. Now I forgot to mention one tiny little detail.” He admitted, always seeming to wait until the very last minute to unveil important details to ensure the little witch won’t run away. Hermione rolled her eyes, such a Slytherin. 


  “What? Is it a nude beach?” She joked. Draco was silent for multiple beats, his jaw flexing sharply with every chew of the gum, lips pursed together as he waited for her to look at him. Hermione snapped her head to him, seeing the cheeky expression and gasped. “No way! Malfoy! You always do this!” 


  Draco couldn’t help but snicker at the reaction, her pouting and sudden burst reminded him of a child’s tantrum. She was…cute when flustered. 


  “Swimwear is optional at this beach. Why do you think it’s completely warded? Not all tourists want onlookers.” He explained, laughing again when she huffed and crossed her arms. 


  “Well I’m keeping my suit on.” She defiantly said and they approached one of the huts. Draco amusedly shook his head then turned his attention to the man working the hut, giving him a wave and a genuine smile. Hermione thought it was charming how kind he was to his employees, she found it endearing every time he’d chat them up and give them his attention and respect. 


  They were given special bracelets that would let them pass through the wards and alerted the staff what type of guests they were as Draco explained. Hermione assumed that, as an owner, they would be receiving extra special treatment today. Draco mindlessly found Hermione’s hand, interlacing their fingers together and tugging her through the entrance and into the wards. 


  Hermione took in her surroundings, noticing cabanas, umbrella set ups and lounge chairs, there was a main bar where people were sitting at, a small dance floor connected, and of course, people walking along the beach, witches topless, wizards in extremely short suits and those few who decided to be completely bare while lying in their designated area. She couldn’t help but to blush hard and avert her gaze to the white sand and how it contrasted the galactic patterns on Draco’s arm. She made a mental note to ask him about all his tattoos today. 


  Draco looked down at her curly head, face hidden behind her hair and gave her hand a gentle squeeze. “It’s okay to look, everyone that comes here is very friendly.” 


  “I don’t want to make any friends today, I’m okay.” She mumbled into the ground, making Draco chuckle. 


  He brought them to a cabana and led them inside, a double joined lounge chair that almost looked like a bed, two side tables each holding a fruity and colorful drink, a massive bowl of fruit, towels on the chair and a basket with assorted items. 


  Hermione looked down, noticing their hands still connected and awkwardly pulled it away, taking a step forward to inspect the room. It was large, that was to be expected, but very modest nonetheless, something she enjoyed. Turning around to look at him, she crossed her arms over her chest and poked out her hip. 


  “What’s the point of going to a beach and remaining inside the whole time?” 


  Draco smirked and snapped his fingers, the cabana promptly folded itself until it was a neat square, laying on the ground behind their lounge chair. 


  “Better?” 


  Hermione hastily looked around, seeing half naked people lounging many meters away from them and almost asked him to put the cabana back up. But instead she looked him in the eye and lifted her chin up. 


  “Much.” 


  “Thoughts? I’m sure you have a few choice opinions on this place.” Draco walked over to the lounge chair, sitting on the edge and grabbing the slushy drink, he crossed one ankle over the other and brought a hand behind his head, making the muscles on his bicep bulge with the movement. He looked so calm and in his element, pleasantly enjoying himself as if he were on holiday. 


  “It’s…different.” Draco snorted and Hermione narrowed her eyes. “I mean it’s clever, like all the things you do apparently. Though I don’t see why it has to be a nude beach, what’s wrong with a regular one?” 


  Draco sipped his drink and raised a brow. “I market to the culture and an adult age group. And there’s a large market for private beaches here.” 


  Hermione took a seat on the opposite edge as well, moving sand around with her sandal and looking out to the ocean in front of her, Draco’s legs beside her. “So are all your business ventures catered around sex? Seems a little primitive and extremely boyish of you.” 


  “Sex sells. But I’d like to think my businesses offer the chance for individuals to discover something new, take them out of their comfort zone, give them an opportunity to let loose, have fun, find something they enjoy that they normally wouldn’t. Does this all sound familiar?” 


  Hermione looked at him over her shoulder, fighting off a smirk as he winked at her over his drink. She shook her head. 


  “Pompous arse.” She mumbled under her breath, grinning when she heard his laugh, taking pride that she caused it. 


  “Don’t be mad at me because I’m a creative genius. You should be thanking me anyway.” Draco started sitting up and scooting to the edge of the chair where Hermione sat. She leaned back leisurely on her palms. 


  “Oh yeah? Why’s that?” 


  Draco gave her a cheeky look, and leaned back to match her position. He crossed one arm over hers, making their shoulders touch in their rested position. Draco could see the small freckles that dusted over the skin on her nose and cheeks and thought them very appealing. Their faces weren’t too far away, Hermione could make out the flecks of blue in his eyes.


  “Because you’ve liked 
  
    everything
  
   we’ve done so far. You’d be lying if you said differently.” He told her, watching her eyelashes flutter against her cheek. She composed herself and threw him a confident smirk, his stomach tightened at the sight. 


  “I like not having to pay for drinks, clothes or travel costs.” She corrected. 


  “So you’re just using me?” Draco replied, eyes dancing with hers. 


  “Yep.” She had to look away, his face seemed to move closer to hers. She could smell his cologne. 


  “You wound me. Here I thought you might have actually started to enjoy my company.” Draco joked, but something felt slightly truthful in the assessment. He was curious of her answer, knowing she’d give an equally joking response that was safe. 


  “Not at all. Knowing you is convenient so I’m able to exploit your wealth and business, but your presence is hardly pleasurable.” As soon as the word left her mouth, she cursed herself for the choice. She tried to play it off, like the word didn’t affect her, but it certainly affected him. 


  She felt him leaning into her, his lips right at her ear, blowing his warm, minty breath onto her with every exhale, she shivered even in the hot air of Brazil. Her eyes glued on the ocean, too afraid to make any sudden movements. 


  “Hardly pleasurable still implies you find me somewhat pleasurable, Granger.” 


  His voice was dangerously low, she felt it in the pits of her stomach. Her head swayed towards his mouth and she heard him let out a pleased growl before his lips delicately suckled the skin of her lobe, pulling it between his teeth. Suddenly aware they were in public, she pulled back, his lips making a smacking sound as they disconnected from her skin. 


  She gave him a bewildered expression, and for a moment, she thought she saw a pained emotion flash through his eyes. Whatever it was, he quickly covered it with a face that asked her what she was so concerned about, but he already knew the answer. 


  “We’re—sorry we’re just in—“ 


  “Public I’m aware.” Draco finished for her. “We’ve been in public, it hasn’t been a problem before.” He stated but it sounded more like a question. 


  Hermione didn’t know why she reacted so flippantly, he was correct after all. They’ve done more in public than just that, so it shouldn’t be a problem. Maybe it was because Ginny telling her it means something more that he wanted to spend time with her during the day was replaying in her head, and him already trying to make a move proved her theory wrong. And with that realization, it oddly made her sad and feel like a play thing rather than someone he actually wants to spend time with. 


  “But,” Draco cut off her thoughts, “I can keep my hands and mouth to myself. Whatever you want, Granger, just say the word. I am a gentleman you know.” And just like always, he took the lead, surprising her with his ability to make everything feel normal and light hearted when she’d feel unsure of herself. It was a trait she has come to rely on more times than she truly realized. 


  “Only sometimes.” She responded, lips twitching up at him. 


  “Only sometimes.” He agreed and stood up, grabbing the drink left on the table. “Here, try this. Tell me what you think.” 


  Looking at the red and orange slush mixed together in a special glass, she wondered what type of concoction it was. Taking the drink from his hand she brought it up to her mouth, a pleasant combination of multiple citruses hit her taste buds. She licked her lips, loving the way the cool beverage slid down her throat. 


  “Very good, another one of your creations?” She turned her head at the exact moment Draco decided to remove his t-shirt. Her breath caught in her throat, his sculpted body and defined muscles still surprised her. He had uncharacteristically worn swimming trunks that were impossibly short, revealing his upper thigh muscles, clenching with every step, and a see through white T-shirt. She was giddy for the moment he’d finally take it off, and now that he has, she had half a mind to ask him to put it back on and take it off once more. 


  “Yes, an alcoholic beverage made with sun protection. No little bits burning on my beach.” He explained, a small grin on his face. 


  “I assume that you have different drinks for different places and needs, so what else is offered here?” Hermione asked, sliding her sandals off her feet and wriggling her body back a bit so her legs hung off the sides of the chair. 


  “Well, for the beach there’s the sunscreen one that’s our most popular, pepper up potions included in any drink you just have to ask, there’s one that actually soothes sunburns too, it seems my shot creations are the most popular here too as they are in London.” Draco explained as he moved back into an upright lying position. Hermione turned her body, one leg bent under her, her knee brushing against his thigh. 


  “Are you working on anything new now?” She asked as she sipped on her drink and bit into the speared piece of pineapple from the garnish stick. 


  “Possibly, but I can’t share. Don’t want you running off, selling my secrets to my competitors.” 


  “You really are Willy Wonka.” Hermione mused. 


  “Ah right. The chocolate maker from the muggle story. I’ve just gotten to the part where the chubby boy gets stuck in a tube.” Draco said, making Hermione snap her eyes to him. 


  “You—you bought the book?” 


  “Yeah. Was a little curious after you mentioned it to see the similarities. Though I would never have slaves like he does, a little dark for a children’s book.” Draco explained nonchalantly, reaching for a cherry from the fruit bowl next to him. 


  Hermione stared for a moment, still in shock that he would remember her reference and even more so that he was interested enough to find the book. Something warmed in her stomach, a new feeling she couldn’t quite place. She was staring too long at him, he had raised his eyebrows as he asked her what. She just shook her head. 


  “Nothing. How do you like the book so far?” 


  “It’s certainly interesting, the concept is juvenile but it is a children’s book. Willy Wonka seems a bit off though, what’s his deal?” 


  This made her laugh. His skepticism was hilarious considering it was a beloved story by many. “I can’t tell you, just read. The sequel is very interesting if you decide to pursue that too.” 


  “No offense but I think I’ll pass once I’m done with the chocolatier. Don’t know how much child exploitation I can take.” He huffed and Hermione snorted. 


  She was half way done with her drink when Draco sat up and filled it back up to the brim. She gave him a look and he just shrugged as he sat back down. He made some comments about enjoying the day and having fun but she didn’t protest. 


  “I have to admit, I thought this place would have gotten a bigger reaction out of you.” Draco randomly said, eyes scanning the crowd but not particularly landing on anyone for longer than a moment. Hermione looked around, careful to view people’s faces rather than bodies, a challenging task. 


  “Well, though I am somewhat uncomfortable I’ve taken a rather rational approach to all this.” She replied. 


  “Wouldn’t expect anything less, but please share, I’m fascinated.”


  “Well, being at Hogwarts with roommates I obviously saw my fair share of naked bodies. Plus I live with Ginny and she always changes in front of me despite my constant protests.” Hermione laughed. “But everyone is reserved, no one is excessively in my face nor do I have to look so it’s not as bad as I originally thought.” 


  “Pleased to hear.” He told her. “Interesting tidbit about Weasley. Sounds like Blaise and her have a lot in common.” 


  “Are you saying Blaise has a hard time keeping his clothes on as well?” Hermione was stifling a giggle. Draco closed his eyes and recalled a memory. 


  “If there were ever parties in the dungeons and Blaise was dared to strip, he’d do it without hesitation. It kind of became his thing. Even now when I go to visit him sometimes he’s just walking around his house stark naked. It’s unnerving how little he cares about it sometimes.” Draco told her, making them both laugh. 


  “Sounds exactly like Ginny.” 


  “Have to say I wasn’t too surprised they were matched from that dating service. He’s harbored a crush for some time.” 


  Hermione looked at him with a furrowed brow. Blaise had said the same thing when she first saw him at the Cherry Pit. She found it hard to believe, but Draco confirming it was equally strange to hear. 


  “Yeah he said that to me. When did this ‘crush’ even start?” Hermione had uncurled her leg from under her body, feeling the ligament begin to tingle with numbness. She slid back more, but still didn’t lean her whole body back against the chair like Draco’s, still wanting some type of distance between them. 


  “Mm, I’d say before her and golden boy broke up. He’d talk about her team all the time and somehow wind in a snide comment about how she was with him. Then once they broke up he said something that just gave him away. He eventually found out she was trying that dating service so he signed up for it as well. He went on five dates before Weasley, and never even stayed long enough for it to be considered a real date. He kept hoping they’d match and eventually they did. He’s quite pathetic actually.” 


  Hermione stared in awe at the explanation and wondered if Blaise had told Ginny of his crush before they started dating. She thought the pining was somewhat sweet, a little odd yes, but sweet nonetheless. 


  “That’s…kind of romantic. But why didn’t he just ask her out in person?” Hermione’s face felt extremely warm and she looked down at her drink, already half gone again. Damn Malfoy for being an insanely good mixologist. Even with her hair up she could feel sweat begin to form on her neck. 


  Draco rolled his eyes at the question. “Granger, he liked her. Despite Blaise’s reputation, if he’s around a girl he likes, he becomes a stuttering fool and is hardly the ladies man people know him to be. Pathetic like I said.” 


  Hermione giggled, finding out the Slytherin that appeared to be so charming and confident around her best friend was the cutest thing. “Well that’s very sweet, no matter what you think.” 


  “I’ll be sure to tell Blaise that he’s charmed yet another Gryffindor. Un-bloody-believable.” He huffed, stretching his neck higher, attempting to get closer to the sun.


  She was feeling loose, her drink almost finished and her cheeks felt excessively warm from the weather. She eyed Malfoy, body relaxed, face calm, slow rises and falls of his defined stomach and chest. What the hell, she was supposed to relax, she couldn’t do that if she was sweaty in her clothes. She rose from the couch, and crossed her arms over the tank top she wore and removed it. She shimmied out of her denim shorts and immediately felt better. 


  Draco watched with a dry mouth as she revealed the red swimsuit she chose to wear. He’d never admit it out loud, but he thought red may be his new favorite color, only if she wore it though. Her bikini was strapless, her bottoms tied on the side and he desperately regretted the no camera policy he enforced on his beach, he’d give anything for a picture of Granger laying in the sand in that tiny red bikini. 


  To his surprise she sat down beside him, shoulders bumping into him as she got comfortable and grabbed her drink. Her cheeks were a blossoming pink and her eyes seemed a little glossy, she must be feeling the alcohol. He smiled to himself, happy she was easing into the environment and to him. 


  “I’ve been meaning to ask what the password is at the Cherry Pit in Paris. I couldn’t remember all you said.” She said, mouth looking for the straw on her nearly empty drink.


  “Why? Thinking of going without me to see Yvonne?” Draco responded with a smirk, something dark glinted in his eyes as well. Hermione blushed and found herself stuttering over her words. 


  “N-no. I was just…curious.” Hermione said, eyes focused down at the way their thighs were touching. 


  “The password is actually a question. Nonmembers are given the answer to the question and if they can figure out the password, then they are allowed entry.” He explained, reaching beside him for a cherry. 


  “So what’s the answer?” Hermione asked, watching as he plucked the stem off the fruit. Draco smirked and placed the stem in his mouth. 


  “
  
    With your tongue.
  
  ” He stated, and she watched his jaw move, the smirk remained and she pondered the answer. 


  With your tongue. With your tongue. Oh Merlin.


  “How do you knot a cherry stem?” She questioned, making Draco smile, revealing the knotted stem between his teeth. He pulled it away and placed it in the bowl. 


  “Brightest witch of her age strikes again.” 


  “That was easy.” She responded, head turning to the ocean. 


  “It’s not meant to stump anybody but I’m glad you know the password, now you just have to learn it in French.” 


  “You’ll have to teach me how to say it.” Hermione told him, closing her eyes.


  “Done.” 


  “And how to tie a cherry stem.” She said, slightly smirking to herself as he grew silent. Peaking one eye open as she felt him shift beside her, she watched him grab two cherries and sit up. Hermione moved up the chair, sitting higher against it. 


  “I don’t think it’ll be hard for you.” He held out one cherry to her as he bit his own off the stem. Eyeing him, she took the cherry from his fingers and stuck out her tongue before enclosing her lips around it and pulling it off the stem, attempting to make a show out of it. Draco stared, his eyes drawn to her lips, shuddering at the memory of her doing something similar to his cock. His member jumped and he unabashedly reached down to adjust himself as he met her eyes. She looked down at his doings then back up to him, caught off guard by his audacity, he smiled. 


  Draco placed his own stem in his mouth and motioned for Hermione to do the same. They watched each other, appearing to engage in a little friendly competition. Hermione’s eyes widened when Draco pulled the knotted stem out of his mouth already and focused harder on trying to get the task done. She could feel the knot, but she just needed to pull it taut before it unraveled in her mouth. 


  She hesitantly pushed the stem out of her mouth, holding it between her teeth as she triumphantly smiled at Draco, showing her accomplishment. He grinned at her excitement but leaned forward and Hermione almost dropped the stem from her mouth. He captured the other end, taking it in his teeth and pulled back slightly, she could feel his breath on her face, their eyes locked on each other. Satisfied with himself and the reaction he received, Draco released the stem but didn’t pull his face away. 


  “It was perfect, just needed to be a little…tighter.” 


  Hermione looked down at his lips, cherry stem forgotten as it fell onto her chest. Draco leaned down and captured her lips in a dizzying kiss. Their fruity tasting tongues danced together, both seeking control. She sighed into his mouth and her hands found his hair, needing to mess it up. Draco’s hand rested on her upper thigh, fingers toying with the strings keeping her bottom together. She suddenly snatched his hand away and pulled from his mouth, giving him the most serious expression she could muster in her buzzed haze. 


  “I will not be going nude Draco Malfoy. I don’t care how many unbelievably delicious drinks you give me.” She told him and he tilted his head back to laugh, the sound making her chest spasm with warmth. He hand remained on her thigh, and she thought this must have been the first time it didn’t feel excessively cold. 


  “We’ll see about that. Let’s finish our pitchers and see how you feel after, eh?” He smirked and Hermione slapped him on the bicep, emitting another laugh from him. He moved away, reaching his arm behind his head and moving his hand closest to her to rest on her thigh. He shut his eyes, grin keeping over his features. 


  “Oh, Granger, you're too fun.” He told her, giving her thigh a squeeze. She tried to calm the erratic beating of her heart and not pay attention to the possessive gesture. She settled back into her chair, ultimately reaching to give herself a half pour of her beverage and relaxing under the sun. 


  “And you’re vile.” She joked, attempting to sound serious. 


  “Yeah, but you’re still having fun.” He shot back, and she stayed quiet, definitely not responding. He peaked an eye open and moved his hand up again, pulling one of the strings on her bottoms. “Aren’t you?” He challenged once more, his hand earning a slap. 


  “Yes you prat I am. Now stop trying to undress me.” Draco’s hand defeatedly moved back to her thigh. 


  “Your slap is as hard as I remember Granger.” He said and she chortled into her drink. 


  “Guess some things never change, Malfoy.” She cheekily said. 


  “And some things do.” He grinned, again peeking at her with one eye. She found herself giving him a different smile, it was thankful and happy. Draco mirrored it and a silent moment passed between them. 


  When their pitchers were empty, Draco had called for the wait staff to bring over lunch. They were both inebriated, but not excessively drunk, just a good happy drunk, one that made you feel happy to be alive. They ate their empanadas and salad, sitting at opposite ends of the couch chair which was extended to mimic a bed, and discussed Draco’s tattoos.


  “So what are those flowers, they cover your entire forearm.” She gestured to the arm that held his dark mark. He looked down, a solemn expression growing over his face as he spoke. 


  “Daffodils, symbolizes new life, new beginnings. Thought it was fitting to get it on this arm.” He explained, looking at the large flowers that flawlessly meshed into his fading dark mark. Hermione looked at his arm, the flowers were more noticeable than his dark mark, they were bold and the thick black lines drew attention to it’s dainty detail. They were truly beautiful. 


  “I like them. I think they may be my favorite piece.” She told him honestly. Their eyes flashed to each other, holding their gaze as something wordlessly was exchanged between them. Understanding, acceptance, forgiveness and more. Draco was the first to look away, reaching to finish his water and Hermione put her plate away off to the side. The food helped her buzz, making her still feel happy but more focused. 


  “Are you going to get any others? Maybe one in color?” She asked, leaning back on her palms. 


  “Not in color, I like black and gray. And possibly, maybe on my chest or my back, or leg, haven’t decided yet.” He explained. 


  “What would you get?” 


  “A snake.” He grinned like a child and Hermione playfully rolled her eyes. 


  “Of course.” 


  “I am who I am.” He snickered at her. 


  “Well why not get a bright red cherry? Seems prominent in your life.” 


  Draco raised his eyebrows at her and seriously considered her suggestion. His eyes looked up to his forehead and he bobbed his head from side to side. “Not a bad suggestion.” 


  “That would be interesting to see, a cherry paired with all your dark and meaningful tattoos.” She laughed, thinking it would throw off his entire aesthetic.


  Draco sat for a minute, mind buzzing with possibilities and wondered if she would bite his bait. 


  “Tell you what, I’ll get the cherry tattoo.” He told her and Hermione smiled. 


  “Really?” 


  “Absolutely.” Draco crawled over to her and Hermione sat frozen with wide eyes. His large hands gripped her waist and yanked her down to where he sat, body slid into his, legs lazily thrown over his thighs as his hands stroked them up and down. “If you take a little topless swim with me.” 


  She gasped and smacked him on the arm and tried wriggling away. Draco of course laughed, and only tightened his arms around her as she turned her body off him. “No, absolutely not you prick! Just get the bloody tattoo. I don’t even care that much.” 


  She had successfully turned her body but it had unfortunately made it easier for him to pin her to the lounge couch face down, his fingertips digging into her sides made her gasp out a laugh, the feeling tickled. 


  “Hermione, come on.” He chuckled, noticing she was giggling and squirming under his touch. “One little swim.”


  “You take your bottoms off and I might.” She challenged back. 


  “But I’m already half naked.” He protested and she groaned as his comment, he laughed, again, bloody prat. 


  Draco was essentially laying on top of her, his hips pinned hers down and he slightly leaned up so he wouldn’t crush her chest. With her excess wiggling, her behind was rubbing up against his front, unbeknownst to her it appeared, and he was beginning to grow stiff. He grabbed her forearms, the only part of her body she could move was her lower half. 


  “Granger if you keep squirming I’ll be forced to ask you to assist with the trouble you’ve grown.” His voice came out in a huff against her ear and he grinded his hips against her arse, making her stop all her movements when she felt his growing arousal. She blushed and remained silent, a part of her bold mind told her to move against him, just to see what would happen, but another part of her told her that would be opening a door she wasn’t sure if she could close. 


  She stayed still and listened to his breathing for a moment. He traced the outside shell of her ear with his nose, the sensation making her eyes fall shut. “I really need to cool off now, want to join?” 


  “Only if I get to keep my top on.” She sternly told him and she could feel him smile. 


  “Whatever you want.” 


  He pushed himself off her and she turned over, watching his hand shamelessly adjust his lower region to hide the growing erection, she blushed again, or maybe it was just the heat of the afternoon sun. Rising from the chair, Hermione worriedly looked at their belongings. 


  “Should we put a protective charm on our things?” She asked, stepping to him as Draco already turned to walk the short distance to the shoreline. 


  “No need, there’s an invisible boundary line that activates when our bracelets are too far away. Our items will be safe.” He explained, pointing to the bracelets on their hands. 


  “Brilliant.” Hermione expressed and Draco smiled as their feet padded on the wet sand. 


  “You say that a lot when I tell you the added measures I’ve put into my businesses.” He observed, they slowly walked into the water, waves crashing into their shins. 


  “Well you continuously impress me, so I think it should be noted.” 


  “As do you Granger.” Malfoy told her, looking down at her and throwing a wink, she shook her head. 


  When the waves seemed to come up to Hermione’s chest they decided to dive in, the salty water refreshing for their bodies and mind. Hermione felt the effects of the alcohol slowly wear off after she ate and now she was almost completely sober. Draco popped to the surface and blew water out of his face before rubbing his hands through his hair. Hermione stared at him, in awe of how beautiful he was. 


  Draco walked them in a bit, so they could both kneel in the water without the waves crashing over their heads. Of course they argued about Hermione going topless once more. 


  “You are insufferable.” 


  “Look I’m just saying you’ve done a lot of momentous things, what’s going topless in the water when no one can even see you?” He fired back. 


  “It’s getting out of the water where people can see me.” She explained yet again. 


  “There’s no cameras allowed on the beach and no one here knows you. You’ll just be another young witch enjoying the feeling of being nude like the rest of em.” 


  “Malfoy, no stop asking.” She chuckled and splashed some water into his face, earning her a pout. Draco looked back to where their space was then back to Hermione. 


  “How about, you take off your top, walk to the shoreline and when we’re completely out of the water you can hop on my back and I’ll carry you the ten meters back to our stuff. I’ll put up the cabana so you can put it on in privacy.” 


  “Or I can just keep it on.” The waves pushed Hermione slightly forward and Draco’s hands steadied her hips underwater. 


  “What if I take off my swim trunks, will you do it then?” He offered and Hermione felt her breath leave her before she busted out a loud laugh. She nearly toppled over in the water from laughing so hard at the notion. 


  “W-would you really?” She giggled, holding onto her stomach as it cramped from laughing so hard. She couldn’t even fathom the idea of a tall and brooding, former death eater walking butt naked on his own beach. Draco smirked and let go of her hips to reach for his own and pushed down his swimming trousers. He nearly fell into the waves but successfully removed them rather gracefully and held up the soaking pair above water for her to see. Hermione’s smile vanished and her mouth hung open. 


  “You can’t be serious.” She said. 


  “Dead serious. Now come on. Your turn.” He told her and she paled. “Hermione you won’t even be fully naked, plus, you’ll be covered once you get on my back. Just enlighten me. This is a first for me too.” 


  “Really?” She asked disbelievingly, it was his own beach, his 
  
    nude 
  
  beach and he’s never even gone naked before?


  “Yes. This will be my first time walking around naked on my own beach so it’ll be a first for both of us. Live a little with me.” He requested, unoccupied hand coming out of the water to rest on the back of her neck. She stared into his eyes, a strange feeling of trust rushed through her. He had yet to be wrong about the things they’ve done together, why would now be different? He teased instead of pushed, joked instead of making her feel insecure, she trusted him more than she originally realized. 


  Letting out a sigh, she kneeled deeper into the water and pulled her bikini top over her head. Draco patiently waited, face neutral as he quietly let her discard her top. Her body shivered as the water rushed to the newly exposed skin, she could feel her nipples harden under the contact and shyly looked back up to Draco’s expectant face. 


  “Such a Gryffindor.” He said, the corner of his mouth betraying what used to be an insult.


  “What did you say earlier, ‘I am who I am?’” She threw back at him and he rolled his eyes. 


  “Are you ready then?” He asked eyebrows raised on his forehead and she took a long breath before nodding. 


  “Ready as I’ll ever be.” 


  Draco stood up first and Hermione looked away, her cheeks were uncommonly hot and she couldn’t believe she agreed to do this. She could quickly put her top back on but then she’d feel cheated out of an experience, one her and Malfoy were sharing together. It shouldn’t have mattered that much to her but it did and so, she stood up and looked around before crossing her arms over chest. 


  “You don’t get to cross your arms, I’m not hiding anything.” He told her as he took a step towards the shore. Hermione kept her eye straight on their chair, willing her gaze not to wander anywhere else. 


  “Yes and I’m sure Blaise would be proud.” She replied, earning a little chuckle from him. 


  “No one is paying attention, look for yourself.” He pointed to people in the water, completely naked, minding their own business, then to others on the shore walking in the shallowness of the water, and finally to people sitting on their own chairs sunbathing. He was right, curse him for always being right. 


  “Come on Granger, I have to say it’s a little thrilling. Don’t tell Blaise.” He joked, and Hermione felt herself grin and shake her hand. He stopped walking and brushed his fingers against her hip, making her stop walking as well. She looked up and Draco made sure his eyes stayed on her shining brown ones. His hand plucked away an arm, uncrossing her defense, she wordlessly allowed him to intertwine their fingers, both of them on display at the beach. 


  “Not so bad, see.” He said quietly and Hermione saw the reflections of blue in his eyes from the ocean. The colors were warm and reassuring. 


  “I suppose.” She mumbled and allowed him to lead them forward to the shoreline. There truly wasn’t anyone paying attention, not even a glance in their direction. It was somewhat...disappointing but she supposed that’s exactly what she wanted. She unconsciously squeezed Draco’s hand every so often, and though she was unaware, it would make him smile a bit. 


   As they approached closer to the shore, Hermione figured she could make it another ten meters to their stuff, it wasn’t that bad after all. Draco didn’t even ask if she wanted to be carried, he saw the look of confidence on her face and knew she was alright. 


  Draco had grabbed his wand, needing to bend over to do so which gave Hermione a perfect view of his pasty and plump arse. It was rather good looking and she wanted to smack herself for ogling his bare behind. He casted a spell that put the cabana back up, giving them privacy to put their suits back on. But as soon as the tent went up, Draco snatched her top out of her hands. 


  “Hey! What are you doing!?” Hermione shrieked as she tried to grab her top back and pay attention to his nakedness. 


  “I think we should stay like this for the remainder of the day.” Draco said while holding her top above his head, suppressing a grin as he watched her frown and a fire of anger rise behind her chocolate brown eyes. 


  “No. You said once we’re back at the cabana!” She cried, attempting to jump to grab at his hand, making him laugh. 


  “My god you’re short.” He said, ignoring her protests and kept his arm raised out of her reach.


  “And you’re an arse! Give me my top!” She demanded and jumped again, smacking his arm down but still not grabbing the suit. 


  “No, I don’t think I will.” He chuckled. 


  “Malfoy!” 


  “Granger!” He fired back, making her huff in frustration. 


  “Stop being so bloody childish and give me my damn suit!” She demanded, a small chuckle rising out from her sentence, betraying her anger.


  “Say please.” He requested.


  “Please?” Hermione said in a sarcastic, bratty tone.


  “Nope, didn’t sound genuine.” He teased, trying to push her back with his other arm. Finding it hilarious how tiny and therefore, easy it was to push her away. 


  “Malfoy if you don’t give me my suit right now—“ 


  “You’ll what Granger? Kick my shins? Cause that’s all you can reach?” He joked, making Hermione angrily gasp and slap his bicep. 


  “Malfoy I swear!” She nearly screamed, trying not to laugh as his fingers lightly pinched her sides. 


  “Reach for it, come on!” He laughed as she jumped poorly. 


  Hermione was panting from her efforts, a stupid silly grin gracing her lips when her feet hit the sand and she realized his arm was wrapped around her back. Her own arm was still outstretched, clawing at his forearm but the other sat on his shoulder. Their stomachs were touching, chests moving together, bodies entirely pressed to feel every inch of each other’s skin. 


  Their smiles slowly disappeared as they stared at each other, mouths open, small pants tangling together. Hermione felt her lower region clench when she became aware of his semi-hard erection pressed into her. Their tent seemed to have raised ten degrees, or maybe it was just her skin that felt on fire. Their eyes flickered down to each other’s lips in the same moment, and then flashed back up to meet before they crashed into each other in a blinding and ferocious kiss. 

  
    Chapter Text
    
  Their eyes flickered down to each other’s lips in the same moment, and then flashed back up to meet before they crashed into each other in a blinding and ferocious kiss. 


  Hermione’s hands slid to his neck, desperately pulling him closer as his arms wrapped around her back, hugging her naked flesh to him. Their mouths consumed each other, licking and sucking at anything. It was needy, raunchy and completely felt like they’ve been deprived of each other for years.


  Draco’s tongue licked hers with every motion of their kiss, making Hermione push herself closer to him, needing more contact than what he was giving. His hands tangled into the wet, messy curls on her head, holding her in place so he could over power her mouth. She’d moan and sigh into his mouth, gasp when his erection pressed on her stomach and whimper when he’d bite her lip. 


  He walked them to the edge of the lounger chair, softly pushing Hermione backwards until she fell into the padded cushion. He stood over her, eyes hungry with lust, lips red from her bruising kisses. She could hear him growl as he kneeled over her, hands tearing at her bottom piece like it was the most frustrating thing in the world to him. He leaned over to kiss her the same time he easily inserted two of his long digits into her sex. She cooed into his mouth and harshly pulled back. 


  “Wait cast a silencing charm.” She panted as his fingers increased their pace, his mouth attached to her neck. 


  “No need.” He mumbled kissing the sensitive area he bruised with his teeth. “Silencing charms are woven into the fabric of the cabana, they work as soon as the cabanas go up, sealing all noises in.” He finished his explanation by licking a line down to the crevice of her breasts.


  “Bloody brilliant man you are.” She expressed, nearly crying from the attention he was giving her nipples. 


  “You’ve mentioned that once or twice.” He told her, licking her right nipple with precision. His fingers curled inside her as he pumped, making her shamelessly moan and buck her hips into his hand. There was already a bundle or pressure ready to be released, and Draco smiled into her other nipple as he lightly bit it, feeling her walls tighten around his fingers. He removed them from her center and covered her nipples with her own arousal. Her eyes watched as his face contorted into dark and pure pleasure. He leaned down and lapped at his creation


  “Fuck Hermione,” he groaned as he brought his tongue over the taut pink nipple, “taste fucking delicious.” 


  She groaned at his words and actions, completely mad with the pleasure he was giving. Her hips grinded up into the air, calling for his hands, or mouth or anything. He complied and lifted her hips off the couch, hooking her legs over his shoulder before diving his tongue over her center. She cried out, almost embarrassingly loud if she could have cared in that moment. 


  Draco’s tongue licked her center like it was his last meal, his fingers pumping into her as his other held her thigh over him. His mouth was drenched with her brand, his nose and tongue tasting the salty yet tangy flavor of her, it was maddening. 


  “God, you’re going—“ she moaned loudly when his fingers worked faster and his throat bubbled out a moan into her center, vibrating directly onto her clit. “Yes, keep going Draco, please.” 


  She was delirious, half her back was hanging in the air as he ate her out. Her stomach tightened, her toes began to curl as her muscles felt like they were going to burst. His lips sucked harder on her clit, pulling the bud into his mouth as his fingers massaged her g spot. She began to see white through her closed eyes. 


  “Right there! Yes…yes! Fuck!” 


  Her climax washed over her body, making her center convulse around his fingers, he torturously continued to pump and moan into her as she rode out her high. He unhooked her legs from his shoulders and her lower half collapsed onto the couch, Draco pushed himself down into the sand and spread her legs apart, apparently not finished with her just yet. 


  He licked down the length of her center until his tongue just grazed the skin under it, her whole body twitched and he continued to collect the remnants of her orgasm until there were tears in her eyes and she was begging him to stop. 


  “Please, Malfoy. I-I can’t handle anymore.” She reached down for his hair, trying to pull him up towards her. He complied and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand before kissing her deeply, giving her a taste of herself. They kissed for awhile, hands groping and fondling until her hips were rotating against his, his dick sliding through her folds much like the week prior. 


  When the tip of him slightly slipped into her, making them both groan out a most pleasuring moan, Draco’s gray eyes snapped open, his hands smoothing back the curls that were stuck to her face from the humidity and water. His nose brushed into hers, foreheads barely caressing as they held each other’s stare. 


  “Is this alright?” He asked, just barely pushing his length forward to stretch her opening out and she quickly gave short nods. 


  Draco painstakingly pushed his cock into her. The slick center welcomed him like an old friend, her walls delightfully squeezed him, pulling him into her until there was no space left between their bodies. Draco let out a raspy swear and Hermione enjoyed his thickness stretching her out, a small burn that slowly transformed into a feeling of pure bliss. There wasn’t a comparable feeling to describe it. 


  He held himself inside her, teeth nipping at her neck as she felt him stretch her. He didn’t move until her hips grinded up, needy for some movement. He thrusted forward, rocking her entire body up the couch and he had to hold her body against his to keep her in place. 


  The feeling of her around him was hot white fire. She was entirely too wet and somehow the perfect amount of tightness that gripped him like a vice. She was suffocating him, her scent, her hair, her smile and her body, he was drowning in her, and he didn’t dare ask to be saved. 


  “Waited, 
  
    fuck
  
  , so long to feel you.” He groaned into her neck, snapping his hips forward at a steady pace, listening to her moans to tell him how well he was giving her pleasure. “Wanna make you come again.” 


  Hermione’s nails dug into his back, she tried to match his thrusts but his rhythm was too quick and she couldn’t focus when his tip was rubbing into her sensitive walls. Her feet hooked around his calves and she bit down on his shoulder, moaning like she never has before. 


  “Fuck yes.” She hissed and he brought their mouths together, one hand holding onto her face, fingers digging into her cheek as their lips crazily meshed together. His hands moved under her, firmly holding her hips. 


  In a quick motion, Draco removed himself and launched himself onto his back, taking Hermione with him until she clumsily fell on top of him. He grunted when her knee punctured his thigh. 


  “I’m sorry.” She sheepishly said and he only chuckled and grabbed at her hips while she adjusted over him. 


  “It’s okay, come here.” He commanded and she leaned down to kiss him, more innocently than their fast and urgent ones. He welcomed her lips with a heated embrace, opening his mouth for her, massaging her lips and tongue in a way that made her toes curl. 


  He reached down behind her and took himself into his hand, angling his tip to her opening. Hermione pulled away from his lips and pushed her hips back until her center engulfed him. They let out heated gasps and Hermione steadied her hands on his chest, head rolling back onto her shoulders as she accommodated his size in the new position. He moved his thighs up, making her body bounce on his length once which caused a sharp gasp to leave her throat. 


  His hands were placed on her naked waist, rubbing his cold palms up and down her sides to completely relax her. She attempted moving her hips forward, causing a spark of white light to flash through her mind and into her center. Both of their eyes rolled back and Draco firmly took hold of her body, thrusting into her to begin the most sensational pleasure either had experienced. 


  She snapped her hips forward at a slow pace but soon found a steady rhythm that made their hearts beat faster and breaths come out in heavy pants and moans. Draco was seeing stars, the witch above him too captivating to close his eyes. She was everywhere and he didn’t want to miss a moment. 


  Hermione grinded her hips down particularly hard, her nails scraped into his skin when he hit her most sensitive spot. She cried out, her hair flowing down her back when she tipped her head up into the sky. She repeated the motion, the tip of him hitting the same spot, making a small fire build in her stomach again.


  “Oh yes. 
  
    Yes.” 
  
  She whispered, her eyes floating close at the feeling, her mind not focused on anything but finding her high he was bringing to her in a short amount of time. 


  “Look at me Hermione.” Draco commanded and thrusted up the same time she snapped her hips down. She wailed, so close to her end. Her eyes lazily opened and she found his primitive stare, nearly moaning at the sight itself. “I want to see your face when you come on my cock.” 


  She moaned again, her center tightening around him and Draco evilly smirked at her. “Fuck, you’re so good, taking all of me.” He reached down to her center, thumb lightly circling her clit, she felt her body go hot. 


  Draco was harshly grunting, burying himself deep inside of her to a hilt with every thrust to match her own. His resolve was slipping, her breathy moans not helping him hold on for much longer. She felt so, so good, fitting him like a tight glove and beckoning him deeper.


  “Fuck! Oh, oh gods.” She whined, his thick cock hit her g spot over and over, his thumb worked her to a collapse. 


  “Cunt is gripping me.” Draco groaned, nearing his own release as he felt her walls flutter around him. “So good, so fucking 
  
    hot.” 
  


  “I’m-I’m right, oh, there, oh fuck.” She looked down at him nearly in tears, her body screamed for a release. The feeling of his cock stroking her walls was bringing her to her end.


  “Say my name when you come on my cock.” He commanded, one hand snaking up to pinch her nipple. “Tell me whose cock you’re riding.” 


  “Yes, Draco, 
  
    yes!”
  


  “Fuck, oh 
  
    FUCK
  
  , oh gods Granger!”


  His hips pounded up into her as Hermione convulsed around him, her body felt doused in fire as her orgasm rained down on her. Her center milked him as he shot into her, feeling him pulse as he came. She panted heavily, whines and whimpers of random words and pleas escaping her lips as her center repeatedly clenched down on him. Her body was completely at his mercy, her skin so sensitive to his touch that when his hands lightly traced a pattern down her arm, she felt the last pulse of her orgasm release from her body. 


  Draco felt his legs shake, his chest rapidly rising and falling, his back clammy with a small sheet of sweat. His head was resting against the couch, vision slightly blurry as he tried to focus on the witch above him. She had her eyes closed, probably trying to contain her own pants. He reached up and placed his palm against her cheek, she naturally leaned into him, making him softly smile. Her eyes opened, a bright and playful fire behind them as she sent him a personal smile.


  She couldn’t understand how Draco has made her feel so completely confident and secure. She had never felt so sexually free and charged, her whole demeanor was changing, blossoming into an extravagant flower vibrant with color that screamed, look at me, she loved it. 


  Her hands gently scratched down his chest and she sighed heavily, still leaning into his palm. Her eyes centered on his, silence passing over them as they comprehended the experience they just shared. Soft touches didn’t match who they were, but Hermione would concern herself with it later. 


  After some time, Hermione removed him from inside her but remained on his lap. His arms stroked her sides and she watched as the dragon on his arm moved with his muscles. 


  “I think I need another swim.” She spoke first and Draco gave out an amused huff. 


  “Topless?” He quirked a brow at her. 


  “Mm. Possibly.” She entertained. 


  “Yeah?” He grinned, fingertips brushing the underside of her breasts. 


  “Mhm. I think it would be refreshing.” Her own hands moving down to rest lazily on his abs before pushing herself off him completely. She sourgified herself and her dirty bottoms before tying them on her hips again. Draco rose up on his elbows, eyes trailing over her body with a small smirk on his lips.


  “Ever surprising. You are too much fun, Granger.” He told her and she threw his now clean shorts at him. Smiling when they hit him in his face. 


  “Yeah, you’ve mentioned that once or twice.” She mimicked his words from earlier and shot him a wink before disappearing out their cabana, strolling topless to the ocean and not waiting for a stunned Draco to catch up. She was just in the shallow water when his arms threw her over his shoulder, her laughs and screams dying when he submerged them both into the waves. A satisfied looking Draco popped out of the waves, getting a hard shove to the chest before he could speak. 


  Hermione laughed, eyes shut and head tilted towards the sun. She felt relaxed and loose and was totally having fun. She didn’t feel out of her element, in fact, she felt someone rise to the surface that maybe would have never been discovered if it weren’t for Draco Malfoy. An odd thought, but true nonetheless. She’s more confident in her walk, sure of herself in public with the way she dresses and smiles. She was coming into herself and not letting doubts of adulthood creep into her mind any longer. 



  “It’s a genuine question, Hermione. Are we best friends or not?” Ginny pestered and Hermione couldn’t help but cackle at the persistence. 


  “For the final time, I am not telling you how big he was!” She laughed and tried to focus on the work she brought home. 


  Her and Ginny were eating dinner and casually discussing their weeks and what their weekend might look like. Ginny had mentioned Blaise wanted to take her on a holiday once she had a few breaks from practice and traveling. It led to her discussing the places she hoped to visit including beaches in Italy where she dreamed of Blaise touching her every chance he got. Hermione had learned —to her dismay—almost every detail involving the first time her and Blaise had sex, and of course, every time they had sex period. Of course Hermione would protest and beg Ginny to stop or at least not be so graphic but it made her laugh nonetheless. 


  Tonight was no different. Ginny shared a story of the last time Blaise and her had sex which was in the Harpies locker room, and proceeded to ask Hermione more details regarding her and Draco’s sex life, which lead to her inquiring how large his member was. 


  “Hermione come on. Just say when!” Ginny laughed and held her hands out, slowly moving them apart to create a larger distance. Hermione raised her eyebrows when her hands measured out to be the estimated size of his erect penis and Ginny’s hands froze. “Here!?” She yelled, making Hermione laugh.


  “I didn’t say anything.” She smugly responded, focusing on the edits to a draft of a new law. 


  “You didn’t 
  
    not 
  
  say anything either. So this big, really? You lucky witch.” Ginny took her dishes and stood up, beginning to clean. 


  “There used to be a time when we discussed normal things, what happened?” Hermione joked. 


  “That was before we started dating some of the hottest wizards ever.” Ginny called back and Hermione paled. 


  “We’re not dating.” She mumbled, her stomach twisting. 


  “Lets review shall we—“ 


  “Ginny please—“


  “Can’t keep his bloody hands off you, takes you to Paris, takes you to Brazil, bought you dresses, you two have been owling since you got home and he’s coming over tonight with a ‘gift’ for you. Hermione, I may not be as smart as you but that sounds a lot like what Blaise and I are doing, which is dating.” 


  Hermione tried her best to ignore her, a large ball weighed down in her stomach that made her feel sick. She’s got a terrible crush but there was no way to confirm that with Ginny in fear she’ll tell Blaise who will of course relay to Malfoy. She’s been reading too much into their interactions, grasping for straws and signs that will hopefully show her he may have a crush as well instead of just a physical attraction. But all their ventures resulted into something sexual and he owled her cheeky letters instead of random notes. So instead of getting her hopes up, she played it safe and allowed the only thing to grow between them be their physical relationship. 


  “It’s a physical relationship, nothing more. We both understand what we want from each other so can you stop with your romantic little ideals.” Hermione asked, trying her best to hide the hurt and annoyance in her tone by covering it with a half laugh. 


  “Whatever. But if there’s ever a day where it becomes something more I’m screaming ‘I told you so’ in your face.” She joked. 


  “Extremely unlikely to happen but fine.” Hermione shook her head and focused on her edits. Ginny walked to where Hermione was sitting and grabbed her sweater before heading into the floo. 


  “Well I’m off. I’ll be anxious to hear what Malfoy brings you so be ready to divulge 
  
    all
  
   details tomorrow.” She shouted while reaching for floo powder. Hermione didn’t turn around as she called over her shoulder. 


  “Say hi to Blaise for me, have fun!” She yelled and heard the floo go off signaling Ginny had left the apartment to visit Blaise for the night. 


  Hermione leapt out of her chair and hurried into her bathroom, spraying perfume and fixing uncooperative curls. She gargled some mouthwash fast and wondered if she should change from the casual jogging shorts and one of her dad’s old long sleeves. Maybe she should throw on a pair of jeans and a nicer top. She didn’t have time to decide though, the chimes of her doorbell rang through her home and she cursed for not preparing more. 


  She skidded to a halt in front of her door and took a deep breath. Hoping Draco wouldn’t be dressed too handsomely and making her feel like an arse. Hermione opened the door, revealing Malfoy holding a sleek black box under his arm and a smirk tugging at his lips. 


  “Granger, cute shorts.” His eyes happily danced down her legs and she backed up, blushing at the compliment as he strode into the living room. 


  “Thanks.” She paused, overthinking whether or not to ask about his week so far. It seemed personal and through their correspondence, they hardly talked about work, it was more heated messages about memories from Brazil and wondering when they’d be able to meet again to do something similar. “How’s your week been?” 


  She cringed when she saw Draco’s head whip around to her from the corner of her eye as she shut the door. 


  “It’s been busy. I’ll be in Paris for the entirety of next week.” He responded, his eyes bright on her. 


  “Oh.” She sounded oddly deflated by the piece of information. “Is everything okay?” 


  “Oh yes. I’m planning floor renovations for some private rooms and the upper part of the club. We’re in the process of hiring more performers and we go through a three step hiring process.” He explained and she nodded, wanting to ask more questions but not sure if he was interested in sharing. 


  Draco wasn’t sure why she was being so quiet with him, a stark contrast to her attitude from last weekend and even this week through their exchanges. He continued on regardless, thinking maybe she wasn’t sure of what questions to ask regarding his business since she didn’t know much about the ins and outs of it anyways. 


  “So I’ll be meeting with my managers making sure we have all proper permits and then meeting with the contractors. The club will still be up and running since we open at seven anyways so it should only take a week. I can…show you what it’ll look like when it’s finished.” He offered, wanting to see how she reacted to be taken back to his club. 


  Hermione listened and felt her cheeks pull upwards at the thought of going back to the Cherry Pit and seeing Yvonne, a slight flush of her skin joined her smile.


  “Yeah it’d be nice to visit Yvonne.” She lightly teased and made Draco’s mouth part. He licked his lips and pulled the skin in between his teeth. 


  “I’ll make sure she won’t be on the schedule the next time we visit.” He lowly snarled, making Hermione laugh. 


  “She’s your main performer I thought.” 


  “She can go on vacation when we visit then.” 


  She wasn’t sure if he was being serious or joking. His eyes read serious but his face seemed teasing. Hermione shivered, remembering his words when they reached the villa after the club. At the time she wondered if it was theatrics or if he actually meant it, she was now leaning towards maybe he actually meant it. 


  “I’d like to go back when she’s there and to see the renovations.” She casually said, walking to sit on the couch. Draco followed and huffed when he sat down, his large body making the couch sink and Hermione didn’t shift away when his thighs touched hers. It was comfortable. 


  “Maybe.” He mumbled, eyes focused on the box. She lightly smacked his thigh, chuckling at his stubbornness. 


  “Maybe? Draco Malfoy you just asked me.” She argued, not believing how uptight he was being about the situation. 


  “Yeah, yeah and you can go without me since you now know the password and have a friend to go see.” He childishly puffed out his breath and rolled his eyes. 


  “Maybe I will.” She said, crossing her arms and giving him a pointed look. 


  “Do it and you won’t get your surprise.” Draco challenged, eyes narrowing at her face. She looked down at the box and didn’t want to be so tempted by it, but she was.


  “What even is it?” She questioned. 


  “You can open it after you promise not to go to Paris again unless it’s with me.” He told her. 


  “Oh Merlin Malfoy. I promise.” She reached for the box but he snatched it away from her grasp and raised his eyebrows. “What? Would you like an unbreakable vow?” 


  “Are you offering?” He said, lips tight in a grin, now Hermione rolled her eyes and he chuckled. He set the box down on their laps, hands sprawled over the top. “Fine. I should explain though, I bought these while we were in Paris. And I thought you should have them.” 


  Hermione swallowed as her mind already knew what the gift was. He slowly lifted up the cover and her eyes widened at the items inside. 


  “Before you go off on me, I just thought it would be a fun idea. The clothes are yours but, I just remembered the way you held your head high despite your nerves that night, it was one of the most attractive things I’ve ever seen a witch do.” Draco explained as Hermione reached inside the box, holding up a camera in one hand and a baby blue corset in the other. Her face felt warm and the air felt too thick to breathe in properly, she couldn’t meet his eyes. 


  “I thought maybe…you needed a reminder of how beautiful and sexy you looked that night. In case you ever doubted that you aren’t.” His voice was low and she could detect small traces of uncertainty. 


  He brought over a camera and two sets of lingerie, implying that she, or maybe he, would take pictures of herself dressed up, for her to keep and hold on to if she ever needed ‘a reminder’ of her beauty. Her throat felt dry and there were hundreds of thoughts racing through her mind. 


  “Have you—have you done this before?” She asked, eyebrows furrowed as she thought about how planned out this seemed. It made her feel uneasy and somewhat sad if this wasn’t the first time he’d suggested or done this with another witch. 


  “No!” Draco’s eyes widened and Hermione almost flinched at the volume. He coughed and awkwardly waved his hands. “No. I um, Theo—he mentioned something to me and Blaise, about a similar thing he’s down with a witch and…and I just thought…well maybe it would be fun. Now I realize I sound like an assuming arse. Sorry, I’ll just—“ He fumbled over his explanation, his ears turning pink and cloudy eyes unable to meet her inquisitive ones. Draco moved to take the items from her hands and shut the box to hastily leave, but Hermione pulled back and didn’t allow him to take the items away. 


  “It’s…an interesting activity.” She stated, and watched as Draco’s throat bobbed while he swallowed. She set the camera down on the table and looked at the other piece of lingerie. It was a busty body suit, a dark emerald green that was solely mesh and lace. Her stomach flipped as she examined the intricate patterns on both pieces, Draco patiently waited, watching her eyes and fingers trace over the fabric. 


  Deep brown eyes shot up to his face. “You’d be taking the photos? Is this your camera?” 


  Draco’s demeanor changed, his confident and charming self came to surface as he realized she was contemplating obliging him for the night. He licked his lips and his eyes seemed to lower. Chilly hands removed the box from their laps, Hermione felt her breath hitch when he threw one hand over the back of the couch and the other on her thigh, making goosebumps immediately rise to the surface of her skin. 


  “Bought it just for you.” He told her and she eyed the camera. 


  “It’s a muggle camera. A Polaroid.” She said, explaining as if it meant something to him. Draco slowly nodded. 


  “I was told it doesn’t need to be taken in to develop. Perfect pictures ready in seconds.” His hand gently moved up and down, she stared for a second at the movement. 


  “And, you’d be taking the photos?” She asked once more, feeling his other hand play with the ends of her hair. His silver eyes flashed, daunting and possessive. 


  “If you’d like.” He purred. Hermione looked at the camera and the box, her chest surging with excitement and wonder. The experience sounded rather hot and she imagined what Malfoy would be like if she were to parade around her home in trampy outfits as he snapped pictures that would immortalize the moment. Her nipples hardened as a shiver ran through her body. 


  She took a shuddering breath and sucked on her lip, gaze meeting Malfoy’s darkened eyes. 


  “Okay, which one first?” She said, her voice just above a whisper. Draco’s jaw twitched and he reached for the box, placing it in her lap once more. 


  “The blue one, save the green for last.” 


  Hermione looked up, a knowing look on her face. “Have a little fantasy of me in green?” 


  Draco’s eyes twinkled, his tongue running over his teeth. “Absolutely.” He stood from the couch and picked up the camera. “Take as much time as you need to get ready.” Draco headed in the direction of her room and Hermione looked down at the clothes in the box before forcing her body to move from the couch and head into the bathroom. 


  She wasn’t nearly as nervous as she was in Paris. She knew the effect she had on Draco in clothing like this and couldn’t wait to see his reaction while in different sets in the comfort of her own home. Would he speak to her and tell her how to pose, would he find himself speechless, or would the camera be forgotten as he’d be too eager to touch her this time? Hermione felt her confidence soar and she happily pulled on the first outfit. 


  The blue corset was silk, criss cross ties in the back that she charmed to tighten and tie into a bow. There were wires that ran through the corset and into a bra, keeping her breasts perky and almost spilling out of itt. The knickers were silk as well, tied together on her sides. It felt comfortable and cool on her body, the material was airy and and shimmered under the light. Hermione wanted to do her makeup but she didn’t feel like waiting or being patient, so she gave herself a once over, throwing her curls over her back and smiled at her reflection. Draco had impeccable lingerie taste for her. 


  She stepped out of the bathroom, walking the few steps to her bedroom, seeing the door partly shut. Pushing the door open with her palm, she saw the bedroom completely dark, only light coming through was from the living room, which, to her unknown knowledge, illuminated her to appear like an apparition in the doorway. 


  Draco sat on the ottoman at the foot of her bed, camera beside him as he casually leaned back. His mouth opened when he saw her, ready to compliment but no sound came out. He was absolutely stunned. Her body begged to be ravished, the baby blue set accentuating the best features on her body. 


  He stood up and wordlessly walked to her, grabbing her hand and walking her deeper into the room. He was glad he didn’t ask her to put on heels, loving the way he towered over her. 


  “Like it?” He asked and she silently nodded. His fingers moved over the silk, coming up to the end over her breasts, the pads tracing the top of the corset. He leaned down, nose running along her neck up to her ear. “You look fucking gorgeous.” 


  Hermione sighed, her neck arching into him as hot breath doused her skin. Her hands at their own volition fisted his shirt at his stomach, swaying his body into hers. 


  “Get on the bed.” Draco growled, her heart leapt from her ribcage at the demand. She could hear the blood pulse through her veins, feel the vibrations from his voice rattled her to her core. 


  He backed away, letting Hermione walk to her bed and sit down, eyes patiently waiting for further instruction. Draco almost moaned at the sight of her, calmly staring at him, cheeks red and breasts pushing up with every thick inhale. She was complacent and it riled him. 


  Hermione felt high as Draco inspected her. Unsure of how to position herself to appear most attractive, she waited for him to take the lead. Her hands fiercely gripped the sheets beside her, as if to keep her from falling off the bed. 


  “How do you feel?” He asked, standing a few feet away from her, only allowing her to see shadows of his face In the darkness. 


  “Good.” 


  “Just good? Come on Hermione I know you can do better than that. How do you 
  
    feel?” 
  
  Draco pushed as he brought the camera up to his face. Hermione pushed her chin up, anticipation setting her body on fire. 


  “Alive.” She breathed, a click and a violent flash illuminated the room. The sound of the picture developing and being pushed out filled the silence, her heartbeat ringing in her ears the only other sound. 


  Draco took the photo and set it on the dresser, moving to a different spot in her room, a different angle. 


  “What else do you feel?” His voice was impossibly low, he barely sounded like himself. 


  Hermione looked down at her bare thighs and played with one of the bows on her hips, keeping the knickers together. 


  “Sexy.” 


  “That’s because you are.”


  Another click and flash. Hermione looked up. 


  “Lean back for me, on your palms.” His vocal chords sounded raspy and hoarse. She complied, her hips jutting out as she leaned backward, she crossed her ankles together, leaning her legs to the left. 
  
    Click, flash.
  


  It was an erotic feeling, playing dress up and allowing Draco to take naughty photos of her. Having a physical reminder of the way she looked and their activities was certain to follow would make her blush in the days to come. 


  Draco took a few steps forward, stopping at her knees. She tilted her head up, resting her head against one shoulder. His hands reached down to push her wild curls over her shoulder, the pads of his fingers cooling her heated skin. They trailed over her shoulder, running up her neck until it rested firmly on the side of her face, thumb rubbing over her lower lip. The tip of his thumb dipped into her mouth and she sucked it into, tongue swirling over the tip. 


  “Fucking hell, Granger.” Draco swiftly removed his hand and took a step back. 
  
    Click, flash.
  
   Hermione was panting when he took the picture, her mouth open from his thumb and heart beating out of control, she felt wild. 


  “Lay on the bed.” Draco said, feeling himself get excited. He walked to the end of the mattress as she slid her body back into the pillows, a small, enticing smirk tugged. 
  
    Merlin. 
  
  He kneeled at the edge and brought the camera up to his eyes, heart beating as he saw her tiny hands rub her thighs, oh gods, what is she doing?


  
    Click, flash. 
  


  Hermione felt the adrenaline rush through her with every flash of the camera, her hands wandered to her thighs and up to her corset. 


  
    Click, flash. 
  


  “Bloody hell.” Draco murmured. “Keep touching yourself for me. You look like a sin.” 


  Hermione’s palms found the curves of her breasts, lightly pushing them up and she briefly shut her eyes, sinking into the feeling. 


  
    Click, flash. 
  


  “Last one for this round, I want you on your knees okay?” Draco said. Hermione sat up and sank to rest on her heels. Draco stood from the bed and walked to the side, her head following his movements, hands instinctively fell on top of her thighs. Draco smiled as she looked at him, eyes dark with knowing want. “Perfect.” 


  
    Click, flash. 
  


  “Next one. I need to refill the film.” 


  Hermione scrambled off the bed and walked to the door, but before she could reach it, Draco harshly yanked her back into his chest, one arm holding her stomach, the other teasing the outline of her knickers, fingertips poking under the material. “Don’t keep me waiting.” 


  The sound hit Hermione straight in her center, and when he released his grip, she nearly stumbled over her feet to the door. She was panting from the show she just put on and the way he spoke to her. Once she reached the bathroom Hermione almost gasped at her appearance. Her skin was a burning pink, curls out of place, brown eyes appearing a glowing onyx and mouth parted and damp. She felt electric, her body a live wire. 


  She quickly shed off the blue two piece set and pulled the green body suit on. It was practically see through, if it were a lighter color, she could see her nipple poke out under the mesh and lace fabric. The lace had a wavy pattern at the end of her legs and bum. Lace ran up the center and flowed over her breasts, mesh left her sides visible. Hermione had to admit the color did look rather beautiful on her, she wouldn’t tell Draco though. 


  Walking back to her room, Hermione could’ve done without the picture, she just wanted Draco to run his hands over her body and rip off the lingerie. Her heart hammered, stomach fluttering and she wanted to give herself a hug for being so confident and willing to do this. 


  Draco almost came in his pants when she strolled in. Her pink lips were curving into a devilish smile, one he’s never seen before and he couldn’t help but to take a picture that instant.

  Hermione was stunned by the suddenness and raised her eyebrows. 


  “I wasn’t ready.” She pouted while partly shutting the door. 


  “You looked beautiful, I had to.” He explained with a shrug. Hermione ignored the way her body flamed and walked to the bed to sit down again. 


  “How do you want me?” She said, somewhat purposely. It was worth it to hear Draco growl. 


  “In so many ways, Granger.” Draco breathed. “But let’s get the photos taken first, eh?” 


  She bit her lip and smirked when she sat down,

  “Stop going when I’m not ready.” Hermione protested, half a chuckle coming out as she spoke. 


  “I’m not sorry when you’re grinning at me like that.” He expressed. 


  Hermione decided to move onto her knees, much like the last position he had taken of her. Only this time she stayed tall, hands rubbing up her body, over her breasts. Malfoy’s mouth parted, he momentarily forgot about the camera and almost dropped it. 


  “Like what?” Hermione grinned.

  “Like that, you fucking tease.” Draco said, his eyebrows furrowing. His comment made her laugh and emboldened her more. She leaned down on all fours and pouted up at him, arching her back as she did so. 


  “You don’t like it?” She cooed. Draco couldn’t believe who was in front of him. A confident and sexy witch that was making 
  
    him 
  
  blush now, making him unsure of his words. He was already hard, and as soon as the last picture was taken, he was going to fuck her until she cried his name. 


  “Oh no Granger.” 
  
    Click, flash. “
  
  I love it.” Draco moved to the end of the bed, Hermione moved to sit back on her heels, Draco reached out a hand to play with the strap of her teddy, sliding it down her shoulder. “I love teasing you more though.” 


  Draco’s fingertips paved across Hermione’s skin, igniting an icy fire in its path. She sighed and let her eyes close, relishing in his attention. His hand floated across her chest and slid the other strap down. Draco pointed the camera at her, focusing more of the angle on her body.

  He walked to the opposite end of the room, the slow pace of his shoes against the ground not matching the speed of his heart. Hermione stayed still, looking over her shoulder in the same position as he stood behind her, arse on display like a picture at The Louvre. 


  “Stand up.” He said and she slowly got off the bed, stopping a mere half meter away from him. “Turn around.” 


  Hermione turned and waited a second before she felt his fingers brush her hair to one side, sending a shiver from the tip of her neck to the base of her spine. Her stomach quivered as he trailed his hand down her back, resting it on the curve of her bum, giving it a small squeeze before slapping it once. She slightly jumped, biting her lip to keep down a noise. Draco focused the camera where his hand slapped her fleshy skin.

  Hermione heard Draco set the camera on her dresser and two clicks. Her body was cemented in place, voltage coursing through her veins as she heard him softly approach her. Draco stood in front of her now, winding one hand at the base of her neck, tightening into her curls, the other reaching for her arse, roughly pulling her into him, an excited gasp leaving her throat as he connected their lips. 


  The timer went off.

    Chapter Text
    
  Hermione pulled on a discarded shirt to cover herself, not understanding why it was so large on her. She looked down at it and frowned, seeing the bottom nearly hit the tops of her knees. 


  “I think that’s mine.” Draco smirked, pulling up his cotton joggers, upper half of his body still exposed, inked arms crossed over his chest as he raised a brow at her. 


  She looked down again and smelled the shirt, woodsy and sharp. Her brow furrowed and she wondered how she didn’t notice at first. 


  “Oh. Sorry. I just grabbed the first thing I saw.” She turned to find her own clothing, rummaging through her dresser to find a new shirt and pajama bottoms. Draco decided to pick up the camera and inspect it, Hermione looked up at him quizzically with her clothes in her hands. “What’re you doing?” 


  “I think there’s one more left.” Draco stated, bringing the camera up to his eye. “Smile.” 


  “No! No!” Hermione shouted, putting her hand clutching the clothes in front of her face. 


  “Come on! It’s the last one. Why not use it now?” Draco argued, still holding the camera to his face while the other wrestled her arm out of the way. 


  “Because,” Hermione tried pushing him away with her other hand since Draco overpowered her initial attack.  “I look ridiculous.” 


  “I think the freshly shagged look is a good one on you Granger.” They were spinning in circles as they continued their little fight, trying not to laugh at each other. 


  “Shut up, Malfoy. Get the camera away from me, no more pictures!” She yelled, giggling as one forearm pushed her back. 


  “Stop being stubborn, Granger, it’s one picture!” Draco laughed, successfully pinning one hand behind her back and trapping the other one under his arm, it was like a strange hug, it made Hermione’s chest beat impossibly fast. She looked up at him, struggling in his tight embrace, confused how she was so easily captured. 


  “You are impossible.” She wiggled. 


  “Get over it.” He told her with a grin. He tried a little softer, releasing her arm but keeping his hand wrapped around her waist. “One more, please?” 


  Hermione was aware the playfulness had left, Draco was entirely serious with an overarching tone of pleading coming to the surface. Her smile slightly faded and as she looked into the deep pits of gray in his eyes, getting those familiar feelings of trust flood her bones. Shaking her head and rolling her eyes, she gently pushed his chest back. 


  “How should I pose then, Mr. Photographer?” 


  Draco clicked his tongue and sat on the bed, black and gray arms holding up the camera. “Just think of something that makes you happy.” 


  Hermione paused and tilted her head to the side, the tiniest of amused huffs came out of her mouth. 
  
    I’m happy right now, 
  
   she thought to herself and almost let the words slip past her lips. But instead, her teeth bit part of her bottom lip and there was a steady yet vibrant grin on her face as Draco said ‘Smile.’ 


  
    Click, flash. 
  


  
    “
  
  There. Now I’ll take my shirt back.” Draco said, taking the picture out of the camera and waiting for Hermione to inevitably turn around to remove the shirt. Once her back was turned he pocketed the picture in his joggers. Hermione quickly pulled on her new pajamas and threw Draco’s shirt back at him. Her eyes followed the clenches of his stomach and arms as he pulled the material over his head. 


  “What’re you doing Saturday?” He suddenly asked, reaching for his wand to enhance the lighting in her room. She began to squint at the sudden brightness. 


  “Not sure at the moment. Why?” She asked while sitting on her bed. 


  “Well keep it cleared and meet me at this address at eleven in the morning.” Draco conjured a pen and paper, writing down an address and leaving it on her dresser next to the pictures she wasn’t brave enough to look at yet. 


  “Where and what is it?” She questioned.


  “Diagon Alley and you’ll see.” His eyes were bright with mystery as he spoke. “I have an early morning though so I should be going.” 


  Hermione nodded once, rolling her lips into her mouth. Draco seemed to fidget a bit as he scratched the skin on his forearms, right by the daffodils. His eyes left hers and centered on the pictures sprawled out on top of the furniture. A satisfied smirk grew on his face and he looked back at her. 


  “These turned out exceptionally well. Thanks for indulging me tonight, I’ll see you Saturday, Granger.” Draco said, loving that he could see a bush forming on her cheeks. 


  “See you.” Was all she managed out, and then Draco left her room and vanished through the floo. Hermione hopped out of bed and eagerly shuffled to view the pictures. An audible gasp left her mouth when she peered at the polaroids. Hermione had looked ravishing, a knowing smirk in literally almost all of the photos, her body curved and pronounced in the best possible ways from the lingerie and the haziness of the pictures added to the overall appeal. They were beautiful, 
  
    she 
  
  was beautiful. 


  One that caught her eye the most, and perhaps her favorite, was the odd one out. Her back faced the camera, curls hanging down the length of her spine and emerald lace showing off her bum. That’s not what made it her favorite. It was the fact that Draco’s tattooed arm clutched her body, and you could clearly see his eyes closed, half of his face blocked by her own as they engaged in that kiss. 


  Hermione snapped out of her romantic daydream and gathered the photos, placing them at the bottom of her sock drawer. If she kept having little daydreams about Malfoy that involved them being more than what they already were, she would end up hurt and alone. Take it for what it is, she had to constantly remind herself of these words. Nothing more than friends in a casual physical relationship. 


  She fell asleep that night to the image of that polaroid in her head. 



  Hermione floo’d into Diagon Alley Saturday morning, walking to the unfamiliar address Draco had given her. She wasn’t even sure it was a legitimate address, having never even seen the place anywhere in Diagon Alley. But, low and behold, she spotted Draco outside of what looked like an old cottage. An odd sight in Diagon Alley and she wondered how she could have ever missed something like this, but then again, there wasn’t much foot traffic in this corner. 


  Draco was chewing gum, jaw flexing as he smirked at her appearance. He was wearing joggers which was strange attire for him, or any wizard, during the day time. It almost seemed like he was in quidditch gear, and Hermione thought he must have been hungover, but his face looked fresh and alert, so that was ruled out. 


  She approached him with a skeptical smile and viewed the sign on the cottage. “Penny’s Permanent Strokes? Have to be honest I have no idea what this place is, let alone know that it even existed before today.” 


  Draco crossed his arms over his chest, forearms of flowers and galaxies calling Hermione’s attention as he did so. He appreciated the moments he caught her staring at his tattoos, it always made her eyes light up. 


  “That’s because you have to know to look for it.” He explained. 


  “What kind of place of business is this?” Hermione questioned and tilted her head to the side to give him a cheeky smirk. “Strip club? Illegal dueling club?”


  “My my. Someone is feeling cleverly contemptuous today.” Draco chuckled.


  “Just curious as to what adventure I’ll be going on.” Hermione responded, crossing her own arms to match his position. 


  “Not really an adventure for you, more for me though.” He explained and Hermione raised a brow. 


  “Oh?” 


  “Yes it’ll all make sense in a moment now, shall we?” He motioned to the door and held it open for her, she stepped past him, keeping her eyes focused on him until she passed the threshold. It looked like a small waiting room, wooden walls and floors with a black curtain across from them that must have acted like another door. She felt Draco step beside her, hands a hair away, able to feel each other’s warmth, or in Draco’s case, coldness, that radiated from the skin. 


  A middle aged man with curly black hair and a stringy black beard to match opened up the curtain. He was in dark jeans and a sleeveless shirt that looked like it was purposely torn. He had tattoos on his neck, running down to his hands and from the opening slits of his shirt, Hermione could tell he had tattoos covering his chest. 


  “Malfoy, good to see you lad.” He said, voice surprisingly cheery despite his otherwise ragged appearance. 


  “You as well Archie. How’ve you been since I’ve last seen you? How’s Penny?” Malfoy asked, walking forward to shake the man’s hand with a genuine smile. 


  “Doing well, Penny is lovely, thanks for asking. She told me to invite you over for lunch on a weekend you're free.” The man, Archie, stated, looking over Malfoy’s shoulder to where Hermione was slowly approaching. 


  “I’ll let you know.” Draco turned to where Hermione stopped, “Archie this is—“ 


  “Hermione Granger, I’m well aware. What an honor it is to meet you, I’m Archibald Turner. Archie for short.” He extended his hand and she smiled while shaking it.


  “Nice to meet you Archie. I have to apologize, I have no idea what he’s getting me into today so I’m a bit nervous.” 


  Archie laughed and scratched his black beard, clapping a strong hand on Draco’s shoulder. 


  “No need to be nervous unless you plan on getting one yourself. But if Malfoy brought you along I’d say he’s more nervous than anything. Come along so you can see.” Archie said then pushed back the black curtain. 


  They all walked into the back room and Hermione saw black padded chairs and foldable cushioned cots spread out. There seemed to be about six stations, with different artwork hanging in each cubby, metal machines that looked like boxes in each one. Archie led them to the first section, pulling a seat for Hermione and patting the cot with his hand, motioning for Draco to sit. Archie began pulling items from the metal box and spoke. 


  “You see Ms. Granger,” Archie said as he took out small vials, “I am a Mark Specialist, otherwise known as a tattoo artist.” 


  Hermione’s eyes widened and the tiniest of gasps left her mouth as she looked at Draco. His gray eyes were glinting with joy and he nodded slowly. 


  “I gave Draco his first tattoo which were the daffodils and leaves on his arm, then he came back asking for more and now,” Archie paused, bringing out something that resembled a gun. “Now I will be doing his newest request.” 


  “Which is?” Hermione asked but Draco answered first.


  “A snake on my thigh, wrapping around a cherry tree.” He told her, teeth flashing as he chomped on his gum. 


  “You’re serious?” Hermione questioned, not sure of the emotions she feels in the moment. 


  “Of course, we’re here aren’t we?”


  “You know I was joking when I said you should get a tattoo related to cherries?” Hermione deadpanned, so intrigued by the choice of tattoo and the fact that she’d get to witness it come to life.


  “Yes but it was a good idea. I was planning on the snake for some time now and so I modified your suggestion to make it flow well together. And, it’ll be my first color tattoo.” Draco explained rising off the bed and standing over her. Her neck completely bent to look at him. 


  “You’re getting it in color? Won’t that mess up your aesthetic?’ Hermione teased and Draco shrugged, hands winding under his joggers and swiftly pulling them down. Hermione’s mouth fell open and she looked at Archie who didn’t seem the least bit disturbed. She supposed if the tattoo was on his thigh he needed to expose the skin, she just wasn’t expecting him to strip right in front of her face. 


  “The only thing that will be in color are the blossoms on the cherry tree, nothing else. So it’ll still fit my aesthetic.” Draco explained, sitting back down on the cot. 


  “How long does this usually take?” Hermione asked and Archie walked around and placed the metal box next to Hermione. She scooted over, unintentionally closer to Draco but Archie placed a chair right by her. 


  “Sorry Ms. Granger, you may have to sit on the cot if you want to watch.” Archie said and pulled out a stool for Draco to rest his foot on. Hermione rose from the chair and hopped up on the cot, her legs dangling off the side, Draco’s upper arm pressing into hers. “And with the complexity and size of it, eh, I’d say seven or eight hours. We can break it up though.” 


  Seven or eight hours? That’s a whole day. Could Draco do this for eight hours? Was she going to stay all day with him? Hermione processed her questions as she watched Archie place an outline onto Draco’s skin with his wand. She felt Draco’s shoulder nudge into her. 


  “Is that okay? You have no plans for the day right?” He asked softly, soft eyes almost appearing hopeful. She rapidly blinked and released a large breath. 


  “Um, right, no plans. But are you going to be alright? I mean, magical marks are some of the most painful things to endure.” Hermione didn’t mean to glance at his dark mark but she did. Luckily he didn’t notice, or he didn’t care. 


  “Correct, but I combine muggle techniques with magical ones. The process of getting magically marked is entirely more painful than an eight hour session, even if it only lasts seconds. I tattoo with a muggle-like gun, and when finished, I cast a spell that binds the tattoo to the skin. I can give pain relief potions whereas a Magical Mark rejects pain potions or any type of salve.”


  Archie explained and Hermione had felt like someone punched her in the gut. She had no idea that magical marks rejected pain relief potions, she supposed that’s why they were always considered dark marks no matter the brand. Her heart ached when she looked back to Draco’s dark mark. Of course she knew it was painful, but hearing that he had to endure it without any relief felt sickening. 


  Draco caught her stare and noticed her quietness. Her face seemed a little fallen and he hoped she wasn’t feeling bad for him, it wasn’t necessary. He nudged her again and gave her a half smile. 


  “Muggle tattoos aren’t that bad. I’ll be okay.”  Draco said, his voice soft and reassuring. Hermione felt somewhat soothed as the smell of mint hit her face. 


  “I had no idea...about the dark mark.” She whispered as Draco’s gray eyes assessed her. 


  “I was sick for a week after. It’s...unnatural so not only does the mark reject the relief potion your whole body rejects it, feels like poison. I think that’s why I like my tattoos now. They serve as a reminder that I can handle pain, of what I survived, what we all survived.” Draco’s voice was equally quiet and Hermione felt her chest swell. She offered him a small smile, one that felt like it was just for him. 


  “Want to get one? Free of charge?” Archie asked, interrupting their small moment. Hermione looked down at him and swung her legs, giving a light chuckle. 


  “I think I’m okay. Thank you though.” 


  “We have all day Granger. Don’t make your mind up now.” Draco smirked and leaned back on his palms. 


  “I have no desire for one.” She said and Archie laughed. 


  “A lot of people feel that way. Well if you ever decide to get one, please come back.” Archie levitated a mirror over and stood up to grab it. “Look okay Malfoy?” 


  Draco stood up and looked at the drawing on him, turning and flexing his thigh to make sure the placement looked good. “Looks amazing, Arch.” 


  “You ready then?”


  Draco sat back down and placed his leg on the stool, Archie moved his chair and paced the gun over the outline, looking up to get the go ahead. Malfoy leaned back on his palms again, Hermione leaned forward to watch Archie. 


  “Go for it.” 


  The gun was turned on, a loud buzz that almost reminded Hermione of being at her parent’s dental practice rang through the quiet room. Malfoy didn’t even flinch when Archie punctured his skin, he looked relaxed actually. Hermione stared, trying to understand how tattoos worked and told herself to pick up a book to look into muggle and magical marks. 


  After thirty minutes of silence, Archie looked up. “How you doing Malfoy? Need anything? Want a smoke?”


  “No, I'm alright. I’m actually trying to quit.” 


  Hermione’s head whipped behind her, forehead creased as she repeated the new information. 


  “You’re trying to quit? Since when?” 


  “Since someone made it abundantly clear how much they despised the habit. Why do you think I’m chewing gum? Apparently it’s supposed to help curb the addiction.” Draco explained nonchalantly, obnoxiously chewing the gum as if to make the need for a cigarette go away. “Thought you would have realized sooner honestly.” 


  “I-I did. But I just thought you decided to stop doing it around me.” Hermione said, begging her mind not to overanalyze his admission. 


  “Nope, quit altogether.” He told her, looking at Archie drawing on him. Hermione focused her stare on him for much too long. She was in awe, completely taken aback by him. He blatantly stated he quit because of her, but maybe he was already planning to quit before she came around. 


  “Well...good for you. How’s it going then?” She questioned and he shrugged. 


  “S’alright. I’m following a gradual plan rather than stopping out right, apparently it’s easier to do so. After today, I’ll be allowing myself one cigarette every other day.”


  “That’s actually really smart. Muggles say any sobriety works best with a timed plan instead of quitting cold turkey.” Hermione found herself impressed with his plan 


  “Cold turkey?” Draco repeated. “What does that mean?” 


  “Just that you stop doing it right away. What you already said.” Hermione giggled at his confusion. 


  “Merlin’s beard, muggles have the strangest sayings.” Malfoy shook his head, making her giggle even more. 


  “Merlin’s beard is a weird saying.” She shot back.


  “No, it’s a swear.” 


  “No, it’s an exclamatory phrase.” Hermione argued. 


  “Granger, I got spanked at the ripe age of eight because I said Merlin’s beard. It’s a swear.” He stated matter of factly. 


  “Probably because you’re a pureblood. But it’s no more a swear than saying ‘what the hell.’” Hermione said. 


   “I’m respectfully telling you you’re wrong. It’s regarded as a swear no matter how inoffensive or exclamatory it is.” Malfoy said, sitting up completely. 


  “I’ll have to agree with Malfoy. It’s a harmless swear but a swear nonetheless.” Archie chimed in, wiping a cloth on Draco’s leg. 


  Hermione grumbled and let out a huff. “I strenuously disagree.” 


  Draco and Archie both laughed at the disgruntled tone and Hermione felt herself loosen a bit despite having two people tell her she’s wrong. 


  “Oh, Granger you’re too funny.” He sighed, resting a large palm on his stomach.  Hermione felt herself slightly blush at the compliment. 


  They continued talking, discussing random current events and arguing about certain historical facts. Hours had passed already and Hermione felt her stomach rumble with hunger. Draco looked over at her with an amused expression. 


  “Sounds like a cauldron brewing.” He teased. 


  “Well it’s nearly three. I would have eaten a bigger breakfast had I known we’d be here all day.” She explained, now standing up as she watched Archie nearly finish the tree. Pink and white blossoms adorning Draco’s thigh like they were meant to be there. 


  “We can stop for a break. I’m hungry myself. Packed a big lunch since I knew you were coming, there’s enough for the three of us.” Archie stated and turned off the machine. 


  “Nice of you Arch.” Malfoy said and sat up, rolling his neck, making it crack in a few places. 


  “I’ll eat at home though, visit Penny for a bit. Think you’ll be ready to continue in forty five?” Archie asked, clearing away some of the utensils he was using on the tattoo.


  “Yeah no problem. How much longer you think?” Draco asked, rising to his feet and stretching his arms over his head. Hermione watched the muscles flex and spasm as he did so. 


  “Three hours.” Archie said, walking away from them. Draco looked at Hermione and raised his eyebrows. 


  “Is that alright?” He asked her. 


  “Of course.” She replied. 


  “Not sick of me yet, eh?” He responded with a cheeky expression, making her roll her eyes. 


  “At times yes, but overall no.” She said honestly and Draco grinned. 


  “I’m off, food is in the back.” Archie said and apparated away. Draco walked into a connected room with an open wall and came back with plates with cloches over them. He set them down on the cot and pulled up chairs, using the cot as a table. Hermione sat down next to him and he revealed the food, making her stomach growl even louder at the sight of sandwiches and chips in front of her. 


  “How does it feel?” She asked, reaching for the food. 


  “It’s fine. Sore and a bit raw. Glad to have a break though, I’m bloody starving as well.” He said, biting into his sandwich. “Having fun?” 


  “Surprisingly so. It’s a very interesting process. Time seems to be going by fast too.” 


  “It does, doesn't it? It worked out perfectly.” Draco mindlessly said, attention on his food but Hermione gave him a quizzical look. 


  “What did?” She inquired. 


  “Asking you to come along. I knew the piece was going to take a little longer and I usually fidget or ask for a lot of breaks. But your company has made a perfect distraction and today go impossibly fast. I’d even say it’s been by far the most enjoyable session.” 


  Hermione swallowed a thick portion of her food, almost choking on it when he finished his sentence. Draco kept saying small things so nonchalantly like they were obvious and routinely expressed statements. But every time he spoke, her heart would lurch out of her chest and she’d force herself to hold back her excitement, or rather, her hopefulness. 


  “Thank you for inviting me. I’m not sure I would have ever experienced something quite like this if it weren’t for you.” She spoke sincerely and Draco snorted. 


  “Granger, you’re acting as if I showed my pet unicorn. It’s not all that extraordinary.” He told her and she felt a part of her chest break off into her stomach. Trying to hide her disappointment, she drank the water he provided to fill the silence, trying to rack up something casual to say back. 


  “Right, well, it’s been entertaining nonetheless, so thank you.” The end of the sentence broke off quietly, Draco didn’t notice. 


  “Of course. I expect you now to accompany me for every future tattoo. You really are the best distraction.” Draco casted a wordless spell to discard his plate. Hermione just finished her meal, sipped the remainder of her water and wiped her face before following suit. 


  “And exactly why is that?” She asked, focused on wiping residual crumbs off her body and hands. 


  Malfoy reached for the back of her chair and placed one hand on her thigh, pulling her body and the chair closer to where he sat, the motion causing unpleasant and harsh creaks to cry as the wood scraped together. Her shoulder hit the pit of his arm, hand splayed on her upper thigh, soothingly rubbing up and down. His mouth was right at her ear, whispers sending shivers across her skin. 


  “Because instead of focusing on the pain from that bloody needle, all I can think of is how much I’d love to fuck you on this cot.” 


  Hermione almost let out a moan, the sound of his voice rooted itself into her brain and spread to her lower region. Her legs seemed to open as his hand slid up further. Draco smiled and licked the vein running up her neck, earning a shuddering gasp from her. 


  “Malfoy we—no, we can’t, we don’t have time.” Her eyes shut when he sucked on the skin at the base of her neck, nipping until she sighed. 


  “We have at least twenty minutes. That’s a lot of time.” He mumbled against her cheek, placing kisses all over her face before capturing her lips and swallowing her protests. His other hand rested on her shoulder, massaging small circles into her clavicle. Hermione felt lost when his tongue wove its way inside her mouth. She leaned into him, hands fisting the collar of his shirt to bring him closer, wanting their lips to be molded as one, no space between them only shared breathy sighs. 


  Draco abruptly stood, his chair causing it to topple over loudly against the floor. He grabbed her hands, voicelessly requesting her to stand, she complied. His hands grasped at her hips, softly lifting her into the air and turning them both around to set her on the cot. 


  He found her lips again, hands remaining at her hips and Hermione’s finding his hair. The sounds of their mouths smacking together added fire to both of their insides, being fueled by each other. Their desperate hands clutched for bare skin, sliding under their clothes for a chance to feel heating flesh. 


  Draco pulled off his shirt, bare in just his underwear that gave away his arousal. His hands found the hem of Hermione’s shirt, yanking it off her body and dropping it to the floor. 


  “Draco—“ she panted heavily as his mouth latched onto the swell of her breasts, his hands roughly palming the other one. “Time.” 


  “We have time. Trust me.” He whispered, hand traveling up to her neck to tip her head back. His tongue searched for hers and she flicked it against his, making a moan rip through his chest and into her mouth. His hands were everywhere, greedy, and looking to touch every inch of her skin. Fingers skimmed across the top of her jeans, her stomach fluttered at the soft feeling. They worked at her zipper and button, and she lifted herself up so he could remove them. 


  Draco hovered his mouth over hers, not kissing her, but letting their lips brush with every sharp inhale and exhale. The brush of his fingertips trailed over her knickers, causing her to shake every so slightly, but Draco saw it, an arrogant grin spreading over his handsome face. His eyes were low, almost teasing as he looked at her when he slid a finger under her knickers and felt how wet she was. 


  “Gods Granger.” He rumbled, sliding his pointer finger into her center, making her eyes go wide and a gasp fan over his face. Her head fell forward onto his shoulder when he added another finger, pumping in and out of her at an annoyingly slow pace. “So wet for me.” 


  “Malfoy, fuck, come on.” She groaned. 


  “I told you we have time. What’s the rush?” He chuckled, barely picking up the pace but enough to make every breath of hers a shudder. 


  “Good God, come on.” She said disgruntled, voice rising with irritation. Draco laughed again and withdrew his fingers from her and took a step away, leaving her warm with her chest gasping for air. 


  Draco pulled down his last remaining barrier, being exceptionally careful not to touch his unfinished tattoo that still appeared red and fresh. His member was already leaking, the head a bright pink with the clear liquid around it. Draco stroked himself a few times, spreading precum over his length while he stared at her. Hermione licked her lips and looked back up to him, seeing a feral expression on his face. Draco stepped forward, grabbing her legs and wrapping them around his waist. 


  Her bum was hanging off the edge, and she had to lean back on her palms to steady herself. Draco moved her knickers to the side, revealing her glistening entrance. Lining himself up, he rubbed the tip of him against her center, both of them sighing at the feel. He then pushed forward, Hermione released a satisfied moan and Draco held himself inside her for a moment, basking in the feel of her securing him into her. 


  His hands wrapped around her back, angling her body up to his before he began a steady pace. His lips never left her skin as he fucked her, always on her neck, or shoulder, most of the time on her lips, savoring the taste of her on his tongue. He’d mumble or moan into her flesh, his breath causing goosebumps to erupt on her skin. 


  “Feel so good, so fucking wet for me.” He’d groan out loud and his words made her walls grab him tighter. 


  Hermione was no longer concerned about how much time they had to have sex, or the fact that this was not a private establishment, nor was it proper or polite to be having sex in a tattoo parlor. She sunk into the way his hips snapped forward, causing a burn to rise in her belly every time he pushed into her. 


  “Faster.” She gasped out the command and Malfoy grunted into her neck, immediately doing as she requested. Hermione’s eyes rolled into her head, her hips attempting to meet his fast and hard thrusts. 


  “Fucking, gripping me. Oh God—“ Draco moaned and proceeded to take her mouth with his own, a hand coming to her front and massaging her clit over her knickers. The rubbing of his thumb over the fabric made the sensation feel rougher, it was intense and sharp. She was edging closer and closer, her legs tightening their hold around his hips to keep him from pulling away. 


  “I know you’re close, you’re so tight on my cock.” His relentless thrusts and the pressure of his thumb on her clit made her body wound up. “Come on, let go, fuck. I wanna feel you come.” 


  “Fuck, yes Draco, I’m-I’m—“ Her words were lost in her throat, her head tilted back as her mouth fell open in a silent cry, her orgasm cascading through her body. She gave a desperate moan as it passed, his thumb still running over her sensitive clit as he sped up his thrusts, obviously close. 


  “Hermione—oh Her—“ Draco whispered into the air as he came. His length pulsing inside as he finished, thrusts growing inconsistent until he totally stopped and removed himself. Her head rested on his chest, his chin resting on her head. They stayed silent as they caught their breaths, air ripe with the smell of sex and Draco reminded himself to cast an air freshening charm so Archie wouldn’t be suspicious. 


  “There’s a bathroom in back, if you need to freshen up.” Draco said after a bit of time had passed, his hands playing with the end of her curls, straightening them and letting them go to bounce back into place, it was a soothing feeling. 


  “Yeah, alright.” She said and pulled away from his body. He handed her her clothes, pulling his shirt over his head while he watched her dress. She hopped off the table and almost fell over, Draco braced an arm to catch her stumble. They still felt weak and tight from their activities and Hermione bashfully met Draco’s knowing smirk. 


  “Just a little tired.” She mumbled as she grabbed her jeans. 


  “Only a little? I’ll have to fix that later then.” He cheekily said, holding her eye contact as he pulled on his underwear. Hermione rolled her eyes and silently left the room, leaving a sniggering Draco alone. 


  Once she returned from the loo, Archie was already sitting down, Draco’s leg outstretched ready to go for the final few hours. 


  “Ah, we were just waiting for you.” Archie smiled to which she returned.


  Draco eyed her then patted a spot next to him. Hermione walked over, carefully hoisted herself on the cot, making sure she didn’t accidentally bump Archie or move Draco. She sat hunched over watching Archie continue his work and Draco remained relaxed behind her. His arms were spread wide on the cot, his right hand all the way over by her right hip. His thumb would occasionally swipe across her clothed thigh, a small and gentle gesture that made her heart beat out of rhythm. He continued the motion until his tattoo was completed. 


  Once the tattoo was done, Hermione watched as Archie casted the bonding spell, the tip of his wand leaking black drops that shimmered like diamonds onto Draco’s tattoo. He wiped a cooling slave onto his skin and handed him a small vial of pain relief potion which he immediately took.


  “Right well, it’s done. Have to say, this may be my favorite thing I've done for you. Here, take a look.” Archie proudly stated and stood up, motioning to the large mirror which Hermione and Draco both walked over to. 


  They stood in front of the mirror, Hermione stared at the snake coiled around the bark of the tree, pink blossoms surrounding the ground and extending all over the branches. It looked surreal, and somehow, the dangerousness and roughness of the snake matched the soft and gentle tones of the cherry tree. Draco was right, it did flow, the opposing pieces of nature came together as one beautiful creation.


  “I think it’s beautiful.” Hermione said, still drawn to the color of the delicate flowers gracing the pale skin of his thigh. 


  “I agree. Beautiful.” Draco spoke, and her dark eyes flashed to meet the cloudy gray of his in the mirror, finding they were already locked on hers. The intensity of his gaze called a slow blush to her cheeks, matching the color of the flowers on his leg. Hermione hoped he wasn’t referring to his tattoo at that moment. 


  And of course, he wasn’t. 

  
    Chapter Text
    
   I’ll be back Tuesday. Be ready at 6:30 pm and wear one of your dresses.  

Hermione had just returned home from the supermarket when she saw Draco’s owl on her window. She hastily set her bags down and eagerly opened the envelope, half of her emotions running with excitement the other half falling to disappointment. 
Draco had left for Paris the day after he received his tattoo, explaining to Hermione that he should be back Saturday or Sunday if reconstruction had gone smoothly, but it hadn’t. She only heard from him once during the middle of the week that simply said:  Will be here longer than anticipated, hope your week is going better than mine.  
Hermione happily wrote him back of course, but she didn’t hear from him until now, Sunday evening, days after she had responded to his letter. She was feeling slightly dejected as she read the note, it barely said anything remarkable, just telling her they were going out on a Tuesday. She was hoping he’d maybe tell her how Paris was going, explain more of the issues with reconstruction, but he was straight to the point. Again she found herself saddened by his lack of tell for anything other than a physical relationship. 
But the excited part of her couldn’t be pushed down. Hermione’s stomach rolled in a pleasant way with the thought of Draco seeing her in one of the dresses he bought her in Paris. She was distracted by her own thoughts when Blaise and Ginny entered the living room, both only in towels and their face covered in a blue substance. Ginny could see Hermione smiling down at a piece of paper in her hand, so she nudged Blaise and he leaned down. 
“Think that’s from Malfoy?” She whispered. 
“Most definitely.” He smirked and Ginny mirrored the expression. They turned their attention back on Hermione, a silly school girl smile on her dazed face.
“What ya got there?” Ginny said, making Hermione scream and jump to turn around. Her heart felt like it was beating out of her chest. She frowned at their appearance, before breaking out into a loud laugh. Blaise with a towel wrapped around his waist, Ginny in her robe, both of them wearing a blue, clay face mask that was noticeably hardening, making their faces seem emotionless. 
“Oh my god! Look at you two!” She cackled, making Ginny roll her eyes before sitting down on the sofa. 
“We are doing a simple Sunday skin care routine since we’re both out in the sun too much.” Ginny explained.
“I was forced, don’t tell anyone.” Blaise said, carefully sitting down not to expose his manhood to his girlfriend’s roommate.
Hermione laughed again and sat in the chair while crossing her arms. “No promises. Godrics I cannot wait to tell Malfoy. I wish I had a camera.” 
Ginny and Blaise both attempted to raise their eyebrows but their masks crackled and they had to go back to their stoic expressions. Blaise spoke first. 
“Seeing Draco soon? Thought he was away in Paris for business.” He said, already knowing that Draco was returning soon but wanting to see what Hermione knew. 
“He’s coming home Tuesday.” She told him, noticing the odd expression that came forth through the crackles of his face mask. Before Hermione could ask him about it, Ginny spoke.
“Is that what the letter was about?” Hermione looked down at her hand, noticing she was still clutching the paper. 
“Oh, yeah.” She tried to sound emphatic. 
“Is that all it said?” Ginny pushed. Hermione was quiet for a moment, debating whether or not to disclose the information to the couple across from her. 
“No. He said we’re going out when he gets back .” She explained. 
“Out?” Ginny questioned, confused by what that meant and Hermione only shrugged. 
“No idea. He said to wear one of the dresses so I can only assume we’re going to some club.” 
“On a Tuesday? That doesn’t seem right?” Ginny said and again all she could do was shrug. Blaise made a weird sound that was most likely supposed to be a chuckle, but because of his restriction it came out like a snort. Both girls looked at him with a curious expression. 
“He’s not taking you to a club, Granger.” He said as if it were the most obvious statement. Hermione frowned at his blue face. 
“How would you know?” 
“Because I know Draco.” Blaise said not expanding further. 
“Okay, if you know him so well, take a guess at where we’d be going instead.” Hermione said, almost sounding like a child engaging in an argument. Blaise shook his head and couldn’t stop his cheeks from raising in a smile. 
“Well if I had to take an educated guess, I’d say Draco is probably taking you out to a nice restaurant that you never heard of. If he wanted to impress you then I think he’d take you to muggle London, and after dinner, go for a nice stroll in the city.” 
Hermione looked at Blaise like he was crazy, but the back of her mind was hoping that’s exactly how the night would play out. She could only hope. Shaking her head at Blaise, she acted as if his words had zero effect on her. 
“Unlikely that would happen. That’s not how we—it’s not his style.” She said, her voice lowering. 
Blaise and Ginny both looked at each other before they simultaneously said, “Mhm.” In a disbelieving tone. Hermione rolled her eyes and got up to put away the groceries. 
“You two are incorrigible.” She sighed. 
“Don’t make us laugh! We still have three minutes left before we wash off the mask.” Ginny said, fighting off giggles. 
“Well it’s true! I swear every week Ginny you’re in my ear about some conspiracy with Draco, and I don’t know how many times I have to explain it’s not like that.” Hermione huffed and walked back into the living room to kick off her shoes.
“If it’s such a conspiracy, then why is he coming back in the middle of the week for no reason?” Blaise said, raising a brow at her. 
Hermione turned around, face blank as she processed his words. 
“What do you mean?” 
“I visited Draco over the weekend when I was covering a quidditch game. He told me there were far too many little fires going on at the Cherry Pit to put out so he wasn’t going to come home until next Sunday.” Blaise revealed and Ginny smirked at Hermione as if to say, I told you so.
“And? Maybe it all got taken care of.” She spoke offhandedly and popped her hip out to rest on one foot.
“Granger, I saw him Friday. There’s no way all the problems worked themselves out by now.” He explained and she remained silent, hope bubbling in her in a dangerous but igniting way. 
“So darling, are you implying that our dearest Slytherin reworked an extremely strenuous work schedule just to see Hermione?” Ginny sarcastically asked, feigning an abhorrent amount of confusion. Hermione thought her acting was terrible and sneered at her. 
“Why yes my love, I am implying exactly that.” Blaise and Ginny’s heads both snapped to give Hermione a knowing look. She just groaned. 
“Ugh I hate you both. Stop giving me hope.” Hermione grumbled and stood up. 
“Well hold on! Are you finally admitting you like him!?” Ginny screeched with excitement and Hermione quickly escaped to her bed. 
“No!” 
“Don’t lie to us Granger, we can see right through both of you!” Blaise shouted back. 
“Goodnight you unbearable blue freaks!” She yelled and slammed her door to make a point, hearing their muffled laughs and discussion about her love life through the walls. 

Hermione decided to go with the black dress. 
Despite her apprehension, she pulled it on and sighed happily in the mirror, it looked as beautiful as she remembered. She had just grabbed a purse when she heard Ginny open the door and muffled greetings. She took a deep breath before exiting her room and facing the tall Slytherin in her home. 
Her heels clicked against the floor, alerting her roommate and the, uh, guy she’s spending time with, that she entered the room. Ginny raised her eyebrows at the dress and let out a low whistle while Malfoy just stared, looking like a dog who needed some water. Hermione thought she was going to pass out, her heart was beating abnormally fast. 
“Well, well, well. This is a spicy little number.” Ginny complimented and Hermione was thankful she was in the room. She was sure that her face was a burning red, and having Ginny in the room helped Hermione focus on something other than Malfoy dressed exquisitely well. Dressed in light gray trousers, a white button up with a sleek black tie and a gray blazer over it, Hermione was ready to faint at the sight of him. 
“Thanks Gin.” She said quietly, stopping a few feet away from Malfoy who hadn’t said anything to her yet. Instead he continued to stare, his penetrating gaze felt like it was seeping through the fabric of her dress. 
“Where are you two kids going for the night?” Ginny asked and both girls looked at the blonde man towering over them. He cleared his throat and gave a half look to Ginny. 
“It’s a surprise.” His voice sounded hoarse and it made Hermione flush deeper. 
“Ah, well keep your secrets then. I’m sure I’ll be hearing about it from this one or Blaise eventually.” Ginny beamed and Hermione rolled her eyes. 
“You won’t be hearing anything from me.” She stated, making Ginny pout. 
“Blaise won’t hear a peep either.” Draco chimed in.
“You two are no fun.” Ginny said and both Hermione and Draco laughed. 
“We’re fun, just in…different ways.” Draco explained, his pause an obvious insinuation and Ginny almost snorted. 
“I’m well aware of how much fun you two have been having.” 
“Gin.” Hermione said in a warning. 
“What? Let’s not act like we have to ignore it. Jeez.” Ginny threw her hands up and stalked away, pretending to be angry at her timid friend and her date. 
Draco, who did find humor in jousting with the Weasley, decided not to waste a second longer and took a step closer to Hermione, a featherlike touch grazing her back. 
“Shall we?” He whispered and Hermione nodded faintly. 
“Hope you guys have all the  fun tonight.” Ginny said from the sofa, eyes glowing with mischief. 
When the two passed through the door, Hermione held her hand behind her back, using her two fingers to send Ginny a very clear and rude message. Ginny had only laughed and yelled ‘right back at you’ while they shut the door. Draco’s finger interlocked with Hermione’s, the action made her gaze up at him. His eyes smiled and then they were pulled together while he disapparated. 
They landed in London… muggle London, along the River Thames, a perfect view of central London in front of them. 
Draco led them down the pavement and to the front of a restaurant that looked like a winery and steakhouse. He spoke to the hostess, gave his name and they were led to a table by the window, giving an absolutely dream-like view of the city meeting the end of the day.
Hermione was hoping her nervousness wasn’t showing through, her stomach felt as though it was ready to fall through her bum. His hand was still tightly wound with hers and he didn’t let go until he pulled out her chair for her. Draco sat down across from her, asking what wine she’d prefer so the waiter could bring a bottle out. After the waiter left, Draco’s cloudy eyes found hers, he licked his lips. 
“You’re positively radiant.” His eyes roamed over her attire, not entirely sure where to look to get the best view. Hermione bit her lip and reached for her glass. 
“Thank you. You’re looking dapper as ever.” She sipped her drink, eyeing him over the rim. He shrugged, eyes glinting with hunger. 
“I aim to please.” He responded and luckily the waiter came back with the bottle of wine and asked if they’d like any appetizers. Draco requested an order and again they were alone. 
Hermione took in the view, the sun low in the sky, views of the bridge and historical buildings on display. She sighed and found calmness watching boats float along the river, her nerves still present, but not nearly as much as when she walked out of her room. 
“Have you ever been here?” Draco questioned and she shook her head no. 
“I’ve always wanted to come here, my parents actually mentioned taking me here for my birthday this year.” She told him with a small laugh but he frowned. 
“Oh. I’m sorry that I took that away from them.” He said remorsefully and she waved her hands. 
“Don’t worry about it. They have plenty of other places to take me.” She replied, sipping on her wine. 
“Are you close with your parents?” He questioned, thanking the waiter when he set down a plate of calamari. 
“Very. I see them fairly often, we try to make plans to do something for the day together at least once a month. I think they wanted to go kayaking soon.” She explained as she piled a small amount of the fried squid on her plate. 
“Kayaking?” Draco asked, unfamiliar with the term. 
“It’s a small pointed, singular boat. You have a paddle and just row yourself in the water. It’s fun, bit of an exercise sometimes, but very relaxing.” Hermione said, biting into the food. Draco chewed for a long moment and stared at Hermione with a questioning expression. 
“Sounds interesting. Do you mind showing me how it works sometime?” He asked and Hermione’s breath halted, along with her chewing. Draco, who awaited an answer, raised his brows. 
“You want…to try…kayaking?” She asked, making sure she was clear on his question, he simply shrugged. 
“Why not? You’ve gone out of your comfort zone for me and ended up enjoying yourself. I think it’s time I do the same, maybe I’ll end up liking it too.” He swallowed his food and chased it with some wine. Hermione remained frozen, a weird look on her face, as if she were trying to gauge if he was being serious or not. She had never heard him speak so flippantly about a muggle activity and expressed interest in anything muggle for that matter. Maybe on a few occasions like the polaroid, and the tattoos, and the chocolate factory book. Still though, it made something tingle in her chest. 
“Um, sure okay.” She responded, still caught off guard from his willingness and interest in her own hobbies. 
“Is that okay?” Draco asked, noting her hesitation.
“Yes. Sorry, it just caught me off guard.” She tried to lightly laugh. “Whenever you’re free then.” 
“I don’t know when that will be, honestly. I’ve run into some problems in Paris which is why I had to extend my stay there.” He told her and she remembered that Blaise had said that. 
“What’s wrong?” She questioned and Draco shook his head, a frown falling on his lips. 
“The contractors found an issue with the building’s base, they had to reconstruct an entire wing of the building just so it wouldn’t collapse during renovations. It set us back a week.” Draco said, clearly annoyed as he shared the news. 
“I’m sorry. Lucky you found out now rather than having to deal with a possible foundation collapse while the club is running. Imagine the lawsuit.” 
“I know. Just didn’t plan for it obviously. I’m not sure why the contractors didn’t mention it when they originally inspected the building so it’s all one large headache.” He explained and took another drink from his glass. 
“Surprised you’re back then, with all that’s going on.” Hermione said purposefully. She wanted to see if Blaise was indeed correct and Draco had fit her into his schedule just for one night. 
“I needed a break and I don’t need to be there at the moment since licenses are being processed. I’ll be going back Saturday afternoon though to deal with the mess.” 
Hermione chewed on her cheek and nodded. Blaise was wrong. His schedule just so happened to be open so of course he came home while he could, not for her. Their waiter came back and asked if they were ready to order their main dishes and Draco nodded at Hermione to go first. She requested the special of the day, Draco ordering a ribeye for himself and a side of truffle mushrooms for them to share. It was silent among them for a moment before she spoke again, choking down her small fit of disappointment. 
“So what are the renovations you’re planning? I don’t remember you explaining them in detail.” She queried. 
“The stages around the first floor will be removed in a way. The private room areas and public stages will all be connected with a hallway and the public performers will be in glass boxes instead. So when you walk in, the first thing you’ll see is glass walls, all with performances going on.” He explained and Hermione tried to imagine the scene in her head. 
“Why the glass boxes?” 
“Some of my employees suggested it would be more intriguing if they were shown on display. People can walk around, see what they fancy first before committing to a certain area of the club. It makes it easier for people to see all what the club has to offer.”  
“I didn’t realize the club was that big.” Hermione said, taking the last few bites of her appetizer. 
“We saw the main level which is the main attraction, but yes, it’s larger than people realize. We can explore more of it once the renovations are completed if you’re still up for it.” Draco said, his jaw clenching while his lips twitched upwards. 
“I’m up for it.” She bravely said and Draco playfully narrowed his eyebrows. 
“Up to see Yvonne.” He mumbled, making Hermione laugh.
“Oh here we bloody go again.” 
“It’s very clear you enjoyed her more than me that night. You looked starved on stage.” Draco said, unable to keep his grin off his face while the stunning witch across from him laughed. 
“She was wonderful! You should be happy you have such a great performer.” 
“Didn’t look much like a performance on either of your parts.” Draco retaliated. 
Hermione had no words. He was right of course, the experience with Yvonne was one she kept to herself not even sharing with Ginny. It was personal and to admit she thoroughly enjoyed Yvonne wasn’t something she was quite ready to say aloud. 
“Regardless,” Draco said, eyeing the pink on her cheeks on chest. “I’m elated you liked it. I think once you see the club after it’s finished, you’ll like it even more.” 
Hermione nodded, realizing they have made future plans with each other now twice already, and their main course hadn’t even arrived. She wasn’t sure how to take it. Kayaking was mundane, it seemed like it would be a date. But going back to the club made her feel like they were still doing this song and dance of experiencing new things for Hermione’s sake, revealing her explicit side. 
She had half a mind to come out right and ask what they were doing together. If this was purely physical and fun or if Draco wanted to pursue something more.  Fucking hell, Hermione didn’t even know if she was the only witch he was involved with and that thought made her slightly nauseous. 
Draco noticed her silence, her intense focus on the condensation running around her glass of water and her chewing thoughtfully on her lip. He almost smiled, she looked bloody cute when she was incredibly pensive. 
“What’s wrong?” He broke her train of thought. 
“Hm?” 
“You’re staring holes into your water and I think you’ll soon make it explode if you focus on it any harder. What’s on your mind?” He questioned, making her brown eyes appear unsure in contemplation. 
“Nothing. Some work things I’m having difficulty with.” She lied while sighing heavily. Draco eyed her suspiciously, never hearing her mention issues at work.
“What’s going on specifically?” He pushed and she looked away towards their view out the window. 
“Oh, erm, I’ve had to do edits on this one law about fifty times. I’m hardly getting support or direction from my supervisor.” Hermione stated, watching as he slowly nodded. She wasn’t sure she came across as the most believable, but it seemed to work for now anyways. Draco watched her face contort into a forced expression but he didn’t push the issue. Maybe she really was having a hard time at work. 
Instead his leg hooked around her ankle, and kicked it up for his hand to easily grab under the table. Hermione gasped at the fluid motion, the feeling on his hand wrapped around her calf and soothingly sliding up her leg made her mouth run dry. 
“Is there anything I do to help take your mind off it?” Draco looked like the devil with the way he smiled at her. She glanced around the dining room, hoping no one could see what he was doing. He tilted his head ever so slightly at her hesitation. “Hm?” 
“Maybe after dinner.” Hermione said breathlessly and tried to remove her leg but his hand tightened around it. Draco leaned across the table to make a statement. 
“After dinner it is.” He purred. It sounded like a promise and Hermione’s center clenched. He released her leg and she slowly put it back down on the ground. The waiter arrived a few minutes later with their food, everything looking mouthwatering. 
Hermione felt less rigid as she consumed her meal, happy to focus on something other than her intrusive thoughts. The memory of Blaise and Ginny from Sunday popped into her head and she began to giggle while she chewed her food. Draco looked over at her and raised a brow at the sudden fit. 
“What is it?” He asked while wiping his mouth. Hermione shook her head and giggled as she sipped her wine to clear her mouth. 
“I forgot to mention earlier. Blaise was over on Sunday and Ginny coerced him into doing a so-called ‘Sunday skin care routine.’ I came home and they were both in vibrant blue face masks and towels. They could barely move their faces so they sounded monotone and it was so funny. They looked hilarious.” 
Draco let out a brief chuckle and shook his head, both of them smiling while imagining their silly friends. He stabbed a piece of his steak and shook his head. 
“Damn. I would have loved to see that.” Draco commented and bit into his food. Hermione nodded. 
“It was quite the scene, I was so anxious to tell you.” Hermione said and she didn’t mean to share that last part with him. She wanted to remain as transparent as he was. Draco looked thoughtfully at her for a moment before speaking. 
“You could have owled me. Would have been nice to hear something other than work.” He said, a tone softer than usual and Hermione looked at him stunned. 
“O-oh. I just thought to wait. Seemed you were busy so I didn’t want to bother you with something unimportant.” She quickly stated off handedly, thinking his comment was just a courtesy and not an actual invitation. Draco stared, reading her uncomfortable expression and her shifty eyes. 
“Well you can, if you want. I don’t really mind.” He said, waiting for her reaction which was just an awkward and soft ‘okay.’ Draco thought maybe he shouldn’t have said that, she may have not been ready for an open invitation to communicate with him outside of what they already discussed. He inhaled and racked his brain for something to cover the silence. 
“How’s your meal?” He asked, choosing something safe. 
“Delicious. This may be one of the best places I’ve eaten out at.” She confessed, “How’s yours?” 
“We’ll have to come back.” He tried, but cowardly kept his gaze down. “And good, I’m glad I ordered the mushrooms for a side, they go well with the wine and steak perfectly.” 
Hermione nodded to agree as the second half of his sentence. Reaching to scoop some more mushrooms onto her own plate. She felt her stomach turn again, unable to decipher why he was being so open about making more plans with her. It felt confusing and she found herself closer and closer to asking him what was going on. 
“Mushrooms are terrific. Though I don’t know how much more I can eat.” She said, continuing in a less confrontational direction. 
“Same. Guess the order of calamari wasn’t needed.” Draco added. 
“It was very needed.” Hermione countered, making him smirk. 
“You would say that, you ate most of it anyways.” He said, making her mouth part.
“I did not.” 
“You most certainly did. I had one plate to your two.” Draco chuckled, and she felt her cheeks flame. 
“You could have stopped me if you wanted more.” Hermione said, leaning back in her chair.
“I didn’t want more. You could have eaten it all.” 
“Huh, well you should have told me that earlier. I probably would’ve.” She told him which made him laugh out loud. His eyes crinkled and his smile was beaming. Hermione thought it was probably the most beautiful smile she’s seen. 
Their dinner ended not long after, both receiving boxes for their leftover foods. They sat and made small conversation as they finished the bottle of wine, watching the sunset over the city. 
“Do you want to go or order another bottle?” Draco asked. 
“I’m ready to go I think.” Hermione said, shifting her dress. As much as she loved the dress, she couldn’t wait to get out of it. Her stomach was full and the wine made her a little tired, she would love to slip on something cozy and lounge in bed for the remainder of the night. Draco called for the check, leaving a hefty tip for their server which Hermione smiled at. 
He led them outside, a slight breeze in the air that made her shiver. Draco absentmindedly took off his jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders. She looked down as the blazer drowned her figure, nearly laughing at how silly she must’ve looked. 
“Thank you. I could’ve just casted a warming charm.” She told him and Draco scoffed. 
“Too many muggles around.” He said and Hermione looked around, deciding that was a good excuse. She remained quiet as he walked them along the pavement, unsure of where they were heading. 
“Are we going somewhere?” She asked curiously. 
“We can. But I was just walking to a less secluded area so we could apparate.” He explained and Hermione felt her heart sink. Curse Blaise for getting her hopes up. This is exactly why she didn’t listen to them. 
“Ah, right.” 
“Did you want to go somewhere?” He questioned. 
“No, home is fine.” 
“Mine or yours?” He asked and Hermione faltered in breathing a bit. He was straight to the point, not that it should be surprising, Draco was open about physically pursuing her from the start. 
“Um, mine. I’m feeling a little tired and I have a long day of edits tomorrow so I think I should just head home.” She explained, swallowing the lump in her throat.
“Are you okay?” Draco suddenly asked. “You’ve seemed…distracted tonight.” 
Hermione looked up at him, his face void of any give away emotions. This was the moment. It was time to bring it up. He made large winged butterflies pass in her stomach every time she saw him. They had shared details about their lives, told each other likes and dislikes. He had taken her out of her comfort zone to experience life from a new, less judgmental view. They had been intensely intimate a few times and he had made her feel insanely beautiful and extraordinary. She bloody liked him, too much for her own good. 
“Sorry. I guess I’m confused by all this.” Hermione began and Draco looked down at her, seeing  her head pointed straight ahead. 
“By all what?” 
“Tonight? Having dinner. It just feels out of the ordinary for us to do something like this.” She tried to say, her voice shaking just a bit. 
“I’m not sure I follow Granger.” Draco said and stopped walking. Hermione halted as well, and courageously looked up at him, stormy eyes waiting for her to continue. 
“We’ve been doing this whole ‘have fun, let loose’ thing right?” Hermione questioned, hands animating her words. Draco’s jaw twitched. 
“Right.” He cautiously responded. 
“Well then what was the point of dinner?” She asked, hoping he would respond by saying he missed or wanted to see her. 
“I just…thought it would be nice.” 
There it was. Simplicity in its purest form with no further explanation and no insight to possible feelings. Her emotions were not reciprocated and Malfoy clearly only saw her as someone to get a good shag out of. She didn’t need to hear anymore, so she decided that if they were going to remain screwing, extra fluff and attention wasn’t needed. She didn’t want to be lead on. 
She took a deep breath, doing her best to throw on a cool expression. “Is it really necessary?”
“What?” Draco said, dumbfounded. 
“I mean, if we’re just having fun and you know, shagging, all this, dinner and taking me out, it’s not really necessary right?” She said, her heart clinging on to it’s last strand of hope. 
Draco looked at her, a streetlight overheard making her chocolate brown eyes twinkle, her hair wrapped in intricate braids though she left it down and a dress that made him want to kiss her until they were both breathless. He blinked once and thickly swallowed. 
“Right.” He cleared his throat and watched as she gave him an awkward smile before looking away. 
“I mean, if we both know what we want from each other, we can just skip formalities. We’ve already done a lot together anyways, so we can be straightforward.” She was scared at how easy she made the words tumble from her lips but even if they weren’t to go any further than this, Hermione thought she could still enjoy the relationship for what it was now.  Her insides were shattering and she just wished he’d stop agreeing with her. 
Draco looked down and adjusted his cufflinks, needing something to focus on as he forced his next words out. 
“Sure Granger. Whatever you want.” He smirked and made himself remain aloof and charming once more, Hermione felt her stomach sink into the ground. “So, still back to yours? I did promise to help take your mind off some things.” 
Hermione turned her head to look back at his seductive expression, wondering if this is what he wanted all along; just to get straight to it with her instead of mucking about with prolonged nights of going out. 
“I’ll have to raincheck, I need to get home. I’m heading into the office pretty early so I can’t be up late.” She told him and began to remove his jacket from her shoulders. 
“You sure?” Draco stepped to her, voice noticeably lower. His hand snaked around her back, pulling her body into his. “We could be quick.” He whispered into her ear, sending a shiver down her spine. Hermione weakly pushed back and gave an amused huff. 
“Yeah right.” She stepped out of his embrace, the woodsy and fresh scent of his cologne being too much at the moment. “Home for me, I don’t want to miss my five a.m. alarm.” 
Draco took his jacket from her outstretched arms and threw it over his shoulder, his other hand scratching behind his head before putting it in his pocket. Her chest may feel hollow but her lower region was wide awake, curse this overly attractive man. She shook her head at the absurdness. 
“Well, like I said, I’ll be home until Saturday, so if you want to de-stress just owl me.” He told her, making her uneasily swallow. 
“Yeah you too.” She offered, only being somewhat genuine in the offer. 
“Do you want me to side-apparate you home?” He asked. The question seems to pull them apart even further. 
“No I’ll be fine. Thank you for dinner, it was lovely.” 
“Of course. Glad I got to see you in one of your dresses.” He said, his voice sounding soft and not at all lustful. Hermione rolled her lips into her mouth and smiled, the butterflies came back again. 
Draco stepped forward and took hold of her hand, she found comfort in the cool touch, almost wanting it to be placed on her warm cheeks. He lifted her hand to his lips, pressing the most delicate kiss on her skin. Draco didn’t immediately release her hand, he stared at her for an extended period of time, an unreadable expression glazing his face, but whatever it was, he snapped out of it. The knowing smirk returned. 
“See you Granger.” 
He stepped back from her and walked away into an alley, Hermione heard his disappartion and felt her breathing sharpen and eyes begin to sting. She marched to the spot he left and apparated directly into her bedroom. 

She lied to herself. There was no way, not even the slimmest of chances that she could continue on with Malfoy in any capacity. Everything had to end, maybe all she could take for herself is a mutual friendship. 
The conclusion was soul shattering. 
Hermione came to the realization as soon as she returned home. Her chest was heavy and she absolutely knew, if she continued with him, her one-sided feelings would progress deeper than she could prevent. It all had to end. 
The following night, Malfoy had owled her asking if she was free for the evening so they could, as he put it, ‘get some rest and relaxation.’ Hermione had taken the letter but ignored it for three hours, far past the appropriate time to meet up with anyone. She claimed she had gotten home too late and needed to sleep. 
Thursday she had purposefully asked her parents to see a movie so she could be distracted from him and actually have a reason to ignore him in case he owled, which he did. Malfoy had owled her in what would have been once she got home from work, asking if she was free tonight. After dinner and the movies with her parents, she had gotten home just around bed time. A letter waited for her and she didn’t respond until the next morning. She wrote that she was with her parents the night prior and that she would possibly be available that night. 
So Friday came and Hermione decided to stay exceptionally late in the office, wanting to get ahead with some work. When she returned home Ginny had left a note, explaining she had gone out with Blaise and met Malfoy at the Cherry Pit. The note also told her to immediately come out once she returned home, but Hermione didn’t. She crawled into bed and tried to suffocate her feelings and ignore the hole in her chest. 
Hermione thought that if she successfully avoided Malfoy for the duration of his stay, and that once he’d go back to Paris for extended business, she would be free from her feelings and he would understand their friends with benefits relationship was terminated. It was a spineless escape, but she didn’t think it would be wise to flat out write him and say whatever this was, is over. 
Plucking herself out of bed in the morning, Hermione planned for a day completely out of the house. She wasn’t sure what specific time Draco would be leaving, but she figured if he was going to attempt to reach her, the safest bet for her would be to be completely out of the house. 
She floo’d to Diagon Alley, a long list of errands to run, starting with a quick stop at buying new dress robes for work. After an hour perusing stores, Hermione decided to head into Flourish and Botts, needing to stock up on new prints before students flood the streets in the upcoming weeks. 
The chimes of the bookstore run, a few patrons only in the store so early in the morning. She browsed historical biographies, sighing when she came across Dumbledore’s as always, but she decided to pick up an interesting one regarding Jocunda Sykes, first woman to fly across the Atlantic via broom. The book was smaller, it would be a quick read, she wasn’t sure if it was necessarily a good purchase so she walked away, deeper into the store. 
She came across the information section, works of wizards and witches who have devoted their life to magical research. There was a book that caught her eye, the book was a dim green but the title was in a shimmering gold. Curious, she picked it up and looked at the title. 
“Dorado.”
She whispered out loud, examining the book to see who the author was but not finding anything. The book’s dedication was in Spanish, though it was printed in English. It seemed to be about potions and the limits and boundaries of them. 
“It’s by Libatius Borage.” A voice from behind told her, causing her to immediately drop the book and gasp as she turned to look at the onlooker. 
“Malfoy.”
A blush rose to Hermione’s features immediately, a wave of nausea washed over her as she looked up at him. A small frown graced his mouth and Hermione did nothing but stare in shock at his presence. He looked down at the book and collected it from the ground. 
“It’s an anonymous opinion piece, somewhat controversial at parts but he primarily writes about the expansion of potion usage and where it could possibly take society as well as be its downfall. Dorado means golden in Spanish.” He explained as he stood back up, handing the book over to her with a solemn face. 
Hermione slowly took it from his hands, unsure of what to say so she opened up the book to glance at the first chapter. 
“What’re you doing here?” She asked bored, acting as if she wanted to be as far away from him as possible. Draco’s frown deepened and he released a long breath from his nose. 
“I have a pick up order.” He replied monotonously and watched as she gave him a curt nod and returned to being interested by the text.
“You’re avoiding me.” He simply stated, watching the panic rise to Hermione’s eyes and quickly avert her gaze to stare at anything but him. Her flashy eyes were an answer all by themselves. 
“I’m not. I’ve been busy.” She admitted, her voice weak, somewhat caught off guard by his frankness. Draco rolled his eyes at the poor excuse. 
“That’s pathetic.” He bluntly said, making Hermione get irrationally defensive. 
“It’s the truth—“ 
“Yeah sure.” He scoffed and narrowed his eyes. “I find it hard to believe it’s purely coincidence that every time I asked if you were available, you were busy until the late hours.” 
“Well believe it because that’s exactly what happened.” She responded and turned her back on him, focusing on finding another book to buy. 
“Barmy.” He said, stepping right beside her and trying to not come across as overly angry. “Granger, I don’t care if you have plans but why are you actually ignoring me?” 
“I already told you I’m not.” She huffed, side eyeing him. 
“And I already told  you I don’t believe that shit. So what’s going on?” He pushed and Hermione kept staring at the authors and works in front of her, not actually reading any of them, just blankly staring. 
“Malfoy, I had some things come up and made last minute plans with my parents. What I do in my free time does not need to always revolve around you.” Hermione harshly said, doing her best to keep calm. She could smell his cologne and it made her chest twitch. 
“I get that but why say you’re going to be free Friday if you’re really not?” He questioned. 
“I just—I was tired after work. I had a long week.” She did in fact have a long week, only because of the emotional turmoil and the extra workload she gave herself to not let her mind drift off. 
Draco stared at her, eyebrows furrowed and his stomach was in knots. He tilted his head up and closed his eyes for the briefest of moments before finding the gull to speak. 
“Hermione,” He began softly, the tone of her name coming from his lips making her chest seize. “Tuesday was different, you were on edge and constantly looked like you wanted to leave and now you’re avoiding me. What gives?” 
Hermione squeezed her eyes shut before rapidly turning to him. Draco was hardly a foot away, she looked at his chest the whole time, not being brave enough to see his face. 
“I-I just think,” She sighed and shook her head, needing the proper words to hide any hint of her actual feelings. “We don’t need to do this anymore. You got what you wanted out of it which was…getting me to loosen up and someone to shag and I got what I wanted out of this. So there’s no need to continue on.” 
Draco remained quiet, not willing to speak until she could look at him. He needed to see her face. After what felt like an internal minute, Hermione slowly looked up, still seeing the judgmental frown on his pink lips. 
“And what did you get out of this?” His voice sounded sharp yet calm, she was unable to pinpoint the true emotion behind it. Hermione gulped as she peered into his gray eyes, probably the last time she’ll see them for a while. 
“S-someone to be physical with and some new…experiences.” 
It sounded shallow but it was the best she could say without revealing that she had caught feelings. She swallowed a growing lump and looked away. 
“So instead of openly telling me Tuesday that you wanted to sever ties, you purposely ignored me and hoped that I would…” Draco made an incredulous face. “eventually stop reaching out?” 
Hermione flinched, it sounded so incredibly rude when said out loud, but it was either this or explain her one sided feelings and get rejected verbally. This felt safer. 
She shrugged her shoulders and chewed on her cheek, looking down at his impeccably shined shoes. She heard him let out a disbelieving sigh, he took a step back making her look up. 
“That has to be one of the most cowardly things you’ve done.” He bit out, a cold and sinister smile on his face. “Happy I could be useful and give you those  experiences .”
“Dra—“ 
“I’ll see you around, Granger.” 
Draco stormed away, leaving a frozen, open mouthed Hermione with a broken heart in the middle of Flourish and Botts.
  
    Chapter Text
    
  “Okay, she’ll probably be home soon. Now, it would be best not to force the issue if she first says no. If we push she’ll retract, so let's keep it as open-ended as possible.” Ginny said, grabbing the cardigan from the sofa. Blaise nodded determinedly, standing up from the sofa to meet his girlfriend. 


  “Right. Do you think I should mention he won’t be there right away?” He questioned, to which Ginny made a face to think. 


  “Eh, I think let her ask on her own, and if she doesn’t, then I’ll gently tell her he’s not.” She responded. 


  “That’ll work.” He agreed, a slow, cunning smile coming over his features. 


  “Merlin, I love us. This will be too much fun!” Ginny excitedly said, slightly bouncing on her feet. Blaise chuckled and snaked his hands around the witch’s waist. 


  “You’re a natural at deception, and as a former Slytherin, I’m very impressed with you.” His voice lowered and Ginny raised a brow. 


  “Just had a good teacher.” She cheekily responded as his face lowered to hers. 


  “Oh yeah?” Blaise grinned, not waiting for an answer before he placed a hot and full kiss against his girlfriend’s lips. Ginny smiled as their mouths moved together, letting out a tiny whimper when his hand palmed her arse under the dress she wore. Before they continued any further, the floo roared and Hermione stepped into the living room to witness their rated R song. 


  “Fucking hell you two, this is not the first thing I wanted to see coming home from work.” She grumbled, wiping the floo powder off her in a disgruntled manner and heading to her room to immediately change into comfy clothes. 


  Blaise chuckled and Ginny stepped back to re-sort herself, wiping the corners of her mouth to get rid of the excess shared saliva from Blaise. 


  “Sorry Granger.” Blaise sincerely apologized. 


  “Me too. But! I was giving Blaise another congratulatory kiss before we left to celebrate his new promotion!” Ginny cheered, happily looking over to her man and grabbing his hand. 


  “A promotion? Oh congratulations Blaise, that's amazing! What’s your new title?” Hermione reemerged into the living room and Blaise had a humbling grin on his face. 


  “Chief Sports Editor for the Prophet.” He beamed and Ginny planted a large kiss on his round cheek. 


  “That’s amazing, congratulations again.” Hermione smiled and walked into the kitchen to pour herself a glass of wine. 


  “Thanks. Gin is taking me out tonight to celebrate, even though I make more than her.” He explained, a slight complaint in his tone. 


  “Hush. I never get to treat you to something nice and we’re celebrating you so I’m covering all fees tonight.” Ginny stated. 


  “But—“


  “Nope! Not another word. You aren’t changing my mind.” 


  Hermione giggled at the forwardness from Ginny and thought it was cute, and very wise, when Blaise sighed and mumbled a defeated, ‘okay, thank you’ before giving her a chaste kiss.  


  “Ready then?” Ginny asked him and they walked to the fireplace while Hermione plopped down on the couch, happy to finally relax.


  “Yeah—Oh! Granger, before I forget.” Blaise turned around, Ginny stood behind him. “On Friday after work, I’m having a get together at my place to celebrate. You know, friends from work, quidditch players, that sort of thing, then we’ll be going out after. You in?” 


  “Oh um.” Hermione was stunned at first by the generous offer, but in her short amount of time of knowing Blaise and seeing him with Ginny, she knew he was a generous person. She looked behind him at Ginny who expectantly raised her eyebrows at her. The gesture was appreciated but she didn’t want to run into a particular friend of his. 


  “W-where would you be going out afterwards?” Hermione questioned, not wanting to be direct, hoping that her friends would take a hint as to what she was really inquiring about. 


  “Few places. Probably small pubs to begin and finish the night at a club.” He explained and she slowly nodded, looking at her wine glass before bringing it to her lips. 


  “What, um, what clubs?” She asked, taking a gulp of her wine. Blaise and Ginny both gave each other a look. 


  “Probably the Cherry Pit.” He told her honestly. 


  “Ah. Then I think I’ll pass, I’m sorry.” She cringed at herself, finding it utterly pathetic she was still so hung up on the bloody wizard. 


  “He won’t be there Hermione.” Ginny softly chimed in, and Hermione’s tired eyes looked up. 


  “Yeah he, uh, he’s having a lot of issues in Paris. Told me he won’t be back for at least another week.” Blaise awkwardly explained. “To make it up to me he offered a free V.I.P. booth for the night, hence why we’ll all be going there Friday.” 


  Hermione processed the information and looked at the hesitant expression on their faces, mildly relieved they told her now and knew it was a precursor for her agreement but still found it sad it was necessary to explain before she ultimately agreed. She appreciated them nonetheless, especially for the way they didn’t pry during the last two weeks or comment when she had come out of her room with a runny nose and red droopy eyes. Smiling at them and taking a deep breath, she gave them her answer. 


  “Sounds fun then. I’ll be there.” 


  The couple’s mouth parted into a forming smile, a bit of disbelief on it which Hermione thought was odd, but they looked happy she agreed. Well that was nice to feel wanted by her friends. 


  “Awesome! Can I wear that black dress please? You should wear the red one.” Ginny bubbly requested. 


  “I-ugh. Sure Gin, that’s fine.” Hermione agreed, making her friend brightly smile. 


  “Thank you so much! Ugh I can’t wait! We should go Blaise, don’t wanna be late. Bye ‘Mione.” Ginny waved and tugged Blaise into the floo. 


  “Bye Granger.” He half waved and then Ginny threw the powder before Hermione could say anything else. 


  Friday came quicker than Hermione would have preferred. Not that she didn’t want to go out, but going to the Cherry Pit, even without Draco being there, felt like something she wasn’t supposed to do. She didn’t want to be reminded of him all night, especially in the place where they first kissed and were intimate with one another. 


  Not wanting to be a downer any longer, she sucked it up and put away her poor attitude. Her and Ginny had just finished putting on their heels, examining each other and fixing any kinks with their appearance, Hermione obviously needing more adjustments. 


  “I absolutely love this dress on you, I’m so glad you’re wearing it.” Ginny stated, handing Hermione a small tube of sticky lip gloss. 


  “Not like you gave me a choice Gin.” Hermione laughed and applied the gloss, popping her lips the way she was shown and handed the tube back to her. “You look bloody hot in that by the way.” 


  Ginny smiled and did an exaggerated pose that made Hermione giggle. “Thank you. Not sure if this will ever make your way back into your closet, just as a heads up.” 


  “Looks better on you anyways so no complaints.” Hermione told her, thinking Ginny’s body filled out her black, lacy dress better than Hermione had. Blaise was sure to go wild tonight. 


  “Alright let's go.” Ginny said and they floo’d over to Blaise’s. 


  Hermione was astounded by the group of people, remembering him referring to tonight as a ‘small get together.’ There were at least twenty people in his place already, and possibly more to come. There was no way everyone was coming out. 


  Blaise spotted them instantly, eyes undressing Ginny as he walked over. Hermione was thankful she recognized some people from the Ministry and even one of Ginny’s teammates, she didn’t want Ginny to have to cater to her tonight. 


  “Hello darling, you look insanely stunning.” Ginny and Blaise engaged in a small embrace, his compliment making Ginny blush but she casually brushed it off. 


  “Don’t I always.” She joked, making Blaise agree. 


  “Granger, you look lovely as well.” He politely said.


  “Thank you. So this is considered a small get together huh?” She jested and Blaise scratched his head, looking guilty. 


  “It wasn’t supposed to be this large but some of my friends surprised me, but not everyone is coming out. I think the plan is to just stay here for an hour then only go to the Cherry Pit since it’s free drinks for the group.” Blaise explained, sipping on a dark liquid. 


  Hermione nodded and Ginny eyed her suspiciously. 


  “Is that alright? You won’t try and skip out early will you? I want to see you have fun and be happy tonight.” Ginny said, slightly pouting and making her eyes appear to grow wider. Hermione rolled her eyes at the playful antics. 


  “I’m not going anywhere. I’m here to celebrate your boyfriend and have some well deserved fun of my own.” Hermione reassured her friend, receiving a genuine smile. 


  The trio walked to the clusters of people, Blaise introducing them to the ones they didn’t know. Hermione was sincerely happy that she agreed to come out. This was loads of more fun than spending another Friday night alone in her room. 


  After a bit of time and everyone had reached a solid buzz, Blaise yelled across the room and asked if everyone was ready to head over to the club, to which the small crowd cheered loudly. Hermione found herself apprehensive when they left, but quickly reminded herself she had nothing to worry about since he wasn’t attending. Her stomach uncoiled some of her nervousness. 


  Only half of the original patrons came out, making it a much more bearable party. One after the other all arrived outside of the Cherry Pit, and they were allowed and guided to their V.I.P section. It was a small elevated area, three rows of plush couches that ascended from smallest to largest, looking like a semi circle. Hermione had climbed the two stairs to the middle row, sitting next to Lee Jordan who she just learned had been chosen to announce this year’s Quidditch World Cup. 


  She was two drinks in and feeling contently buzzed when a waitress came over with a tray full of shots. Hermione smiled at the purple colored liquid and greedily took the small glass as it was passed to her. Once everyone had their shots, Blaise stood up. 


  “I won’t say much but thank you all for coming out and getting hammered with me. It’s the only way I want to be celebrated.” He shouted over the music, making everyone laugh and jeer. Before everyone tipped their drink back, a man attacked Blaise in a wild hug. 


  “Taking shots without me? How could you?” Theo Nott reached down and grabbed a shot from the tray, waving to the small group as they happily and drunkenly greeted the man. Blaise widely smiled and clapped Theo’s hand on his shoulder. 


  “Oi! Took you long enough to get here you prick, where’s the other one?” Blaise yelled and just as he finished his sentence, Malfoy appeared from the crowd, his looming height making it impossible to ignore him. Hermione felt a gasp leave her mouth as she watched Draco smile at his best friends. 


  “Present.” He said, cooley grabbing his own shot and standing next to his friends. He was dressed in loose fitting black trousers that seemed to almost appear baggy and a short sleeved, light blue button up  with a white shirt underneath. The buttons were undone until just under his chest and his tattoos were fully displayed. She thickly swallowed, feeling her stomach sink under her feet. Her skin flashed hot with uneasiness.


  Blaise turned back to his group of friends, raising his glass and everyone following suit. Ginny spoke up. “To the best chief sports editor the Prophet will ever get!” 


  “Here, here!” Everyone yelled. 


  Hermione topped her drink off, a pit of anger forming in her chest as she glared at the back of Ginny’s head. Her eyes involuntarily flickered up to where Malfoy stood, panicking when she saw gray eyes pointed right at her as he spoke to Theo and Blaise. Quickly averting her gaze which lasted a second at most, she looked back to Lee, who excused himself to go dance with one of Ginny’s teammates.  


  In fact, a majority of the party was getting up to go dance, leaving Hermione alone in the middle, Ginny below her speaking with a Puddlemere player. She picked up her drink and awkwardly looked away, pretending to be engrossed in crowd watching. From the corner of her eye she could see Blaise and Malfoy sit next to Ginny and Theo climbing to sit in the unoccupied seat beside her. 


  “Hey Granger.” Theo happily said as if they had been long time friends. 


  “Hello Nott.” She turned to face her body towards him, which annoyingly also faced Draco below her. 


  “Love that dress. Not a huge fan of the color though.” He casually leaned back against the couch, arms spreading over the back as he leisurely threw his leg over his knee. Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. 


  “Funny thing, I don’t remember putting it on to impress you.” She wittily responded, arching an eyebrow at him. Theo threw his head back and laughed out loud, causing Draco to flinch and briefly look over at the two. 


  “Who are you trying to impress then?” He questioned, a cheeky grin on his face. Hermione tilted her nose up and gave out an incredulous yet amused huff. 


  “Absolutely no one.” She stated. Theo gave her a funny look, making a show out of his eyes running over her body, she looked away, feeling a bit uncomfortable as Draco’s friend eye fucked her. 


  “Hm.” Theo sipped his drink pensively. “Well you’ve certainly caught a lot of lads’ attention.” 


  Hermione looked back to Theo, a deceiving smirk on his face as he leaned in closer. 


  “Including mine.” He purred. 


  Hermione’s mouth opened and her eyes unwillingly widened, completely shocked he was openly flirting with her when Draco barely sat a meter and a half away from them. The audacity of some people. Wasn’t there some unspoken guy thing that forbade friends from going after former flames? 


  But a sinking feeling hit her hard. That really didn’t matter, it’s not like her and Malfoy ever dated, so she was fair game and he wouldn’t have cared anyways. 


  “So,” Theo began, scooting closer to Hermione, she eyed his movements as if he’d just stripped naked in front of her. “How’s the night been so far? If I would have known you were coming, I definitely would have tried to come to Blaise’s first.”


  Hermione gaped at him and chanced a look at the people sitting below her, all too engaged in their own conversation to hear what Theo was saying. 


  “It’s been fun so far.” She said. “Why weren’t you at Blaise’s?” 


  “Work things. Glad I could make it here though. What’re you up to these days Granger?” 


  “Not much. Ministry work and all.” She blandly said, heat rising to her face when Theo bit his lip. 


  “Still trying to save the world?” 


  “Always.” She remarked, making Theo laugh again. Hermione finished her drink and set it on the table beside her. This felt so weird, but she supposed conversation with Theo helped her keep away from interacting with Malfoy, so she’ll take what she can get. 


  “Spirited as I remember.” Theo quipped and she casually shrugged, giving him a forced half smile. “Want to dance?” 


  His question made her falter, and my, was he very forward for a Slytherin. Theo looked like he was up to no good, intentions not pure as he quirked a brow waiting for her response. 


  “I-I. No, I think I’ll pass.” She stuttered, eyes too afraid to see if Blaise, Ginny and Malfoy were paying attention. 


  “Come on Granger. Just one little dance? It’ll be fuuuun.” He sang the last words and smiled at her. She twiddled with her fingers, she couldn’t possibly be considering actually saying yes, was she? Looking up, she did think Theo was kind of cute, in a real scruffy way, not at all like a clean yet dark and intimidating look like Draco’s. 


  “Um, Su—“ 


  “Theo!” Draco suddenly yelled, causing Hermione and Theo to both look over at him. “Get us another round of shots, will ya?” 


  Hermione fronted, Draco’s face looked irritated as he stared at Theo who merely just smiled. 


  “I will in a moment Draco, I’m having a conversation with Granger.” He simply stated, turning to continue speaking with her. 


  “Looks like Granger needs a refill anyways. So be a decent man and get us all a round, eh?” He nodded at the empty drink and Theo looked at the table. His gaze met hers, something odd coming over his features. 


  “In that case, what will you be having?” Theo asked her and Hermione opened her mouth to speak but was cut off. 


  “Green Goblin and a shot of Gambling Grape.” Draco told Theo, to which Hermione rose her eyebrows up high. They haven’t spoken since two weeks prior in Flourish and Botts, nor has he even acknowledged her presence but yet here he is forcing his best mate into submission to cater to her.


  Theo looked back to Hermione. 


  “Is that the order?” He questioned. 


  “Yeah, yeah. That’ll be fine, thank you.” She smiled politely and then Theo got up to fetch her drink and some group shots, giving a harsh clap on Draco’s back while he stepped down onto the main floor. Ginny and Blaise gave each other a knowing look, concealing their smirks into their own drinks. 


  Hermione huffed and crossed her arms, watching the crowd on the dance floor and having half a mind to storm into the group just to put some distance between her and Malfoy. She could feel his stony stare burning holes into her head and she rolled her eyes before turning to him. 


  “What?” She barked, not understanding where the anger suddenly came from. She supposed it was maybe the resentment of everything they had done together turned into nothing and now he was treating his friend poorly. 


  Draco vaguely shrugged, eyes not leaving hers as he pulled out a cigarette from his metal holster and brought it to his lips. His gray stare almost seemed to challenge her as he lit the white stick and took a large inhale. Hermione narrowed her gaze on him, openly scowling at him and his actions. 


  “There was no reason for you to be rude to Theo.” She called him out and again, all he did was shrug with his stupid stoic face. 


  “It looked like he was making you uncomfortable. You could thank me instead.” Draco chased his cigarette with his fire whiskey. Hermione’s mouth parted and no words came out for a moment. 


  “He wasn’t making me uncomfortable.” She defiantly stated and Draco scoffed. The two seemed to forget the other pair was sitting right beside them, witnessing them bicker. 


  “Sure, Granger.” 


  “He wasn’t!” 


  “I saw your face. You looked panicked. I don’t know why you’re even defending the prat.” Draco leaned his elbows against his knees, scratching the back of his head while Hermione glared at his back. 


  “Because you were unnecessarily obnoxious to one of your supposed best mates.” She snapped and Draco swiftly turned his body to face her completely while he still sat on the lowest couch. 


  “He. Made. You. Uncomfortable. Fucking hell Granger you cannot be this bloody st—“ 


  “Alright kids!” Blaise suddenly jumped from his seat, breaking the glares Draco and Hermione were sending to one another. “I’ll go see what’s taking Theo so long so we can all have enough alcohol to make this a little more bearable eh?” 


  Blaise left the group and sent Ginny a nervous expression. She counted to thirty seconds in her head before turning in her seat to speak with Hermione, who was angrily pouting. 


  “I’m going to head to the dance floor, want to join?” Ginny questioned and Hermione sent daggers to Draco once before answering. 


  “No you go on. I’m going to wait until Theo returns.” She snakily replied and Ginny glanced over at Malfoy whose jaw tightly clenched. 


  “O-okay. Well if you change your mind you know where to find me.” Ginny promptly got up and wove herself into the crowd, Blaise appearing a minute later with worry all over his face. 


  “Think this will still work?” He asked doubtfully. 


  “Not sure. They’re acting like they hate each other but let's just see what happens tonight.” She yelled and pulled Blaise into her. 


  Draco and Hermione sat silent, loud music filling their awkward gaps as they impatiently waited for their friends to return. As seconds passed she became increasingly annoyed by him. He was openly smoking again after saying he quit, which bothered her a lot more than she cared to admit, plus, his behavior was nasty. There was no need for his terrible attitude towards her, all he lost was a fuck buddy, he didn’t get his heart broken. 


  “Why are you here anyways?” Draco suddenly shouted over the music, irritation thick in his tone. 


  “Because Blaise asked me to.” She obviously stated, turning her head away from him.


  “I mean, why did you come out? I was informed that you wouldn’t be joining the party tonight.” He explained, his forehead creased.  


  “What do you mean? Blaise asked me earlier in the week and my answer was always yes.” She responded, rolling her eyes at him.


  “Well he told me you weren’t coming, period, hence why I came out.” 


  Hermione ignored the twinge of pain in her chest as he said those words. She of course did the same thing, but her rationale was legitimate, his was solely because he didn’t want to see her. What an arse.


  “Ginny and Blaise told me you weren’t able to come because of some hold ups in Paris.” 


  “No, I accepted as soon as he asked me.” Draco explained and at the same moment, their eyes widened in realization at what their friends did. Purposely giving them wrong information for some kind of sick game. 


  “Those sodding pricks. They lied to me.” Hermione gaped.


  “They lied to 
  
    us
  
  .” Draco corrected. Hermione looked at him, and for the first time, he didn’t look so annoyed. He looked strangely thoughtful, but she didn’t dwell on it. Instead, she rose to her feet and looked across the crowd. 


  “I’m finding Ginny and Blaise to give them some choice words and then leaving.” She stepped down, now on the same level as where Malfoy stood. 


  “So predictable.” He huffed, putting out his butt and she froze. Turning around to glare at him, she was met with a menacing grin. 


  “Excuse me?” She nearly hollered, staring down at his smug face. 


  “I said ‘so predictable.’” He shouted back at her, raising up in his seat, craning his neck up to get his words across. 


  Hermione frowned. This was certainly not the man she had gotten a desperate crush on. No, this man almost mimicked a more mature version of nasty Draco from their schooldays. Her stomach rolled and she insecurely crossed her arms over her body. 


  “Why are you acting like this? You’re being incredibly rude to me as if I’ve done something.” 


  Draco scoffed at her, a condescending smile on his face. He bobbed his to the side as he looked up. 


  “You mean after you ignored me and then admitted to using me for traveling and free nights of luxurious fun? I think I’m entitled to be less than friendly.” He sneered and her chest ached. She did regret having to say that, coming off as shallow was not how she wanted anyone to perceive her. 


  “I was being…honest. Isn’t that what you wanted?” She frowned.


  “Yeah, that’s exactly what I wanted from you.” Draco scoffed but he mumbled it, not being loud enough for her to hear over the music.


  “What?” She shouted and Draco shook his head, waving his hand and looking away. This made her mad. “What!?” 


  “Merlin’s fucking balls.” Draco stood up and gripped her arm with his hand, chilling her to the touch. Hermione’s protests died in her throat, his cool hand warmed her insides despite the shivers they caused on her skin. He led them around the dance floor and down the hallway to his office. Her stomach was sinking and she really didn’t want to be alone with Malfoy. 


  He shut the door and turned on the lights. Hermione briefly looked around and saw it was messier than last time she was in there and she accidentally blushed when she looked at the couch. Draco saw and just for a flicker of a moment, his eyes softened. She cleared her throat and took a step back.


  “What is it then?” She asked, eyes avoiding him and instead focusing on the daffodils. Draco squinted his eyes at her, annoyed she couldn’t even give him the respect to look him in the eye. He moved forward, quick enough so she couldn’t get away. 


  “I understand it may be hard for you to believe that you’ve wronged someone, but I have to say it’s not usually proper to then act like a stuck up brat to said person.” His stated, eyes wildly intense and nostrils flaring. 


  Hermione opened and closed her mouth, unsure of how to proceed. He was right of course, it was more odd to see him so angry with her. 


  “So you dragged me in here only to tell me I’m acting like a brat?” 


  “Someone needed to.” He sneered.


  “You childish arsehole. What is wrong with you?” She stated, words growing in volume with her escalating vexation. 


  “Me? You come here after everything, dressed in…that, throw it in my fucking face that my best friend is flirting with you and have the nerve to question what’s wrong with me? Why 
  
    I’m
  
   acting impolite?” Draco shook his head, turning his back on her and ran his hand through his hair. He looked frustrated, eyes bright with irritation. 


  Hermione blinked and watched as he paced, a deep frown on his lips. 


  “I don’t….I don’t understand why any of that matters.” She muttered. Draco gave a single, sarcastic laugh and ran his hands over his face before turning to face her again. 


  “
  
    Fucking hell, 
  
  Hermione. You 
  
    hurt 
  
  me. Do I need to fucking spell it out for you?” His voice was so angry, so hurt and she just stood immobile, eyes widening. “You said you just wanted me for a fuck. That hurt. And then I tried to give you what you want, thinking that it would keep you around for a bit longer, but then you just…” 


  His sentence hung in the air, gray, pleading eyes meeting hers and for a moment, it felt like they were both waiting for each other to say something. She wanted him to continue talking, she almost begged him to say more but she was too afraid to ask questions, fearing she may be misinterpreting.


  “You said you were just using me. I thought—“ Draco sighed. “I thought you may have genuinely been interested in me and it wasn’t just one sided or in my head. I—yes it was physical at first but after that first weekend, you didn’t leave my mind, and you still haven’t. None of the stuff we did was ever about getting you to open your views to the world, It was all about spending time with you.”


  His mouth curved into a sad smile and he rolled his eyes.


  “Hermione I like you. Probably too much for it to be considered healthy. I gravitate to your warmth, your curiosity, I find your natural confidence enticing and I spent so much time trying to learn everything about you.  But then you made it abundantly clear what this actually was and just…threw me aside as if I were a burden.” Draco’s eyes hardened again, his mouth dry from speaking so much. 


  “So excuse my bitterness, though I don’t think it’s misplaced.” He swallowed and walked forward, Hermione barely had a second to fully comprehend his words. His shoulder brushed hers and her mind came alive. 


  “Draco wait.” Her hand grasped his forearm, stopping his stride and pulling him around to face her. His eyes were still drawn down, skepticism in his features. Hermione didn’t know what to say, so she instinctively leaned herself into his body and wrapped her arms around his middle. Her head nuzzled into his chest and she took a deep breath of his clean and woodsy scent, the smell making her throat close up. 


  “I didn’t mean to hurt you, I’m so sorry.” Her eyes stung and body throbbed, mistakes realized. After all this time he felt the same and she completely ruined it, and possibly their chances together. Draco stood completely stiff. 


  “I don’t want your pity Granger. I just wanted you to understand my anger.”


  Hermione shook her head and pulled back from her embrace.


  “It’s not pity, it's genuine. Draco I—I said all those things because I grew feelings for you and when you took me out to dinner I didn’t think you meant in a romantic way, so I tried to push it all away.” Hermione’s eyes began to glisten and she tightly shut her lids to stop any moisture from leaking. She let out a shaky breath before forcing herself to look at him. 


  “And then when I got home that night...I knew—I couldn’t physically be with you and not have you completely without it totally tearing me apart. I—I was cold and hoped you’d just move on. I didn’t want to face you, it-it hurt me too.” She took a sharp breath, her body shaking as she told him the truth. 


  “Had I known, or had any inkling I wouldn’t have handled it like that. I—“ 


  “So you had no measure of my feelings?” Draco questioned, his voice hinting with anger still. His lips were in a tight line.


  Hermione stopped talking and licked her lips before rolling them into her mouth. She shook her head and avoided his stare. “No.” 


  “Are you bloody daft?” He said and she snapped her head up to him, she was frowning. 


  “Excuse me?” 


  “Honestly. I show you my proudest accomplishments, buy you clothes, ask to spend entire days with you and wanted you to be the first person I see after a most aggravating work week. Hermione I didn’t even go home before our date, I came to see you first.” Draco told her and she assessed his words. 


  “I—I didn’t know what to take it as. We kinda did everything backwards.” She shyly said. 


  “And when I asked you to be honest two weeks ago. Why didn’t you just tell me then?” He interrogated. 


  “I didn’t think you felt the same.” She sheepishly admitted.


  “Bloody hell.” He groaned and rubbed his face. “Hermione I was going to tell you that night but you were acting so strange so I held off. You led the conversation and took it in the opposite direction I was hoping for.” 


  She felt even worse now. Her stomach churned and she wished she could have reversed time two weeks and done it all over again. 


  “I guess I’m not good at reading signs and I...overthink everything.” She said quietly, trying to turn the conversation. Draco looked at her with a sneering look. 


  “You think?” He growled and she became defensive. 


  “Why are you still angry with me?” She demanded. 


  “Because Hermione! I spent the last two weeks in agony. You made me feel terrible and worthless. It shattered me when you said you were using me. Even if it was a lie, it was still a terrible thing to hear.” He shouted at her, body moving into her space and she grew annoyed. 


  “I already told you I’m sorry! I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, that was never my intention, I was trying to protect my own.” She expressed. 


  “You could have been honest!” He retaliated, stepping to her. 


  “I was scared! I don’t know what more you want from me?” She threw up her arms, her hands slapping at her bare thighs. 


  “I want to know if you felt the same pain in the last two weeks I did and if you regret it. I want to know if you realize how badly you hurt me.” He emphasized and Hermione felt her heart beat out of rhythm. 


  “I told you! Draco, I was overwhelmed. I-I didn’t expect you and I didn’t expect to fall so quickly for you. You’re this large, daunting, unhinged, spontaneous and wildly free man, and you showed me so much and made me feel…
  
    so 
  
  many new and liberating things. Every time I was with you it felt like I was digging myself into a hole and I wasn’t sure if I was going to get out without hurting myself.” 


  Hermione took a breath, feeling her throat tighten again. She rapidly blinked, Draco became blurry in her vision. He was still close, his manly scent making it harder for her to breath, she started to choke out her words. 


  “I cried over you and-and lost sleep over you and I understand it was my own doing but holy 
  
    fuck, 
  
  you unexpectedly became the person I wanted the most and you truly think it was 
  
    easy 
  
  to let you go? You think I wanted any of this? To feel so out of step in my own life without you? I was hurt too!” 


  She grew increasingly impatient as she practically shouted at him, a single tear fell from her face and she swiped it away. Her breathing was fast and she tried to calm herself down. Bravely looking at his face, he held a stunned and calm expression. His mouth parted to a sliver, eyes softened but increased in size. 


  “Draco I—“ she gave a sad laugh and sniffled. Looking up to his shining gray eyes, she gave him a weak smile. “I can’t tell you how many times I came home hoping to see your owl again, or how much I’ve wanted to tell you every stupid thing I witnessed Blaise and Ginny do, or how I have to avoid looking at cherries in the grocery store because it reminds me of you.” 


  She sniffled, a heavy, sharp, sigh fell from her lips. Her shoulders shrugged as she looked at him with eyes filled with tears. “Draco I-I missed you.”


  With her confession, Draco swayed closer into her body and took a stray curl, testing to see if it was as smooth as he dreamt of it being. He thoughtfully looked into her silky brown eyes and licked his lips, the corner of his mouth ever so slightly turning upwards. 


  Draco softly took her face with both hands, their stomachs brushing against each other as he leaned his neck down. Hermione’s eyes fluttered as the cool tips of his fingers threaded into her hair. She leaned into his palm, hands reaching up to hold on to his beautifully inked forearms. Hermione looked back up to him, her body humming with suspense as she watched a small grin pull at his features. 


  “I missed you so much Hermione.” Draco mumbled and she felt her heart soar. 


  Draco closed the final gap, fusing their lips together and repairing every torn heart string in Hermione’s chest, and his. Their mouths molded like a key fitting into a lock, everything they should have said weeks ago pouring into their kiss. It was frustration mixed with sadness and utter relief.


  They kissed slowly, afraid to move too fast in case the moment would be lost. Hermione sighed when his tongue found hers, teasing her with small touches and too quick licks. She slid her hands to his chest and down his stomach, making Draco kiss her more fiercely. He didn’t remember how soft her lips felt and she didn’t realize how lovely his low whimpers sounded in her mouth. 


  His hand slithered to her back, his heavy palm pushing her closer into him, making Hermione gasp when she could feel the outline of him press into her stomach. Their kisses were still leisurely passionate, but it made Hermione feel highly wired. Her blood was rushing all over her body, her center throbbed for him and she desperately tried to pull him deeper into her mouth. 


  Draco wrapped both arms around her now, holding her tightly to his body. He pulled away, only for a second to catch his breath and disapparate them out of his office. The pull of the apparation made her dizzy, but when his lisp found hers again, she felt grounded.  She slowly opened her eyes, trying to turn her head to view her surroundings. Draco’s plush lips found her neck, lovingly sucking on her vein. 


  “Your villa?” She sighed when softly bit into her skin, her fingers combing his hair. The master bedroom looked the same, the doors closed but city lights still illuminating the dark room.


  “Mhm.” He mumbled in her skin, inhaling the sweet scent he craved. He pulled away, both their eyes shining bright, lips swollen and wet from their kiss. They shared a shy smile as their hands roamed over each other, communicating the emotion through delicacy and gentleness. 


  Draco’s fingers trailed up the teeth of her dress’ zipper, causing her skin to rise in goosebumps. “You look beautiful in this.” He whispered into the darkness and smiled, it made her blush. “Can I take it off?” 


  She nodded and heard the zipper being pulled down, his eyes never leaving her own. His hands pulled down the dress, and once it was over her hips, it easily fell to the ground. She stood in only a silk pair of black knickers, a thong with very small straps that hugged her hip bones. 


  Draco felt impossibly warm. He went against his instincts to throw her on the bed and give each other the quick and needy fuck he knew they were both desperate for. Instead, he let the pads of his fingers trail over her body, savoring the softness of her skin and mesmerizing the map of her body.


  He continued to touch her as her hands reached for his shirt, tucking it out of his trousers and shedding it from his shoulders. She then pulled his undershirt over his head, leaving them both bare on top. He paused her movements to his pants, and reached for her face, needing to feel her naked skin on his briefly. 


  Hermione shuddered when his hand hesitantly moved down her stomach, her insides flipping and turning with joy. Fingers felt under silk, finding her slick folds and parting them to collect her arousal and massage her clit with it. Hermione whimpered, a mewling moan rising in her throat as he eased two fingers into her, pumping in and out at an agonizing pace. 


  Her head fell back and she felt her center tighten around his elongated digits. Her hand clutched at his neck, the other gripping his flexing bicep with each push of his fingers into her. 


  “Draco,” she breathed, and he thought it sounded like a hymn. “Please, I need more. I want you now.” 


  Slowly withdrawing his fingers, Draco sunk to his knees, lifting one leg until her foot rested on his thigh. She watched with hazy vision as he removed one of her heels, kissing her ankle up to her knee and then placing it back on the floor. He did the same with her other foot, keeping his darkened gaze on her, drawn to the heavy breaths falling from her chest. 


  His lips continued their blazing path up her thighs until his teeth scraped against the material of her knickers. With a painfully slow pace, he rid her of her last barrier, rising to his full height once she stepped out of them. 


  Draco held her hips and walked her backwards, sitting her down on the edge of the massive bed. He remained standing, working to remove his buckle. Hermione reached her arms up and let her nails scratch against his snowy skin, watching in fascination as his stomach muscles contracted under her touch. 


  As he pushed down his pants, his fists rested on either side of her body, their mouths centimeters away. She reached forward, cupping his jaw in her hands and pulling him backwards to her. Their lips met in a messy, unhurried kiss, their bodies crawling onto the center of the bed. Draco lowered his weight on top of hers and she sighed contently. 


  She parted her legs, hips welcoming him closer and she began to roll her body into his with need. His tongue wove into her with every pull of their lips, his taste driving her mad. Draco groaned when the head of his member found her slick center. He reached between them, halting their kiss and took himself In his hand. Positioning himself at her entrance, his arms moved by her head, thumbs caressing her face. Hermione wrapped her arms around his back and shoulders, urging his body forward. 


  With a slow push of his hips, he entered her, causing vibrating moans to pour out between them. She welcomed the stretch with a happy sigh and he found a steady pace immediately, still needing to take his time and bask in her being with him at this moment. He stroked her g spot with shallow and hard thrusts, just the way he knew she absolutely loved and hated. 


  “
  
    Oh
  
  , oh gods, Draco.” She whispered, bucking her hips to get him deeper. Digging her heels into the mattress, she tried to meet him but quickly grabbed her legs and tied them over his hips. When he leaned back down and returned to thrusting, his lips found her ear. 


  “Just feel me, focus on me.” He whispered, pulling almost out of her completely before filling her again. Hermione could already feel the sharp fire burn in her stomach, he could get her off quickly if he sped up, but the rate he was going at felt punishing. 


  “I want more.” She whined, earning a soft chuckle from him. 


  “I’ll get you there. I want this to last long and make up for lost time.” His voice was hot in her ear and let out a long moan after a particularly deep thrust. He buried his face into her neck, forehead nuzzled against the wild curls splayed under her. Hands moved under her back, cradling her body. 


  Hermione was overcome with pleasure, her center increasingly dampening and she was soon moaning with every push of his hips. Draco was panting into her neck and she eagerly kissed his cheeks, trying to get to his lips. Complying with her efforts, Draco rose up, finding her mouth and giving her a long, compelling kiss. 


  Picking up his pace, he switched the angle of his hips, making her let out a needy cry. Draco looked at her face and felt his heart ache with happiness. 


  “Say you’re mine Hermione.” His forehead rested on hers, the quiet plea made her eyes open. “Please, tell me you’re mine.”


  Hermione gasped, her legs locking around his waist, her hips trying to take more of him. So close, so close. His voice was so husky, so deep with lust. Her eyes rolled back at the emotional request. 


  “Yes, Draco. I’m yours. I’ve been yours.” She cried, and Draco increased his speed. 


  “Oh fuck.” He sighed as her center fluttered around him, beckoning him to his end. “I’m yours Hermione, all yours.” 


  Hermione threw her head back and came with a loud cry, her moan carrying Draco to meet his own orgasm. They held onto each other as the blinding pleasure washed between their bodies, grasping and shaking against one another. The air felt too thick but both didn’t dare to move, needing the moment to remain as pure as gold for the most amount of time. Draco’s head laid on her chest, her fingers brushing his hair away from his damp forehead and his fingers lightly rubbing her sides. 


  “I want to be with you.” Draco said after a prolonged moment. Hermione smiled, she already knew that since those words, though phrased differently, brought her to her climax. Nonetheless, she answered him with the same honesty and genuineness as before. 


  “I want to be with you too, Draco.” She whispered and he pulled his head off her chest, wanting to look at her. Removing one hand from her back, he brought it up to stroke her cheek with the back of his hand. They stared at each other in a daze, both seeming in disbelief that they were here, in one another’s embrace. He leaned down and kissed her left cheek, then right before finding her pouty lips in a sincere kiss. 


  “I’m so sorry for hurting you. I wasn’t trying to be unkind, I honestly thought you’d be unaffected.” She frowned and Draco just shook his head. 


  “Oh my little oblivious witch. All is forgiven. I’m sorry for being so angry with you. It’s not fair of me not to give you the benefit of the doubt when I could have revealed my feelings too.” Draco rolled off of her but tugged her into his side. She cuddled herself into his warm, but sticky body. 


  “Next time, please just tell me the truth and I’ll do the same.” He whispered as he played with a curl. He felt her nod against his chest and plant a soft kiss on his chest. 


  “I will.” She whispered. 


  After a few moments of blissful silence and gentle touches and kisses, Hermione began to smile.


  “You know we should probably thank Blaise and Ginny for tricking us to come out tonight.” Hermione commented. 


  “I refuse to give those meddling pricks any praise. We would have found a way to reconnect eventually.” Draco adamantly told her, making her giggle. 


  “Oh yeah, you think so?” 


  Draco leaned down, held her face and kissed her, his tongue dove into her mouth unapologetically. She whimpered at the gesture and was sad when he removed his lips off hers. 


  “I know so.” He darkly stated, making her stomach delightfully twist. She nuzzled deeper into his chest and tangled their legs together. “Can you reach for my wand? I want to clean us off.” He asked. 


  He loosened up his embrace so she could wiggle out. Crawling over to the side of the bed, she blindly felt on the ground for it. 


  “I can’t see anything, where did you drop it?” She questioned and Draco responded by snapping his fingers, causing the bedroom to light up. Hermione briefly squinted her eyes and groaned, not used to the bright light in the middle of the night. She saw the wand poke out from under the bedside table and successfully reached for it. Once in her grasp she sat back upright on the edge of the bed. She began to turn to hand Draco his wand but something on the table caught her eye. 


  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory laid face down with a very curious bookmark poking out. It looked familiar, so Hermione reached for it. Removing the bookmark, an inaudible gasp fell past her lips. There was the polaroid of her, adorned in his oversized black t-shirt, a large, cheek to cheek smile on her face that almost seemed like she was mid laugh and her curls tangled from the activities they did right before he took the picture. 


  Hermione looked back at him with a cheeky grin, eyebrows raised and waved the photo at him. 


  “What’s this then?” 


  Draco peaked his eyes to see what she was referring to. Once he saw the picture in her hands, he immediately blushed and lunged to reach for it, but Hermione was too far out of reach and hastily stepped out of the bed, away from him. 


  “Hm?” She pressed. 


  “Hermione, you know what it is. Just give it back.” 


  She laughed but decided to be generous and hand it back to him. Draco jokingly sneered and snatched it out of her grasp. He looked at it, soft eyes tracing over the photo before moving to put it on the table, safely under the book. 


  “Why do you steal that one?” Hermione asked and sat back down next to him, into his open side. 


  “You looked beautiful, it was my favorite from that day.” He told her, rubbing his nose against the side of her head. 


  “That was your favorite? I wasn’t even in the lingerie.” She said confused. Draco touched her face with featherlike precision, eyelashes motoring against her cheeks. 


  “You looked heavenly. Your smile is magnetizing in it and it’s directed at me. I-I’d look at it and just feel…happy. Plus you look bloody adorable dwarfed in my shirt.” He kissed her head and she beamed up at him, her insides warming at his words. 


  “In the time we got to spend together, when I wasn’t worrying about whether or not I was reading your signs wrong, I was so happy.” She admitted, reaching for his hand to interlock their fingers. “I’m happier now though.”


  He sighed and rested his head on hers as she brought his knuckles up to her lips. 


  “Stay the weekend with me.” Draco whispered the statement and grinned when he felt her head nod under him. “Anything you’d like to do while we’re here then?” Hermione pulled back, staring into his swirling gray eyes, feeling entirely content.

"Can we visit the club? I'd like to see the updates and...and possibly go back? Other than that, I just want to spend time with you." She asked with a smug grin though she was blushing. He smirked, brushing some of her hair out of her face.

  "We can do that." He mumbled while 
  taking her face into his hands and planting a kiss sweeter than cherries on her lips.
