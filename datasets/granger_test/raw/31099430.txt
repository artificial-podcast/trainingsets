  1999
With a deep breath she took one last drag of her pre-lit cigarette and Astoria flicked it out the window. She glared around her surroundings and was anxious to exit the car. Astoria reached into her black leather purse and pulled out a compact mirror. She applied some striking red lips, pinched her cheeks to appear more rosy and less flushed. Since the color from her face drained with every meter the car traveled. After what seemed like hours, the car came to a stop. She glared out the window to see nonother than the tall domain of Malfoy Manor.Astoria would have rather apparated, but she felt perhaps a muggle car ride could soothe her nerves? She realized quickly she had mistaken."We have arrived Miss. Greengrass." The driver said calmly. He opened her car door and extended his hand to guide her out.Her black heels touched the ground and she looked up at the tall hedges lining the pathway up to the front gate entrance. As she strode up to they  opened for her automatically. Astoria felt her palms begin to slightly moisten and become clammy in the slits of her digits. Her heartbeat elevated with every step closer to the door. She took note of the many rose bushes that lined around the manor. Astoria knew that Narcissa always made sure the Manor elves kept up with their gardening chores.Astoria stood at the foot of the front door and held the large knocker, took a deep breath and knocked three times. Soon after a tiny house elf opened the door."Miss. Greengrass? Bopsy welcomes you. Master Malfoy and the others, are waiting for you in the formal living room." The tiny elf pointed in her direction. She smiled down at the tiny creature and nodded. As she walked into the foyer she looked down the floor and then back up again the walls. Memories came flooding across her mind like a movie on a screen.Astoria's stride came to a hold when she heard yelling coming from the room. She slid up against a wall before she made her arrival known. She quickly realized it was Draco and Lucius quarreling."Draco, pull yourself together and start acting like the future master of this house. You should feel lucky the Dark Lord is offering such an opportunity. I do not understand what is troubling you!" Luscious sneered.Astoria was beginning to realize Draco was not pleased about the arranged marriage and she knew why. With everything that happened at the end of their sixth year and the Battle of Hogwarts, Astoria knew that it was going to be an adjustment period. The blond felt her heart ache at the thought of Draco loathing her, but she had to push that feeling to the back of her mind.Astoria knew that the moment she and Draco would lock eyes, she would melt, so it was time for the Occlumency walls to commence. She was quite good skilled at Occlemency and Legilimens. Astoria smiled softly and remembered how she had a marvelous instructor during her school days..."Father, I cannot marry her. Astoria Greengrass is a revolting cunt of a witch. I will not marry her.""Now you listen here, my son. This is what the Dark Lord wishes. Who are we to go against his orders? We will be back in good faith with the Dark Lord and he will allow us a spot, once again, at his high council. Draco, you will cast out any other whores you have had in the past and you are to focus on Astoria once more." Lucius spat."Astoria Greengrass is a whore and I will not-"Astoria walked in abruptly, and put her hands together and clapped. Slowly. Three times. In a mocking sense. Her head cocked to the side and she let out a slight under-toned chuckle."Yes, well this whore is to be your wife so I suggest some future respect from now on, darling." Astoria spat while making eye-contact with the Malfoy men, specifically Draco.Narcissa immediately entered the room and embraced Astoria."Welcome back to Malfoy Manor, Astoria. I trust your trip was comfortable?" Narcissa said lowly with one hand on Astoria's shoulder. Her smile was kind and slightly off balance. Astoria felt a sense of comfort with her soon to be mother-in law, but she could feel the situation becoming abundantly tense. She really needed someone who did not loathe her openly in this house, and hopefully, Narcissa could be that someone."It was quite comfortable. I thank you for inviting me to stay here while the wedding preparations commence. Since the accident at the Ministry I no longer feel at home anymore in Leeds. My mother has recently returned to France to.... mourn my father." Astoria said while lowering her head. She loved her father dearly, but he should have known the consequences with messing with the Dark Lord's property. Astoria knew, that she was never going to see her mother again.Lucius strode forward to take his place next to Narcissa."I do offer my condolences for your father. Quite a nice fellow. He offered a fresh idea to council meetings all those years ago." Lucius said while stamping his cane to the ground. Ignoring Lucius, Astoria made eye contact with Draco again."Are you going to say anything to me Draco?" Astoria said while quirking her eyebrow. She wanted him to say something. Anything. A rude comment. Anything to break his deafening silence."I have nothing to say to you, Greengrass. Do me a favor. Turn your filthy ass around, get back in the car, and ride off back to wherever you came from. I refuse to marry you." Draco said as he got close to her face. He was almost breathing on her and she noticed Lucius' hand catch his left arm back."It is the Dark Lord's request this union takes place. As I have been informed, you are in no position to ignore his wishes." Astoria spat in his face with a smirk on her face. Draco knew he was stuck. All he could do was let out a deep breath and he darted out the back door to the terrace.Narcissa interjected as she laid her hand upon Astoria's shoulder. "I do apologize for my son's rude behavior. He has not quite adjusted to the news. I have no idea why. I thought he would be pleased with the arrangement given your erm- former history.." Narcissa said lowly.Astoria's eyes began to pool slightly until she caught herself. She turned to Narcissa."That was ages ago. People change." Astoria said and she made her way to the back doorAstoria made her way onto the terrace. She pulled out a chair and pulled down her dress before she took a seat. She began fiddling with the emerald jewel snake necklace around her neck until she met eyes with her pale fiancé. Draco acknowledged her presence and leaned over to her."Leave me with my thoughts, Greengrass. I do not fancy you, no matter how many times you bat your eyes or bend over in front of me. Our story ended the day we left that pathetic school. I am not the man you once knew." Draco growled at Astoria.Astoria shifted in her seat. She pondered at what her recall response would be.  Should she give him a sarcastic remark?An insult? Should she touch that one soft spot he has in his cold dark heart?"Draco, I would advise you to not piss me off. You know the power I hold in my pocket and I would not recommend getting on my bad side. If I do not have your cooperation from this point on I will be forced to go after a certain girl. A girl who is brave but yet so smart. A girl who has a rats nest for a head of hair. Also a girl whom I despise greatly." She said breathlessly while fiddling with her nails."She has nothing to do with this. Leave her out of this Greengrass. You go near her and you will not live to see the dawn rise from the night." Draco grabbed Astoria's wrist while staring at her with anger.Astoria reached into the side pocket of her purse, took out her cigarette, placed it between her lips and lit the tip. She inhaled deeply and she could feel Draco's eyes burning right through her. She could feel Draco's eyes burning right through her body.He was angry. He was determined to put an end to this union.Astoria took the cigarette out of her mouth and placed it in between two fingers in her left hand, she leaned in to whisper."Do not give me reason to go after your little mud blood, darling. You know what I can do so I would not test my abilities and push me. That little frizzed haired freak has no power compared to me." Astoria spat with a smirk.She dropped the cigarette to the floor, smushed it with her foot and rose to her feet.  Draco would not make eye contact with Astoria, but his face said a thousand words."Meet you inside? Ferret boy." Astoria winked at Draco and pranced away.Astoria walked inside to the foyer and saw that her luggage was gone. The small house elf, explained to her that her bags have already been taken to her room. Draco crept inside the hood of the doorway to the dining room with his eyes to the floor and his hands in his pockets. Astoria looked at the ground of the foyer and recalled the last memory she had of it. She stood in the spot where she damned him in a life of servitude to the Dark Lord.Astoria flipped her hair and strode up the stairs, gliding her finger tip against the banister. She felt Draco's eyes burning through her as she walked. Draco always watched her, even when they were at Hogwarts she always felt his intense gaze.When Astoria made it to the top she was directed to her room by a house elf. In the middle of the room fit a king sized bed with a thick comforter. She noticed she had a makeup vanity, and a largely sized boudoir. When she opened up the doors she noticed the boudoir was enchanted to fit her unnecessary amount of outfits.When she went to close her door she noticed Draco peering in from the banister. She smirked at him and cocked her head."Are we not sharing a room?" She inquired. "We are to be man and wife darling. It seems only natural that we-""You will not share my bed ever again, Astoria. You may have slithered your way back into my life, but stay out of my way." Draco spat at her.Astoria scoffed and shook her head."Hmm... not very friendly. Maybe I should remind you to respect your superiors." Astoria charged while slightly reaching for her wand.Draco turned on his heel and bolted down the hallway, into the formal study area."Welcome back, Tori." Astoria whispered to herself.

    Lyon, France. Summer, 1994
"Welcome back ladies, it is a pleasure to see all your darling faces again. Please make haste girls into the main hall. There is an announcement to be told." Astoria glared over at her tall headmistress, Madam Maxime. Maxime was wearing a yellow large over coat, followed by grey slip-on shoes.
"What do you suppose the announcement is Tori?"
"I am not sure Fleur. Maybe we are getting a new etiquette and poise professor. Ever since Professor Trudy resigned last year after having to deal with fifteen-year-old smart mouth girls, Madam Maxime has been on the look out for a new instructor." Astoria paused and leaned in further to her friend's ear. "Merlin knows some of the girls around here would benefit from learning some basic social etiquette." The two young ladies chuckled, and their eyes flashed toward the front of the room where it seemed Madam Maxime was about to make her announcement.
"Welcome back again my darling girls. This is going to be a special year for not only the Beauxbaton Academy of Magic, but for every girl who is old enough to take part in this very special opportunity. We have been selected to participate in the Triwizard tournament that is taking place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Madam Maxime paused and allowed a member of the Ministry of Magic to take her place as the speaker and explain the situation further.
"For the ladies' safety, no girl under the age of seventeen will be permitted to participate in the tournament. Such measures were put in place by Cornelius Fudge, our minister for magic." The minister member paused and scanned the room slightly, locking eyes with a few of the ladies until he began to finish his speech. "This opportunity is not only for those willing to be selected for the tournament. All ladies who wish to support our champions and participate in viewing the tournaments tasks may join Madam Maxime in making Hogwarts their home for the rest of the school year. The minister feels that it is beneficial to meet students from all walks of the globe. I have nothing further. If you wish to join Madam Maxime please send an owl with your name printed on a piece of parchment and send them into me and I will assess them. We depart in one week's time. Thank you, girls, goodnight."
Astoria and Fleur scurried across the hall making haste to reach their common room. Both girls were sorted into the Ombrelune house. Girls who were Ombrelune were curious, ambitious, and cunning. Astoria liked to succeed in all she did, and she rarely ever lost a fight, no matter who was in her pathway.
To be sorted into a house at the Beauxbaton Academy one must shoot an arrow across the room, and after several seconds the arrow will burst out a color of a house. Whichever color bursts from the arrow is the chosen house for that witch.
When Astoria was eleven years old and first arrived to Beauxbaton she was determined to be sorted into Ombrelune, because she was a pureblood and most purebloods ended up in the Ombrelune house. Astoria held the bow and arrow in her hand, took a gaze at the target in front of her and released. When the arrow burst into blue, a small smirk glimmered on her face.
"Fleur, are you going to enter the tournament? You can since you're of age. Such a preposterous rule of having to be a certain age to participate in wizarding challenges. Such rubbish." Astoria inquired while glaring at her friend.
"I am pondering the idea. I must think about my little sister. I have heard these games can be dangerous, and I am not sure if eternal glory is worth the risk of leaving my little sister as an orphan." Fleur peered down as she was changing into her night attire, and grabbed a book that was on her nightstand.
"I guess you are right. At least you have a sister that cares so much for you. I have not spoken to Daphne since I saw her for Spring break. Since I did not return home for summer break, I have not seen my parents in over four months. I guess that makes me a bad daughter." Astoria bowed her head in shame and began fiddling with her thumbs. Fleur grabbed her hand, gave it a squeeze and gave her a reassuring look before diving into her book.
Astoria is English and French. Her father, Thomas Greengrass, was a noble Englishman and worked a high-powered job at the Ministry of Magic. Astoria's mother, Eloise Greengrass, was born in France and was close friends with Madam Maxime. Eloise had also attended the Beauxbaton Academy and she was thrilled when Astoria showed the same interest in studying magic where her mother did. Astoria also had a little sister, Daphne. Daphne attended school at Hogwarts and was sorted into Ravenclaw house. Daphne and Astoria rarely spoke and when they did it was minimalistic. Small talk about the family, school grades, and current friends. Astoria sometimes wished her, and Daphne had a better relationship, but she did not know if her sister felt the same, so she never reached out during the school year.
The next morning Astoria woke up to find Fleur writing her family about departing France and making her way to England."You really should write Daphne and announce your arrival. She's going to be pretty surprised to see her sister at Hogwarts if she is not expecting you." Fleur stated while still writing vigorously on the piece of parchment. She attached the letter to her owls beak and sent him off into the sky.
Astoria felt it was a good idea and she decided to write her parents and Daphne and announce the news of her journey to Hogwarts. After half an hour of trying to find the words, she came up with just a few.
Hey Daph,
I hope all is well. I know this is crazy, but I am coming to Hogwarts with the Beauxbaton's. I am accompanying Fleur while she attempts to participate in the games, and I want her to know she has my support. I just wanted to give you a heads up. I shall arrive alongside the rest of the girls by the end of the week.
See you soon.
Cordially,Astoria
Astoria sealed the letter and sent it off with her owl and hoping it will arrive by the end of the night. The next letter she began to write was to her parents.. she never wrote her parents during the term.
Mother & Father,
I will be arriving in England by the end of the week. I shall be spending this school year at Hogwarts with the rest of the girls from Beauxbaton and Daphne. I shall provide more detail when I arrive at the end of the week.
-Astoria
A couple days had passed since Astoria sent the letters and she heard no response from Daphne. She received an acceptance letter from her parents the next day, but she was nervous about hearing nothing from her sister. Would she be happy to see her? Mad that her older sister is invading her school life during the term? What was the reason for not replying to Astoria?
"Come Tori. The carriages are waiting, and we mustn't keep Maxime waiting. You know how she gets when the horses get angsty." Fleur signaled to Astoria while grabbing the rest of her luggage and making her way out of the dorm room.
Before Astoria picked up her bag, she scanned the room for the last time this year. Astoria enjoyed sleeping next to Fleur in this room. It had nice lighting in the morning. Perfect for painting, drawing, or reading quietly. Astoria enjoyed painting and would often paint what she felt. If she were feeling anxious her paintings would be out of place and filled with colors that do not fit. If she were feeling sad, a lot of the canvas would be empty, colorless, lifeless, nothing to show for. She would hope someone would notice her emotion through her artwork. So far, no one has picked up on her hidden signals through her art. Maybe someday.
Astoria stepped into the carriage and the ladies were taking shots of pink colored vodka and cheering to the Triwizard Tournament. Astoria accepted a shot glass and smiled at her friends. She knew things were going to be different in England, and she was not sure if she was prepared for a culture shock.
  
    Chapter Text
    1994Astoria stepped out of the magical carriage and found herself standing in front of an enchanted castle. She found herself admiring the view from a nearby edge. She caught sight of a few of the Hogwarts students, some of them were young and many seemed to be around her age. Astoria pondered on why they were wearing such long, gaudy, robes. She was not in France anymore. The Beauxbaton ladies wore a light blue hat, followed by a jacket and a form fitted skirt. Many girls, including Astoria, wore heels with stockings and some just wore the Maryjane heels that were approved by the dress code. Madam Maxime preferred her girls to look like proper well-dressed ladies, so she was adamant with her dress codes."Alright ladies you are to wait here until we are called upon. A select few of you are to do the entering dance and the rest will follow." Madam Maxime stated, and turned on her heel to face the doors, preparing for them to open.Astoria was one of the girls that prepared for the dance. She found it rather silly that Madam Maxime wanted the girls to do a dance, but Astoria never passed up an opportunity to show off her skills. Astoria was an accomplished ballet dancer for a while, she gave up dancing years ago to focus on her art. However, Madam Maxime had remembered Astoria performing in a few shows at the academy, so she asked her personally to participate today. The sequence was quite easy, a few mere steps and a butterfly charm to dazzle the Hogwarts students.Astoria heard the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, make the announcement for the girls to enter and they started to file in. Astoria did the sequence and she locked eyes with a few students, but only a few caught her attention. Astoria was not interested in proper English men; she would prefer a French man for their hopeless romantic personalities."Fleur, let us go exploring the grounds! I am dying to see what our new home is going to be like for the next year." Astoria pleaded as she tugged on Fleur's forarm.Fleur pondered about her friends request and said, "You know we're not supposed to leave the dorms after curfew. Madam Maxime will have our heads. You can go, but I am staying. No way am I getting sent back to France before I even have a chance to enter the tournament."Astoria let out a huff of frustration and decided to go on her own. She put on a blue Beauxbaton jumper, grabbed her cigarettes and strode out the door to explore the grounds at night.Astoria walked along the castle halls until she could find an exit. She desperately needed a cigarette. She has not had one since she left the academy. Astoria developed the habit of smoking from her ex-lover. He was an Italian wizard who constantly kept her on her toes with anxiety, and one day handed her a pack and told her to "calm down." That was a year ago. She has smoked everyday since.Astoria sat outside on a ledge, taking drags of her cigarette and looking up at the sky. She was worried about when she would see Daphne. Is she going to be happy to see her? Astoria had not seen her at the entrance ceremony. Was Daphne avoiding her sister or was it a coincidence she was absent for Astoria's arrival?After a few more moments of being alone with her thoughts Astoria decided to head back to her chambers and retire. Just as she turned a dark corner she ran into a solid human figure." Bloody hell! Fucking watch where you're going." Sternly said the pale figure standing before her."Oh-sorr- wait what the hell did you just say to me?" Astoria said while staring up at the man before her."I said.." the pale figure inched closer to Astoria's face. "Watch where you are fucking going next time you bobble-head Beauxbaton." The blond boy spat. With that the figure brushed against her side and left.Astoria huffed and leaned her back against the stone wall. "Welcome back home to England, Astoria. It appears I made my first friend." Astoria whispered to herselfAstoria was excited to be back home in England. When she turned eleven her mother pushed her to study in France, and every so often Astoria would return for holidays, but not every year. Astoria spent most of her time painting, attending opera's and learning French culture. She even picked up on the language during her studies. Astoria was an accomplished young pupil and all the instructors said she was going to be someone great. They had no idea what lied ahead for her future.The next morning Astoria awoke and found Fleur sitting up in her bed reading her book. She was thinking about her run-in encounter with the blond boy from the night before. Astoria could not wrap her head around how rude he was towards her."How was your expedition last night? Find anything interesting?" Fleur inquired lowly whilst turning the page in her book."No, I smoked a cigarette, sat on a ledge enjoying the air, and just as I was leaving, I accidently bumped into this extremely bastard of a guy. Basically, told me to fuck off for bumping into him. I thought Englishmen were supposedly more proper than any other breed of men?" Astoria murmured."Merlin, what a jerk. Well, maybe you will not have to see him again. If he said that to you before even knowing you, he probably treats everyone like that. We are guests of Hogwarts and I am sure the headmaster informed the students to welcome us with open arms. I guess some just didn't get the message." Fleur said while giving her friend a reassuring grin.Astoria made her way down to the great hall where the goblet of fire was located and along side her were her friends, Fleur and Lilla. Lilla was smuggling a bottle of French wine under her arm and she told Fleur to take a few sips before putting her name into the fire. Fleur took a swig out of the bottle, smiled and trotted over the goblet and put her parchment into the goblet. It was done. The girls sat on the nearby benches watching other students put their name into the fire."Come on Cedric!" "Put it in!" A few of the Hogwarts students were chanting as this brunette-haired boy made his way up to the fire and put his name in. His eyes met Astoria's and they looked at one another for a few seconds. He smiled at her and he walked out."Tori! Did you hear me?" Lilla said while handing Astoria the bottle of wine."I'm sorry Lill. What did you say?" Astoria took a secret swig of the wine and handed it off."I saw that you know. You locked eyes with that Hufflepuff. You best be careful and not make any attachments here. We are only here for a year and then we go back to the academy." Lilla said while arching her eyebrow toward Astoria. Astoria rolled her eyes and kept on with the conversation."Viktor Krum!" "Cedric Diggory!" "Fleur Delacour!" and "Harry Potter!"The champions were selected, and her best friend Fleur was officially a TriWizard champion. To her surprise so was the Hufflepuff Astoria locked eyes with a few days ago at the great hall. Fleur informed her friend group that there was to be a party in the Slytherin common room, and the champions and their friends were invited. Astoria was determined to get terribly drunk. She and her friends had not been at a good party in a long awhile and this was her time to mingle. Astoria wore a black form fitting skirt, along with stockings and black high heels. She decided to wear a green silk revealing shirt to fit the aesthetic of the Slytherin common room. Her friends were all dressed in less than they should be, but they were young and free, so they thought why not?A Slytherin boy met the girls outside the common room to lead them in. The boy muttered the password, pureblood, and the girls stepped through the hallway to find over sixty students drinking, smoking, and dancing on each other. She even caught sight of a few students making out in a dark corner. The girls decided to take shots to get the night going.Astoria led Fleur to the dance floor and grinded against her to grab everyone's attention. Astoria loved being the center of attention wherever she went so she was determined to be the talk of the night. Just as she was taking a sip of her drink out of her red cup, she saw him. His brown hair, his tall figure, and his striking smile. She saw Cedric Diggory. Cedric caught the eyes of Astoria burning through him as he approached her.Cedric peered down at Astoria with a friendly grin and warm eyes. "I have never seen you here before. You must be one of the Beauxbaton girls." Cedric smiled down at her.Cedric seemed to be almost six foot and Astoria was only 5'1. Sometimes 5'5 if her heels were high enough."It would appear so. My name is Astoria. Astoria Greengrass." She said lowly. Astoria felt her cheeks flush and she caught her breath. Astoria looked up at him and smiled. She noticed how handsome Cedric was and how desperately she wanted to keep talking with him."Blimey, where are my manners. Would you care for another drink Ria?" Cedric stated cheerfully.Astoria nodded and watched the tall brunette strut across the room to the bar cart. She could feel other students eyes on her as she waited for Cedric to return. Cedric returned and handed her a glass of red sweet wine. Astoria took a sip and bobbed her head to the music."Are you excited for the games? What an honor it is to be talking with a TriWizard champion." Astoria winked at Cedric and a chuckle left his lips. His lips. Astoria could not stop looking at them, especially in her drunken state. Something about his man interested her, and his presence felt so comforting."I am more excited that I have the honor of talking with such a breathtakingly beautiful Beauxbaton lady." Cedric said boldly while eliminating the space between them. Astoria felt her heart begin to race and her breathing begin to become more deep."Tell me, Ria, how do you fancy Hogwarts so far?" Cedric inquired while sipping his drink."I love it! However, there was a slight odd encounter with a rude student last night, but other than-"
"Do you know who?" Cedric interjected sharply while furrowing his brows.
Astoria knew who it was, but she did not want to point him out of the crowd. The man that bumped into her last night did not seem as if he wanted to be bothered with her petty problems. She peered around the room and squinted her eyes. She noticed a pale, blond figure that kept looking her way, but never noticed until now. Astoria knew she was being watched.
"I do and I do not. I would rather not stir up trouble. I think I am going to return to my chambers. The drink is going to my head." Astoria said.
"Would you like some company?" Cedric inquired lowly.
Astoria nodded and she felt her cheeks blush once more. As they were leaving Cedric guiding her out and she felt more eyes on her. Perhaps students were surprised that a Beauxbaton was leaving with a TriWizard champion from Hogwarts. No matter, Astoria felt content.
Cedric and Astoria walked through the halls and he pointed out different paintings while explaining the history behind them. Astoria enjoyed art history and would love to spend her life creating and learning about famous artists. The couple reached the wing of the castle where the Beuxbaton's were staying and the air became slightly tense.
"Well, here we are. You cannot go further, there is a charm that Madame Maxine put over the dormitories to not allow male visitors.." Astoria said lowly while pushing a piece of hair out of her face.
Cedric laughed lowly and ran his fingers through his own hair.
"Erm— goodnight then.." Astoria said and as she was turning around she felt Cedric take her hand.
"Goodnight, Astoria." He said lowly.
"Goodnight, Cedric.." She replied.
Cedric took her hand and rubbed his thumb along her jawline. Before she knew it her lips were connected with his. The kiss was quick, but it lacked something Astoria did not realize yet.
She gave him one last glance before she shut the door.

    1994
"Have you seen that boy you were snogging at the Slytherin party? He was quite a cutie, wasn't he?" Lilla said while winking and showing a slight smirk on her lips.
"I've seen him here and there. I am not interested in a steady boyfriend. Plus, Cedric has the games to think about. He should not be distracted with the likes of me. I also have to focus on schoolwork and working on my legilimency."
"Oh right. Do you always have to do your parents bidding? It seems as if they put a lot on your shoulders Tor- "
"Welcome class to Defense Against the Dark Arts. I am Professor Moody, and you shall call me Moody." Mad Eye Moody was a friend of Dumbledoor's and was asked, personally, to teach the students about defense against dark spells.
Astoria scribbled down a few notes until she felt a piercing pain in her head. It felt as if someone was plunging into her skull with a knife, and she let out an intense yelp.
"Miss. Greengrass do you need to be taken to see Madam Pomfrey?" Moody looked over at Astoria with concern.
"No-No I am fine. My head is just spinning. I am sorry Moody may I please excuse myself to the lavatory?" Astoria held her head and ran into the girl's lavatory.
Astoria ran into the girl's lavatory and examined herself in the mirror. She ran her fingers through her scalp and could not figure out what just happened. The pain had subsided, but she heard a ring in her ears. Just as she was about to retreat a girl appeared from the corner of the bathroom. She had brown curly, bushy hair and was carrying more books than she should. She was a Gryffindor student.
"Can I help you in anyway? Your scream sounded intense. If you do not want to see Madam Pomfrey, I can run a quick diagnostic spell on you. I am no healer, but I have read many books on the subject." The kind girl approached her and was just about to wave her wand to run the diagnostic until Astoria grabbed her wrist.
"No. No thank you. I do not need a diagnostic ran on me. I shall be fine. Probably, just had a bag migraine attack. Are you in my class or something?"
"Yes I am. My name is Hermione Granger. You're from the Beauxbaton Academy correct?"
"Indeed. I traveled here with Fleur and a few of my other friends. We are here to support out champion and take part in the games."
Hermione glanced down to Astoria's neck to admire the green emerald necklace she was wearing.
"Wow. That is a gorgeous necklace... I apologize I do not know your first name."
"I am Astoria and thank you. It is a family emerald necklace."
Astoria held up her necklace and it was indeed a moderately sized green emeraled with a gold snake wrapped around the top. Astoria's father had given it to her when she first went to France to study magic. Her father told her to not forget where she came from, she did not know what he meant, yet.
A few days had passed since Astoria's migraine episode in DADA (Defense Against The Dark Arts) class and she was determined to find the brunette boy she was snogging at the party.
Astoria was taking a walk along the grounds and then she noticed Him. She decided to practice her legilimency and try and lure Cedric to a nearby pond.. to discuss if he had a plan for the next task. She glanced over to him and was able to get inside his head, quite easily. She was a little disappointed that he did not put up a fight, but she took it at a triumph.
"Want to take a walk with me to the pond next to the big oak tree?"
Cedric jolted upward and looked around for the woman who was invading his mind, until he locked eyes with Astoria and gave her a smile.
"You are full of surprises. I did not know you were skilled at legilimency. Sure. Let's go. Lead the way, darling."
Astoria picked up her bag and swung it over her shoulder and walked toward the big oak tree.
Cedric pushed her up against the oak tree and connected their lips. She felt his hands run up her back gently and feel her figure. Astoria pushed her tongue inside his mouth and lightly sucked on his bottom lip.
Astoria looked up at the brunette with intent and a slight smirk. Her eyes raging with lustful hunger. She could not understand why she fancied this man. She had never done anything this fast with any other man. She was always the type to give them a taste and leave the men wanting more, but never giving it to them.
"Touch me." Astoria whispered into Cedric's ear. His eyes either looked surprised or scared, but that did not mean his actions subsided. Cedric picked up Astoria and put both his hands on her bottom and squeezed tightly. Astoria let out a small whimper and was enjoying the moment. Cedric lightly laid Astoria down onto the grass and began kissing her passionately, lightly. Their eyes connected. Their heartbeats were in sync. She wanted to keep going. To feel every inch of him, but something stopped them. Cedric opened his mouth and said, "I'm sorry I cannot."
Cedric rushed to stand up and began pacing.
"Ria. I am so sorry. I should not have led you on. That night at the party I was do drunk and- "
Astoria enjoyed that Cedric gave her the nickname of "Ria" since everyone in her life either called her Astoria or Tori. She did not really like Tori, but she never corrected anyone, but Ria had a nice ring to it.
"What do you mean you led me on? Cedric look at me. You look at me as if you burn for me. What is the issue?"
"I-...I-...I am currently seeing someone in Ravenclaw. We have been together for a few months and I do care for her."
Astoria's eyes widened and she let out a laugh. She was very hurt but the only sound she could make was a heartbreaking laugh.
"Who."
Cedric turned and shook his head. He did not want to disclose his girlfriend's identity.
"I know we have not known one another long but I deserve to know who your girlfriend is since you've been snogging me for weeks!"
Cedric again shook his head and began to walk away from Astoria when she whipped out her hand and muttered the spell legilimency.
Astoria dove into Cedric's mind to find out who this girl was. He was on the ground in pain, but she needed to know. Cedric was not skilled at keeping Astoria out of his mind, so she was able to navigate herself through his memories quite easily.
"You are mine my dear. We shall be happy."
"You are mine, Cedric."
Astoria found a memory with the mystery girl. She was wearing a navy-blue crew neck with her house name and her brown hair wrapped around her face. Astoria's face fell when the girl in his memory turned around and she saw her eyes. Astoria pulled out of his mind and almost punched him square in the face.
"You bastard! I don't believe this!" Astoria stormed off leaving Cedric on the ground barely able to move from the intense spell.
Astoria realized the girl Cedric cared for deeply was indeed her sister, Daphne. Daphne was a brown haired Ravenclaw girl and with a flick of her wand Astoria apparated to the castle entrance was determined to find her sister. She had not seen her sister yet, but it was time for her to show her face.
Astoria grabbed the first Ravenclaw student she could and told them to have Daphne Greengrass meet her in the greenhouse. No one would be in there at this time and she wanted privacy.
Astoria made her way down to the greenhouse and waited a few minutes until she appeared. The girl who had what she wanted.
"Welcome to Hogwarts sister." Daphne walked toward Astoria and kept her hands together in the front of her.
"Daphne. We have matters to discuss. First off, you did not reply to my letter, regarding my arrival to England."
"I felt it was unnecessary to answer since no matter what you would arrive."
Astoria and her sister never met eye to eye. Daphne was jealous of Astoria for her beauty, her skill in art and her natural skill at being a talented witch. Daphne had to work for her knowledge and her parents did not pay as much attention to her as they did her sister.
"Is this all you wanted to discuss with me? If so, I have more pressing matters to attend to. I have a potions essay that is not going to write itself."
Astoria decided not to crumble her sister's social life at that moment but instead to let the issue lie. She would still have Cedric one way or another, but she wanted Cedric to look like the arse and not her. Astoria still desired a friendship with her sister. So, she chose her words carefully.
"I just wanted to make amends, sister. Since I will be staying here for the year, I feel we should be civil to one another and maybe we can repair what we once had. We have never been cruelling to one another and I think we could- "
"Yeah well, you left me with mother and father while you went off to study in France. Now you have a fancy French education, and I am still as I was. Just an adequate witch. Stay away from me Astoria. I do not wish to see you. I made a life for myself here. I have friends and man who cares for me." Daphne turned on her heel and exited the greenhouse.
Astoria felt her blood boil and she had a new plan. Win Cedric over her sister. It should not be difficult since she has already partly done it.
  
    Chapter Text
    1999Astoria awoke the next morning with her stomach in knots and her head clouded by memories. She slid off the bed and her feet touched the cold hardwood floor of the manor. It took her a few seconds to remember she was no longer at home; she was inside the house of her betrothed. Astoria fiddled with the emerald necklace around her neck and just as she was about to playback the memory hidden within the jewel her owl flew in from the window barring a letter.My Darling girl,I hope you are adjusting to your new surroundings. I know this a trying time for you, given the circumstances, but I have all the faith in you that you will fulfill your duties. The Malfoy's were in high ranks with the Dark Lord and a marriage with their son will ensure your future in society.Your mother
EloiseAfter Astoria read the letter, she immediately tossed it into the fireplace. It is too dangerous for prying eyes to read the letters she receives. She heard a figure approaching her door, followed by a series of faint knocks."Miss. Greengrass? Have you risen? May I come in please?"Astoria realized it was Narcissa and she scurried over to her dresser and placed a white robe around her body to cover her night dress.Astoria approached the door, turned the knob, and revealed Narcissa's hopeful eyes."Good morning Mrs. Malfoy. How are you on this fine morning?" Astoria signaled for Narcissa to come in and take a seat across from her at the fireplace."I am quite fine dear thank you, and please, you are to be my future daughter-in law call me Narcissa.""I was always taught by my mother, until a girl is married, she must not address her future mother-in-law by her name, but if you insist I shall abide. I would also prefer if you called me Astoria. Soon I will no longer be a Greengrass, so my first name is sufficient." Astoria sipped her tea the house elf dropped off for the two ladies and suddenly the air became stale. There seem to be a touch of tension.Narcissa leaned in further to confide with the young blond sitting across from her."Allow me to apologize on behalf of my son. He has not been adjusting well to the news. I do not understand why he is so adamant about not being married, but since the arrangement is done, there is nothing more can say about it."Narcissa looked down with a guilty facial expression because she was lying. Astoria knew why Draco did not want to marry her. It was not because he had reserved thoughts about marriage but rather reserved about marrying Astoria."If you would pardon me Narcissa I think I shall prepare myself for the day." Astoria sad while setting the tea cup down and rising from the armchair. Narcissus following her example."Of course, my dear. Perhaps later you shall join Draco and I for some tea on the terrace?" Narcissa stated as she was walking toward the door."That would be lovely. See you then, Narcissa." Narcissa showed herself out and Astoria quickly ran to her desk to write to her sister.Sister,I know we have not spoken in a long awhile but now more than ever I need you. I know you work along side healers in a hospital in England and I was wondering if you could send me some veritaserum. I need to recover some vital information. I implore that you set aside our differences and send me what I require. I would rather not have to ask the council for such a silly potion.No matter what happened in our past Daphne I still love you.Your Sister,
Astoria G.Astoria figured to ask for Veritaserum for a very clear reason. To extract vital information from her betrothed. Something did not feel right about how angry Draco was being toward Astoria. It almost feels like a front, like he is attempting to overwork his occlumency and shield information.Perhaps Astoria could pour the vial in his whiskey when his head was turned, or take him by force and pour it down his throat. Both options seemed easily done.At this point Astoria had very few allies. She needed to perceive with caution. It seems as though the only people she had on her side was Lilla and her mother, Eloise.Lilla knew of her situation and she understood how detrimental it was for Astoria to succeed at her task. The task of the union with Draco Malfoy.Her head slowly began to ache. So much to think about. Astoria was prone to migraines since she was teenager so some constant head pain was not surprising.She downed a cranial pain relief potion and slapped on some striking red lips, and slipped into her heels.Astoria made her way through the hallways of the manor and observing her surroundings. She noticed a painting of a particular woman. She was elegant, blond and was holding her wand next to her torso. Astoria approached the portrait and just as she was about to touch it, she felt someone touch her shoulder."Are we exploring our surroundings?" A cold, hardened voice stated from behind Astoria causing her to jump.
It was Lucius Malfoy."Oh- Oh, I am sorry Mr. Malfoy I was only just observing this portrait. She is quite beautiful." Astoria hesitantly stated while trying to create some space between her and Lucius."Yes, she was. The lady in the painting was my mother. She died during the first war, right before she went out to battle, she had this painting made of her. Almost... as if she knew she were not to return home." Lucius was almost touching noses withAstoria he was so close. She felt his cold breath on her face and the only thought she had was how fast she could flee the situation. Astoria gathered her thoughts and said the first thing come to mind."What a tragic tale. If you could please excuse me. Your wife and son are expecting me for tea out on the terrace." Astoria began to walk away when Lucius grabbed hold her hand."Have a splendid time, my dear. Do allow me to apologize for my sons rude behavior lately. Given the... history.. between the two of you, I figured he would be more open to the idea." Lucius formed a smirk on his face and exited the scene. Leaving Astoria uncomfortable and bewildered.She knew Lucius Malfoy was a bastard of a man, and a disgusting human but she was not pleased to know she was only seen as a "thing" being secured for another human. She was no a pawn on a chess board and she would not be moved around by someone else's command.Astoria scurried down to the doors of the outside to find Draco and Narcissa casually sipping tea and glancing around the grounds of the manor."Did you somehow get lost?" Draco said to her without making eye contact with her.Narcissa nudged Draco's arm and signaled for Astoria to have a seat at their table.Astoria sat next to Draco sipping on her tea when a house elf popped up and said, "There is a package with the Miss name on it. Seems to be from D.G. Shall I leave it on Miss's bed?"Astoria immediately replied with, "Ah! Yes, thank you. Please leave it upon my bed. I shall tend to it later." She said while signaling to the elf excitedly."Who is D.G?" Narcissa asked."My sister, Daphne." Astoria stated quickly.Astoria noticed Draco's temple twitch when she said her sisters name.After tea she rushed up the stairs and placed the veritaserum in a secure place where no one could find it.She heard someone bust through her door without announcement. It was her pale, blond fiancé."What did dear Daphne send you Astoria? Some perfume? A pair of shoes perhaps? I know you have not said a word to your sister in over a year, and all of a sudden, a mysterious package arriving for you from her? Quite interesting." Draco slowly approached Astoria.
Their chests were almost touching. Draco's eyes were dark, and his face was stern. She did not know if he was going to hex her or throw her onto the bed and kiss her.Astoria looked up into his grey eyes with intent and began making the faintest smirk on her face."Now, now, dear Draco. Let us not get our panties in a wand over a mere package from my sister. She only sent me some migraine medicine because I wrote my mother about my constant headaches. My mother must have asked Daph to send me some relief potions." Astoria replied with a sarcastic tone. An easy way out for a lie.Draco stared down at Astoria and he knew she was lying. Astoria stood her ground, while still smirking at him, almost taunting him with her eyes."Is there anything else you need to question me about, dearest?" Astoria cocked her head to the side and kept her voice sounding innocent.Draco stormed off and slammed the door behind him.

    1994Astoria looked at herself in the mirror of her dormitory bathroom and regarded how her body had changed over the past year. She wished she had a skinner body type; she wanted her legs to be long and her chest to be larger. Astoria was a short young woman, merely 5'2. She often wore heels to hide her height, but it was getting difficult when all her friends were over 5'5 and she was still the same height she was two years ago. Astoria had insecurities like any teenage girl, but she always had her mother's voice in her head saying, "You are perfect. You are the epidemy of elegance my girl." She did not feel elegant. She slapped on a smile and walked out to find Fleur was dressing for potions class."Morning Tori. I am off to my potions class. Would you like to meet at the hall for dinner tonight?" Fleur asked while pulling a Beaubaxton Academy blue crewneck over her chest.Fleur was more endowed than Astoria might ever be. Fleur had a nice figure, along with long blond, wavy hair. Astoria' s hair was also blond but over the past year she kept it blond. She wanted to blend in better and all boys love a sweet smiled blond girl."Okay. I must do some studying for DADA in the library after divination though. I will meet you after I am done." Astoria applied some nude-colored lipstick to her face and began walking to her first class, Transfiguration. Transfiguration was one of Astoria's best courses at the Beauxbaton Academy of Magic, so she was excited to see how the schools differed in teaching methods. "Good morning class. Today we are going to start off the year with some advanced magic. You are going to pair up and turn your partner into a harmless animal." McGonagall said sternly. The older witch began to pair up the students and she finally made her way over near Astoria."Greengrass and Malfoy. Over here." McGonagall pointed to a nearby corner.Astoria looked at her partner and she felt like she knew him from somewhere. She did not know his first name and she has not seen him around, or she merely had never noticed him until now. He was in Slytherin house, had platinum blond hair, grey piercing eyes and a smirk that could kill."Well, well. Looks like it is my lucky day." The blond boy spat out while leaning against the wall next to Astoria."Erm... sorry? I am afraid I do not understand." Astoria said while peering down at her old Transfiguration notes."It is not every day I get paired up with a fine French girl with yet an English accent." The pale man smirked while looking at Astoria."Well, maybe if you had done your research you would realize I am not a true French girl. My mother is French, but my family resides in England." Astoria began reaching for her textbook when the pale boy abruptly approached her and stood millimeters from her face."I do not need to do research. I know who you are Greengrass." Malfoy spat while smirking."Astoria." She said while looking up at him. She realized how tall he was while he was looking down upon her.The blond boy paused and took a step back."Malfoy.""I am going to turn you into a mere mouse. How does that sound?" Astoria inquired lowly.Malfoy snorted and threw his arms in the air."Frappe-moi avec ton meilleur coup." Malfoy said while smirking. Astoria was slightly taken aback that this boy knew how to speak French, but by the way he dressed she knew he was aristocratic. So, in other ways it did not surprise her that he was cultured."If you say so." Astoria said while pointing her wand at the blond.Astoria left her class and went into the girl's lavatory. She wondered where she knew Malfoy. Was he a family friend? Had she seen him around the great hall? Astoria lit a cigarette and then realized. Her first night in the castle, when she sneaked out for a smoke, it was him. The boy whom she bumped into and was extremely rude to her. She still had not even known his first name yet, but she knew already she did not like him. His cockiness, his demanding nature, and his piercing, beautiful, eyes. She took a puff from her cigarette and walked out of the lavatory, right before bumping into a hard chest with a yellow tie around it."Ria." The deep voice said above her."Cedric." Astoria said while looking up. Her heart started racing, and she felt her palms become slightly moist.Cedric began walking away when Astoria grabbed his left hand."Cedric. Please I need to talk with you. I need to apologize for my behavior. I never should have invaded your memories. That was wrong of me and I apologize." Astoria looked up at the brunette with sorrowful eyes and a blameful expression on her face."I forgive you, Ria. All I ask is that next time you think before you act. I would like us to be friends. I did not know Daphne was your sister. I never would have started snogging you if I would have known. Frankly, I should not have been snogging anyone except her, but my relationship with your sister is complicated right now and... I do not know why I am explaining this all to you- ""No! It is fine!" Astoria interjected. "I am here talk if you need a friend. If you are not busy now would you like to accompany me for a snack outside? I have half an hour before potions." She said while batting her eyes at his.Cedric agreed and followed Astoria outside. They found a patch of grass near a tree and they began talking like best friends."I care for your sister a lot, and we have been together for a while, but I feel as if something is missing or amiss. When I look into her eyes, I do not see what I once saw. Daphne is a determined young girl but sometimes I feel I do not fit into her plans." Cedric said while lowering his head, but Astoria lifted it back up."My sister has always had her own agenda, and so have I. I guess it is the Greengrass blood. We see what we want, and we go for it, no matter who is in our way." Astoria looked up at the sky and wondered, just for a moment, what would happen if Cedric would kiss her right there, but she knew it was wrong. She knew she wanted Cedric, but she also knew she wanted a good relationship with Daphne. If Cedric was to choose Astoria over Daphne, then the blame would be on Cedric and not Astoria."I am not sure what to do about Daphne. Sometimes I feel as if she does not want me around anymore, then other times she's regarding me like I am the only person in the world she sees." Cedric began looking down and took a bite out of an apple he had in his satchel."The person you are with should be looking at you with a look that says, 'I see you and I burn for only you.' I feel that if you care about someone you should be showing that you care for them every single day, no?" Astoria looked at Cedric and for a moment he was looking deeply into her eyes and started to lean in but stopped himself."Thank you for listening and for the advice Ria. You're a good friend." Cedric picked up his satchel and left.Astoria rolled her eyes and laid down on the grass and muttered the word "friend" under her breath. She lit another cigarette, glanced at her watch and realized she was late to meet Fleur for dinner."I'm sorry doll, time got away from me." Astoria said while taking a seat at the Beauxbaton Academy table."It's okay Tor, we just started eating." Fleur said while sliding down to make room for her.The Beauxbaton girls had their own private table section in the great hall and would often find boys from Durmstrang glancing over every so often. It just made the girls laugh at their desperation."I hear there is to be a ball!" Annie said excitedly while spooning pudding into her mouth.Annie has been friends with Astoria for almost two years. She had black curly hair, dark brown eyes, a gorgeous figure, caramel skin, and she smelled like a vanilla candle."I just love balls." Quietly said Lilla.Lilla has known Astoria almost her entire life, and she has a... provocative personality type. She enjoyed talking boys, booze, and sex. She was also not opposed to a little drug escape now and again. Lilla had dirty blonde hair, green eyes, a thick body shape and she smelled of essential oils or cigarettes, depending on the day."Lill! You are vile." Fleur shouted as she threw a fork at Lilla.Astoria quietly chuckled to herself at her friend's obscene comment."What kind of a ball?" Asked Astoria."It's for us champions. You are to celebrate our victories and we are to enjoy a night of dancing, drinking and- ""Shagging!" Lilla stated abruptly, making the girls laugh together."It is the Yule Ball. It is going to be held in a matter of weeks. I am pretty sure it is just about all kids from all houses, and schools to meet and make friends." Annie said quietly."Time for us to get some dates ladies." Fleur stated while flicking her wand to clear her plate.Lilla began to stand up and ask if anyone wanted to go for a smoke and Astoria agreed and followed. It was quite cold outside at night, but the girls did not mind."What's troubling you Tori? I can see it in your eyes." Lilla asked while putting the cigarette between her teeth and reaching for her lighter."Daphne hates me, Cedric, the boy who I was snogging at the Slytherin party sees me as a friend, oh and he is dating my sister. I feel so out of place. I really liked him Lill. It is not fair." Lilla handed off the cigarette to Astoria and she took a large inhale and blew out the excess smoke."Fuck them Tori. You can have anyone you want. You are gorgeous. Forget Cedric and forget Daph. You know she always had a grudge against you for being your parent's favorite daughter."As the girls finished their cigarette, they made their way back up to the dorms. Lilla said goodnight to Astoria before returning to her own dorm."Fleur, what if I cannot find a date? Then I cannot attend the ball." Astoria glanced over at her friend while she changed into a night shirt and underwear."Astoria Greengrass. You will find a date I promise. Now the shut the hell up and go to sleep. We get to witness our first school quidditch game tomorrow. Should be exciting!" Fleur flicked her wand to turn off the lights."Which houses are playing again?""Slytherin versus Gryffindor. I hear they are two rival houses. Should be quite interesting."
  
    Chapter Text
    1994"Here, Fleur, hide this in your satchel..." Lilla handed Fleur a flask of fire whiskey. Lilla enjoyed pushing the boundaries of school rules.Once Lilla took a whole bottle of French wine to the Beauxbaton Dance recitals and got horrifically drunk that she ended up vomiting on the girl next to her. Lilla has a troubled past and she tries to ease her pain by drinking and indulging in a muggle herb called "marijuana." She only smokes it on special occasions because she must travel into Germany to find a certain herb of marijuana she likes. The street name for it OG Kush."Lill, I am not hiding a flask of whiskey in my satchel! Hide it in your bra like you always do." Fleur pushed the flask away from her, giving Lilla a disgusted look."Mom. It is too cold to put a flask in my bra. Come on, I cannot survive this game without getting a little buzz. Plus, everyone can take sips to make the next two hours more interesting!"Lilla would often refer to Fleur as "mom" because in a way, Fleur was the mother figure in the friend group, since she was the eldest. Lilla has never met her mother and Fleur has taken her under her wing she arrived at Beauxbaton, they were still best friends but those two had a special beyond."Give it here. I have plenty of room in my cloak. I can stash it in the inside pocket, but I get dibs on the first swig!" Astoria took the flask and hid it inside her blue colored cloak.Astoria was not feeling very conversational until the group made it to the quidditch stands. The stands were split into two, people who were rooting for Slytherin and people who were rooting for Gryffindor. The girls all looked a little confused and decided to sit with the Slytherin area because Lilla was friends with a girl in the house, her name was Pansy Parkinson.Pansy had long brown hair, brown eyes and had a thin physique. She seemed to also have a loudmouth by what Astoria gathered. Astoria had not met many students in Slytherin but since her encounter with Malfoy she was not too fond of the house."Welcome students to the Gryffindor versus Slytherin quidditch match! I would like to personally welcome our abroad students and thank them for participating in cheering on our students! May... the match... begin!" Lee Jordan, the commentator, exclaimed excitedly.Dumbledore released the golden snitch from the middle of the stands and quickly the two seekers began chasing after the little bugger.After about thirty minutes of watching players score points, get hit the bludgers and some knocked off their broom, a brunette-haired boy darted for the golden snitch."Ugh! Where the fuck is Draco? Saint Potter is going to catch the snitch and it is going to cost us the game!" Pansy shouted to her friend next to her. Her friend was Blaise Zabini. An attractive young man Astoria noticed but not her type."There! Pans! I see him! He is really flying fast!" Blaise pointed to the middle of the field and there he was. Draco Malfoy. The boy whom she bumped into.The boy who knew who she was in Transfiguration.He was the seeker for the Slytherin team. Of course, he was a jock. He was so full of himself that it just fit his persona."Potter and Malfoy are neck and neck! Whomever catches the snitch wins the game!" Jordan said while trying to catch up with the two seekers with his eyes."Astoria, would you like some firewhisky? You're shivering. It will warm you up really quick." Lilla offered her flask to Astoria and she gladly accepted. She noticed Lilla was already a little bit tipsy, but Astoria was not going to be the one to tell her to calm her drinking, she did not want to get punched by one of her good friends.Astoria took a swig from the flask and felt the burn of the fire whiskey run down her throat. She had not eaten yet today so after another swig she was feeling hazy."Hah! Isn't my honey amazing?" Pansy said to the group.The girls quickly glanced over to the group to realize Malfoy had been able to out fly Potter and knock him with a bludger to the chest. Potter had been knocked to the ground but was not removed from the game. This made Malfoy the only seeker currently on the field and the snitch was up for grabs.Astoria noticed Pansy called Malfoy her "honey." Did that mean they were dating? Was Malfoy even capable of holding a relationship? His ego was so huge how could he fit another person in his life."Are you two together?" Astoria asked Pansy with her head cocked."Well erm—not officially. We occasionally get really trashed together and shag up, but that boy has issues of his own to worry about to deal with any of mine. His shag game is pretty great though if you know what I mean Miss. Beauxbaton..." Pansy gave Astoria a wink and a flirty grin."What are all your names' ladies from France? I know you Miss. Triwizard champion, I know you, Lilla you crazy bitch, but I don't know this one or that one." Pansy pointed at Astoria and Gabrielle."I am Gabbrielle, and this is Astoria." Gabrielle extended her hand toward Pansy, and she accepted the handshake. Gabrielle was Fleur's little sister and she often followed Fleur around like a lost puppy."Astoria Greengrass? As in Daphne Greengrass' sister?""Yes, that is me." Astoria slightly became embarrassed because she did not want to be known as Daphne Greengrass' sister. Since especially not that her and her sister were not an excellent term."Slytherin Wins! Draco Malfoy has caught the snitch!" Lee Jordan shouted with a disappointed voice. He was obviously was Gryffindor."Wow! I cannot wait to ride that later if he lets me. Sometimes he gets on his man period, and he does not let me near him. Listen here, Miss. Greengrass you and I should be friends. I would love to get to know you. Since Slytherin has won the game there is bound to be a common room party tonight. Bring your firewhisky and your friend Lilla here, she knows how to party. Meet me outside the dungeon painting at 11:45 and I will let you into the common room." Pansy exited the stands with Blaise leaving Astoria and her friends in amazement."I have heard Pansy can be a real bitch, but she is very nice." Astoria said with her mouth almost hanging wide open."I don't know if you should go Tori. I have a terrible feeling about this. Don't you remember what happened at the last party? You started snogging Cedric, your sister's boyfriend and- ""That was different. It was one of our first nights in the castle and I was naïve. Plus, I have Lilla!" Astoria pulled her friend into a tight embrace and they both smiled at Fleur leaving her to shake her head."I don't condone this behavior, but I am not your parent so I cannot forbid you to go, just be cautious." Fleur murmured lowly while turning her head.It was eleven at night and Astoria was dressing for the party with Lilla.The girls decided to coordinate with their colors. Pansy told the girls to show up wearing green and black to blend in.Astoria was wearing dark blue jeans with knee high black velvet boots, and a green form fitted top with a v-neckline. Astoria wore her emerald necklace, along with her gold hoop earrings. She was dressed to impress.Lilla decided to wear a black laced body suit with a velvet green skirt, followed by black knee socks and some ankle boot heels. Both girls took two shots of firewhisky each to pregame for the event.Astoria felt her head become hazy, but she did not care. It was Friday night, and she was determined to let loose and have fun."Welcome to Slytherin, whores." Pansy said bravely.Pansy met the girls outside the dungeons and greeted them with a tight embrace. Astoria could tell Pansy took too many shots before the party started.Pureblood.Pansy whispered the password to the painting, and it opened slowly to reveal a dark hallway.Astoria went into this party with the mindset of having fun, getting drunk and not snogging anyone, especially Cedric. She secretly hoped he would be there just so she could show off her outfit and flirt with guys in front of him, hoping for some jealous behavior, but she quickly realized there were no other houses there besides Slytherin some men from Durmstrang and a few other Beauxbaton's."Come on. Let us take some shots and get this night going." Pansy led the girls over to the bar table and the girls downed two more shots of firewhisky.Astoria's vision became slightly blurry if she did not fully focus in. She felt herself wobble until a tall being stood behind her with blond hair."Well... well. Look who we have here. What are you doing at my party Greengrass and erm – whomever the hell you brought with you?" A cold, shaking voice said behind her.He was behind Astoria, basically keeping her stable from falling over. She felt her heart begin racing, but why? He made her nervous. His voice. His façade.It was all intimidating. Fucking Merlin, why was this man gorgeous?"Lilla and I were invited here Malfoy by your wonderful seee—-xx buddy Miss. Parkinson." Astoria made her way over to Pansy and put her arm around her while laughing to herself. Astoria was drunk. A little too drunk for a teenage girl."Shhhh Astoria! Do not mention that. I don't want Draco here being scared off. I need him..." Pansy winked at Malfoy and his face became hard and angry. "How about we have a go ahead, huh' Draco? It has been a while..." Pansy said while almost wrapping herself around Malfoy.Malfoy grabbed Pansy's arm and whispered in ear. Pansy whispered back in his ear and the conversation made a drastic change of subject."Amazing game today wasn't it? Seems like the Slytherin seeker knew what he was doing. Impressive." Lilla said as she tried moving closer to Malfoy, but he was not interested so he just ended up ignoring her and switching the subject. Just as Pansy was about to fall all over Malfoy, the pale wizard called over another tall, dark haired boy, whom he called "Nott." Obviously another Slytherin. Nott took Pansy lightly by the arm and guided her over to a nearby chair.Astoria began to wander around the common room. Bumping into other students until she bumped into a brunette with friendly eyes."Hey- watch- watch-it dude." Astoria muttered while looking up."Ria? What are you doing here?" Cedric looked down at Astoria with confusion."What-What am I do-doing here? What-ar-yo- doin- here? Cee-dric?" Astoria could not focus her eyes on anything, so she kept scanning the boy in front of her."Alright. You are drunk. Come on I am taking you back to your dorm." Cedric grabbed hold of Astoria's arm and Astoria was not ready to leave."Get the hell off me! Don't you have my sister to attend to?" Astoria spat while trying to lunge her arm free."Please... Ria... let's- " Cedric pleaded."DO NOT call me Ria. My-mmmyyy name is Astoria. You do not have the right to call me Ria." She interjected sharply while pointing at his face (sort of)."Okay. Astoria. Let's go I am taking you out. You are falling all over yourself." Cedric began to grab a hold of Astoria's arms until she began to topple over. Astoria was on the ground until a pair of strong hands lifted her up. Pale. Strong arms and hands."Take care of your girl, Diggory. Isn't it bad enough you make a mockery out of one Greengrass girl and now you have to do the same to this one?" Malfoy spat in annoyance. Astoria was barely coherent as she was behind held up by Malfoy. Damn Firewhisky."I will take care of her Malfoy. I care for Ria. Now just let her go." Cedric spat.Malfoy shrugged his shoulders and let go. Astoria was back on the ground after being let go by Malfoy. If she was not intoxicated the fall may have hurt, but since she was over the moon it felt like she drifted."Come on baby. Let us get you out." Cedric said as he was picking up Astoria from the ground."My-my-sister. You're with my sister!" Astoria began whaling as she was being carried out of the common room and down the dungeon halls."Shhh... I'm not Ria. I realized I do not care for Daphne like that anymore. So, I need you to calm down." Cedric said in reassurance while cupping her face.Astoria was placed on a bench and was handed a vile with a sobriety potion label on it. She placed it to her side and realized she was not ready to give up her liquid courage yet. She noticed Cedric was next to her and she placed her head on his shoulders."You know. When I joined these games, I was doing it to impress your sister. She told me she wanted to be with someone who was brave, intelligent and a winner."Cedric took a pause and readjusted Astoria on his shoulder and laid her down on his lap so she could rest her head. She felt his hand in her hair, and he began to stroke little strands from her scalp. Astoria had her eyes closed but she was soaking up all this valuable time she had with him."I wanted to be someone who she could be proud of, but I now realize I am doing this for me and for my father. After my mother's passing it has always been me and my father. I would do anything to make him proud of me. What better way to do that than become a TriWizard champion with a fancy blue trophy in our living room?" Cedric slightly chuckled and was still stroking Astoria's hair slightly.Astoria sat up. Looked Cedric in his eyes and smiled.It was a warm, friendly smile that indicated a gratitude for his candor.Astoria raised the sobriety potion to her lips and downed it. She looked up and Cedric was still looking at her."I need you to kiss me." He said looking hopeful.Astoria pondered if this was the right decision. She had done this before, and it ended badly."Cedric. I do not know- I—want to but last time the situation got out of hand with my sister. I can't kiss you and pretend not to know you the next day." Astoria said while wiping one tear from her eye.Cedric bowed his head and thought about his next statement carefully it seemed."You make me feel warm and giddy. You make me cheeks swell up and I get excited when I see you in the halls. I was so excited to kiss you at the last party that I forgot about your sister. Ria you are taking over my mind. Your lips are so close to mine that I cannot think of anything else right except connecting them."Water started to pool in Astoria's eyes because she had the same thoughts as him."Kiss me, Astoria."Astoria slowly leaned her face into Cedric's and was on cloud nine. Cedric put his hand behind Astoria's neck and connected their lips slowly. She felt bliss.Cedric began slightly tugging on her neck and biting on her lower lip. Astoria lifted her hands up his chest and felt his chest. His heart was beating faster than a rabbit.She thought to herself how cute that was. But she did she want something that was cute?Astoria decided to escalate things and climb onto his lap and thrust her body toward him hoping he would grab her hips onto him. She felt her lower abdomen begin to burn and pulse. She felt the fire within her, and she was acting on it.With every kiss the couple shared she hoped his hands would creep up her shirt and cup her breast, but nothing.Astoria thought Cedric may need another hint to where she wanted to take the situation.Astoria ran her hands down his chest and began to play with his belt buckle. She felt his pants begin to harden and a faint smile grew on her lips as she heard low groans leave Cedric's mouth.He was slightly moaning into her mouth."Touch me." She muttered.Cedric began to put his hands on her back and run his fingers up and down her spine. She paused the passionate kiss and whispered in his ear while holding his hand."Not there." Astoria said lowly. She took his hand and put it under shirt, and onto her breast. "Here." She demanded. Astoria bit her bottom lip as a sign of flirtation, but the look of worry came across Cedric's face.Cedric lifted Astoria off his lip and began pacing around the room."What is it? What's wrong?""Nothing Ria. It's just- you seem very set on shagging me here in this classroom."Astoria rose from the bench and walked over to him. She placed her hands on his trousers and began to slightly stroke outside his pants."Is that a bad thing? Would you think of me different if I asked you to take me right here, on this table, in this room?"Cedric grabbed Astoria and placed her on top of the table. She removed her shirt and his shirt. She muffled the silencing charm muffliato.She looked into Cedric's eyes as he was running his hand up and down her torso. She let out soft groans to signify pleasure.She opened her legs and pulled him in closer and smashed her lips against his while sliding her tongue into his mouth and massaging his tongue with hers."I'm ready. Do it." She whispered into his ear.She had never "made love" before, she was a virgin, so she did not know what to expect but all Astoria knew was she ready. A flash of guilt hit her when she thought about Daphne for a split second. Astoria felt horrible for shagging the man who she felt she cared for most. However, when she looked into Cedric's eyes, she knew he was hers, she was his.A fire burned for him in her lower abdomen.Cedric unbuttoned his trousers and ripped off Astoria's jeans. She felt his length and whispered into his ear, "I wanna know what it feels like."With that Cedric licked his fingers to moisten her opening and slid himself in. Astoria felt it all. Her insides being broken, blood beginning to slightly drain from her, but it felt utterly incredible. With every pulse she felt every inch of him. She heard his breath in her ear along with his soft groans. Astoria began to moan as he laid her down on the table, still pumping inside her."I am going to cum- Rrr—Ria." Cedric muttered. Already? What the hell—Astoria was not able to form another thought until he came undone inside her. Astoria tried not to look disappointed but it was flashed on her face. This man lasted what, thirty seconds? What a waste. Cedric came inside of her and the look of horror on his face when he did say it all.Cedric pulled up his trousers and raked a hand through his hair. "Fancy a walk?" He croaked out awkwardly.Cedric walked Astoria back to her dorm, planting a soft kiss on her forehead followed by a shy smile. She found Lilla sleeping on the couch and ended up waking her and helping her friend into bed.The next morning Fleur woke up Astoria and asked her to come down for breakfast. Astoria was starving. The only thing in her system was fire whiskey and a sobriety potion. The Beauxbaton girls were all sat at breakfast until they saw Daphne Greengrass storm into the great hall and her eyes aiming straight for Astoria. Astoria turned around and felt a slap hit straight across her face."You are a fucking cunt of a sister. You really did it. You fucked Cedric Diggory. MY Cedric! You whore!" Daphne yelled.Astoria scanned the room mortified and she found all eyes were on her. If her friend's mouths hung open any further, they would hit the table.  The sex was not even worth it, it seemed. Astoria could have casted a charm and it would have lasted longer than Diggory."Daph-I-um-Daphne I am so- ""Save it bitch." Daphne stormed out of the hall without another word.Lilla looked up from her eggs and her eyes straight on Astoria."You got dick last night!?" Lilla slightly screamed at her.Fleur was mad. Lilla was thrilled. Astoria was mortified. She buried her face in her hands and just wanted this day to end.
  
    Chapter Text
    1994The first task of the TriWizard tournament has concluded. All the champions have collected their eggs the dragons provided, and they are tasked with discovering the secret message within the egg.Fleur and Astoria were in the library discussing how to make sense of the screaming inside the egg."There must be some way to figure out this stupid egg. When you open it all it does is screech?" Astoria slammed the book she was reading shut out of frustration.Fleur was becoming more tense because she heard from the other champion, Harry Potter, and he had not been able to figure out the egg."I spoke to Harry. He seemed more worried than I was. We are all confused. I have not spoken to Viktor or Cedric... hey... perhap-perhaps you could speak to Cedric." Fleur kept her head facing down on her potions class notes and deliberately not making eye contact with Astoria since she brought up Cedric.Since the incident in the great hall with Daphne, Astoria and Cedric have kept their snogging secluded to classrooms, dark hallways and occasionally by the black lake.Astoria adored Cedric, but was heart broken how her sister found out about their companionship. There was no label on the relationship, except the couple were obsessed with one another.Cedric looked into Astoria's eyes like she was a beautiful flower blooming in adversity. Astoria looked into Cedric's eyes with happiness and lust."I can ask him. I am actually planning on meeting him for a little... study session after I am finished researching with you."The girls were silent for a few minutes and Astoria rose to her feet."I am going to head out. Do not wait for me for dinner, I am not very hungry. I will meet you back at the dorm later and let you know if Ced has any information on the egg."Fleur gave a short-wave goodbye and Astoria smiled at her, quickly departing the library to meet Cedric. She almost made it out of the archway until she tripped over her own two feet and her books, notes and quills went flying into the air."Dammit." Astoria quietly cursed to herself.She was reaching for her potions textbook until she saw a pair of leather men's shoes standing before her.It was Malfoy.Standing there in his Slytherin robes and his house tie.He looked down on Astoria and rose his left eyebrow."I never thought you would get on your knees for me so soon, Greengrass."Malfoy quietly chuckled to himself while not helping Astoria pick up her belongings."Trust me Malfoy. You will not find me on my knees for you." Astoria shot back."Oh, that's right. You prefer pussy Hufflepuff's with no backbone."Astoria rolled her eyes and pushed past the blond in front of her."He has more bravery in his pinky finger than you have in your whole body, Malfoy!" Astoria said loudly as she was exiting the scene.Astoria entered the hallway leading toward the Hufflepuff common room and there he was.Her champion.Cedric Diggory.Cedric turned his head and met her eyes and instantly smiled.Astoria trotted over to the brunette and instantly threw her arms around him locking him into a passionate kiss.Cedric wrapped his arms around her waist and picked her up slightly."Why, hello Ria. Happy to see me, are we?""I am always happy to see you." Astoria said while smiling up at him and planting yet another kiss upon his soft lips."Should we start studying? I figured we could start with DADA and- ""Actually. Before we start. I have to ask you something important." Astoria asked while interrupting him."Of course, Ria anything. What's on your mind?" Cedric took a seat on the nearby ledge and signaled for Astoria to join him."Well. You know that egg that you must figure out what message lies within it? Well, Fleur is having a rough time trying to figure out how to figure out how to get the message. So, I was wondering, if you had cracked the code yet?"Astoria felt a tad embarrassed for asking but she had no choice. Her friend needed her help desperately and she was not going to let her down."As a matter of fact, I do have a theory. I have not yet figured out the message inside, but I heard from a friend that if you place the egg inside hot water then you can receive the message.""Fascinating. So, when are you going to test your theory?" Astoria asked while grabbing his left hand and began to massage his thumb with hers."If you are free for the next hour, we can test it now if you like." Cedric asked while connecting his lips with Astoria's cheek."Where exactly are we supposed to do that?" Astoria slightly giggled with blushing.Cedric got up, extended his hand, and guided her upstairs to the prefect bathroom on the third floor.With a flick of his wand the water started flowing, the mermaid appeared on the stain glass window, and bubbles began to form.Cedric casted an endless warming water charm and put a locking charm on the bathroom.Astoria's eyes met with Cedric's as he walked toward her.She connected their lips for a passionate kiss and wrapped her arms around his neck. He put his hands on her back and began lifting her shirt, until it was above her head and finally off.Astoria lifted Cedric's shirt above his head and began unbuckling his belt and trousers.She began doing the same to her jeans until Cedric did it for her. His hands glided down to her underwear and he lightly pulled down and off.Astoria left another kiss on Cedric's lips and disconnected, looked up at him and said, "Should I swan dive?""Canon ball baby." Cedric said while making his way into the unusually large bathtub.Astoria made her way over to the ledge in nothing but her skin and winked at the brunette boy awaiting her company.She jumped into the air and made a large splash under the water.While she was under water, she saw everything he was. His length, and his arousal level, she swam over to him and slightly yanked on him.He raised her from the water and connected their lips. All the kisses shared between them were soft, passionate, and not very aggressive. Cedric was not an aggressive lover; he was very gentle and enjoyed endless amounts of innocent passion.Sometimes Astoria wished he were grabbing her hair, her behind or even put his hands around her neck. She was a dominate woman and sometimes she enjoyed being dominated by a man in the bedroom. She knew Cedric would never do such things to her, but maybe in due time, she could convince him.Astoria was on Cedric's lap and grinded carefully against him making him more aroused by the second."Fuck me." Astoria whispered into his ear.He seemed taken a back like he did not want to hear such things."Don't say that Ria. Shhh" Cedric connected their lips again for a soft kiss."I will make love to you, darling." Cedric said while inserting himself into Astoria.She let out a soft moan at the first feeling of the insertion.He grinded with her slowly in the water, not making many waves.She wanted something faster, harder, and deeper.She tried being rough with him, by grabbing his hair, biting his ear and trying to enhance the motion of his grind.He kept the slow motion and grinded inside her.She enjoyed everything she was feeling, she was just hoping for something more intense.With a few more thrusts Cedric threw his head back and finished inside of her.Astoria tried to hide her facial expression.She felt cheated.That was it?Where was the fun?She enjoyed the sex, but she was hoping for an orgasm of her own.Astoria never had an orgasm from a man before.Maybe Cedric was worried about the message inside the egg that he finished so quickly."That was great Ria. You're amazing." Cedric pulled her close and planted a kiss upon her lips."Now let's open this egg and see what we got."Some time had passed since the prefect bathroom.Fleur figured out the message inside the egg and was prepared for the next task.Astoria had not seen Daphne since the incident, but she knew her sister would avoid her if she could.Astoria knew she was wrong but who is she to intervene in between two people who care deeply for one another?Astoria knew she cared deeply for Cedric, but she knew she was not in love yet.What was love?Going to the ends of the Earth for someone?Loving someone even when you see all their wrongs and faults?The Yule ball was approaching, and Astoria was hoping Cedric would ask her to be his date, but he had not yet.She was going to see him for lunch so she could ask him then.She walked through the great hall doors and spotted the brunette Hufflepuff seated around his friends.She felt slightly nervous to approach him in front of everyone, but she was feeling confident today.She grabbed his arm and his head spun around."Oh. Hey Ria. Join us." Cedric cleared a space next to him for her to sit."Cedric, I know this may be a bit odd, but the Yule ball is quickly approaching, and I was wonder- ""Ria. We need to talk about that. Come on let us discuss in private. Excuse us guys." Cedric nodded at his friends and guided Astoria to a nearby corner that was unoccupied."Ria. I-I am sorry, but I cannot accompany you to the ball." Cedric looked down in shame."What? Why? I thought we were- ""Ria we are, but as a champion we had to let McGonagall know ahead of time who our dates were. I am going with Daphne. I'm sorry darling."Astoria's chest felt heavy. She wanted to cry. All she wanted was to dance with the man she cared for most. But she now realized her sister would get that dream."I have to go." Astoria pushed past him and began to make her way back to the dorms until she heard her name being called out by an unfamiliar voice."Hey! You-you're Astoria, right?" The boy was medium sized height, brown hair, circle glasses and a odd scar on his forehead."Uhm- yes I am. You are?""Harry. Harry Potter. I was just wondering if you had a date for the ball yet. I know you are from Beauxbaton and must have tons of lads asking you but- "Astoria cut him off and accepted his offer. She was thrilled to have a date."Brilliant! Can I walk you to your dorm Astoria?" Harry smiled at her with kindness and began walking."You may and please, call me Tori. All my friends do!" Astoria quickly realized how nice this boy was.He was one of the champions and she was surprised he did not have a date to the ball yet."Thank you for walking me Harry. Perhaps we can grab breakfast sometime soon to chat and get to know one another." Astoria smiled at the brunette boy in front of her."Yeah, okay, sure! See you soon Tori."Astoria entered her dorm room to find, Fleur, Lilla and Pansy all talking in a circle on the floor. They were discussing their dates to the ball and what they were going to wear."I will be in a red dress of course. I do enjoy showing off what I do not have." Lilla said while lighting up a joint of marijuana."I will be wearing a silver-colored dress. Something modest since I am a champion." Fleur passed the joint to Pansy since she did not partake in smoking."Well I have to wear a black dress. If I show up in color Draco will have my head. He prefers me in black so I shall oblige to whatever honey wants." Pansy took a large inhale of the joint and exhaled.Pansy was going to the ball with Draco Malfoy.Interesting.Astoria wondered if we would be a good dancer.Would he be wearing dress robes?Would his hair be perfectly combed and out of his face?Why was she wondering about Draco Malfoy?"Hello! Earth to Tori! Did you find a date yet?" Lilla asked while waving her hand at Astoria."Huh? Oh. Why yes I did ladies." Astoria plopped a squat in the circle on the floor and accepted the joint from Pansy. She took an inhale and exhaled the smoke and said, "I am going with Harry Potter."Pansy nearly chocked on her own smoke."You are going with Potter? How did that happen? What happen to Diggory?""Yeah well, he is being a pussy and he already asked Daphne, before he and I were shagging so I had to make other arrangements.""I am sorry Tori. I knew how much you wanted to go with Ced." Fleur extended her hand and held Astoria's while giving her a warm comforting look.Astoria knew she could always go to Fleur for advice or comfort. She was her rock. Her voice of reason. Fleur was her first friend when she arrived at the academy."I am fine. I don't really care anyway. It is just a pathetic dance."Astoria did care. She was determined to have all eyes on her when she walked in those doors arm in arm with Potter.She wanted Cedric to see what he could have had for a date.

    1994The night of the ball had finally arrived. Astoria's stomach was in knots and her palms were beginning to slightly sweat.The Beauxbaton girls had decided they would all dress and primp together to help one another look as dazzling as possible.Pansy was helping Lilla with her hair while Astoria assisted Fleur with her smokey eye makeup.Astoria lightly tapped the brush onto Fleur's eyelid, but her hand began to shake."Tori are you alright? You seem a bit nervous." Fleur held Astoria's wrist and gave her a concerning look."I am fine, but I am nervous. This is all going to be so awkward. Cedric with Daphne and I am going with Harry. Harry is a wonderful guy and a great friend, but I am afraid it will give Cedric the wrong impression and- ""Fuck Diggory in my opinion, not literally" Lilla interrupted while flinging a makeup brush at Astoria's face.Astoria threw something back at Lilla and rolled her eyes, ignoring her statement."Sweetheart, I have just the thing for you to take the edge off. In my bag I have a flask of fire whiskey. Take a shot and your nerves will be at ease." Lilla said while giving her friend a warm smile that caused Astoria to crack one herself.Astoria pondered the idea of taking a few shots to calm her nerves. The feeling of hot firewhiskey enriching her veins was intriguing, but she denied the idea. She did not want to appear drunk at the dance with Harry. She did not want to give him the wrong idea that she was that kind of lady. Astoria was a Beauxbaton and she had to act like one."Lilla, will you please help me dress? My dress is rather difficult to put on by myself." Astoria said while walking over to the hangers.Lilla slid the dress up Astoria's body and hooked the clasps around her neck. Astoria spun around and put on her heels and accessories."You look stunning!" Fleur shouted."You are going to make him regret he ever promised to take Daphne instead of you." Lilla exclaimed loudly.Astoria wore a form fitted, back-less, red, diamond colored gown. The diamonds traced around her chest and leading up to her neckline. She was the epidemy of beauty.She looked like a Gryffindor goddess. She thought that if she was going to the ball with the Gryffindor champion then she might as well look the part.Harry met Astoria outside the temporary Beauxbaton dormitories, and his mouth hung open in amazement. His eyes scanned her body, and he showed a large smile.Astoria stood in front of her date and gave him a friendly hug greeting and took his arm to walk toward the great hall."You look beautiful, Tori. Thank you for accompanying me tonight."Astoria slightly blushed and held her hand around Harry's arm tighter."You don't look so bad yourself Potter. No, thank you for asking me, if you had not, I would not have the privilege of attending.""Diggory! Over her!""Miss. Delacour stand behind Diggory, if you please.""Krum you may lead in the front with Miss. Granger.""Pott-Potter! Where is Harry Potter?"Astoria heard McGonagall lining up the champions to enter the great hall and immediately her heart began to race, as they hastened over to Minerva."Phew there you are! Well, Miss. Greengrass is it? Do not you look rather splendid this evening. Please stand behind Miss. Delacour and wait for the doors to open, then you may enter the hall."Harry and Astoria both nodded and stood in line, almost impatiently to enter the hall.Fleur reached behind her and gave Astoria a tight squeeze before the doors opened.There she saw her. Her sister, Daphne, on Cedric's arm.Their eyes had not yet met but soon enough once they were all inside it would be impossible not to make eye contact.The doors began to open, and the champions entered the hall and there she saw all the students on either sides of the aisle way and she grabbed hold of Harry's arm so tight, that her gave her a warm grin and a squeeze on her hand.As Astoria was walking into the hall, she locked eyes with Pansy Parkinson. Pansy waved to Astoria and gave her a happy smile. Pansy had her arm on Malfoy.Astoria's eyes met with Malfoy's for a moment and she almost noticed the smirk he had on his face when she entered the hall.The champions were on the dancefloor and were about to begin their first dance, the waltz.After the first dance was over Harry walked over to his two friends and introduced Astoria to both."Tori these are my two best friends, Hermione and Ron.""Hi there. Blimey, Harry how did you get a Beauxbaton to accompany you tonight? Oh, no offense, Tori but I tried asking a few of the French ladies and they all denied me." Ron shrugged but gave Astoria a warm smile."Harry is a nice guy, and I knew I would be in good hands as my date this evening." Astoria's eye glanced over to Hermione's and she quickly realized who she was."Hermione, right? You are Hermione Grander? Viktor's date?" Astoria inquired lowly."I am. Yes. We met once before in the girl's lavatory some time ago. How are you doing these days? The head pain stopped completely?" Hermione leaned forward to try and touch Astoria's forehead, but she inched back."I am perfectly well. Thank you. Uhm- excuse me please, my friends are calling for me. I will catch up with you later, Harry."Astoria had no interest in meeting Harry's friends, so she decided to try and find either Lilla or Pansy. Fleur was too busy with her date, Roger, to talk with her.Astoria was making her way through the dance floor until someone caught her wrist.It was her sister, Daphne."Hey big sissy. How are we doing this evening?" Daphne said while giving her sister a sinister smirk.Daphne was obviously still irritated with the fact that Astoria and Cedric had been shagging the last few weeks."Hello Daphne. My evening is going quite well thank you. Harry accompanied me tonight, such a sweet guy he is." Astoria wanted to flee the scene and bury her face in her hands, but she had to be strong and act like the situation had no affect on her.Daphne got close to her sisters face and began to speak."You may have had Cedric these past few weeks, but he is with me. He is mine. Just tonight he told me how much he had missed me and loved me. He was using you Astoria. You gave him what he needed. Sex. You see, I was not ready to have sex yet, which put a strain on our relationship. So, when he found you, his urges were relinquished. Thank you big sissy for being his fuck toy so a real woman can take care of him." Daphne touched Astoria's chin with her thumb and walked off.Astoria did not know what to say.Her eyes began to pool with tears.Her chest began to heave.Cedric used her for sex.All their passionate kisses wasted.His love making to her was just a tool to relieve himself so he could be happy with Daphne.Astoria felt as if she was floating through the room.She felt disconnected from the crowd. She was frozen in her stance."Tori? Tori!"Astoria felt someone shaking her shoulders and she made out the person that was in front of her. It was Lilla, her best friend."Lill? I can't-I cannot- do this! I can't breathe Lill."Lilla wrapped her arms around her friend and guided her over to a nearby table.Astoria was heaving for air and her eyes were blank.No tears were streaming. She felt frozen without air in her lungs."Okay. Tell me what happened." Lilla was looking directly into Astoria's eyes."He used me Lill. He loves Daphne. He was fucking me to get it out of his system. He is happy with Daphne." Astoria buried her face in her friends' shoulder and let out gasps of breath."Okay-Okay. Breathe for me Tori. That damn bastard. I'll dismember him for this."Astoria felt another touch on her arm, it was Harry."Is she okay? What happened? She just left me a few minutes ago?" Harry inquired while a concerned facial expression.Harry was concerned for Astoria but was more confused than anything.Lilla shook her head and that signaled for him to leave the scene, but he hugged Astoria goodbye.Lilla lifted her friends' arms and began to guide her out the great hall doors.Astoria lifted her head and there he was. The brunette man that used her for sex and was in love with her sister."Ria I am so- ""You! Do not get to speak you fucking prick. How dare you use my best friend as your fuck toy! Back the fuck up Huffledick." Lilla pushed on Cedric's chest and he stepped away.Astoria met his eyes and ran up the stairs and through the hallway."Tori! Wait!" Lilla called out.Astoria ran and ran. She did not know where she was going but she just wanted to be alone.She found a staircase leading up to a look out tower in the castle.Tears were pouring out of her eyes and she was crying out for sweet release of the pain.She was a fool to think a man that wonderful would love her.She wanted some release.She wanted to be done with it all.She was tired of being hurt mentally and physically.Astoria climbed to the top of the staircase to find an astronomy tower.She walked over to the railing and looked out. She saw how beautiful the view was.Her face was smeared with mascara and red lipstick. She kicked off her heels and climbed to the other side of the rail.She could feel her pain being subsided.She began to sway over the edge until something grabbed her and yanked her back over the railing and onto the floor."What the fuck are you doing Greengrass!?"It was Draco Malfoy.Astoria banged her head off the ground and sat up distorted. She knew his voice. Why was he there? She was almost released."Are you fucking stupid enough to throw yourself off the astronomy tower?"Astoria sat up and put her hand in her hands."You should have let me die."Malfoy did not know what to say. He stared at her with confusion."I am tired of being used. I just wanted to be released from it all.""Merlin, Greengrass, what could have happened that bad that you decide to kill yourself?" Malfoy seemed genuinely interested in what had happened with Astoria that night."Cedric used me. He is in love with my sister. I am the sister nobody wants. I hate myself.""No you don't." Draco scoffed."Excuse me?""You do not fool me Greengrass. You love yourself too much. You know you are better than your sister." He said while looking down at Astoria."Do not presume to tell me what I am. You don't even know me Malfoy." Astoria shot up and began to strap her heels back on."Greengrass. You are too much of an open book. I can see everything you are just by regarding you. Cedric is a pussy anyway. Why are you fucking some middle class Hufflepuff? I would have figured your standards would be higher.""You know nothing of Cedric or I. We- "Malfoy moved closer to her and looked down into her eyes."You are nothing to him."Astoria's heartbeat was growing at a rapid pace. Why was Malfoy standing so close to her? Why was she nervous?Astoria thought he was going to kiss her just for a second."I am nothing to no one."Draco looked down at her and smirked."That's true."Draco looked into Astoria's eyes for a few seconds before placing his head around the back of her neck, arching her neck to look up at him."If I were you, I would not whore myself away to the first man that gives you attention. You are a Greengrass act like it."Draco aggressively let go of Astoria's neck making her lose her balance slightly.She felt a sense of lust in her abdomen.What did she feel?It was a rush of adrenaline.She looked at Draco Malfoy and felt nothing she never felt before.How dare he call her a whore.She was not a whore."You prick. Do not call me a whore. I will fuck whomever I please." Astoria walked over to the tall blond slowly."I am a Greengrass. I do as I please and I get what I want in the end. I wanted to fuck the life out of Cedric. I let him slip inside me and feel the desire I felt for him. I loved the way his hands felt around my body." Astoria was looking into Malfoy's eyes with lust and intent. Almost taunting him with her eyes.Draco towered over Astoria and looked down upon her. His hands began to trace up and down her arms. She sprouted goosebumps. Her breath began to grow deeper. His hands went to her back and began to trace her spine with his fingers. He was able to lead her against the wall and he leaned in on her.Astoria felt her heart beating out of her chest.Her eyes locked on his mouth. Draco's face was an inch away from hers."You see? That is how I know he couldn't give you all your desires. You are melting beneath my fingertips. I bet if I felt between your legs at this moment you would fall apart."Draco looked at Astoria with a smirk on his face and stood back up and walked over to the stairs."Have a pleasant night Greengrass."Astoria was speechless.She watched as the blond man walked back down the stairs and she was left leaning against the wall with her head spinning.Why would Draco Malfoy be at the astronomy tower?Why would he stop her from killing herself?She thought he disliked her.Astoria stood over the railing again, looking out onto Hogwarts grounds.She gripped the emerald necklace that was around her neck, hidden behind her dress. She never took off her emerald necklace. She held it tightly and began to whisper to herself."I do not understand. What am I supposed to do?"Tears trailed down her face and she was utterly confused.

    1999A few days had passed since Astoria's initial arrival to Malfoy Manor. A day prior she received an owl from one of her oldest friends, Lilla Dubois.Tori,Meet me in London tomorrow for a conversation.You know where to go.-Lill Lilla always kept her letters short for discretionary purposes. Astoria did indeed know where to meet her. When she was in school with Lilla, they sometimes would apparate to London and drink at a certain muggle pub. It was their way of escaping the stress of the world of magic.Astoria slipped on a black pencil skirt, black stockings, a cream-colored blouse, her nude strap heels and slapped on another layer of red lipstick.She was walking out the front door of the manor when Draco noticed her."Going out?" He shut the door in front of her and appeared in front of her face with an inquisitive expression."Indeed. Just for a couple of hours. Try not to miss me too much." Astoria shot Draco a wink and smacked his hand away from the doorknob, and apparated instantly.After a second she re-appeared behind a building in London. She realized she had not been to London in a few years and she missed it.Astoria loved the city life and the constant change lifestyle. She thrived off high-society life and showing off what she had. Astoria walked into the muggle pub and immediately spotted Lilla at a table in the corner."Why, Hello you little whore!" Lilla pulled Astoria into a quick embrace and gave her a warm smile."You look ravishing Mrs. Dolohov. How is Antonin these days? I have not seen him in ages."Lilla had married known death eater, Antonin Dolohov. One of the most ruthless death eaters there was. The only known witch and wizard to match his magic were Bellatrix Lestrange and Severus Snape."Oh, he is just dandy. You know Antonin. Now, doll, I called you here for a reason. I had to tell you this first before he got a hold of you. I have to give you this as a warning." Astoria's face instantly fell, and she felt a knot form in her stomach. Her palms began to clam."Lilla. What is going on?" Lilla lowered her eyes. She looked nervous."Astoria, The Dark Lord is demanding Draco re-join his place in court. He is unhappy with how Lucius is handling his work and the dark lord will be demanding Draco to return. I heard him say at the last meeting the Malfoy's are displeasing him greatly, and their only chance for redemption is if Draco finishes his father's work. He also- erm- mentioned you..." Lilla stopped herself and began to fidget with the glass she had in front of her.Astoria extended her hand and placed it on Lilla's and gave her a warm smile."What about me? What will he have me do now? I am already to marry Draco, what else could he possibly wish of me?" Astoria inquired lowly.Lilla leaned forward, still holding Astoria's hand."The Dark Lord demands that you stand by his side if Draco fails to finish his fathers work. He treasures you, Astoria. The only reason he is tasking you with marrying into the Malfoy family is so you will always have a place in court with him. You know a woman cannot hold her own status in the Dark Lord's court unless she is married to one of his loyal followers."Lilla murmured.Astoria took a short breath and began to organize her thoughts. Most important to less important."Lilla, what is Lucius' work that the dark lord assigned him?" Astoria spat."Lucius is tasked with rounding up the mudbloods and turning them over for experimental trial." Lilla leaned in and whispered.Astoria's eyes grew wide. She knew Draco would not be able to do such a thing. Draco had his feelings about blood purity but to harm Granger is something he would not expect."Experimental trial?" Astoria asked."Indeed. The council is working on developing a curse that sucks out all magical ability from a witch or wizard. He needs test subjects. You know the Dark Lord believes in a pure blood line generation of witches and wizards." Lilla whispered.So many thoughts were going through Astoria's mind. Voldemort wanted Astoria by his side if or when he assassinated Draco Malfoy. She would have to stand by her ruler, her lord, and her owner."Astoria, I am telling you this as your friend. If you have any love left for Draco you will obliviate any feelings he has for that mudblood, Granger. You are in no condition to know the truth-" Lilla quickly covered her mouth and turned her head. Astoria knew she said something she should not have.What did Astoria not understand? She felt like putting a puzzle together but Lilla was stashing pieces from her reach.Astoria eyes began to pool because she realized she still had love for him. The boy who never has a choice. The boy who manages to have everything he loved ripped away from him."I can't do it. I cannot do that to him. Thank you for the conversation, Lilla. I will be in touch. I am sure the Dark Lord will summon me when he needs an audience." Astoria said as she gathered her purse.Astoria hugged her best friend goodbye and as she retreated from the pub her chest began to heave. She was not ready to return to the manor. She could not look at the man she still loved in his eyes and pretend to despise him.Astoria knew he despised her, to the core, but as much as he did not have a choice in his life neither did, she. Draco never understood the choice she made for herself the night of the battle. Her head always felt foggy during those days of her life.As Astoria was walking through the streets of London, she saw a familiar face across the way. Standing in front of a local tea shop there stood a red-headed man, George Weasley.Astoria pondered if she should approach him. She had not seen him since Hogwarts, but he might recognize her if she approached him."What a strange running into you in London, Mr. Weasley." Astoria spat."Astoria..?" George squinted his eyes and looked Astoria up and down. When he realized who she was she noticed him take a few paces back. Astoria tucked a piece of hair behind her ear and glanced down at her shoes."The one and only.." Astoria smirked."Blimey..." George said in shock as he started to step back.Ever since the Battle of Hogwarts, Astoria rarely showed her face in public in the wizarding community. So many witches and wizards were still upset when Light lost the war.The two stood there in silence for about thirty seconds, until another familiar face appeared in front of her. A frizzed brown-haired girl with a gentle smile walked up to Ron and grabbed his arm."Come George, I got the Essence of Dittany. We mustn't be late...Uhm... who is thi-Oh my- " Hermione approached rapidly and quickly realized who stood before her.Astoria looked up and saw Hermione Granger.The girl who Draco, supposedly was still in love with."My, my, Granger, how are we these days?" Astoria spat.Hermione looked ready to grab her wand and shoot a hex at Astoria, but Hermione kept her face stern but her guard up."Erm— uhm. Fine. How-how are you?" Hermione said lowly trying to break eye contact but keeping close to George."Things are bloody brilliant these days. I am to be married actually within the year." Astoria shot Granger a look that could kill.Astoria memories of Hermione were fuzzy, but all she knew was she could feel the hatred for her.However, for some reason she had a soft spot for the mudblood. She knew she was important to Draco."Yes, I hear you are to be married. Congratulations. I am sure Draco is thrilled.." Hermione looked sick to her stomach while saying that and George instantly wrapped his arm around Hermione in comfort."Granger, watch your back. Do not trust anyone, including me. There is a storm coming and people who are not behind it will get demolished by it. For your own sake, leave him be." Astoria whispered to Hermione.Hermione was silent for a second. She was soaking up the information Astoria was providing.If Hermione was as smart as she always led on to be, she would heed Astoria's warning. She did not know it at the time, but she just gave her a hint that another battle is on the horizon and her kind are not safe.Astoria slipped on her sunglasses and walked past the couple, she walked behind a building and instantly appeared in front of the manor.
  
    Chapter Text
    1995It had been a few months since the night of the Yule Ball. Astoria spent most of her days perfecting her legilimency and decided to start painting again.She had a few encounters with her sister Daphne over the past months."I am quite excited for this year to conclude, because then your ratty ass will return to France and you will finally leave Cedric and I alone." Daphne said in her sisters face with the snare of a tiger."Daphne. Do not think you are anymore better than I. Just remember every time Cedric touches you, it's my body he is thinking about." Astoria said in her sister's face.Astoria and her sister have not spoken much since. She knew Daphne resented her for shagging Cedric while they were "on a break." Astoria did not even know what a relationship break was.She figured you are either together or you are not.It was different relationship culture in France. When a man and woman started to shag up together, they stayed together out of respect. People did not "sleep around" while being committed to another.Astoria needed to put Cedric to the back of her mind.She has had a few encounters with Cedric over the past few months, but they were not as pleasant as her encounters with Daphne."Ria. I am sorry. Do not listen to what Daphne says. I never used you. I cared so much for you." Cedric said as he tugged on Astoria's arm as she was attempting to avoid his presence.Astoria turned around to face the man that betrayed her most."Cedric. I hope you are happy with your decision in the Greengrass girls. You did have the one who was willing to show you the kind of love you never dreamed of. You threw it away for my twit of a sister." Astoria leaned in closer to Cedric and whispered into his ear. "When you make love to my sister. Just remember it's my face you once saw beneath you." Astoria raised her eyebrows at him and walked away.She has not had an encounter with the brunette since then.Astoria was conflicted if she wanted to go back to France to finish off her education at Beauxbaton Academy.She knew that was the best option for her. Considering all her friends would be going back and the one family member she had at Hogwarts would thrive from seeing her being thrown off the astronomy tower.Something inside of Astoria was telling her to say in England. To study at Hogwarts.She decided to consult with her most knowledgeable and reasonable friend, Fleur Delacour.Astoria was laying on her back on her bed while just staring at her ceiling, hoping to fall asleep, but she knew she wanted to have this conversation with Fleur.Fleur was prepping her strategies for the last task of the Triwizard Tournament. The last task took place in the black lake. The champions had to rescues their beloved friends or lovers. Cedric was tasked with rescuing Daphne, Viktor was tasked with rescuing Granger, Harry had to save Ronald Weasley and Fleur had to save her little sister. Cedric came in first place and Daphne rewarded him with a passionate kiss while everyone cheered. Astoria felt like jumping into the black lake and letting the merpeople tear her to shreds."Fleur." Astoria murmured."Hmm?" Fleur hummed warmly."Can I discuss a matter with you without judgement?" She said lowly.Fleur quickly sat up on her bed and looked over at Astoria."Of course, you can. I would never judge you. What is on your mind?""Should I return to Beauxbaton or should I remain here, at Hogwarts?" Astoria inquired.There was silence for a minute or two. Fleur looked dumbfounded. Astoria always thought she would finish off her schooling in France. Then travel around the world with her friends in search of adventure, but something was pulling Astoria towards England. She missed the English culture and the new friends she made at Hogwarts were weighing heavy on her heart.Pansy Parkinson became one of Astoria's close friends. They shared smoke breaks, secrets, gossip, and the occasional flask swig of fire whiskey. Pansy was someone Astoria could go to for advice about Hogwarts. She was her partner in divination. Their bond became almost inseparable.Then there was Lilla. Lilla was special to Astoria and vice versa. The girls have been in much mischief together in France and drove Madame Maxime bonkers on some occasions. They shared deep conversations about life, hopes and dreams and their unpleasant family lives. Astoria did not want to leave Lilla behind.Fleur would be graduating this year from the academy. If Astoria went back to France Fleur would no longer be her roommate. She has been sleeping next to Fleur for years and whenever she was not there it did not feel like home. Fleur was Astoria's voice of reason and compassion. Fleur really was the mother of the friend group. She kept her friends in line when she could."Astoria. I think you will thrive in whatever school you decide to attend. You need to make this decision on what your mind is telling you. Are you going to be happy in a new environment? I know it is not new now, but you have been under the impression this is all temporary just for the year, but now, if you decide to say, this is it, this will be your life for the next few years."Astoria rolled to her side to face her friend and a tear rolled down her cheek. She quickly got up and went over to Fleur and she embraced her tightly. Fleur began to rub her back and scratch her head in comfort."Come now. We must get some sleep. The final task is tomorrow, and I need rest!" Fleur shot Astoria a smile and shooed her over to her own bed.It was the day of the final task of the Triwizard tournament. Everyone was on the edge of their seat for the game to begin and for the winner to be revealed.Astoria, Lilla, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco all piled into the bleachers to see the champions set off into the maze. Astoria's eyes met with Cedric's before he went in. He looked frightened, more than she has ever seen him. She could not help herself, but she stared at him and got inside his head.Be brave. Think wisely. Help your teammates, and win.
Cedric's head shot up and looked directly at Astoria. He gave her a short nod along with a smile.The canon sounded and the champions walked into the maze.For a minute, a tear rolled down Astoria's cheek. She knew this was the most difficult task and she was worried for Cedric and Fleur.After a couple of hours Astoria suddenly felt a blinding pain in her head. She grabbed onto Pansy's arm as she started to collapse."Pansy! It hurts! Pans-"Astoria shouted.Lilla ran to her friends' side and held her hand."Lilla! Merlin, I cannot fathom a thought. My mind is splitting!" Astoria's eyes went dark as she felt someone lift her and apparate her."Mr. Malfoy? What is going on? Who is she? What is wrong with her?"Astoria's eyes were closed but she could still hear the people around her.She felt like her mind had been turned to mush."Madame Pomfrey. I am not sure. She collapsed and complained of agonizing head pain. I did not know what to do so I brought her here."Astoria felt her body be laid on a bed until she heard someone else running into the infirmary."Madame Pomfrey! We need you at the maze! A boy has been injured!""Mr. Malfoy stay with her. She seems fine right now. I must tend to the injured boy."Astoria felt herself drift and pass out.Astoria felt her hand being held by someone she knew.She opened her eyes, and it was Lilla. Lilla was sitting on her head stroking her hand and Fleur was sitting in a chair next to her."Hey" Astoria coughed out. When she opened her eyes, she immediately felt dizzy."Oh Tori!" Lilla quickly embraced Astoria."We thought something horrible happened to you! You were not there when I was pulled from the maze!" Fleur held Astoria's hand."Are you okay Fleur?""Yes, yes I am fine. Just got caught up in some vines." Fleur lowered her head and began to sniffle.Lilla turned her head and Astoria noticed the tears rolling down her cheek."Guys I am fine. Please do not cry. I just suffered from a migraine attack; I know it. I got this before. Don't cry!"Both girls shook their heads and looked at one another."Fleur, tell her I cannot." Lilla rose from the bed and sat in the chair next to her.Fleur rose and took Astoria's hand."Astoria." Fleur took another deep breath, holding back more tears."Cedric is dead."Astoria's eyes jolted open in fear, sadness, astonishment, and pain.Her chest began to heave. Her pulse began to rise along with her heartbeat. She released a painful, loud scream.Both her friends embraced her tightly.All their memories began to flood her head.The first time they met.Cedric caught the eyes of Astoria burning through him as he approached her.
"I've never seen you here before. You must be one of those Bauxbaton Girls."
"Yes, I am. My name is Astoria.""Alright, well, Ria, how about we grab another drink and go for a walk?""Kiss me Astoria.""Make love to me Astoria."She felt as if she were in a dream. She wanted to wake up and not have to feel all this heartbreak. She was never going to be able to see her brunette champion again.Amid all the memories flooding back to her, her mind went to her sister.Daphne.Cedric was dead. The man her sister loved was dead."Oh, my merlin. Daphne. Where is Daphne! Someone find me my sister I need to see her!" Astoria began thrashing out while hysterically crying into Lilla's shoulder."We will find Daphne. Please Astoria breathe. Breathe in and out for me for a count of ten." Lilla said."I do not need to fucking breathe. I need to find my sister and check on her. Even though she is a cunt she is my blood!" Astoria threw the covers off herself and put on her blue Beauxbaton uniform and ran out of the infirmary.Astoria checked everywhere for Daphne. The great hall, the astronomy tower, the Ravenclaw common room area, until finally, she saw her, on the steps leading out to one of the many exits of the castle.The sisters made eye contact with one another and she saw her sister break down before her.Astoria ran over to Daphne and closed her with a tight embrace and Daphne cried into her sister chest. Astoria could feel her sisters heart breaking beneath her, and her breathing was unsteady. She was afraid her sister was breathing too fast."Daphne. I am so sorry. I am so sorry." Astoria held her sister in her arms and comforted her."I still hate you, but oh my merlin, Astoria he is GONE." Daphne wailed into her sister's chest and let out every emotion she was feeling.Astoria decided at that moment, her sister needed her.Astoria would stay at Hogwarts."Daphne. I have something to tell you.""Oh no. Now what. Please do not make me hurt more, Astoria." Daphne cried out.Astoria held her sisters head in her hands."I have decided I will be staying at Hogwarts instead of going back to France. I need you and you need me. I would like to rekindle our relationship."Daphne was silent for a minute, studying her sisters face, she knew she was being sincere.Daphne took a deep breath and muttered the word "okay" and laid her head back on Astoria's lap.

    1995A Beaxubaton uniform. A Hogwarts sweatshirt. A pair of blue Mary-jane heels. All items being tightly packed in the trunk marked "A. Greengrass."Astoria's eyes scanned her dormitory. She ran her fingers along the dresser, and she knew this would be the last moment in her dorm with Fleur.Fleur had been her roommate for almost four years and now they were going their separate ways.Fleur has concluded her education and was planning on traveling to Romania to study dragons. The first task of the Triwizard tournament sparked a hidden interest for the magical creatures, that she wanted to study them up close and personal.Astoria was not going to return to France to finish her education at Beauxbaton Academy, instead she was going to become a true Hogwarts student.She had not told her parents yet of her decision, but she knew her mother was not going to take it lightly. Eloise Greengrass had been a cultured French woman and she also attended Beauxbaton. Her hope would be that one of her daughters would follow in her footsteps and carry on the Beauxbaton tradition. Astoria almost did, she was hoping that would be enough for her mother.Something in Hogwarts was pulling Astoria. She felt more at home there than anywhere else.Astoria and Fleur made their way to the train platform. Fleur would be traveling back to France to say farewell to her family before her departure to Romania, so she was taking the carriage back to Beauxbaton.Astoria decided it was best to travel the Hogwarts Express home with Daphne so she could meet her parents at the train station."You sure you will be alright here next term without me?" Fleur asked Astoria while putting her arm around her."Yes, Fleur. Trust me I will be fine. Even though this year has been, trying, I am looking forward to what the next term has in store. Now that Daphne does not loathe me anymore, we can start to build back our friendship."Astoria and Fleur arrived at the platform to find Lilla, Pansy, Blaise and Draco already to board the train.Lilla was going to be spending the summer with Astoria and Daphne in England. Lilla's homelife was not a splendid one so whenever she had the offer to spend her summer vacation elsewhere, she leaped at the opportunity."Tori! Holy shit I am glad you are doing better. You gave us such a freight at the last game. I thought you were having a seizure!" Pansy quickly ran to her friend and pulled her into a tight hug."Yeah, well, thank goodness it was just a migraine attack. I get those from time to time and they can be quite brutal."Astoria has not spoken to Draco about when he apparated her to the infirmary the day she nearly passed out.She wondered why he cared so much for her health and well-being?Was he just being a gentleman?To care for the woman that is in distress.She figured this was not the time to discuss such matters.Hagrid called for all the students to board the train.Astoria pulled Fleur in for a tight hug and the girls stayed like that for a few minutes. A few tears spilled from both Astoria's and Fleur's eyes. They shared a special bond of friendship that would never be severed."You take care of yourself. You remember if you ever need me I am an owl away. I will miss you terribly, Tori.""You also be careful around those dragons. I hear that horntail is a beast not to be messed up. Do not go burning your hair off by getting too close."Astoria boarded the train with the group and gave one last wave goodbye to Fleur.She was going to miss her more than she realized.The group found an empty compartment.Astoria figured this would be a good time as any to spring some news on her friends."So., I have decided." Astoria paused for a minute to gather everyone's attention. "I will be returning to Hogwarts for the Fall semester."Pansy's eyes lit up and she reached across the compartment and hugged Astoria."Oh my god this is fantastic! I cannot wait to see what house you get sorted into. If you get into Slytherin then we can be roommates! I dread the one I have now so that would be spectacular!"Astoria glanced over at Lilla who was conflicted."I'm happy for you. But I am pissed you are leaving me, bitch." Lilla said with a smile while embracing Astoria lightly."Oh great. Now we'll have another dimwitted Greengrass roaming the grounds of that pathetic school."Astoria shot Malfoy a look of disgust."Don't worry Malfoy. I am sure you will find things that will occupy your mind when you're not thinking about me." Astoria spat.Pansy began laughing along with Blaise.Lilla gave Astoria a look of being confused.Astoria shot Malfoy a look of intent. She gave him what he always gave her, a eyebrow quirk and a tight lipped smirk.Summer break ended as quickly as it arrived.Astoria's mum was not too thrilled with her decision to go to Hogwarts full time, but she respected her choices.Amid it all Lilla had also decided to transfer from France to England. She said she had been tired of the French culture and was ready to experience some high society English men at Hogwarts.Even though most of the men at Hogwarts acted like boys.Astoria hopped off the train with Daphne, and she was nervous.More nervous than she was a year ago when she arrived with the Beaxubaton's. She was not a Beauxbaton anymore. Right now she did not know where she belonged because she needed to be sorted.Daphne gave her sisters hand a squeeze and they made their way into the great hall."Welcome everyone to another year at Hogwarts! To start off the sorting ceremony we will sort the older students that are transfers!"McGonagall was standing with a scroll next to a dingy stool.Astoria did not want to be sorted in front of the entire school.Where would she be sorted?Gryffindor? Astoria was brave and was willing to do anything for the people she loved.Ravenclaw? She was a smart and rational witch. The best at legilimency for her age. She valued books and knowledge.Hufflepuff? She was also kind to the people who were kind to her. She had a soft spot in her heart for the people who did right by her.Slytherin? Astoria was ambitious and cunning. She knew what she wanted, and she did not care who was in her way.Astoria went over all the house qualities in her head and realized she could be placed anywhere."Astoria Greengrass!" McGonagall announced.Astoria took a deep breath, climbed the stairs and sat upon the stool.She felt the hat on her head, and it began to speak."Hmm interesting. Very determined witch we have here. You have the strength of ten witches in your heart and the knowledge of twenty inside your head. Now where to put you, child?"Astoria's mind was scrambling. She just wanted to belong, she just wanted a home and the hat said-"Slytherin!"Astoria's eyes darted to the Slytherin table. All the students were cheering for her.Pansy immediately guided her over and hugged her tightly."Thank GOD. Now we're roommates!" Pansy exclaimed.Astoria looked around the table until she locked eyes with Malfoy.His stare.His eyes.She missed his eyes.She had to get him out of her mind.He hated her.She disliked him back."Pans. I need a smoke."Pansy nodded in agreement.The girls went outside and lit up a cigarette."Where is your friend Lilla? I thought she was returning with you?"Astoria took the cigarette out of her lips and exhaled."She went home to France to visit with her family. She is joining us next week. I cannot wait for her to get here. I am astounded she decided to leave Beauxbaton, but I am glad she did. Even though I love you Pans it's nice to have someone from France be here with me."Pansy took the cigarette from Astoria and took a drag."Tori. I need your opinion on something.""Anything."Pansy paused for a few minutes, she seemed to try to be gathering her words."I-do-do-you think Draco has feelings for me?"Astoria eyes shot up and looked at her friend."Oh-Pansy I do not know. You know him way better than I do. Him and I have barely spoken."It was true. Astoria and Draco had barely shared any moments together. The only real conversation they had was the night of the Yule Ball at the astronomy tower.A night that Astoria for some reason kept replaying her head."I like him a lot. Like deeply. I think I am bonkers. He would never like me like that. I mean every so often we have sex but the last few times it has happened for me it felt different. Like he was actually noticing me while he was fucking me."Astoria was beginning to grow uncomfortable with this conversation, but she wanted to be there for her friend.Astoria had not given much thought to what Draco Malfoy might be like in bed.Is he gentle?Is he rough?Did he enjoy foreplay?Some questions that would sometimes arise when the thoughts came to Astoria."Pansy. My best advice for you would be to act on anything you feel. I mean it may not always turn out the way you please. I mean, look at my track record. I fell for my sister's love, and shagged him, several times. And then he died- "Astoria paused and Pansy extended her hand and laid it on the top of Astoria's."I am here for you if you need to talk.""No, Pansy it is fine. Daphne and I spent so much time talking, crying it out over the summer. Cedric is behind me. May he fly high." Astoria said with a hint of sarcasm and flicked her cigarette off the ledge."Come on blondie. Let us head to bed. Classes start in the morning."Astoria nodded and followed her friend to the Slytherin dorms.She realized she would now be able to enter the common room without the need of another Slytherin student.Astoria was a Slytherin student.She approached the painting and muttered the words pureblood cautiously.The girls entered the room to find Blaise and Malfoy sitting upon the leather couches passing back and forth a bottle of fire whiskey."Ahh well if it isn't my two favorites." Blaise snorted."Have a drink with us Parkinson." Malfoy signaled for Pansy to join him on the couch. "You too Greengrass. You're one of us now. That means you join in group drinking sessions."Astoria nodded and sat with Pansy across from the boys.The boys seemed to be a little more on the tipsy side.Astoria could feel Malfoy's eyes burning through her, and it was not the fire whiskey she was feeling.Astoria looked up and met his eyes locked on hers.He took a swig of the bottle and smirked at her with intent.
  
    Chapter Text
    1995Astoria sat on the leather couch and took a cigarette out from her purse. She put the cigarette between her lips and lit it. She inhaled deeply and exhaled and passed the cigarette to Pansy."I see we have a bad habit." Draco spat."It's the only thing that keeps me calm when I am around you. You tend to make my blood boil." Astoria said back.Astoria took the fire whiskey bottle and took a large slug of it. "Let us play a game. We can play one of those fun muggle drinking games." Pansy exclaimed.Draco and Blaise looked at each other and rolled their eyes in annoyance.Astoria was not too experienced with muggle games, but she did enjoy anything that had to do with alcohol. Once the sweet burning sensation touched her throat, she developed liquid courage and was not afraid to say or do anything."Oh—Don't be a couple of perdants and play whatever game my lovely friend wants to play." Astoria flicked her wand and conjured up a bottle of wizarding vodka.Wizard made vodka was made slightly different than muggle vodka. Wizarding vodka enhanced mood, magical mischief, left no hangover effects and had no burning sensation when tasted alone. Wizard vodka was Astoria's liquor of choice and she tended to keep a secret bottle stashed in her pockets whenever she needed some liquid courage."Oh -la -la- ma che'rie. Since when do we speak French?" Pansy asked while nudging Astoria.Astoria was a little more than tipsy at this point. She felt her eyes become hazy and she was having trouble keeping balance, and she was sitting..."Pan-Pansy Parker-Parkinson. I studied in France. Wee Wee. You think I would not speak French? Idiote." Astoria laughed into her hands.When Astoria was beyond intoxication her French speaking became more prominent. She did not enjoy speaking French particularly, since she was a native English speaker, but since most of her classmates spoke French it was only natural for her to learn the native language."Alright. Now we are going to play this very interesting muggle game I discovered over the summer. It is called "never have I ever." Pansy said while taking a slug of fire whisky."That sounds positively tosh. Why would we play a muggle game when we could play Wizards Toss?" Draco tossed his hands in the air and received the bottle of fire whiskey from Blaise."Let us play for a while Malfoy. It may be a jolly good time." Blaise said."Thank you Blaisey boy. Now. I will start." Puff. Pansy turned facing everyone. "Now— how this works is—is if you have done something you take a drink." Pansy demonstrated while throwing back an empty bottle of whisky."Never have I ever shagged someone in the prefect's bathroom on the third floor!" Blaise exclaimed loudly while making direct eye-contact with Astoria.Astoria's eye widened. Everyone knew she had shagged Cedric in that very tub. Bubbles surrounding them, and she could feel his touch on her still. The Hufflepuff's touch was sensational, but it was always too... soft for her liking.Astoria scanned the room and noticed Blaise had taken a drink and she let out an exhale, gave a shy smile and took a slug."Tori you whore!!" Pansy yelled while nudging her friend."It was quite aaaa——arousing experience..." Astoria slurred while almost losing her balance (while sitting)."I am not surprised. Given who you are." Malfoy sneered while taking a swig of his fire whisky bottle."—And what the hell is that supposed to mean, Malfoy? Jealous it was not you?" Astoria spat while batting her eyes.Pansy's eyes widened along with Blaise's. Students had the look of shock on their face."Greengrass, I would not touch your pathetic body even if I was paid to do so. You whore yourself to any ma- "Malfoy was cut off by the sudden crash of a bottle being thrown at his head. Astoria was standing over him fuming. How dare he talk to her like that."You fucking bitch-" Malfoy spat while standing abruptly. Blaise held back Malfoy from what it looks like a punch to Astoria's face."Merlin, Astoria are you mental? Draco is DRUNK! I am sure he did not mean it!" Pansy said while attempting to clean off Draco's shoulders from the glass."Game over. Parkinson, Zabini, get out. Greengrass and I need to have a discussion. Alone." Malfoy spat out.Pansy looked hesitant to leave her friend with a man who almost punched her, but she knew not to mess with Malfoy when he was in agitated state. Zabini tugged on Pansy's arm and they made their way up the stairs to their dorm rooms.Astoria stood like a statue. She could not believe what she did. He deserved it. Malfoy does not get to call a woman a whore and get away with it.The pale blond walked over to the fireplace and placed both his hands on the mantle and took deep breath. After a few minutes of silence Astoria decided to light a cigarette. What else was she supposed to do? The young (intoxicated) witch lit the cigarette between her lips and took a deep inhale and exhale. Puff."Fucking, Merlin." Malfoy made his way over to Astoria and ripped the cigarette from her lips and threw it into the fire."What the hell Malf- ""Quit that shit. It's classless."Astoria threw her arms in the air and found herself completely dumbfounded. Why would he care about if she were acting classy or trashy? This man just called her a whore for shagging in the prefect bathroom and now he was offended by her smoking in front of him again?"Sit." Malfoy demanded."I am not you bitch. Do not presume to tell me what to do."Malfoy looked deep into her eyes and was an inch from her face."Greengrass, I am up to my neck in irritation with you right now. Now sit your entitled arse on that couch before I make you." He seethed through his teeth.Something in her made her sit. Why would she obey him? She just told him she was not his dog and now she was listening to him. God damn wizarding vodka. Malfoy made his way back over to the fireplace and Astoria watched him with intent."If you want an apology you will not get one. You should have gotten worse for saying such things to me."Malfoy was silent. He took another swig of his fire whisky that sat on the coffee table. Then proceeded to take a seat on the table to face her. Malfoy's gaze burned through her. This man was impossibly gorgeous, but all the more, irritatingly irrational."I will not be apologizing neither. I meant what I said. Both times."Astoria gave him a confused look and furrowed her brows. "Both times?"Malfoy took the tip of his finger and tipped her chin up. "You are a whore. You enjoy being touched. You enjoy the sensation of danger and the arousal of force." Draco was an inch from her face, she could smell the whisky off his breath. "That limp dick Diggory was probably afraid to touch you."Astoria got in Malfoy's face. "Keep Cedric's name out of your damned mouth, Malfoy. You aren't even half the man he was."Malfoy lunged forward and gripped Astoria by the throat."You would be wise to watch your tone Greengrass. You have no idea who you're messing with." Astoria smirked at him."You think I am scared of a spoiled rich boy with daddy issues?"His squeeze got tighter."I know a lot more than you think. You seem to forget that my family is also part of the sacred twenty-eight pureblood families. I am just as good as you are, and maybe better." She croaked out.Malfoy got an inch from Astoria face and had the look of anger in his face, still holding her neck in place."You think you're better than I am Greengrass?""I've felt love. I know what it's like to be in love."Draco let go of his grip and became to laugh in sarcastic amusement."And what could possibly be amusing?"Draco quirked an eyebrow and looked at Astoria."You think that was love Greengrass? You think you loved Diggory? I did not know love meant fucking behind your sisters back or having him leave you for Daphne or- ""Shut it! Espèce de salaud au cœur froid!" Astoria began to tear. She was furious.Malfoy inched over to her again and backed Astoria into a wall. Both his arms were on either side of her, closing her in.Their eyes were locked.Her eyes were pooled with tears. Draco smirks were fueled by hate. He enjoyed making her cry and having her break down in his midst. Astoria opened her mouth and let out a light exhale and began to stare at Malfoy's mouth."If I would not know any better Malfoy. I would say you are trying to snog me." Astoria spat."I do not kiss sluts. However, —" Malfoy grabbed Astoria by the arms and had her stand. "—I could make an exception."Malfoy began to lean, and Astoria also leaned in.Just before their lips touched, she stepped on his toe and smacked his left cheek."You keep Cedric's name out of your mouth. I do not know what Pansy fancies about you, but you are nothing but a seething bastard who enjoys breaking down women." Astoria hovered over him. "I will not be tormented or sucked into your mind games. No matter how many times you entrap me against a wall."Malfoy stood in front of the fire in disbelief and a disgusted look upon his face."Pleasant dreams, whore.""Goodnight, ferret boy." Astoria gave him a wink and strutted up the stairs.Before she went into the dorms she slid against the wall. What did she feel? Triumph? Sadness? Grief over Cedric? Anger? Arousal? Lust? Lust? Fucking Merlin.Astoria shook her head in disbelief that she would be mentally disfigured if she were becoming aroused by such a monstrous encounter. Astoria concluded that she was having a mental breakdown and she desperately needed Lilla. She would arrive next week. She had to make it week.

    1995A few days had passed. Astoria felt herself drawing more and more into herself. She was becoming introverted. She began questioning her decision to transfer to Hogwarts.Why did she want to go through such a culture shock?Adventure?Or was she becoming bored with the person she was turning into in France.She figured if she did not return to France then the girl who had no chance at a soaring future would die.Astoria stuck close to Pansy. She was using her as her own protective shield. Mentally, if Malfoy would approach and call her a whore again, she might break down.She was strong willed, but everyone has a boiling point.Since Astoria was sorted into Slytherin house she did not see much of Daphne, since she was in Ravenclaw. She could not even consult her sister on the matter.Astoria did not want a pity party. She could fix this on her own.The migraines were becoming more prominent. More painful. Astoria was sneaking cranial pain relief potions from Professor Snape's stores. She needed something to take the edge off.Before she stepped out the lavatory stall, she downed the potion and met Pansy outside for a smoke.The girls lit up both their cigarettes, took deep inhales and exhales.They enjoyed sitting on the ledge of the quad area and enjoying the crisp air.It would start to get cold soon, so Astoria soaked in all the vitamin D from the sun onto her skin."You look like hell, doll." Pansy regarded."Gee. Thanks. Like I did not know already." Astoria rolled her eyes and continued taking hits of her cigarette."I'm just saying I am worried for you. You are starting to become quite pale Astoria. You barely eat when we are at meals. What is going on with you? This is not like yo- ""Then what am I like! Do you know! I certainly do not anymore. Oh. Wait I do know. I am the whore of Slytherin." Astoria spat.Pansy let out a playful chuckle. "No, that is me, darling.""This is not funny Pansy. Malfoy said- ""Poppycock what Malfoy says. You are NO whore, Astoria. You are a Greengrass.""That's what I am always told. You're a Greengrass, act as so." Astoria rolled her eyes and wrapped her arms around her knees.  "I do not understand how you can fancy such a spoiled jerk of a rich boy." Astoria spat."So, this is about Draco?" Pansy said surprised."Draco and I have been friends since our first year. We have a bond. He was also my first and I regard him differently. I have always fancied him. I just told you that so I could get some advice from someone who did not know us as a couple." Pansy admitted."You guys are a couple? Since when?""Well." Pansy hesitated. "I would like for us to be a couple since we have spent many shagged-up nights together. I fear he does not see me that way or care for me.""Seems as if Malfoy does not have the ability to love or care for anyone but himself. His ego is as tall as the astronomy tower." Astoria said while flipping her hair to the side.Both girls laughed and Astoria patted Pansy on the shoulder.At dinner, the next night the girls decided to join Zabini and Malfoy at the Slytherin table. Astoria had to take a few hits of a calming cigarette before she could enter the snake pit.As Astoria was taking a spoonful of rice the boys joined them for dinner."Ahhh- evening Parkinson. Greengrass." Malfoy sent Astoria a look that could slice through her with a knife. Astoria sent him a look with her eyes, and he broke the contact.The three made mindless conversation about classes, new students, about the ministry crumbling over the siting of "he who must not be named.""I think I am going to retire for the night. Pleasant evening." Astoria excused herself and walked out of the great hall.She went outside and it was a warm night, she instantly felt the need to put all her emotions into a painting.She decided to find a nice spot and put all of what she was feeling on the canvas.She flicked her wand and conjured up an artists' stand, following a stool and her paint supplies.Astoria sat upon the stool and reached into her enchanted bag for her cassette player. She always felt most inspired when she could hear the song Silver Springs by Stevie Nicks.Fleetwood Mac was her favorite band and they originated from the United Kingdom.You could be my silver spring. Blue, green, colors flashing, I would be your only dream.Don't say that she's pretty. Did she say that she loved you? Baby, I do not wanna' know."The song filled her ears and her she began to feel the stroke of her brush sliding on the canvas.A few hours passed and she had a basis of the painting complete.The painting was of a girl looking onto the world. She saw the moon creeping out between the clouds and she could feel her life waiting for her.The painting consisted of blue, grey, white, and black.Astoria regarded her painting while listening to the song Kind of a Woman by Stevie NicksAstoria regarded her painting while listening to the song Kind of a Woman by Stevie Nicks.She sat in silence for a few moments.Then she felt the blinding pain in her skull. She began to see spots.Astoria... Astoria...She heard a voice in her head. It was dark and she could feel the voice creeping through her skin.Astoria fell off the stool, kicking over the paint, making it fall to the ground.She held her hands between her head.She was screaming in pain for it felt like a hunter's knife was carving through her skull.My Astoria..."LEAVE MY HEAD!" She shouted.She heard something running over to her.Or someone.She was on the ground looking up at the moon. A hooded figure appeared before her dressed in black."Merlin! Greengrass? What the devil is wrong!" It was Malfoy.The head pain suddenly vanished.She gripped her necklace and looked up regarding the blond who stood before her."What the hell are you doing out here, Malfoy?" Astoria sat back on her stool and began packing up her paints and supplies."What? Am I not allowed to take a leisurely stroll on a night as fine as this one?" Malfoy looked intently down at Astoria. Then he noticed her painting."I see we have a hidden talent for the arts." Malfoy calmy said."Not hidden. Just not used as often as I like."Was he trying to have a conversation? Why now?Three days ago, he called her a whore and now he was trying to make small talk?"Well. I am going to retire for the night." Astoria said lowly while attempting to gather her art supplies.Malfoy grabbed her wrist and made her meet his eyes."Greengrass." Draco spat."What is it Malfoy? More name calling? Or would you like to slap me this time? I'd call it fair since I smashed your head with a glass bottle." Astoria spat.Astoria's breathing became heavier. She just wanted to go to sleep and her this night."Don't-Don't get addicted to those cranial relief potions." Draco murmured while gazing into her brown eyes.Astoria eyes widened and she looked him in his eyes with disbelief. How did he know about what potions she was taking?"I haven't the faintest idea of what you are referring but- " Astoria began to say."They have side effects. So, watch yourself. Do not mistake my warning as affection for your ass.""Affection! Oh, do not make me laugh. I would never accept affection from you." Astoria said in a snarky tone while letting out a low scoff.Malfoy snorted and got an inch from her face. He stared into her eyes for a mere twenty seconds."Astoria, if you had my affections, you would be ruined for the rest of your days. Just look at Pansy." Malfoy whispered and smirked.Astoria covered her mouth and backed up.She was not very surprised Malfoy regarded himself that high to think any woman would crumble under his touch.Why would he talk about Pansy like that?"Pansy is my fri-friend. If you do anything more to her that makes her mentally think she has a chance at securing you then you have me to deal with. And I am not as easily manipulated. Now get off me."Malfoy released her wrist and gave her painting one last look."It's too bad." Malfoy said lowly turning his head.Astoria turned around again to meet his eyes."Now, what is too bad?" She spat."Maybe if you had better taste in music, I could have a conversation with cultural art with you." Malfoy gave her a wink, whipped out his wand, and apparated.Apparation was not permitted for students to use on Hogwarts grounds, but of course Malfoy did not follow instruction.Astoria was walking back up to the castle when she realized what he had said.Maybe if you had better taste in music...He was watching her.How else would he know what she was listening to her? Astoria kept her cassette player near her, so she did not disturb any magical creatures lurking in the dark. Astoria gripped her emerald necklace and took a deep inhale. She figured now she had a new stalker, and it was Malfoy.The week of waiting was over. Lilla was finally returning to Hogwarts. She had to be sorted into her house, so she went straight to Dumbledore's office and by no surprise she was a Slytherin.Lilla grabbed her friend and pulled her in for a tight embrace."Lill I am beyond happy to see you. I feel so much has happened and I do not even know where to begin!"Lilla gave her friend a friendly smile and they made their way into the great hall for breakfast.It was Quidditch today.Astoria was excited to show off her Slytherin pride and represent her house. It was Slytherin versus Ravenclaw. The first game of the season and the entire school were on the edge of their seats excited to see this game.Astoria sat with Lilla, and Pansy. All three girls had green dots around their eyes and a green S painted on their cheek.It was nearing the end of the game and the two houses were neck in neck. Ravenclaw with twenty and Slytherin with twenty-two.  Lilla took a swig of her flask and she screamed and pointed.Astoria looked over and saw Malfoy had been pushed off his broom and was laying the middle of the field."Oh, my merlin! No! He never gets pushed off! He is too strong for that!" Pansy yelled in worry.Astoria took her friends hand and squeezed."He will be fine. We will go visit him in the infirmary." Astoria said lowly while giving Pansy a reassured smile.Hours had passed before the girls could see Malfoy.Pansy was frantic with worry. Madam Pomfrey told them they only had ten minutes because he was not thinking correctly due to the potions and head trauma.  The girls nodded and entered the hospital ward. There she saw him. Laying still on the hospital bed with his eyes closed.Astoria thought to herself, "With his mouth shut he seems almost angelic."His pale skin.His blond hair.She watched as his chest rose and fell.Pansy immediately took a seat next to him and grabbed his hand.Malfoy awoke instantly and seethed. Ripped his hand away from Pansy's grasp."What are you doing here Parkinson?" Malfoy spat with his upper lip quirked.He had not yet noticed Astoria yet since she was in front of the bed."I was worried for you Draco. You took a nasty spill and that is not like you when you are playing quidditch. What the devil happened?" Pansy's voice cracked and she desperately wanted him to say he was happy to see her, but he did not."I got pushed by some Ravenbitch. I did not even see her coming at me. Before I knew it, I was on the ground, coughing up some blood. Nothing a few healing charms couldn't fix." Malfoy finally realized Astoria was in the room."You brought Greengrass? Aw, were you worried for me?" Malfoy mocked."I am here to support Pansy." Astoria spat while crossing her arms."Cute." Malfoy scoffed."Astoria, could I have a few moments alone with Draco I jus-""Fuck no, Parkinson. Just leave me be right now."Pansy looked at him with a surprised look."Merlin. Draco you act like you can't stand me anymore!" She stood and pushed the chair behind her."Just get the hell out Pansy. I cannot deal with your annoying presence right now."Astoria shot Pansy a sympathetic look and pulled on her friend's arm.Come back later. We have something to discuss.Astoria heard in her head. It was Draco using legilimency. He had done this to her once before in Apparation last term. She made eye contact with him and gave him a slight nod. She guided Pansy back to the dorm and made an excuse to slip away for a while.Astoria had to sneak past Madam Pomfrey and she found Draco asleep. She watched his chest rise and fall with his breaths. She walked over to the window and it must have been the heels of her shoes that snapped him awake."You showed up." He said lowly while sitting up."I was intrigued at why you wanted an audience with me. So, talk." Astoria said while crossing her arms.Astoria took a seat next to his bed, so he did not have to strain to look at her. Malfoy was still an injured man and she was not totally heartless."Tell me about your migraines." Draco murmerred.Astoria gave him an irritated look."Really? You made me sneak away from Pansy to have a discussion with you about my migraines? Don't you have your own head to worry about?""Stop being a bitch and have a conversation with me, Greengrass. I have now found you on the ground twice because of your head problems. Now, stop being stubborn and tell me what you feel." Draco spat. His expression was cold and his eyes stone gray.Astoria shook her head and took a deep inhale. Waited twenty seconds or so and looked Malfoy in the eyes."I feel as if someone is splitting my skull open with a knife. Recently, I have been hearing a voice in my head. A man's voice. Calling my name. Every time I hear the voice my blood begins to be stricken and my head feels as if a million needles are penetrating me." Astoria murmured while looking around the room trying not to meet his gaze. Draco looked down and began fiddling with his Slytherin ring."Tell me why you ask." She pleaded."A friend told me about a girl in her defense dark arts class who nearly collapsed from head pains when she first arrived to Hogwarts. That was you wasn't it?" Draco inquired.Astoria nodded and shrugged her shoulders. She grabbed hold of her emerald necklace and Malfoy noticed it."Family heirloom?" Malfoy asked pointing to the emerald.Astoria nodded. "It belonged to my fathers' mother who was also a Slytherin. It is supposed to protect me against dark magic.""I would like to ask you something now." Astoria asked and leaned in.Malfoy nodded slightly and looked away from her."The day Cedric died. I collapsed and I felt someone lift me and take me to the hospital ward..." She hesitated. "It was you. Was it not?"Malfoy paused for a minute. Thinking about what he was going to say."It was." He said quietly and coldly."Why? If you hate me so much. Why come to my aid? Pansy and Lilla were there. I am sure one of them could hav- ""Neither was fast enough. You were on the ground clutching your head and screaming. What else was I supposed to do? You were a woman screaming in pain. I am not a monster Greengrass, no matter what picture you paint in your head about me." Draco said lowly while fiddling with his Slytherin ring.Astoria scoffed. "I have not painted no such monstrous picture of you in my head." She said sarcastically.Malfoy scoffed and quirked his eyebrow. He did not believe her."If you are interested in my theory of you. I will share it." She said lowly while meeting his eyes.Astoria was nervous. She did not know if she was ready to relay the opinion she had on Malfoy to Malfoy himself. What if he got angry and called her a whore, again? What if he slapped her? She would slap him back. Malfoy nodded and agreed to listen."I believe you are conflicted. Conflicted with being one man people are afraid of but on the inside, you are desperate for affection and mental companionship." She admitted lowly.There was silence. Malfoy laughed abruptly. Astoria was offended."You think I need affection Greengrass? I can get all the affection I want from any girl in this school." Draco said boldly while cocking his head to the side and letting out a low laugh.Astoria leaned in and whispered in his face."All except me." Astoria smirked and sat back in her chair."For now." Malfoy stared into her eyes. She noticed in this moment he had grey eyes. Beautiful grey stormy eyes. She pictured Malfoy's mine being a bed of grey stormy clouds. When you get close enough to touch oneit either evaporates and his thoughts are revealed or the closer you got thefurther the clouds got.
  
    Chapter Text
    1995"One day he is going to return for her and that is the moment when she is going to realize she is not like other girls. Thomas, we cannot let him to get her, we cannot let him take her, we-we-" Eloise slid against the wall with her hands gripping her hair."Eloise. Sweetheart, I need you to calm down." Thomas wrapped his arms around his wife and cradled her head in his shoulder."You knew the bargain we made before she was born. If he returns, eventually, he will come for her. He is going to claim what he feels is his. We are going to do what we can to protect our daughter. I am not going to let anyone harm her. She is ours."Astoria's eyes snapped open. She felt the sweat dripping off her face and onto her neck. She tried to remember that memory, it must have happened when she was a young girl. Were her parents talking about her? If they were, why are they talking in a sense that she was owned by another person?Astoria tried desperately to remember the rest of the conversation, but the memory slipped away as quickly as it came. She had to rise and get ready for the day.Divination was a class Astoria never took before. It was not offered at Beaxubaton Academy, so she was eager to see what the class entailed. She was always interested in learning about the future and what was ahead for her."Welcome my children! Come! Come! Sit, sit. Time to get started."Professor Trelawney dressed like a girl who could not let go of the 70s and Astoria wondered if she dabbled with the muggle drug marijuana. She seemed to be cooked within the clouds when she was discussing the future or the deaths of her students.Astoria was sat at a table with Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. Astoria was thrilled to see Harry again; she had not seemed him since the prior year at the Yule Ball. He became such a good friend to her. Astoria still did not know much about Granger. She seemed to be reserved and not open to making friends, especially Slytherin friends."What do you see in the crystal my dear? Can you decipher the message?" Trelawney said while staring deeply into Astoria's eyes. She began to grow a little uneasy with such close eye contact, but she quickly realized that was Trelawney's way of communicating."Uhm-Ahh- I see a bunch of smoke?" Astoria gave a confused look and sigh."Smoke? That means currently, your future is unclear..." Granger said."Unclear? Meaning?"Trelawney leaned him, taking hold of Astoria's hand."My dear, it could mean, very soon you will be faced with a life altering decision. I fear. If you choose wrong, you will not have a future to predict."Astoria's eyes widened and began to pool. She could feel her chest begin to feel heavy. She felt Harry take her hand and Hermione place her hand on her shoulder."Tori! Relax. You mustn't listen to this. Something divination can be totally bonkers."Hermione gave Harry a look and continued to hold Astoria's shoulder."Harry is right, Astoria. I think divination is rubbish. I mean, why would a glass ball predict the future. You make your own path!"Astoria could barely breathe until the class concluded."I need a smoke. I'll catch up with you guys later." Astoria gave a short wave and strutted outside for a calming cigarette. She wished she had some marijuana on her to calm her nerves, but she only gets a hold of that when she visits the muggle side of London.Astoria sat on her bed for hours and refused to join her friends for dinner. She just wanted to be alone, listen to her Stevie records and think about all the things she does not have.She made a mental list.Love.Physical affection.Weed.A larger butt.Larger tits.A more defined jawline.Her insecurities were coming through more and more. She regarded herself in her bathroom mirror, naked.To other people she was thin, had perky breasts, a beautiful smile and gorgeous hair. She saw thighs that were slightly too big, teeth that were straight but not quite white enough, a slight double chin when she smiled and her small boobs.She made her way over to the window and sat on the sill, opened her potions text and began studying.Studying always took her mind off what was bothering her. And currently the only two things were he imperfect body and the feeling of making a life altering decision revolving around her maybe death."Why did you not come down for dinner?" Pansy asked as she bursted into the room nearly causing Astoria to drop her book.Astoria felt more skittish than usual. More anxious."Apologies. I just did not feel like eating." Astoria shrugged while continuing to read her book."How about we go on an adventure?" Pansy inched toward Astoria."Adventure?" Astoria put down her book and her eyes lit up with excitement."Malfoy and Zabini are going to London for the weekend. Let us crash their party!" Pansy said while grabbing Astoria's hands."Oh. Pans. I don't know. I told Lilla I would spend some time with her tomorrow. I had not seen her much since her initial arrival.""We'll take her with us! It will be fun! A girl weekend. We will not even see much of the boys. They are probably going to use an aging charm and go out to the pubs. We can find a fancy hotel, drink wine, smoke and talk boy problems. Please I need this." Pansy implored her friend.Astoria pondered for a while. She really needed this time away, even if it was for only a couple days. Plus she knew this would make her feel better mentally and physically."Let's do it. I will send word to Lilla. I am sure she won't say no."The three girls apparated in front of one of the most expensive muggle hotels in London."Reservation for Parkinson please. I believe I reserved a suite for the weekend. I would like your finest red wine and some champagne please."The concierge looked at the three girls and quirked an eyebrow."I'm sorry. Are you all eighteen?"The legal drinking age in the United Kingdom is eighteen. Astoria almost forgot that tiny factor since in France the legal age is sixteen if the girl is present with an adult.Pansy leaned in and muttered a corporation charm toward the concierge. He immediately smiled and handed her a key."Enjoy your stay girls. Drinks shall be delivered straight away. Give us a ring if you need anything more."Pansy gave him a wink and the girls walked away.The suite was gorgeous and even smelled expensive.Three queen sized beds. A mini fridge filled with delicious snacks. A large clawfoot bathtub, followed by a walk-in shower. There was a piano in the middle of the sitting room. Astoria loved the piano, she wished she knew how to play. The walls were all white with gold trim, very elegant."Merlin, Pansy. How can you afford this!" Lilla blurted out."Oh, do not thank me. Thank Daddy Parkinson."All three girls laughed and leaned in for a hug.The wine and champagne arrived.Pansy poured champagne into three glasses and handed them out."A toast. To a fabulous, drunken weekend with my two finest ladies.""Cheers!""Cheers!"Clink. Clink. Clink. The girls decided to play some music and get the party started. Pansy put on Girls Just Want to Have Fun by Cyndi Lauper, a classic. Astoria was a fan of all the 70s, 80s and new age 90s music."All you whores sit down and let's have a much-needed conversation." Lilla said."Parkinson. We are starting with you. What is up with you and Mr. Snooty Pants Malfoy? Are you two boning or are you destined for each other?" Lilla asked.Pansy began to fidget with her glass and her face fell slightly."I do not know what we are. When I went to go visit him in the hospital it seemed he was repulsed by me. It never used to be like that. We used to be close friends. He was my first lay and I grew feelings for him. Now I think he fancies someone else. I just do not know who." Pansy said as she looked down into her glass.Astoria felt bad for Pansy. Astoria did not know who Malfoy was currently eyeing, but she knew it was not Pansy. Malfoy will always have his own agenda."Greengrass. I am sorry to bring this up, but I am a little drunk, but when are you going to get laid again? Honey, I know you miss Cedric, but he is gone babe. You really need someone to hit that and rock your world."Astoria bursted out laughing. She did not need someone to "rock her world." She was quite content with herself. When she was not lonely."I am perfectly happy thank you. Not sure if I will ever feel that kind of touch again. Maybe I am not meant to find an everlasting love. Maybe I am destined for something much greater and meaningful.""Cheers to that my darling friend." Lilla said and she pulled her friend into a tight, long embrace.After some hours of exchanging secrets, going through an entire bottle of wine, the girls were not done with their night."Let us go to the pub downtown. It is only eleven o'clock and I can put the aging charm on us to make us eighteen."Lilla and Astoria agreed. All three girls began to get ready for their night-out.Astoria put on a slim red dress followed by some high heels. She wore her emerald as always, and a pair of diamond snake earrings.It had been over a year since she was at a pub and she was ready to dance. Ready to let loose and not worry about the next day. The night was young.The girls apparated from the hotel to the back door of the pub."Wait ladies. I have something to get the mood of the nightlife started."Lilla reached into her bag and pulled out a bag of cocaine.Astoria usually never dabbled with hard drugs, but she was feeling adventurous.Lilla poured lines on a nearby car and the girls each snorted a line.Astoria began to see her world turn and she was seeing stars."I-I-I am READY." Astoria shouted and she started running and running until she was at the front of the door."ID's ladies." The bouncer said.Pansy stepped in front and muttered a charm."Enjoy your night."The bouncer stepped aside, and Astoria saw the beautiful nightclub lights."Let's go dance bitches." Lilla said as she hooked arms with both girls.Astoria tilted her head back and began to dance her heart out.She could feel the affects of the cocaine in her mind and she just wanted to let loose. Astoria climbed onto the stage and began dancing with a random man. She rubbed up against him and began grinding on him slightly.The girls went over to the bar and downed lemon drop shots.The drinks were flowing, and everyone was having a good time.Astoria was out on the dancefloor dancing with a random man when she felt someone grab her wrist. She got pulled from the dancefloor and into a random hallway. Her eyes were half closed, and she was not mentally alright. The drugs were affecting her motor skills."What the bloody hell is going on Greengrass!"Astoria heard someone yell in her face over the music.She finally opened her eyes and saw him.It was Draco Malfoy.His beautiful grey eyes were looking into hers.She began to open her mouth, but her head dipped back, barely hitting the wall.Malfoy put his hands on either side of Astoria's head to keep her head up."What the fuck are you on drugs?" Malfoy asked."Ahaha. What is it to you Mr-Mr-Mr-Constible. Are you going to' turn me in? Vous bel homme." Astoria managed to spit out.Malfoy laughed to himself."I always knew you thought I was good looking." Malfoy said while he smirked and quirked an eyebrow at her."You-You- speak French?" Astoria was more than embarrassed.Malfoy leaned in an inch from her face."There are a lot of things you do not know about me, Greengrass."Astoria quirked her head back and managed to keep herself balanced."What are you even doing here Malfoy? Shouldn't you be out with Blaise getting wrecked somewhere?""We were. Then I saw you all coked up on the dance floor. I realized Pansy talked you into coming to London for the weekend."Astoria shrugged, not meeting his eyes."I needed a break.""I am going out for a smoke. Later."Malfoy grabbed her by the arm."No, you're not. Let's go.""Uhh-no. I am here with my friends. I am having fun."Malfoy leaned in and looked into her eyes."The fun is over. Let's. Go. Greengrass."Malfoy was serious, but Astoria was as willful as he was.Astoria inched in touching her chest to his. She looked up at him with intent."Fucking make me, Draco." Astoria said while beginning to attempt to walk away.Without a hesitation Draco grabbed her and pulled her over his shoulder and walked her out. When they went out the back door, he apparated them to his hotel room."PUT ME DOWN. ARE YOU INSANE?" Astoria shouted.Malfoy set her down on the couch and back away. He poured himself a fire whiskey neat.He downed it and just looked at her.She scoffed and walked onto the terrace."Why did you bring me here! We are not even friends Malfoy. Why do you have to affect what I am doing with MY life."Malfoy leaned against the doorway and just kept staring at her. Kept drinking his whiskey not making a sound."Not going to say anything. Well, I am fucking leaving you loon."Astoria attempted to walk past him until he stepped in front of her."Say something." She said while looking into his eyes."You should not be doing cocaine."Astoria rolled her eyes and began to pace."I just wanted to feel alive. I just wanted to feel something."Astoria felt her body begin to shake and her eyes begin to pool.She wanted to badly to be touched. To feel love or affection.She was so young, but she desperately needed physical contact."There are plenty of other things you can do to feel alive rather than do drugs."Astoria scoffed and looked up at him with determination."Oh- should I do what you do? Fuck girls and then get them to fall in love with me and them treat them like trash? You really fucked with Pansy's head Malfoy. She loves you and you treat her like garbage.""I don't care about Pansy.""Yeah. That is your problem."There was a silence for two minutes."Pour me a drink." Astoria said.Malfoy handed her a fire whiskey on the rocks and took a seat next to her on the terrace.Astoria noticed that when Draco is nervous, he fiddles with his ring with the Slytherin "S" on it. She found it ironic because when she is anxious, she fiddles with her snake emerald necklace."Do I make you nervous?" Astoria leaned in facing him, putting her elbows on her knees."Why would someone like you make someone like me nervous?""You're fiddling with your ring. That is a sign of anxiety. I studied psychology in France for some time. I find the human mind quite fascinating."Astoria kept taking sips of her whiskey and could still feel some of the affects from the drugs and alcohol."I am just not sure why I brought you back here. I should have returned you to your hotel. I am sure Parkinson is worried for you."Astoria shrugged."She knows I know my way home." Astoria took a deep breath. "I think you needed someone to talk to."Malfoy snorted and laughed. He took another swig of his drink and looked over at Astoria.He was looking at her. Regarding her it seemed. She felt his eyes burning through her. It made her nervous."I must be bonkers, but in this light, you're attractive Greengrass."Astoria choked on her drink and coughed."Well. A compliment. I never thought I would see the day."Malfoy leaned in."Vous êtes une belle femme." He whispered toward her.He called her a beautiful woman in French.She did not know what to do or say.Did he want something from her?He looked into her eyes and rolled her thumb around the rim of the glass.Astoria's breathing became heavy.She kept looking at his mouth. He was looking at hers.Malfoy stood and went back into the room to pour another drink.Something inside pushed Astoria to get up and follow him.He was pouring his drink and she was behind him.When he turned, he was facing her, looking down at her.She was looking at his grey eyes, and then his mouth.The tension build was strenuous. She wanted to be touched. She wanted to be held.She did not know if it was the liquid courage or the drug courage, but she rose on her tip toes and attempted to kiss him.Malfoy put his hand on her shoulder to reject her."Greengrass. No. We cannot. We should not." Malfoy whispered as he looks into her eyes. He looked so lonely.Astoria finally snapped out of her enhanced trance and turned around."No. No I am sorry. I am out of my mind. It's the alcohol." She had her hands on her head and began to pace.She bolted for the terrace and lit a cigarette.Malfoy leaned against the doorway watching her."If you say anything about my smoking this is getting flung right at you."Malfoy put his hands in the air and backed down.He walked towards her slowly and made her face him.Malfoy put his hand to the side of her hair and ran his thumb down her cheek."It's not your fault. It is mine. I led you on, but this, this cannot happen. I am not someone who can get tangled up with someone else."Astoria closed her eyes because she feared she would cry.Something inside her broke. She felt broken again.Why did she care so much? She was merely seeking companionship."I need to go. Goodnight Malfoy.""I'll see you in school, Greengrass."Astoria apparated and found herself back at the hotel.She was confused about what just happened.She tried to kiss Draco Malfoy and he rejected her. Why? He called her beautiful.Things were not making sense to her anymore.

    1999With a short crack of sound Astoria appeared in front of the tall hedges and walkway of Malfoy Manor. Before she would walk through the gates she decided to have a cigarette to calm her nerves. So many thoughts were plowing through her mind as she took short drags.Astoria had not seen Granger since the day she almost gauged her eyes out with her nails. She found them. She found him all over her.She hated Granger with a passion. But still had a deep love for Draco that she had to find a way for the mudblood to remain unharmed in the upcoming war.The Dark Lord is planning on experimenting on mudbloods to discover a curse to extract magic from any witch or wizard that is not blood pure.Astoria had mixed feelings, but she had to shove any doubts she had in the way back of her mind. No one will be able to see her innermost thoughts.She was a trained in the art of occlumency. She learned at a young age that her mind was sacred and any thought that was special to her needed to be pushed to the back.Astoria walked to the back of the estate to the rose gardens. She touched the petals with her fingers and adored looking at the vibrant colors.She wondered if she would ever again be free.You are as beautiful as a rose my dear. You surely have blossomed into the most desirable woman.Astoria flinched at the memory and walked away from the rose garden.She did not enjoy thinking about her master. The memories of him regarding her, speaking softy into her ear. Saying things that turned her blood cold.She walked into the manor to find none of the Malfoy's were at home.Soon a small elf named Topsy appeared before her."Hello Miss. The Master and his family have left for the night. Would you let Topsy bring some dinner to your quarters?"Topsy seemed to be an old elf. She had green eyes and was wearing rags and no shoes.Astoria gave a short nod and the tiny elf disappeared.This would be the perfect time for her to wander the manor without interruptions.She found it was odd the Malfoy's went away without announcing but she paid no mind.Astoria was only at the manor once before her initial arrival. The estate was so enormous it was difficult for anyone to see all of it in one visit.She walked through the halls, investigated rooms, and eventually found one interesting room.It was a room with a king-sized bed, a dark oak dresser, a bookshelf filled with interesting reads, a record player, and a nicely sized bathroom.It was Draco's room.Astoria could tell by the smell of the room. It smelled like papyrus and his cologne.She walked over to the window and noticed he had a view of the gardens below.She thought to herself what a room to be able to paint in with such a view.Astoria made her way over the dresser. There were a few pieces of memorabilia lying about.A Slytherin "Seeker" badge.Two quills followed by a piece of parchment lying beneath.A book titled, "Pride and Prejudice." One of Astoria's favorite books.As she looked under another book there was a photo of Lilla, Theo, Draco and Astoria in the Slytherin common room.Draco had his arm around Astoria, and she had her hand on his knee. They were smiling at each other while Theo and Lilla smiled at the camera.So much happiness in one picture.As she was memorizing the photo the door bursted open and she dropped it."Roaming about?" Draco said as she walked toward her with his eyebrow quirked.Astoria gathered herself and put on a strong façade."Well. I was left here alone so what else was I supposed to do? Not very polite to leave your fiancé without announcement." Astoria rose her eyebrows.Draco scoffed and snatched the picture away.Draco did not say anything. He began to try and lead Astoria out of his room."I remember when that was taken. It was at the end of our sixth year. Before- "Astoria stopped herself."It was a long time ago." Draco said while looking down.Astoria was confused. Why did he still have that photo?Astoria stopped and faced the pale blond before her."Wh-Why do you still have that picture laying about?" Astoria asked almost pathetic sounding.Draco gave a low laugh and looked Astoria in the eyes."I was going through old trash that needed to be discarded. I just did not get around to tossing that photograph out yet." He said in a cold tone.Astoria felt her heart crush. She knew Draco was not fond of her anymore, but she did not think he hated her.They were going to be husband and wife. She needed to push old memories to the back of her mind.Astoria hesitated before speaking. She straightened her posture and put the tip of her pointed finger under Draco's chin."Don't you remember what happened that year Draco?" Astoria said while smirking at him."We would sneak off to the astronomy tower and you would kiss me for hours. Tell me how you would always yearn for me. I was yours and you were mine. The type of fire that you can feel throughout your body." Astoria's body was pushed up against his. Hoping he would react to what she was saying."Yes Astoria. I remember. I would advise you to stop reminiscing about your past and face reality. That was the year I realized who you were. You chose one path and I chose another."Astoria glanced up at Draco."And... yet here we are. Our paths led to each other again."Draco hesitated and pulled away."No, Astoria. You are not the girl I thought you were that is why- ""You fucked her didn't you." Astoria yelled.She felt her chest begin to heave. She had not seen Draco since the Battle of Hogwarts. Destiny took her on a path away from him for a while. She saw him and everything came rushing back. The love she felt. She thought she could repress it back with occlumency. She remembered everything that got taken from her that night."Astoria. I am not discussing this further with you. If you would be so kind to go to your quarters and leave me be. I have pressing matters to attend to."With that Astoria felt something around her neck begin to burn.She was being summoned."As do I. Do not wait up for me. I shall return home when I am finished with my meeting."Astoria strutted out of the room and out the front door.Her Master was calling upon her.
  
    Chapter Text
    1995Astoria could feel his hands on her waist, his breath on her skin, and his lips on the base of her shoulders. She let out a small whimper and did not want the sensation to subside. His fingers traced the sides of body. His pointer finger applied a sense of pressure when sliding up the sides of her rib cage. She lifted her arms to cradle his head and pull his hair. She felt him place passionate kisses along the back of her neck and on the top of her shoulder. Astoria felt adrenaline build up in her body, especially below her abdomen. She wanted this. She needed this. She spun around to cup the mans face in her palms and looked into his eyes.It was Draco Malfoy staring down at her with hungry eyes.He began to slip off her dress with his fingers when Astoria's eyes snapped open. She realized she had been dreaming. She had her first sexual dream about Malfoy.It had been a couple of weeks since the encounter with Malfoy in London. Astoria had not told her friends about her trying to kiss him because she knew Pansy fancied Draco. So, she decided to keep to herself and not hurt her friends' feelings.But lately, Astoria only had one thing on her mind.Sex.She was becoming obsessed with idea that to feel like herself again she needed to get someone in bed with her. Astoria's head was spinning with the idea of getting laid.She was beginning to fall off the deep end, but she figured once she got her fix everything would fall into place.Astoria tried her best to shove the memories to the back of her mind. She did not want to always have Malfoy on her mind, but he was intoxicating. The things she thought about him doing to her was staring to cloud her mind. She needed a release.Astoria was walking to charms class when she noticed Blaise Zabini standing at the doorway. He was looking rather attractive lately. Astoria shook her head and walked past him, and she noticed he shot her a smile.Blaise ended up taking a seat next to Astoria which she thought was odd because she barely knew him or spoke to him, other than when he was with Malfoy."Hey Greengrass. Are you having a splendid Wednesday?" Blaise said while setting his book down on the desk."Oh-hey Blaise. Yeah, I guess I am." Astoria said awkwardly. Blaise leaned in to speak softy to Astoria."I know about you and Malfoy. He told me. Don't worry I won't tell anyone you fancy him." Blaise said while slightly nudging Astoria."Oh goodness I do not fancy Malfoy. I was drunk out of my mind in London. It was a fluke. Plus, I am sure Malfoy finds me repulsive, which is why he rejected me." Astoria said while shrugging her shoulders.She was hoping Blaise would drop the subject and not mention Draco anymore. He was already on her mind so much; she did not want to add to the fire with "what if." Blaise leaned in gripping Astoria's hand making her look at him."If it were me, I would have let you kiss me without question. In my opinion, Malfoy fucked up." Blaise said and winked at Astoria.Astoria was astounded. Blaise had barely ever spoken to her and now out of nowhere it sounded as if he was making a pass at her. Did he want something? She certainly did. Astoria was tired of being a proper lady, she wanted to get into some mischief and do something outrageous.Astoria leaned over and squeezed Blaise's knee."Well. Maybe I went for the wrong Slytherin. I never knew you regarded me that way Zabini." Astoria said softly."You are the sexiest witch I ever laid eyes on, Greengrass." Blaise said lowly.Astoria felt on the top of the world. Fuck Malfoy. He obviously did not want Astoria, so she was going to go for someone who did."Common room at eight later?" Astoria inquired with a slight hesitation in her tone.Blaise nodded and charms class had begun.The clock struck eight and Astoria showed up at the common room and Blaise was there standing by the fire. Blaise walked toward Astoria with hunger in his eyes.She kept telling herself, she wanted this, she needed this. She missed physical affection. She only needed to kiss him to feast her sexual hunger.Astoria strutted over to Blaise and connected their lips. Nothing burned inside Astoria for his touch, but she figured Blaise would do.She felt his hands grip her waist and she cupped his face with her hands. She slipped her tongue in his mouth and massaged his tongue with hers. His hands slipped up to the front of her shirt and began to cup her breast.She was not feeling any sort of arousal by his touch. Nothing was getting tamed inside her.Blaise attempted to unbutton Astoria's shirt when Pansy bursted through the painting into the common room."Blaise? Tori? Why hello there." Pansy said while she strutted in with her books.Astoria and Blaise immediately subsided from their kiss. Blaise became pale and was in shock at what just happened."Oh-hey Pans. I did not know you were coming back early." Blaise said while fixing his shirt."Yeah-I got done studying early. I must have missed an interesting make-out session. I did not know you two were shagging up." Pansy said while crossing her arms and cracking a smirk."We're not!" Astoria shouted.Blaise shot Astoria a look in defeat, almost as if he were offended. She felt a pit in her stomach form and she was horribly uncomfortable in the situation. She did not want Blaise to think she was using him, but the evidence was against her."Sorry-um. This was just a one-time thing. Nothing more. Let us head to the dorm. Bye Blaise." Astoria gave a short wave and ran up the staircase to her dorm room.Pansy busted through the door with a look of shock on her face."Astoria Greengrass. What the actual fuck, girl." Pansy spat.Pansy began to place her books down on her bed and she plopped down next to Astoria. Astoria was lying back on her bed with her arms over her face."Pans. I have no idea what is wrong with me. Like why I would kiss Blaise and we almost-you know-before you walked in, and the sick part is I would have let it happen. Even though I felt absolutely nothing the entire time." Astoria admitted lowly.Pansy took her friends hand and held it."Baby. It is okay to feel horny. What has gotten into you though? I know you have not shagged anyone since Diggory but why the sudden urge?" Pansy said while furrowing her brows.Astoria felt embarrassed. She did not want to be known as the friend who was always looking for a quick bone. What Astoria truly wanted was some companionship. Someone to go to at night when she was feeling alone or someone to hold her when she cried. She desperately wanted a partner."It is nothing. I am fine. This was a one-time thing. I am going to go shower and wash Zabini's cologne off me. It reeks." Astoria said while grabbing her shower belongings.Both girls laughed and Astoria strutted into the loo.After another long day of classes Astoria decided to relax in the common room with a good book. Astoria enjoyed reading and escaping with her mind.When she walked through the painting Malfoy was in there. In his quidditch uniform. It looks like he had just returned from practice and he was starting a scroll assignment for charms."Greengrass." Malfoy said coldly while not looking at Astoria."Malfoy." Astoria said while taking a seat next to the window.Astoria wanted to pretend he was not there, but she could feel every so often his eyes were on her. Watching. Studying her. After twenty minutes she snapped her book shut and made her way over to the couches."Alright. What are you staring at?" Astoria spat while cocking her head and placing her hand on her head.Malfoy kept his eyes on his scroll."Currently, my charms assessment. Now, if you please." Malfoy imitated a "shoo" hand movement hoping Astoria would leave him be."No. You are watching me. I can feel it. I am not stupid." Astoria spat while trying catch his gaze."You can be." He said sternly.Astoria was floored by his comment."Pardon? What did you just say to me?" She inquired with an irritant tone.Malfoy finally looked up from his scroll and leaned in toward her."You have tendencies to act stupid, Greengrass."Astoria shook her head and snatched the parchment from his grasp."Merlin. What the fuck Greengrass. Hand it over!" Malfoy shouted."Explain your reasoning." She spat.Malfoy looked at her and smirked."You know Blaise won't keep quiet about you. You led him on. That was a stupid move. You bobble-head Beauxbaton." Malfoy said while grabbing the parchment back."I can do as I please. I am not tied to anyone." Astoria said while straightening her posture and her shirt."Maybe if you did not whore yourself around you could find someone who would actually care for you, but you decide to snog any man in sight." Malfoy sneered.He seemed angry. But why would he be? He denied their kiss. It was her lips he could have touched with his. He blew his chances in London when he denied her. So why would he care who she snogged."I do not understand why you care so much who I snog. You made that clear in London when you rejected me." Astoria said in defeat.Malfoy met her gaze with his cold, gray eyes."Get used to it." He spat lowly.Astoria's mouth dropped. He was not a gentleman."You know Malfoy. You keep treating women as you do, you're going to end up alone and unloved." Astoria said while standing up."Some people are not meant to be loved." Malfoy said without looking up, but his quill hesitated.Astoria was walking away from him as she turned her head toward him."That makes two of us." Astoria admitted pathetically.Astoria walked up to her dorm room and took out a record. She began playing the song Eleanor Rigby by The Beatles and listened to the tune on repeat.Oh, look at all the lonely people.She was sitting on her bed, doodling inside her paperback sketch book until she realized what she made.She made a doodle of her patronus.Astoria's patronus was a black pantherAstoria's patronus was a black panther.Fierce.Dark.Strong.Astoria had only ever been able to conjure her patronus once when she was in her third year at Beauxbaton. She figured she had not been happy enough since to conjure one.Lilla came into Astoria's room."I can tell you are down in the dumps by The Beatles music. You always play this song when you're feeling lonesome. What's wrong doll face?" Lilla said while lying next to her friend. Astoria moved to her friend and hugged her. Her eyes became to pool."Lill. I do not know what to do. I am so confused about everything. About who I am, about what I want or who I want. I mean, I kissed Blaise a few days ago for no god-damn reason. Merlin, I am a mess!" Astoria said while covering her face.Lilla stayed silent and listened to her friend."I am scared I am falling off the deep end. My mind is in a whirlwind of emotions. One day I feel strong, another I feel defeated. Maybe moving here was a mistake."Lilla sat up brining Astoria with her and she cupped her face in her hands."It was not a mistake, it was a gut feeling you had. You knew the person you were turning into in France was not you. You are going to blossom here. You are a strong fucking woman Tori. You have been through so much. This is only the beginning of your life. You are meant to live an extraordinary life. Trust me." Lilla said boldly while giving her friend a warm smile.Lilla's words felt comforting to Astoria's soul. She trusted her best friends judgement.Lilla knew Astoria's soul and mind. She knew she was just going through a rough patch and eventually everything will hash out."Lilla. I need to confide in you and please. Do not tell Pansy."Lilla shook her head and scoffed."Please. You are my best friend. That bitch will not know a thing." Lilla said while smiled."Okay uhm-I- "Lilla put her hand over Astoria's mouth."Quiet. Someone is listening."Lilla always had a knack for knowing if someone was eavesdropping. She had the hearing capacity of an elephant Astoria always thought.Lilla muttered silencio under her breath.Lilla nodded and cued Astoria to continue."Okay. Well. When we were in London, I left the pub with Draco, and he took me back to his hotel room and we- "Lilla's mouth dropped."Oh my god you guys shagged up! I knew it!" Lilla said excitedly.Astoria shook her head."Quite the opposite. I tried to kiss him, and he rejected me. He told me he cannot get tangled up with someone and it was his fault for leading me on. I was basically broken but I got over it. Until I started having sex dreams about him, well in my dreams we have not had sex, but it is leading up to it. Right as I look in his eyes, I snap open awake."Lilla pondered at what her friend was saying to her."Well babe. You know what they say. People only have sex dreams about another person if that other person has you on their mind quite a bit. Maybe Malfoy is also thinking about you." Lilla said while leaning back onto the four-poster bed.Astoria always wondered if Draco ever thought about her. What they could be together, a real power couple. A great Slytherin house couple. Ready to take on anyone. But she came back down to the realization that that will never happen. He did not want her in that way. If anything it seemed he wanted to protect her more than anything.It would explain him apparating her to the infirmary and when he showed up at the pub when she was coked out of her mind.Astoria lyed back down on her bed, flicked her wand to play another record. This time she was listening to Gold Dust Woman by Fleetwood Mac.Just as the record was about to end Pansy ran into the dorm room in a panic. Lilla and Astoria shot up from the bed.Pansy was trying to catch her breath. It looks like she had run a great distance. There were tears in her eyes."Draco and Blaise just beat the shit out of each other in the great hall. Draco punched Blaise so hard he knocked a tooth out! Then I had seen Blaise punch Draco right on the nose. They are both being hauled to the infirmary!" Pansy blurted out.Lilla and Astoria both a shot a look at one another. Why would two best friends be fighting? And over what? The three girls ran toward the hospital wing.When Astoria came into the ward, she found Blaise with a black eye, unconscious and Draco sitting up in a hospital bed with a busted nose and lip. Pansy raced over toward Malfoy and looked at his face."Merlin Draco! What on earth were you two fighting about!" Pansy said while attempting to touch Draco's face but he shooed her hand away.Astoria's eyes met with Draco's. He did not answer Pansy but instead summoned a pain relief potion from across the room and downed it."You look like shit Malfoy. Blaise really did a number on you." Lilla said while she slightly chuckled."Fuck off ... whatever your name is." Malfoy sneered.Lilla gave Astoria a look. She remained silent.She bit her upper lip and then she heard Blaise wake up. She made her way over to him."Hey Blaise. How are you?" Astoria inquired while giving him a warm smile.Blaise eyes snapped open and he jerked back away from her."Get the hell away from me. Haven't you done enough?" Blaise spat.Astoria was confused. What was he talking about?"Uhm. What? What do you mean?" She inquired lowly."Why don't you ask your boyfriend over there. Apparently, he is quite sensitive when you are discussed." Blaise said while cocking his head toward Malfoy in the next bed.The fight was about her. Blaise was talking about Astoria and Malfoy punched him in the face as punishment. Pansy's eyes met Astoria's and then snapped back over to Draco's."Uhm. Since when are you two together?" Pansy asked quietly.Malfoy scoffed and he finally spoke."We're not fucking together Parkinson. Calm yourself." Malfoy said coldly.Astoria kept her eyes low. She was embarrassed.
  
    Chapter Text
    1995Smoke filled the air. Astoria held the cigarette between her French tipped fingers. She heard someone creep up behind her."Tori?" The voice said.Astoria turned around and it was Harry."Oh-hi Harry. I'm sorry I did not hear you come outside." Astoria said lowly.Harry took a seat on the bench next to Astoria. He seemed to be a little shocked to see her smoking, but Astoria was used to be judging her for her bad habits. Astoria took another drag of the cigarette. She lifted the cigarette up."Old habits die hard." She admitted.Harry leaned in. "Have you been smoking a long time?" Harry asked while trying to sound less judgmental.  Astoria rolled her eyes and stomped on the bud."I smoke when I am stressed or need a quick release. I have gotten a load on my mind Harry. I implore you to not lecture me on my bad habits." She nudged him and hoped he would drop the subject.Astoria noticed Harry's hand was scarred and bruised. It seemed as if someone was carving on his hand with a knife."Merlin, Harry. What the hell happened to your hand?" Astoria said and she reached for his hand and inspected it.Harry quickly snatched it away and hid it under a book."I am fine. It is nothing. I had detention with Umbridge, and she has her own ways of discipline." He admitted pathetically.Dolores Umbridge worked for the Ministry of Magic. She was a beastly woman who always wore a shade of pink bright enough to make anyone gag. Astoria had her for her DADA class, but she kept her head low and her mouth shut to avoid trouble. She knew what Umbridge was capable of and she was not about to have her hand mangled but an enchanted quill.Which is why Astoria had to result in smoking in secluded areas. Smoking was strictly prohibited on Hogwarts grounds ever since Dolores step foot on school grounds."Tori. May I speak plainly?" Harry inquired while meeting her eyes.Astoria looked up, gave him a warm grin and took Harry's hand in consolation."Of course. What is on your mind?"Harry hesitated for a moment to gather his thoughts, he took a deep breath, and turned to face Astoria."I am scared for you. You seem different. I am not sure how to describe it, but whenever I am around you, I get this feeling." He muttered while reaching for his scar.Astoria nudged at him and smiled."Aww Harry are you trying to tell me you fancy me? You shouldn't ha- ""No. Tori. I am quite serious." Harry interjected sharply. "Something about you is different and it is not simple to explain. Please do not be angry with me but I do not think we should associate with one another any longer. I cannot explain why." Harry said breathlessly.Astoria was offended. What did he mean she changed? Just because she drank and dabbled at some drugs, once, she was automatically in danger?Astoria's first thought was to yell at him and leave him astounded by her hurtful words, but she cared about Harry. He was her friend. One of her first when she arrived to Hogwarts last year. Harry was her Yule Ball date when no one else wanted to take her after the Cedric incident.Astoria collected herself with dignity before she spoke. She did not want to lose Harry right away, so she wanted to be as kind as possible.She reached up for Harry's cheek and cupped his face. Making his eyes meet hers."Harry, Please do not worry for me. I just have a lot on my mind right now. I promise I am okay. I may have changed slightly and that is because I am still adjusting to my new surroundings. Please, give me time to get over the culture shock." Astoria said lowly while giving him a warm grin.Harry's expression soon turned relaxed and he gave her a small smile. Harry nodded and reached to hug her, and she gave him a tight embrace."I am sorry for lashing out it's just-" Harry started to say when Astoria began pulling away, she felt her head being invaded. As if a dagger was carving through her mind and ripping apart her occlumency.My dear AstoriaAstoria dropped to the floor and she had her hands on her head. She felt herself screaming but was unable to feel herself.I am coming for you, my sweet Astoria"LEAVE MY HEAD" Astoria shouted.Harry was beside her and imploring her to stop screaming and asking her what the matter was.I shall see you soon, my darling. Then you shall meet your fate.Astoria felt her body being levitated and everything went black.A large room with a staircase. Many portraits hung on the wall. A bowl of lemons drops next to her."Miss. Greengrass are you feeling better?" A deep voice stated.Astoria heard an older mans voice hovering over her.She was laying on a long couch inside a large office.This was Dumbledore's office."I am sorry Professor I did not mean to bring her here. It was just your office was the closest place to levitate her to safety." Harry said in a shaky voice.Astoria was going in and out of consciousness."You did the right thing my boy. Now please. Leave us. I need to have a word with this young lady."She heard Harry descend the stairs and she tried to sit up."Drink this. It is a strengthening potion. You will feel better." Dumbledore said while handing her a vile.Astoria took the potion from the old man's hands and downed it. She instantly felt her head clear up and her body start to feel relieved from tension."Apologies, Professor. I suffer from intense migraine attacks. I am sorry to inconvenience you, I will show myself out." Astoria croaked out. After she downed the potion she attempted to leave the office."Miss. Greengrass during your attacks do you hear a voice inside your head?" The old man inquired lowly.Astoria turned around in astonishment. How did Dumbledore know about this? Did he read her mind when she was unconscious?"Uhm-Professor I-I think I- ""There is something different about you Astoria. Your parents are Thomas and Eloise, yes?" Dumbledore said while taking a seat across from her.Astoria nodded. Unamused. She did not feel like being interrogated."Miss. Greengrass, is this voice you hear a males voice?"Astoria nodded again but this time her facial expression turned almost frightened.Dumbledore sat in silence for a few moments, gathering his thoughts before she spoke. He gripped the side of his chair with his hand."Astoria have you been told the tale of the Dark Lord's unborn property?" He inquired lowly.Astoria shook her head. What did she know about the Dark Lord? She knew Harry had fought him several times in his life, but he was never strong enough to fully come back from the grave. His spirit always appeared in the form of another or a memory. So, what did this story have to do with Astoria? Astoria shook her head and was a little intrigued by what the story entailed."Almost twenty years ago Voldemort made a bargain with a young couple having their first baby. Due to health complications with the mother, the baby girl was going to be still born. The couple was devastated and considered all the options at hand to save their beloved child. Tom Riddle was summoned before them and he told them he would save their precious daughter, but at a price. She would live a long life, she would be beautiful, power, and smart, but she would be his property. Voldemort always wanted a female companion at his side, so he decided to secure one for life. After the war Voldemort disappeared before the baby was born, but the curse had already been done and the girl was a picture of health. Her whereabouts now are unknown, but it was said when he rose from his death, he would come for her. Claim what is his and what was promised to him."Astoria was waiting for the point where it involved her and in no way was this making sense to her. She just had migraine attacks. What was this old man trying to prevail to her?"Professor. What does this have to do with me?" She spat."Oh-nothing my dear. I just wanted to share this with you for some light story telling. Please run along. I am sure your friends are looking for you." Dumbledore muttered.Astoria left Dumbledore's office and headed back for her dorm room. Her head was throbbing in pain. She needed relief. Astoria decided to take a detour to Snape's potion closet. She knew where he kept the cranial pain relief potion. She peered around the corner to catch any sign of Snape or anyone else before entering.The coast was clear."Alohomora." Astoria whispered to the lock.With a short click the door flung open. She quickly shut it behind her and darted for the pain relief section. Astoria saw there were blood replenishing, menstrual and bone pain relief potions but she could not find the cranial relief potions."Miss. Greengrass." She heard from behind her."Shit."She thought to herself. She was caught and now she was going to either face expulsion for stealing or detention for rest of the term.Astoria did not know Snape very well, but she knew he was a stern professor."Professor Snape. I was- I was just- I-I am terribly sorry but please allow me to explain."Snape hovered over her holding the cranial relief potion in her face."I can presume it has been you who has been rummaging and swiping from my stores? I could have you expelled Miss. Greengrass." Snape said coldly.Astoria could not get expelled she had just started her journey at Hogwarts, and she was not ready to give it up. She made so many friends and bonds in England. If she got expelled, she could not go back to France because once a girl leaves the Beaxbaton Academy she cannot return."Please Sir. Lately, I have been suffering from intense migraines. To the point where I pass out and I wake up with throbbing pain. Madame Pomfrey tried giving me pain relief, but nothing worked until I found your cranial relief potion so I- '"You stole it." Snape interjected.Astoria nodded and put her head down in shame.She knew was about to become expelled. Snape was not going to let a thief wander about Hogwarts."Miss. Greengrass normally the punishment for thievery is expulsion. However, I am aware of your condition. I will grant you permission to keep taking this potion whenever you are ill." Snape said slowly and coldy while clasping his hands.Astoria's head perked up. Her chest felt light and she could breathe easier. She could hardly believe what was happening. It seemed Snape was sympathizing with her."I will also advise you take this. Daily." He snapped.Snape handed Astoria a blue colored potion with no name."Sir, what is this for?" She inquired."It will... help suppress the migraines. You will find it works exceptionally well, but only if it is administered daily. I would advise you not forget it otherwise your... migraines will return more frequently than you expect."Astoria took both potions from Snape. She nodded at him and thanked him for the gifts.Why would Snape want to help Astoria? He barely knew her. She found it slightly troubling, but it was quickly put out of her mind when she downed the cranial relief potion.The throbbing pain in her skull immediately subsided.Astoria was beginning to walk out of Snape's potion closet."Miss. Greengrass. Have you been trained in occlumency?" Snape inquired.Astoria shook her head slightly."Never trained but I have the ability to organize my mind and push important memories to the back if needed be. However, I am told I have a gift for legiliemency." Astoria said proudly.Snape paused for a few moments. He just stared at Astoria a few moments."I would suggest training in the craft of occlumency. If you need a master instructor, I am happy to supply one for you."Astoria thought about Snape's offer. It would be another skill she would have and she was always fascinated by occlumency. She could master her emotions and the memories people would see when they would dive into her mind.Astoria wanted to learn. She wanted to be the master of her own mind and control it at will."That would be most helpful Sir. Thank you I appreciate it. Which professor would be my instructor?"Snape shook his head."Not a professor. An excellent student of mine has just mastered occlumency. They will be teaching you how to control it and how to structure your mind like a filing cabinet. I am quite pleased with their abilities and I am sure they will be more than happy to share their wisdom with you."Astoria was quite excited. A student she could open to and explain everything she was feeling and how thrilled she was to be learning from an occlumency master."Brilliant. When shall I expect to meet them for our first lesson?" She said perkily."I will send you a message with a date and time of the first lesson. Expect it to be within a day or two."Astoria nodded and thanked Snape for everything he has done for her. She never expected him to be so nice to her. She wondered if Snape favored her over the other students for some reason. Maybe he thought she was pleasant to look at. Whatever the reason maybe she was thrilled to be putting her skills to the test and learning new skills.The next day Professor Snape sent word for Astoria to meet her student instructor in his office for an introductory session. So that instructor and student could meet and plan an itinerary for what was important for her occlumency lessons.Astoria slipped on a Slytherin crewneck, with some ripped jeans and a pair of black combat boots. She figured since it was not class hours anymore she would not have to appear in her robes.She opened the door to Snape's office to find Snape at his desk and a boy with platinum blond hair sitting on the other side of it.It was Malfoy.Astoria rolled her eyes and thought "of course."She had half a mind to walk the other way. She did not know where she stood with Malfoy. Were they friends? Did she dislike him? Did he dislike her? Their relationship was anything but solid at this moment."Miss. Greengrass. Please have a seat. I presume you know Mr. Malfoy."Astoria took a seat next to Malfoy."Hello Greengrass." Malfoy said coldly followed by a smirk."Malfoy." Astoria said while not making eye contact."Now I do not know the history between you... and nor do I care or is it relevant to this assignment. Malfoy, you are to teach Miss. Greengrass everything there is to occlumency. Miss. Greengrass, you are to follow Mr. Malfoy's instructions as he presents them. No exceptions." Snape said sternly and with intent.Astoria was more than frustrated with the situation. Not only were her and Malfoy barely speaking, now she had to take marching orders from him during their lessons."Do not worry Greengrass. When I am done with you no one will get into your pretty little head and read all your dirty thoughts." Malfoy sneered."Draco that is- "Snape started to say."Do not forget Malfoy I am a skilled legilimens. I can dive into your blond head anytime I want and see all your dirty daydreams you have. Watch it."Malfoy was beginning to say something when Snape hit him on the head with a notebook and told him to act professional.These two were acting like children and if Astoria wanted to master occlumency she was going to have to learn from a master.He was just not the master she was expecting.
  
    Chapter Text
    1995Malfoy and Astoria decided on when they would be practicing her lessons, they would do it after sunset in the courtyard. Close enough to the castle for safety but far enough so they would not draw attention. Snape gave them special permission to leave the castle after dark so they would be left alone during her practice.Astoria did not want anyone to know why she was spending time with Malfoy after nightfall. It might bring up some false accusations and she did not have the heart to tell Pansy how much time she was going to spending with the man with whom she fancied. Astoria felt it was best to "lay low."Malfoy decided for the first few weeks they would have three lessons a week to build up her skills and mental strength. In the process she would also be practicing her legilimency.A few days after the meeting in Snape's office it was time for her first lesson. Astoria glanced at her watch and noticed it was almost seven o'clock. She threw on a black shirt, followed by a plaid blazer and jeans. Her hair was up in a ponytail and she put on some perfume."Do we have a date?" Pansy asked as she walked out of the dorm bathroom with hair wet and wrapped in an emerald green towel.Astoria had to think of an excuse Pansy would buy so she would not ask many questions."I am just going to smoke some grass with Lilla for a while. She has had a rough time with one of her professors, so she needs some relaxation. I got some weed from when we went to London. I will not be gone more than two hours. Don't wait up for me."Pansy told her to have fun and casually dismissed the conversation. She proceeded to enter back into the bathroom to blow-dry her wet hair.Astoria felt awful lying to one of her best friends, but she did not have the heart to tell her the truth. She knew if Pansy found out she was training with Malfoy she would presume to think Astoria and he were dating. It would crush Pansy.Astoria made her way outside into the courtyard. The wards that covered the castle at night let her pass through, per Snape's prior approval. It was an empowering feeling to break the rules but with permission.Astoria looked all around for the blond but he had not arrived yet. Since he was tardy she decided to have a quick smoke. His fault for not being on time, plus Astoria's nerves were jumping through her skin. A relaxation cigarette was much needed.After about three drags she heard footsteps behind her. She gently reached for her wand and pointed it behind her.It was Malfoy."Whoa. Watch it feisty. It's just me." Malfoy said while throwing his hands in the air by his chest in surrender."My bad. I'm just a tad jumpy." Astoria said while putting the cigarette back between her lips."Well. This is not helping you." Malfoy yanked the cigarette from her lips and stomped on it."Merlin. Does everyone in England have a rod up their ass about cigarettes?" Astoria said while rolling her eyes.Everyone she met at Hogwarts, except Pansy, had negative opinions about her smoking. She knew it was not the healthiest habit in the world, but she was a witch. She could easily cure herself if she developed a disease, but she dismissed Malfoy's actions."I want you to show me how skilled you are at occlumency. That way I know where to begin.""So, you're going to use legilimency to judge if I can sort through my memories properly? How will you know what is important to me and what is not?"Malfoy walked toward her, flicked his wand, and conjured a chair for her to sit on."The memories that are prominent will have a certain feel to them. This feeling is a strong urge to keep looking at it because you think of it constantly and its value. So, I will be able to easily see your skillset."Astoria nodded. She took a seat behind her and began to take breaths. She had to clear her mind as best she could and begin to rearrange her mind. Less prominent to prominent memories.Malfoy walked toward her and pointed his wand to Astoria's head and plunged inside her mind.Astoria felt everything he was doing. Malfoy was diving through her memories."Welcome to Beauxbaton Academy love." Madame Maxime said as she set her hands-on Astoria's shoulders."Bonjour, Madame Maxime. Thank you for accepting me."Malfoy watched the memory and plowed his way in deeper. He wanted to see if she were keeping more prominent memories somewhere where he could easily."I've never seen you here before. You must be one of those Beauxbaton Girls." Cedric smiled down at her."Yes I am. My name is Astoria." She looked up at him and smiled. He was very handsome, and she was happy this was happening."Alright, well, Ria, how about we grab another drink and go for a walk?"Malfoy kept watching this memory with intent and watched how the evening played out. He watched Astoria and Cedric's first kiss.When he plunged deeper, he found the memory of their "first time."He could feel Astoria beginning to fight for him to exit her mind. She fought hard but he was stronger at this type of magic than she was.He watched the entire memory and left her mind."You bastard." She spat.Malfoy rolled his eyes and put his wand away."I am impressed you were able to try and force me from your mind. However, you were not successful I am subsided on my own. It is obvious you are keeping mere memories at the front and trying to push intimate memories to the back. You need more practice on how to make it less obvious. You also need to work on your emotion."Astoria furrowed her brows and crossed her legs. Putting her hands over her knees."And just how do I handle my emotion? As you may have noticed I can be a rollercoaster of emotion at times and- ""Stop wearing your emotions on your sleeve and control your emotions."For the next several hours Malfoy trained her mind. She had to block him from his legilimency or attempt to. She had to learn to re-arrange her mind in a way that if she ever needed, she could lock up important memories and only access them with her own magic."Being a true occlumens means concealing your mind from the most powerful of legilimens. Now, if you can master both skills then your mind could potentially be impenetrable. However, a true master is not revealing they are a master of their skills. You must make your enemies believe your mind is helpless and so when they do perform legilimency on you, your mind reveals nothing important."Astoria nodded and agreed. Everything was making sense to her. All this valuable information and she wondered how Malfoy knew so much about the magic of the mind. Why did he have the need to become a master of occlumency?The most powerful occlumens can conceal their true emotions and intent. They did not wear their heart on their sleeves, and they were a master of emotional manipulation. She wondered if Malfoy concealed his true emotions. It would explain his pompous ass attitude that occurred almost daily."Okay. That all is viable information and I have written down notes so I can review and practice. Guess I'll see you in a few days Malfoy."Malfoy nodded. He proceeded to flick his wand and make the chair disappear."Greengrass."Astoria turned around and hummed."Never mind. I will send word when our next lesson will be."Astoria proceeded to turn back around and head back to her dorm. She was mentally and physically exhausted.The next morning, she downed the blue potion Snape gave her to administer every day and she set off to start her day of classes.She sat next to Blaise in charms class. She noticed his lip was still injured from the fight a week ago with Malfoy.Astoria still did not know the whole story behind the fight since the boys were tight lipped about it.She extended her apologies, but Blaise scoffed and took a seat somewhere else in the classroom. She felt horrible for having used him for her own desires, but she knew it would take time before he forgave her.When she was in the great hall reading her potions textbook her owl appeared in front of her with a letter.It was from her mother.Astoria had not heard from her mother since the term began so she was eager to know what the letter read.Astoria my darling daughter,We need you to come home sometime in the near future. Something has happened and we need to discuss some important matters. Do not tell your sister, for she is not involved, and we plan to keep it as such.Send word when your arrival will be.All my love always,MotherAstoria immediately wrote back and told her mother she will return home within a week for two days. Astoria had exams to take during this time and she could not miss those. She was an exceptional student and she wanted to keep it that way.Astoria wondered what her parents wanted to discuss with her. It sounded quite urgent and its frightened Astoria a tad. She was just hoping it was something silly and she could dismiss it.She missed her parents dearly. She was excited to see them within a week.Due to the weather becoming colder Malfoy decided that their occlumency lesson for the night would take place in the library in the restricted section.Yet another rule waivered by Professor Snape. No students were allowed in the restricted section unless accompanied by a staff member.Astoria and Draco could not practice in peace when other students were using the library to study so this the best option at the time.Sweat began to trail off Astoria's forehead. She was trying her hardest to keep her mind clear, but it was quite difficult when Draco was plunging his way in anytime, she faltered slightly."You need to focus Greengrass. You're making this too easy."Astoria rolled her eyes and laid her hand on her hand."Malfoy. I am trying here. My head is beginning to throb. We have been practicing for almost an hour. You think this is simple?"Astoria stood up and made her way over to the window. She glanced down at the courtyard and then up at the moon. Trying to find some peace of mind before their next trial run."I am going to give you a vision to think of. I thought you were more advanced in occlumency, but I guess not. Sit." Malfoy pointed at the chair in front of him."Now. I want you to think of a stone wall."Astoria furrowed her brows at him."I thought I was supposed to be organizing my mind?"Malfoy shook his head and sat back. "No. For now I want you to focus on a stone wall. Your only objective is to keep me from smashing it down."Astoria nodded and took three deep breaths.Malfoy dove straight into her mind. She could feel the power of his legilimency starting to break down the wall. A few minutes after the wall was shattered but he did not leave her mind immediately. He dove in."Fucking watch where you're going." Said the pale figure standing before her."Oh-sorr-wait what the hell did you just say to me?" Astoria said while staring up at the man before her.Draco watched the first memory she had of him and then he relinquished his magic from her."Lessons concluded. I will speak with Snape and set up lessons next week. Be on the look out for an owl with a schedule." Malfoy said while slinging a satchel over his shoulder.Astoria had to tell him she could not attend next weeks sessions due to her leaving Hogwarts to visit with her parents. She was worried he might get agitated since their lessons have only just begun and she was already taking time off."Oh-um. Malfoy. Next week I can't." She said in a low tone.Malfoy turned around and raised his eyebrows."And the reason is?""I have to visit with my parents. They recently wrote me told me they urgently request an audience with me. I will only be gone two days."Malfoy nodded."Fine. But I am going to give you a book on occlumency for you to read in your absence, and I expect you to practice."Astoria rolled her eyes and saluted him."Yes sir."He let out a quiet chuckle before leaving her sight.Before she knew a small smile grew on her face."I didn't know he could laugh." She quietly said to herself.She packed up her books, went outside for a quick night smoke and made her way back to her chambers.Astoria was yet again, mentally, and physically exhausted.As she entered the Slytherin common room she found Lilla on the floor, unconscious with a bottle of fire whiskey beside her.Astoria froze until she realized what was happening. She darted over to her best friend.
  
    Chapter Text
    1995She could feel her heartbeat in her throat. Her blood pressure shot up so high she could barely breathe. Astoria was holding Lilla in her arms.She was barely breathing. Lilla clutched a bottle of fire whiskey. Lilla was a small girl like Astoria. Merely only 5'3 and 108lbs. Astoria knew Lilla had a knack for heavy drinking, but she never drank into oblivion.Lilla please. Please wake up. Open your eyes.Astoria thought to herself. She could feel tears streaming down her face. Before she could look up, she saw a pair of pale hands reach for Lilla's body. It was Malfoy."What the bloody hell happened to her?" Draco waved his wand casting a common diagnostic spell over Lilla. Astoria's head was riddled with anxiety she forgot to do anything that would aid her friend. That made her heart sink.Astoria tried to open her mouth, but hiccups and breaths kept coming out of her.Breathe. In and Out. Deep Breaths."I-I am not sure. I just walked in and found her on the ground unconscious. Wha-what is g-go-going on! I can'-can't lose her!" Astoria whaled out while holding her friend's hand.Draco looked her in the eyes. "Your friend is going to be fine Greengrass. She has alcohol poisoning. A girl this small should really go easy on the fire whiskey. Not sure what the hell was going through her head." Draco waved his wand and conjured up a glass of water."Aquamenti" he muttered to himself a few times before Lilla swallowed two full glasses of water.Lilla finally spit up some the water and opened her eyes."What the f- what's going on?" Lilla said as she looked at Astoria then back at Draco."Oh Lilla!" Astoria threw her arms around her best friend. "I thought you were dead! I walked into the common room and found you on the ground! How much did you drink!?" Astoria said while snatching the bottle away from Lilla's hands.Lilla sighed and she sat up clutching her head in her hands."I did not drink too much. I...I... mixed some things together. I guess I went a little to far." Lilla said while lowering her head in shame.Malfoy scoffed. "You think?"Astoria smacked Malfoy's arm. "I am here for you Lilla. I will brew you a sobriety potion and you will be good as new. Let me help you back to your room."Lilla agreed and got herself up, but soon after she found herself running over to the nearest bin and vomiting.Malfoy looked at Lilla with disgust and took a seat on the nearest leather couch. He crossed his ankle over his knee and began pouring himself some fire whiskey.Astoria held Lilla's hair back while her friend vomited and when she finished, she rubbed her back in comfort.Lilla walked past Malfoy and paused. "Thanks for your help."Malfoy lifted his glass and muttered Cheers. Lilla rolled her eyes and made her way up the spiral staircase."Tori I really am fine. I can make my way up to bed. I am so so sorry I scared you. Let us talk more about this later. But please do not forget to brew a sobriety potion for me. I fear tomorrow I will wake up wanting to lunge myself out the window."Astoria hugged her friend goodnight and kissed her cheek.She could feel Malfoy's eyes watching her from a distance. Maybe she could join him for a night cap? Just one. To calm her nerves.She walked over to Malfoy and handed him a rocks glass."Whiskey. Neat."She plopped down on the other side of his couch and put her head in her hand."I cannot believe the night I have had. I am exhausted." Astoria said while massaging her temples.Malfoy handed her a whiskey neat. She took a sip out of it and it tasted smooth and oddly expensive. Not like the common whiskey that was stashed in the common room."Is this from your personal stash? Doesn't exactly taste like the stuff the students keep hidden around here."Malfoy took another sip from his glass and glanced over Astoria's way."It is. I only drink a few times a semester. When I am really tired of the cheap shit. I do not usually share."Astoria was surprised. Why was Malfoy sharing his expensive liquor?"Aww am I special?" Astoria said while letting out a small chuckle and nudged him playfully.Malfoy stayed silent."My goodness. Calm down. Do not be so uptight. I was only joking."Malfoy turned his body to face her."As your teacher, we do not joke with each other.""As your friend, I will joke with you all I want."Malfoy quirked his eyebrows and let out a soft laugh."We are not friends, Greengrass."She went silent for a few moments. She thought to herself, Then what the fuck are we? Merlin, I am tired of your games.Malfoy smiled. "I am not trying to play games." He said spitefully and smiled as he took another sip.Astoria's mouth opened and she nudged her arm again."Stay out of my head Malfoy! Merlin! We are not practicing right now. So unnecessary!" Astoria said in a surprised but playful way. She could feel the whiskey turning her mood into a giddy one.He let out another laugh. She had him laughing tonight. Odd for them."I can't help myself. Your mind is so easy to penetrate."Astoria's first thought was to make a dirty comment, but she was on a happy streak with Malfoy right now and she did not want to ruin it by a dirty comment. He was an aristocrat type, but so was she, she was just a little more a open-minded.Astoria held her empty glass to him."If you'll allow me. One more. Neat."Malfoy furrowed his brows and nodded. He took the glass from her hand and just swiftly touching her fingers. She slightly twitched. She had not touched him since London and even in London she had barely touched him.It is not like she was begging for his affections. She decided if Malfoy was to be her occlumens teacher then they needed to be friends. Astoria was going to do her best to get on Malfoy's good side and at least be better friends than they were.Up until this point there seemed to be unspoken tension. She did not know if it was merely sexual tension or something deeper. Obviously, they were attracted to one another, but it was not brought up in another context of acting upon it. Other than Malfoy telling her it could not happen. Why? Did he not fancy her sexually? Was Astoria not his type? She found it mind boggling.Malfoy handed her another drink, and they clinked their glasses. Cheers."You know. If you would not be such an egotistical prick all the time, we could be good friends." Astoria blurted out. She slightly felt bad for calling him a name, but he needed to hear it."Me? Egotistical? Not sure what you're talking about." He said sarcastically and took another swig."Greengrass. Do not try and analyze me. You will not find anything. I am not an open book. I am your instructor because Snape asked me too. Not because I offered. He said you needed it for the future of your safety, whatever that meant. Do not take my decent doings as a form of fondness of you."Astoria was fed up. She tried.She drank the last of the whiskey, slammed the glass down and stood on her feet."For Merlin's sake. You really are a prick. If you do not want to continue our lessons fucking tell me. Then I will never have to see you again. I will just be fucking steer clear of you. I am not sure what I did to you in the past for you to treat me like shit, but I do not care for it. Good fucking night Draco." Astoria said as she dashed for the spiral staircase. She felt her arm get pulled back."Astoria. I-I am not good. You do not understand anything. Take the knowledge I have to offer and steer clear of me." Malfoy said while still holding onto her arm. Their eyes were locked. Her elbow sleeve was in a firm grip.Astoria leaned in. Almost touching her face with his."You think you know everything about everyone? You do not. Now. Let. Me. Go." Astoria managed to break free from Malfoy's grip.She ran into her dorm room bathroom. She looked in the mirror and cried. She was confused. Why was her head spinning?Keep your fucking shit together, Astoria. She thought to herself.The relationship she had with Malfoy was beyond complicated at this point. They were not friends but teacher and student, but also fellow housemates. Complicated. She realized that was first time Malfoy had ever used her first name.She slipped on her night clothes and crawled into bed. She gripped her pillow and staired out onto the moon. She realized soon she was going to see her parents. She decided she would push Malfoy to the back of her mind and focus on her visit.Astoria was too young to be dealing with such problems. A visit with her family will cure all the clouds in her mind."Let me know if Mother and Father send me anything. I have been dying for some of mom's banana bread!" Daphne said while hugging her older sister."You know I will, but you should really be coming with me Daph. I am sure mother, and father miss you as well.""They did not call for me, they called for you. It must be important."The girls made it to the port key sent ahead by her parents to ensure a fast arrival.The portkey was their Grandmother's old tea kettle. Something kept in the family for sentimental reasons. Astoria used to drink tea with her grandmother at the kitchen counter and listen to the stories of how the world used to be in her grandmother's day.Astoria held onto the portkey and before she knew it, she fell in front of Greengrass Estate.Rose bushes and pine trees lined the long driveway leading to the front door. Astoria walked through the gates and strutted through the door.Before she could enter any further into the house she was greeted by her mother with a warm long embrace."My darling Astoria. I have missed you. You look tired my dear? Is Hogwarts working you too hard?" Eloise said while holding Astoria's face in her hands."No Mother, I enjoy all my classes. I have just been having some problems with Lilla. She is going through a rough time and sometimes I do not know how to comfort her.""Astoria. Lilla has a troubled life. I am sure her home life is no different. Be patient with her and love her for who she is. If she is ever harming herself, you make it your business to take care of her."The ladies looked down to a see a small house elf appear."Hello Mistress Toria. Lucy welcomes you home. Lucy prepared hot tea and biscuits and are in the sitting room."The tiny elf disappeared with a pop and the ladies made their way into the formal sitting room.When they entered the room, Astoria was greeted by her father. She noticed he also looked... tired. His eyes were sunken in and black circles covered his bottom eyes. He looked slightly thinner than the last time she had seen him. Maybe work was stressing him to the max."Ahh hello my daughter. You look as lovely as always. I hope you are having a better year at Hogwarts this year considering... last year."Astoria took a sip of her tea. She knew what her father meant. He was talking about Cedric. How she slept with him while he was involved with Daphne and then he was killed during the tournament. The subject still slightly bothered Astoria to discuss Cedric, but she would never admit it. She knew she would always have a soft spot in her heart for him.It was time for dinner and Astoria was finishing pinning back her hair. She decided to wear a little black dress with Maryjane heels. The Greengrass' were quite poised and enjoyed expressing old fashioned dining etiquette so dressing for dinner is always a requirement.Astoria was taking a sip of her wine when she noticed her mother distressed. She seemed nervous, stressed, uncomfortable. What could possibly be bothering her? Astoria also noticed her father drinking more than he usually does. He was downing his third whiskey and he was quite silent.Astoria broke the silence."So... why did you two call me here and interrupt my studies?" She said light heartedly.Eloise looked at Thomas and he just kept his head low.Eloise took Astoria's hand."My love." She took a deep breath. "We need to have an important conversation with you."Astoria stayed silent waiting for her mother to say what was so important. She was growing nervous.Eloise had her hand over her mouth, and she looked as if she could burst out into tears."Astoria. I am not sure if you know this or not, but our family is cursed with a blood malediction. It was difficult for your father and I to conceive children. When I was pregnant with you the healers told us, you were going to be born still-born." Eloise wiped the tears streaming down her cheeks. "We were devastated. Our beloved baby would be born cold. Your father found himself a wizard that told us he could save you with magic. We were going to do anything to save you. He told us if he was to save you then when you came of age you would belong to him."Eloise covered her face in shame. Astoria's mouth dropped open. She realized in that moment she was owned. She was property her parents sold off."Are you telling me you sold your child off as property to a total stranger!" Astoria shouted while rising from her chair in haste.Thomas finally broke his silence."Astoria he was not a stranger. After he saved you the wizard became very weak and when the attack of the Potter's happened, we assumed he died."Astoria was putting the pieces together. Dark wizard. Dark magic. The attack on the Potter's."Are you trying to tell me that Lord Voldemort is the one who ensured I would be born alive! You SOLD me to the DARK LORD!" Astoria fell against the wall. She was shaking uncontrollably. Her mind was thinking about so many things at once.Eloise rose from her chair and cradled her child."My darling girl. I am so sorry. It was not supposed to be this way.""But you said he's dead? Correct? So, it's all over?"Eloise looked at Thomas. He nodded to tell their daughter the shocking truth.She would never be free. Not when her master was still alive."Astoria. He is alive. We got notice of what happened in the Graveyard with Harry Potter. It was all true."She shut her eyes. Hoping to wake up from this nightmare."Mother. Father. How do you know all this? I am so confused."Astoria's father knelt before her and held out his left arm. There it was.His dark mark. Thomas was a death eater.Her whole world would change forever."You are still too young for all this. He will not call upon you yet. Not until the summer. We are all summoned to be at his council meetings the month of June. We had to tell you this now, so you have time to come to terms. We are sorry but we wanted to give you a chance at a life and...""LIFE!? Some fucking life DAD!" Astoria said as she shot up and ran outside.She clutched her necklace and all she wanted was Lilla. Her best friend.As she was strolling through the garden, she laid on the grass.She found herself thinking about Malfoy. Of all times to be thinking about pompous ass this was not a great time.She realized she wanted nothing more than to go back to her boring life in France and to re-do everything.

    1999A quiet crack and Astoria stood outside her master's headquarters. It was a grand estate owned by Antonin Dolohov.Here we go. She thought to herself.Astoria strutted through the halls of the mansion. The many portraits on the wall were whispering as she walked past."She's back." One elder man said in a portrait."The Dark Lord's golden property has blessed us with her presence." Another snippy elder portrait spit out.Astoria rolled her eyes, and she made her way into the library. She knew her master spent countless hours reading battle stories of the great leaders before him. Hitler. Genghis Khan. Mao Zeodong. Countless others. The Dark Lord pulled strategies or tactics from each of their war stories. In his image he would create a society based on blood-purity and wizarding strength.She approached the door and knocked quietly. She took a few deep breaths and felt her hands ball into fists and slowly release."Come in." The voice said distinctly.Astoria pushed her way and closed the door behind her slowly."You called for me?" Astoria said almost bored and making her way over to the table.Lord Voldemort was dressed in his usual black robes, face terrifyingly alien like and no shoes. She always wondered why he never wore shoes. Was it to be more grounded or was he against protective soles? Odd."Yes, my dear. Come." Voldemort waved his hand over to her and pointed to a seat next to him.She sat herself down and gave him an inquisitive facial expression. What could he possibly want at this moment? She was fulfilling her duty with the Malfoy's, even thought Draco was being distant. Then she  worried that her conversation with Lilla was exposed. Perhaps Voldemort knew Lilla shared concealed information regarding his plan to experiment on muggle-born witches and wizards. Now she feared for Lilla's safety."How can I be of service, my Lord?"Voldemort, still looking down at his book and waving his finger at the quick ink quill, began to speak. Plainly and slowly."My dear, Astoria. As you know your union with the Malfoy boy is crucial. I trust that Lucius and Narcissa are treating you with the utmost respect and grace?" Astoria shuddered slightly and adjusted her posture. Before she could respond he spoke again. He leaned in forward making extensive, blood curdling eye contact with her. "I would not my precious girl to be treated poorly. Especially by people who have once disappointed me in the past."Astoria knew Narcissa and Lucius were treating her with as much respect as they could. Except for Lucius' odd encounter with her in the hallway, but she shoved that to the back of her mind. Narcissa was one of the sweetest women she had ever met, but there was always a tenseness in the air. Narcissa knew the union between her son and Astoria was detrimental to not only her son's life, but to hers and Lucius'. Astoria always felt the tension in the air when she was with Narcissa. Perhaps the reality of the matter was Astoria was to be the new mistress of the Manor and Narcissa was displeased with being replaced.Astoria put her elbows on the table and leaned in."My lord. They treat me as they should. As their future daughter."A small smile came across Voldemort's face. He was pleased. Astoria was his treasure, the most precious thing he owned. Astoria was not fond of being thought of as property but after some mind training, she quickly came to realization that it was her life's path to serve her master.Voldemort quickly rose and strutted behind Astoria's chair. His hands were placed on her shoulders. He spoke quietly in her ear sending a slight shiver down Astoria's spine."You know without a union to a suitable servant of mine. You cannot have a seat at the high council's table." His mouth was speaking softy into her ear. She sat so still she could feel her heart beating. All she wanted to do was dart for the door. "And I need to have my precious girl." A short pause. "Seated next to me. As my loyal follower."He sat next to her, not breaking eye contact. His eyes burned through her. She felt her heart racing in discomfort and fear. At this moment she was glad she was highly skilled in occlumency.She leaned in and spoke softly."I will make sure my task is successful. By this time next year, I will be seated at the high council and you will have me as your most trusted advisor, my Lord."A smile grew on his face and she noticed his rotted teeth. His disgusting breath swept across her nose and she wanted to gag."I trust your relationship with dear Draco is becoming reconciled?"A mild pause occurred. Astoria's gaze faltered and she looked over at the scattered books on the floor.She was afraid to admit Draco was still not thrilled with the thought of the marriage. What if her master got angry with her? There is no telling what he would to Draco to make him comply. Astoria felt a knot in her gut thinking about Draco being tortured because of her."Draco and I are a perfect match my Lord. He treats me well and loves me dearly. Recently, he has come to remember the long-lost love he has for me. Such an elated time it has been." Liar.It was a lie. All of it. If not for her occlumency, Voldemort would see straight through her lie. Astoria kept her hands flat on her thighs and made sure to calm her breathing. Voldemort could easily tell a lie when someone shifted their mannerisms or breathing increased. She witnessed him crucio'ing many of his death eaters for lying to his face.Voldemort leaned in and carefully caressed a strand of Astoria's blond hair. His breathing slowed as he eyed her carefully. She could feel the sensation of her hair root being slightly pulled.He took a deep breath and let out a soft chuckle."Excellent." He murmured.Before he could say anything more a knock as at the door."Enter." Voldemort said abruptly.It was Dolohov."What is so detrimental Dolohov that you interrupt my meeting with my precious Astoria?" Voldemort snarked.Dolohov walked cautiously over to the table and placed a scroll in front of Voldemort."My lord. This has just arrived from our spy at St. Mungo's. There is a detailed report in the scroll. I think you will be quite pleased with this week notes and results." Dolohov said upliftingly and with confidence.Voldemort lifted his wand and muttered crucio.Astoria shuttered as she watched Dolohov fall to the floor in pain. She witnessed his strength wither away by the command of Voldemort's magic.Antonin was lying on his back in grief taking long deep breaths, recovering from the curse. Voldemort strutted over Dolohov and put his foot on his chest.He leaned in slightly over Antonin. "Never. Interrupt me when I am in the company of Miss. Greengrass." He lifted his foot of his chest and waved his wand, forcing Antonin to rise on command."Am I clear, Dolohov?" He muttered softy."Ye-yes. My Lord. Pl-Please accept my-my deepest apologies. It shall not happen again."With a flick of his wand Dolohov was dropped to the floor, heaving for breath.Voldemort waived his hand and sending Dolohov out of the room.Astoria stood still and not breaking eye contact with her master.He strutted back over to Astoria and stood behind her."I am going to let you return home now my beautiful rose." He placed his hand on her shoulder. Astoria shuttered slightly and wanted desperately to leave.All she wanted in this moment was Draco. All she could think about is how she felt in his arms all those years ago. When things were simpler. When Draco embraced her tightly and told her he would always protect her.Times were different now.Astoria was Voldemort's property. She knew her place in society. Astoria forced herself to feel numb inside. If she let anymore feelings in than she already had she would feel her heart strings pulling apart. One by one.She turned around and looked Voldemort in the eyes. "I leave you now my Lord. Call upon me again if you request my presence."Voldemort looked down at Astoria's neck and saw her necklace. Her collar to him. The emerald necklace she so cherished was tainted by dark magic. The only light magic stuck inside the necklace was a memory she buried deep inside. A memory she would never forget.Voldemort's hand lightly grasped the necklace around her neck and set it back on.She gave him a soft smile and muttered "My lord." And strode out of the room.When the door shut behind her, she ran to the nearest loo. She looked at herself in the mirror and she noticed her hand shaking on the sink. Her heart was racing. Her breathing was becoming hasten.Breathe in for five. Out for eight. She thought to herself.Often after meetings with the Dark Lord she would find herself becoming anxious so she would often be taking calming potions. Sadly, she did not have one on her.She heard a faint knock at the door."Tori? Are you in there?"It was the feminine, raspy voice of her dear friend, Lilla. Astoria swung open the door and embraced her tight."Are you okay? What is going on? Why are you here?" Lilla said while holding Astoria's face in her hands."I am fine. Master only requested my presence to ensure the transition at the Malfoy's is going smoothly. However- ""However, what?" Lilla said abruptly."He asked if Draco and I have reconciled our relationship."Lilla's eyes open wide and her brows began to furrow."And... what did you tell him?"Astoria only shook her head. Lilla pulled her in for a hug."Do not worry. Draco will come to his senses. He has to, he has no choice if he wants to protect that mudblood."Astoria still hugging her friend whispered into her ear."Lilla I am afraid for him. If the Dark Lord hurts her then Draco will be broken."Lilla pulled away from the hug and looked her in the eyes."Astoria. You never exactly told me what happened between those two?"Astoria eyes fluttered. She tried to recall exactly what she remembers, but she only remembers one memory of seeing them together. Then it is black."Lilla. I-I just know he loves her and not me. I saw them sixth year. It's the only memory I have of them being together, but everything in my body is telling me it is the mudblood and not me that he loves."Astoria felt confused slightly. She realized she had not given much thought to what she remembered about Draco and Hermione's romantic relationship. She had a faint memory of them snogging in the special place Draco and Astoria went to be alone.At an old oak tree at the Black Lake. Draco and Astoria would sit for hours in silence either reading or working on classwork. She enjoyed his presence. Astoria would feel his chest rise and fall with every breath. How on occasion his hand would switch when he was focusing. She would plant kisses on his hand and let him know she loves him. That she was his.Astoria tried to focus all her might onto more memories of Draco and Hermione, but she felt as if she hit a brick wall.Was there something wrong with her memories?Had occlumency locked her out of her own mind?Astoria gave Lilla one last hug before apparating back to the Manor.She made her way back inside to the foyer. She heard Narcissa in the kitchen making tea and Draco was somewhere else in the house.She quietly made her way up to her room and shut the door.Astoria drew herself a bath and with a flick of her wand, casted an infinite warming charm on the water.Sitting in the water helped ease her nerves and calmed her mind of restless thoughts.Astoria dipped into the water and took deep breaths in and out. She reached up to massage her neck and noticed her necklace chain.She decided she wanted to watch the memory that was stored inside the emerald.Astoria clenched the jewel and muttered the spell, memorada.The memory appeared in her eyes as if she were there, reliving the moment.Draco's hand was placed on Astoria's cheek. His thumb massaging her jawline and cheekbone. A smile was plastered onto her face."Tell me you'll love me forever." Astoria murmured.Draco leaned in and kissed her lips passionately. His lips tasted like mint and his cologne filled her nostrils."Astoria Greengrass. I love you immensely. You are everything to me. You are mine." Draco never left her eyes."... and you are mine. Draco Malfoy." Astoria wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him in for a long kiss and a tight embrace.She could feel his hands on her waist, pulling her in. Desiring her. Loving her."Always." Astoria said softy between kisses."Always. Astoria." Draco replied, deepening the kiss.Astoria re-opened her eyes to reality, and she felt her eyes filled with tears. "Always. Astoria." She repeated to herself and wiped the tears from her eyes.She drained the tub, cast a drying charm on herself and slipped into a black nightgown. When she crawled into bed, she decided she was still to anxious to sleep.Astoria pulled the book Love Story from her nightstand and begun to read.After some time, she heard a faint knock at her door. She glanced at the clock and noticed it was past midnight. She rose from her bed and walked lazily over to her door.She opened it and there he was.Draco Malfoy. At her door.She smelled the fire whiskey in seconds."Draco? What are you doing here? It's past midnight." Astoria said while placing her arm on the door and furrowing her brows.Draco was silent for a few minutes."Okay... if you are just going to stand there all night... I am going to bed- "Draco stopped the door with his foot and pushed his way in."Draco. What are you doing?"He kept walking toward her and Astoria found herself faltering back. She was not sure what his intentions were.Did he want to yell at her?What was he playing at?"Oh. Oh. Astoria. Slytherin's princess." Draco managed to spit out without fumbling on his words.Slytherin princess? Astoria hardly thought of herself as a princess. She was popular amongst the Slytherin's but once her ownership with the Dark Lord was announced many people distanced herself from her. She lost many friends who were not on the side of the Dark Lord."Draco you are drunk. Let us get you back to bed- "Before she knew it, Draco pushed her against the wall and just started staring at her. Her heart began to race. She had to cast out her feelings. Let the numbness takeover her.His eyes were locked on her."Get the fuck off me you- "His hand went over her mouth."You don't have any id-idea Astoria." He put his hand on her shoulder.She stood silent for mere seconds before she felt the urge to embrace him.He was shaking. She felt conflicted, but she held him. Let him have this moment of weakness.She would have her answers in the morning, but for now. She was elated to be touching the man she loved again.

    1996Everything feels still. Everything looks the same but doesn't. The castle is still the castle. Her bed is still her bed. The soft feeling of the green sheets against her hands. Astoria's eyes flit open to find a familiar sight.Pansy. Pany Parkinson. Her roommate and one of her dearest friends. Sound asleep, whispering sweet nothings in her slumber.Astoria rolls to the side of her bed and notices her clock. It is nearly 4:30AM.She tries to roll back over to find a comfortable sleeping spot, but she is kept awake by her feet not being able to keep still. The feeling of anxiety is consuming her.Astoria throws the blanket off and puts on a green Slytherin jumper. She decided she needs a quick smoke to calm her nerves, and if she still cannot sleep, she will watch the sunrise of the black lake.A few soundless steps throughout the castle and out of the dungeons she finds a comfy spot next to a large oak tree overlooking the water.She takes a seat in the cold grass and utilizes her breath in the cold air. She is freezing but in this point in time she does not care.Astoria pulls a cigarette from her pocket and mutters the charm, incendio. A little flame lights the bud, and she inhales deeply. Astoria begins to see the sun peaking through over the water.She is realizing her life will never been as it was. She had so many dreams for herself. To go to Italy and study art. Watch how art in Italy differed from France. To examine the Mona Lisa. To stare at her and wonder why she is smiling.Is Mona Lisa happy with her life?Did she accomplish all she desired?Did she have a master as well?Mona Lisa had a master, except her master was her creator. Astoria seemed to realize she could relate herself with Mona Lisa. Created by man, gawked at for the world to see, sold, and moved around as the world pleased. Except Astoria was not a speechless painting. She was a human being, but she was being taken away by the man who allowed her to live past birth.Astoria lied on her back, looking up at the large oak tree.She felt cold tears streaming down her cheeks. A sniffle or two left her nostrils."What is my life now?" She whispered to herself.She wondered if anyone would answer. She was hoping someone would scream from above her and tell her she always has a choice when it comes to her life's journey.Except it was not only Astoria's journey anymore. It was much bigger than that.She held the emerald necklace in her palm. Her most prized possession.Soon she felt herself drifting into slumber due to mental exhaustion.If only she could rest peacefully and not have constant worr-"Greengrass?""Wake the hell up. It is nearly ten o'clock."She felt someone knock the bottom of her shoes. Her eyes sprung open to find Malfoy. Why was he at the black lake? Out for a morning stroll?He was dressed in his robes, with a satchel strapped to his shoulder. He must have been walking to a class that involved studying the merpeople in the black lake.It would explain his arrival.She hummed silently until she sat up and she realized she was freezing. Her hands were slightly discolored."Malfoy? Sorry. I must have dazed." Astoria grabbed her wand and casted a healing charm over herself. She felt instantly warm, but not warm enough to thaw the ice she felt inside."Just get the fuck up. You are going to freeze to death. I do not need you dying before we practice later. An important lesson I have for you." Draco said as he made his way across the grass.Astoria began to wave slightly but stopped herself out of embarrassment."Right! Ah-um. See you tonight!" She said loudly.She glanced at her watch and realized she was late for potions.Bollocks. She casted her Slytherin robes on and sprinted to the classroom.Meet me in the library. Restricted Section.D.M.Astoria found the note under her door when she returned from dinner. Thankfully Pansy was too busy with Blaise to go back to the dorms with her.Astoria found herself slightly nervous about this lesson with Malfoy."Professor Snape. I cannot. I do not know what to do. Please. I know you know the truth about who I am. What do I do?" She paused catching a breath and a realization appeared on her face. "Oh- my – Merlin, Draco! When we practice occlumency he is going to see the encounter with my parents! He will know the truth- oh my- my lord."Snape walked over to her and sat across from her. "Miss. Greengrass. Please compose yourself. Mr. Malfoy will not discover your secret because I will ensure it as such."Astoria sat there confused. What was he going to do to her? Obliviate her? Make her drink a horrid tasting position to keep her calm?"I am going to push that certain memory away inside your head. Only you and I will be able to access it but only you will be able to unlock it, if you ever wish too."Astoria sat and pondered all the pros and cons quietly. After a few minutes of silence, she nodded cautiously. She sat back in her chair, gripping the arms, and bracing herself for mental impact."Legilimens!" Snape said sternly while pointing his wand at Astoria's head.Snape effortlessly plucked the memory from Astoria and hid it behind a magical wall. Malfoy would not see it unless Astoria tore it down herself.Astoria tore herself away from the mirror and was relieved by what Snape had done to her memory. She was not ready for Malfoy to discover her secret. Hopefully, he would never. If he were smart, he would keep his nose in his books and out of light versus dark magic. Draco Malfoy is smart. One of the brightest wizards his age.She glanced over at her clock and noticed it was nearly nine at night. Pansy still had not returned from dinner. Very strange, but Pansy is a free spirit so there is not telling what she is up to these days.Astoria put on a pair of dress pants, a plaid blazer, followed by a black turtleneck underneath. She slipped on her tan colored flats and scurried through the dungeons.She heard the hustle and bustle of several students making their way to the Slytherin common room, but Astoria kept her head low. Trying not to raise questions on where she is going and why.The lessons were kept under the radar even after a few months.Astoria strutted into the library's restricted section to find him there, reading a book, looking good as always."Hi." She muttered under her breath."Evening." He did not look up. "Sit." He pointed to the chair next to him.She obeyed and waited for his next command."It is time I taught you something about memories. How to conceal, re-play and reinvent them."Astoria quirked an eyebrow. Wizards were able to reinvent memories. She was unaware memories could be tampered with among magical people. Muggle memories were easy to manipulate but you rarely hear of a witch's memory being tampered with."Reinvent? As in tamper with?"He nodded. "Precisely."Astoria fixed her posture and was ready to intake any information Malfoy was willing to relay. She was often surprised how much knowledge he had regarding legilimency and occlumency."Now I want you to think of a dark memory. Something tragic. Something that makes your soul ache when you think of it."Astoria closed her eyes and when she opened them, she was in the hospital wing. In her bed, recovering from her migraine attack.She envisioned someone running in and yelling about how Cedric died in the maze. She felt heartbreak all over again.But before she knew it the memory began to shift. Her heart began to lift. When the memory played back, she was asleep in her bed, and she was holding a photograph. The photograph displayed a picture of Cedric Diggory and Harry Potter holding the Triwizard Cup. Both boys smiling in joy and in their shared victory.Astoria re-opened her eyes and found her cheeks wet."What was that?" She said shakily."I just manipulated that memory." Malfoy said subtly.Malfoy flicked his wand and Astoria's head instantly flew back. The memory of the someone bursting in announcing Cedric's death came across her eyes.She felt her heart break again. She was never in love with Cedric, but she never wanted him to die. He was her first. The first man to touch her passionately. Cedric Diggory will always hold a special place in her heart.When the spell was complete Astoria was out of breath and she could feel her head spinning.Malfoy tried to look Astoria in the eyes, but she had them closed tightly. She kept her hands behind her head, trying to compose herself.It was all too real. Reliving memories is too painful. Malfoy placed his hand on Astoria knee."Are you alright?" He said lowly.Silence. Pure silence for merely two minutes. She had to compose herself. Act professional, no matter how much her chest began to hurt."Quite." Astoria's head flew up and she ran her hands through her hair and turned around. "Shall we continue?"Malfoy seemed almost shocked of how fast she recovered.They practiced for several hours. He taught her how to take a memory and alter it. Although it could be a painful process for not only the person who holds the memory but for the wizard tampering with it.Malfoy taught Astoria how to alter her own memories if she wished it. He explained to her sometimes-painful memories keep us from fulfilling our tasks. Sometimes we need to alter them to keep our mind focused.After some time of Malfoy training Astoria with her own mind she had a thought."Might I practice a bit? On your mind?" She asked lightly.He scoffed and threw his hand in the air. "Fuck no."Astoria huffed. She needed practice if she was going to use this magic on someone else in the future. She needed Malfoy to be bold and allow her to stretch her legs at some new magic."Come now. Do not be such a stiff." She said as she sat in front of him and went to move a piece of hair out of his eyes.Malfoy instantly grabbed her wrist and yanked it out of his view."I said. Fuck no, Greengrass. You are not getting in my head." Malfoy began to pack up his books, quills, and essentials. Just before Astoria stood behind him and pointed her wand at his head.She needed practice. She needed a dummy. He was the only one there. Astoria had no choice.She muttered the spell, memorada.Malfoy instantly grabbed hold of his head and Astoria flew into his memories. It was as if she was walking through a long hallway with doors. Each door opening a new memory. Memories from his childhood, up until now.She felt something pushing her into one of the doors. She plowed her way in and witnessed his most painful memory.She witnessed Draco, what appeared to be his mother and father, in a formal sitting room."You keep away from my son, Lucius! Do you hear me!" As Narcissa stated Lucius' cane came over her head and she fell to the ground."NO! MOTHER!" Draco cried out in the corner of the room. Charging at his father.Lucius peered over at the ten-year old boy and raised his cane once more.However, he did not strike. Rather he kneeled over and got to his sons level."Now you will be quiet. If you speak another word, you will find the other end of my cane over your backside, my boy. Just as your mother has, many times before you."Astoria felt something push her out of the memory. She flung herself against the wall in terror and exhaustion. She was left speechless. Malfoy was sat in the chair filled with rage. His nostrils flared, his face beat red and his fits curling into fists.She has never seen such rage in a young man. Astoria began to open her mouth but all she could muster out was, "I-I am sorry. I need-needed- "Malfoy charged toward her and grabbed hold of her neck. Pinning her against the wall. Not saying anything. His grip tightening in her windpipe. She felt almost as if he was going to crush her. End it all. He got close to her face and began to breathe on her. She could smell the peppermint in his breath and the strong scent of his cologne."You little cunt. How fucking dare, you." He said lowly.Astoria kept her eyes on his. His hand still gripped around her throat. She tried to get him to loosen her grip to allow air flow, but it was like moving a bulldozer. Nothing would budge him."Malfoy-I-I am -sss-sorry. Pl-Please—" She managed to squeak out.A few moments later Malfoy loosened his grip but still had her pinned to the wall."You stay out of my damn head, Greengrass." He said and he let her go. She nearly fell to her knees her balance was off shift. She gasped for air the first chance she had."I am done teaching you." Malfoy said while attempting to walk out.Astoria ran over and gripped his forearm."No!" She said with intent."I cannot lose you now. I need to learn more than ever." She said almost pleading. She could not lose him. She felt too attached for all this to end. He was a great teacher and Astoria learned so much."You cannot be fucking trusted. All you think about is yourself. You are pathetic." He sneered in her face and yanked his arm free."Malfoy. Please." She breathed in trying not to tear. "I need you to forgive me please." She said standing very still.He stood in the doorway of the library. Not moving. She noticed his breathing slowing down. He was calming down. She felt horrible for invading such privacy. She did not know much about Malfoy, only that he is a skilled wizard and very private person.He turned around slowly. The rage in his face subsided but not his eyes. His eyes were dark and stormy. Filled with hate. Hate for Astoria in this moment."You want my help Greengrass?" He said sternly.She nodded hastily. He noticed the tears streaming down her cheeks. He walked over to her and hovered above her as she sat down slowly."Give me your necklace." He said with a cheeky tone.Astoria quirked and eyebrow and her hand instantly flew to her chain. This was her most prized possession."Why do you want my necklace?"He leaned over her and started to play with the jewel. She started to feel a shiver go down her spine as his fingers unintentionally touched the top of her chest."If you try to break into my mind again. I will take you by the hand. Lead you down to the black lake and throw this necklace where it will never be found."Her mouthed dropped open."Please. Malfoy. Not my necklace. It is a Greengrass heirloom and I cannot afford to lose it I- "Malfoy turned on his heel."You are untrustworthy. I will not continue training you until you hand it over."Astoria's eyes began to pool. She had an attachment to her emerald, but she needed Malfoy's lessons. She nodded slowly and he walked behind her.She took her hair from behind her head and wrapped it to the side. She could feel Malfoy's hands around the clasp of her necklace. After it was off, she could hear him putting it into his pocket. However, he did not move away from her right of way. She could feel his eyes burning through her skin. He was regarding her.Malfoy put his left hand on her shoulder and squeezed. Astoria's first instinct was to reach up with her right hand and grab his. He did not falter when she did. Rather he just stood still in the moment. She squeezes his middle and pointer finger together before turning around to face him.His eyes were looking down upon hers. Her eyes filled with tears. Her cheeks as red as a tomato. She gave him a weak smile.His expression remained blank and he looked down at her neck where her necklace was no more.Astoria's hand reached up to where it was and laid her hand flat and turned her head."I should go." He muttered breaking the gaze.Astoria walked with him to the dungeons to the Slytherin common room. As they were apart to depart to the dormitories, Astoria grabbed hold of Draco's hand. She was expecting him to snatch it away and call her a foul name, but he only appeared shocked."I really am sorry. About your father and invading your memories." She said while giving his hand a little squeeze but when she did, he ripped his hand away.He said nothing and went up the spiral staircase. She was yet again left alone. Except this time, she had herself to blame being so needy. Did she really need to practice memorada on Malfoy? She could have easily found a first-year dummy to practice on. Astoria felt her green satin bed sheets and finally got a decent night's sleep.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Astoria was walking through the long dark hallways of the castle. It felt like she was floating through them. No destination. No journey intended. She needed to clear her mind. She often found herself needing more of that lately. To be alone with her thoughts and not think too hard on her future. She had decided she would make the most out of her freedom while it lasted. Astoria knew the Dark Lord has not officially returned so there was a slight chance he died. Highly unlikely, but a young girl can dream of her own master's demise.Astoria was running her hand along the wall when suddenly the wall turned into a large door that reached the ceiling. She jumped back and was confused at what she had found.She pressed her hand up against the door to make sure she was not imagining it, and just then she heard commotion coming from the other side.It sounded like people dueling. Astoria pressed her ear up against the door to hear better before the door flew open and she hit the ground of the inside."Tori?" A familiar voice said as she was gathering herself up.It was Harry.She looked around and saw many Gryffindor students and some Ravenclaws. She noticed Ron, Hermione, and Luna. She did not know Luna well, but she was best friends with her sister."Harry? Ron? Hermione?" She peered around making eye contact with everyone and they all stared back at her with confusion."How did you manage to find us?" Hermione asked as she shoved her way to the front and in front of Astoria.Astoria did not know Hermione Granger well, but she knew this girl was a know-it-all. She had her most of her classes and sometimes she wanted to throw a silencio charm her way or chop her arm off if she raised it once more."Find you? I was not looking for you. Any of you in fact." She fixed her jumper and pulled down her skirt that rode up as she fell over.Ron approached Harry and grabbed hold of his arm."She cannot be in here Mate. She is a Slytherin. Slytherin's are not trustworthy." He then made eye contact with Astoria and gave her an apologetic look. "No offense, Tori.""We need to obliviate her." Hermione said abruptly.Just before Astoria could speak to ask more questions a familiar face came out from the shadows. It was her sister. Daphne."Astoria?" Daphne said in a low inquisitive tone. Daphne looked stunned to see her sister and happy. She had not seen her since before she left to visit with their parents."Daph? Wait. What the bloody hell is going on around here?"  Astoria said as she lunged herself forward and closing the large door behind her. She then crossed her arms and raised her eyebrows. She wanted answers. Why were they sneaking around in a musty old room? Why was the room hidden? Why did it sound like these students were dueling? During these times Umbridge had basically all dueling suspended."We CANNOT trust her!" Hermione said loudly."Hermione. Harry. Daph. I am trustworthy. I will not tell a soul what I saw here today but I only want to know what my sister is apart of. Do not be prejudice against Slytherin's. We are some of the most loyal people you will ever meet." Astoria said proudly. She was proud of her house. Astoria was cunning, loyal, ambitious, and looked fabulous in green. Harry stepped forward as well as Daphne. They looked Astoria in the eyes and began to speak."Astoria. This is a place where we go to learn how to defend ourselves in times of need. I am sure you remember the incident last year with... you know who." Daphne said lowly.Astoria knew Cedric was a touchy subject for her sister. As well as for her. But if she wanted to keep an honest, healthy relationship with Daphne she never brought him up. Cedric was Daphne's love, and she was going to let her have him. Even after his death."So... you all are just practicing spell work?" Astoria said while loosely adjusting her arms to a more relaxed position."Not exactly." Harry said cautiously. He leaned in closer to Astoria, almost as if he were muttering a secret."Well, you see, we are Dumbledore's- ""HARRY!" Hermione interjected and pulled his shoulder back."Granger would you please shut that oversized mouth of yours for one moment? Who am I going to tell? The Daily Prophet? Do I look like Rita Skeeter?" Astoria said sarcastically which led to the other students to laugh at her bluntness.Hermione was acting rude and unreasonable for interrupting Harry. Astoria got closer to Harry again and took his hand."Trust me, Harry. It is only me." Astoria said reassuringly while giving him a warm smile and he returned the gesture.Harry was one of her valued friends since he accompanied her to the Yule Ball. A night of glamour regret and a near death experience. A night of emotional torment more like, but she only likes to remember the glamourous details."We are Dumbledore's Army." Harry said flatly.Army? For what? War? What war? Did she miss the part in the paper where it mentioned a war broke out? What the bloody hell."Army?" Astoria said lowly.Daphne stepped in front to meet Astoria's eyes and she began to speak as if she was relaying a confession."Yes. We are a united group who is fighting against You Know Who."Astoria felt her heart sink. She knew who they were referring to, but they did not know her secret. No one does except for her parents. An idea sparked in Astoria's mind. If she joined the army of the resistance, then maybe the bond between her and the Dark Lord would sever. Astoria realized Harry has already defeated the dark lord three times in his life already, surely one day he will finish the job. She desperately wanted to be on the inside of this army. However, if she did join Dumbledore's Army then her fellow soldiers would be unaware that they are fighting alongside the one person who is supposed to be a true follow of the Dark Lord. Astoria weighed out the pros and cons in her mind before opening her mouth and speaking next. However, she blurted out, "I want to join" instead."Rubbish." Hermione said while crossing her arms and lunging forward."Are you mental?" Daphne said while tilting her head. "This could get you killed, Astoria!""Yes, Daph. I am aware. I want to fight for the cause. If it does come a time that we are forced to fight You Know Who then I also want to be ready. I also want to stand on the side of freedom and light." Astoria said proudly while scanning the room memorizing faces.Luna's face seemed amused, but it was difficult to ever get a read on that strange girl. Neville Longbottom looked scared and confused. Hermione was huffing and puffing as she always does when she does not get her way. Ron kept his eyes on Harry hoping he would not have to contribute to the decision of letting Astoria join. Lastly, she saw Daphne's face. Hopeless and worried. Astoria also wanted to join to keep Daphne safe. She was her sister and what kind of family would she be if she did not protect her own blood.Harry kept his head low and was searching for an answer."Give us a minute Tori. We need to discuss this together." Astoria nodded and walked to the end of the room to give them privacy.She could quietly hear Granger's big mouth, "She is not to be trusted. She is a Slytherin. All Slytherin's are loyal to HIM." Astoria rolled her eyes and folded her arms and muttered the word prejudice under her breath. Ironically enough when she did Granger's eyes found hers and Astoria shot her a snarky smile.After about ten minutes of discussion the group concluded. They made their way over to Astoria and she clasped her hands properly. She was slightly nervous at what their verdict would be. They had every right to cast her out and obliviate her. She would not know the difference. She would just go back to halls and drift through them mindlessly."We would like for you to join us. Perhaps you can change some of ours minds about loyalty among Slytherin's." Harry said while pulling her in for a hug and shooting her a cheerful smile.Astoria, still hugging Harry said to him. "You know I will. You can trust me with anything.""Thank you everyone. You will not regret this." Astoria said elatedly."We'd better not or our blood will be on your hands." Granger said in her face.Astoria desperately wanted to call her a mudblood but she held back. She was accepted in their resistance. She had a real fighting shot of changing her life path now. A group to fight for her life and the life of the wizarding world. She knew soldiers never left other soldiers out in the field to die. Astoria has read many soldier memoirs from the muggle World Wars and all of them mention the soldiers never leaving their men on the grounds to die along. Astoria desperately wanted people to be there for her. Fight for her.Astoria decided to break the slight tension in the air. "So... I heard you guys dueling when I... dropped in." She added a slight chuckle, as did others. "What were you all practicing?" She asked as she reached for her wand in her waistband."Harry was teaching us the spell Stupefy." Ron said warmly."It means to stun your opponent. Stunning them is like knocking them out for a few minutes to fix your position or finish them off completely." Harry said lowly, not wanting to continue and explain what "completely" meant. She knew.Harry decided that the dueling would commence once again. He quickly showed Astoria the wand movements. Which was simply point your wand at your opponent and sternly cast the spell. Harry paired her up with Hermione. Lovely. She knew this was going to end with her head getting bashed against a wall.The girls took their stance opposite of one another. Hermione had a scowl that could kill, and Astoria looked at her almost mockingly, signaling for her to begin.Astoria did not even mutter the spell and a red spark shot out of her wand and hit Hermione in the shoulder, forcing her to lose balance. The whole crowd broke out in shock and little chatter. "'Mione has never lost a duel." "Who is the girl?" "Astoria's got some power to her." "Wicked."Astoria strutted back to the crowed feeling accomplished and she noticed Harry's look of astonishment. Then noticed Hermione's raged filled face and eyes. If she did not know any better Granger wanted to send a threatful hex right in Astoria's direction. But dueling meant anyone can win. Even the person who is least expected too.Harry steps to the front of the crowd. "Thank you all for being here today. You all did great. Welcome Tori to the fight and we are lucky to have you here." He sent her a warm smile. She could always count on Harry to make her feel accepted.As everyone left Astoria made her way over to the large mirror and noticed a few pictures stuck to the glass. A group picture of some adults. To her surprise she sees a picture of Cedric. Smiling. Looking as if he has the world at his fingertips. She finds herself smiling at her when she hears footsteps come up behind her."You miss him?" Harry said as he looked at the photo with her.Astoria nodded slowly and lightly touched the photograph. "I do. He was always fun to talk to, and even more fun for the occasional snog." She nudged Harry's arm playfully and he let out a soft chuckle.Harry stood still facing forward but seemed to tense up. "I am really happy you found us Tori. Defense is very important to keep yourself safe." He said warmly.She began to face him. "I really have you to thank. Without you Hermione would have obliviated me and knocked me on my arse in the hallway before I even had the chance to get up."He let out a soft laugh, but he knew she was right. Hermione will always have it out for her, due to her prejudice against Slytherin's. But Harry was more open-minded and saw the good in everyone. Especially Astoria."I am happy you're here Tori." He said attempting to grasp her hand, but she broke the contact."Thank you. I am too." She spoke.Before she knew Harry was trying to lean in to kiss her, but she quickly stopped him. She only saw him as a friend, but she had no idea he fancied her. Kissing Harry would be as if kissing a brother. A member of her family. It just is not done."I am sorry Harry but, I cannot." Astoria said while facing to the side in slight embarrassment.Harry put his hand behind his hand and scratched his neck. A nervous tick it seemed like."It's Malfoy isn't it?" He said bluntly.Malfoy? Since when did he get brought up? They were not a couple. In fact they were hardly seen together anywhere, except for classes. The only time anyone saw her around Malfoy outside studies, was in the Slytherin common room with everyone. Unless Harry knew about Malfoy's lessons in occlumency. Then she began to worry. He found out. He knows she is studying to strengthen her mind. He will deem her untrustworthy."Malfoy? What are you talking about we are not- "?Harry interjects sharply. "He watches you like a hawk. Everywhere you are his eyes are on you."Astoria looked down for a moment. How had she not noticed. She usually notices when someone is staring at her or analyzing her. How did Malfoy slip through those cracks?"Harry, I do apologize but I think you are mistaken. Malfoy does not watch me. I am nothing to him. I am pretty sure he despises me as much as Granger does believe it or not. Maybe even a little more." She said while running her hand through her hair nervously and biting her lip.Harry leaned in and gave her a reassuring smile. "Tori. You better bloody believe that man watches you. Like you're a fragile vase sitting on a ledge about to be tipped over and he is ready to catch you when you fall."Astoria was still in disbelief. She could not believe her ears. How could she not notice? Was Malfoy deliberately treating her rude to protect her or himself? Was he afraid of letting people in? That part was surely true after the memorada spell incident. She knew if he were to ever let her get close again it would be with a six-foot pole.Astoria leaned into hug Harry tightly in comfort. She did not want to hurt his feelings. She gave him one last reassuring smile and started to take her exit until he interjected."Hey. Um. I am sorry about the-the kiss thing. I do not know what came over me." Harry said in embarrassment as his cheeks turned a slight pink color.Astoria squeezed his shoulder, leaned in, and left a soft peck on his cheek. To let him know she forgave him, and she loved him dearly as a friend.

    1996"Stupey!""Bombarda!""Expelliarmus!"The dummy flitted from person to person. Hovering over the floor. Finally, the dummy made its way over to Astoria."Confringo!" The dummy rose before her and slightly began to crumble. The crowd went silent.Astoria imagined it was him. Her master coming for her. To steal her away from the people she loved. The life she built for herself. It was bottled and she released some of the anger onto this dummy.Her shoulders shuddered slightly at the sudden release of powerful magic. She slowly lowered her wand and scanned the room.All eyes were on her. Some astonished. Some looking at one another with bewildering facial expressions. No one in this room, except for Daphne, had seen her use her magic. All the students here were Gryffindors, with a handful of Ravenclaws. No other Slytherin's and no Hufflepuff's."Fantastic. Absolutely brilliant, Tori." Harry said while taking his stance over the demolished dummy."Now that we are all warmed up. It is time for us to start an advanced lesson. This spell will allow you to ward off Dementors and allow you to conjure a patronus. Your patronus will take the shape of an animal. Now, to conjure a patronus charm you must think of a memory. An exceedingly happy memory. A memory that fills your body with joy." Harry began to raise his wand and conjure his patronus."Expecto Patronum!"Harry's patronus was a stag. It was a large white animal that shimmered among the dim lights of the room.After mere moments, the patronus vanished."Now. I want you all to think of your memory and when you are ready cast your own patronus. Do not fret if you cannot conjure one on the first try, this is really advanced stuff."Astoria walked over to a corner and shut her eyes tight. What would she think of? Cedric? No, too heartbreaking due to his demise. When she first arrived to the Beauxbaton academy? No, she was crying the first week she was there.Think. Think. Happy thoughts. What makes Astoria Greengrass happy? Not much these days except for a good cigarette. Then it hit her like a shot of fire whiskey.Astoria closed her eyes and muttered, "Expecto Patronum!"After a few mere moments. Nothing. No white cast. No white vapor of an animal appeared from her wand.Astoria closed her eyes once more and imagined the memory. It was as if she was there. She could feel the memory. Smell the air."EXPECTO PATRONUM!" She yelled at in angst.Nothing.She threw her back against the wall in anger. She looked around the room and saw everyone else conjure their patronus. Luna conjured a bunny, Granger had an otter, Ron had a small dog, like a Jack Russell.She huffed in frustration. Maybe she was not happy enough to cast a spell that needed so much light. Darkness filled her every thought. She started to draw more into herself before a small hand touched hers.It was Daphne."Come on. Together." Daphne guided Astoria's wand up high and gave her a soft smile. She missed this. Missed her sister being by her side.Astoria returned the smile and nodded faintly.She took a deep breath in and muttered the spell.A few seconds of waiting and nothing appeared. The look of disappoint on Astoria's face was prominent because Daphne pulled her in for a long embrace. She felt defeated. She felt weak. She felt unhappy.Weak.Defeated.Useless.Property.Darkness.Astoria shook her head and lunged herself from Daphne. She ran out the door with tears in her eyes."Tori!""Greengrass! Wait!"She heard the other students calling her out, but she ignored them. She ran out to the Black Lake and watched the ice crack along the water. It was freezing outside but lately; she enjoyed the feeling of numbness. No pain. No worry. Just frozen in time.After minutes of shivering, she decided to conjure herself a cloak. The cloak was black but had an infinite healing charm casted over it.She reached into the pocket and pulled out a cigarette. A much needed drag. She muttered the spell Incendio and lit the bud. She tilted her head back against the oak tree and tasted tobacco between her lips.She heard footsteps coming toward her. Small ones. Astoria began to reach for her wand until she heard a female's voice."Greengrass? May I have a word?" Granger said with a subtle tone.What the fuck is she doing here? She does not even like Astoria, why must she bother her while she is gathering her thoughts.Astoria barely turned around to make eye contact with her and just waived her hand for her to come over. Granger conjured a blanket and sat on it facing her. Astoria making eye contact with her, continued to take puffs of her cigarette, and blowing the smoke in her face."What is it Granger? I am busy doing bad Slytherin things over here." She said with a sarcastic tone.Granger let out a huff and turned her head toward the lake. After a few moments she began to speak."I saw you have trouble casting your patronus. I have done enough reading to know that when a witch or wizard cannot conjure a patronus it is because..." She hesitated lightly. "Because they do not have a strong enough happy memory for the patronus to live." Granger said while lowering her head in shame.What was she trying to tell her? That she had a miserable life, and she has no unhappy memories? That she is just another aristocratic Slytherin bitch that is depressed and alone?Astoria flicked the cigarette from her hand, and it landed just in front of Granger's boots. She gave Granger a smirk and began to gather herself up."Thanks for the tip." Astoria said while making her exit."Wait." Granger said while grabbing hold of her arm.Astoria turned around and her expression was bored. She was done with this conversation."Hermione. I will figure this out on my own I just nee- ""Astoria." Hermione interjected. "Listen to me. You can conjure one. You just need to create a happy memory."Astoria nodded and her expression told Granger to move forward with the presentation. Her arms folded at her chest and her stance grounded.Maybe Granger had a point. If she did not have a happy memory on hand strong enough to conjure a patronus, why not create one?"I will keep that in mind." Astoria said while making her way back up to the castle.Pansy bursted into the dorm rooms like she was shot out of a canon. She ran over to Astoria's bed, her cheeks red, her breathing heavy and a smile plastered on her face."TORI! Thank Merlin you are here! I have fabulous news." Pansy said excitedly.Astoria shot up from when she was lying down and faced her friend."Tell, tell!""I shagged Blaise. We are an 'item' as they called it in America!"Pansy looked unbelievably happy. It was time she had something else to focus on besides her family life and classes. Plus, Pansy would constantly jabber on about her sexual frustrations. Astoria was glad atleast someone was relieving her stress in that sense. Pansy deserved to be happy and Astoria had never seen her so happy. She never knew Pansy fancied Blaise. The subject may have been touchy since a few months ago Pansy nearly saw Blaise and Astoria snogging in the common room."I am elated for you!" She pulled her in for a tight embrace. She was deeply happy for her friend and Blaise."You're not... mad, are you? Things are not going to be weird... right?" Pansy said as she lowered her head awkwardly.Astoria blinked her eyes and could not believe her ears. She took Pansy's hands and gave them a slight squeeze of reassurance."Things are not weird. That thing between Blaise and I was just a one-time fiasco. Not to happen or mention again if you please." She said with a slight chuckle.To be frank, Astoria was embarrassed about the entire situation with Blaise. She hardly made eye contact with him anymore or spoke with him. Even after the countless times he has tried to cross her path."Do you have plans tonight? A group of us are going to the Three Broomsticks for butter beers and perhaps some fire whiskey." Pansy said while she slipped on a Slytherin jumper and a pair of brown boots."I do not. I have not had a butterbeer in ages." Astoria put her hair in a pony tale and slipped on a blue Beauxbaton jumper and they left the dorms.The group apparated in front of the Three Broomsticks and they all gathered inside. The place was jam packed with Hogwarts students and some of the Hogsmeade residents. It was difficult for them to find an open table.Pansy sat with Blaise. Lilla sat with Theodore Nott and that left Astoria to be sat next to Malfoy. She watched Pansy whisper little things into Blaise's ear and his smile gave away his happiness. Nott was telling Lilla some odd story and she seemed bored out of her wits. Astoria had never really been introduced to Theo Nott, but she heard he was a force to be reckoned with. It was also said that he had the ego the size of the castle.When the butterbeers arrived at the table the group cheered to the near end of the term."I cannot wait to spend my summer in Capri. Nude beaches. No tan lines. Endless amounts of chilled white wine by the water." Pansy explained and she went on for another ten minutes about how the Parkinson's are so fortunate to have a beach on the waterfront of Italy.Astoria quickly began to grow anxious thinking about this coming summer. It would be the summer he would be coming for her. To claim his property. Her freedom will be demolished. She will be hated by all.She managed to say the first words that came out of her mouth. "Can we get a round of fire whiskey?" she squeaked out.Nott and Zabini looked at each other with excitement and she noticed Malfoy's stare at the corner of her eyes. She smelled his expensive cologne, and when he spoke, she caught just hints of peppermint off his breath.After three shots of fire whiskey Astoria began to feel lighter, happier, and words began to start spilling from her mouth like wildfire."Cheers! To my lovely Slyther-buds and this wonderful, hot, spicy, liquid that will fill burn my throat." She raised the shot glass and clinked with everyone.She noticed after some time that Pansy and Blaise excused themselves. Probably to go snogging somewhere. Lilla and Theo ended up dancing somewhere else in the pub. She was left with Malfoy.Astoria found that her eyes wandered to him. She noticed his black, dark trench coat, his expensive dress shoes, and his platinum hair. It was brighter than she recalled, or her eyes were a little blurry.She touched his shoulder, and he met her eyes. Her hand wandered up to his neck and touched the back of his neck. He did not move but his breathing became hindered. Cautious. She examined his face with her newfound bravery. She noticed his gorgeous stormy eyes. The way his lips parted ever so lightly when his breathing became anxious.Her hand wandered to his cheek and traced her finger down to his jawline. He had a sharp, defined jaw. His eyes still locked on hers, but he made no effort to touch her or stop what she was doing. Astoria began to lift her thumb and lightly touch his bottom lip. She noticed she opened her own mouth and licked her lips. Something felt different. The way his face felt at her fingertips. The way his eyes burned through her skull.She must have begun to lean in because he moved his face from her view. She noticed Lilla and Theo slow dancing. Her head in his shoulder and his hands on her waist. She wanted that. She wanted that with Malfoy.The pub was nearly empty, except for the few stragglers.Astoria rose to her feet and made Malfoy look at her.She extended her hand. "Dance with me."Malfoy quirked an eyebrow and scoffed."You're asking me to dance, Greengrass? Are you plastered right now?" He said trying to shake off her request."Not as much as I could be." She bent over him, grabbing his hand, and lightly tugging him up. He agreed.They strode over to an empty spot where the music was playing. She felt him put his hands around her, and she put her hands around his neck. Except he was not looking down at her, but rather examining his surroundings. She wanted him to look at her. To know she was present and try to enjoy a moment.Thankfully, Astoria was wearing heeled boots and she was able to be at a certain eye level with him. Malfoy was 5'9 and Astoria was merely 5'1. He had a good eight inches on her, so any heeled height was efficient.After some time of swaying, making no progress, she decided to put her liquid courage to use. She lifted her hands from his neck and positioned his head to look at her.At first, he tried to resist, but when she was not giving up, he looked her in the eyes. She felt his hands tense around her waist. She returned her hands to his neck and began to open her hand around at the base of his neck to feel his hair slightly.Astoria felt his hands on her lower black slightly open and close. Tense and relax. Tense and relax."Why do you despise me so?" Astoria asked. She had too. The question was always on her mind. What had she done to him to make him not even want to look at her? But apparently, according to Harry, his eyes were constantly on her.Malfoy quirked an eyebrow and smirked. Then let out a low laugh.He gave a small snort. "You think I despise you, Greengrass?" She felt his arms tighten around her. It was almost arousing.Astoria breathed in slowly and looked away. "I do." She squeaked out."It's because I do." He said flatly.Great. It was confirmed. There was no point in continuing this dance.Astoria's eyes began to pool. She ripped her hands off his neck and began to break from his hold. Just before she could release herself, she felt him grab her hand and yank her back into his arms.Now she was confused. The fire whiskey was no help. He wanted her. He stated he depside her. Now he was not letting her leave his grasp."Wha- you just- "Astoria said while being pushed against his chest. Her hand in his and his arm around her.She felt his breathing slow. She heard and felt his heartbeat. The warmth of his body.She felt his hand tighten around hers and he spoke softly."Just shut the fuck up Greengrass." He said sternly and softly.She did not know why but for some odd reason it gave her comfort. She basked in this moment with Malfoy. The way he felt against her cheek. The way his arms felt around her waist. The feeling of being wanted. The feeling of security."Astoria... my darling Astoria."She heard him. In her head. No, not now. Not during this moment. She tried to squeeze her eyes shut. Practice turning off her mind."I shall see you soon. My dear Astoria."She began to shake, and her chest began to heave.Malfoy felt her shaking and he pulled her back to look into her eyes."No! NO! Out! OUT!" Astoria said loudly while hitting the sides of her head.Malfoy stood there in fear and confusion.Astoria was on the ground, in tears."Greengrass?" Malfoy said while kneeling over her. One hand on her head and the other on her hand trying to restrict her from hitting her head. "Greengrass! What the bloody hell!"Before she knew it, she felt someone lift her up and her face was cupped. It was Lilla."Baby. Tori. Listen to my voice. Breathe for me, honey, come on. In for five out for eight come on..." Lilla said lowly.In for five...Out for eight...In...Out...Breathe..."She is okay." Lilla announced.The blood was drained from Malfoy's face and he looked paler than a ghost."What the fuck just happened to her? Suddenly she began to shake and scream." Malfoy said while directing toward Astoria."Malfoy. She is fine. Take her out of here." Lilla said while lifting Astoria to her feet."Go." Lilla said sternly.The couple walked out of the bed and the cold air instantly met Astoria face. The flash of sobriety filled her head. She was back to feeling heavy and dark.She just got a remembrance of what her life entails.She thought about Mona Lisa. Why does that damn woman smile? Why is she happy? She is chained down. Forever shackled to the commands of men.Hot tears rolled down Astoria's cheeks and she glanced up at Malfoy. Still pale and still confused.All she could manage to squeak out was, "I am sorry."She began to walk away on her own. Until he caught up with her."Just wait a damn second. Merlin, Greengrass. What the hell? Do I really make you that fucking nervous that you have a panic attack in my arms?" Malfoy said sounding defeated.Astoria turned around and faced him. A look of exhaustion filled her face. Her eyes red with tears, and breath becoming heavy. She put her arms above her head in frustration and she began to pace like an erratic.She wanted to tell him everything in that moment. For the world to hear the truth.Her path is filled with darkness and decay. Everyone around her will hate her soon enough. She is collared to an immortal monster."It's not you!" She managed to belt out.She walks up to him and shoves her hands against his chest."These days. You are the only thing keeping me together. You have no idea who I am. What lies ahead for me! You will never understand. Do us both a favor Malfoy, obliviate me from your mind. Let me tell you. I am a fucking disease of a person. I will break down every cell in your body until it's all rotted at my fingertips." She said while hysterically crying and shoving his chest.Malfoy was silent for a while. Pondering what to say. Letting Astoria cry and heave onto his trench coat. What does one say when the other describes themselves as a disease?"Can I speak now?" He said plainly. Astoria lifted her head, wiped her nose and sniffled.She shrugged and tears began to pool more, and she left his glance."You need to keep your shit together, Greengrass." He said flatly with no remorse.What the fuck. Keep your shit together? She was hoping for something a tad lighter.She looked at him with rage. He had no fucking idea what goes on in her head. Before she knew it, she lunged herself toward him and her hand met his cheek abruptly.He let out a scoff and then met her eyes. Soon his eyes filled with rage and he was coming toward her. She was stuck in her position. Her feet unable to move. Frozen. Tethered to the ground below her. She was hoping he would hit her back.He moved in front of her and grabbed her by the neck and pushed her against the nearby building wall. His eyes seethed with anger and his breath reaked with peppermint. Astoria proudly showed the unnerving smirk she had on her face. She managed to speak under his grasp."What are you going to do Malfoy? I remember us being in this same situation once before." She said with a snarky tone.He opened his mouth and spoke with no regretful tone."You have no idea what I'd actually like to do to you." He breathed.His eyes burned through hers. She was seeing him. In this moment with his hand wrapped around her neck and the other on her torso keeping her still.Then she lifted her hand and grabbed hold of his neck in return. She squeezed slightly and smiled lowly. If he wanted to play games, then so could she."See? I can play rough, Draco." She whispered in his face.Before she knew it, her hand was pushed away from his neck and held to the wall with his. Her lips smashed against his and his hand releasing pressure around her neck. Malfoy ran his hand around her neck and held her head in place with force.She nipped the bottom of his lip and she felt his tongue slide into her mouth. She felt herself arching toward him and he was leaning into her. Deepening the kiss with every breath. She grabbed hold of his hair and pulled his face forward.Malfoy ran his to her lower back and began to pull her forward. Making her push up against his front. She felt it all. The rigidness. The desire. The throbbing desire that was getting worse with every nip and every kiss.In the middle of their heated exchange, she thought of Cedric. How much of a better kisser Malfoy is, he knew what he wanted, and he got what he craved. Cedric was sometimes immature and not secure enough to make her desire him fully.She felt how his lips felt with hers. Like a carefully orchestrated symphony playing through the cords. Except they both were the conductors. It seemed they took turns on who took control of the music with each pause.Malfoy had her pushed up against the wall and just as he was about to hike up around her coat the pub door busted open.Out came a drunk Lilla and Theo. Their eyes immediately shot to Malfoy and Astoria and they laughed between themselves."Fucking finally!" Lilla exclaimed."Ahh lucky night for you Mate!" Theo said while throwing Malfoy a thumbs up.Astoria saw Lilla shoot her a quick wink and her cheeks instantly blushed."Maybe we should go?" Malfoy hesitantly said.Maybe he regretted the kiss? Was Astoria a bad kisser? Did her breath smell? Was she not looking attractive right now? What could cause his hesitant remark?Astoria gripped her wand tightly and gazed upon the icy look of the lake. Focus. Focus on happiness. Think of something happy anything. She was determined to conjure a patronus.She took a deep breath in and tried to think of her family. Mother and father. Daphne. All together on Christmas. Opening presents, sipping cider, and listening to cheery tunes."Expecto Patronum!" She exclaimed.A whole lot of nothing in the air.Just as she was about to give up, again. She figured maybe try another memory. A new one.She closed her eyes and imagined his warmth. His touch. How his lips fit perfectly with hers. As just for a few minutes she felt as peace. She remembered the memory in her mind and muttered the spell one last time.Before she knew it, a bright white flew out of her wand in the shape of a snake.She was disappointed that her patronus was a snake, but she was elated she could conjure it up. She had a happy memory strong enough to conjure her patronus.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Weeks had passed since her visit to the Three Broomsticks with the Slytherin bunch. Pansy and Blaise could not keep their hands off one another. Constantly, in the common room snogging or her head was in his lap, and vice versa. Sometimes it made Astoria disgusted just to peer their way.Astoria felt as if she was living three lives in one. Her first being who she really was. A fucked-up girl with no destiny, no freedom, and a leash around her neck. A girl who wanted to create art but did not physically have enough energy to conjure up a canvas.The second life was having her nightly occulems lesson with Malfoy. He would drill her on different mind techniques, and she would do her best to keep her walls guarded and her mental wards intact.  Every time they would practice together tension would rise, one would stare too long at the other and the contact would break as quickly as it came. It was nothing like Astoria thought it would be. Her and Malfoy had not shared a kiss nor touch since that night. No matter how many times Astoria went over it in her head the outcome it always the same. Malfoy feels something for her, but she cannot decide if it is lust by hatred or lust by desire.Astoria's third and final life was her newest. The life she was living when she was participating in Dumbledore's Army. Often, when practice was about to commence Astoria found herself walking to the Room of Requirement with Hermione Granger. Of all witches of Hogwarts. Hermione fucking Granger. What a sight it was. Astoria was more than thrilled when she conjured her first patronus and she thanked Hermione for giving her such fine advice. Oddly, enough Astoria grew a soft spot for the mudblood.Since Astoria felt as if she was living for three, she was dreadfully tired more than usual. She felt herself drifting off in Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Her head hit her textbook causing a loud thud, and all eyes on hers. Eyes in particularly, Umbridge's. The foulest creature in Hogwarts.Astoria quickly picked her head up, noticed the dreadful woman in pink walking towards her and she braced herself to be scolded."Miss. Greengrass." Umbridge said in a chipper tone.Astoria rolls her eyes and looks up at the pink woman standing in front of her. She is holding her, disturbingly, pink wand to her chest and a chirpy uncomfortable smirk is splattered across her face."Professor?" She says lowly."Correct me if I am wrong." Umbridge leaned down to be at eye's length with Astoria. "Were you..." She paused. "Sleeping in my class?" The woman quirked her head to side and leaned in closer.She could smell the floral perfume radiating off her pink petty coat. Astoria inhaled deeply and nodded. She felt herself slightly shift over to Pansy who was seated beside her."Detention. Miss Greengrass. You shall spend it with me, later in my office." She said with a bounce in her voice and ended the statement with a squeal like laugh.After classes concluded for the day Astoria found herself outside Umbridge's office. She knocked quietly and the door opened abruptly. The first thing she saw was pink. So much pink in one room. Astoria looked around and saw the many cats in pictures hanging on her walls. Umbridge was throwing some logs into her fireplace and she waved her wand to make a flame."Now Miss. Greengrass. Sit." Umbridge hinted to sit at the nearby chair across from her desk. There was some parchment laid out but no quill or ink."You will be doing some lines for me today."Astoria huffed and took a seat. She had heard about Umbridge's treacherous quill and how it magically carves onto the skin of its victims. Astoria sat on the chair and braced herself."Now, I want you to write. I shall never sleep-in class."Astoria took the quill for her Professor and began to write. She had written many lines and she peered on her hand, but nothing was happening. Astoria kept on writing, and when she looked up, she had Umbridge's eyes on her. Her eyes were skeptical as she looked at her smooth hand.Astoria kept writing but still nothing was happening to her hand.Umbridge snatched the quill out of Astoria's hand and she examined it. The woman's eyes looked as if she could not believe them herself. She glanced over at Astoria and then back at the parchment. Astoria had written more than twenty lines, more than enough to have a brutal, bloody carving on the top of her hand."What did you do?" Umbridge said lowly while furrowing her eyebrows.Astoria appeared confused and as skeptical of the situation as she was. Why wasn't the quill's magic working on her? Why was she not in agonizing pain in this moment?"Professor- I" Astoria said in defense while throwing up her hands and exposing her pockets. Astoria did not even have her wand on her to prove she did not cast a protectant charm over herself nor the quill."Fascinating." Umbridge whispered while glaring at Astoria's face.With that Umbridge rose to get an even better look at Astoria. Umbridge grabbed hold of Astoria's hand and examined the skin. Ran her pink colored fingernails over the little hairs on her knuckles. Suddenly, Umbridge had her hand on the top of Astoria's head and she felt her jolt.Umbridge held her hand to her chest, as if she had been burned. Astoria was scared. Umbridge took the tip of her wand and put it under Astoria's chin."It's you. Isn't it?" Umbridge whispered while leaning in and her breathing became enhanced.Astoria was in disbelief. Who did she think she was? Who was she? Why did Umbridge have some inkling of her identity buy touching her head?Astoria fixed her posture but leaned back trying to avoid her wand. Her eyes stuck on Umbridge's. She took a deep breath and spoke."I am unsure what you are playing at Professor." She said boldly. She wanted Umbridge off her tail and to dispose of any ideas of who Astoria may or may not be.Umbridge nodded and lowered her wand. She poured more sugar into her tea and took a brief sip."You are excused." She said sternly and with that her office door flung open and she made her way out.Astoria was tired of being kept in the dark. She was obviously known about in the Dark Lord's community, which meant Umbridge was involved in his council. Astoria knew the only person who was trustworthy enough for her to seek wisdom regarding her... situation.Professor Snape.Astoria made her way to the potion's classroom, but it was empty. She tried looking around his Potions closet that was down the hall. Nowhere could she find Snape. She finally decided to try to look in his office. She had never physically been inside, but she knew where it was.On her way there, oddly enough, Professor Snape was walking down the hallway towards Dumbledore's office. She yelled out his name, but he kept moving swiftly in his black robes.She picked up the pace and began to run toward him. Astoria finally reached him just as he was about to walk up the spiral staircase."Professor! Wait! Please." She said pleadingly. He was the only person she trusted to advise her. Without him she was alone."Miss. Greengrass if you do not mind, I have pressing matters that I must attend to." He said sternly and slowly."I understand, but please I must speak with you." She said not budging.After mere moments she heard a figure walking down the stairs. It was Albus Dumbledore."Why, Severus. You brought Miss. Greengrass with you. How delightful. Come." Dumbledore led the way up to his office and Snape only exchanged a glare while she took a seat adjacent to the headmaster's desk.Astoria found herself twiddling with her thumbs and fiddling with strands of her hair out of a nervous tick.Snape stood beside the headmaster as he sat in his tall throne."Now why have you sought council with Professor Snape, Miss. Greengrass?" Dumbledore said lowly.She knew he knew the story of the Dark Lord's unborn property. Perhaps he knew of her situation. But she was not going to risk expulsion due to her needing immediate council."I only had a mere question regarding a potions essay, Sir." It was a lie. A stupid one at that. Potions was one of her favorite courses and she never had a question. She found it interesting to mix ingredients and brew such fine concoctions such as the Amortentia. A fine love potion.Dumbledore nodded and glared over at Snape whose facial expression was more than difficult to read."Miss. Greengrass. To be frank, I know of your situation." He said in a confessional tone.Her face turned red. She should run out of the room. Out of the school. Out of England. People know who she is and who she belongs too. No. She does not want to be expelled or even worse killed for being connected to the Dark Lord.She shot up out of her seat and began to walk backwards towards the door slowly."No. Please. Do not hurt me. I cannot help it. Please-Please I beg yo-"She fell to the ground into a full panic attack. Her breath began scarce and her eyesight blotchy. She could feel the blood rushing from her skull and her hands twitching uncontrollably.Make it stop. Please.Make it stop. I do not wish to feel this way.Before she knew she had a pair of old hands wrapped around her face, shaking her to come back to reality."Miss. Greengrass. Calm down, please."Make it stop. Please."Severus. I need the calming draught."Make it stop.She felt the warm potion being forced down her throat and in mere moments her heart rate steadied, her hands were calm and her eyesight still.She felt light. At ease."Are you feeling better?" Snape asked sternly in an almost bored tone.Astoria nodded and she made her way back over to the chair. She fixed her hair with her hands and pulled down her skirt to fix."I apologize." She said lowly keeping her head down."No worries my dear. I understand what you are going through is difficult." Dumbledore said with remorse.Astoria scoffed and folded her arms. She met his comforting eyes."Yeah. You have no idea.""Now, why were you seeking council with Severus? The truth if you please." Dumbledore said keeping his hands folded and his facial expression warm.Astoria sat forward and told the two men about what happened with Umbridge. How her magical torturing quill did not penetrate her skin and when Umbridge placed her hand over her head she jolted."I came to ask why the quill might not have affected me? Maybe it had to do with something about who I am?" She said flatly."It is exactly because of who you are, Miss. Greengrass. You are under his protection. You have been since before you were born. You have his dark energy flowing around you which means..." Dumbledore leaned in. "No dark magic will harm you. You are immune to anything that may cause a fatality."It all made sense. Nothing bad ever happens to Astoria physically. She was surrounded by his protective wards. The Dark Lord ensures that his property stay safe and intact."I have another question." She asked shakily.She uncrossed her legs. Leaned forward, placing her elbows on her knees, and clasping her hands."I am to be claimed this year. What will the rest of my life look like?"There was a long silence in the room. Astoria heard nothing but the sound of the evening air blowing in through the window. She heard Faux breathing slowly in his slumber. She heard her own breathing becoming slow and anxious.She noticed the nervous facial expression on both the men in front of her.Dumbledore leaned in but his face had fallen. As if he was giving a death sentence."My dear. Your life is tied to his. Wherever he goes, you will go. Whatever he wants you to be, you shall be. I am sorry to have be the one to explain this to you. The prophecy spoke of a girl. A girl with golden hair and blushed cheeks. A girl with a heart as strong as steel, and blood as thick as tar. A woman who is to be his partner. The woman is you, Astoria."Astoria felt tears rolling down her cheeks. All her life she saw the Daily Prophet headlines reading, "Harry Potter the Chosen One", "Harry Potter battles You-Know-Who!" Astoria had never thought that maybe one day Potter would have to share the spotlight with his connection to the Dark Lord. A spotlight she would be happy to step out of once the wizarding world knows the truth. She knew her life was doomed but it was never confirmed. She had to devise a plan to break this contract. Sever the bond. Even if it meant ending her own life."What do I do?" She said plainly."Be cunning and fight." He said sternly.Great advice Albus.It was soon the end of the term and Astoria had exams on her mind, the summer tragedy, facing her family soon and so many other things she ran out of fingers to count on. The days were becoming warmer, so Astoria often found herself at one of her favorite spots, next to the Black Lake. She would occasionally smoke muggle weed with Lilla and discuss how next year would be. Sometimes, when she was alone, she would conjure up a canvas and attempt to paint out her feelings. The canvas often ended up a colorful mess of grey, black and blues. Many of those paintings ended up at the bottom of the lake.Astoria was in a steep hole and with every day that passed she felt herself going deeper. She was slipping further and further into herself. She did not care what she looked like anymore. Who did she have to impress?Malfoy would not have any meaningful conversations with her anymore after their lessons. Often, before their kiss, she found him in the common room but since then he has kept to his dormitory. Not that she expected anything after that snogging. She knew how he felt about her. She knew it was a mistake, but it felt so damn right that Astoria could not wrap her mind around it.Astoria knew she was fancied among the other men who attend Hogwarts. But like all other love stories of her time, the man the lady wants often does not want her back. It has all been written before, by great writers of our time. Astoria was not expecting for him to fall in love with her, but a kind greeting every now and then would suffice. Hell, even a rude comment would suffice at this point. Fucking anything. A dirty look. A smug smirk. She wished he would throw a book at her like he used too in the common room. Anything to get acknowledgment.Astoria happen to glance at her calendar before she darted for Lilla's dormitory down the hall.June 17th, 1996. The term is nearly over. It was exams week and Astoria's head were spinning. She had her O.W. Ls exam in the morning, and she decided a little bit of a mental break would be okay.She knocked lightly on the door and it swung open instantly.Lilla was laying on her belly on the floor with her legs in the air. She was reading her DADA book, studying for the upcoming exam it seemed."What's crackin' baby?" Lilla said in a perky tone."Got anymore of that muggle smoke? My head is spinning, and I need something to ground me." Astoria said while leaning against the doorway with her arms crossed.Lilla shot up and over to her dresser drawer. She pulled out a tiny bag of cannabis and handed it to Astoria."It is just enough for one joint. Do not waste it!" Lilla said while pointing a finger and smiling.Where was a safe place to smoke this stuff? The herb had a pungent odor, so Astoria needed to find a place that was open aired.She walked past the astronomy tower stairs, she looked back, shrugged, and climbed the spiral staircase.To her surprise when she made it to the top, she found a guy dressed in a black suit standing over the side of the railing. It was Malfoy. Why is he up here? He looked as if he was in deep thought.Maybe she should leave him alone.When she attempted to turn around and head back down the stairs without being seen she heard him speak."Can I help you, Greengrass?" He said flatly without turning around."Sorry. I was just looking for a place to- uhm—smoke this." She held the bag in her hand. "I'll just go down to the lake." She attempted, once again, to exit."You can stay. I won't bite." He said while turning his head slightly to look at her.She made he way over to the railing and opened the bag. She quickly flicked her wand and the point rolled instantly.She muttered the spell incendio and the bud lit instantly. She took a large in hale and blew out the smoke.It was silent for a few minutes. A tad awkward.She offered a drag to Malfoy, but he scoffed at her."I am not smoking that muggle shit." He scorned while pushing it away."Don't knock it till' you try it." She took another inhale. "Maybe if you smoked some stimulant, then that wand that is shoved up your ass might come out." She said while exhaling.Malfoy gave her a burning glare. And just before she knew it, he snatched the joint out of her hand and he took a large inhale. She could tell that he was trying to hold in the cough.Astoria chuckled lowly. She took the joint out of his hand. With every puff she felt lighter. More in touch with herself again. It is a shame that for her to gain relief she needed a stimulant."You haven't been coming to lessons." Malfoy said flatly and without emotion.Astoria shook her head and shrugged.She had not attended lessons with Malfoy in a couple of weeks. She did not feel the need anymore. Her fate was sealed. She knew how to guard her thoughts, manage her memories, tamper memories and she was almost a master of legilimens. What more could Malfoy possibly teach her?"I've been busy." A lie. Lies after lies. Her mouth reeked of lies."I have not seen you around much at all lately." Astoria said briefly. She was hoping he would shed some light on where he has been lately."I've been busy." He sneered in her face.Astoria rolled her eyes and took the last puff of the joint. Such a pity it was finished.She flicked the bud off the tower and extended her arms for a stretch. A few more minutes of silent passed and Astoria realized he was not planning on having a conversation with her. She might as well just exit and be on with her day."Well. This has been jolly fun. I must be off." Astoria took one step before he spoke."Why have you been hanging around with bloody Saint Potter?" He sneered while furrowing his eyebrows at her.Was there a hint of jealousy in his voice? Interesting. Was Potter his trigger point?"Harry? What does it matter to you?" Astoria questioned while straightening her posture and glaring up at the tall blond."It does not." He said quickly while turning back around.Astoria let out a scoff, a light laugh and crossed her arms."Draco Malfoy. Are you jealous of Potter?" She said almost mockingly. He turned around quick and was instantly inches from her face."What the fuck do I have to be jealous of? He has no family, bobbleheads for friends and a head full of hot air.""He has me. I think that makes your head spin." She whispered in his face while giving him a smirk.She was almost as stubborn as he was. She was not afraid to mess with his head or hurt his feelings. Astoria was a strong-willed woman when she wanted to be.Before she knew it, Malfoy had his hand around her throat and backed up against the wall. His eyes filled with fury. His grip tightening with every breath. She smelled his breath on her, hints of peppermint. She noticed his other hand was on her torso, not moving, but was hard and stiff. He kept her in position against the wall. Even with her throat stricken she was scornfully smiling in his face.A face that said, "What will you do now?""Saint fucking Potter cannot possibly have you. Potter is too much of a dandelion. He probably busts every time you are next to him." He breathed in her face. Position remaining.Astoria took her hand and began to run it up Malfoy's chest until her thumb brushed up against his bottom lip. She moved her position closer and she noticed himself hardening. She let out a soft laugh and glared up at his stormy eyes."And you... harden every time you have your hand around my neck." She said lowly with a mocking tone.His face turned even more red. Rage, desire, more anger and more desire. She began to arch herself toward him, making him lean into her. She felt his hand around her throat become softer and his hand around her torso slide to her lower back. She knew what his body language was telling her.Astoria moved her hand to the back of his neck and pulled him in. Just as their lips were about to connect, she pulled away slightly and looked into his eyes."Maybe some other time." She said flatly and pushed him off her.He said nothing. But his breathing said it all. He was astounded someone refused him. Astoria was not going to be pushed around and told what to feel and when. This time she was not under the influence so she could control how her body reacts to certain instances.Before she ascended down the stairs, she fixed her skirt, and her tie. She gave Malfoy a small wave and trotted down the stairs."That's what he gets." She muttered to herself as she was strolling back to her dorm. "Learn not to ignore me. Bastard." She whispered to herself.Astoria just finished taking her OWLs and she is watching the Weasley firework show outside. So many colors, and so many students together again. Astoria was standing next to Pansy when it happened. It hit her like a knife in the skull."Astoria...""My lovely..."Before the voice could continue, she managed to block him out with occlumency. She was holding onto to Pansy not making a sound, but Pansy furrowed her brows and looked worried."Tori? Are you alright? You're pale..."Astoria shook her head. Nothing that has not happened before."I am fine." She gave a small smile and continued to watch the fireworks.Astoria decided to stay outside for a quick cigarette before heading back to her dorm room. When she looked to her left a small white light was before her, and it turned into a rabbit patronus."Astoria. We need you. Get to Umbridge's office." It was Luna's voice.Astoria flicked the cigarette and ran up the stairs to the pink office. When she burst through the door almost everyone from Dumbledore's Army was crammed into this tiny room. A green flame was burning in the fireplace and she knew she was about to travel somewhere. But where?Everyone was talking at once, but Harry made sure everyone had their wands on them. Thank goodness Astoria got one last smoke in before all this."We have to get to the Ministry." Harry said flatly and guided everyone through the fireplace.Astoria muttered the words "Ministry of Magic" and the flames took over her. When she reopened her eyes, she was standing in a black tiled fireplace in center of the Ministry. When Harry appeared, he said quickly, "We need to find the Department of Mysteries."Astoria felt queasy. Something hurt inside her head. She felt herself becoming anxious. Was she nervous? She did not know what she was walking into.With her wand in hand, she pointed it into the darkness and muttered lumos.The group made their way through the department and all she noticed were prophecies. Many cloudy spheres sitting on endless amounts of shelves.The group was soon attacked by a group of hooded figures. Death Eaters. She pointed her wand and spit out every defense spell she knew."Stupefy!""Expelliarmus!"One masked figure approached Astoria directly. She looked to her left and right and none of her peers were with her. They were fighting their own duels.The figure kept creeping closer, dodging every spell she shot their way. The masked figure removed his mask. It was a man with long platinum blond hair and deathly pale skin. She knew that smile. She knew that face. But where?"It's you... Oh my... dear..." He said softy while smirking at her. With every step he took toward her she went backward."You are her." He muttered."Stay the fuck back." She said while pointing her wand in his face."Your master is waiting for yo- ""STUPEFY!" She yelled while the tears began to pool in her eyes.She heard all her peers yelling to run because Ginny blew up the department. Everyone ran out the door and ascended down to this dirt pit with an empty archway in front.Within moments the group was in the hands of the death eaters and Astoria's hair was in a tight grip around a black, wild haired woman. The woman sniffed her and gasped. She nearly released her grip.The woman whispered into Astoria's ear. "The master's precious one is in my clutches. What an exciting night it is." The woman's breath smelt like decay and she wanted nothing more than to run for her life.A man named Sirius Black lost his life and it was the woman who had her grip around Astoria who shot a killing curse his way. Harry ran out of the room after the woman. Astoria quickly followed and wanted to stop him."Harry! Stop!" Astoria cried out.When Astoria made it back to the front of the ministry, she felt her skull ache. Her vision began to blur. She witnessed Harry pointing his wand to the woman below her.Astoria held her head in agony and she was on her knees. Her head felt as if it was splitting in two. The two ends would not come back together, and every blood vessel was popping from her head. A few mere moments she looked up to see a figure.A dark figure. It was a man, or a creature, dressed in black robes, with no hair and rotted teeth. The figure immediately made eye contact with Astoria and it smiled at her. Astoria caught her first glimpse of her master, Lord Voldemort.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996"Harry!""No, no unhand me!"Astoria felt a pair of masculine hands scoop her off the black tiled floor. She saw the Dark Lord with her naked eye, and she saw him standing over Harry. He is going to hurt Harry. She must save him. She must aid him. Astoria slightly opened her eye to notice long blond hair. Everything was distorted. She smelled peppermint and mahogany. The figure who held her in his arms was wearing black, elegant, fitted robes, followed by a frightful skull mask. Astoria tried to kick herself free but physically she was paralyzed. Why couldn't she move? Where was she going?Astoria managed to roll her head to the side, and she saw pink. So much pink in her view. Then she heard the disturbingly cheerful female voice. She knew that wretched voice."She was with Potter. I merely stunned her. When she is returned to the castle rennervate her and make sure she is secure. The Dark Lord will want no harm to her. Do you understand woman?" The tall, pale skinned, long blond-haired man said."Perfectly. Lucius." Umbridge said with a snark.Astoria awoke in the Slytherin common room. How she got there her mind cannot fathom. She got up walked over to the windows to see the merpeople in the Black Lake. Her head felt strangely clear and light. Normally, when she awoke in the morning, she would take the potions prescribed from Snape for her cranial pain. Today she was feeling better and decided to skip that step.Where was she last night? Did she go drinking with Lilla? Was she up all night talking to Pansy?She strode up to her dormitory to find Pansy asleep in her bed, and to no surprise, Blaise was next to her. His arms draped over her and they were blissfully asleep. Astoria quietly crept into the loo and that's when the pain reemerged, along with the memory of last night.She looked at herself in the mirror and to her surprise her face was far from looking normal. Her hair blond hair was matted, her bottom lip has a blood crusted slice, and she had another gash from under her chin. Astoria went to lean in closer to the mirror when her torso rubbed up against the sink and she let out a gasp.She carefully ran her hand over her torso, over her shirt and let out another small gasp. She quickly lifted her shirt over her head and noticed bruising along the bottom of her ribs. It looked as if someone grabbed her and drug her away.She remembered long blond hair, and pink. Why would someone violently handle her? Or mishandle her? She looked at herself in the mirror and began to practice her occlumency.Focus Astoria. Fucking focus. She tore through her own mind with what seemed like a mental knife. Carving through the alien walls that were not there yesterday.She soon realized someone had obliterated her, but her attempted to. A witch or wizard who is skilled in legilimens and occlumency can often tell when a certain memory is intended to be erased. The memory was trapped behind a mental wall inside herself.She muttered quietly to herself, memorada."Tori! Stay back!" Harry said while shoving Astoria back to the wall.She saw the Dark Figure coming toward her. Smiling at her and tilting his head."Astoria? My lovely..." The dark figure said while remaining in his place that was between Astoria and Harry."Stay away from him!" Astoria cried out. "Harry!"The dark figure peered over Harry's body and he waived his wand. It looked as if he was using a torture curse on Potter."Tor-Tori! Get back! Get out of here!" Harry cried out in between breaths and pants.Astoria could do nothing. She felt as if she was glued to the black tiled floor, forced to watch a torture session of her best friend.She cried onto her arm when she felt something hit her back, then it all went semi-black. She had been stunned.Astoria faltered back hitting the wall. She held her head in her hands and remembered it all. Harry. The Ministry fights. The department of mysteries. Astoria flew out of the room, grabbed a green jumper, pulled her hair into a ponytail and ran out the door.Half of the castle was awake and talking about the prior events at the ministry."Harry lies!""HE is not back! What bloody hogwash!"Astoria ran toward the Gryffindor tower and pleaded with the fat lady in the painting to let her in. She told her it was quite urgent that she needed to speak with someone beyond the wall."Please m'lady. Let me pass!" Astoria cried out, but the lady in the painting was not having it.Just before she was going to give up a Gryffindor lad was popping out from behind the door. She grabbed his shoulders and he looked stunned."Where is Harry? Harry Potter!" Astoria basically yelled in this poor boy's face.The boy's eyes widened, and his eyebrows nearly touched his hairline."I do not know! Harry never returned back to the castle last night, nor had many others from the house." The boy said while breaking his grasp against Astoria and strode off."They're gone." She said lowly.Astoria was the only one from Dumbledore's Army to return to Hogwarts. She realized that in two days' time she would be leaving to make the journey home to her parents. The term had concluded, and summer break was upon her. She quickly realized what that meant for her.She had the chance to face her demise last night, but she was too weak to say or do anything. Astoria just lied they are on the black tiled floor, helpless, weak, and afraid. Tears began to pool in her eyes and fall upon her cheeks. She could taste the crusted blood from her lips due to her biting them so often.Astoria leaned against the moving staircase and gathered her thoughts. Pull yourself together. You are a Greengrass. Greengrass...Daphne. Astoria quickly gasped and remembered Daphne was with her last night.She ran as fast as she could to the Ravenclaw tower. Someone she had never been before. She stumbled across an eagle for a knocker who spoke to her."What cannot be held or seen but can be broken?"Astoria was not Ravenclaw, but she has broken a few promises in her life to figure out this silly riddle."A Promise." She said boldly. As she did the eagle opened the door and she ran inside toward the girls' dormitories."Daphne! Daph!" She yelled out.She asked several students if they had seen in her sister, but they all looked at her with disgust. A Slytherin in the Ravenclaw common room."Astoria?" A soft voice said from behind her. It was Luna."Luna?" Astoria said softly."You're looking for your sister."Astoria nodded slowly, her eyes bloodshot and her cheeks soaked with prior tears."Tori...She... We could not find her after the attack. We assumed you took her back since we could not find you neither. She did not come back with you?"Astoria's heart felt. Her sister was gone. Where could she have gone?She cursed under her breath and strode out of the common room. Astoria realized it was time for her to go home and to confront her parents with this matter.The matter was bigger for Astoria to handle. The Dark Lord could have Daphne. She could have been captured. She would risk anything for her sister.Astoria walked out of the castle, her trunk in hand, and whipped out her wand. No use in taking the Hogwarts Express when the fastest way home is to apparate.With a short crack and a few moments, Astoria stood at the foot of Greengrass Estate. It looks just as gloomy and oddly colorful as it normally does. Eloise Greengrass always tries her best to line the house with bushes and wildflowers. To make the estate feel as if she is back in France. Astoria knew how her mother missed her home country dearly, but she also knew, her mother would follow her father anywhere he went. They had a different kind of love, a type that is acceptance and nurturing.Astoria walked up to the front door, waved her wand to open it and strode in. She saw one of the tiny houses elves polishing one of the many vases in the house."Welcome home Miss." The elf said lightly. Astoria nodded toward the creature and set off to find her parents.Her mother and father were on the terrace, sharing a pot of tea. Her father reading the Daily Prophet, her mother enjoying the morning breeze. They looked at peace. Solace. Something Astoria wished she had.She walked outside to greet them, and they welcomed her back with a warm embrace and a cup of earl grey tea."Where is your sister? Was she not planning to return with you?" Eloise questioned while taking a sip of her tea.Astoria had hoped her sister would already be here, but she quickly learned that is not the case. Daphne was not in Hogwarts, not at her family's estate and was taken from the battle. Daphne was missing.Astoria could not bring herself to disclose all the information what happened the night prior. Eloise began to cry, and Thomas held her close. Astoria's hands began to tremble. So many thoughts going through her mind. Why was she not looking after her sister? Why had she been more concerned with Harry's well-being than Daphne's? Astoria was listing out all the possible reasons why she is a terrible sister.Thomas quickly grabbed his arm and looked up at his wife and daughter. When he moved his sleeve up Astoria noticed a dark tattoo on his forearm.It looked like a skull with a lock entwined around it. An odd tattoo for her father but she was not going to judge his taste. But the look of distress came across Thomas' face as he spoke."I am being summoned. I shall return no later than night fall." He pulled Eloise in for a tight embrace and he kissed Astoria on the head and he apparated from the estate.Hours went by which felt like years. Astoria strode through the house in worry. Counted the flowers on her wall over a dozen times. Impatiently waiting for her fathers return. She had beaten her mother in a card game of gin over five times. She drank so much tea to calm her nerves, she felt as if she were about to whistle like a kettle from agony.Then she heard a short crack from the foyer. Thomas had returned. He looked horrid, beaten, distressed. He put his hand on the bottom railing of the steps and began to cry. Eloise came rushing in and threw her arms around him. She cupped his face so his eyes would meet her."What happened. Wha- ""They have her. He has her." Thomas interjected and began to cry.Then he turned to face Astoria. His eyes were red with pain and his face soaked with perspiration. Exhaustion was not a good enough word to describe her fathers' profile at this moment. He strode over to his daughter and placed a hand on her cheek."He wants you, Astoria." Her father said shakily while lowering his eyes.Astoria felt her chest begin to heave. Her eyes begin to see black; her hands began to shake but before she could have a panic attack. Astoria took deep breaths and pulled herself together."Be cunning and fight."She heard Dumbledore's words in her mind and remembered who she was. She is a Greengrass. She will fetch her sister and finally meet with her demise.She hugged her father reassuringly and gave him a warm smile."I shall fix myself, and then go save Daphne. We all knew this day was to come. We just never anticipated the exact date." Astoria said boldly.She strode up to her room and cast a glamour charm over her body. Instantly, her hair became, washed and curled. Her cheeks rosy, her eyelashes black and her lips a bold red. A black form fitted dressed hugged her curves and she felt nude-colored heels wrap around her tiny feet.Astoria regarded herself in the mirror and took deep breaths. She could do this. He was not going to hurt her. He owned her. All she wants is her sister. She kept reminding herself that she is strong, she is a Greengrass and no one takes her sister away.Astoria ascended from the staircase to find her mother and father still holding each other and barely able to look at her. She shot them one last look of warmth before she walked out the door. She pulled her wand out, pointed it up and apparated.With a short crack she had arrived outside a large dark mansion. Large bushes lined the pathway up to the tall, black gates. She made her way to the entrance when a fat, man with rat like teeth was in front of her."What do you want!" He said loudly."I am here for my sister." Astoria said boldly. The rat like man quickly stood aside and opened the gates. She walked slowly on the pathway until her eyes saw the large knocker on the front door. The doors swung open and just before she stepped in she made eye contact with a long, blond haired man. She knew him. It was the man who stunned her the night prior. Then she examined his face further and almost gasped.The memory. His memory. The long blond hair. The hints of peppermint. She looked about her surroundings and it was all coming together like a puzzle in her mind. The man standing before her with the same smirk she has seen hundreds of times of another man. A man who she cares so much for.She was standing in front of Draco's father."Welcome my dear. This way." The man directed her toward the dining hall. There in the dining hall she had many sets of eyes upon her. But only one pair of eyes mattered most.Astoria stood at the front of the hall; her heels frozen in place as she met his eyes. Those beautiful stormy grey eyes. Draco looked as if he had been stunned and rennervated before her. Then his brows began to furrow, and his eyes lowered in shame. He could not bare to look at her any further.Draco did not know who she was or how she was apart of this situation. All he knew was Astoria was here to fetch her sister."I am here to fetch my sister." Astoria said firmly while keeping her hands clasped in front of her.Lucius jolted in front of her and was merely inches from her face. His breath filled with nostrils and she could not show any emotion as a sign of weakness. Then he lowered his eyes as he was regarding the young woman who stood before him."And so, you shall. Right through there..." Lucius said slowly while pointing his walking stick in the direction of another door. Astoria was afraid to turn the knob and face reality.The Dark Lord could be behind this door. Daphne could be killed behind this door. Her dear sister who she was supposed to protect. Astoria was the strong one. Astoria swore to protect her. She failed.She hesitantly turned the knob and the door open abruptly. She found Daphne levitating in the air and the same dark figured man standing next to her."Ahhh... my lovely Astoria. At last, we meet." The Dark Lord said lowly.Astoria took a breath and took a step into the room. The door behind her shut quickly and the Dark Lord casted a muffliato charm on the room. To keep out listening ears. This was the moment that haunted her dreams. The moment that she imagined in her head so many times because she knew from this moment on there was no going back. The bond was about to be made between owner and property.

    1996The table where the Death Eaters stretched as far as the room did. The fireplace roared, and the room was dead silent. Not even a mouse dared to make a sound.It seemed as if some members of the council knew exactly who Astoria was, but some were oblivious. Sixteen years ago, when the Dark Lord's followers were minimal, only a select few were chosen to know about the contract.Draco's eyes were wandering around the room curiously. His foot began to tap impatiently on the floor. He began to fiddle with his rings that sat on his fingers. His face remained expressionless. He turned to his right to face his mother, Narcissa."Why was she brought here? What business is it of hers?" Draco inquired lowly."It twas' her sister that the Dark Lord captured, Draco." Narcissa said flatly.Draco was still confused. He began to grow more impatient. His foot tapping began to become more apparent to the rest of the council."She should not be here. She is nothing. She is- ""Darling. Listen to me." Narcissa lowered her head and pondered about her next thoughts.Narcissa needed to be quite careful with her wording. The Dark Lord would not appreciate her explaining what his news was to share. Astoria was a carefully preserved secret. Only wizards of great power know the legend, and only followers of close conduct, know the truth. Draco was not a member of the high council, yet. He was instructed to attend meetings so he would be ready for his future position amongst his family."That young lady... is..." She stopped herself briefly and took Draco's hand. "Talk to her. You may find one day you share a common grief." Narcissa said while giving her son a warm smile and squeezing his hand.A common grief? Interesting.Minutes went by and still not a sound was made from inside the room. No one at the table could even fathom what was happening beyond the door. Was Astoria being tortured? Had the Dark Lord finished off Daphne and made Astoria watch? So many ideas being tossed around silently through the dark minds that occupied the dining table.Malfoy leaned forward onto the table, with his hands clasped and his mouth brushing up against his rings. His foot tapping was in full swing and every thirty seconds his eyes shot to the door. Hoping for it to open. Hoping for any kind of sign that life was still there beyond the door.Without any warning the doors flung open. Lucius ran toward the door, flicked his wand and the levitating Daphne Greengrass disappeared. Astoria began to walk out of the room. Slowly, every step sharp. Her hands clasped at her back and her head held high. The expression on her face was stone cold.Her eyes met with Draco's at the table. She gave him not a smile, not an eye roll, not a peep. Draco's faintly furrowed his brows toward her, but she showed no reciprocation.Her body was frozen. She became numb. The bond was sealed. Soon everyone came to realize the Dark Lord had left the manor. The official meeting was to commence, and Astoria was going to take her exit when Lucius strode over to her and touched her upper back."Well, my dear, the high council meeting is about to begin. Unfortunately, now is the time you take your leave. You have your sister and your business with the Dark Lord is concluded." Lucius made eye contact with his son and gave him a sneer. "Get out, Draco." He barked.Astoria made eye contact with everyone on the high council. She gave a short nod and strode for the door. The back of her neck ached, and she went to touch her necklace, but soon realized it was gone. She had forgotten Draco took it from her. She wanted her necklace back. This had gone on long enough. Before she could reach the entry hall something grabbed hold of her arm. Draco was pulling her into the downstairs wine cellar. Astoria looked around and saw hundreds of bottles. So much fine wine in one room it was breathtaking. She still felt her emotions run numb. Her body felt numb except for her neck.She noticed Draco's blond hair as he pulled her toward a table that stood among the many shelves of bottles. He looked pale, and he had dark circles forming under his eye lids. Astoria looked at him and frowned. Even though right now she felt emotionless, something inside her body told her that Draco was in pain. She extended her hand towards his face and ran her thumb under his eye. She turned her head to the side and slightly furrowed her brows."You look tired." She said lowly not breaking eye contact.Draco scoffed and shooed her hand away. She wanted to know him more. What makes Draco Malfoy desire, what makes him ache in his heart. What keeps him awake at night. Does he have a favorite book? Does he fancy art like Astoria?"If you tell any of your little fucking friends that you saw me here- "Draco began to speak fast and with intent.Astoria shook her head and smiled lowly. She moved closer to him. She could feel his breath shaking."I need you to kiss me." She said softly. She needed to feel something. Anything. She was stuck in an endless tunnel of darkness. She could see a faint light at the end but where would it lead?Draco scoffed again and turned away. "Fuck off, Greengrass. I made that bloody mistake once. I do not intend to do it again."Astoria moved closer to him. Wrapping her arms around his black and his torso. She hugged him tightly and he spun around. Draco grabbed both her wrists and looked down at her."Fucking. Kiss me." She said bluntly.She could see the fear in his eyes. The fear of losing himself within her. The fear of belonging to someone or the fear of falling in love. But Draco or Astoria had not realized they were alike. Not able to make their own choices. Their lives were planned out for them before it began. However, they could control this moment. Draco could shove her off and leave her in the cellar. Forever wondering what it would feel like to slowly kiss Astoria sober. The other option being to get lost in the moment. To kiss her passionately, and let his whole body take over the moment. To feel a shred of happiness again.Draco decided on the second option. He charged toward her, smashed his lips upon hers and lifted her up. He set her down upon the table and Astoria ran her fingers through his hair.She felt his tongue slip into her mouth and dance around her teeth. His breathing became heavy and his hands pulled her tightly. Not loosening their grip. The couple was connected, and Astoria could feel the emotion rushing back into her mind like an express train.Want. Desire. Fear. Lust. Love.She could feel it all again. Draco broke the faint numbness that had briefly overtaken her. Astoria wrapped her legs around his waist and pulled him in yet again. Her hands slipped under his shirt and she felt the warmth of his pale skin.His breathing became heavier with every kiss they shared. Before she knew it she felt a tear fall from her eye. Just one. Draco grabbed Astoria blond hair in a fist and laid passionate kisses along her jawline, combing down to her neck. His hand began to hitch up her dress and he felt the inside of her thigh.Just as things were becoming more heated, Draco slipped his hand to the back of Astoria's neck with force and pulled. Astoria instantly cried out in pain and Draco jolted back. Astoria's hand flew to her neck and she began to breath heavy."Wha-What is it? What's wrong?" Draco said concerningly as he kept his distance.Astoria's eyes began to pool. She wondered if she should tell him what the Dark Lord had done to her. The Dark Lord needed a seal of purchase for his property and that is just what he got.Astoria hopped off the table and walked slowly toward Draco. She turned around in front of him, lifted her hair and exposed the single rune the Dark Lord implanted on her.The rune was a fresh wound and it had not begun to fully close up yet. It had a green hint of glow and the dark magic was sown into her bone and soon into her DNA.Runes were introduced to dark wizards if they ever decided to study the magic of Eldritch.Draco lightly traced around the area of the rune as he heard Astoria cry softy more. She felt his hand take her hand and turn her around. His eyes were filled with astonishment and the color from his face was drained."He-he- told me he never wants me to forget who I am." Astoria squeaked out. She lowered her hair and crossed her arms as if she were trying to cover herself in shame.She was branded. She was officially property with the stamp of approval. She felt like she had a price tag upon her neck, except the tag said "Sold."For the first time since Astoria has known Draco, he was speechless. She was hoping for a snarky comment, a rude remark or anything to break the tension."What does it mean?" Draco inquired lowly. His hands were becoming white from gripping and releasing from infuriating thoughts.Astoria looked up at Draco and leaned in."Les Biens." Astoria whispered. "The French word for Property."Astoria sat back on the top of top of the table, with her elbows on her knees. She was trying her best not to think of the pain. Not to think about the dark magic that was being imprinted on her bones. Why did he have to put it on the back of her neck? Why not her hand where it would be less painful? Why could she not just take the dark mark like any other council member?"What happened in that room?" Draco said while peering down at her. He flicked his wand and muttered the spell muffliato to keep the story out of prying ears.Astoria sat up and looked at him."You sure you want to know? You barely know me. I barely know you." She stated plainly. She was right. In most senses they were strangers. They had an odd connection. In some strange way they felt bonded together, but Astoria did not need to be attached to anyone else. One master was plenty and too much."I think I am seeing you for the first time, Greengrass." He snarked at her while shooting her a smirk and leaning against the wine shelf.Astoria leaned back on her elbows and laughed lowly."And I you. Malfoy." A warm smile left her lips and her spirits felt slightly lifted. An equal. Someone to go to for help. Someone who understood the pain she was feeling. Malfoy deserved to learn what happened in the room with the Dark Lord."Okay, if we are going to do this then I need a drink." Astoria shot out while signaling for one of the wine bottles.Malfoy obliged and grabbed two, impressively clean, wine glasses from the dusty cupboard. He set down a fine bottle of 1975 French wine from Lyon, France. A smile instantly flew across Astoria's face and she let out a soft chuckle. Draco furrowed his brows and asked her what made her laugh."The wine is from Lyon. The Beauxbaton Academy is in Lyon. It just made me think of some good memories." She said while picking up her wine glass and clinking with the pale blond before her.For the first time she was going to have a deep conversation with Malfoy. No bullshit. No more secrets. She was laid out raw for her to see. Scars and all, well runes and all. The only part that bothered her was Draco was not to be pushed on such matters. He did not enjoy opening up mentally and the only reason she knows the one story of his family is because she forced herself inside his head. This time it was going to be different. No one was forcing anyone to share what they did not want.Malfoy sipped his wine and waited for Astoria to share her story. She took a large sip of wine and sat back in her chair."When I took my first step in the room, I saw Daph levitating, unconscious in the air. I did not know if she were alive or dead, but then I saw him. Sitting there. Waiting for me. He gave me a deathly grin, like he had been waiting for me for many years" Another sip of wine down her throat. "I am to be the Dark Lord's partner. As in his one true follower. When I was a baby in my mothers' womb, I was dying. My mother was deathly ill, and it was certain I was to be still born. Until the Dark Lord came to my father and offered him a deal he could not refuse. Save his wife and child, but when his child came of age, he would belong to him." She paused and took a breath. "That's me. I am not sure if you heard the legend of the Dark Lord's unborn property?" Draco nodded slowly, still holding his wine."Well, anyway. He sat me down at this table and told me I was not ready to be by his side yet. For I am too young." She paused briefly. "However, I am not too young for him to imprint himself upon me. Before I knew it, I was immobile, up against the wall and I could feel the magical prick of a blade slicing against my skin. The rune is laced with the Dark Lord's blood along with hints of Eldritch magic. Overtime the rune's magic will seep into my bone and eventually seep into my DNA code. I am not quite sure what that means but I am pretty certain it will not be fun." She said while taking another sip.Draco listened to the rest of her story how she explained how Daphne was alive, how the Dark Lord vanished from the room.Astoria breathed slowly and noticed Draco shifting in his seat, looking a tad uncomfortable. His eyes began to wander around the room and to the bottom of his wine glass.Astoria let out a low laugh and pointed her glass toward the blond in front of her. "I did try to warn you about the path that was set out for me."Draco's eyes met hers and he cocked his head to the side slightly. Regarding her, looking through her as if she were a caged animal at the zoo. Banging on the glass trying to make the animal move or make a sound. People often enjoyed engaging creatures and putting them on display."Perhaps the road that was laid out for you, is no different than the road that was paved for me." Draco said lowly with hesitation.Malfoy was not often a person to expose his feelings or express his inner thoughts. He kept to himself and every so often when he needed release, he would take it out on a random Ravenclaw or himself when he was alone. Astoria wanted to be the person he confided in because she also needed someone like that.Astoria cocked her head to the side and crossed her legs underneath the table."Are you, Draco Malfoy, telling me you did not choose this path? The path of everlasting glory and triumph?" She said with an attitude and smirk.The blond smirked back and shook his head."Believe it or not, Greengrass. I would have chosen differently."Astoria was slightly shocked. Malfoy not wanting to follow in his father's shoes. She knew about Lucius Malfoy from her father. Closeted death eater after the last war, one of the Dark Lord's most trusted advisors and almost his right-hand man.The more Astoria pondered about what Draco said the more it made sense. She knew Draco watched her with intent during classes, but what he did not know was she was secretly watching him. Studying what he does if he has any habits or shows interest in a certain class."You enjoy muggle history. Do you not?" She said while cocking her head.Not to her surprise, Malfoy let out a laugh along with a snort, and poured himself another glass."You're a comedian. That bloody class gives me no advanced knowledge for my life." He said sternly and confidently.Astoria knew he enjoyed muggle studies because she often saw muggle books in his satchel, and when Professor Burbage explained a new muggle product Malfoy seemed intrigued. Was his blood prejudice just a façade? Did he really not give a damn about bloody purity?"Ever read the novel Pride and Prejudice?" She inquired.Malfoy's eyes shot to the wall, back down to his ring, and then back to Astoria. His hands gripped the wine glass with intent. He shook his head and pursed his lips.Astoria shrugged her shoulders. "It is my favorite and it is a muggle novel. Look into it you might enjoy it."Astoria did enjoy reading but her favorite hobby was still painting. Even though she has not painted anything remotely happy or colorful in months. Dancing with the brush along the canvas and mixing colors brought her solace. The canvas was always blank before her magical brush touched the board. She could paint anyone or anything she wanted. A girl running free in the woods in a white, laced, silky dress. Or a girl locked in a room, dressed in black, with only her thoughts to keep her company."You would enjoy such hogwash about a silly country girl." He said but then he realized what he had said. Astoria realized he had lied, and he has read the book.She gave him a laugh and smiled at him. "It is okay to read things other than, How to Destroy Your Enemies, without Regret" Astoria said in a sarcastic tone.However, Draco did not fancy in her tone or her assumptions of what he read. He slammed his glass down and began to dart for the door until Astoria shot up."Calm the hell down. Merlin. You would have thought I called you a name..." She paused but could not resist this. "Like ferret." She barked out and laughed.Malfoy stood still for a moment and then darted toward her. He hovered over her with raging eyes and a racing pulse. A part of Astoria wanted him to hit her. To feel the pain. To feel something other than lust or depression."Hit me." She said without thinking. "Just fucking do it. You cannot. You're weak." But then she realized what she was saying.Malfoy's hand flew up and almost contacted her cheek until he changed course and grabbed the back of her head, fisting her hair."I will NEVER hit a woman. You are fucking sick, Greengrass." He said while releasing her scalp.Astoria never stopped to think about the memory she had seen in Malfoy's mind. His mother had been hit by his father and Draco as surely hit a time or two with the end of his father's cane. She felt like an idiot. Never thinking about anyone else but herself, as always.She put her hands on her face and gathered herself. Astoria's hand touched the back of the table and there it was. Her family emerald necklace laid out on the table. She picked it up instantly and clasped the gem around her neck. It fit so comfortably around her throat, she missed reaching up and fiddling with it. Astoria felt ashamed for the way she behaved. She flicked her wand and conjured a piece of parchment that read,          Forgive me. Thank you for my necklace.                    A.G.She felt this was the perfect time to make her exit. She left Draco in the cellar while she apparated back to her parents' estate.Astoria and her parents decided it was the best decision to send Daphne away where she would be safe. Astoria would never forgive herself if Daphne got herself killed on account of her older sister. Eloise and Thomas devised a plan to send her to live in Scotland with relatives. Scotland was safe, and there was a perfectly good low-key school for witches to train the art of healing. It was Daphne's dream to become a healer and learn how to brew potions that aided the ill and injured. Daphne got her wish, but it came sooner than she expected. Astoria gave Daphne explicit instructions not to tell anyone she been involved with the attack on the ministry. Astoria wanted Daphne to have a clean slate and not be involved in any dark upcoming events.The end of July was approaching, and Astoria spent her days healing her fresh rune, reading books, and attempting to create paintings. Every so often she was called upon the dark council to discuss upcoming events and how she would be involved. She kept her head low but sometimes it was difficult too with the pale blond staring at her the entire time.Astoria was beginning to feel the dark affects on her magic with her newly infused rune on the back of her neck. When she would light her cigarette, she often had dark thoughts about setting her family home ablaze. When she would get into fights with her mother, she often had the thoughts of muttering the torture curse upon her. The rune was attempting to darken her magic but with every urge she resisted. She was not going to be a mental case murderer like Bellatrix LeStrange. She had to be cunning and fight. Keep herself together as much as possible.Astoria barely heard from her friends anymore. No letters came to her window and her owl kept sending her letters out but all of them remain unanswered. The only person she was conversing with was Draco Malfoy because he had no one else. These two became friends out of sheer loneliness. Astoria had not seen her master since the night she received her rune, and she was relieved. Even though these past few weeks she has come to a more subtle mental approach to her situation. She was going to keep fighting and hope it will all workout in her favor.There was another council meeting being held today. Astoria was required to attend with her father. She slipped on a black dress, tights, and her black shiny heels. She never wore her hair up anymore, for obvious reasons. She kept it either straight or curled around her face.Thomas and Astoria apparated to the front of Malfoy Manor and strolled into the main dining hall. The important people of the council sat along the table and many pieces of parchment were spread out across the mahogany table.She noticed Professor Snape at this meeting which was odd since he rarely ever attended."The first thing we need to discuss is most important. The Dark Lord requires his.. Astoria to be kept safe this coming year and term." Snape turned toward Thomas and gave him a stern facial expression. "Greengrass, the Dark Lord has deemed you and Eloise incompetent for Astoria's safety. She will be placed to live with a trusted member of the high council."Astoria felt herself sink within her. She did not want to leave her home. Why was this the Dark Lord's wish. She felt safest at her family's house. She barely knew anyone here.Thomas's eyes bulged from his head and he shot up out of his chair. "You will not take my daughter from me. She is MINE!" He yelled out.Astoria grabbed her fathers' hand and pulled him back down into his seat. He was shaking with fury. She made his eyes meet hers."It is his wish. We cannot go against his commands." Astoria turned and faced the council. "I will live with whomever my master deems worthy."Astoria felt as if she were a painting. Being auctioned off in front of men. Being sold to the highest bidder and her creator choosing a shelter the worthiest. Astoria felt like Mona Lisa.After a few rounds of the council discussing who Astoria should live with for the next month before classes reemerged. It was decided she would house with Professor Snape. How wonderful.Astoria almost hoped the Malfoy's would take her in, but they were not on the list of trusted families to house the Dark Lord's precious one. Within a fortnight Astoria will pack her bags and leave for Cokeworth. Snape lived in his family home on Spinner's End. A musty old place filled with house elves, and endless amounts of dust.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996A bed with a canopy, lined with a red comforter that had a flower design. A bookshelf with an entwined enchantment with an endless supply of novels. Astoria spent most of her days tucked away in her room, writing letters, reading magical and muggle novels. She attempted to create a painting, but not enough light shined through her window.Cokeworth is a large town located in England and is home to endless amounts of industrial workers. The air filled with smog and the sun hardly ever shined down on the people. Snape barely ever let Astoria out of Spinner's End for her protection. Protection from what Astoria had no idea.Her new term is to begin at Hogwarts in two weeks and Astoria was less than prepared. She had none of her textbooks or supplies. Astoria was entering her sixth year and she was determined to make this year one she never forgot.Astoria's parents sent her eighteen galleons for new books, robes, and anything else she needed for the start of the term. Her parents sent her more than what was needed but she assumed they were trying to provide for her as best they could.She needed her supplies, and was determined to get them in the best place. Diagon Alley. Astoria tied her hair back behind her head, slipped on a pair of black dress pants and a dark colored blouse.She ascended down the staircase to find Snape reading the Daily Prophet while sipping on his morning tea. Snape enjoyed his daily rituals so Astoria did not usually disturb him in the mornings, or ever if she could help it. Astoria and Snape were not particularly friends, but he was her guardian for the time being.When Astoria realized Snape was part of the Dark Lord's council she was not surprised. Snape often gave the intentions that his heart was dark, and he wanted nothing to do with light magic. Out of all the choices on the council for her housing, she was not surprised she had been told to go with Snape. Afterall, Snape knew her from classes. Knew her true intention and was given strict instructions. Keep her safe and slowly guide her through her journey.She peaked around the corner and held onto her satchel tightly."I-I am going to Diagon Alley. I need school supplies." She squeaked out.She was not afraid of Snape but rather intimidated by his slow talking and his mannerisms.Snape, without looking away from the paper, spoke sternly. "Do you think I would allow you to go traipsing around Diagon Alley unaccompanied?"She rolled her eyes and shifted her stance."I need to get out of here. Just for a few hours. You cannot keep me locked u-"Snape threw the newspaper on the table and glared at Astoria."I was given strict orders to keep you out of harms way." Snake spat. Moments later he paused and lifted his teacup to his mouth. "I do not intend on breaking orders, Astoria."Astoria scoffed and pounded her way back up the stairs. Back into her dungeon of a bedroom. She threw her satchel on her bed and lied on her back. She was a prisoner, she knew that already, but this time she felt she was in a cell.He could not keep her locked up forever. She was a teenage girl, and she could handle herself. She was not a child. Then she remembered where Snape keeps his floo powder. She had never traveled by floo powder alone...She opened her door slowly and peered over the banister. Snape was still in his study. She slowly walked over to his supply closet in the hallway until her hand was snatched by an old, wrinkly, house elf."Taking something the Miss. should not be?" The tiny creature said sternly.Astoria geared down at the elf and snatched her hand away."Go tend to your Master. I have pressing matters to attend to. Do not tell him I left. I give you strict instruction to tell your Master that I will be spending the day in my room." She whispered and shooed the creature away.With a small pop the elf vanished, and Astoria grabbed the powder.There was enough for her to get to Diagon Alley but not back. She figured she would find another way back to Spinner's End somehow. She needed to get out of Cokeworth.Astoria fled back into her room and put on her sunglasses and tied her hair back in a scarf. She was afraid of the wizarding folk recognizing her, and then the information finds its way back to Snape. She decided to change out of her aristocratic outfit and dress... casual. Casual. What is casual?Since she was not quite 17 yet she could not use magic, she had the trace on her backside. So, she rummaged through her closet to find the most neutral outfit she could find.She could not wear a Beauxbaton jumper she would be easily recognized. Almost all the Beauxbaton girls returned to France except for Astoria and Lilla. Fleur was still in Romania studying dragons. She had not heard from Fleur in many months the more she thought about it. If Fleur could see Astoria now, she would be ashamed of her friend. She shook off the thought and put on a dark green jumper, torn blue jeans and her black ballet flats.She threw on her satchel and strode over to her fireplace. She took the powder in her hand, threw it down and muttered Diagon Alley.Green flames surrounded her for a few moments, and she was pushed out of another fireplace and onto a white tiled floor. She gathered herself up, brushed off the ash and noticed she was in Honey Dukes. Before she left the shop, she bought herself a pack of pumpkin pasties and set off to buy her supplies.She recognized a few familiar faces from school, but none knew her. Astoria had largely shaped black sunglasses on to hide her eyes. She looked around and saw the many brick buildings that lined the alley.Astoria made it halfway down the alley until she made it to the bookstore. She immediately went over to the magical fiction section. She enjoyed a story that kept her wanting to read for hours on end. As her fingers touched the many bindings she finally found the textbooks she needed.Advanced Potion- MakingTransfiguration & Nonverbal SpellcastingFlesh-Eating Trees of the WorldThe Standard Book of Spells, Year 6Astronomy & The Cosmic AgesShe carried the books in her hand and browsed the store for more books until she heard two students conversing."Well. I heard Harry Potter fought You-Know-Who and was almost killed!" The one girl said in a hushed tone."I think that is utter hogwash. No, I heard it was all that Astoria Greengrass' fault. Which is why Daphne is not returning to Hogwarts this year. She nearly got her sister killed because of her foolishness at the attack on the ministry." The one student muttered to the other.Astoria pushed her ear up to the shelf to get a better listen in."I bet she got herself captured on purpose. I cannot tell you one person who has heard from her all summer." The one girl scoffed to her friend."I do not know her well, but I hear she can be a real arse. If you ask me she should have went back to Beauxbaton where she belongs." Both the girls laughed and walked out of the shop.Astoria slammed her galleons down on the clerk's desk and stormed out of the book shop. She was infuriated. People thought she got captured on purpose. She was hidden away for her own protection.She had to find her way back to Spinner's Edge. She kept hastily walking down alley ways and passing many different buildings."Why hello my sweet..." One dark wizard said from the shadows.She turned on her heel and went back the other way. She noticed she became lost. Where did she come in from? Where was she trying to go? She kept walking faster to the end of the alley way. She noticed she entered Knockturn Alley."Are we lost my dear?" One ugly, short, haggard looking witch said as she crawled from the shadows. The old witch crept closer to Astoria and leaned in to smell her. The hag's eyes widened and bulged from her head. She lunged toward Astoria and grabbed her hair from her scarf."You are her! I can smell him running through your veins!" The old hag gripped Astoria wrist and rubbed her hand against the hag's cheek.Astoria jerked herself free and ran down the dark alley. Her scarf had been torn and she was exposed. She was scared that more people would discover who she was. How did the hag know her identity? Why was she... how could she smell her blood? As Astoria was rushing down yet another dark alley pathway her elbow was caught by a strong grip."What the bloody hell are you doing here?" The male figure said before her.Astoria focused in with little light she had a saw the platinum hair. She knew that voice and she smelled peppermint on his breath. Draco had her by the elbow and was glaring at her with tired, sunken but yet rage filled eyes."I—I needed school supplies." She said while she stammered."You should have been accompanied. Why did Snape let you out?" Draco inquired, not releasing his grip on her arm.Astoria rolled her eyes and attempted to jerk her arm free."I am TIRED of being locked in a room. It's..." She paused to speak in a lower tone. "It is bad enough I am a prisoner for the rest of my life, but I did not agree to a jail cell."Finally Draco let her arm go free and lowered his head. He peered around him and lowered his head to meet her eyes."Fine. But you are going back to Spinner's End.""NO." She snapped. "Not yet. I do not want to go back yet. I will be locked up for another two weeks until the term starts. If I must go back, there and stare up at the ceiling in boredom I am going to pitch myself out the window!" Astoria said rather pathetically.If Draco were to return her to Snape, then questions would be raised. How did she get out? How did she sneak past Snape? Then she would be in trouble with her master and Snape would receive a punishment from the Dark Lord.At this moment Astoria did not care. She was tired of people making decisions for her, telling her what to do and how to feel. She was already imprinted with the Dark Lord's blood, how much more of a commitment did the demon need?Draco shook his head and leaned against the wall.Finally, after a few minutes of pondering thoughts Draco spoke slowly."Alright. You do not want to go back? Then you come with me." Draco spat.Astoria's eyes widened and she felt a twinge of excitement in her belly. She was finally going to do something new and exciting. The only "friend" she had this summer was Malfoy and the merely exchanged small talk, glances and had a few intimate conversations.Draco took Astoria and led her to a nearby dead-end brick wall. When muggles see a dead end, wizards see a pathway. Astoria peered at Draco and rose her eyebrows. He extended her arm toward her."Take my arm and do not let go." He said sternly.She furrowed her brows and gave a nervous hesitation and snatched her hand away."Where are we going?" She said lowly.Draco shrugged his shoulders and lifted his arm toward her again, signaling for her to take hold. Astoria inhaled slowly and exhaled deeply. She looked into those tired, stormy eyes and grabbed his arm.With a short crack they re-appeared in front of cliffs, and the ocean. She peered down below to find a musty old shack nestled along the beach. There was not another house in sight for miles. The sound of the waves filled Astoria's ears. Before she knew it, a smile was across her face. Astoria had not been to a beach or near the ocean in ages.She turned sharply toward Draco and he glared down at her."Uhm. Where exactly are we?"Draco began to ascend down the hill.He yelled from behind him. "Porthcurno!"Porthcurno was widely known as a highly populated muggle town. This gave great relief to Astoria. She would not have to worry about running in a witch or wizard. She did not want to run into another old hag and have her sniffing out her blood. Disgusting.She kicked off her ballet flats and sprinted down to the beach, passing Malfoy on the way, and laughing like a mad woman. She soaked her feet in the ocean, and she noticed the blond standing a few feet behind her.Draco was dressed in a black suit and his dress shoes were sinking into the sand. Astoria noticed how aristocratic he looked, and she laughed lowly."You're absolutely bonkers. You know that Greengrass?" Malfoy said light heartedly.With the sea wind flowing through Astoria's hair, she was glowing from head to toe. She was smiling from cheek to cheek and her mood was instantly shifted. This was the first good day she had a very long time.Astoria felt like a normal woman at this moment, with her bare feet in the water and feeling the wind flow through her scalp.She laughed into the world like no one else existed. "I am bonkers? You are the one wearing the suit." She said while pointing at him.She then noticed Draco peering down at himself and then he crossed his arms. She could not understand how he was not excessively perspiring in the suit. She was wearing jeans and a jumper, and beads of sweat were forming on the top of her lip."Did you expect me to show up to Diagon Alley wearing jeans and a battered muggle shirt?" He said while snarking at her.Astoria ran her hands through her hair and for a moment her fingers touched the rune on the back of her neck. As quickly as her smile came it left. She remembered she was not a free woman, and soon this happiness was going to expire.Malfoy noticed her shift in moon when she touched the back of her neck. Then he quickly wanted to diverge to attention.He invited her into the shack and Astoria inched into the foyer and began to look around. She admired how it was beautifully decorated. A beach themed bathroom, sand colored furniture and she noticed only a few pictures of the Malfoy family.Malfoy crept up behind her as she was holding a photograph of Narcissa standing near a toddler Draco as he waded near the ocean."It's my Grandmother's house. My family and I use it as a safe house." He said lowly while peering over her shoulder.Astoria set the picture down and walked over to the nearby windowsill and sat."It's beautiful here. Peaceful. Why were you coming to a safe house?"Draco twitched his jawline and began to fiddle with his Slytherin ring."My mother likes for this place to remain undisturbed so every so often I am instructed to keep the wards in place."Astoria was surprised that the Malfoy family had a beach home that was in a muggle town in England. She assumed they would steer clear of all non-magic folk."I am going to repair the wards. You stay put. Don't do anything stupid." Draco said as he walked out of the house.Astoria decided this would be a fun time to explore her new environment. Rooms to see, things to snoop. She was still so curious about Draco and about the Malfoy family as whole. Astoria ascended to the upstairs bedrooms and came across the master bedroom. A standard king-sized bed, a bureau, and two night-stand tables. Astoria, being the nosey witch that she is, opened the night-stand drawers. Inside the first one she found more photographs of the Malfoy family. She noticed one that showed Narcissa and Lucius, very young, standing at the foot of the beach. The photograph moved ever so slightly from a smile to a kiss. They looked so in love. The next photo was of all the whole family. Narcissa holding infant Draco and Lucius with his hand on Astoria's shoulder, looking cold. Narcissa looked like a sweet woman and mother. Astoria strode over to the next night-stand table and inside she found a letter with a green "M" wax sealed on it. It was addressed to Draco. She decided to not open it and respect his privacy.Astoria cautiously peered out the nearby window to find Draco still inside repairing the wards on the shack. She decided to explore the next bedroom. When she tried to open the door, it was locked. She could not use the unlock charm, since she still had the trace on her. So, she decidedly to be witty and use a bobby pin that was stuck in her hair. She fiddled with the lock for a minute before she heard a faint click and she pushed herself inside. It appeared to be Draco's room. A queen-sized bed with maroon sheets, a dark wood dresser and a bookshelf. She strode right over to the books to see what he desired to read. Did he enjoy poetry? Dark fiction? Magical novels by great wizards?Her finger swayed across the many titles and one caught her eye. She yanked the novel off the shelf and her hunch had been correct."Pride and Prejudice." She whispered to herself as she clutched the book close to her chest. "He has read it." She muttered to herself while releasing a low grin.She was not sure why the thought of him reading her favorite muggle novel lifted her spirits. Astoria felt she knew him a little more in this moment.When Astoria was browsing through the rest of Draco's book collection, she heard someone rushing up the stairs. She quickly fumbled on herself, dropping the book and her looking guilty.Draco stalked into the room and stood at the door, with his arms crossed, and his brows furrowed. She was caught snooping around his parents' house."Do you mind?" He said with an icy tone. Draco was obviously irritated that Astoria was going through his personal bookshelf.Astoria's face turned into a tomato and she picked up the book on the floor. She strode over to him and held it out in front of him."Never read it, huh?" She said while placing the book on his chest and she ascended quickly back downstairs.She heard Malfoy come after her and she was already outside on the porch lighting a cigarette."Do not smoke that bloody cancer stick." He demanded trying to swat it out of her hand."Fuck off." She said with the cigarette between her lips. She whipped out a match and lit the bud. "If I want to pollute my lungs, it is my damn right." Astoria took several drags from her cigarette."Would you care to explain why you decided to rummage through my belongings?" Draco said as he stood leaning against the porch railing.Astoria shrugged, not making eye-contact with the blond in front of her. "What can I say? I am one nosey bitch."That part was true. She was a nosey person and she liked to know everyone's personal business. She did not appreciate Draco lying to her about not reading Pride & Prejudice. It was her favorite novel and Draco spat on it when they were conversing in the wine cellar."You lied to me." She said sternly.Malfoy seemed a tad confused, and he shook his head slightly. Trying to figure out what she meant or when he lied to her."What do you bloody mea- ""You read Pride and Prejudice. You lied to me in that wine cellar."Malfoy's facial expression was astonishment, and his hands flew in the air."You are mad over a bloody muggle book?" He blurted out.Astoria sat forward, with her cigarette in hand, and her eyes burning through his."That is not the point, Malfoy. That book means more to me than you will ever come to realize. That conversation in the wine cellar was not an easy one for me. I told you about what he had done to me that night." She took a breath and took a drag. "I was broken down, beaten and felt emotionally numb that night. I tried to understand you. Tried to connect with you, but you spat all over a story that makes me feel at home." The eyes began to pool, but she quickly pulled herself back. "No. Fuck. It is not the damn book. It is you. It is the mere fact that you lied to me. What else have you lied to me about? You have told me numerous times I am nothing, and that I am a whore. So, why would you waste time and energy conjuring up a bloody lie about not reading a book?"Astoria sat back in her chair and flicked her cigarette off the porch. She had her head leaning on her hand, waiting for Malfoy's response.He was running his hand through his hair, was clenching his jaw and he kept adjusting his posture."It's just a book, Greengrass." He finally said lowly.Astoria was annoyed with the conversation. Talking to Malfoy was like trying to argue with Peeves. The conversation was going nowhere.She quickly picked herself up and attempted to pass him, until he stepped in her path."Move." She said sternly.He was not budging or making a noise. His breathing was beginning to slow, and his hands were clenching.Malfoy finally turned his head and opened his mouth."I read the book last summer. It was a recommendation from my mother. She told me to learn the hardships of love and marriage. I quickly realized a lot of what happened in the novel was a parallel to my parents' own marriage. I did not enjoy reading it, if that is what you are going to ask next."Astoria was astounded she got an answer from him on why he had the book. Then she felt an ache in her belly that the Malfoy marriage is not what it is cracked up to be.Astoria acted boldly and wrapped her arms around the pale man in front of her. She held him still, listening to his heartbeat and then after a minute he wrapped his arms around her and squeezed slightly. She felt his sorrows melt away and this was her way of forgiving him for lying, and her apology for snooping through the house.When the couple broke apart, Malfoy glanced at the clock in the shack. His eyes bulged out and he looked nervous."We need to go. Snape is going to realize you are missing. Then I am fucked." He said anxiously."No! Come on. Let us stay a little longer. Nobody knows I am with you. I told the house elf I will be spending much of the day locked in my room. Snape never bothers me. I promise you." She said while walking back into the shack.She was not ready to return to Spinner's End. As she walked into the tiny living room, she noticed a deck of cards tucked beneath some old newspapers. Astoria was rather skilled at the art of card games. She would often play with her Grandfather and when she started to become good, he let her bet with sickles.She bought herself a new Beauxbaton hat once with all her winnings. Her Grandfather refused to play with her for money after she turned twelve.Malfoy barged back into the doorway and looked frantic."We cannot stay here. People are going to look for me. If he realizes you are gone, you are fucked, and Snape's fucked. Do you understand?" Malfoy said sternly, waiting for her to walk out the door.Astoria strode over to him in the hopes he would simmer down. "Listen to me. If anything happens, I will vouch. Master is not going to let anything happen to the people I care most about." She said quickly. She had not thought about what she was going to say before it spilled from her mouth, but no taking it back now.Malfoy noticed her choice of words as well and she noticed a shift of attitude.She held the cards up against her and cocked her head."One game of traditional poker. I win, we stay here for a few more hours. You win, you take me back to my jail cell at Spinner's End. Deal?" She held out her hand.Malfoy pondered for a few moments and a smirk came across his face and he grabbed her hand for a firm shake."You have no idea what you just done. Prepare to be burned to ash with cards, Greengrass."Malfoy and Astoria sat across from one another and played on the coffee table. Astoria was the dealer and gave each of them five cards.A few trading of cards, poker checks, low laughs, and a few dirty smirks later the came was ending.Astoria lowered her head in sadness and laid out of two pair of kings on the table.Malfoy let out a chuckle, with a snort and exposed his full house. He sat back on the sofa and crossed his leg over his knee."I win." He said cheerfully while uncrossing his arms.Astoria pretended to pout and began to re-shuffle the cards."Best two out of three. Same terms." She said sternly.Malfoy scoffed and nodded. He was to be the dealer this time.Astoria furrowed her brows and gave him a low smirk. He had fallen into her poker trap. The first gave she won a baby straight and Malfoy only had a measly pair of duces."Bloody hell." Malfoy said sternly and handed the cards back to Astoria.She shuffled the cards between her hands, and she looked up to notice Malfoy staring at her intently. She felt a slight blush coming over her cheeks. She flipped her hair over to the side and handed each other five last cards.Malfoy discarded three of his five and when he received his news cards a smile came across his face. He thought he was going to win.Astoria discarded two of her five cards and she realized she had just what she needed for a Royal Flush. Nothing beats a royal flush. She had this card game in her pocket.Malfoy looked at Astoria while he laid out his cards on the table.He pointed at the straight he had with hearts. He put his hand in his hands and sat back.Astoria let out a soft huff and cocked her head to the side. She laid out each card one by one and with each card Malfoy's face dropped more and more."Royal flush. I win." She said lowly.Malfoy sat forward and burned through her eyes. His hands began to twitch with his rings."You hustled me." He said lowly."Indeed." She said confidently.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Astoria was going to enjoy as much time she had left in Porthcurno. Draco and Astoria played a few more rounds of cards, and the next wager included whoever lost, was stuck cooking dinner.After two rounds of Malfoy making a poker come back, he won the wager.Astoria had never cooked a meal in her life, but there was no time like the present to try. She strode into the kitchen and looked inside the icebox for ingredients.The only thing that was in fridge were eggs, sausages, and potatoes. She huffed and decided she was going to make bangers and mash. How hard could it be? She took the kettle out from the shelf and put on a pot.While the tea was heating, she noticed the record player nearby. A touch of dinner music would not hurt anyone, and to her surprise she found some her favorite records. The album Rumors by Fleetwood Mac, her favorite band.Astoria was very excited and let the music stroll into her ears. Astoria began to cook the sausages in the pot until Draco came into the kitchen."Do we really have to listen to this absurd music?" He said while rolling his eyes.Astoria turned around and glared at him."Just let the record play. Once it's over you can spin whatever you wish." She said cheerfully while flipping the sausages."Have you ever picked up a cooking pot in your life?" Draco said lowly while peering over her shoulder."Erm... no." She said while licking her lips.Astoria was an aristocratic woman and in her house the elves did the cleaning, cooking and yard work. She had no need to lift a finger."You're going to burn the potatoes." Draco said while scooting her over and trying to take control.Astoria budged him back and shooed his hands away from the stove."Bug off. I can do this." She said while trying to keep the potatoes from burning before her. Another minute on the heat and the mashed potatoes were going to become mashed ash.She finally took the food off the stove and plated it. It was nothing fancy, but it had to do.Well, did she make you cry?Make you break down.Shatter your illusions of love?The song Gold Dust Woman was filling the kitchen and Astoria's humming was more than apparent. Malfoy kept glaring toward her across the table, lowly laughing to himself."What brings you so much amusement? Is my cooking funny?" Astoria shot at him.She did try her best at cooking. What did he expect, five-star quality? Draco was probably no better cook than her, but she tried. Which is more than she would ever expect of him."No. It is your humming. I cannot believe you listen to this bloody music. Your music taste is atrocious."Astoria put her fork down and looked at him with a stern face."Maybe I am just a hippie woman at heart." She scoffed.Draco Malfoy let out a bellowing laugh. She never heard him laugh so hard. He was laughing so hard he let out a snort. That made Astoria laughs. The couple was laughing at each other for almost five minutes."You- you are far from that, Greengrass. Have you seen yourself when you go out?"What was he trying to imply? That she dressed a certain way that was negative or that he did not like the way she dressed. She knew she wore black more than any other girl, but it was her color. She enjoyed looking fierce and in-control. Bright colors were never in her wardrobe."I have seen what I dress in when I go out. I now know you have noticed as well." She said confidently.He noticed what she was saying, and he was trying to retaliate a response. Change the subject. But he was caught. Astoria knew he always watched her, but she never called him out for it, but this time he walked into his own trap.As Astoria finished eating her bangers and mash, she threw the dishes into the sink and peered out the window. It was a beautiful night and the water looked angelic under the moonlight. She had a thought of doing something crazy.She turned on her heel to face Malfoy who was still sitting on the kitchen chair. She noticed he kept checking the clock, but she was tired of looking at the clock.She pursed her lips and furrowed her brows."What?" He said while trying to get a read on her."Come out with me." She said while extending her arm.Malfoy looked outside, back at the clock and shook his head."We need to get out of here. We should not have stayed." He said sternly.Astoria rolled her eyes and let her arm fall to her side. She gave him a piercing look and darted for the door. She ran to the edge of the beach and she heard Draco following her.She kicked off her shoes and let her toes seep into the sand. The water hit her feet ever so slightly and it was angelic. She wanted to feel the wave of the ocean more. Astoria wanted to do something she would never forget.As she was staring out onto the water, she felt the presence of the pale blond behind her. Not saying anything but she could feel his eyes on her. She wished he would touch her lightly."Astoria." He said lowly in her ear.She turned her head to peer over her shoulder and hummed softly."We cannot stay. Please come." He said almost pleading.She felt horrible for keeping him away for so long, but this was the most solace she has felt in quite a while. She was being selfish and did not want it to end.She felt her eyes beginning to pool and she came to the realization it was time. But maybe not just yet. A few more minutes. One more happy memory she wanted to create and hold onto."Okay." She whispered. She felt the tears roll down her cheeks, but she managed to speak again. "I just want to do one more thing."His presence behind her was intoxicating. She could feel his energy vibrating through her. She wanted desperately to hold onto him and take all the pain he felt in his life. She did not know what she was feeling quite yet.Astoria and Draco oddly became connected since the day Daphne was fetched by her sister. She felt as if she was seeing the real Draco Malfoy and he was seeing the real Astoria Greengrass.Since he knew her on the inside. Who she was, what she was, what her life journey entailed. She figured he was not going to mind seeing her on the outside as well. He told her once she was beautiful, hopefully he would continue to think that after tonight.Astoria began to unbutton her jeans and sliding them to the sandy beach. She lifted the jumper over her head and tossed it aside. She was merely in her undergarments.She could hear Malfoy behind her breathing down on her. Hearing his breath become deeper and scarcer.She felt no shame in how she was looking, until she went to tie her hair up. When she hands grazed over the rune her hand covered it. She was ashamed of it. She never wore her hair up since the day she had gotten it imprinted on her. When her hand covered it, she felt Draco's hand touch hers.He lowered her hand and kept it at her side. He slightly bent down behind her to whisper in her ear."I-I have been meaning to put an invisibility charm on that." She squeaked out.Draco's thumb grazed over the rune lightly and she felt her chest begin to heave. She was not used to someone seeing her rune, her imprint, her shame."It's okay. We all have our scars." He said in her ear, still lightly touching the rune.Astoria took his hand and spun around to face him. His face had fallen and the look in eyes was stormy. He felt her pain. He knew her pain.She turned her head back around to look out at the water and peered back at him. She wiped her tears away and tilted her head."Come on." She said while tugging at his hand.He shook his head and retracted his arm."You really are bonkers. I am not getting in the water." He said while shoving his hands in his pockets.Astoria scoffed and tightened her ponytail. She tried to yank his arm again but he would not budge."Come on. Do not be such a stiff..." While Draco was beginning to shake his head again Astoria said, "... ferret." While letting out a low chuckle.Draco's head shot up and he cocked his head to the side."What did you just call me, Greengrass" He said while beginning to walk toward her slowly, and Astoria backing up in the process."Ferret!" She blurted out and she ran into the ocean before he could catch her.Astoria dove into the black water and let the salt seep into her skin. It felt angelic. When he peered back at the beach, she noticed Draco unbuttoning his shirt and trapsing into the water.She laughed suddenly as he almost tripped on a few seashells and he cursed beneath his breath. After some time of watching him struggle she swam near him."Glad you decided to join me." She said while treading water."Did not give me much choice. Since you called me ferret!" He said loudly while shoving her head under the water.When she was released from his grip, she splashed water in his face, and he did the same to her.A slight silence came over the couple and they found themselves glaring at one another. Astoria was regarding Draco in front of her. He was an attractive man, but she wanted nothing more to grab him and kiss him in the ocean."Ever think about what you'll do once you're done with school?" She asked.Maybe he had dreams of going off to another country to study. Become a famous writer or anything he put his mind too. She wanted to know his mind better.Draco scoffed. "I presume I will be working alongside my father. It's a Malfoy tradition for sons to work in the Ministry." He said lowly and slapping the water.He then did something that was rare. He inquired about her own dreams."What about you?"Astoria let out a loud laugh along with a scoff. A future? What damn future? Her future is handcuffed to the immortal Dark Lord for the rest of her days."You have seen the imprint I have on the back of my bloody neck, correct? You honestly think I can have a future?" She said sarcastically.Draco realized he had not realized what he asked when he did. The future was a touchy subject for Astoria. She was tired of people assuming she had any choice left in her life."I understand." He said lowly.That set her off. He did not understand. How could he? He may have a beat for a father and a family line of Death Eaters, but nothing compared to the daily pain and heart ache Astoria felt."You do NOT understand, God dammit. You have fucking choices in your life. You do not have a leash on you. Hell..." She reached for his left arm and held it up out of the water. "You do not even have the bloody mark. You are untraceable. You could leave and never return. YOU have that option, I NEVER will. So do not try and presume you understand what I feel." She said sternly while aggressively releasing his hand.Astoria began to swim back to shore until she felt Draco catch her by the waist and he propped her up with her legs entwined around it."LET ME GO!" She screamed in his face."No. Merlin. Stop it!" Draco said while trying to restrain Astoria. But she was too angry to see reason.After many attempts of breaking free she finally gave up and sat there silently, while he held her. She would not admit but it felt nice. With his arms around her bare body, her chest colliding with his. Some provocative thoughts were roaming her mind, but she tried her best to stray from those cloudy dreams."Why. Fuck why is it always you who must be here! Why did you not just let me coke myself to death in London. Why did you have to pull me away?" She said while unraveling in-between him.Draco let out a deep breath and put his head to her shoulder."I was not going to watch you kill yourself over a mere Hufflepuff. I watched you once attempt that shit and it was not going to happen again."Astoria cocked her head back and met his eyes."Why. Just why. You tell me I am nothin- ""You are something." He said lowly.Something. She was something but what?"Something?" She scoffed and released herself from his grasp. "It's time for me to return to Spinner's End."It was almost three in the morning when she crept inside Snape's house and he was inside waiting for her.She tried to creep up the stairs silently until she was pelted back against the wall by a hex Snape shot at her."Where in the bloody hell were you." He said lowly and slowly.Why did he have to speak so slow? Sometimes it was infuriating."I-I... I was-... I needed school supplies. I told you." She said while keeping her head and she noticed Snape shot up and was two inches from her face."Do you have any idea what could have happened to you if someone figured out who you were! Do you realize you have the Dark Lord's blood running through your veins? Vampires could sniff you out in an instant. You foolish girl!"She put her hands in her hair and let out a frustrated scream."This house is a prison! I am tired of being in a jail cell! It's not like I was alon- ""Pardon me?" Snape said.Shit. She messed up. She just outed herself and Draco. Now she had to come clean otherwise Snape would know she is lying. He is the best occlumens in the wizarding world."I was not alone. I was- I was with Draco." She squeaked out while fiddling with her necklace."Malfoy? Why on Earth was he with you? Did he help you orchestrate this?" Snape inquired."No!" She blurted out. "He saved me while I was lost in Knockturn Alley. I went down a wrong path and he grabbed me in time."Snape walked away from her but then turned around swiftly."Do you have any idea what you have done? If the Dark Lord finds out he is the one who was responsible for keeping you away from surveillance...""But it was not his fault! Honestly, Professor. It was me. I did not want to leave." She pleaded.She did not want anything to happen to Draco. This was all her fault, and she was going to fix it. In any way shape or form. She could officially call Draco a good friend of hers and she was going to protect him. Even if that meant facing the Dark Lord herself to vouch for his loyalty.The next afternoon and owl came busting into the kitchen window nearly sending Astoria's teacup across the room. Snape was strolling in and took the letter clasped in the owl's beak.His brows furrowed and he handed Astoria the letter. She read the letter and immediately rushed out of her chair and put on a black jumper. The letter read as followed.Snape,It has come to our attention that our precious one had slipped through your clutches yesterday. We know why and we have the boy here to answer questions.DolohovThey had Draco and she did not know what they were going to do to him. All she knew was she had to get to Malfoy Manor. When she ascended back down the stairs, Snape was standing in front of the door."I apologize Professor, but I am leaving. I cannot let Draco get punished for wrong-doings."Snape looked around the house and let out a sigh."I am going with you." He said lowly.Snape and Astoria walked behind the house and apparated in front of Malfoy Manor. Astoria did not know what she would be walking into, but she felt lucky to have Snape there with her.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Astoria observed the tall structure that stood before her. Keep yourself calm, she kept reminding herself. Steady your breathing, Astoria, she kept saying in her mind.Snape, with his stiff posture, shot Astoria a look and she nodded."Keep your mouth closed and head up. You are the one they fear, Miss. Greengrass." Snape said lowly and with concerning hints.Astoria never gave much thought to if people feared her. At Hogwarts she knew some people disliked her for who she was, what she did with Cedric and how she betrayed Daphne. She was often caught by house prefects for smoking on the open grounds. Smoking was considered a filthy habit and it was not regarded as something proper witches did. Astoria would always get caught by the Gryffindor prefects. Gryffindor's always had their noses in situations that did not concern them.The more she thought about it, Astoria could really use a calming smoke at this moment.Why would people fear her? Astoria was a brilliant witch but was in no position to take on a master duelist or great wizard like Dumbledore. The thought of being feared gave Astoria an odd ego boost. If people feared her, then surely, they would heed her requests.Snape and Astoria walked into Malfoy Manor and she had her wand clutched to her side. Ready for use at any given moment."Severus?" Lucius said as he peered through the living room. "To whom do I owe the pleasure for this visit?""Dolohov sent me an owl." Snape regarded in a low, drawled out tone.Lucius then set his gaze upon Astoria and quirked an eyebrow. He was two inches from her face and lifted his cane to move a piece of hair from her forehead."And you brought the Dark Lord's precious one. My... my, this is a... great honor... Miss. Greengrass..."Astoria backed away from Lucius and gave him a stern look with piercing eyes."Where is Draco?" Astoria blurted out.She could tell Snape was agitated by her speaking, but she was tired of fooling around. She wanted to know if Draco was okay and where he was. She needed to physically see he was left unharmed.Lucius took in a deep breath and flipped his long platinum hair over his shoulder."Why is my son's whereabouts your concern, girl?" He blurted out.Snape interjected sharply. "Answer the question, Lucius."Lucius snarked and let out a snort. "I do not have to answer to you Severus. That clown Dolohov did wrong by telling you Draco was taken away for questioning."Astoria's eye began to pool, and her hand began to become stiff from clutching her wand so tightly. Rage was building up inside of her. She felt herself becoming consumed with clouded thoughts."He is to be punished for kidnapping Miss. Greengrass here. He deserves anything the Dark Lord does to him- "Astoria pointed her wand in Lucius' face, her eyes filled with rage, her heart began to ache and a pit in her stomach was beginning to explode with grief. This was her fault. If Draco dies from torture, his blood will forever be on Astoria's hands."Tell me where he is!" Astoria roared.Lucius let out a blood curdling laugh and began to lightly push the tip of Astoria's wand out of his face."What are you going to do to me if I do not?" He paused. "Levitate me to death? Or perhaps cook me some bangers and mash? Or perhaps- "Lucius' voice was cut off by Astoria's anger filled unforgiveable curse being spat at in his face."Crucio!"She felt the power of the dark magic flowing through her veins. Her wand, unyielding. Her blood, boiling like lava."Greengrass!" Snape bellowed in her ear.Astoria could hear Lucius' cry of torture in her ears, it sounded like music. She felt powerful in this moment, she felt feared. She pointed her wand deliberately at Lucius' temple and his screams became more intense.Astoria's gaze was strong until she saw Narcissa collapse next to her husband, begging for her to stop the torture. Astoria snapped out the dark magic gaze and she blinked slowly. She did not feel an ounce of regret. She gave Lucius a sneering look and bent down next to him."Tell me... where the hell Draco is, or I will continue the curse until you are cold."Astoria had had enough playing around she wanted answers. She was not leaving that spot until Lucius spoke up, but it was not Lucius who opened his mouth. For it was Narcissa who confessed Draco's whereabouts."Draco is here! He is here!" Narcissa whaled out while clutching her husband's hand."He was questioned by Dolohov. Draco confessed everything that happened with you." Narcissa sobbed and covered her mouth. "His punishment is to be carried out at sunset. The Dark Lord will perform it himself."Astoria blinked but could not figure out what she meant."Tell me what his punishment entails." Astoria said lowly to Narcissa with grieving eyes."The Dark Lord does not want his loyalty put into question anymore." She inhaled and exhaled deeply. "Draco is to get a set of runes entwined with the Dark Lord's blood." Narcissa lowered her head towards Lucius.Astoria eyes filled with tears. She had done this to him, he was going to go through the same agony Astoria had while receiving her single rune. Draco was to be punishment by forcing his undying loyalty.She had to fix this."No. I will not allow that." Astoria rose and crossed her arms while standing in front of Snape.She turned sharply to face Severus and his face looked stone cold."Call him. Now. I want to speak with the Dark Lord." She said boldly."Are you mad, girl?" Snape said lowly while trying to meet her eyes, but her eyes were fixed on a nearby Malfoy portrait.She watched his eleven-year-old Draco had that sour look on his face with Narcissa holding his shoulder. Lucius looking cold as usual. She wanted to save the boy she cared about from a life of undying servitude."Call him before I slit both my wrists on this floor right now. Then you all can explain why the Dark Lords 'precious one' is bleeding out on your marble floor." She said sarcastically.Astoria strode outside to sit on the patio she put her head back in exhaustion. She had not slept in almost twenty-four hours but she was determined to see this mission through. She was going to have a word with Voldemort regarding Draco's punishment. Sway him in any way she could. Astoria's heart ached for how guilty she felt. Astoria made Draco stay late and it was her fault for being unaccompanied in Diagon Alley. If she could not fix this then Draco would be getting a set of dark magic runes on his skin.Astoria decided to light herself a cigarette and clear her mind before she met with her master. She practiced her occlumency to steady her emotions and manage her thoughts. Push the important ones to the back behind a mental wall and keep the ones that mean nothing in the front. If Voldemort was going to examine her mind, he would merely see Astoria shopping for books and listening to records in her room. Nothing about Draco and nothing about how she truly felt about the boy.She could feel her nerves beginning to rattle for she could barely keep a cigarette in her hand steady. It felt like ages before she was called in from the terrace. She braced herself for any outcome.When she walked back inside, she noticed the entire High Council was in the dining room and at the head of the table sat her Master, Voldemort."My Lord." She squeaked out but quickly kept her held high. Show strength and not an ounce of weakness. "I have called you here fo- ""To speak on behalf of Draco. Is that right?" Voldemort said while looking cold.Astoria pushed hair from her shoulder and could feel her hands beginning to sweat. No matter how much she calmed herself mentally, physically she was riddled with anxiety."My Lord. I am asking you to hear the truth, and perhaps you will see Draco's undying loyalty towards you and the council."Voldemort looks intrigued and rose his wand to flick a charm on a nearby chair for it to be pushed out for Astoria to sit. Voldemort's eyes moved from hers to the chair and Astoria slowly sat."You have my attention, my dear." Voldemort said.The rest of the council's eyes were on Astoria. She could feel their judgement on her, ready for her to fail. They were ready to see Draco tortured and have the Dark Lord's imprints on his skin, but Astoria was a Greengrass. Greengrass' never faltered when protecting the people, they cared for most."I ran away from Spinner's End. I felt I was in a jail cell for numerous weeks. I took it upon myself to slip away from Professor's Snape's protection. I was in Knockturn Alley, in trouble, Draco saved me. Then he..." She paused and began to fiddle with her necklace."Yes, my precious girl? What did Draco do then?" Voldemort inquired softy.As Astoria knew she had two options. The first being tell the whole truth to Voldemort about how Draco took her to a Porthcuno and shared his innermost thoughts. The second choice would be to lie. It was not wise to tell what may be a secret about the Malfoy safe house. Astoria gathered her thoughts, calmed her emotions and put her occlumency skill to work. Voldemort could sense a lie from anyone, especially his followers. She needed to put up the wall and appear numb."Draco... he... took me to the Leaky Cauldron. We sat in the corner and had a pint. I desperately needed to clear my head and Draco was kind enough to be there for me. Honestly, my Lord I was having unclear thoughts about my newly found journey and Draco put back on the right path." She paused and glared into Voldemort's eyes. "Without Draco I would not be here with you, my Lord. If I was still having those clouded thoughts, I'd probably be dead." She said lowly.Voldemort paused for a moment and rose from his seat. He lifted his wand and charmed every chair to pull out making the council fall on their backside."Leave us!" Voldemort whaled.Once the council left, the doors closed, and Voldemort stood behind Astoria's chair."The last thing I want... is for my precious girl... to have clouded thoughts." Voldemort paused and began to walk around her and the table."Astoria, I intend to keep you close when the time comes."Astoria reached to the back of her neck and began to feel the imprint of the rune. She quickly realized why her blood with boiling with power. It was the dark magic of the rune taking over her. The feeling of power rushing through her bones."My Lord. I belong to you. I am here eternally with you." Astoria rose and stood in front of Voldemort and turned around to show the rune. "You will never lose me."She felt her stomach begin to knot and her eyes begin to wander the room. Just as she was about to turn around, she felt Voldemort's finger graze the rune and lightly tap at it."I see it healed nicely." Voldemort said lowly.Astoria pulled her hair back down and turned around. "It did not take long. Nothing some essence of dittany cannot heal in a jiff."All that was on Astoria's mind was rushing out of the room and finding Draco. Where the hell was Draco being kept?"My Lord. If you will pardon me..." She said lowly."What is it my girl?" Voldemort inquired while taking a seat on the nearby armchair."I feel Draco should be rewarded for his service to me. He was able to clear my mind and make me feel proud of who I am."Voldemort sneered. "He is scheduled to receive the runes fairly soon, Astoria.""I know. Please. Consider his undying loyalty to you, my Lord. Draco's mind is looking to the future, your future. He deserves to be rewarded." Astoria pleaded.Anything was better than receiving the Dark Lord's runes and having his blood imprinted on your bones. She could not bear watching Draco be tortured as she was not that long ago."My dear Astoria. You have swayed my thinking." Voldemort said lowly."I shall only imprint one rune on him. Perhaps where yours is? Since you two are very close you will match..." Voldemort said with a snarky tone.Astoria felt herself going further and further into herself until she said the last thing she ever hoped to say."Give him the mark." She blurted out.Voldemort's eyes shot to Astoria and he furrowed his eyes toward her. He seemed shocked but confused.Voldemort snarked and rose quickly to stand in front of Astoria."The Dark Mark is only for those who have deemed themselves worthy to me." He said sternly while quirking his top lip."He is worthy. He saved my life. Grant him the mark." Astoria said boldly in Voldemort's face.The dark mark was Draco's last hope before the imprint ceremony. The dark mark was no picnic either, but it was better than Voldemort being imprinted in Draco's DNA. Astoria was trying everything in her power to sway Voldemort's mind.Voldemort was silent for a while. Pondering his next response. The longer his response lingered the more Astoria felt she convinced him to not perform the runes."Draco Malfoy will receive the Dark Mark tonight." Voldemort said lowly but then stood in front of her. "If he sways his loyalty my dear, I will kill him myself, and have you watch."Astoria felt herself swallow hard, but she stood her ground. She felt her feet frozen in place."He will deem it a great honor, my Lord." Astoria squeaked out while lowering her eyes to the floor, noticing Voldemort's bare feet."You are to leave. Return with Snape." Voldemort waved his wand and the door flung open. "Goodnight my dear."She walked out of the hall to find Snape standing stiff near the staircase. He immediately walked toward her and peered down at her."What have you done?" Snape said slowly."I saved Draco's life." Astoria said boldly while walking out of the Manor. When her and Snape reached the end of the walkway, she peered up to find a pale blond standing out in the balcony looking directly at her.She felt herself become heavy. She wanted nothing more but to hug Draco and tell him she saved him from the imprint ceremony and that he would not be tortured. All she could do was get one last glance before she saw him again at Hogwarts.The next two weeks felt like a year in Astoria's mind. She spent her days reading, playing records and do everything she usually did in her room. Occasionally, Snape would train her in potions to prepare her for sixth year potions. Snape would not be teaching potions this year; he would be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. She felt proud that Snape was granted the job he always desired.The day of departure finally arrived. Astoria packed up her trunk and made sure she left nothing behind in Snape's home. She was excited to see her friends again. She wrote to Lilla over the summer, but no response. She only received two letters from Pansy, but a few went unanswered. Astoria received no letters from Harry. She missed talking to Harry these days. He was her sense of comfort and grounding. He always knew if something was on her mind.Snape told Astoria was not to take the Hogwarts Express to the castle, but she would be traveling with him. She was okay with it since she was not too fond of train rides. Snape and Astoria apparated to Hogsmeade, and then to the castle.Astoria took her first step onto the grounds and she immediately felt at peace. Like her old self. It felt like the first time she saw the castle when she arrived with the Beaxubaton girls. When Astoria stepped into the Great Hall, she heard a familiar voice from behind her."Astoria?" It was Harry.Astoria's face lit up and she immediately hugged him, but he faltered. She noticed his face was not filled with much joy, if any."Harry!" She faltered releasing him. "Is something the matter?"Harry put his hands in his pockets and looked her in the eyes."I was not expecting you to come back to Hogwarts."Astoria was confused, what happened? Did Harry suddenly dislike her?"Not come back? I am sorry you have me confused." She said while scratching her head."Astoria. I have heard some things. Bad things. I think it is best if you keep your distance." Harry said while strolling past her.Then Astoria felt that ache in her heart, and the knot in her stomach all over again. She had her five minutes of peace and it was gone as quickly as it came. Now she had someone else who hated her. Someone whom she thought she was close friends with. Astoria was concerned with what Harry had heard about her. How could he hear anything? Then Astoria thought about what those girls said in Diagon Alley.Astoria fled to her dormitory and fell against the door with her hands in her hair. She felt her chest begin to burst and her lungs releasing oxygen. She cried out as hard as she could and bellowed out her emotions.Astoria sat against the door for merely an hour before she could compose herself.

    1996Astoria awoke to the feeling of her head being pushed with force by the door. She had given herself a panic attack, passed out against the dormitory door and Pansy was at the door.Astoria immediately rushed herself off the floor and sat on her nearby trunk, while rubbing the back of her head. Pansy busted the door open."What the bloody hell are you doing against the door, Astoria?" Pansy exclaimed."I'm sorry I was- I think I passed out." Astoria muttered.Pansy furrowed her brows and examined her friend. Pansy put her hand under Astoria's chin, lifting her head and realizing that Astoria's eyes were bloodshot."Care to tell me why it looks like you have been crying?"Astoria was in no emotional state to come clean to Pansy about everything she experienced over the summer. It was bad enough that people were spreading rumors about what happened the night in the Ministry, but now more than ever she did not want to think about what her life newly entailed."I was not crying. I just smoked a little too much muggle weed Lilla gave me. You know how that rubbish turns your eyes red." Astoria lied.After a few hours of unpacking and listening to how much Pansy enjoyed spending the summer in Paris with her family, the girls made their way for the dinner feast.When they sat at the Slytherin table Astoria was happy to see all her old friends. Lilla was back and already talking about how much she loathes her family. Blaise shared with the group how Pansy and him decided to end their union. Astoria was surprised by this news, since the last time she saw them together they were smitten. Theo was nowhere to be seen, per usual. One figure Astoria immediately noticed missing from the table was Draco. Perhaps he was arriving late, or he was with Theo drinking in the common room. A usual night activity the pair often partook in.Astoria, being the nosey-nancy she is, decided to ask the group about Malfoy's whereabouts."Where is Draco?" Astoria inquired while turning her head to face her friends."I'dunno. Best guess he is drinking with Nott in the dungeons." Blaise said."You're asking about Malfoy? Are we worried about poor daddy's boy?" Lilla said sarcastically while nudging Astoria playfully.Astoria cracked a slight smile and nudged her back while muttering "No.""If I know Draco, which I do, he is probably drinking fire whiskey and cursing up Hogwarts with Nott." Pansy exclaimed while biting into her steak.Astoria decided to drop the subject. She did not want the group to think she was smitten with Draco, which she was not. She was merely concerned for him, given his situation.The next morning Astoria strode to Herbology with Lilla. Before they entered the greenhouse, she made eye contact with Neville Longbottom. Astoria did not know him well, but he was a member of Dumbledore's Army. Astoria strode over to Neville and lightly touched his shoulder, causing him to jump."Hi Nev- "Astoria jumped as well when he did. "Oh- I am sorry. I did not mean to frighten you."Neville seemed frightened of the girl in front of him and took a step back."Hi-Hi Astoria... Erm-Excuse me." Neville strode away, taking a seat on the other side of the Greenhouse table.Astoria cocked her head and faced Lilla. She shrugged her shoulders and listened to Professor Sprout droll on and on about the proper way to toss gnomes out of a garden so they will not return.Astoria could not understand why Neville seemed to be afraid of her. He would not even come near her. Had the rumors become that bad that her peers feared her? Surely, people of the high council would not leak out her secret so soon. She put the thought to the back of her mind and continued her classes for the day.When classes concluded for the day Astoria decided to sit by the Black Lake and have a cigarette. She had to hide from the house prefects because they were always trying to take house points from students caught smoking on school grounds. It was usually always the Gryffindor prefects that caught her in the act.As Astoria was strolling toward the oak tree, she noticed a male figure sitting where she usually did. When she approached him further, she noticed it was Theodore Nott, he too was smoking a cigarette."Theo? Since when do you partake in bad habits?" Astoria said as she took a seat next to him.Theo glared up at Astoria and nodded at her with a cracked smile."Hey Tori. I dunno perhaps it is because of your constant bad habit I decided to partake in it myself." He said sarcastically.It was no secret to anyone that Astoria did smoke quite a bit. It was a drug to her, relieving of stress. Call it an addiction.Astoria placed the cigarette between her lips and muttered incendio. She took a long inhale, and watched the smoke fill the air with her exhale. Astoria still had not seen Draco yet. He did not show up to the first day of classes and he was not at the feast. Astoria was officially worried. What if the Dark Lord gave Draco the runes after all and he was too weak to attend school? When Astoria received her single rune, she was lying on her chest for four days because the pain was incarcerating."Theo were you with Draco last night?" Astoria said slowly while taking another drag.Theo turned his head to face Astoria for a moment and continued to smoke his own cigarette."I was not. I had not seen him until I found him passed out asleep in his bed. I was with some Ravenclaw last night." He let out a chuckle. "Some pre-term shagging never hurt anyone."Astoria and Theo let out a laugh in unison. She gave him a slight nudge and flicked her cigarette on the ground. She wrapped her arms around her legs and put her chin in between her knees. Draco never missed the dinner feast, and when he had he was usually drinking with Nott or Zabini. Astoria decided to shake it off because Draco Malfoy was not her concern. She was not attached to him. She concluded she was merely inquiring about her friend."Don't worry about him Tori. He is a strong one, but he is going through a lot right now." Theo said lowly while patting Astoria on the knee.Astoria glared out onto the Black Lake. She noticed how the sun rays were beaming across the water and the giant squid was flaring its tentacles above the water."I am not worried about him Theo. I barely know him." Astoria muttered while clutching her knees tighter and turning her head.She could hear Theo lighting another cigarette and adjusting his sitting position."Sure." He muttered under his breath.Astoria shot him a look and he smirked at her with intent. He knew something. Draco told him something, but how much had he told Theo. Draco was talking about Astoria to his friends. Did that mean he thought about her often? Did he care for her in a deeper manner? All these questions began to cloud inside Astoria's head.She walked into the common room with Theo to find Lilla and Pansy on the leather couches going over their potion's homework. The girls were astounded at the fact that Professor Slughorn assigned scrolls on the first day of term."This is absolutely rubbish." Lilla scoffed while tossing her quill.Astoria rolled her eyes and strolled up the stairs. Theo departed to the boy's dormitories and Astoria to the girls. She took a shower and washed off the scent of cigarette smoke. A most unpleasant scent on an aristocratic lady most would say.When Astoria stepped out of the shower, she went to pin her wet hair up and that is when she saw the rune on the back of her neck. She looked at it and sighed. Astoria grabbed her wand from the nearby table and muttered the disillusionment charm to hide the rune. The last thing she wanted was somebody to notice it and ask questions. Astoria pulled on a Slytherin green jumper and strode out of the dungeons. She was heading towards the owlery when she heard distress coming from one of the nearby men's loo. She crept behind the wall, heard the crying and torment become louder. She got closer and noticed blood dripping off one of the sinks and a tall, pale, blond man came into view.Astoria's mouth gaped open when she saw Draco Malfoy with a knife, and a cleaning brush in his hand. She noticed his left arm was seeped in blood and he was heaving for breath."Draco?" Astoria said lowly, taking one step toward him.His eyes shot to hers and they immediately filled with rage. She saw him grab his wand and point it at her, she did the same, but was not willing to hex him at any time."GET OUT" He roared at her.Astoria, not listening, strode forward, wand still raised but proceeded with caution. She was unsure what Draco was doing but knew it was not pleasant. This was the first time she had seen him in weeks, and he looked almost ill. His eyes were sunken in, black circles lined his under eye and his forehead was dripping with perspiration."Draco... lower your wand... just... tell me what it is you are doing..." Astoria said lowly while still walking toward.Draco with a knife clutched in one hand and his wand in the other lunged forward at her, causing Astoria to jolt backward almost losing her footing."CAN'T YOU EVER DO AS YOU ARE TOLD!" Draco yelled in her face. His voice sounded cruel, but it was underlined with hurt. Astoria could see in his face that his mask was being torn off and his heart was aching.Astoria touched the tip of his wand attempting too physically lower it herself. Before she knew it she was shoved against the wall causing her to lose her breath. Malfoy shoved her against the wall and showed no mercy."Are you mental!" Astoria yelled out lunging forward at him.Draco lowered his head and began to clutch the bloody sink in front of him. When she approached him and touched the back of his shoulder he jolted around and grabbed her by the scalp and pushed her backward again.Astoria was filled with rage. She could feel her blood boiling like lava. How dare he shove her and push her away. She was trying to assist his bloody arse. Astoria could not stop herself, she strode forward, and turned him around causing him to face her."If you ever fucking- "She shoved his body against the sink. "SHOVE me again... you will regret it, Malfoy!" She roared in his face and turned on her heel.She no longer cared that his arm was cut up and dripping blood. He shoved her against a wall and showed no mercy. Why should she show mercy to a cold-blooded arse like Draco Malfoy?As she was almost out of the boy's lavatory, she heard him speak."For a woman who is merely 5'1 you have some force to your shove." He croaked out.That was it? That was all he had to say to her. Bullocks."Bite me." Astoria spat.Malfoy rose an eyebrow and rubbed his nose. "Tell me where." He murmured.Astoria blinked a few times and was astonished by what he was saying. She had never heard him say anything remotely like that toward her. She knew Draco shagged many Slytherin and Ravenclaw girls, but he never muttered words like that to Astoria. It was always, "You're a whore" or "No. We cannot. We should not." Sayings Astoria was tired of hearing.Astoria rolled her eyes and began to stare at his blood covered arm."Are you going to tell me why you are covered in blood?"Drago shrugged and finally set down the knife on the sink."Maybe I was going to mail the blood home and stain my parents marble flooring."Astoria bit her bottom lip and knew what he was referring too. His parents must have told him what happen when she showed up at his house. She threatened to slit her wrists on the marble floor and leave her body for Voldemort to find. She was slightly annoyed Draco threw that back in her face."It would certainly give Malfoy Manor some character and much needed color." Astoria said lowly.She walked over to him slowly and peered down at his arm. She finally noticed it. The blood had cleared mostly, and she saw the infamous Dark Mark. Voldemort kept his word and gave Draco the dark mark in place of the runes. In some ways she felt relived but looking at Draco's current condition she was consumed with guilt. She wondered if he knew she was reason he received the dark mark."You were trying to cut it out..." Astoria muttered while grazing the teared skin with her thumb. She then glared over to the brush soaked in blood and cocked her head."Erm—what is this for?" She held up the brush.Draco lowly let out a pathetic laugh. "Attempted to scrub it off with as much force as I possibly had. When that was not working, I got frustrated. I grabbed the blade I keep in my trousers and I just kept peeling skin."Astoria furrowed her brows and tried not to conjure up the pictures in her head of Draco slicing his forearm skin to bits. Astoria grabbed her wand and became to mutter simple healing charms. Before their eyes, the skin was reattaching itself and the dark mark remained in-tact. Astoria gave Draco a low smile."I'm sorry." She said while glaring down at his arm.He took her chin to meet her eyes. His eyes grey and stormy. His touch firm but gentle. She missed seeing his haunted eyes, his masculine touch. She also took notice he looked quite attractive in his Slytherin robes. She always saw him in his black suit, but she forgot what he looked like as a normal school boy."It is not your fault. It was bound to happen." Draco said lowly.She was consumed with guilt because Draco did not know it was Astoria's fault, he had the dark mark. She made the deal with Voldemort, she pleaded for Draco to receive the mark.Astoria went to bed that night with clouded thoughts. Her mind would not turn off. Every time she tossed and turned; she saw Draco's bloody arm split open. Then the thoughts of the rumors going around about her identity kept her eyes focused on the ceiling. Then the final dark thought about Harry not wanting to talk to her anymore. This made her heart ache since she became close with Harry last year. She knew eventually he would turn on her once he realized who she was, but Astoria did not realize it would happen so quick. Then she wondered if the rest of her friends found out who she was, will she still have friends? Will they be so repulsed by her that they cannot stand to be near her.A few days had passed and Astoria decided since seeing Malfoy attempting to cut out the dark mark he needed protection. She went to one of the only people she could trust in Hogwarts. Professor Snape. Since Snape was no longer the potions instructor, his office had been recently moved near closer to the library. Astoria strode over to the door and gave it a short knock. Immediately, the door swung open and revealed Snape sitting at his desk reading over scrolls."What is it Miss. Greengrass?" He said sternly.Astoria walked in and shut the door behind her. She took a seat in front of his desk and cleared her throat."I need to ask something of you." She said lowly."Everyone always wants something." Snape murmured while continuing to grade the scrolls in front of him.Astoria bit her lip and sat forward. "Draco attempted to cut out his dark mark." She blurted out.Snape put down the scrolls and finally made eye contact wit her. He furrowed his brows and quickly rose from his seat."You're certain of this?"Astoria nodded her head. "Positive. I healed the wound myself."Snape began to pace in his steps for a couple of minutes before turning on his heel and facing Astoria."And... what is it you need from me?"Astoria took a breath and crossed her legs, sitting back."I need you to monitor him. I fear for his well-being."Snape snorted and took his seat back behind his desk. "I do not have time to monitor a schoolboy, Miss. Greengrass. Now if you please-"Snape waved his wand opening the door to his office in hopes Astoria would leave his presence.However, she was not budging."Now that he obtains the mark, He considers him loyal. I intend to make sure He does no further harm to him." Astoria said boldly.She was not going to watch Draco nearly dismember himself over something she caused."Miss. Greengrass as it appears Mr. Malfoy is already under protection. No need to worry your head. As a matter of fact, the Dark Lord regards Draco in high esteem which is why he is assigned with a task this term."A task? What task? Astoria had not heard about this. It was not discussed with her Master. Hopefully, it was to steal something minor or obtain information. If Draco were smart, he would complete the task as soon as he is able and please the Dark Lord."Task?" Astoria said sharply while furrowing her brows."None of your concern Miss. Greengrass. Now if you please- "Snape pointed at the door and Astoria made her exit.Now Astoria needed to figure out what the Dark Lord tasked Draco with. She knew Draco well enough that if she asked, he would lie. Perhaps in due time he will open up to her more. Their friendship was developing quite nicely Astoria thought. Healing his arm should count for something, or so she hoped.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Astoria stood by the Black Lake in a mixed of emotions. All at once she felt bold, scared, curious and another emotion she could not quite fathom. She walked out onto the nearby dock and conjured herself a canvas. She needed to explain to herself what she was feeling. Her brush would always guide her thoughts along the blank canvas.Astoria, with her paints in hand, her brush between her teeth, stared at the white board in front of her. She glared at the edges and thought, "Where to begin?" She dipped her brush in a grey color and began to sway across the canvas.After several attempts to quit, quick glances at the giant squid and almost throwing the canvas into the black later, Astoria finally finished. It had been the first painting she produced in months and she felt her emotions steady.When Astoria was younger her mother would paint portraits of young women. She told her, "A woman's body is of the uttermost beauty, and with enough hope, the uttermost confidence." Astoria desired to paint as her mother. To only see the beauty of what lied before her. However, Astoria painted what she felt in the moment. Her art always reflected her emotion. If her head was clouded her paintings were grey, blue and black. If she was elated, her paintings entailed lots of blues and yellows.Astoria took a step back and regarded her creation. It was of a landscape of a place she had never been with the sun peaking through the grey clouds. She could see the village peering through the side of the bridge. It looked like a small town that would stay hidden beneath the stars and clouds in the countryside of England. No one bothers them. A peaceful town where everyone knows one another. A solace place to paint everyday on the bridge with the sun beaming down. As Astoria looked at the painting more, she grew angry with thinking about possibilities of where she could live. She needed desperately to stop daydreaming of how she wanted her life to be. As she grabbed hold of the canvas to dispose of it in the like she heard someone speak from behind her. As she grabbed hold of the canvas to dispose of it in the like she heard someone speak from behind her"That looks nice."Malfoy must have crept up behind her when she was thinking to herself and not worry about the rest of the world. She set the canvas back on the easel and let out a low chuckle."Merci." She let out another low laugh, and she spoke is a comedic French accent. "My work is quite extraordinaire." She said in a comedic friend accent. "Don't you agree?"Malfoy walked past her and took another long look at the painting. He held up his thumb to "size" the positioning of some of the objects, but it was apparent he had no idea what he was doing."I think it looks divine. Is this the first time you painted something in a while?" He inquired lowly.Astoria nodded and peered toward her creation. "It is. The sun was shining at just the right moment when I had the urge to spill out all my emotion onto a blank canvas.""Ahhh-you are one of those painters." He said while quirking an eyebrow and smirking.She nudged him playfully. "Bastard."She flicked her wand and the canvas and easel shrunk to size to fit into her small satchel draped across her chest. The sun was going to set soon, and the dinner feast was about to commence."We should get back to the Great Hall." The couple began to walk up the hill until a question struck Astoria. "How is your arm...?"Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks and pulled up his sleeve. There she saw it again the dark mark imprinted on his forearm skin. Thankfully, this time his skin was molded back together thanks to Astoria's healing charm. She poked it slightly with her finger and peered up at Malfoy."Would you like me to cast a disillusionment charm on it? It works. I use it every day on the... thing... on the back of my neck." As Astoria said that she lifted her hair to show Malfoy the invisible rune that lays on the back of her neck."It will not work. I have tried and it..."Without another word Astoria muttered the charm under her breath and noticed the white cast covering the mark and when it was cleared all one could see was his beautiful pale skin."Voila!" Astoria said boldly.Draco's face looked astonished and she saw a smile crack from his mouth. Her eyes met his and it looked as his he could breathe with ease. He lifted his hand to graze his thumb across her jawline."Sometimes I forget who you are." He said lowly."I wish I could say the same for myself." She said while holding his hand against her face. Their eyes not breaking the gaze.She wanted nothing more to pull him in and kiss his soft lips. Her heartbeat began to fasten, and her head was beginning to think a million times faster. She found that her eyes were locked on his mouth, but he was hesitant. She felt him beginning to falter until she pulled hold of his shirt and pulled him in, smashing her lips onto his.She felt his hands wrap around her lower body and her hands cupped his jawline. Her tongue began to slither into her mouth and danced with hers. She heard the low grunts Draco was letting out every few seconds.Draco bit the bottom of her lip, causing her to whimper softy against his mouth. Her hair was gripped between his fingers causing her to arch herself onto him. With every movement she felt him becoming more rigid.As quickly as the kiss came it ended. Draco jolted back and wiped his lips clean, leaving Astoria gasping for breath."No. We cannot. This is wrong. Do you realize he will kill me if he finds out that I am involved with his 'precious one?'" Draco scoffed and began to curse under his breath.Astoria did not know what to say. She and Draco have shared kisses in the past, but he has never broken one for the sake of the Dark Lord. She was worried that was the last kiss they would ever share. The last time she would feel his hands in her hair, or on her body.Astoria felt her eyes beginning to pool every time she looked at Draco. He looked frustrated, sad, angry and filled with regret. She could tell his feelings toward her were confused and she was not going to figure anything out at this moment. Astoria wiped her face clean and nodded."Come on. They will all be waiting for us for dinner." She began to walk up the hill without him causing him to fall behind.She took a seat next to Lilla and her friend noticed her facial expression immediately. Lilla knew Astoria inside and out. She knew her different facial expressions or when she was quiet."Tori? What is going on?" Lilla said quietly so the group would not hear.But then Astoria's gaze met Malfoy as he entered the hall and took a seat at the Slytherin table next to Theo. He met her eyes for a split second and began to eat his dinner."I am perfectly well. I was just outside painting and the finished product brought tears to my eyes. It was a personal piece." Astoria lied partially. She could not tell anyone about her kiss with Draco. It would only complicate things.Lilla knew Astoria was lying she peered at Draco and back at Astoria. She nodded slowly and quirked an eyebrow. Astoria felt Lilla squeeze her knee and continue eating.Astoria felt inside her head during the entire feast. She heard the conversations going on around but was failing to contribute. Then she heard Pansy loud and clear."It is Friday! I have a brand-new bottle of fire whiskey that needs the seal to be broken. Anyone up for some shots and games?"The group all agreed and after dinner they strolled down into the dungeons to the Slytherin common room. There was barely anyone mingling inside so the group took over the floor side near the fireplace. Even though it was warm outside, down in the dungeons there was always a damp air lingering.Pansy poured everyone a shot and held her glass up for a toast."To the best mother-fuckers I have ever met. Happy Sixth Year!" Pansy exclaimed proudly.Theo, Lilla, Draco, Pansy, Astoria, and Blaise all clinked their glasses and down their shots. An hour or two went by and the shots flowed thoroughly. Astoria's eyes began to fool her as things around the common room began to dance. She felt she was giggling to herself."Okay everyone sits in a circle. It is time to get freaky." Pansy said with a sinister smile.Astoria cocked her head and wondered what she was intending on doing with an empty glass bottle. She clutched the fire whiskey in her hand and downed another shot causing her to almost fall over. Astoria had not felt drunk since last term, so she was going to enjoy every moment."Okay... so what you do is... spin the bottle and whomever it lands on the spinner kisses. Make sense?" Pansy explained while making eye contact with everyone."If I wanted to share spit with Lilla she only needs to ask." Theo said boldly while winking at Lilla.Then Lilla raised a middle finger and a smirked toward Theo. Astoria always felt Lilla had a slight crush on Theo ever since she saw them dancing together at the pub one night."I am going first!" Lilla exclaimed.She spun the bottle and it landed on Zabini. Lilla crossed the way and smashed her lips against Blaise's. Astoria noticed Pansy turn her head. Her and Blaise had only just broken up so she must be feeling uncomfortable."Nice tongue Zabini never knew you had it in you." Lilla exclaimed."I did!" Astoria shot out with a laugh.At that moment she noticed Draco's eyes fixed on hers. It felt ages ago that she kissed Blaise. It was in the past, but perhaps Draco never found out about it. It was Astoria's turn to spin the bottle. She let out a soft giggle and it landed on Theo.Astoria shrugged her shoulders and strode over on her knees to Theo. Theo cupped her face and pulled her in softly. She could hear Pansy gasping and saying, "Get a room!" Theo had slipped his tongue into Astoria mouth and began to massage his with hers. Astoria felt herself slipping so she broke the kiss and wiped her lips.She swallowed hard and looked into his eyes. He had a smirk on his face. She never imagined kissing Theo, but it felt nice. She must have been blushing because her cheeks were on fire.Just as she sat back in her spot, she glanced at Draco who looked as if he was going to punch Theo's nose into his skull. Then his eyes were filled with rage toward hers. He told her he could not, that they should not be doing what they do anymore. Did he expect her to only have that one last kiss forever? Bollocks.She felt Lilla's eyes on hers and she made eye contact with her friend. Lilla looked slightly upset and then she downed another shot."I will go next!" Pansy said loudly.Pansy took hold of the bottle and spun it with intent. Astoria watched the bottle intently and saw how it landed on Draco. Pansy looked more than pleased it landed on him."Just do it." Draco muttered looking slightly disgusted, but it was merely a game.Pansy strode over on her knees and cupped Draco's face. Their lips were connected and then she noticed Draco's hand grip her lower back. Pansy began to sit on top of him and deepen the kiss.Astoria felt herself fill with rage. She wanted nothing more than to grab Pansy by the hair and smash her against the couch. Lilla must have noticed the Astoria's raged filled expression because she nudged her. Astoria would not take her eyes off the couple.Pansy let go of him for a moment only to say."Goodnight perverts." Pansy said before connecting their lips again and arching her back onto him.Lilla took Astoria by the hand and they went up the stairs. She stood at the top of the spiral staircase and watched. Draco made no attempt in stopping what Pansy was doing. She saw her hands all over his face, then chest, and then guiding his hands against her body. Astoria could not bring herself to cry because it was not sadness she was feeling, but it was betrayal. Draco and Astoria were not officially together but she thought they had a strange arrangement. Do not fuck other people.She noticed Blaise and Theo return to their chambers muttering, "Lucky bastard." And "Of course he is the only who gets laid tonight."Lilla tried to tug Astoria out of the view of Pansy and Draco, but she would not budge.Lilla crouched down and whispered to her, "Tori. Come on. This is not good for you to see."Astoria shrugged Lilla's hand away from her. "Bug off, Lilla."Lilla walked away and Astoria sat in silence for a little while longer.She watched Pansy guide Draco to the couch, and she sat on top of him. Grinding herself against him. She noticed his hands grasped around her backside and her hair. Pansy began to unbutton his shirt and Astoria felt herself becoming more embarrassed with herself. She should not be watching this, but it felt like a car crash. Not good to watch but you cannot take your eyes off it.Pansy took off her shirt and threw it across the room. She cupped his face and smashed their lips. She heard Pansy letting out pathetic whimpers. Pansy was her friend but at this moment she wanted nothing more but to feed her to the giant squid. Astoria felt guilty because Pansy did not know what Draco meant to her or what they shared.Draco lifted Pansy and placed her against the wall, almost facing Astoria, her legs wrapped around his torso. She watched Pansy bury herself in his neck. Just as Astoria was about to get up and leave the situation, she lost her footing and made a quiet noise causing Draco's eyes to wander up the staircase. She met his eyes for a moment, and she noticed his face fall. She furrowed her brows at him and then left, breaking his gaze.Astoria was tossing and turning for hours it seemed before she heard Pansy return to the dormitory. She heard a drunk Pansy waddle in and plop down in Astoria's bed. She seemed so happy and Astoria felt so enraged but filled with guilt."Pans- finaalllyyy- got laid again..." Pansy exclaimed while hugging Astoria.Astoria knew Pansy was drunk and hopefully she will not remember what she did next. She shoved Pansy off the bed making her face hit the floor. She showed no remorse and Pansy slept on the floor that night.Astoria finally fell asleep and was infuriated by the entire situation. She did not want to see Pansy or Draco for a while. Especially, Draco. He even saw her watching and he continued to sleep with Pansy. Perhaps he felt hurt when she kissed Theo? But that does not matter. She had not slept with Theo and Draco had shagged Pansy.Astoria was done protecting Draco. He is a man, and he can make his own decisions, clearly. Astoria decided to focus on the term and get as much freedom time in as possible before the term was over. She felt herself fiddle with her emerald necklace and just one single hot tear streamed down her face.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Astoria kept to herself for the next few days after the, quite eventful, spin-the-bottle night. She quickly realized she had no grounds to be angry at Pansy or Draco. What Draco and Astoria shared was a friendship based off similar traumatic experiences. Their fondness of one another was based off them comparing scars.When Astoria in France she was quite fond of reading research muggle studies on psychology and relationship development. Madame Maxime told her it was meaningless study work because people who could do magic can easily hear peoples thoughts. Astoria thought differently. She was intrigued with why people chose to hurt people and why some people collide while others sever. Before she left France, Astoria read a study about couples falling in love while going through similar struggles. The man and the woman would have deep intimate conversations and compare their hardships. Overtime, a bond would create, and they would not want to be without the other person, resulting in a union. Astoria chalked up that this is what hers and Draco's relationship was, except they got to the point of a union. Overtime, the desire to be with him would fade and she would learn to not need him as a safety net.Astoria took her seat in potions class and quickly Pansy sat next her. From Pansy's perspective, Astoria was acting as herself and nothing was wrong. From Astoria's perspective, Pansy shagged the guy she fancied, but could not confront her because Draco and she were not officially together. A stressful situation, but Astoria just kept slightly quiet and listened to Professor Slughorn.Astoria happen to notice that Draco was paired up with Hermione Granger. It seemed odd because he would talk about how he despises mudbloods and how much he had hoped that she would pitch herself off the astronomy tower. She thought nothing of it and continued to brew her potion. Just as she was about to cut some aconite Pansy leaned in toward her."Psst- Tor. Do you think I could borrow your green cocktail dress?"Astoria thought about the uses Pansy needed for a cocktail dress but then an explanation came into her head that she did not want to think about."I need it for tonight. Draco and I are heading into London for the night. You do not mind, do you?" Pansy asked lowly.She most certainly did mind, but maybe this would be a good thing. Draco becomes smitten with Pansy and Astoria can come to terms that it was never meant to be.Astoria shook her head casually and gave her friend a small crack of a smile. But she wanted to say, "NO NO NO. Back the fuck up." But she stayed quiet for the rest of the class.Astoria decided to skip her last class of the day and go sit at her favorite oak tree by the Black Lake. She leaned her head back against the tree, closed her eyes and breathed in the crisp air. It would be getting cold real soon so she wanted to soak up as much time in the warmer air as Astoria could.As she felt herself slowly drifting off, she felt someone plop down next to her and nudge her slightly. It was Theo coming over for a smoke."Hey there hot lips." He said playfully with a chuckle.Astoria was glad to see him. Theo was becoming a friend she never had to worry about. He was always there to listen too (about her non-dark problems), and he was a good shoulder to cry on when needed."Hey..." She said lowly."Tell Theo what's wrong, love. You do not seem your usual outspoken bitch self." Theo said while taking a puff."It is so much, and it is nothing all at the same time."Theo looked at her with intent and offered her a cigarette, Astoria accepted and lit the tip. She took an inhale and felt the tobacco smoke fill her lungs."Want to know what I think?"Astoria nodded and shrugged her shoulders. Theo stood up and kneeled down in front of her. Looking at her directly, pointing his cigarette at her."You are smitten with Malfoy aren'tcha?" Theo cracked a smile and Astoria's eyes rolled. "Come on Tori. Everyone can see it. When Pansy basically mauled him the other night you looked as if you were ready to shoot a curse at her or him."Astoria lent her head back, breaking the eye contact and scoffed."Theo, it is more complicated than that. Draco is my friend and Pansy is my best friend, if they want to fuck each other that is their damn right." Astoria spat out.She felt sick letting those words roll off her tongue. She felt weak and defeated. Usually, she was the one causing the distress not the other way around. But in the end Astoria always feel she is the one left behind."Draco knows he cannot have you, Astoria. Do you realize that?" Theo muttered while re-placing the cigarette between his lips.Astoria was trying to figure what Theo meant by that. Then she became worried that Theo knew who she was, but right now she was tired of lying. She could not the next thing she said it came out of her mouth like wildfire."YOU THINK I DO NOT REALIZE THAT!" Astoria whaled out, rising to her feet. She snapped back to reality and calmed herself. "I do not think YOU understand what you are talking about, Theo. Draco and I cannot be, I realize that, but do you know WHY?" She felt her insides exploding. Her guilt rising to the surface."Because he has the dark mark." Theo said lowly.Astoria scoffed and nodded. The dark mark was nothing compared to what she has on the back of her neck. She was tired of not having another person know of her true identity, even if it was evil. Draco was no longer her ally, someone for her to confide in. Perhaps Theo could be."His dark mark is bollocks compared to what I have." She spat out.Theo cocked his head and furrowed his brows. Astoria rolled her eyes and met his gaze."Ever hear of the legend of the Dark Lord Unborn Property?"Theo nodded, pondered for a minute and then his eyes quickly bulged from his head. He was finally putting the pieces together. He hesitated for a moment but then took a seat next to her."Does Draco know?" He inquired."Of course, he does. He found out this summer. But... he does not know that... erm... I was the reason he obtained the dark mark."Theo eyes bulged and he leaned in closer. Astoria explained what happen in Spinner's End, when she left, when Draco found her and what happened in Porthcurno. She mostly important explained why she had to plead with the Master for Draco to receive the dark mark."Theo, the Dark Lord was going to give Draco blood imprinted runes on his skin. I have one just like it on the back of neck. I did not want Draco to go through his life knowing the Dark Lord's blood is running through his veins and is infused in his bones." Astoria felt her eyes begin to pool but she took a deep inhale.Theo was silent for a few minutes, and then he put his arm around her in comfort. It felt like ages of silence, but finally he responded."You saved him, Tori." He muttered.Astoria scoffed and rolled her eyes."No, I did not. I merely re-fashioned his handcuffs."Astoria firmly believed that. Just another form of a ball-in chain to the Dark Lord she fashioned for Draco."He cares about you a lot, Astoria. When him and I are drinking he will not shut up about how much he'd like to—erm... you know." She let out a chuckle. "He thinks you are the most gorgeous creature to walk this Earth.""If he thinks of me so, why not come out and tell me?" She inquired sarcastically.Theo shrugged. "You know how he is. It is like reading a book, except each chapter of him is locked with a different key. Only he can supply the key to his chapters."Astoria walked back to her dorm room feeling numb, but also a slight weight off her shoulder. One of her friends knew her identity, so now she had someone new to confide in. When she walked in Pansy was wearing a black laced bra, with matching underwear. She was obviously planning on shagging tonight."What do you think? Would you hit this?" Pansy inquired while regarding herself in the mirror."Yeah, I would..." She breathed. "with a baseball bat." She whispered to herself. Pansy asked her what she said, and Astoria brushed off the question."Can I please borrow your green dress? Draco's favorite color is emerald, and I want to look exquisite."Astoria handed Pansy her dress and gave her a short smile."How do you feel about Malfoy? I am surprised you two are going out, by what I saw it seemed to be a one-night stand..." Astoria said while sitting on her bed.Pansy slipped the dress on and adjusted it properly. Astoria thought she looked better in her own dress, but she was not going to tell her friend that. Pansy had her hair straight down, with a pair of snake earrings, followed by a black diamond necklace almost touching her cleavage line."Oh goodness... I have fancied Draco since third year! I am beyond excited for tonight and between you and I..." Pansy leaned in to whisper. "He is fabulous in the sack." Pansy winked at Astoria.The thought of Pansy fucking Malfoy gave Astoria a knot in her stomach. A situation she did not want to think of. Astoria wanted to feel happy for her friend, that she was going out with a man she fancied, just not this one."Have a good time." Astoria said while hugging Pansy goodbye.Astoria decided she wanted to spend the night with Lilla in her dorm. She walked out of the door to find Draco waiting for Pansy. She must have stepped into the powder room for one last touch-up. Draco looked divine. He was dressed in his usual black suit, tie, with a hint of green from his pocket square. Astoria felt her chest swell as she was taken aback by him standing there.They made eye contact and it looked as if he wanted to say something to her, but all Astoria could manage to say was, "Have a bloody goodnight" with a tight sarcastic smile. She hauled herself into Lilla's dorm.She fell against the door and felt the tears fall on her cheeks."Oh honey..." Lilla said as she embraced her best friend.Astoria felt herself cry into Lilla's shoulder for a while. Lilla did not mind comforting, she enjoyed being needed. Lilla never had a great relationship with her family, so her closest friends became her family. Astoria was like a sister to Lilla.Astoria heaved and cried harder. It all came pouring out while someone was holding her tight."I know... I know... it's okay... shh. Tori... shhh." Lilla said lowly while stroking Astoria's head.After some hours of heartfelt conversation, reassurance and some light muggle weed smoking. Lilla discussed how she received a letter from her parents that day."My parents are having their annual masquerade ball for Halloween. I am inviting everyone, so I am not bored to death. I am planning on getting as high as possible before it commences. It is the only way I am going to make it!"Astoria got excited. A party to look forward too. She had not attended a formal party in ages and during these events were a time for her to shine."Are you going to ask Theo to escort you?" Astoria asked as she gave her friend a wink. Lilla blushed slightly but then her facial expression fell. "Oh-come on I am sure he would say yes! I know you fancy him.""No, I cannot have an escort. I erm—am already going to be escorted." Lilla said lowly while taking a sip from her wine."Who are you going with?"Lilla eyes began to wander, and she seemed a bit anxious. "Oh-you will see..."Astoria felt this was strange. Obviously, Draco was not going to escort her to the party if he is shagging Pansy so perhaps Theo would escort Astoria.Lilla gave the good news of the party the next day at breakfast. Pansy instantly shot next to Draco and started discussing their costume coordination. Draco looked as if he would rather stab his eye out with a fork. Blaise explained that he could not leave that he was too busy with his studies. Astoria leaned forward and asked Theo if he wanted to go with her.Draco's eyes shot to Theo and then at Astoria. Waiting for what Theo would say next."I would be happy to accompany you Miss. Greengrass." Theo said formally while grasping Astoria's hand and placing a playful kiss.Astoria glanced over to Draco and his veins were protruding from his neck. She gave him a smirk and an eyebrow raise, then continued to eat her bacon.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Halloween night was finally here. Pumpkins lined the hallways of the castle and the great hall. First years were high on sugar and causing commotion in the hallways. It became official that Pansy was starting to fall in love with Draco. It was obvious. She talked about him constantly, her eyes lit up when she did. She would kiss him before she went into her classes, and he would be there for her when she was done. Astoria concluded that he forgotten about her and pushed her out of his mind. He belonged to Pansy now and Astoria needed to come to terms with it.Astoria never hinted at ever fancying Draco, but she kept her emotions hidden quite well. Thanks to her trained occlumency she was able to appear happy for her friend who was falling in love, with the man she cared for most.Tonight, was the Halloween masquerade party at Lilla's family estate and Astoria's nerves were leaping from her skin. She would be escorted by Theo for the night and she was relieved she had someone she could trust to lean on. Theo knew the situation between her and Malfoy so if she needed saving Theo will swoop in.Lilla left the day before to assist her family with the party preparations, and she also mentioned that her family had pressing matters to discuss with her. Astoria was sure she would get the full scoop when she saw Lilla the following night at the party.At breakfast Pansy was drawing on about how beautiful her dress was and how stoked she was to be attending a masquerade. Astoria looked at Draco and he looked like he wanted to shove a potato in her mouth to make her shut up. Astoria could not fathom why Draco always looked so disgusted every time Pansy opened her mouth. He has been "seeing" Pansy for several weeks now and everything seemed off kilter.It was not Astoria's concern. She needed to focus on her own costume and Theo's."Are you excited Tori? You and Theo are going to look so adorable walking in together." Pansy inquired cheerfully. Poor Pansy was so in the dark with everything that was happening with Astoria she almost felt sorry for her. A passing thought."Quite, and yes we will. Won't we Theo?" Astoria asked coolly while glaring at Nott."Are you mental? We are going to be the best-looking pair there!" Theo exclaimed loudly causing Astoria to let out a laugh. Theo gave her a small wink and she continued to eat her bacon.A few hours later and it was time to dress and portkey to the Dubois Estate. Pansy was starting to put on her dress when she called out for Astoria to help her. Astoria was in the bathroom regarding herself. At the last formal party, she attended she wore a fire red, diamond filled dress with a low back. This time she was planning on looking more striking than ever. Astoria's dress was an emerald green satin long hemmed dress, with a low-cut neckline and an open back. She finished up the last touches to her makeup and strutted out of the loo to notice Pansy struggling.Pansy glared at Astoria and smiled. Astoria gave her a warm smile and a tiny shrug.Pansy walked over to Astoria and placed her hands on her shoulders, glaring into her eyes. "You look gorgeous, Tori. Theo is going to bust himself just looking at you." She stated while giving a wink.Astoria zipped up Pansy's black colored dress and told her she looked beautiful as well. Theo and Draco were waiting for the girls in the common room while they finished dressing. The girls grabbed both their masquerade masks and walked out the door. Pansy had forgotten to grab the portkey and scurried back inside the dorm for awhile leaving Astoria to walk down the staircase and face the boys first, alone.When she crept out and peered over the top stairs, she saw both boys waiting at the bottom. Astoria began to ascend down the stairs and all she heard was pure silence. When she got to the bottom, she met Draco's eyes. His eyes fixed on hers. She felt her breath begin to slow and her heart rate begin to increase. Draco looked outstanding in his suit with a dark green tie. Just as she was about to break eye contact, she noticed he let out a long exhale and gave her a cracked smile. She broke the gaze and saw Theo."You look absolutely amazing..." Theo said. "Give us a turn!" Theo said while holding Astoria's hand. Her hair flipped enough to expose the back of her neck and then the boys saw the infamous rune on her neck.Draco immediately stepped forward and covered her neck. "You forgot to erm-charm it." Draco said lowly while being inches from her face.Astoria's hand immediately flung to the back of her neck and ran to a nearby mirror. She heard Pansy begin to ascend the stairs. She made the quick decision not to cover it.She whispered to the boys. "We all have scars that tell a story." She said lowly whilst giving them a wink.Pansy ascended down the stairs and immediately grabbed Draco by the arm. His face that was once joyful was washed away when Pansy took him by the arm. It was time to attend the masquerade. Pansy put the empty fire whiskey bottle portkey in the middle of the room."Of course, she made the portkey a liquor bottle..." Draco muttered.The group all took hold of the bottle and counted off. Before Astoria knew it they were spinning in the air, and had to let go to drop in front of the estate. They all had to kick their legs to land safely on the ground, but Theo ended up smashing his body onto the Earth."You alright, mate?" Draco inquired while giving his friend a hand.Pansy began to tie her mask and so did Astoria. She turned to face the estate and it was a large manor, with a long pathway. The inside sounded like an orchestra was playing and there was a doorman in the front. Astoria knew Lilla's parents were aristocrats but not to this extent. Even in the Wizarding world people do not host parties this fancy anymore.Astoria was finding herself staring at Draco and Pansy. She noticed Pansy rubbing her fingers while entwined with his, and his hand on her lower back to guide her forward. Astoria wanted nothing more than to pitch one of them into the nearby pond. The group was entering the hall when Astoria gripped onto Theo's arm and whispered."I am not sure if I can do this..." Astoria muttered while taking a pause.Theo leaned over and whispered in her ear. "You can do this. Keep your head up and be confident."Theo's words were comforting, with everyday passing he was becoming a greater friend then she ever knew. The orchestra music filled the air, floating trays of champagne and hors d'oeurve's. Every female had on a proper formal dress followed by a detailed mask. All men were dressed in tuxedos or suits followed by a plain black mask. Astoria's eyes kept flitting to the champagne and the tray finally made its way over to her with enough time for her to snag a glass. She downed it in one gulp."Thirsty?" Theo said sarcastically."Bug off. I need liquid courage to get through seeing Mr. and Mrs. Pansy Parkinson tonight." Astoria said sarcastically.Theo nodded and took a glass of champagne as well. The couple trapsed into the formal dance floor to notice couples dancing the Viennese waltz. Astoria's father taught her to ballroom dance at a very young age due to her aristocratic title and her family being part of the sacred twenty-eight. Astoria's parents would often gussy-up and attend gorgeous parties, but Daphne and Astoria were never invited. They would also get a good look at her mothers' beautiful gown and admire how she sparkled.When Astoria turned around, she finally saw Lilla and her parents. They were standing towards the front of the room and Lilla had a strange man standing beside her. That must be who is accompanying her tonight. Theo and Astoria strutted over to greet the Dubois'.Lilla spotted Astoria and embraced her tightly while whispering into her ear. "Thank merlin, you are here..."Astoria gave her a tight smile and her eyes were fixed on the dark-haired man standing behind Lilla. He seemed to be hovering. Lilla looked down and took a deep breath."Tori, Theo I would like you two to meet Antonin Dolohov."Theo shook the man's hand and exchanged a casual greeting. Then Lilla went to speak again."He is my erm—we are--..." Lilla could not bring herself to force the words from her mouth, she looked as if she were going to vomit."Miss. Dubois and I are to be married." Dolohov interjected.Astoria's mouth almost hit the floor. Since when was Lilla dating someone? This man seemed at least ten years older than her. Ever since Astoria met Lilla, she swore off marriage and said it was crazy to stay with one person for the rest of her life. Lilla was barely seventeen, the same as Astoria, why would she be engaged now? The music from the orchestra was drowning out the tension filling the void.Lilla could barely make eye-contact with her friends.The name sounded familiar to Astoria. Antonin Dolohov, where had she heard that name? She looked at the man more directly and noticed his piercing eyes. Then it struck her like lightening. Antonin Dolohov was a Death Eater. A pit formed at the bottom of Astoria's gut and she was frightened for Lilla. She did not want Lilla to marry a man on the high council of the Dark Lord. She wondered if Lilla knew his true beliefs and where is true loyalty lies."Well, I extend my congratulations to the both of you. Mr. Dolohov would you mind if I stole your fiancé for a mere moment?" Astoria inquired."But of course." Dolohov said lowly.Lilla immediately locked arms with Astoria and she guided her upstairs to her bedroom. Lilla looked as if she was going to pass out from either anxiety or not being able to catch her breath. All the color was drained from her face. The two masked girls sat on the edge of the bed and Astoria gripped Lilla's hand."Now tell me what the hell is going on. Fiancé? Lilla! You are merely seventeen. What the devil- ""It is an arranged marriage." Lilla interjected. "My father and Antonin were proposing a deal. My father wants a seat on some council with Antonin, he said he would allow it with one condition. I was the condition, and my father gave me away with not another thought." Lilla's eyes began to pool until she huffed and shot up to find her cigarettes.She offered one to Astoria, but she denied. She did not want to smell like cigarette smoke at the party, but Lilla's nerves were shot. She needed any type of relief."I do not think you should marry that man, he looks like bad news, Lill." Astoria murmured.She knew exactly who Antonin was, but she did not want to come out and tell Lilla the truth. It was not her place."I have no choice, but let's drop it, eh?" Lilla took a puff from her cigarette. "How are you holding up watching pugged face Parkinson dance with Draco?"Astoria did not like calling Pansy names since they were still friends, but currently she did loathe her. She wished Pansy's dress would snap and she would have to leave."Just dandy. I need to drop it Lilla. He is obviously falling for Pansy. Draco and I had a good bond for a while, but it barely ever progressed. He does not see me in a romantic way. Besides, I have bigger plans for my life than just marriage." Astoria said quietly not realizing what she said...Lilla snorted. "Yeah. I did too."Astoria gave her an apologetic look and Lilla winked at her. The girls ascended back down the stairs to see Pansy and Draco dancing the waltz. Lilla gave Astoria a vomit face and told her to look the other way and drink more champagne. Good idea. Astoria noticed Theo was talking with some other guys from the party and Astoria stood with Lilla and Antonin, until a strange figure approached her."Dolohov. Happy to see you again." The strange extended a glance and Dolohov's eyes were bulging from his skull looking at this man.He was dressed as everyone else. Suit and tie, black mask and his hair was nicely combed. Why was Dolohov looking as if he just saw a ghost? Dolohov stayed silent. Then the figure turned his head and peered toward Astoria. His eyes fixed on hers and dangerous eyes they were."I believe we have not met. I am Thomas M. Riddle, pleasure to make your acquaintance Miss. "Riddle said while lowering his head toward her."Greengrass." Astoria murmured while giving him a grin."Astoria Greengrass? I know your father quite well. Would you care for a dance Miss. Greengrass?" Riddle asked while extending his hand.Astoria accepted kindly and she made her way to the dance floor. Something about this man felt different. His tone was cold, his posture stiff, and his manners, impeccable. His eyes never left her, and it sent shivers down Astoria's spine. When they made it to the dance floor, she noticed Draco watching her. She snubbed him and she noticed his upper lip rise. Riddle placed his hand on Astoria's upper back, and she locked her hand in his, and they swayed across the dance floor."Do tell me, Miss. Greengrass have you a beau? A fine lady as yourself should not have been unacquainted this evening." Riddle murmured."I was accompanied by my good friend Theo Nott. Lilla is my best friend, and I was standing by her for support." Astoria replied casually.She felt Riddle's hands crawl up her back and just as he was turning her his hand touched the rune imprint. She jolted instantly."Sorry, that's an erm—a bad scar. I got it when I was younger. Nothing severe."Riddle leaned in and was inches from her face. "All scars have stories, Miss. Greengrass."She felt herself crack and smile, but her head was not in it. She kept finding herself looking at Draco. How Pansy's eyes were looking into his, when she wanted to be the one looking into them. It was not fair.Riddle glanced at the nearby clock when the dance concluded. Then his eyes shot on Astoria's."This is where I leave you. I just know I shall see you in the very near future, Astoria." Riddle pulled her in and kissed her cheek. His lips were iced cold and it felt almost as if he had not kissed her at all. Astoria brushed off the thought and before she knew it Theo had her in his arms and the next dance was to commence."Who was that you were dancing with?" Theo inquired.Astoria got spun around and was back facing him."I dunno, said his name was Riddle."Theo pondered for a mere moment and looked as if he wanted to say something but quickly dismissed it. After another few twists, turns, quick steps and stepping on toes. A lady in front announced, "And now we switch!" Which indicated for people to switch up their dancing partners. Pansy immediately came over."Come on Theo! Let me push you around for a while! I cannot even lead a bit with this one!" Pansy said while nudging Draco, but he showed no form of amusement."Alright, come on then." Theo said while taking Pansy's hand.Then Astoria was left there alone with Draco. The tension was building on thick. His eyes burning through her skin because she would not yet make eye contact with him. Draco lunged forward and extended his hand. Astoria finally met his gray, stormy, beautiful eyes and she slowly took his hand. The feeling of his hand entwined with hers felt like nothing more than sheer bliss. She kept trying to avoid his eyes and looking all around her until she laughed lowly."Amused?" Draco murmured.Draco squeezed her hand and began to run his fingers along her exposed upper back. The hairs on her neck began to stand and her breath began to slow."Not as amused as you are. Having fun with Pansy? She really is a great girl- "Draco held her firmly in his grasp and jilted her head up to meet his eyes. She could smell the peppermint coming off his breath and the scent of his expensive cologne on his suit."Jealous are we, Greengrass?" Draco inquired. "I seem to remember a few weeks ago during a certain turn of events I saw your lingering eyes at the top of the stairs." Draco whispered while looking at her with great intent.Astoria knew what Draco was referring to. She nearly watching Pansy and Draco have sex because she could not tear her eyes away from the scene. She distinctly remembers making eye contact with him while he had Pansy pushed up against a wall. A memory she is not too fond of remembering."I haven't the slightest idea what you are talking about. However, I have seen your lingering eyes on me while I was dancing with that interesting man. I could just feel the tension of your prying eyes." Astoria spat at him lowly while giving him a smirk.She felt his hand lower and begin to graze her lower back sending shivers up her spine. The music of the self-playing orchestra was coming to the end of the song and she did not want to let Draco leave her grasp. The feeling of his warmth. How his fingers felt in hers. He was supposed to be here with her tonight, not Parkinson.Without another thought Pansy came in between the two and took Draco's hand in hers. Causing Astoria to beam a wicked look at Pansy. Pansy was becoming suspicious about the chemistry between Astoria and her date. Theo came up behind Astoria and placed a hand on her arm. As Astoria was about to turn her head, she noticed Pansy smashing her lips on Draco's. Her heart sank into her stomach. Her blood began to boil, she felt the immense dark magic of the rune building up in her bones. She did not mean to do what she did next. It just happened.Astoria sternly muttered under her breath, "Stupefy."Pansy fell to the ground, knocked out cold. Astoria felt better until everyone was crowding around Pansy. Draco's eyes fixed on hers. She started to feel cornered. Theo's eyes on her along with Draco's. She felt her feet carry her away upstairs."Nott tend to this one, will you?" Draco said lowly."Sure, mate." Theo replied.Draco hastened after Astoria. She felt him following her. Where could she go to hide? The lavatory? The library? The Dubois state was enormous and there were so many rooms off the hallways. She finally remembered where Lilla's bedroom was, and she rushed inside.Draco ran through the hallway trying to figure out where she went. Until he noticed a light at the bottom of one of the bedrooms. He turned the knob to find Astoria sitting on the windowsill. She was showing no remorse."You stunned my date, Greengrass. Are you mental?" Draco inquired."Oh, she will be fine. Someone will reinnervate her and she will be good as new. Do me a favor when she is awake again why don't you fuck her brains out and remind her how much you care for her." Astoria spat."Enough of this silly little-girl drama Greengrass."Astoria rose and lunged in front of him, pointing her finger on his chest. She looked into those gray eyes and was no longer holding back."You did this. YOU DID." Astoria spat. "Truie."
  
Draco let out a low laugh and cocked his head. "And how am I a pig?"Astoria forgot that Malfoy spoke French, she never did ask him why he knew the language. Such information was unimportant currently. In this moment she felt a whirlwind of emotions. She could put her hands around his throat and strangle Malfoy until his face turned purple, or she could speak her true feelings. Put all her feelings on the table. Astoria had nothing to lose, she had no lover, no real freedom and she was separated from her family. It did not make things any more stable that everyone around her was disappointing her.She was disappointed in Malfoy for his outrageous behavior because the connection was apparent, but he decided to disregard it. Pansy was no better, but Pansy was oblivious to anything ever happening between Astoria and Draco.Astoria could feel the tears from rage and sadness forming her eyes, it was taking all of her might not to let them flow down her cheeks. She needed to stay strong and show that she was not a blubbering little girl."You have been fucking my best friend! I hope you have a dazzling life with her because I am done with you. I am finished being your friend, your ally or whatever the fuck we were. I am not even sure myself!" Astoria roared while grabbing her mask off the bed and making a dart for the bedroom door."Pansy is always going to be there." Draco admitted lowly.Astoria turning around looking confused. What did he mean? Why was he trying to patch this up and make it seem right?"Elaborate. You are making no sense." Astoria said sounding bored."Merlin, Astoria! In a blink of an eye, you could be gone. Your fucking Master could whisk you away and you will have no choice but to go. Then you leave me behind." Draco untied his mask and threw it against the wall causing Astoria to jump.Malfoy was afraid of being abandoned. It was starting to become clear. His distance, his cautiousness not to kiss or touch her often, and trying to avoid looking her way. Draco was not afraid of committing to her, he was afraid of losing her if she became too important to him. The realization caused something to shift inside Astoria, her heart began to ache."I-I... no that would never happen." Astoria shook her head in disbelief. She never thought about if her Master would force her to leave behind everyone she loved. The realization was coming down on her like a pile of bricks."If I let myself go then I cannot lose you. It will fucking crush me." Draco admitted looking defeated.Astoria felt herself being pulled to him. She felt hot tears rolling down her cheeks. The ache in her heart was starting to take over her body. Her breathing became low and her eyes fixed on Draco's façade. She could not help herself she hurried over to him and embraced him tightly and he put his arms around her. She felt herself crying into his shoulder and started to lightly stroke his hair. His embrace was tight, warm, and wonderful. This was no ordinary hug; it was the hug they both needed from each other for months.During this moment, Astoria felt the pain of him sleeping with Pansy for the last few weeks. She was still angry. She wanted to know why he did and why when he saw her at the top of the stairs, he did not stop his actions.She abruptly broke the hug and put her hands in her hair."No. You cannot be saying those things to me anymore and we should not be doing what we are doing. You are here with Pansy, Draco. Pansy is in love with you, dammit. Remember her? The girl you have been fucking consistently for some time." Astoria spat. She shook her head and finally asked the question she has been wondering all night. "Do you love her?"Draco lowered his head and sighed. "No."Astoria lunged forward and shook her head. "Wrong answer. When you look into her eyes tonight try and look like you are, for her sake." She said lowly.Draco grabbed Astoria by the arm forcing their chests to touch. His breathing fastened and he cupped her face. Their eyes locked on each-others. Astoria should break free, leave, run back to the party. It was no surprise that this man was intoxicating for her. She never wanted to leave his grasp."When I look into her eyes all I am fucking thinking about is how they are not your shit brown eyes not looking back at mine. When I am inside her, it's your face I am imagining beneath me." Draco said lowly.Was this supposed to make her feel better? All it did was make her feel worse."Great. You are thinking about me while you are balls deep in my best friend. Nice chat." Astoria said while breaking the grasp and yet again heading for the door."You are infuriating, Greengrass! You know that right!" Draco said as he almost ran toward her.Before she knew it, her legs were wrapped around his torso and she was pushed up against the door. Her lips smashed on his and her hands gripping his blond hair. She felt his hands start to hitch up behind her dress and grasp her backside. She let out a whimper and she bit his bottom lip causing his grasp to tighten.Draco gripped Astoria's hair by the roots and pulled her head back. He laid kisses and bruises along her neck. The pulsing between her legs was becoming more apparent with every kiss he bestowed."Don't...ahhh..." Astoria said lowly while trying to catch her breath."Tell me to stop." Draco murmured against her jawline. He carefully kissed below her neck, along her jaw and back onto her lips.She gripped his head and planted a passionate kiss upon his lips. She pulled away to meet his eyes."Don't fucking stop." She whispered.Without another second Draco muttered, muffliato to shield the room from listening ears. Astoria felt herself being carried over to Lilla's bed. She felt the softness of the comforter, the firmness of the bed and the warmth of the man before her. Everything was escalating and Astoria was letting it. She felt herself giving into him more and more, with every kiss planted.Draco's hands hitched up her dress to lightly rub the inside of her thigh. The pulse sensation between her legs was turning into a throb with every inch his hand moved. Astoria began to take off his tie slowly, and then began to unbutton his shirt.Astoria stood at the edge of the bed and Draco sat up watching her. She slowly slipped off the straps of her dress and let the gown fall to her feet. She stood before him in a black laced bra and a black laced thong. Draco has seen her in her underwear before when they were in Porthcurno but tonight he was going to see all of her. Exposed. Bare. Hungry for his affections.Draco pulled her back onto the bed and unclasped her bra, causing her to let out a whimper. His face rose and he planted suctioned kisses between her breasts and up her neck."Tell me I can." Draco said while gripping the side of her underwear.Astoria took his face in her hands and nodded lightly while connecting their lips. Without another word he flipped her over on the bed and he was regarding her. He rans his fingers up the sides of her body causing her flinch and wiggle. Draco gripped the side of her thong and ripped it from her body.She let out a soft cry of the instant pain but quickly got over it. He laid on top of her and cupped her breast in his hand. He planted more soft kisses along her shoulders and lips."You told me I was nothing." Astoria murmured.Draco looked at her in the eye and smirked. "You are everything and more, Astoria." He said boldly.She felt herself crack a smile and she placed a kiss upon his lips. She felt his hand hitch up her inner thigh and brush the sides of her entrance. He knew how aroused she was, and she was not trying to hide it.She has only had sex with one other man in her life, Cedric. Cedric was not horrible in the sack, but Astoria never climaxed with him. She felt she was broken for not being able to climax during sex, sometimes felt it was her own fault. She was always too in her mind when a man was between her legs. The insecure thoughts of a teenage girl.Draco went to pull the back of her neck when she felt him grab her rune. Her eyes immediately shot up and she felt a tear leave her eye."I am sorry. I should have put the damn charm on it. I am so stupid- "Without another word Malfoy took out his wand, pointed it at his left forarm and before her eyes his Dark Mark reappeared. He let out a sigh and cupped her cheek."We are both tethered to the same Lord." Draco said lowly.Astoria sighed. "Except he owns me.""He will never truly own all of you." Draco said while smashing his lips on hers.Astoria rolled him over and sat on top of him. She could feel him harden between her legs and that caused her to pulse harder down below. Astoria felt herself unconsciously grinding against him and he let out soft groans with every movement."Fuck me" Astoria whispered in Draco's ear.Astoria was on her back and as she looked at the ceiling. She almost felt this was not at real and she was having another steamy dream. She was going to wake up in her four-poster bed next to Pansy snoring. But this was all very real, almost too real.Astoria felt Draco line himself up with her entrance and without another glance he pushed himself inside. He immediately began to curse under his breath with every pulse. Astoria sat herself forward and gazed into his eyes as he pushed himself inside her deeper with every thrust."Next-ahh-time you're fucking Pansy—ohhh- remember this." Astoria smirked.Draco laughed lowly and began to thrust in her harder after she said that. She left nail marks on his back and that caused him to groan louder. She felt his grasp on her hip begin to tighten."You are intoxicating... hmmm-Greengrass. How could I ever go back once I have had this?" Draco said lowly while squeezing her left breast and thrusting as deep as he could.Draco flipped her onto all fours began to push inside her from the back. She threw her hair back and he grabbed it with a force. After a few rough thrusts a build was stating to happen inside Astoria. Almost like an explosion was going to happen. She felt herself becoming sweaty, warm and her blood beginning to boil. Her legs beginning to push themselves together. What was it she was feeling?"Cum for me, Astoria." Draco spat.Without another word Astoria unraveled while he was inside her. She felt herself release and her face scrunch up from the pain that was pleasure. Everything she was feeling unraveled with every thrust he gave her.Astoria began to moan lowly and without another word she felt Draco unravel inside her. She felt herself warm up from his orgasm and he immediately waved his wand to cast a cleaning charm over them both. She felt her hair go back into place, her makeup reapplied, and her dress was back on.Astoria looked up at Draco and realized she forgotten that she stunned Pansy. Now she was the worlds worst friend. Astoria managed to knock out Pansy, sleep with her "boyfriend" and leave her downstairs alone."Do you think anyone rennervated Pansy?" Astoria inquired while tying her mask back on her face.The masquerade was still happening downstairs and all Astoria wanted to do now was steal Draco and leave. She did not care about anyone else."Dear Merlin, I hope not." Malfoy said with a laugh.Astoria had her hand on the knob, but then she turned around to face the blond behind her."Y'know Pansy was right. You are pretty good in the sack." Astoria said while releasing a loud laugh.Malfoy smirked and pushed her back up against the doorway. His hand finding her backside and he bit her bottom lip."I am the best. Don't you ever forget it, Greengrass." He said with a snark and he gave her a wink.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Dear Daph,Well, if you are still irritated at me for having you sent away you will love this letter. Within the time I last saw you until now I have managed to ruin a friendship, ruin a relationship, and save a life only to condemn it in another manner. For the past two years Draco Malfoy and I have basically been dancing around one another. I found out recently why, it was because he was afraid of eventually losing me. Anyways, I will not be returning home for Christmas this year. I simply cannot face Mother and Father, and I do not think they wish to see me neither. Let them know I think of them often. You are going to be an amazing healer, Daph. Maybe one day I will have the honor of you healing one of my wounds. Happy Christmas.All my love,ToriTo say the tension between Pansy and Astoria was thick would-be understatement. Pansy decided she could not look at Astoria any longer, so she moved herself out of their dorm, and Lilla moved in with Astoria. She did not think that was an all-bad thing. Lilla was her most trusted friend and right now Lilla needed her more than anyone else, since now she was to be married when she turned eighteen. She still had well over a year to get used to the idea, but right now she was starting to isolate herself from the world. Astoria would do all she could to get Lilla out of her shell. She asked her many times to go to London for a weekend, spend a night drinking in the common room and occasionally offer to smoke with her. Lilla stayed locked away in her dorm before and after classes. It was heartbreaking for Astoria to see this strong-willed girl at such a low."Please come outside with me. I will conjure you a self-warming cloak and you will stay nice and toasty in the snow." Astoria stated.Lilla was in her bed reading a book, Little Women, she must have read it at least four times already. It seemed to be her comfort story."No, you go. I am happy here." Lilla said lowly not looking at Astoria.Astoria grabbed her cigarettes and walked out of the room. When she was walking through the dark hallway, she felt someone tug her by the arm and she was pushed up against the wall. Her lips connected with another's; hints of peppermint filled her nostrils. She felt hands hike up her shirt and in her hair. She knew these hands well, all too well."You cannot just push me against any wall and kiss me whenever you feel like it." Astoria said sarcastically while attempting to look at gray stormy eyes."Oh please. I'll push you up against anything whenever I want." Draco murmured against her lips.Draco and Astoria were not officially a pair, and they did not make their affections public. However, after the masquerade it was apparent what was going on when Pansy awoke and realized it was Astoria who stunned her. Pansy put the pieces together quickly."What the bloody hell Astoria! How dare you! Are you mad?" Pansy yelled while flaring her hands around.Draco stood awkwardly next to Astoria trying not to make eye-contact with Pansy in front of him. Astoria felt herself twinge slightly and Pansy's eyes shifted both from her to Draco. Then she let out a large huff."You? And Him!" Pansy said, surprisingly. "You." Pointing her finger at Astoria. "We are no longer friends or roommates. How dare you go behind my back and do THIS." Pansy's eyes shifted towards Draco's. "And you. You are a filthy man-whore- "Draco's eyes began to fill with rage and his upper lip rose."Watch yourself, Parkinson. Do not say anything you will regret." Draco spat.Pansy let out a huff and stormed out of Lilla's parents' estate. The whole parties' eyes were fixed on Draco and Astoria. Astoria felt a knot form in her stomach, and she felt Draco touch her back and guide her out of the room.Draco and Astoria became closer, not just in intimacy but with friendship. With all their secrets revealed to one another there was no more room for putting off the inevitable. The couple shared a bond, a connection inexplainable with words. They would study for potions together in the library and she would find him staring at her when she would be rattling off the ingredient list for Amortentia. She would nudge him to stop looking at her, but he would never."Where you off to?" Draco inquired while leaning next to her fiddling with his rings."I was just going outside for a cigarette. Want to join?"Draco scoffed. "Can't you quit that nasty habit? It is most unattractive.""Hell no. You drive me crazy I need something to calm my nerves." Astoria snarked.Draco and Astoria strolled down to the large oak tree that sat next to the Black Lake. Malfoy waved his wand to conjure a bench, so they did not sit on the snow. Astoria took a few puffs of her cigarette and she noticed Draco was surrounded by his thoughts."You seem distracted. What troubles you?"Draco shook his head and leaned back on the bench putting his leg over his knee."Nothing for you to worry about. I cannot see you tonight, I have other matters that require my attention." Draco admitted looking doubtful.Astoria found herself thinking about what could be more important than her. Usually at night Draco and Astoria would sit in the common room when everyone else was asleep to enjoy one another's company. They often stayed secluded when they wanted to be closer. To avoid questions or prying eyes it was easier to keep their intimacy in the shadows. The only people who knew they had been intimate would-be Lilla, Theo, and Pansy. Blaise was always kept in the dark.Astoria discovered that Draco would also not be returning home for Christmas. She felt her spirits lift when he told her that. It would be the first time she is spending Christmas with him. Usually, the castle is empty during Christmas break so they could be together all they wanted without the worry of prying eyes.Astoria spent her late afternoon reading in the library until she realized she was late for the farewell feast. She packed up her satchell and trotted to the Great Hall. She noticed everyone already sitting in their usual spots, except for Pansy sitting next to Draco. Astoria and Pansy have not exchanged more than a few words to one another since the masquerade party, so to say it was awkward was an understatement.Astoria sat across from Draco and next to Theo at the Slytherin table. The table went silent as she sat down which she found odd. Were they talking about her prior to her arrival? Did she miss something?"Sorry everyone. I was finishing up a book and I lost track of- ""Did not notice." Pansy interjected sharply.Astoria cocked her head and gave a smirk to Pansy. She piled on some grilled chicken onto her plate and she noticed Draco's uncomfortable expression. Something was irking him."So, I hear Parvati has been shagging that one guy from Ravenclaw. They were seen getting hot and steamy in the boat house last night!" Astoria said lowly.Pansy rolled her eyes and huffed. "How intriguing... do go on." Pansy said sarcastically.Astoria knew Pansy was still bitter about the situation with Draco. She expected a few conversational jabs from her every now and again, so she decided to let these slide off her shoulders.The group went on talking about what they were expecting to do during Christmas break. Then Draco mentioned how he would be spending his Christmas at Hogwarts, naturally Astoria chimed in and mentioned that was also her plan for the holiday."Wow... How fucking romantic." Pansy spat.Astoria finally had enough of Pansy's ugliness. She kenw she was bitter, but making jabs at Astoria every chance she got was unnecessary. It was time to settle the girl drama as women."Okay, Pansy what is your issue?" Astoria spat while furrowing her brows.Pansy sat forward, looked at Draco and back at Astoria and scoffed loudly."Issue? What is my issue? I do not think I have an issue. Do I have an issue Theo?" Pansy said while switching her gaze to Theo roughly.Theo looked like a deer in headlight and threw his hands up in surrender. "Hey, do not get me involved. I am just trying to eat my potatoes here."Pansy shot her gaze back at Astoria. "I have no issue. It seems as though you do since you brought it up."Astoria left speechless for a moment until she found the courage to speak up for herself. "I do not have an issue. I am sorry if you are still fucking bitter over what happened on Halloween but- ""Bitter? Why should I be bitter over the fact you whored yourself to my boyfriend." Pansy spat.Now Astoria was set off. Her blood was boiling, he wand was clutched in her hand and was ready to shoot a hex at Pansy that flung her against the wall. Draco's eyes bulged out of his head and his upper lip scowled. He looked as if he was going to say something, but Astoria kicked him under the table to keep him quiet. This was her own battle to win."Oh, so I am the whore? Tell me Pansy. If I am the whore, then who was the one that dry-humped Draco in front of the entire group?" Pansy's mouth almost hit the table and her eyes began to bulge. "Exactly. So, don't even try and call me the whore when we all know you have slept with more guys than I have fingers."Astoria felt her whole body lunged across the table, and her body hitting the wall nearby. Pansy shot a wordless hex at her and she laughed at her pain."PARKINSON!" Draco shouted.Astoria shot up and pointed her wand at Pansy."Stupefy!"Pansy ran out of the way, shooting another hex at Astoria."Immobilize!" Astoria shot at Pansy. She watched as stiff Pansy Parkinson hit the floor and the whole Great Hall began laughing.Then Astoria saw Professor Snape coming her way. She was done for. Hexing another student was forbidden. She might as well start packing her bags and take the train home...Then Astoria realized she no longer lived at home. Professor Snape's home was still her safe house. Where was she going to go if she got expelled?"Greengrass. Let's go." Snape said lowly.Astoria shot Draco a look of reassurance and they walked out of the Great Hall. She felt everyone's eyes on her. She turned around one last time and she noticed Harry walking into the Great Hall as she was exiting. She gave him a low smile and he did nothing but turn away from her. She exhaled greatly but kept on walking with Snape."Care to tell me why you decided to hex Parkinson? For the second time, I hear." Snape said lowly.Astoria rolled her eyes and began rubbing the temples of her head."She called me a whore. What else was I supposed to do?""The rumors are true, are they not? Regarding you and Mr. Malfoy."Astoria bit her bottom lip, lowered her head, and shrugged. She could feel Snape's disappointment. She was not supposed to get involved with anyone, it would only complicate things, but Draco was different. It felt different with him. They understood one another and they could compare scars."Miss. Greengrass, you do realize the predicament you are in? Very soon you are going to be plucked and you will leave everyone behind."Astoria nodded and crossed her arms. "Yes, I know. I do not know what I am doing. Draco and I are drawn to one another, and I know for a fact he will never let me go.""You are going to ruin this boy." Snape stated.Astoria looked around the room and shot up abruptly. She scratched her head and began to look out the window to the Whomping Willow that occupied the grounds. She watched as its branches swayed to the wind, destroying any creature that sat upon it, but it was rooted. It belonged to Hogwarts. Just as she belonged to someone else."No. No I am not. He is strong than you realize. It is not like he is in love with me Professor." Astoria murmured."Believe when I say this, Miss. Greengrass, the Dark Lord will not take kindly to his 'precious one' being shared with another, especially one of his high council.""I will not let it get that far. One day I will leave, and I will not return, I will- "Snape interjected sharpy. "Stupid girl! A storm is going to congregate inside these walls and you, Astoria, are going to be the eye in it."Astoria did not know she was going to be involved with such plans. What kind of storm is Snape talking about? Did this have anything to do with Draco's mystery task?"Tell me what the Dark Lord tasked Malfoy with. I need to know. Perhaps I can do it myself." Astoria suggested lightly."No. He needs to do this to prove his loyalty." Snape said lowly."Tell me what it is!" Astoria spat while smacking her hands upon his desk.Snape seemed even more bored with the conversation. His expression cold, his posture still and his hands clasped."He is tasked with eliminating someone who will be in the Dark Lord's way during the invasion." Snape admitted.Draco was tasked to murder someone, who the hell was it? She could not see Draco getting enough nerve to eliminate someone. Hex them no problem, but to take someone's life, she did not think he had the soul to do so. Astoria knew if it meant saving people, she loved she would eliminate anyone. Then it clicked, an invasion? Invasion with who? When will it be?"When is the invasion?" Astoria asked lowly.Snape shook his head. "I have already discussed too much. You will receive detention for Parkinson, but right now you are dismissed to return to your dormitory. Get out." Snape said while flicking his wand to open his office door.Astoria laid awake with disturbing thoughts not leaving her mind. Astoria did not want to hurt Draco, but she did not want to let him go. She had just found happiness, and now she was being told to end it. Bullshit on that. Astoria decided to push the conversation with Snape to the back of her mind and enjoy the holiday break. Everyone would be out of the Slytherin dorms and she could have a peaceful few week to herself, and occasionally Draco.
  
    Chapter Text
    1996Astoria awoke in her four-poster bed, tightly wrapped in the green silk sheets. She peered out the window to watch the seaweed from the Black Lake sway to the rhythm of the water. She stood on the soles of her feet and wrapped a white and green cardigan around her body. Teeth brushed; hair curled around her face she decided to stroll the hallways of the castle.When she walked out into the Slytherin common room, not a soul was there except for the portraits peering down at her on the wall. She gave them warm greetings and strode out of the dungeons.The silence was impeccable in the castle. Part of her was on edge because of the oddity of the silence but she felt as if she could run down the hallway and not a soul would care.It was a beautiful snow fall outside. The grounds covered in white, and icicles hanging from the edge of the castle. Astoria did not want to waste such a beautiful view, so she decided to walk hastily up the astronomy tower, for a better view. When she reached the top of the steps it was deathly cold, she waved her wand and conjured a self-warming cloak.She stood at the edge of the tower and took a glance over the edge. Fat snowflakes filled the air, and a handful fell onto her eyelashes. She found herself grinning and catching them in her hands. She caught a snowflake that was perfect of size and had sharp cut edges.Astoria waved her wand and conjured an artists' easel, a canvas, and her paint set and brushes She was going to enjoy the view, solitude, and chilly winter air.Astoria allowed her thoughts to run wild with each stroke of the brush. Before she knew it, blue filled her canvas, with hints of white and black. The quietness was becoming too apparent, so Astoria reached into her enchanted bag and pulled out her favorite Fleetwood Mac cassette tape and conjured a tiny stereo. No one would be around to mind if she played the music while she worked. Everyone was spending their vacation with family and she was going to have the best Christmas Eve on her own."You can go your own way..." Astoria quietly sang the song to herself.She began to slowly dance to her own humming and the painting was coming together nicely. She felt herself lighting up on the inside and feeling accomplished, but the painting was missing something. She was not quite sure what it was. She put the paintbrush in her mouth and took a few paces back. She held up her thumb to examine the width of certain aspects until-"Planning on freezing to death?" Draco abruptly said causing Astoria to jump and nearly drop the brush from her mouth."OI! Merlin, Malfoy! You scared the shit out of me!" Astoria said while smacking his arm causing him to playfully cower.He threw his hands up in surrender and she saw him crack a low smile."Sorry. Not really. Are you bloody mental for being up here, in the winter, during a blizzard, on Christmas Eve?"Astoria walked over to him and pointed the wet brush at him causing him to flinch back avoiding paint splatter."I could say the same about you. Why are you up here anyway?"Malfoy shrugged and leaned backward onto the railing. "Maybe I had the same idea. Maybe I wanted to come up here to paint, listen to ghastly music and sing... badly." He said while laughing to himself.Astoria splattered paint on him causing him to jump."Hey! Do not make fun of my singing. I thought I was alone, but I seem to always have some form of shadow trapsing behind me." She said lowly while returning her gaze to her painting.Malfoy stood behind her while also gazing at her painting. The couple stood silent for a minute examining her work."It is missing something. Is it not?" Astoria inquired."Add a hint of purple to this part of it." Draco suggested.Astoria dabbed her brush into purple and added hints of purple into the one part of the landscape. She took a few paces back and was surprised to see how nicely the colors blended."I never knew you had a keen eye for art, Mr. Malfoy.""I am full of surprises." He said lowly, giving her a smirk."Ever created something of your own?" Astoria inquired."When I was young. My father was not open to the idea of his son having a knack for the arts. I gave it up my third year."Astoria was surprised to learn that Draco also had a love for art. She wondered about what he painted. Perhaps he painted when he was feeling happy, sad, loved or hurt. Astoria painted to escape or draw out her own emotions. Her paintings told a story of her own mind."Show me what you got." Astoria flicked her wand and the canvas turned blank and Malfoy's expression went dim, and he began to back away. Astoria held out the brush and paint board at him, but he was reluctant."Absolutely not. Forget it Greengrass." He spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and lowered her hands."Oh, come on. Do not be such a stiff. Like you have anything better to do?" Astoria said while straightening the canvas and raising the easel for his height."As it so happens, I do- ""Just paint something. Stop being a child." Astoria interjected while placing the brush in his hand and nudging him to the easel.Malfoy looked like a child who just got told he must go to kindergarten without his mother. His expression was lot and he looked nervous. Maybe he was worried about his skill? But Astoria wanted him to express himself through the sway of the brush and the possibilities of the blank canvas.Draco held the paint in his hands, dipped it into black, and almost touched the canvas until he shook his head."No, this is ridiculous- "Astoria stood aside of him and grabbed hold of his hand. She gently guided his hand across the canvas and peered at him with a gentle smile. From the corner of her eye, she could see his grin, and his eyes burning through her. She guided his hand to paint the silhouette of an owl."See? Not so difficult." Astoria said lowly."You were guiding my hand the whole time. I never said I was unable to paint. I just did not want to." Draco spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and grabbed the brush out of his hand, flicked her wand and cleared the canvas once more."If you are going to brute then bug off. I am going to enjoy my Christmas Eve in peace." Astoria said while taking her stand in front of her easel.Draco came up behind her and began to run his hand down the front of ear and lightly grasping onto her neck. Astoria felt herself freeze up at his touch and could not find the mobility to move her feet or her hands. She felt the coldness of his rings make the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. It was unnerving how intoxicating this man's touch was to Astoria."You really want me to go?" He said lowly in her ear.Astoria turned around and dropped the paints to the floor. She smashed her lips onto his and wrapped her arms around his neck. She felt his hands tighten around her waist. When Astoria kissed his lips, it felt like skin gliding across silk. Smooth, slippery, and delightful. Draco nipped Astoria's bottom lip causing her to let out a whimper and she grasped the back of his scalp. The soft groans he let out made Astoria fall deeper into the kiss and let herself release.The kiss ended and Astoria looked up at him and bit her bottom lip."You taste like peppermint." She said breathlessly.Draco let out a low laugh and ran his hand through the side of Astoria's hair."You smell like wet paint." He said lowly.Astoria broke out in a grin and then a low laugh."That's odd." She said while rolling her eyes and connecting their lips for a quick kiss."What have you got planned for the rest of your peaceful Christmas Eve?" Draco inquired.Astoria cocked her head and looked up to think playfully."Let's see... polar plunge in the Black Lake, write out a novel explaining my life and then perhaps if I have time... annoy the shit out of you in some way." Astoria said while shrugging.Draco snorted and furrowed down at her. "Well scratch all that except for you annoying the shit out of me. Why don't you meet me in the common room tonight?"Astoria put her hand to her chest in disbelief."You're asking me on a date? I am sorry have I gone mental?""Fine. Then do not come- "Astoria pulled his arm back and put her arms around his neck, while gazing into his eyes."I'd love too. Meet you at 7:00." Astoria said while connecting their lips once more."Dress nicely and bring that cloak." He said before he apparated before her eyes.It was nearly seven and Astoria was finishing up putting on her lipstick. Malfoy told her to dress nice and Astoria did just that. Since it is Christmas Eve was wearing a red sweet-heart neckline dress and some black platform high heels. Astoria blotted her red lips, grabbed her cloak, and made her way to the common room.When she looked down from the top of the steps, she saw Draco sitting on the leather couch with a whiskey in his hand. He was dressed in a black suit, black overcoat and his hair perfectly put together. She found herself getting nervous. Draco and Astoria had never had an official date, they usually found themselves snogging in alcoves away from prying eyes, but tonight was different. There was not another Slytherin student in sight and they were going to take advantage of the rare privacy."Evening." Draco said while standing to greet her.Astoria pushed a piece of hair behind her ear. "Good evening. I see you are already drinking. Pour me one?"Malfoy shook his hand and set the whiskey glass down."Plenty of time to drink where we are going. Come on."Malfoy extended his arm, suggesting that they were going to apparate. Astoria wrapped the cloak around her body and clasped the front."Care to share where we are going?" Astoria inquired hastily before taking his arm."Who knows. Let's find out." Malfoy shrugged and extended his arm once more.Astoria took his arm and with a short crack they arrived outside a dark, dim building with no lights in the windows. Astoria looked around and noticed that the buildings were all dark, and rundown. She had not a clue where Draco took her, she found herself slightly hesitant to peer around the edge of the building."Erm... where are we?" Astoria inquired lowly.Draco walked with her to the front of the building and held the door open for her. He smirked at her and turned his head for her to enter first. Astoria walked into the dim building to find herself at the entrance of a large waiting area of a restaurant. Astoria's mouth almost hit the floor when she looked around. She had been in fancy restaurants before but none that were hidden in the form of abandoned buildings. Magic had its secrets, and this was one of them. Astoria peered up and noticed a largely lit diamond chandelier dangling above her. Astoria was grinning from cheek to cheek and she heard Malfoy laugh lowly to himself."What's so cheeky?" Astoria asked."You are. You look like a kid in a candy store." Draco murmured."I have just never seen something so bizarre but so gorgeous." Astoria replied while spinning to see the moving pictures on the wall.She took note that they were in the town of Ballycastle. Malfoy had apparated them to Ireland. A great deal of strength and magical ability needs to be present to apparate from country to country. She found herself impress with his magical skillset.The couple followed the hostess to the top floor of the building. Candles floated on the ceiling above, and it lightly snowed to the middle of the room. An enormous, decorated Christmas tree sat in the middle of the room and a baby grand piano was playing by itself in the corner of the room."It is so beautiful up here." Astoria said in awe.Draco sat staring at her mesmerizing smile and intoxicating presence. Astoria noticed his stare and gave him a small wink. The couple wrote down their drink and dinner order on an enchanted piece of parchment. It vanished when they were done writing. Astoria ordered a vodka martini, extra dry and Draco ordered an old fashioned. For their dinner they both decided to eat turkey in thought of Christmas Eve. A few moments later the drinks appeared on their table. Astoria was surrounded by magic her entire life, but for some reason tonight she founded herself astounded by every tiny detail."Happy Christmas, Malfoy." Astoria said while raising her glass."Happy Christmas, Greengrass." Draco said lowly.Clink. Clink.Astoria was feeling bold, she felt if there was any good time to have a conversation involving important matters it would be now. She still wanted to know things about Draco.She took a sip of her martini and leaned forward. "May I ask you something?""No, I am not doing the polar plunge." Draco spat while taking a sip of his drink.Astoria rolled her eyes. "You're a comedian. Come on. I want to know things..."Malfoy sat back in his seat and smirked. "You really are a nosey one. Well, alright. What is it you want to know?"Astoria took a deep breath and clasped her hands on the table. "I need you to explain to me what happened with Pansy. The whole situation is unclear.""I do not want to talk about Pansy- ""I need you to tell me the truth. Why did you lead her on for weeks!" Astoria interjected sounding agitated.Draco snorted and bowed his head. "I have told you this once before. I needed someone, but if you want more detail I will oblige. Pansy has been in love with me since we are children. She was always an easy shag. When she kissed me that night, I felt defeated, I needed something to take the edge off, and she was throwing herself at me. I took it." Draco said with a confessional tone.Astoria sat sipping her martini. She wanted more clarification."What edge? That is the part that has me confused. I do not understand, how you can let me kiss you that day and that night you have Pansy Parkinson dry humping you in the common room." She spat. Malfoy rolled his eyes and huffed. "Please, enlighten me." Astoria said."Greengrass, do you realize how much it kills me to see that thing on the back of your neck. How much I want to cut it off, so you do not have the bare looking at it anymore? I thought I could not have you; I was trying to let you go- ""You did not have me then, Draco. I was not sure what we were, and I still do not know- ""I was trying to let you go before I had you." He interjected.Astoria's eyes rose to meet his. "You think you have me now?""Yes. You're mine, Astoria." Draco said lowly.Astoria scoffed and pulled a cigarette from her pocketbook and lit the tip. She noticed Draco's irritated expression when she started smoking, but she did not care. She was her own woman, and she was going to do as she pleased. Right now, yet another man is telling her that she is his. Not uncommon words for her ears to hear."Golly. I have so many masters now it is hard to keep up." Astoria spat while blowing out the cigarette smoke."You have no master. I am going to keep you safe." Draco murmured."Draco. No one can keep me safe. Look at the back of my neck, look at your fucking forearm. Our parents did this to us. We are the product of dishonor in society. There is no keeping me safe." Astoria whispered.Being a member of the Dark Lord's council was not an honorable situation. If people in the restaurant realized who both were, they would be hexed and turned over to the minster of magic. Thankfully, no one knew Draco was officially a Death Eater and very few people knew about Astoria's identity. She hoped that no one would ever have to find out and she could serve her life-sentence in the shadows. "I am never going to be released, Draco. I am his property for life. This rune on the back of my neck says so and it is now written into my DNA." Astoria whispered while taking another large sip of her martini."What if we found a way to reverse the magic in the rune? Perhaps remove it definitely?" Draco inquired.Astoria had never given much thought to the idea of removing her rune. She found many ways to make it invisible with incantation charms, but she never thought it would be possible to remove it. Astoria found herself glimmer with hope but wondered who is smart enough to do such a task."It cannot be done. Any record of a wizard attempting to reverse an engraving spell ended up dead." Astoria confessed.Draco leaned back in his chair and began to swish the ice in his glass. Astoria sipped on her martini, until all that was left was the green olive. She stabbed the olive with the cocktail pick and ate it. She noticed Draco staring around the room and taking deep inhales and exhales. He seemed to be pondering something."I am going to reverse the magic. I will not share what is mine, even with You-Know-Who. It would be easier if the imprint were not on your neck, anywhere else would be more ideal." Draco said.Astoria nodded and let the subject be put to rest. Realistically, she knew that the dark magic within the rune is irreversible and it is nearly impossible to remove. When Astoria was locked up in Spinner's End with Snape the only thing she could do was read or paint. Since it was nearly impossible to conjure some inspiration for painting, she read instead. Astoria researched the magic within the runes. Any record of a wizard attempting to reverse the rune on themselves resulted in death, or severe punishment from their Master. She decided to wait and see whatever research Draco discovered regarding her freedom, and if he devised a viable plan, she would agree."You seem on-edge Miss. Greengrass." Draco said lowly.Without another breath their dinner arrived along side another pair of cocktails. The food smelled divine and Astoria could not clear her mind enough to look comfortable.Astoria shrugged and ate a piece of turkey. She took a sip of her martini and glared at Malfoy."I'm not. I just cannot, for the life of me, get a full read on you. That's all. For example, you tell me you despise me, and here we are. You are telling me I am 'yours.' I deserve some light on the subject." Astoria spat.Draco snorted and glared at her. "All you need know is you are the largest inconvenience in my life-""Well, thank you so very much- "Astoria interjected sharply."Quiet. I was not finished." Draco spat sharply.Astoria closed her mouth immediately and started to listen intently."Last year, I was introduced to the council as a preemptive member. I sat in on the meeting that discussed a woman, she is to be the Dark Lord's source of power and support. The council knew that the woman was going to need protection from people on the outside and the inside. I was tasked with teaching you occlumency so people from the resistance would not be able to penetrate your mind. After the meeting concluded my father pulled me aside and told me to not disappoint him."Astoria swallowed all the information that was being explained to her. She found herself taken aback from learning that Draco knew about her identity before she did."Go on." Astoria murmured."After the lessons concluded and I taught you all that I knew, I reported to You-Know-Who specifically. Before I knew it he was inside my head and watching our encounters. I was instructed to not form an attachment with who was rightfully his."Astoria put her head in her hands and her eyes began to pool. She felt hot tears rolling down her cheeks, Draco offered her the pocket square handkerchief and she accepted it."He knows. He fucking knows. He always knew. We must end this now. I have to leave the school and seclude myself I- "Astoria felt herself going more and more into herself. Her chest began to heave, and her cries began to hiccup. Astoria thought that her affections with Draco were hidden from Voldemort's mind, but she was mistaken. The Dark Lord seems to always be two steps ahead of everyone else."Greengrass, calm yourself." Draco said lowly. "I will sooner die then have you hide yourself away."Astoria smacked her hand on the table. "YOU WILL NOT DIE FOR ME." She roared. "Promise me. Promise me if it comes down to it you will not choose your life for mine.""I will not make that promise." Draco murmured.Astoria launched herself from her seat and ran down the staircase. She ran outside and found herself clutching the brick wall of the building. She let out cries of pain and frustration."This cannot be. This is not right. Just let me die instead of him if it comes to it." Astoria whispered to herself.She felt a warm hand touch her shoulder and she could not bare herself to turn around. The figure behind her hugged her and embraced her tightly."You need to trust me." Draco whispered in her ear."I can only ha-have t-trust in myself. I cannot even trust my parents." She said breathlessly."We did not have a choice in our lives up until now. Trust me when I tell you that we will not be collared forever." Draco whispered in her ear.Astoria turned around and buried her face in his chest. She inhaled the scent of papyrus cologne and felt his hands hold her head. They were two kids being forced into eternal servitude by their parents' decisions. All they had was each other.Draco and Astoria apparated by to the Slytherin common room. The fire was ablaze, and the rooms air was stale. Astoria kicked off her heels and stood in front of the fireplace, contemplating the last few hours."I have made everything difficult for you. Have I not?" Astoria murmured keeping her eyes on the fire."Why would you say such a thing?" Draco spat."Because I forced you to like me! I kissed you, I always hinted at something more when I should have kept my bloody distance. Now look at us, we are in quite a predicament!" Astoria yelled."Have you not realized by now that I am bloody stubborn? You did not force me into anything, Astoria. I chose to fall into this pit, with you!""I just do not see how this will all work. Eventually my Master is going to snatch me away and I will have no choice then you will blame yourself for watching me go. No, I will not have that." Astoria said as she attempted to walk by Draco.Draco grabbed her by the arm and pulled her back. He had his hands cupped in her face and his lips smashed against hers. She melted into his touch and his passionate kiss. Astoria felt a single hot tear run down her cheek and she held onto his hand that gripped around the side of her face.Draco pulled away slightly to look into her eyes. His breathing low and his grip on her face, intense."The only man who will be snatching you away." Draco picked Astoria up and her legs wrapped around his torso. His hands hiked up around her bottom, tensing his grip. "Is me." Draco reconnected their lips, flicked his wand and Astoria opened her eyes to find herself in his dormitory.Draco's dorm consisted of two four-poster beds, a window looking into the Black Lake, and a desk filled with scrolls. Draco's bed had a dark green comforter and black silk sheets. It was perfectly made, and the room was spotless.Astoria released herself from his grasp and pushed him on the edge of the bed. She took a few steps back and began to unzip her dress. His eyes fixed on her movements and her teeth biting her bottom lip."We should not be doing this." She said lowly as her dress hit the floor. She took a few steps backward more. She was wearing black laced underwear and no bra. Draco shot up from the bed and pushed her against the wall. His hand immediately cupping her breast and his mouth smashed against hers."Forbidden fruit tastes sweet." He whispered against her mouth.Astoria wrapped her arms around his neck, and he lifted her back onto the bed. She began to unbutton his shirt and soon after Draco tossed it across the room. Astoria turned him over and took both his wrists and held them against the bed. Her eyes caught the sight of the Dark Mark. The skull wrapped in a lock. She put her hand over it and began to kiss him deeply. His tongue massaging with hers.Draco aggressively turned her over and began to kiss along her jawline. She let out tiny groans as his hand hiked up around her inner thigh. The pulsing sensation was growing more intense with every movement his hand made. Draco must have noticed her attempting to push her thighs together, he began to ascend his head in between her legs.He buried his face in between her thighs and a loud whimper left her lips. Draco cocked his head up and laughed lowly. The sensation was building up in her body, her blood was beginning to boil from arousal, and she began to feel very warm. She put her hand on his head and gripped causing him to apply more pressure."Unravel. Let go." He whispered against her.Astoria cocked her head back and felt her whole-body jolt and tingle. She was on cloud nine and she felt abdomen flex and unflex.She heard the belt unbuckle, and before she knew he was inside her. She needed no time to adjust to him, rather she turned him over. She grinded against him slowly and watched his eyes almost roll back. She took both his hands and pinned them against on the mattress.She enjoyed being in control. She did not have much of it in her life but at this time she had full control over him. She guided his hands around her hips, and up to her chest. She threw her head back and fastened her pace.After a few moments she dropped her head to connect their lips. With every thrust he let out a soft groan in her mouth. It was intoxicating. She disconnected from his mouth and met his eyes."Cum for me." She whispered.She slowed her pace and within seconds she felt him unravel within her. He held onto her and his breathing decreased. She hopped off him, waved her wand and they were instantly clean. She began to re-dress when Draco took her hand."I was just going back to my dorm..." She said lowly."Get the bloody hell in here, Greengrass." He said while pulling her back into the bed.Astoria fell asleep in his arms and his hands stroking her hair. She awoke in the dead of night to find a sleeping Draco. She watched his chest rise and fall. His muscles twitch in his sleep. When she nuzzled into his chest, she felt his arms embrace her tighter.She laid a kiss upon his chest and fell back asleep.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997Weeks had passed since Christmas eve and the air was thick in Slytherin house. It was apparent to the entire house that something was brewing between Astoria and Draco. They would get stared at if they studied in the library together, or if they were seen leaving the grounds in private. It did not bother Astoria that people knew about her and Draco she just did not enjoy being known as the whore who "stole" him away from Pansy Parkinson. There was much more to their story than that but it was not for anyone else's ears but theirs.Astoria found herself hours into research at the library trying to crack the code of the magic behind the rune. She felt herself wanting to throw books at the walls because after hours of reading she felt hopeless."There is nothing in this musty old book!" Astoria slammed it shut and tossed it aside."Stop being pessimistic. There has to be some shred of information in this bloody library." Draco said lowly paging through his own book.Astoria was coming to the realization that if they were going to get anywhere with this plan then they were going to need more depth reading material. She was going to need to poke around the restricted section, but it was not permitted to students without a note from instructors."We need to get into the restricted section. There has to be some sort of dark magic reading material locked in there." Astoria murmured."I have tried picking that lock and charming it open, it does not budge. You will need to get a note from one of these dim-witted professors."Astoria pondered about whom she could ask. She thought of Snape, but it was too risky. If Snape discovered her and Draco were trying to research on how to reverse the magic of her rune, it might get back to her Master. Astoria thought of Professor Trelawney. Astoria enjoyed Divination but Sybill always seemed to keep her distance from Astoria. Astoria now realizes she probably sensed the darkness that lurked around her aura. Then Astoria realized the one professor who favored Slytherin's and was a Slytherin himself..."Slughorn. We can ask Slughorn!" Astoria said proudly."That loony one will sign anything." Draco scoffed.The next day during potions class Astoria stayed after to talk with Professor Slughorn about that day's lesson. She put on her cheeriest smile and laughed at all his jokes, and when he seemed to be happy with the conversation, she would ask for the note."Professor, if I may. I was hoping to read a tad more on the potion concoction of Skele-Gro, but I have searched the entire library selection and I have come up short. Could you perhaps sign this to allow me access to the restricted section?" Astoria asked as politely as she could.Slughorn took the parchment and grabbed his dingy quill."My-my Miss Greengrass I had no idea you held such an interest in potions. Since you are an exceptional student of mine, I would be delighted for you to enhance your knowledge." Slughorn said boldly, signed the parchment and handed it to Astoria.Astoria took the parchment and scurried from the classroom as fast as she could before Slughorn had the chance to ask her anymore questions. She relayed the information to Draco and told him to meet her in the library after the dinner feast.The couple entered the library and handed the parchment to Madam Pince. Pince held the parchment to the light to make sure it was not fake. She handed Astoria the key to the restricted section and her and Draco proceeded inside."Take a look here, there is a section on imprint magic. 'Only the wizard who performed the imprinting spell has the power to reverse the effects, for their blood is bonded with the imprint itself.' Well, that does it. I am done for." Astoria said lowly throwing the book across the room.She put her hand on the table and put her hands into fists. She felt Draco pick her head up and force her to meet his eyes."When muggles see a wall, we see a window. Stop thinking like a muggle. There is always a loophole." Draco murmured.Astoria felt hopeless. It was written in black and white that there was no reversing the magic without Voldemort himself doing it. Astoria knew if anyone attempted to reverse the curse on their own, they would end up dead. She was not going to let Draco or anyone else die for her.Draco was flipping through another text, and Astoria noticed his brows begin to furrow. She tapped his arm and asked him, "What did you find?" but he kept on reading. She asked him again and he hushed her up.Draco raised his head slowly. "I think I may have the loophole."Astoria furrowed her brows and grabbed the book."'Eldritch Magic: Greece 1804' This is the magic that created the rune... 'For the runes that are carved into the slaves' skin, their blood is bonded with the creator. When the runes are carved for a year, the blood magic ritual is complete. For the slave cannot escape, nor will have the desire. For they will be eternally faithful with whom they are bonded with.'" Astoria turned away and began to sob. "Oh my God. This is worse than I had ever feared. My lord a year is merely months away! I will be bonded with the Dark Lord for the rest of my days!" Astoria said as Draco embraced her."I will not let it happen. Give me the book. You did not finish reading." Draco re-opened the book and skipped to the part about reversal magic. 'To break the bond is no mere magic. For you will require two wands instead of one. Blood must be spilt to trade for the cleansing of another. Twist the bones and bend them back to recover what once was.'" Draco closed the book and set it down."It is impossible. It states it clearly this procedure is going to require two wands, blood and someone must fix the bones that are damaged. There is no one smart enough to perform such magic, and there is no one we can trust." Astoria murmured.Astoria thought about all the people she trusted with the information. There was no one in her close-knit friend group that were powerful or skilled enough to perform such magic. She was going to need the smartest person in their year. It almost pained her to say."I have a suggestion. It is mad but, perhaps we could trust her. We can stop whatever is going to happen with her help." Astoria said lowly.Draco cocked his head and scoffed. "And just who did you have in mind? Lilla? That bloody woman can barely transform a feather into a quill." Draco spat.Astoria took a deep breath and braced herself for the ultimate lecture."No, not Lilla. I was thinking that girl Granger. Hermione Granger. I have seen her- ""Absolutely fucking not." Draco interjected.Astoria rolled her eyes. "She is the smartest person in our year. I have seen her wand work and her marks are impeccable. She can do this. We just need to convince her it is for the greater good.""I will not work on something so important with that filthy little mudblood." Draco spat.Astoria felt Hermione was her last chance at freedom. For all they knew Hermione could deny them and it would all be for nothing. Draco needed a second wand for the procedure, and it could not be Lilla or Theo. It needed to be someone with a steady hand and a keen sense for knowledge on the dark magic."This is my life we are discussing Draco. If you cannot see past her blood-status then you might as well kill me yourself, because once the year is up then I will be nothing but committed to the Dark Lord. Help me. Please." Astoria begged.Draco exhaled lowly and threw the book into the bookshelf causing a noise that made Astoria jump. Draco was furious, veins on his forehead were bulging and his hands were fisted tight. He knew there was no other way to save her life.A week later Astoria needed the courage to find Hermione, alone, and talk to her without interruptions. The two girls did not exactly see eye-to-eye, but they were still civil. However, since the fight in the ministry and Astoria's strange disappearance none of the Gryffindors would look her way since then. Astoria tried several times to converse with Harry, but he brushed her off like she was an old rag.During the dinner feast Astoria watched Hermione like a hawk. She needed to get her alone to explain the situation. She was afraid Hermione would ignore her and run from her. Astoria noticed Hermione get up early and exit the Great Hall. Astoria immediately shot up to follow her.She noticed Hermione was heading for the owlery. When she walked through the door the only thing, she saw was all the owls, their droppings and letters waiting to be sent out. She peered out the window until the voice speaking behind startled her."Following me?" Hermione said lowly."No-erm-hi. I was erm-sending out a letter?" Astoria lied, poorly.Hermione nodded and proceeded to walk out."Wait! I erm-need to talk with you." Astoria pleaded."Whatever, it is you have to say I cannot be bothered." Hermione spat.Astoria wanted to know why she was hated by the Gryffindors. In her own eyes, she did nothing wrong to them. She joined Dumbledore's Army and she stood by their side during the battle, until she was whisked away by Lucius Malfoy."Please, I need you to first explain to me why Harry, and all of you loathe me now. I do not understand. That night I- ""You betrayed us, Astoria!" Hermione spat. "You tipped off the Death Eaters that night. You are the reason Sirius Black is dead, he was Harry's godfather!"Astoria felt as if her head was spinning. She had no idea that they thought she was reason for what happened at the ministry. She knew she did not tip anyone off, but she felt Hermione was not going to listen to her."You are one of them! You stay away from me, from Harry, all of us!" Hermione spat."I am not a Death Eater, Granger!" Astoria said as she lunged forward revealing her left forearm. Hermione's eyes bulged in disbelief and she took steps back."Now if you will let me explain. Please." Astoria said lowly.Hermione nodded but kept her distance."I was indeed whisked away that night by Death Eater's. My father is a member of the Dark Lord's council, but that is of no importance. I did not tip of anyone that night, I was there dueling alongside everyone else. At the time, I had no knowledge of my father's beliefs. As you well know, Daphne was also stolen that night and taken into the Dark Lord's custody. He was using her to lure me in. I set Daphne free and my family and I decided it was best to hide her away to study in secret." Astoria said. She was nervous to mention about her runic imprint, but it was the actual reason she needed to talk with Hermione."To put it plainly, I need your help, Hermione." Astoria said lowly.Hermione moved back and began to reach for wand in a defensive stance."Why would you require my help? What do I have that you require?""A hand, a wand and the skill. That night I saved my sister I was tortured by the Dark Lord and I am now cursed with a Eldritch Rune on the back of my neck."Astoria turned around and lifted her hair to expose the 'Inherited Property' runic symbol that is carved onto her neck. Hermione took steps forward and touched it with her finger."Is it... enchanted?" Hermione inquired.Astoria turned around to meet her eyes."Yes. The runic magic is an imprint of the Dark Lord's blood. I have discovered a technique in a way of reversing the damage the dark magic is causing, but it requires two wands to do properly." Astoria murmured."I cannot do this. This goes against everything I believe in. Harry will never forgive me for helping you. Even if you did not have anything to do with that night in the ministry, Harry will never believe otherwise. I cannot- "Hermione began to turn away before Astoria grabbed her forearm."Please, Hermione. The magic is going to be set in place this summer. If I am sent away by the Dark Lord it will ruin Draco, he cannot- "Hermione leaned in looking intrigued."Are you and Draco..erm—together?" She inquired.Astoria thought that was a strange question to ask. But to gain her trust and help she answered her."I would like to say yes, but he is... complicated." Astoria said with a low chuckle."I feel horrible for the way we have treated you since that night. We believed rumors instead of the truth. In the sense of mending the broken, I will help you." Hermione said.Astoria felt relieved. She felt with Hermione by her side then she had a real shot at reversing the magic and keeping her (somewhat) freedom intact. Astoria walked out the owerly feeling on top of the moon. In that short amount of time, she cleared her name with Hermione, secured a second wand for the procedure and was going to reverse the runic magic. The only thing putting a damper on her mood was having to tell Draco. He was not too pleased about having to ask Granger for her help, but at this point Astoria was going to ask anyone with a steady hand. The question "Are you and Draco together?" was hanging over Astoria's mind until she reached the common room. She found it strange that Granger was inquiring about her private life, but she pushed it to the back of her mind and knocked on Draco's door.It swung open and she saw Theo fast asleep and Draco on his head twirling his wand. He gave a small smirk when she entered, and she flopped onto the bed."Evening. Tell me why you are invading my dorm so late at night?" Draco said while stroking parts of Astoria's hair.She smacked his leg lightly causing him to let out a tiny laugh. She rose up and sat on his lap, matching his gaze."Do not be angry with me..." She said lowly turning her head and biting her lip."What have you done this time?" Draco inquired."Let's just say we have a second wand." Astoria murmured.Draco gripped her chin and forced her to meet his eyes. His eyes were gray, stormy and this moment beginning to fill with anger."Do not tell me you- ""She said yes." Astoria interjected."I cannot work with that mudblood. She is impossible and she is way too bossy. I will not heed her commands when your life is at stake." Draco spat lowly."The procedure takes place the next full moon. I need you. Will you be there for me?" Astoria inquired.Draco put his head against her chest and let out a low, drawn exhale in frustration. It was obvious he did not want to work with Hermione, but for the sake of Astoria's freedom he was going to have to play along."If she gives me one command, I am throwing her into the Black Lake with the Giant Squid." Draco murmured still burying his head in her chest.Astoria rolled her eyes and embraced him tightly. She felt the warmth of his skin, the scent of his hair and the cotton of his shirt. Until the next full moon she was going to need to find procedural items and mentally prepare herself. Her life was in the hands of two people who despised one another. What could go wrong?

    1997A couple of days had passed since Astoria last saw Hermione. When Astoria awoke this morning, she found a note slid under her door that told her to meet Hermione in the owlery when she woke up. Astoria quickly tied her hair up and tossed on a Slytherin jumper and hurried to the owlery.As she walked in, she noticed Hermione hidden behind one of the walls and waited for Astoria's arrival. She was curious why Hermione requested to see her."We need to collect the supplies before the next full moon. I have been doing some light reading on the procedure. It requires blood to split to cleanse your own blood. We need to use the blood of a dark creature. I suggest we travel to Romania and scavenge for a vampire. Their blood is darkest of all magical creatures and it will be a fine replacement for the blood you are losing." Hermione said lowly.Astoria kept her arm crossed but nodded to what Hermione was saying. When she mentioned traveling to Romania, she wondered how they were going to find the time to get there. Romania was not exactly close to Britain, so they were going to need to use several portkeys."I do not see how I am going to be able to physically bend the bones to their original state, so I suggest this, after the dark magic is reversed, I dissolve the imprinted bone and re-grow them with SkeleGro. It will be painful, but it is the only plan I have." Hermione stated lowly.Astoria was grateful to all the research Hermione was doing for her. In all honestly, Hermione did not need to do anything for her but perhaps she still felt bad for exiling her since last year. Whatever the reason, Astoria was more than appreciative."I understand. Is there anything more?" Astoria inquired."One more minor detail. Your imprint is tied to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and we all need to protect ourselves. Before the procedure takes place, I am going to change your memories." Hermione murmured.What did she mean change her memories? Astoria was trying to figure out how changing her memories would protect anyone."Erm—care to elaborate on the whole 'changing my memories' bit?"Hermione crossed her arms and exhaled."Astoria, dark wizards who use imprinting curses on their subjects are bound to them. They will know when their mark is being tampered with. I will not put myself, Draco, or anyone else at risk for you. I apologize but you are not that important." Hermione spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and started to become frustrated. Astoria was important, even if it was just to one person, she was still important. She felt insulted for Granger thinking she was easily disposable."Well, thank you for that. You still have not explained how you will be changing my memories." Astoria spat while taking a step forward."Before the procedure starts, I will cast a memorada charm over your mind. These memories will erase all your memory of attempting to remove the runic mark, these conversations, and any thoughts regarding removal. For yours and Draco's protection I will also be placing a false memory to fill the gaps." Hermione said sternly.The air was becoming thicker as Hermione explained her plan. Astoria was nervous about having her mind tampered with, but on one hand she was pleased that Granger was thinking about 'what could be wrong' end of the spectrum. Astoria was only thinking about her freedom afterward, and how much solace she will knowing that the dark magic is no longer polluting her."I agree to all of it. Erm- what will the false memory be, exactly?" Astoria said lowly looking nervous.Hermione shook her. "It is better if you do not know. The memory will be powerful enough to stand in the front of your mind, while all the real memories are hidden. However, they will not be hidden in your mind. Do not ask me where they will be, when the time comes, they will be delivered to you." Hermione said boldly.Now Astoria was more nervous than she was before this conversation. In a matter of minutes, she was facing her mind being tampered with, her bones being dissolved and countless other worries hovering in her mind."When do we leave for Romania?" Astoria inquired."Tomorrow. We will have two days before classes start again on Monday. We will leave tomorrow midday. The portkey will be arranged, meet me at the astronomy tower."Astoria nodded and tightened her ponytail. "Alright, I will tell Draco and we will- ""He is not coming. We are doing this ourselves." Hermione spat.Astoria knew that Draco was not going to be pleased with her roaming around Romania with Granger looking for vampires. Hermione requested she go alone, and she was in no position to argue. Astoria was going to have to break the news calmy and surely, he would see reason..."No fucking way." Draco spat.Astoria put her head down in her hands and scoffed. She knew this conversation was going to be a fight, Draco was as stubborn as a brick wall."Draco, I have no other choice. She wants me to go with her alone." Astoria pleaded.Draco was putting on his black button up for the day and began to pace around his dormitory. Astoria sat on the end of his bed with her feet on his trunk. Since Hermione and Astoria were leaving for Romania the next day there was no wasting time in telling Draco the plan. She just needed to get it over with and take the blow."I am going with you, end of discussion. Do you honestly believe I would let you trapse around Romania with that mudblood alone?" Draco spat.Astoria got up and put her arms around his neck."You need to trust me. I can do this. It will be a quick trip. Vampire, blood, snatch and gone. I promise." Astoria murmured.Draco lunged out of her grasp and paced over to the window. He looked conflicted, but also enraged. Draco Malfoy did not enjoy being out of control especially when it came to Astoria.Draco smacked the wall in front of him and exhaled. Then he went into his top dresser drawer and pulled out his Slytherin robes. He clasped the front and attempted to walk out the door.Astoria grabbed his arm and pulled him over to her. "I need you trust me." Astoria whispered."I trust you. I do not trust her. Do not come back to me with your neck ripped open because a vampire made you his snack, a'ight?" Draco murmured.Astoria nodded and tightly embraced him. She felt his hands in her hair, but she could tell he was still frustrated with the entire plan.Astoria lay awake the entire night thinking about traveling to Romania. She was more nervous than excited, but she had never been to Romania before. Astoria was always fond of adventure, even it was to seek danger.Midday arrived and Astoria needed to make her way up to the Astronomy Tower. She pulled her cloak over her shoulders and outside her door was Malfoy. He was waiting for her."Let's go." He spat.They both walked up to the Astronomy Tower and Astoria saw Hermione waiting for her with the wood carved portkey. A strange specimen for a portkey. Hermione furrowed her brows when she noticed Malfoy."I told you it tis' only to be the both of us." Hermione spat.Draco scoffed and snorted. "Bug off, Granger. I am not going with. If anything happens to her, I leave you responsible. This silly expedition is your idea after all." Draco spat."Well, if you are so clever, do this on your own!" Hermione yelled and as she attempted to exit the scene.Astoria stepped forward and yelled. "Enough! Both of you! You are little children. Draco, goodbye. Hermione, let's get this done." Astoria walked over to the portkey and Hermione followed.She met one last gaze with Draco, and she noticed the regret in his eyes. Almost as if he were willingly watching her leave forever, but she would be back soon. He had nothing to worry about. Hermione was the brightest witch for her age. The girls both gripped the portkey and counted off. Off on three, and they swirled into the air.The girls lightly plummeted in Germany, and then took off again to Romania. They lightly touched the ground in a largely grassed area and Astoria noticed a dark forest in the distance. The air was thick with tension between the girls."We will make it there by sundown." Hermione said as she started to walk in the direction of the forest.Astoria followed while quickly lighting a cigarette. She took a puff and noticed Hermione scoff at her. Astoria furrowed her brows and cocked her head."Problem?" Astoria snapped."Must you do that this very moment? It smells bloody awful." Hermione said lowly while waving the smoke from her nose.Astoria scoffed and flicked the cigarette away from her and threw her arms in the air. A few minutes of silence went by and Astoria was feeling more uncomfortable every moment. She obviously knew Hermione was here out of regret for how everyone treated her the past year, but there seemed to be something more there. She was acting too irritated towards Astoria during this delicate time of attempting to save her life. There was something Astoria was missing."One of us is going to need to slice our hand and draw blood. So, we can lure the vampires over. When the creature is close enough, stun it and we can extract the blood." Hermione noted.Astoria nodded and volunteered to be the one to cut herself. She felt it would be better for her to be the one to bate the creature. Hermione seemed to be calmer in life threatening situations. Astoria was still prone to panic attacks, so she did not want to wig out when time was crucial. Vampire's will drain the blood of any creature in their grasp, especially humans. It would not be wise to lose one's head during a vampire capture.The air was still thick, so Astoria decided to make small conversation. To try and alleviate the tension."So how is Harry these days?" Astoria inquired.Hermione was silent for a few moments."Harry is... is great. Last year was rather difficult for him, but this year seems to be working out better for him. I expect that the rest of the year will have no complications." Hermione said plainly.Astoria nodded and felt genuinely happy that Harry was doing better. After the loss of his godfather, Sirius Black, she expects he went through a rough mourning period. Astoria was happy that he had many friends that cared about him to comfort him during that time. She wished she could have sent him letters and explained how sorry she was, but over the summer she felt it would be inappropriate."I am happy for him. Harry is a great person, and he deserves nothing but happiness." Astoria said proudly. Astoria was feeling bold so she decided that while her and Hermione were on the journey she might as well try and get to know her more."I hear you and Ron Weasley are..." Astoria nudged her and winked. "... you know."Hermione shook her head but then caught her breath. She seemed a bit uncomfortable with the conversation. Astoria felt embarrassed for bringing Ron up."Sorry I did not mean to- ""Forget it." Hermione interjected sharply. "Erm- so. How long have you and Draco been together? You transferred in last year so I would assume not long." Hermione spat.Astoria felt slightly uncomfortable with the tone of Hermione's voice. It was stern but also coated with judgement. Astoria could not understand Hermione's fascination with hers and Draco's possibly relationship. The "title" of what Draco and Astoria was never discussed. Astoria knew her feelings for Draco and he has made it quite clear that he feels that Astoria is his. Astoria brushed off the tone of judgement as that is just Hermione's bossiness and she answered her honestly."It is complicated. We are a complicated pair, let me just say." Astoria scoffed."Was he not with Pansy Parkinson in the Fall?" Hermione inquired sharply with her judgmental tone.Astoria did not answer and hoped she would change the subject."By what I can recall he accompanied her to a masquerade, was it? Then something abruptly changed and before everyone knew it, he was all about you." Hermione said as she stopped and made eye contact with Astoria.Astoria felt her blood begin to boil, the rage fills her eyes, the dark magic enticing her to hex this mudblood into the forest and let her be vampire chow. She suppressed her dark thoughts, took a deep breath, and desperately wanted a cigarette. Anything to not hex this girl into oblivion."Well, Granger, if you would like the details here, they are." Astoria spat while crossing her arms and furrowing her gaze. "The night of the masquerade I took him from Pansy Parkinson and fucked him senseless in my best friends' bed. Any other questions?" Astoria said with a smile on her face.Granger scoffed and broke the gaze. "We're here." Hermione muttered under her breath."Now I will be in that tree waiting for the creature. Just stand here and bleed. Should be easy enough for you to handle." Hermione spat as she handed Astoria the blade.Astoria smirked and slit open her palm with no expression. She has felt worse pain in her life than a measly cut. She has felt the sheer pain of having her bones carved, her blood polluted and her mind twisted. She could handle this with no issue.Hermione scurried off into the tree and Astoria sat in the grass allowing her palm to drip with blood.What seemed like endless hours was only thirty minutes. Astoria sat on the ground scoffing in frustration and she kept glaring at Granger who looked ready for a fight. Astoria was beginning to become restless until she heard something creeping from behind her. She froze instantly and began to breathe harder with every step the creature took. Astoria's body felt glued to the floor until she felt something grab her by the shoulder and yank her to the ground.The vampire was in front of her glaring down at her with red stained fangs, and hungry eyes. Astoria felt in this moment she might die, but she was also waiting for Hermione to strike. A few moments went by and Hermione was not there.The vampire held Astoria's shoulders down and tried numerous times to sink his fangs into her neck. Her legs thrashing, her yells carried up through the trees."HERMIONE!" Astoria cried out.She felt in this moment that Hermione lured her out here to kill her. She was now vampire dinner and it was Granger's fault. She never wanted to help her, she only wanted her to die a painful death. Astoria thrashed her arms harder trying to get the vampire off her tiny body. She punched the vampire in its face, but that only made the creature full of rage. The vampire slapped her across the face and held her arms down. Within moments she felt the vampire's fangs sink into her veins. She felt the pressure of his suction, and her vision became fuzzy. Suddenly, the vampire stopped, and whipped his mouth."You... you taste like death..." Vampire attempted to say.With those few moments Astoria reached for her wand and pointed it at the vampire."STUPEFY!" Astoria yelped and the vampire lay before her knocked out.She immediately rose and held her blood gushing neck. She looked around for Hermione, where was she? Did she leave her to die?"HERMIONE! ANSWER ME!" Astoria yelled out.Astoria trampled around and as she turned her back, she heard someone croak."Ast-Asstoria..."Astoria heard her name trying to be called out. She ran around and looked for the voice it had to be Hermione calling out for her. Astoria trapsed around and looked behind a tall oak tree. That is where she found her. Hermione on the ground with her neck nearly ripped open and her leg scraped. Astoria fell to her side and propped her head up."Hermione tell me what to do. I do not know..." Astoria began to say in a panic. Hermione glanced down to her tiny bag wrapped around her waist. Astoria's hand dove to find anything that would help, she needed the Essence of Dittany to close the wound."Got it!" Astoria yelped out.Just as she was squeezing the dropper on Hermione's wounds, she heard something creeping from behind the tree. Hermione's breathing began to hasten, and she gulped out. "Ru—run. Go—go." Hermione croaked out.Astoria shook her head and continued to squeeze the dropper trying to hurry the pace of the wounds sealing themselves. It felt like it was taking ages watching the skin close and the tendons re-attaching.Astoria heard the creeping get louder with every drop she squeezed. Hermione finally looked up and her eyes bulged."Lethifold!" Hermione cried out.Astoria cocked her head and peered from behind her. It was a large Lethifold creature that attacked Hermione. Lethifold were carnivorous and highly dangerous. They were aggressive and violent by nature in the Wizarding World.Astoria eyes bulged open but then she remembered the lesson on Lethifolds in Defense Against the Dark Arts class. The only known spell to lure them away was a strong patronus charm.Astoria set Hermione's hand on the patch up grass and began to get up slowly. The creature stood thirty feet from her and was one of the most gruesome creature she has ever seen. Astoria slowly reached for her wand and pointed it at the Lethifold."EXPECTO PATRONUM!" Astoria roared. The white glow of the patronus filled the air and sent the creature away. She gripped her hand in the air and kept on her happiest memory. She missed Draco in this moment. She began to fill the blood dripping from her neck more, and she peered down at Hermione who was losing more blood by the second.She lowered her wand and took Hermione's hand."I need to get the blood. I will be right back." Astoria whispered to her.As Astoria was beginning to walk away, she felt Hermione grab her hand once more. Her eyes sad, her face colorless, her neck still soaked in blood, but her voice shaky."I-I am -gg-going to dd-die." Hermione croaked out.Astoria felt her eyes begin to pool, and she felt the tears roll down her cheek. She gripped Hermione's hand tightly."No, no you are not!" She yelped out."I am ss-sorry. I nee-need to ttt-tell you." Hermione said lowly.Astoria furrowed her brows and held her hand. She was not going to let Hermione die here in a forest in Romania."Shhh. Please do not say anything. I just need to get the- ""I—I lo-love him, Astoria." Hermione said breathlessly while the tears rolled down her cheeks.Astoria was confused. She knew she must be talking about Ron. It was apparent those two were snogging all sixth year."You can tell Ron yourself. Now, please Hermione- "Hermione shook her head and grabbed onto Astoria and lunged her down to her."I love him." Hermione said again.Astoria kept looking at her, but Hermione's gaze lowered, and she cried more. Astoria finally understood whom she was talking about. Astoria grabbed the Essence of Dittany and continued to close her wounds as best she could. She squeezed Hermione's hand once more before walking over to the stunned vampire.She took the blade and cut the creature's throat. She held the bottle over the gash and collected as much blood as she needed. She walked back over to Hermione who still looked lifeless, but her chest was rising and falling. Astoria took her arm and apparated her to the nearby large grass area."Tell me where to apparate us. I do not know Romania." Astoria said sharply.Hermione reached into her bag and pulled out a piece of parchment. The parchment had the name of a local inn scribbled upon it. Astoria took Hermione's arm once more and apparated them to the location.In the hours passed Astoria managed to heal her own wound, suction the venom from her veins, and patch up Hermione to the best of her ability. Astoria was sitting in front of the fireplace smoking her, much needed, cigarette when Hermione finally awoke. Hermione's neck was bandaged along with her leg. She was unable to walk. Hermione sat up on the bed and glanced around."How did we get here?" Hermione inquired."I got us here. You will be okay. The wounds should heal by tomorrow. I used enough Dittany on you to patch an army." Astoria murmured while taking a drag."I really thought I was going to die in those woods." Hermione said lowly."For a minute there, me too." Astoria paused. "I thought you left me to die." Astoria croaked out."I am sorry I was not expecting to get attacked by a Lethifold. I have no idea why it was here in Romania! Those things are native to the tropics!" Hermione rambled out.Astoria scoffed but kept taking drags of her cigarette. The air was stale and filled with tension. Astoria finally knew the truth about why Hermione was so intrigued by hers and Draco's relationship. She did not know how to approach this situation and gain more information."Yeah, well, I guess we all were surprised tonight." Astoria said sternly still not making eye contact with Granger."I guess now you know the truth- ""That you're in love with Draco? Yes, now I am all filled in." Astoria interjected as she spun around in the seat snarking at Hermione.Hermione looked uncomfortable but also embarrassed. She obviously did not want Astoria to know the truth, but what else does one share as they are approaching death?"If you are angry I- ""I am not angry. I am confused. Help me to understand!" Astoria interjected as she shot up and tossed her cigarette into the fireplace.Hermione took a deep breath, and her eyes began to pool. Astoria watched tears roll down her pale cheeks and she scraped up fingers wipe them away. She met Astoria's gaze and began to speak lowly."After third year, before fourth Draco and I found ourselves in the right place at the wrong time. I shared things with him I had never even told Harry or Ron. He was the first man to touch me, kiss me and embrace me tightly." Hermione paused to catch her breath and wipe her nose. "We knew when the term started again it would not be wise to be seen with one another. So, we would often meet in the Room of Requirement without the fear of prying eyes. I had never felt so much love for a person, than I do for him. When he looked at me, he was seeing me and nobody else." Hermione paused once more and took a deep breath. "During fourth year I saw less of him as the term progressed. He was keeping his distance from me. I did not understand why. Well, now I do. It is because he met you." Hermione murmured.Astoria felt herself beginning to cry but she did not understand why. She felt as if she singles handedly stole this man from her. She felt this way once before, with her sister, when it was Cedric. Now it was happening all over again but with Draco. Astoria felt her chest becoming heavy and her mind becoming fuzzy. Her eyes were beginning to see black spots because of how anxious she was feeling."But Draco and I barely spoke in fourth year... I..." Astoria breathed out."Draco knew who you were Astoria. Then one day in fifth year I cornered him. Asked him why he was doing this to me. Draco basically told me he did not want to see me again. Then it all made sense when I heard about the masquerade. He left me because he was falling in love with you." Hermione murmured.Draco never expressed that he was in love with Astoria. She was weary about that, she never expressed that to him neither.Astoria shook her head and began to change Hermione's bandages."We will head back to Hogwarts in the morning if you are well-enough to travel. Rest now." Astoria whispered.She sat in front of the fire and felt her eyes slowing closing. She drifted off into a restless night's sleep.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997Astoria jolted herself awake to the sound of Hermione moaning in pain. She shot up from the armchair and examined Hermione's wounds. For some strange reason, the wounds were taking ages to heal even with the magic of Essence of Dittany. Astoria felt conflicted with sending an owl for help or somehow managing to portkey back to Hogwarts and allow Madame Pomfrey to heal her. The problem with the second option is Pomfrey is going to ask where Hermione was to be attacked by a Lethifold. It was too dangerous for the Hogwarts staff to ask questions about the girls' whereabouts, and if the information got back to Snape that Astoria brought Hermione in with suspicious magical creature wounds Astoria would be backed into a corner. Then the procedure of reversing the magic of her imprint would be done for.Astoria began to change the bandages on Hermione's neck when her eyes snapped open. Hermione focused in and then lowered her gaze. Astoria cleansed the wounded areas to the best of her abilities, and she put wrapped her leg in fresh gauze. It seemed Hermione packed for any worst outcome in her tiny bag. Astoria was grateful in this moment that Hermione was prepared."When can we travel home?" Hermione murmured.Astoria pondered for a moment and considered Hermione's ability to travel."If you feel well-enough to Portkey twice then we can leave as soon as you are dressed. We will Portkey back to Germany. The wounds are not healing at the speed they should be, so I am not sure if it is a safe idea in your condition." Astoria concluded while packing up the supplies."I-I feel perfectly well. Once I am back in Hogwarts, I have potions I can take to defend against infection and enhance a faster recovery." Hermione said lowly while trying to get herself out of bed.Astoria attempted to give her a hand with getting up, but Hermione waved her off. Astoria could tell that Hermione was writing off her obvious pain, but she was a big girl who could make her own decisions. If Hermione said she was able, then Astoria was not going to argue. She got what she came to Romania for, vampires' blood, the mission was complete. Although, there was some turbulence the mission was a success.Astoria set up the portkey outside and waited for Hermione to, slowly, walk out to her. Astoria gave her a reassuring nod and Hermione acknowledged by returning one. The girls took each side of the portkey and counted off. They were spinning through the air and Astoria caught a glimpse of the look of terror on Hermione's face. She noticed she was holding her breath and gripping tightly onto the portkey. When it was time for the girls to let go, Hermione let go too early and was dropped to the ground with great force. Astoria walked to the ground and noticed Hermione on the ground, gasping for breath. She rushed to her side."What the devil happened! Why did you let go early! Are you mad?" Astoria said sharply while helping Hermione to stand.Hermione was still gasping for breath due to having the wind knocked out of her. She held onto Astoria's arm tightly and caught her balance."I erm—sorry. I was not focused. My leg felt as if it was tearing in half and I just felt the need to let go. Before I knew it, I was falling straight down." Hermione breathlessly said.Astoria nodded and had her lay back down on the grass patch. She wanted to re-examine her leg wound before they attempted to portkey back to Hogwarts. Astoria noticed that Hermione's leg was splinched and parts of her femur were broken off. Astoria had no idea how this girl was functioning in this moment and not passing out. Astoria realized she may be suffering from nerve damage in her leg, which is why she is not experiencing traumatic pain.Astoria poked Hermione's leg and asked her if she felt anything. Hermione shook her and Astoria took a deep inhale. She needed help."I need to get you back to Hogwarts. How can I do that? You are barely able to walk and you cannot travel like this." Astoria said lowly.She was running out of options at this point."I am going to send for help. Reach into my bag and pull out the piece of glass mirror." Hermione said while tossing Astoria her tiny bag.How was she planning on calling for help with a piece of mirror? Also, who would be coming to help them? It had to be someone they both trusted. Astoria hoped Hermione though this through, and Astoria quickly calmed herself because she knew Granger always triple-checked her plans for weak spots.Astoria pulled out the piece of mirror. It was merely the size of her palm and it looked like a piece to a glass puzzle. She held the mirror up to her face."Say, 'Help us.'" Hermione murmured while laying back on the grass.Astoria held the mirror up to her face again and uttered the words. She figured this was the perfect time for a cigarette.It felt almost like hours went by, but it was only one. Astoria watched the clouds drift across the sky and listening to the wind flow through the trees. She almost forgot she was in Germany. She watched Hermione like a hawk for any sudden movements or weird noises.Hermione seemed strangely calm and she kept glaring at Astoria. Astoria finally decided to break the silence."Can I ask you a personal question?" Astoria asked with a shaky tone.Hermione scoffed and turned her head to the blonde next to her. "Since you saved my life I guess you are entitled to one personal question." Hermione said with a sarcastic tone but with a hint of playfulness.Astoria let out a low laugh and cocked her head to face Hermione."Why do you still love him after what he has done to you?"There was a mere silence for a few minutes. The air was becoming thick and Astoria was becoming anxious. She was worried that her question offended her, but she genuinely was interested. If what Hermione said was true that Draco one day just left her, then why does she still claim to love him?Hermione scoffed and closed her eyes. She took a deep breath and let out a long exhale."I told him I would never give up on him. Draco was awful to me for so long, but I always knew behind all his rage there was someone who was begging to be heard. We are two different people, from different lifestyles, but we need one another." Hermione said lowly not making eye contact with Astoria anymore.Astoria was understanding what Hermione was relaying to her. She understood that Draco was in relationships before her, she just never realized it was with Hermione Granger. In a way, Astoria felt for Hermione, more than she knew."He is not the same man you once knew, Hermione." Astoria said lowly."That is where you are wrong. Draco will always wear the armor of a man who does not feel but you have no idea how much he feels for you when your life is on the line." Hermione spat."Why not just let me die then. Why go through all this trouble to save my life when I am the obstacle that is keeping you from being with the man you love! It does not make sense Hermione!" Astoria yelled while standing to her feet.The story did not make sense. Hermione first claimed that she felt in debt to Astoria to save her life since she exiled her from the Gryffindors. If Hermione was truly in love with Draco, then she would do anything to be with him. Astoria was the only thing standing in the way between them.Hermione sat up, cocked her head, furrowed her brows, and looked Astoria dead in the eyes."Do you not understand?" Hermione spat. "You daft Beauxbaton. Draco will be lost if you die! Every time I see him gazing at you, I feel my heart strings popping, ONE BY ONE." Hermione rubbed her nose and caught her breath. "Real love is when you protect the other person by ANY means necessary. So, I will protect you to protect HIM." Hermione spat.Astoria smacked the ground beneath her in frustration. She was tired of being protected for someone else's sanity. She felt that way with the high council and now she was feeling this way for Draco. Astoria constantly felt like a pawn being moved across the board. Being put in a secure position until the next threat makes their way over to her."Do not save me for his sake. Granger, you have not the idea the predicament Draco and I are in. To put it plainly, if it came down to saving his or my life, I would take mine in a heartbeat." Astoria admitted lowly.Hermione laughed lowly to herself and cocked her head to the side."You clearly do not know him at all. Malfoy will never let you choose his life over yours." Hermione said lowly. "I cannot explain it but he is different with you. He is still a jerk do not get me wrong, but there is fear behind his eyes all the time now." Hermione admitted.Astoria leaned in and met her eyes. "You have not known fear until death is staring you in the face. I have seen it; Draco has seen it and one day you will too. It changes you. I am not changing him, the life that was chosen for him is." Astoria spat.Hermione for the first time ever was speechless. Astoria went back to laying on the ground and glaring at the clouds. She desperately wanted to return home and lay in her four-poster bed and turn over to see Lilla smiling at her.It felt like hours had went by when Astoria heard a sharp crack in the distance. Astoria sat up and peered over her shoulder. Astoria saw him standing there in his black suit. Astoria had never felt happier to see Draco in her life.Draco's eyes met Astoria's and then his gaze lowered to Granger. His eyes bulged and he ran in between the girls."What the bloody hell happened!" Draco spat.Astoria gripped his arm and met his eyes."I will explain it all, but I cannot lift her, and she cannot travel by portkey. We need to get to an inn and let her rest. Her leg is wounded, and it is not healing as fast as it should." Astoria said lowly.Draco scooped up Hermione and Astoria noticed her nuzzle into his chest. For some reason she did not get mad or jealous. She felt at peace with Hermione having this moment being this close to Draco. It may be the last one she ever has with him. As they were walking to the inn Astoria explained what happened in the forest, in detail. But she kept the part about his and Hermione's relationship to herself for the time being."There is an inn just a mile into town. We will walk..." Draco replied.Astoria nodded and kept watching Hermione's grasp around Draco's arm tighten and release. Astoria could not tare her eyes away from Draco carrying Hermione. She had an issue with staring sometimes.The three arrived at a local inn and Astoria charmed the concierge to allow them to always have a room with privacy. Draco set Granger on the bed and poured more Essence of Dittany on her wounds. In a matter of minutes, she was sleeping.Astoria was on the balcony smoking a cigarette when Draco came out to join her. When he sat down, he glared at her, all she wanted to do was to embrace him tightly and for his hands to be wrapped around her. At times she did not know if she were ever going to see him again, and for her to be looking at his gorgeous face she could not be more at ease. Draco demanded she tell him what happened in the forest. She explained every detail leaving out the parts between him and Hermione."I blame myself. I should have been with you. None of this would have happened." Draco spat while rubbing his temple.Astoria scoffed and flicked the edge of her cigarette."Hermione did not want you with us. I was not going to- ""You could have been killed, Greengrass! Vampire bites are lethal. You are lucky Granger has the Dittany on her or else you would have withered away in that forest." Draco interjected sharply.Astoria leaned her head back and closed her eyes in frustration."Yes, well, thank goodness Hermione had that interesting mirror piece which ironically keeps her in close contact with you." Astoria spat.Draco looked away and snorted. He shot up and gripped the ledge of the terrace. His eyes turning conflicted, and his knuckles white from his tight grip."It is nothing you need know. My past is my business." Draco spat.Astoria shot up and pointed her finger at his chest. His top lip quirked, and his breathing became heavier. With every word Draco spoke Astoria became more infuriated. She was tired of the lies, and deceitfulness from Draco."You should have let me wither away when I wanted too. The night of the ball, in London, why could not you let me die! I am nothing to you, but you are everything to HER!" Astoria spat while pointing at Hermione inside.Draco eyes bulged and his facial expression scrunched."You are infuriating." Draco said lowly."Yeah? Well, I should have let the vampire finish me off. Then I would have been free." Astoria spat while her eyes began to pool, her cheeks felt hot and her hands tensed."Granger means nothing to me- ""FUCKING LIAR." Astoria said while slapping the side of Draco's face causing him to slightly faulter.His tongue connected with the inside of his cheek, and he moved the hair out of his face."What are you waiting to hear, Greengrass?" Draco murmured."Just tell me the truth. I am tired of being kept in the dark." Astoria whispered while placing her hands on his chest.Draco took a deep inhale and a long exhale. His took hold of Astoria's chin and forced her to meet his gray eyes."I would have moved heaven and Earth for that girl at one time. I would have whisked her away and lived in solace for the rest of my days- "Draco paused.Astoria felt her eyes pool."Astoria, you are the inconvenience I was not expecting." Draco paused and scoffed. "Granger has my past. Astoria you have my future." He whispered at her.Astoria felt her chest become heavy and her eyes blurred with tears. She knew Draco cared for her, but she never knew that he saw her in his life forever. It was in this moment she knew she was falling in love with Draco Malfoy. Astoria looked into his dark stormy eyes and threw her arms around his neck. She felt his wands wrap around her in a tight embrace and she felt at peace.Draco cupped Astoria's face and smashed his lips against hers. Astoria melted into his touch and slipped her hand into his hair. Draco's hands slid up her shirt to grasp onto her lower back. Astoria arched her body to form around his and she felt him begin to harden beneath her. She slipped her tongue into his mouth and he nipped at the bottom of her lip. Just as Draco began to kiss down her jawline, Astoria glanced over to see Hermione sitting up from her bed watching. Astoria felt bad for half a second and went back to enjoying her moment. She knew that she was going to feel this way for the rest of her days.Astoria felt the guilt of Hermione watching taking over her a few moments later. She ended the kiss and peered into Draco's eyes."To be continued when there is not... prying eyes." Astoria said as she nudged her head to the window.Draco let out a low laugh and he winked at her. Astoria felt slight jitters and then followed him inside. The air went thick with tension and she felt Hermione's eyes burning through her."Anyone for brunch?" Astoria said perkily with a smile.Hours had passed and Hermione rested up a bit. Draco went to set up the portkey outside leaving the girls alone in the room. Astoria was helping Hermione out of bed when she glared at Astoria intently."If anything happens to Draco, I will destroy you myself." Hermione spat."Noted." Astoria murmured.The three traveled back to Hogwarts and they delivered Hermione to Gryffindor tower. Astoria decided to go up to the Astronomy Tower for a cigarette, Draco joined her for some company.The couple sat draping over the railing and the air was beginning to feel warmer. Spring was almost here and that drove a chill down Astoria's spine. If Spring was almost here, then Summer was closer than ever. She had to put her faith into Hermione and Draco that they would reverse the magic of the rune. Astoria took several puffs from her cigarette and she caught Draco in mid-thought."Penny for your thoughts." Astoria said lowly.Draco let out a low laugh and cocked his head."It is nothing. I have to discuss something with you. How do you fancy the opera?" Draco inquired.Astoria had attended many different types of cultured shows in her lifetime. She enjoyed the Russian ballet, the symphony and Italian art shows. But she realized she has never been to an opera."I have never been to the opera, but I have heard it quite an experience." Astoria muttered.Draco pondered with his thoughts for a few moments and turned his gaze over to the blond sitting next to him."Accompany me to the Italian opera in a few weeks. I think it is time you experience some other culture Italian culture, besides paintings." Draco said boldly.Astoria felt her chest rise with excitement and her eyes glisten with joy. She was going to experience something new and different. The best part of it all was it was not life threatening. She would attend the opera with Draco, listen to the beautiful music and enjoy the experience.A few days had passed since Astoria had last seen Draco. She carried on with her classes, did her course work and got snubbed by Pansy. The usual experience from day to day. With everyday coming and going Lilla was not as she once was. Lilla was becoming more introverted than ever. Astoria was frightened for her friend and was hoping with Spring around the corner she will buck up.One day Lilla had not moved from her bed yet and Astoria was fed up. Lilla did not want to take a walk with her, nor accompany her anywhere on the grounds. Lilla strictly went from class and back to bed. Astoria hardly ever saw her eat. She found nutritional potions by her bed stand to keep her from starving to death. Astoria quickly realized her best friend had fallen into depression. She felt ashamed of herself for not noticing sooner, but there was no time better than the present to intervene."You are coming outside with me. Let us go." Astoria snapped while ripping the covers away from Lilla exposing her frightfully skinny façade.Lilla immediately tried to grab hold of the comforter. "NO. I just want to sleep. I am exhausted." She said breathlessly.Astoria was not taking no for an answer. She was determined to get this wonderful girl out of this tomb. She ripped the covers off her once more and flicked her wand. Astoria apparared them to the dock on the Black Lake. Lilla nearly had a panic attack and almost punched Astoria square in the face for making her leave unwillingly."YOU WHORE!" Lilla yelled in her face.Astoria nodded and shook Lilla's shoulders."Call me a whore allll-you wish, Lilla. But I am not letting you sink any further into yourself. Now sit your ass down, have a cigarette and chat with me." Astoria spat while pointing to the edge of the dock.Lilla crossed her arms, rolled her eyes, and plopped a squat on the edge of the dock.Astoria reached into her satchel and pulled out her cigarette carton. Lilla had her hand extended and took the cigarette willingly. Astoria flicked her wand and lit both the buds.Both girls took deep inhales and exhales."Talk to me please." Astoria pleaded while trying to make Lilla's gaze.Lilla tilted her head and pulled her one leg up on the dock. She was silent for a few moments more until she huffed and fixed the hair in her face."I do not know myself anymore, Tori." Lilla said in defeat. She paused slightly. "One day I am Lilla Dubois and the next I am the fiancé of a Death Eater."Lilla's voice was shaking and filled with hints of being heart broken. Astoria was surprised to learn that Lilla finally discovered the identity of her betrothed, Antonin Dolohov. For Dolohov was on the High Council with her Master the Dark Lord.Astoria acted like this was surprising news to her and took her friend's hand. She gave it a light squeeze and finally met her friends blood shot eyes."You will always be Lilla Dubois. The baddest bitch that ever came out of the Beaxubaton Academy of Magic." Astoria said proudly.For the first time in weeks, she saw Lilla crack a grin, followed by a low laugh."I am sure Madame Maxime was happy to see me transfer. 'Miss. Dubois it tis' not lady like to carry a flask in your dress pocket.'" Lilla said while giving her best impression of Madame Maxime.Both the girls laughed, and Astoria wrapped her arm around her best friend. She gave her a tight squeeze and a warm smile. Astoria was happy to see Lilla smiling again. Before the girls knew it, reality set it again, and Lilla's smile faded."Enough of my dramatics. Tell me about what is newest with you. Tell me all about tall, dark, and gloomy. Can't that guy ever crack a smile?" Lilla said while flicking her cigarette into the Black Lake.Astoria took a deep breath and decided it was time to tell her best friend the truth about what was happening between her and Draco. Astoria filled Lilla in on everything she learned on the trip to Romania. Astoria was not ready to tell Lilla the entire truth on why she was traveling with Hermione, so she spared some the details. Astoria is not ready for her closest friend to know who she really is and look at her differently."Draco Malfoy had sex with that girl with the frizzy hair in Gryffindor?" Lilla yelled out.Astoria waived her hands for her to hush down and not be so obvious. Astoria nodded and raised eyebrows."She is also erm—still in love him. That's the cherry on top of the entire story." Astoria said bluntly.Lilla's eyes bulged from her head; her mouth nearly dropped to the floor. Lilla looked more shocked in this moment than Astoria had ever seen her."So, I guess the main question is, does he love her?" Lilla asked lowly.Astoria began to twiddle with her fingers and wanted to avoid the question."If I am being frank, I do not think he is in love with her." She paused. "However, I think it is apparent that he still cares about her."Lilla took Astoria's hand and met her eyes."Do you love him?" Lilla inquired boldly.Astoria looked onto the horizon of the Black Lake. She pondered how she really felt about Draco. When she first met him, he was a bastard of a man, called her names, and was as rude as any person could be to her. But then on the other side of him he made her feel like the most important person on the planet. When she was in his arms nothing else mattered except his protection. If Astoria was honest with herself, she saw Draco in her future, and he told her that she holds his future in her hands. If wanted to be with someone for the rest of their days was that love?Astoria shrugged. "I do not think so..."Lilla wrapped her arm around her best friend and laughed lowly."You are in denial my darling." Lilla said while kissing Astoria on the cheek.The night of the opera was here. Astoria was ready to get gussied up and experience some Italian opera culture. Draco told her to be ready by 6:00PM and he would apparate them to London for the show. Astoria was over the moon with excitement. She wished she could be sharing this moment with Lilla but earlier that day she left a note saying she would be gone for the night and that she will return in the morning. Astoria thought nothing of it and was happy that Lilla was beginning to leave the dormitories more frequently since their conversation at the Black Lake. Astoria glanced at the clock and noticed it was nearly quarter to six. It was time for her to slip into her dress. She was in the bathroom zipping up the side of her dress when she heard a knock at the door. Astoria yelled "Come in!" in thinking it would be Draco at the door. Astoria trapsed out and was surprised to see Pansy Parkinson standing in the middle of her dorm."Pansy? Can I help you?" Astoria said in boredom.Pansy regarded Astoria and looked her up and down. Astoria could see how much pain Pansy was still in, and she wished she could patch up her friendship, but everyday Pansy was snubbing her. Astoria did not know what to do anymore to appeal her, so she gave up on the friendship."I was looking for Lilla. She has my potions book." Pansy spat out.Astoria pointed to Lilla's desk where the Advanced Potions book sat. Astoria gave her one last awkward look and continued to finish dressing herself. Pansy was almost on her way out when she stopped herself."What are you all gussied up for?" Pansy spat while furrowing her brows.Astoria rolled her eyes and met Pansy's gaze. She said with a smile, "Draco and I are going to the Italian opera in London." She said proudly.Pansy shifted in her stance and caught her footing. Astoria noticed her eyes scanning the room and the air was becoming thick with tension."Well... if that is all I am going to- ""He was supposed to be mine y'know? You ruined it for me. Did he ever tell you that our parents were discussing a possible arrangement for the two of us? Bet he did not tell you that huh?" Pansy spat while shifting toward Astoria boldly.Astoria crossed her arms and cocked her head. She shifted toward Pansy more."What can I say Pansy? The man has taste." Astoria spat.Before she knew it Pansy's hand was connected with her cheek and her head was jolted to the side. Astoria fixed her stance and rose her arm to hit Pansy back, except instead of a slap, Astoria punched her in the nose. Pansy hit the ground forcefully. Blood covered Pansy's face, and the rug in the dormitory. Astoria must not had heard the door swing up because when she looked to the side of her, Draco stood in the doorway. His facial expression bored and she noticed him rubbing his temples."DRACO! Did you see that! She HIT me!" Pansy cried out pathetically.Draco scoffed and leaned against the doorway."You hit me first, Parkinson." Astoria spat.Draco laughed lowly and looked down at the bloody Pansy laying on the ground."Well, by the looks of it, it seems Greengrass won this one." Draco admitted lowly.Astoria felt herself smile. Draco handed Astoria a cloak and they strutted out of the dormitory. She was walking as proud as she could and with as much class as possible. Astoria noticed that Pansy's slap hardly left a mark on her face."I cannot believe that your family was considering pairing you with her. Pansy is possibly the whiniest woman to walk this Earth." Astoria murmured.Draco stopped them and looked down at her."Who told you about that?" Draco inquired.Astoria cocked her head and furrowed her brows. Trying to tell him that it was obviously Pansy who told her about the almost arranged marriage. In Slytherin culture it was normal for parents to arrange marriages between other pure-blood Slytherin's. It was the one keyway to keep the blood-line pure and secure.Draco snorted and spun Astoria around making her dress twirl."The only way I would ever agree to an arranged marriage..." He paused while making her meet his eyes. "Is if it was with you..." He whispered.Astoria's eyes bulged and she almost choked on her breath."Are you saying you want to marry me?" Astoria inquired sounding a tad too surprised.Draco smirked and glared at her. "If I was forced to, perhaps. I am sure I could handle you as my wife." He said while connecting their lips.She could not help her cheeks overflowed with a pink hue. Her breathing became quicker and she could not take off the plastered smile on her face. For some reason hearing Draco discuss marriage with her made her heart flutter. At the end of the day, Astoria was a hopeless romantic and anything Draco did that resembled romance, she melted in his fingertips."Let us go. Do not want to be late." Draco said while holding out his arm for Astoria to apparate.Astoria took a breath and took his arm graciously. With a short crack, and a moments long journey she stood in front of a large theatre. Surrounded by beautiful women in formal gowns, men in tuxedos and limousines wrapping around the streets. She gripped onto Draco's forearm and the couple proceeded into the opera house.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997Astoria walked into the opera house and looked up to see a large diamond filled chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The walls were covered with eighteenth century paintings and the music from the orchestra was blaring from all ends. The performance was to begin in approximately thirty minutes, so the couple decided to stroll around the inside of the opera house.Just as Draco and Astoria turned a corner there, she saw them. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were attending the opera as well. Astoria felt her hand clutch Draco's forearm tighter until she heard him in her head."Play it cool. Do not falter." Draco said using legilemns to enter her mind.Astoria raised her head and kept her coolness while prancing over to the Malfoy's. Narcissa was dressed in a black and white laced gown, with her hair up in a bun following curled tendrils rounding her face. Lucius was dressed as Draco was, in a tuxedo with gold-colored cufflinks. With every sharp clatter of Lucius' cane Astoria felt her heart skip a beat. There was something about Lucius that made Astoria add a few layers to her exterior wall."Draco, I am surprised to see you." Lucius said plainly. Then he peered over at Astoria. "I see we brought a guest..erm." Lucius' eyes bulged out and his face turned cold. He was obviously not pleased to see Astoria at the opera with his son."Miss. Greengrass, lovely to see you again. If you ladies will excuse me, I require a few moments with Draco, alone." Lucius spat while turning to his side to guide Draco out of the room.Narcissa's warm smile met Astoria's eyes and she held out her gloved hand. "Walk with me, my dear?"Astoria took her hand and Narcissa linked their arms. She watched Draco walk out of the room with Lucius and a pit began to form in her stomach. Narcissa guided Astoria to their loge viewing area for the opera. Narcissa shooed all prying ears away and sat with Astoria."My dear, you should not be here." Narcissa said shakily while gripping Astoria's hand.Astoria cocked her head and furrowed her brows. Why would she not be allowed to attend an opera performance? Was it the idea that Draco was being seen with a woman?"I do not understand I- ""Draco was told specifically to keep his distance from you." Narcissa interjected sharply.Astoria knew that it was risky for her and Draco to continue seeing one another, but they were drawn like magnets. Wherever she went, Draco followed, wherever Draco went she did. There was no separating them."Mrs. Malfoy please. I-I am sorry. Draco and I we're- ""I know he loves you, Astoria. However, these are delicate times, and we must act smart." Narcissa interjected.Astoria knew that Draco never told her he loved her, but it was apparent to everyone else but her, how he truly felt. Astoria could not put a definition of love or what it felt like to be in love. In some ways she loved Draco but then in other ways she did not. Astoria was still hesitant about what happened between Granger and him. She was not pleased that she still felt that there were pieces from the puzzle missing. Now Astoria also found out that Draco may have been in the midst of an arranged marriage with Pansy. Astoria felt like there was too many thoughts being thrown at her and she was beginning to falter. Draco needed to explain to Astoria more about his past before she could see him in her future."Mrs. Malfoy please he does not love me. For some unknown reason he feels the need to protect me, but that is not love." Astoria said while lowering her head and fidgeting with her rings.Narcissa glared into Astoria's eyes and smiled. "Astoria, that is how my son shows his love. I am not sure if you have, erm—known about his childhood with his fathers—temper, but Draco expresses his love through shielding."Astoria absorbed everything Narcissa was explaining to her. She understood now that was Draco was doing was out of love, but it by no means showed he was in love with Astoria. She still wanted her answers about his past, no exceptions."I understand everything you are saying. Let me assure you, Draco and I are here for a spot of fun." Astoria said boldly and without thinking she let a secret slip from her lips. "Ever since Romania we both needed a night away from- "Astoria stopped herself before she could finish that sentence. She let a few moments pass before she spoke again."Erm- I meant when we were studying vampires that reside in Romania. Disgusting creatures' vampires are. They are so toothy." Astoria quickly rambled hoping Narcissa would change the subject.Narcissa laughed lowly and broke eye contact with her."A word of advice darling, if you are attempting to travel into a dark creature infested forest, travel with a third. Just think if you had not survived the vampire bite. Then the mudblood would have died, and you would have been vampire supper." Narcissa said sharply showing no expression.Astoria felt her hands tense and she cleared her throat. How did Narcissa know about Romania? The whole operation was under strict secrecy."Mrs. Malfoy, my apologies but I have no idea- "Narcissa cut her off and glanced around her shoulders before meeting Astoria's eyes once more. She leaned in and spoke lowly."I know it all. Draco advised me about the plan to erm-reverse it. I am here to tell you I am petrified that Draco is involved in this, but as much as I have tried to talk him out of it, he is determined. I must warn you..." She paused and peered around her once more before resuming. "If this plan were to fail there will be consequences. Not just on you, but anyone involved in taking what belongs to the Dark Lord. I hope you have a safety net plan for the people you are forcing to do this.""I am not forcing anyone- ""Draco is drawn to you, it is force by love, my dear Astoria." Narcissa interjected sharply.Astoria was beginning to have enough of this conversation, but then she soon understood Narcissa's point of view. She was fearful for her son, and the procedure to reverse the magic of Astoria's run was dangerous not only for her, but Hermione and Draco."The witch who is assisting in the procedure is going to erase my memories before we begin. She will conceal them in an object only if something goes wrong. I am supposed to entrust someone with this object until my real memories can be restored." Astoria said lowly."What exactly will be erased and replaced?" Narcissa inquired."The process of the operation, the procedure itself, the memory of the witch helping me, along with Draco's role in the plan. The witch is planning on implanting a false memory in my mind of Draco for him to have complete deniability."Narcissa nodded but her eyes looked sorrowful. She was not happy with the choices his son was making."Who is going to be entrusted with the memories?" Narcissa inquired."I do not know. I have not gotten that far."Narcissa ripped off her glove and pulled off a black diamond ring that rested on her middle finger. She held it out and gave it to Astoria."Place the memories in this ring. Before the procedure starts give it to Draco, he will know with whom it belongs. I will keep the truth safe, please let me do this." Narcissa pleaded.Astoria pondered about the idea of entrusting Narcissa with the truth in her memories if the plan were to fail. She felt it was the best decision for everyone, because Narcissa was Lucius' wife, the Dark Lord's high councilmen, no one was going to suspect Narcissa's foul play.Astoria heard the curtains rustle and she quickly took the ring and placed it into her purse. Narcissa gave her a small nod and both women peered over to the pale men standing in the doorway. Astoria shot up from her seat and took her place next to Draco."Thank you for keeping me company, Mrs. Malfoy." Astoria said proudly while linking her arm with Draco's."My pleasure my dear." Narcissa said while giving her a warm smile."I would advise both of you to make smarter choices. My darling girl, you need to learn to stay on the grounds of Hogwarts. It is not wise for a girl like you to be traipsing around in times like these." Lucius said coldly.Astoria felt her hand grip Draco's arm tighter and her face begin to turn red from rage."My apologies. Next time I will not forget the leash to my collar." Astoria spat and rushed through the curtains of the loge.She was walking fast down the hallway when she felt Draco grab her by the arm and pull her into a hallway."I am sorry about my father. I was never a fan of his, personally. What did you and my mother discuss?" Draco inquired lowly.Astoria felt something come over her. She was not sure if it was the rage of having so many people telling her what she can and cannot do, but she felt out of her own control. She needed to feel some control. Astoria pushed Draco against the wall and smashed her lips onto his.She was not being gentle with her movements. Astoria's hands ran through his hair, grabbing him from the scalp. She heard the soft groans escaping his lips and she nipped his bottom lip. Draco's hands slipped up around her dress and began to feel her chest. The pressure between her legs was building. Astoria peered around her and noticed an empty dressing room.She reached into the leg strap of her dress where she kept her wand and flicked it. The couple ended up in a dim lit dressing room with costumes, makeup and the sound of the opera beginning. Astoria did not care; she wanted this moment. She was going to control this moment in her life.Astoria pushed Draco into an armchair and his eyes looked hungry. She hiked up her dress and laid upon his lap. Thrusting gently against while connecting their lips. She felt his hands hike up around her dress and grabbing her butt. Astoria began to unbutton his shirt and began to kiss around Draco's jawline, followed by his neck. Leaving little bruises, marking her territory.She was on her knees between his legs when she began to unbuckle his trousers. Draco cocked his head and enjoyed every moment."Don't move." Astoria ordered.She ripped off his trousers and began to kiss around his chiseled abdomen, then around his pelvic area. She began to nip at his underwear and started to pull it down gently. Astoria kissed around his pelvis one last time, but she took him in her mouth. His length filled her throat and with every stroke a grunt escaped Draco's mouth. She suctioned are mouth around him and ran her fingers up to his chest. She felt his hand began to guide her to the rhythm he wanted, but she held both hands down. She was going to control this. She looked up and met his eyes."I am tired of people telling me- "She stroked. "-what I can and cannot do."Stroke."You are going to sit there and accept." Astoria spat before she took him in her mouth again.Astoria noticed how the veins in Draco's hands began to bulge when he gripped the arm of the chair."Fuck... Greengrass." He murmured while cocking his head back.Astoria looked up while still holding him in her hands. Her mascara running down her face, her face almost teary, she met his eyes and bit her bottom lip."Cum for me." She whispered while taking him back into her mouth."Erghh-fuck—you whore." Draco spat out."I know." Astoria agreed lowly while letting out a mocking laugh.She began to suck in a quicker manner, and she felt his hands begin to tense around her head. She knew with every stroke she did with her mouth the closer to climax Draco was going to be. She kept up her pace before Draco spoke."Swallow." Draco spat.Draco sat up and pushed Astoria's hand onto him so she would take everything he was going to release. In a few moments, the warm liquid flew to the back of her mouth and she felt it sliding down her throat. She lifted her up, swallowed and licked her lips clean.Draco picked Astoria up and laid her upon his lap, smashing his lips against her and gripping her tightly. Astoria was as much satisfied as Draco was in this moment. In many ways she was a people pleaser and she enjoyed watching someone unravel beneath her fingertips. She deepened the kiss by sliding her tongue into his mouth and fisting his scalp of hair. Soft groans left both of their lips, but Astoria broke the connection."Shall we return to the opera?" She said boldly while placing another kiss upon his lips.Astoria flicked her wand, and casted a cleaning charm over them both. She was in the mirror fixing her lipstick when Draco crept up behind her placing kissing along her shoulders."Or we could stay here and..." Draco murmured while nipping little bruises along her neck.Astoria turned around and connected their lips. She arched herself onto him and felt him harden once more. She grabbed him beneath and smiled."Later." She whispered.Astoria was beginning to walk out the door when Draco spoke bluntly."Astoria tell me the operation is going to work."Astoria was surprised he was asking such a question. Why would he bring up the operation now of all times? Astoria responded but kept her back facing him.She took in a breath and said, "It will. It has too. Granger said as long we she re-carves the scripture in my bones soon enough I will be okay."She heard Draco creep up behind her and spin her around to meet his gray, stormy eyes. His jawline was clenching, and his lip was quirked."I will not lose you." He spat."You will never lose me. Just do not forget who I truly am." She said lowly.Draco furrowed his brows and lowered his expression."You cannot leave me. I will kill everyone in my path to reach you again." He spat."Once the magic is reversed, I will be able to fully make my own decisions and not heed the master's commands." Astoria touched Draco's forearm and began to run her fingers along his Dark Mark."Granger will never understand who we truly are. We are both marked by darkness but bonded by the light inside us." Astoria said as she felt hot tears rolling down her cheeks.Draco cupped her face and made her meet his eyes."You are the only light I have left in me." Draco murmured."After she left." Astoria spat while breaking his grasp.Draco grabbed Astoria's arm and picked her up, shoving her against the wall, smashing their lips together."When will you fucking realize I love you and not her?" Draco said while smashing his lips upon hers."You do not love me; you are obsessed with the idea of saving me." Astoria responded while remaining expressionless.She did not believe him when he said those words to her. In her mind, actions spoke louder than words, and his actions spoke love, but there was also the factor of his past with Granger. There was something missing from the puzzle and she felt it in her gut."What the fuck, Astoria? You are so damn infuriating sometime. I am here trying to explain to you that I love you and here you are spitting in my face." Draco bellowed in her face while throwing his arm in the air.Draco's face was beginning to rage, his fists balled, his jawline clenched, and his breathing became heavier. Astoria could see the battle he was having with himself, but she was not about to swayed by a few measly words."How can you be in love with me when you still care for Granger! You cannot even deny it, she has your mirror, she is the first woman who saw the light in you. She told me if anything happens to you, she will destroy me. She has more love for you than she has for herself." Astoria roared while wiping the tears away.Draco punched the wall next to him, and Astoria watched his knuckles split open. She barely jumped at the noise, as Draco bellowed out in pain."Do not be daft. Granger wants what she cannot have. She knows I love you and she is trying to turn you against me. I guess it is working! Dammit—" Draco croaked out.Astoria gave into herself and kneeled before him. She began to pull fabric off nearby dresses, and she wrapped his hand to stop the bleeding. Astoria realized she could have easily healed him, but he needed to feel this pain. This pain represented what Astoria was feeling inside when he talks about Granger. The skin tearing, heart wrenching truth of Draco and Hermione's past."Tell me why she loves you." Astoria said plainly.Draco cocked his head back in the chair and let out a breath. He cursed under his breath and then sat up to meet Astoria's teared filled eyes.Astoria felt her heart skip a few beats, the knots in her stomach beginning to tighten."In the beginning of fourth year Granger and I were shagging up, but not many people knew. Somehow in Slytherin the word got out I was fucking Gryffindor's princess. I was told I was being a traitor to my beliefs. I was walking down to the Black Lake and I happened to peer inside the boat house when I heard screaming. I poked my head inside to find Crabbe grabbing at Granger and trying to push her to the ground. He was saying things like, 'If Malfoy had you then you must have something special between those legs.' I went crazy, I busted through those doors and before I knew it my hands were covered in blood, and Crabbe's nose was sunken. I held onto Granger as she cried into my chest and I just held onto her and told everything was going to be fine."Astoria walked up and leaned against the wall. The truth was more intense than she was expecting. Hermione did not love Draco for who he was, she loved him for what he did for her. He saved her from being raped by Crabbe. Everything made sense. In Hermione's eyes Draco is the man that keeps saving her. In her eyes, he was her protector."This is why she still has your mirror piece." Astoria said plainly.Draco nodded and put his face in his hands. She could tell he was uncomfortable explaining the past between him and Granger, but it had to be done. Astoria needed to know the reason for the bond between those two.Astoria took both of Draco's hands and kissed them. She gave him a small, warm smile."Thank you for telling me." She said lowly."You did not give me much choice." He spat.Astoria scoffed and smiled. "Life is too short to keep secrets. Especially my life."

    1997The air was warmer than ever. The breeze felt refreshing against Astoria's skin. The procedure was going to commence in a couple of days and Astoria decided to get her ducks in a row. She was not sure if she was going to live through the experience, so she needed for everyone she loved to know she loved them back. Astoria plopped a squat on a sunlit grass patch on the grounds of Hogwarts and began to write to the people who meant most to her.                                 Mother and Father,                             I cannot explain much, but what I can say is I understand now why you chose this life for me. I understand that you could not live in a world where you carried the grief of a stillborn baby. This is me saying thank you for bringing me into this world. I have had experiences only a few can dream of. I have loved and been loved deeply. Please take care of Daphne. I care for her so. I am sorry I failed you in living the life you planned for me. Forgive me.                              AstoriaAstoria sealed the letter with a flick of her wand and placed it carefully into her satchel. She knew she could not explain the reasoning for her death to her parents, but perhaps it would be better for them not knowing. She wanted her parents to know that she forgave them for what they had to do to save her life, but now she was asking for their apology in the reason she could not save her own life. The next letter was going to someone who she loved dearly, and would kill for, her best friend Lilla.                                      Lilla,                          I am sorry I was not honest with you sooner. I did not have the courage to explain who I was, and why this happened to me. If you want the whole story, ask Theo. I am sorry he knew before you did. Forgive me. I hope in some way you find happiness with Antonin. I know it is not ideal, but darling, nothing in our lives is. Live the life you desire. Spend money, drink Italian wine, and become the goddess I always knew you were. Lilla, you were always my most valued friend. Love to you always.                                     ToriAstoria felt the tears pooling her eyes. She slammed her hand onto the book she was writing on and felt frustration. It felt as if she was already dead. She was just waiting in line for the final blow. She lit a cigarette and braced herself for the final letter. A letter to Draco Malfoy. This was by far the most difficult letter she was going to write.                                  Draco,Astoria's quill faltered for she could not find the correct words. How can she write a goodbye letter if she promised too always be there with him? She took puffs of her cigarette and thought hard about what her last written words to him were going to be. Then she peered up and saw Theo walking toward her in the great distance. She wanted to finish this letter now and be done. She wrote the only words that came to mind when her quill hit the parchment.                               To the man I love,                            I am sorry I broke my promise.                                                  AAstoria shoved the letter into her satchel and greeted Theo. They shared a cigarette and discussed potions with Slughorn. After some time, she decided it was time to return to the castle for some much-needed reading time. Astoria was strutting down the hallway when she began to hear something rustling in the walls. When she turned back around it was the Room of Requirement door appearing before her. She thought it was strange it was opening for her, but she went inside and peered around. Astoria walked slowly in and when she got deeper into the room, she noticed a blond figure peering in front of a tall, black, gaudy cabinet. She quickly realized it was Draco and he was muttering charms under his breath and aiming his wand to the cabinet. Astoria hid behind pieces of furniture to watch what he was going to do next. Draco took out a small bird and placed it into the cabinet. Astoria heard him mutter a charm, and when he re-opened the cabinet the tiny bird has vanished. Astoria quickly realized that Draco was tampering with a Vanishing Cabinet, but these cabinets only work if they have a sister. Where was the other cabinet located that he was sending objects to? Astoria peered over when Draco muttered one more charm, and the tiny bird had re-appeared. Draco picked it up, but it was dead. Astoria noticed his expression fall and his eyes become sad. Just as Astoria was going to sneak out of the room, she lost her footing and fell backwards onto a nightstand table. She cursed under her breath and Draco immediately heard her."Who is there! Show yourself!" He demanded.Astoria felt caught and cornered. She fixed her skirt and caught her breath. Astoria strode around the corner and met his gray, stormy eyes. Draco was in a stiff positioning with his wand pointed at her and his face scrunched."What the devil are you doing in here?" He spat while putting his wand back into his robes pocket.Astoria shrugged and walked to break the tension. "I am sorry. The door appeared for me as I was on my way back to the commons. I was curious..."Draco scoffed and smirked. "Nosey brat."Astoria nodded and then looked at the large gaudy cabinet that stood behind the blond."Care to explain why you are fiddling with this ugly cabinet?" Astoria inquired lowly as she ran her fingers along the design of the black cabinet."I am repairing it. That is all you need know." He spat while grasping her elbow and escorting her out of the Room of Requirement.Astoria broke free of his grasp and met his eyes. Draco's eyes always looked as glassy, but today they seemed exhausted. Like a person who had a weight bearing on them for extensive periods of time. Something was bothering him, and it was obvious through his face. After knowing Malfoy for a few years, she knew who the person he was behind the mask. Astoria saw him when he was the bully, the hero, the lover, and the man who was behind groomed in his father's image."Do not brush me off like I am a silly little girl with no capability in handling the truth. Is this the task I have heard so little about? I implore you to be honest with me. What does this vanishing cabinet have to do with- "?"I was chosen." Draco interjected sternly.Astoria furrowed her brows and leaned back against a nearby bookshelf."Chosen? Chosen for what exactly?" She inquired.Draco began to pace, and fiddle with his rings. Astoria could tell this conversation was making him anxious, but perhaps this is what he needed. To discuss what has been weighing on his mind for all these months."I cannot-no-do not get involved in this, Greengrass." Draco said breathlessly still pacing.Astoria strode forward and took his forearm. She gave him a tight squeeze and attempted to kiss him, but he brushed her off."Tell me." She demanded becoming increasingly annoyed."No-No-I- ""TELL ME" She roared at him."I HAVE TO KILL HIM." He replied. Draco's chest began to heave, and his face became disgruntled.Astoria did not understand who he was referring to, but why would he be instructed to kill a man. She did not think Draco had it in his heart to take another person's life for no reason."Who?" She inquired lowly."Dumbledore." He whispered not meeting her eyes.Astoria felt her stomach knot and her hands begin to tighten. Dumbledore was the headmaster, and he was the one who helped her discover her identity. Dumbledore was a threat to the Dark Lord and knew eventually he would try to eliminate Albus from the equation. It never became apparent to Astoria that it would be someone she knew that was tasked with removing Dumbledore. Astoria stood silent for a few moments before attempting to reach for the blond again. She was finally able to touch him and she wrapped her arms around his neck."Hold me." She whispered in his ear. Moments later she felt the firm grip of his hands around her waist. She listened to his hard breaths against her ears, and the inhaled the scent of his cologne.She held onto him for what felt like a long while, but it was not long before he left her grasp.The couple was walking out of the Room of Requirement when a strange looking mirror caught Astoria's eye. She immediately walked over to it and stood before it. Astoria read the inscription on the mirror and was mesmerized by its beauty."Mirror of Erised." She said lowly.She saw in the mirror that Draco was creeping up behind her, but he was smiling."Hey, out of my view." She said playfully."I am standing over here..." Draco said as he stood next to the mirror folding his arms.Astoria's eyes shot back to the mirror and she still saw Draco there standing behind her. But this time Astoria looked different. She had long brown hair, and was wearing a white dress, but was covered in paint splatter. In the mirror, Draco stood next to her and held onto her hand. The woman in the mirror turned around to expose her neck. Astoria noticed there was no rune imprint, the skin where it laid was bare. The woman turned back around and smiled as she linked her arm with Draco. The couple looked happy, almost in an alternative world.Astoria broke her gaze from the mirror and met Draco's eyes once more. His arms folded and his stance leaning against nearby furniture."Are you finished admiring yourself? Can we leave now?" Draco spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and pulled him forward to the mirror."Just stand there and look. Do you see it?" Astoria asked."I see us. Like a normal mirror." He sarcastically.Astoria scoffed and rolled her eyes once more. She stepped out of the frame and examined his face hoping he would see what she saw. Suddenly Draco's eyes shifted as if something was happening."You see it do you not?" Astoria asked.Draco's eyes faltered but then he scoffed and left the frame."I see nothing. This is useless junk in here. Come on." Draco said as he reached for her hand and guided her out of the room.Astoria decided she needed to do something. The procedure was going to commence very soon, and she would never forgive herself if she did not talk to Granger first about an important detail. She knew Granger basically lived in the library, so she made trip there. Astoria walked up and down the aisles, until she caught site of the frizzed haired Gryffindor sitting at a table by a window, alone.Astoria pulled out a chair and plopped a seat. Hermione's head jolted up and had an irritated look on her face, as usual. Astoria noticed she was reading Advanced Bone Healing book for what she assumed in preparation for her procedure."What could it possibly be now, Astoria?" Granger said while continuing to research in her book."Listen this is important. I will never forgive myself if I did not have this conversation with you." Astoria said lowly.Hermione's eyes met hers and she furrowed her brows."Alright. You have my attention." Hermione said placing her elbows on the table.Astoria took a deep breath and leaned in."It is not secret that there is a possibly this removal ends up killing me. If that happens, I need you to give these out." Astoria reached in her satchel and pulled out the letters she wrote to the people she cared most for.Hermione held them in her hand, examined them, and placed them into her bag. She nodded slowly and tried to return reading."There is one other matter." Astoria whispered.Hermione met her gaze and waiting patiently to listen."If something happens to me, take care of him. Please. Something is coming Hermione, and I am not sure what it is yet, it might be war. Get Draco out. Love him the way I could not and allow him to discover the light that is buried beneath." Astoria pleaded.Hermione's eyes bulged from her head and then she reached for Astoria's hand, causing her to jolt. Astoria was surprised that Hermione was showing her condolence. In her mind, she thought she would be jumping for joy, and have a large grin splattered across her face. But Hermione looked sad and conflicted."It will not come to that. I am certain of this- ""Hermione, please. Your word." Astoria implored as she felt the tears build up in her eyes. It was almost making her sick having to say these words to another woman who loved Draco."If You-Know-Who starts a war I will demand The Order puts full protection over Draco. I cannot lose him it will break me, but Astoria, if something happens to you it will break him." Hermione reminded her.Astoria broke her glance and peered out the window. She watched the trees on the grounds sway silently, and the birds chirping on the pillars."Help him. Show him there is more to his life than me. Please, tell him I loved him so. I only wanted to have the freedom of being my own person." Astoria said.Hermione took her hand once more and nodded lightly. Astoria nodded along too and sniffled. She chalked her tears back and shifted in her seat."Have you found someone to keep hold of the object that will obtain your memories if you are captured?" Hermione asked.Astoria had not thought much about what would happen if she were captured during the procedure. She only saw herself dying from the Dark Magic fighting back against the light. Astoria explained who would be holding the memories and it will be secure. After some time, Hermione felt it was best that Narcissa keep the object close and secure. Astoria was still intrigued by the mere fact that there was a possibly of her memories being altered and changed. What would the new memories have her think? Will she still feel the same way she does now, or will the new memories turn her into a different person? Astoria wanted to ask desperately about the altered memories, but she knew Hermione would explain to her, again, that she cannot know the nature of the false memories, it may alter how she feels about them, resulting in her mind locking completely. Astoria felt it was better for Hermione to take control and heed her warnings."We meet in the Shrieking Shack. Have Draco apparate you two to Hogsmeade and I will be there waiting. Everything will be in place, and there will not be another soul for miles. We will have privacy, and if needed, enough time to escape." Hermione said lowly. "Full moon is in two days. I will harness some of the lunar magic and transfigure it into light magic, which will give Draco and I a boost in fighting against the dark magic entwined in the rune." Hermione paused, peered around her and leaned in. "This will not be an easy process for you. Might be the most pain you shall ever feel. I suggest bringing a mild sleeping draught. You need to remain somewhat awake, but at least you will be somewhat incoherent."Astoria obtained all the information Granger was relaying to her and nodded. She felt nervous all of this was happening in two days, but she was ready. If the operation successful she will not be engorged in dark magic when summer arrives, and she will have free will once more. There were more possibilities of it failing then working but Astoria tried to keep herself in high spirits.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997Astoria found herself awake in the early morning to the sound of Lilla's heavy breathing in her sleep. She rolled over onto her side and watched as her friend in a careless slumber. The clock on the wall said it was three in the morning and Astoria did not want to be alone tonight. She carefully slipped out of her covers and slipped out of her dorm.She carefully walked down the Slytherin dorms until she made it to Draco's dormitory. Astoria effortlessly charmed the locked door and peered inside. Theo was snoring loudly and Zabini was doing the same. Astoria saw Draco looking beautiful as he slept. She wondered if she wanted to disturb him, but she figured right now was as good a time as any to do something bold.Astoria crept over to his bed and slide under his covers. Draco jolted awake and cursed under his breath lowly."Shh it's just me. Couldn't sleep." Astoria whispered peering into his exhausted looking eyes.Draco positioned himself so he could meet her eyes more properly. He lifted his hand and cupped her face."Are you nervous?" Draco inquired in a whisper.Astoria was pathetically nervous for what was going to happen to her at sundown. She was nervous that she was going to lose her memories, lose the people she loved or end up being killed for double-crossing the Dark Lord's wishes. Memories of living in France, being oblivious to what her future entailed, flooded her mind constantly. Astoria desired to study and create art in Italy, she wanted nothing more than to express her life through the strokes of a brush. The feeling of never being able to experience what she desired most out of life left Astoria feeling empty."Cool as a cucumber." She lied.She buried her face in his chest and he continued to stroke her hair. If only she could freeze time and live in this moment for the rest of her days."Promise me, you will never leave." Draco whispered into her ear.Astoria felt her heart skip a beat and she exhaled."Promise." She said plainly.Draco continued to stroke Astoria's hair gently as she felt herself fading. She started to feel his strokes becoming faint, and his chest beginning to rise higher from deep breathing. Astoria felt Draco fall asleep beneath her and felt every twitch his body made. She tilted her head up to capture what he looked like in this moment. His eyes closed, his mouth slightly open and his hair perfectly askew. She placed her hand around his torso and began to lightly trace with her fingernails."I love you." She whispered to herself.Astoria knew Draco was asleep in this moment, and she wanted to say it aloud so she could admit it to herself. She was falling into a rabbit hole with the man that slept beneath her. Astoria did not know when the falling would end, or if it ever would. All she knew was she would put Draco before herself. She chalked up everything she felt for Draco and poured it into the realization that she was in love with him.Astoria woke up later that morning to an empty bed. Everyone in the dorm was gone and she peered at the clock, it was almost eight in the morning. She had Divination in ten minutes and felt angry that Draco had woken her up. She quickly slipped into Slytherin robes and basically ran, to Divination. When she made it up the many stairs to the Divination room, she was almost late, and when she arrived inside, she saw Draco sitting with Pansy Parkinson.Astoria's blood instantly boiled and she sat with the first person that caught her eye. Hermione Granger. She knew Granger sat with the rest of the golden trio, but in this moment she did not care. Astoria felt like throwing one of the crystal balls right through Pansy's thick skull. But she knew to let it roll off her shoulders."Erm—Harry is not going to like this." Granger said plainly while flipping through her textbook.Astoria scoffed and began to unpack her belongings. Moments later Ron Weasley and Harry arrived. When Harry made eye contact with Astoria his eyes bulged from his head, and he faltered into Ron."Oh, come now. I won't bite." Astoria said playfully while clearing a space for the boys to sit.Astoria looked up and felt Draco's burning gaze, his lip quirked, and his brows furrowed. She snubbed him and she felt him get angrier.She listened to Trelawney's lecture about the importance of defining exactly what the students see in the crystal ball. She mentioned it is quite common to differentiate a wrongful message. The students were instructed to mutter a charm and look deeply into the crystal."This is bloody dumb. I see nothing." Ron muttered while leaning back into the pillows."Here, Astoria. Have erm- a look." Harry muttered while slightly pushing the crystal closer to her.Harry had not spoken to Astoria since the beginning of term when he snubbed her the first time, he saw her in the Great Hall. After the rumors were put to rest about her being deliberately kidnapped from the ministry (parts of it were true, but she would never reveal it) Harry seemed to peer her way again.Astoria investigated the crystal, and the clouds became gray. Then as she muttered the charm again, she looked deeply into the ball. She saw a tiny face forming inside of it and could barely make out what it was saying, "The inferno starts with you..." Astoria immediately ended the charm and pushed the ball back. She looked to her sides to see if anyone heard what the face was saying, but they looked bewildered by Astoria's scared facial expression.She kept repeating what the face said in her mind, "The inferno starts with you." She had no idea what it meant but the rest of the time in Divination it weighed upon her mind.Classes were over for the day and Astoria decided she would take a walk down to her oak tree next to the Black Lake. She wanted to be alone with her thoughts and enjoy a cigarette in peace.She plopped down at the tree and kept watching the ripples of the water. She even noticed the Giant Squid popping up every so often to stretch its arms. She took long inhales of her drag and just waited for the sun to lower in the sky.Astoria flicked the cigarette into the ground, and she heard footsteps creeping up behind her. She turned her shoulder to find the pale, blond walking toward her. She rolled her eyes and scoffed."Are you done with Parkinson already? I figured she would keep you busy for awhile longer." Astoria spat.Draco scoffed and peered down at her. Astoria refused to meet his eyes."Quit the petty shit, Greengrass. She sat next to me today, and I was not sure if you were going to make it- ""Oh-yes by the way, thanks a bunch for waking me up." Astoria interjected and then gave him a middle finger.Draco laughed lowly and sat next to her."I figured I would let you get rest before tonight." Draco admitted.Astoria was not actually mad about Pansy sitting next to him in class it was just something for her to take her built up anger out on. Astoria felt her head lean against Draco's shoulder and his hand grasp her knee.After a few minutes of silence and enjoying his company. She noticed the sun getting lower in the sky. At any moment it would be time to meet Granger in the Shrieking Shack and get this procedure done. Astoria felt it was as good a time as any to be bold and explain her feelings."I have to tell you." Astoria said lowly.Draco hummed and began fiddling with the rings on his hand.Astoria took a deep breath and flipped her hair."I am falling in love with you." Astoria admitted.Draco was silent for a few moments and he exhaled."I know." He paused. "I heard you last night. I was not asleep." Draco said while squeezing her knee.She felt her heart skip several beats and her skin beginning to sweat. In this moment she felt more vulnerable than she ever had in her life. She was never in love with Cedric, and she never imagined she would be sitting at an oak tree with Draco Malfoy confessing her love for him."Do you love me?" She inquired while meeting his gray eyes.Draco, still expressionless, furrowed his brows and bowed his head. "You know I do." Draco's hand was placed on Astoria's cheek. His thumb massaging her jawline and cheekbone. A smile began to form across Astoria's face."Tell me you'll love me forever." Astoria murmured.Draco leaned in and kissed her lips passionately. His lips tasted like mint and his cologne filled her nostrils."Astoria Greengrass, I love you immensely. You are everything to me. You are mine." Draco never left her eyes."And you are mine, Draco Malfoy." Astoria wrapped her arms sound his neck and pulled him in for a long kiss and a tight embrace.She could feel his hands on her waist, pulling her in. Desiring her. Loving her."Always." Astoria said softly between his kisses.Draco peered into her eyes and exhaled. "Always. Astoria." Draco replied while deepening the kiss.Astoria broke the kiss and sat straddled on his lap. She gripped her necklace and wanted to remember this moment forever. She took her necklace off and levitated it in the air. Astoria flicked her wand and muttered the spell, memorada to conserve the memory within her emerald snake necklace. If she ever wanted to play back this moment, all she had to do was hold the necklace close and mutter the spell.Draco looked across the bay and noticed the sun was setting. He put his head into Astoria's chest and exhaled."It is time. Come on." He muttered.Draco got up and held out his arm for them to apparate to Hogsmeade. Astoria faltered for a moment. If she did not go with him then her chances of living were definite, but her life would be serving the Dark Lord. If she followed him to the shack, then she had a fifty-fifty chance of surviving or dying."The inferno starts with you." She repeated in her head.She looked at Draco's face. He was ready and so was she. This all needed to end. She took his arm and with a short crack they arrived at the walkway of the Shrieking Shack.Astoria reached into her pocket and made sure the black diamond ring Narcissa gave her was still tucked away. When she would see Hermione inside, she would then give her the ring to safely place her memories inside. Draco was unsure about the girls' plan to conceal and change Astoria's memories in the chances she gets captured. Astoria hoped it did not come to that, so she never bothered to explain that aspect of the plan.The Shrieking Shack was said to be one of the most haunted places in Britain. The structure was small and was slightly tilted. Astoria felt herself falter before entering inside."I just need a moment."Draco nodded and pulled her in for a tight embrace. In this moment she felt as if she could either cry or just let herself go numb. She gripped onto the man she loved and listened to his heartbeat for a few moments. Draco went inside without her so Astoria could gather some last thoughts.She inhaled slowly and wanted a chance to sort through her memories. She filed the memories she shared with Draco to the front and the ones involving her doubts towards the back. When she re-opened her eyes, she felt uneasy. She furrowed her brows and investigated the distance, Astoria thought she saw something, but quickly brushed it off as her minds playing tricks.Astoria ascended the stairs slowly and as she was beginning to peer through the doorway, she took note of Draco and Hermione sitting next to each other. The room had windows that had no glass, furniture that was rotted and the shack creaked with every breeze that hit it."Sit." Hermione ordered as she pulled out a nearby chair. "Keep your head up and face me. Do you have the erm—object?" Hermione inquired.Astoria nodded and reached into her pocket. She pulled out the black diamond ring and Draco's eyes bulged from his skull. He attempted to grab the ring from Granger's fingers, but she was too fast."What the fuck? That is my mother's ring. How on Earth did you get it?" Draco spat while peering down at Astoria.Astoria shrugged and desperately did not want to explain. "It is a long story. Go on Hermione."Hermione stood in front of Astoria placed the tip of her wand at the peak of her head."What're you doing?" Draco inquired looking dumbfounded."It's our safety net." Hermione spat. "Take the partial sleeping draught. The spell will activate if I do not put the counter curse on it within the hour."Astoria downed the partial sleeping draught and Hermione took several deep breaths. Astoria glared into Draco's eyes once more, and his stance appeared rigid, his face looking petrified. She shot him a heartfelt smile and closed her eyes."Memorada Exforum. Memorada Exforum." Hermione muttered and the purple charm casted through her wand and into Astoria's mind.Hermione held out the ring and muttered the Memorada charm once more to conceal the memories from Astoria's mind. Hermione handed the ring to Draco and he tucked it away."Make sure you give this to your mother. She can be the one to give you details." Hermione spat."Place her down onto the bed, and free her neck. We need room to work." Hermione murmured.Draco picked up Astoria and laid her flat onto the nearby bed. Astoria was partially awake, and could hear all of what was going on, but she could not feel or move. She was motionless and felt numb.Hermione stood over Astoria and Draco was on the other side of her. Hermione took in a deep breath and began to wave her wand around the magical rune."You're sure about this, Granger?" Draco inquired lowly."Positive." Hermione said breathlessly.Hermione cut along the rune and began to cleanse the blood surrounding the imprint. She ordered Draco to hand her certain tools that she would need to purify the poisoned blood. It was imperative to replace the poisoned blood with new blood, but it was tricky. Since Astoria was living with the rune for almost a year her blood was almost entirely dark, so to put fully purified blood into her system would cause her heart to fail. The vampire's blood is soiled with blood from light and dark, and it was the perfect specimen for Astoria.Hermione signaled for Draco to lift his wand and begin to persuade the dark magic bonded with Astoria's bones to wither and erase. Hermione was beginning to tire from separating the contaminated blood with the clean. After what seemed like an eternity, Hermione almost fully separated Astoria's blood and she was ready to replace it with the vampire's donation. Hermione flicked her wand and cracked the vile over Astoria's incision on her neck. The power within the rune absorbed the vampire's blood and within seconds Astoria's rune was beginning to dim, for the dark magic inside was fading."I think it is working. The blood is cleansed, now the bones need to be twisted and fused. I am going to need to break off the corrupted parts." Hermione said shakily as her hands were almost completely covered in blood.All the color was drained from Draco's face and every time Astoria heard him let out another deep breath her heart almost stopped. Astoria did not feel all what was happening to her, but she knew Draco was hanging on by a thread."Draco, dangle midst of dark magic over the rune. The rune will sense its presence and will be distracted as I try to carve the bones. Try and keep a steady hand we all know how your handy work- "Draco scoffed and gave Hermione a frightful look. "Bug off, Granger."It was coming the time when Hermione was beginning to twist the bones, bend them back and carve out the darkest imprints. Astoria felt the pressure in the back of her neck, but no immediate pain. Every so often she would feel Draco's hand caress her arm and she would twitch from nerves.After minutes of Hermione bending her bones, it was time for the reversal of the dark magic."It is time. Are you sure you want me to do this? It is not too late to turn back- ""Shut up and let's do it." Draco spat.Hermione and Draco guided their wands over the rune, the tension between the dark magic and the light of the wands was stricken. The magic within the rune was not budging, the magic was clinging onto every dark part of Astoria to stay alive."Twist this way. Come now!" Hermione ordered.Within an instant Astoria felt a sharp pain coursing around her neck and her limbs began to spasm. Astoria felt herself yelling, but nothing was coming out. She felt Draco holding her body down and she heard Hermione gasping to keep her focus. The spell that was being used for the reversal was powerful and Astoria felt every aspect of it.Astoria felt herself drifting back, the spots on her eyes becoming black and her chest becoming lighter. Astoria's eyes closed slowly and turned black.Astoria awoke on the ground in a dark forest. She was wearing her Beaxubaton uniform and her hair was touching her cheeks. Astoria rose and looked at her surroundings, she saw trees on one end and the Hogwarts castle on the other.Astoria walked slowly to the ends of the forest until she heard footsteps coming up behind her. She turned quickly, wand drawn and pointed out. What she saw before her was nothing she ever wanted to see. There was a woman who looked like her but was dressed in a black gown, hair touching her torso, and her eyes filled with darkness."Who are you!" Astoria yelled out while still pointing her wand at the woman.The woman cocked her head to the side and released a low laugh. The woman touched the tip of Astoria's wand and physically lowered it."Me? Why, I am you." The woman said bluntly."I can't find her heartbeat. Turn her over!"Astoria was hearing voices in her head and she was desperately trying to register what she was hearing in her head, and what the woman said to her. Astoria shook her head and looked at the woman more closely.They had the same eyes, body, hands, and sinister smile.Astoria was looking at the darkest part of herself, the woman the rune created, she threw her hands in the air and took off running. The woman let out a sinister laugh and raised her hands. Astoria was lifted into the air and peering up at her was the demon in her own body."Don't you leave me! Astoria!"Astoria recognized the voice in her head. She knew that cold, desperate, saddened voice. Then the woman began to speak again."You thought you could kill me? No, no, Astoria. The inferno starts with me." The woman said plainly.Astoria ascended back down to the ground and was left breathless. The woman kneeled before her and touched her chin."I will never be you." Astoria spat.The woman came closer and Astoria could feel the dark magic radiating off her. She would be lying to herself if she said it did not feel amazing."You already are." The woman whispered."RENNERVATE!"Astoria felt herself being pulled and her body flung back onto a table. She re-opened her eyes to see the broken-down walls of the Shrieking Shack and a hyperventilating Hermione standing before her. Draco was standing on the other side of her with his wand pointed."You're alive. We thought we lost you." Hermione said lowly.Astoria was trying desperately to process what had just happened. "Did it work?"Hermione shook her head and peered over at Draco. "The extraction magic was killing you. It made your heart stop. I am not sure if the spell was too difficult or- ""Try again." Astoria spat.Draco ran to her side and looked deeply into her eyes."Absolutely not. It is too dangerous. Are you mental?" Draco spat.Astoria sat up and looked at both intently."It is my body. I can handle it this time. We have come too far to give up." Astoria said boldly.Hermione peered at Draco with fearful eyes and was covered in blood up to her elbows. Draco's hair was disheveled, and all the color was drained from his already pale face."You have not seen what I have. I will not end up like that. Now TRY again." Astoria said assertively as she laid chest down on the table again.She heard Hermione huff and Draco curse under his breath. She needed this to be over. She saw what her future was going to entail, her becoming a monster. One more time, she thought to herself. Her body just needs to handle the extraction of the dark magic."Keep me awake this time." Astoria ordered.Hermione and Draco raised their wands over the rune and began to mutter the extraction spell. Once again, Astoria felt her limbs tremble and her chest becoming light, but this time it felt as if something was being pulled from her."Keep going." Hermione ordered Draco."Come on Astoria." Draco said.Astoria began to grip the table the pain from the extraction was beginning to feel like she saw sitting on a bed of needles. Then as she almost felt the magic of the rune begin to end, she heard a crash from the window."GET OUT OF HERE. Take Granger and go!"Astoria recognized that voice, it was Severus Snape. She felt her body being lifted but the pain had knocked her disoriented. The only thing on her mind was wondering if the magic was extracted."I will not leave her Professor!" Draco pleaded."They are coming, and they will kill you if they find out you had something to do with this. Take Granger and GO!" Snape roared."Come on Draco! We have to go!" Hermione pleaded."I WILL not leave her!" Draco yelled out.Astoria heard more windows being smashed in and then she heard small crack. She no longer heard Draco or Hermione's voice. She opened her eyes and saw Snape was carrying her."You stupid girl." Snape muttered under his breath.Astoria was whisked away by Snape and felt herself apparate somewhere else. She felt her body being levitated and the power of her rune beginning to dwindle. Did the magic work? She kept thinking to herself. She had no idea where she was or what was going to happen next. Meanwhile back at Hogwarts, Hermione apparated herself and Draco back on top of the astronomy tower. Draco's eyes were fuming, and he looked as if he was ready to punch Hermione's face inward. He gripped both her shoulders and yelled into her face."Do you have any idea what you just done! You made me leave HER!" He roared in her face.Draco felt himself shaking with fury and his eyes beginning to pool."I am sorry. But she made me promise to save you before her." Hermione said lowly."You are to listen to ME. NOT HER." Draco bellowed out.He punched the nearby wall and his knuckles split open."Draco, please... I..." Hermione started to say."Get the fuck out of my sight, Granger." Draco spat while cradling his split knuckles.Hermione ascended down the astronomy tower stairs and Draco leaned over the railing and screamed at the top of his lungs."I lost you." He whispered to himself.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997Draco sat in the astronomy tower until nightfall. The memories of Astoria's body in the clutches of Snape pestered his immediate thoughts. Draco began to pick at the open cuts on his knuckles and watch the blood spill down his arm, and past his dark mark."It's all your fault." He said speaking to the skull-locked mark on his forearm.Draco paced back and forth along the metal ground and as he was about to bash is good fist onto the wall, he heard footsteps on the stairwell. He stopped in his tracks and peered toward the stairs."What are you doing up here, mate? Tis' nearly two in the morning." Theo said while looking exhausted."Leave me alone, Nott. Right now, is not the time." Draco spat while leaning against the railing.Draco wanted to be alone with his thoughts, and wallow in self-pity. His coping strategies proved endlessly to be less prudent, but that never stopped him from denying help from his peers."Tell me what troubles you. You look like shit, Malfoy." Theo admitted.Draco scoffed and snorted. He began to laugh in defeat and peered up at Theo."I fucked up. It is my fault. I told her I would get her out of this servitude. I did the fucking opposite." Draco said while punching the wall once more with his already bloody knuckles.Theo ran over to try and stop his swinging arm, but Draco batted him off."IT'S MY FAULT!" Draco said as his chest began to heave, and he slid against the wall.Theo looked confused but was also trying to understand what Malfoy was explaining to him. Theo was aware of who Astoria was, and what her life-sentence was to the Dark Lord, however he was kept in the dark regarding the procedure in the Shrieking Shack."Where is Tori?" Theo asked slowly while trying not to set Malfoy off once more.Draco took a few deep breaths, gathered his thoughts, and peered up at his friend."He has her. Granger and I tried to help her remove the ancient rune and when we attempted to reverse the magic her heart almost stopped. We tried again, at her request, and then the windows smashed in and before I knew it, she was gone. Snape carried her away. I fucking let her go. Like the coward I am."Theo sat next to Draco and handed him a flask he carried in his pocket. Theo tended to keep a flask of fire whiskey on him, especially at night. Draco always suspected Theo had a touch of a drinking problem, but in this moment, Draco desperately needed some liquid relief.Draco took a long slug from the flask and handed it back to Nott. He felt the burning sensation coursing down his throat, but at this moment nothing bothered him. Not even the bloody cuts on his knuckles."Is she dead?" Theo asked lowly."I don't know." Draco said breathlessly.Draco felt his eyes begin to pool but his ego takes over his emotions. He shot up once more and gripped the railing with rage. He looked at Theo with intent as his friend began to stand up."I must find her." Draco said boldly."Let me help." Theo demanded.Draco shook his head and began to walk past Theo."Forget it. I love her, I will find her. Even if that means killing every man on the Dark Lord's council. She is mine." Draco spat.Draco felt it useless to attend his classes because the only thing on his mind was Astoria. He considered every place the Dark Lord would keep her away. It would be every place Draco was not permitted to enter. Draco was sitting in the library reading a book on Ancient Runes when he heard someone sit with him.He peered up to see it was Hermione Granger wearing her red, gold Gryffindor robes and carrying her satchel with books packed inside."Now is not a good time, Granger." Draco spat while peering back down at his book.Hermione leaned in to speak without the fear of someone overhearing their conversation."I came to check on you. You have not been attending your classes and- "Draco slammed his book shut and stared at Hermione with rage filled eyes."Do you honestly believe I can think about Muggle Studies while the woman I love could be very well dead, and there is nothing I can do!" Draco interjected sharply.Hermione immediately closed her mouth and sat in silence for another few minutes. Draco was annoyed that she was bothering him, but he would be lying if he said it was not a strange form of comfort having her there."Well, if you would hush up for one minute and let me explain why I am here." Hermione spat.Draco scoffed and cocked his head to the side."Do tell why you have blessed me with your presence." Draco said boldly.Hermione reached into her satchel and pulled out the parchment which had notes on Ancient Runes scribbled all over."I took Ancient Runes third year, and, in every language, words can be translated differently. Every line on a rune can be twisted to mean another word. When we were twisting Astoria's carved bones that symbol was called 'Othala' which obviously meant property." Hermione paused and pulled out another parchment that had information on runic mark which read 'Algiz.' "Draco, runic imprints cannot be removed without the servant's masters, but they can be manipulated. When we were twisting the carving, the runic mark transformed into the mark of Algiz. Algiz is the ancient rune of protection."Draco snatched both pieces of parchment from Hermione's grasp and tried his best to decipher the information she was relaying. He was half confused but half following along. Draco was trying to figure out how this information was pertinent to him finding Astoria."Okay... remind me how any of this matters? She is gone, Granger." Draco spat.Hermione rolled her eyes and let out a huff of frustration."She is under the protection of runic imprint itself." Hermione said boldly. "Therefor the dark magic within the rune will not harm her. It will aid her in healing and keep her mind open."Draco felt a weight come off his chest and he almost cracked a smile. The procedure was almost a complete success, the runic magic was no longer going to harm Astoria but instead protect her against dark magic. For the past few days Draco has been traveling to the dungeons to try and locate Professor Snape but he has not yet returned from kidnapping Astoria. This put Draco at less ease everyday Snape was absent."Where do you think Snape took her?" Hermione inquired.Draco sat back in his chair and crossed his arms."I dunno. Snape has been gone ever since otherwise I would have demanded an answer. I cannot return home because the Manor is crawling with Death Eaters. If I start asking questions, they will search my memories." Draco said lowly.Hermione began to peer around the library and then her face began to lift."That girl... that one girl she is always hanging around is engaged to a Death Eater, yes?" Hermione inquired sharply.Draco nodded and furrowed his brows. Hermione was talking about Lilla, but Draco was not very fond of her. But at the masquerade he learned of Lilla's arranged marriage to openly known Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov. Draco always felt that girl would end up with Theo, because of the way he was constantly pining for her. At the end of the day who are they to argue against the wishes of their parents? Draco did everything for his family and the people he loved most in the world. If it ever came down to his life or Astoria's he knew he would trade his for hers in a heartbeat. He just wishes he were given the option when the time came."That girl has to know something about where Astoria is. Find her, ask her, and then you are one step closer to getting Astoria back. I am here if you ever need me. You know that..." Hermione said lowly while trying to extend her hand, but Draco refused.Draco raced down to the dungeons and bursted into the Slytherin common room. It was surprisingly empty, and he charged into Lilla and Astoria's dormitory. When he walked through the door it was empty. The entire room was empty. Draco walked over to the dressers and looked inside, not even Hogwarts attire resided inside the drawers. He walked over to the window and peered out into the Black Lake and caught a glimpse of the Giant Squid in the distance. He felt hopeless, yet again. Lilla was gone and so was Astoria. Everything began to come down on him and he felt it was all his fault. At the end of the day Draco was the one to offer to reverse the runic magic, he just did not realize how many lives were going to change to achieve that goal.Draco heard the door open again and he noticed Pansy Parkinson standing in the doorway with a smirk on her face. He instantly felt annoyed and was not in the mood for Pansy to start talking smack."Hmm—did the two little girls from France finally return to where they belong? Thank god." Pansy spat.Draco rolled his eyes and began to walk past her until she grabbed his arm. Pansy peered into Draco's gray, rage riddled eyes and he investigated her lustful gaze."Hands off, Parkinson." Draco spat while freeing himself from Pansy's grip."She is gone, Draco, but I am here. Come now. You have had a mudblood, a whore and many mindless bobble-heads in this school. Have me once more. Don't you remember how it was?" Pansy said while trying to wrap her arms around Draco's neck.Draco swiftly put his hands around Pansy's neck and shoved her against the door."Never speak of Granger or Greengrass. I used you, Pansy. You were the whore that always made herself available. I burn for Astoria in ways you could never imagine. Now if you please- "He paused and released his grasp. "When did the other French girl leave?"Pansy's eyes began to pool, and he shoved Draco in the chest."You USED me Draco Malfoy! You pompous ass! You were one of my good friends and now you are nothing but a pussy-whipped death eater!" Pansy exclaimed while attempting to grab Draco's forearm that contained the Dark Mark.It all happened so fast. Draco's hand raised and it connected with Pansy's cheek. She fell to the floor and began to moan in pain. Draco vowed he would never hit a woman, but in this very moment he lost control. He immediately felt ill and attempted to aid Pansy. Pansy shoved him off and cursed under breath. She stopped dead in her tracks while holding her cheek."She-She- was escorted out yesterday. I was in the common room when I saw an older man carrying her bags. She looked distressed." Pansy finally said while running out of the room.Draco knew it had to have been Antonin who came and grabbed Lilla from her dormitory. He knew the Dubois' were no longer concerned with Lilla's whereabouts ever since the arranged marriage deal was final. Draco heard many things from Dolohov while sitting in on High Council meetings."You let me die. You promised you would always protect me. Why Draco?"Draco adjusted his eyes to focus in on what he was seeing. Astoria stood before him in a white laced flowing dress with blood running down her chest and arms. He noticed the bite marks that lined her arm and came to realize they were snake bites. He tried to rush by her side but with every step he took the farther she got."Astoria. I am sorry. I tried. You... you... were taken from me." Draco pleaded while falling to his knees.He looked down to his own forearm and noticed his Dark Mark beginning to move and dance around his skin. The dark magic that was radiating off Astoria was causing the Dark Mark to come alive."It's your fault I am dead. Your fault. Your faul- "Draco's eyes snapped open and noticed he was laying in his four-poster bed and was having a nightmare. He felt the sweat dripping from his forehead and quickly lifted his forearm to look at the Dark Mark. It was still there but it was stationary. He feared this was his subconscious telling him that Astoria was dead, and he needed to believe the worst.Draco awoke the next morning to find a letter attached to his owl's leg. He gave his dark colored owl a pet and took the tiny parchment from the bird. He noticed the 'M' wax seal and knew it was from his family. He opened the letter and recognized the handwriting instantly.          Draco,          Come home. Today.                    MotherDraco knew his mother did not call on him often, only when it was pressing matters. The last time he was summoned by her was the day Daphne Greengrass was taken into the Dark Lord's custody at Malfoy Manor. Draco quickly realized what Naricssa may have to discuss with him has something to do with Astoria. Perhaps she knew about her whereabouts and wanted to assist Draco with letting him know her location. Draco quickly dressed in his black suit and scurried down to the Slytherin common room fireplace.He gripped the Floo Powder in his hand and stood in the fireplace. He threw it down and stated his destination sternly. Within seconds flames filled his surroundings and he was plunged through his dining room fireplace at home.He was assisted withstanding up by his mother and to his surprise he saw his father, Lucius Malfoy standing by."I got your letter. Tell me what this is all about." Draco said boldly.Narcissa hugged her son tightly and put her hand in his hair. Draco also noticed her wearing the black diamond ring. The very ring that contained the true memories of Astoria the night in the Shrieking Shack. It gave Draco a cool comfort in knowing she was keeping it close to her. The night Draco lost Astoria he sent the ring to his mother and attached a note to it explaining what had happened, he never got a response."You were summoned because the Dark Lord is being persistent that you complete your task within the fortnight. The cabinet should be well repaired by now." Lucius spat.Draco gathered himself and quickly realized this visit was not about Astoria, but instead about his task to the Dark Lord. The one task he almost forgotten about but not entirely.Draco hesitated but answered slowly. "It is repaired. Tell them to be ready by tomorrow evening."Draco felt a pressure on his chest and his hands beginning to fist. He was not ready to complete this task and was physically making him ill thinking about it. He had known Dumbledore his entire life, but he needed to put his Occlumency to work and push those memories aside. Focus on what mattered. Completing the task and locating Astoria."Where is Severus?" Draco inquired lowly.Lucius furrowed his brows and put a hand on the fireplace. He let out a scoff."Is it any concern of yours boy?" Lucius said lowly while giving a smirk. "He was whisked away on a sudden urgency. I expect that he shall return to take Dumbledore's place when he... falls."Draco's eyes connected with his mothers and she kept fiddling with the black diamond on her hand. Lucius walked out of the room and apprated with a short crack.Narcissa immediately embraced her son once more and whispered in his ear."She is alive."Draco felt his heart lift and it felt almost as if he could breathe once more. He hugged his mother tightly and she took his hand. Narcissa led him over to nearby cupboard and handed her son a small box. Draco furrowed his brows and wondered what was inside. He opened it slowly and his heart began to feel again.Inside the tiny box was Astoria's snake emerald necklace. The one that contained her fondest memory of Draco and the one she constantly fiddled with across her neck."It was sent here with a note that read, 'Give this to Draco'. I assume it is from Snape. We got the news of what happened from Dolohov. Snape told the High Council that Astoria was being held against her will by snatchers and her runic was tortured. The Dark Lord believed Severus' story and he instructed him to take her away. However, her location remains a secret." Narcissa said lowly.Draco paced around the room with the necklace in hand. He could picture Astoria's hands playing with the dangled jewel and the concentration she would have while doing it. He had half a mind to replay the memory trapped inside but resisted."Why did he send me her necklace? Surely, she will know if it is not around her neck. The girl cannot keep her hands off it." Draco inquired.Narcissa gave her son a clueless facial expression and squeezed his hand once more."You had that mudblood assist you with Astoria did you not?" Narcissa inquired.Draco felt as if he was being cornered. He knew his mothers' views on bloody purity within families and friends, so he knew she was not happy when him and Hermione were shagging up once upon a time. Draco was undeniably close with his mother, due to his fathers' personality. He always had a soft spot in his heart for Narcissa and confided in her often, due to him not having many female friends to openly talk too."Granger is, I dare say, the greatest witch of my age. I needed someone I could trust with the woman I love. I could not do the procedure on my own. I- "Narcissa ran over and cupped his face."I understand. But you realize she is at greater risk than any of us. That girl is muggle-born and is the prime target for the Dark Lord's plan." Narcissa admitted.Draco was beginning to feel boggled. He feared what would happen if the Dark Lord won the upcoming battle, but he never figured that he would have a plan that involved muggle-borns. The pit in his stomach began to form again and he did not have a good feeling about Granger's future."Never mind that. I will protect Granger if I have too." Draco spat.Narcissa shook her head and slammed the box down."You cannot have both! There will come a time when you must choose. Astoria is not like that muggle-born witch. There will come a time when Astoria goes after her because that is what her master orders." Narcissa admitted.Draco slammed his hands on the table in frustration. Why did everyone assume he still cared for Granger? Was it obvious to everyone except him? He would always choose Astoria. No matter what she does or is ordered to do. They are bonded by dark and drawn together by the little light that lives within them.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997Before Draco could form another coherent thought Malfoy Manor began to flood with Death Eaters. Bellatrix LeStrange came bustling in with a mad like cackle, Antonin Dolohov strutted in with a suitcase, and so many more dark figures filed into the formal dining room. Lucius apparated back hurried toward his wife and son."Straighten up. The Dark Lord will be here any moment. An emergency meeting was called. Cissa let us go." Lucius stated coldly as he held out his cane guiding Narcissa into the dining room.Draco felt himself falter; his feet felt stuck in position until Bellatrix crept toward him. Her hair black, curly, and amiss as always. When she smiled her teeth stained yellow and rotted from lack of hygiene. All the years in Azkaban did a number on her appearance and mental state."There—he is! The boy of the hour!" Bellatrix said boldly while attempting to touch Draco's cheek, but he curved her hand."Aunt Bella." Draco said coldly while giving her a low nod.Draco took a seat next to his father at the dining table and locked eyes with the members of the council. He felt the urge to ask Dolohov where Lilla was, but he resisted. For it was too risky to show affection toward one of Astoria's friends, it may blow his cover of being uninvolved with her.The minutes that passed felt like hours until Wormtail scurried into the room. Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail) was a short, plump, and precautious little man. Wormtail's life revolved around caring for the Dark Lord and being his loyal servant, for he did not need a runic imprint to show his servitude."The Da-Dark Lord is her-here--!" Wormtail stated almost in a frightening way.When Draco peered his eyes over to the entrance, he saw Lord Voldemort. Voldemort was dressed in his usual black robes, no shoes, and the being followed by his pet snake, Nagini. Draco felt himself shutter when Nagini began to slither along the floor near his feet. Snakes never bothered him, but there was something about that snake that made Draco's blood thin."Welcome my friends. I am pleased to have you all here. I am sure you are wondering why I have summoned you. As I am sure you have noticed we are missing an important friend, Severus. Severus is off on important matters tending to an important benefactor to our future together." Voldemort paused and for a slight moment he glared into Draco's eyes.Draco felt his heart skip a beat, but he never broke eye contact. If he broke the eye contact it would show weakness, and that he had something to hide. Only a select few know the truth regarding the depth of Draco and Astoria's relationship. Still in these times Astoria belonged to Lord Voldemort. Hermione and Draco may have switched the dark magic so it could not harm Astoria further, but it is impossible to sever the bond unless it is done by Voldemort himself. The thought of Astoria never fully having her freedom made Draco rethink his entire purpose. He only ever wanted to protect her from the mess her parents created for her."Now... tomorrow will be the most promising day in Wizard history. The infamous Albus Dumbledore will fall, and we will be free to begin our good work. This will be all thanks to this wonderful boy." Voldemort stood behind Draco's chair and flared his hands around his head.The council members continued to discuss how Severus will take his place as headmaster, what will happen to Hogwarts after the Death Eaters take over the grounds and more importantly, where Draco will reside once he completes the assassination. Draco knew once he committed the deed that he was going to need to be put into seclusion, so he is not whisked away by the Ministry and sent off to Azkaban for murder. After many banters of where Draco should spend his time while preparing for the final battle between Potter and Voldemort it was decided that he should be sent to France.Draco was not thrilled with the idea of being sent off to France, but in the back of his mind he was deciding on plans of how he could turn his seclusion into developing plans for finding Astoria. Draco knew the Beauxbaton Academy of Magic was in France and perhaps Astoria was sent back there to finish up her schooling and forced into hiding. There was a glimmer of hope that swept over Draco and all he needed to do now was compete the deed.The meeting concluded by Voldemort ordered for everyone to leave him and Draco alone for a few minutes. Apparently, there was more that needed to be discussed by the Dark Lord and Draco.Draco kept his cool, kept his posture stiff and was going to answer accordingly to anything Lord Voldemort inquired about."My dear... boy. I see worry in your face. Do not tell me you are going to falter when the time comes." Voldemort said lowly while pacing behind Draco's chair.Draco swallowed but kept his face expressionless."Of course, not my Lord. I consider it a great honor to serve you in anyway you see fit." Draco said coldly while trying to keep his heart rate steady and his hands to his knees.There were a few silent moments and then he felt the slither of Nagini around his feet. It was almost impossible not to fidget and move his feet from her body, but he needed to appear strong."If I searched your memories my boy who would I see in the front of them?" Voldemort said plainly while waving his wand around his crusted fingers.Draco felt cornered because he knew the one thing on his mind was Astoria. It was always Astoria who took the front row seat in Draco's mind. It was too late to perform occlumency and push her memories back, so Draco needed to answer swiftly and plainly."The task at hand." Draco said without emotion.Voldemort cocked his head and pointed his wand at Draco's head. Draco braced for the impact of legilimency but quickly realized nothing was happening. Still with his face showing no emotion his gaze met Voldemort's. Voldemort was smirking and lowly chuckling."I think otherwise. I think I might see a certain woman. A woman who is beautiful but destined for a future..." Voldemort paused and was an inch from Draco's face. "...that does not involve you."Draco felt his hands begin to fist and the sweat forming on his top forehead. His heart rate was beginning to rise and all he wanted was to force an answer of Astoria's whereabouts from the Dark Lord. He was curious about how much Voldemort knew about their relationship."My Lord I do not have any woman of interest in my life. My life currently revolves around completing my task to the best of my ability. Astoria and I were merely classmates, and we have mutual mates. Nothing more." Draco said plainly but as he could see Voldemort's expression, he was not buying it."If you fail my boy... everyone you love will perish." Voldemort got close to his face once again and whispered. "That includes her."The next morning Draco awoke in his four-poster bed with Nott sleeping in the next bed and Zabini across the way. He rolled over in his bed and for a split second he saw her eyes looking back at his. Her big beautiful brown eyes filled with sadness looking back at his. Draco blinked and she was gone. Astoria was constantly on his mind and he often found that his mind played tricks on him. Sometimes when he was sitting in the library, he would see a short, Slytherin female with blond hair walking by and he found himself hoping to see Astoria's face, but it was never her.The thoughts of what was going to happen tonight consumed Draco. It ate away at his mind, body, and soul. Some nights he found himself waking up and quivering with anxiety. The weight of his mother, father and Astoria's life on his shoulders dwelled over him. He needed to express how he felt, and no person would understand.Draco rolled out of bed, grabbed a notebook, a quill and strolled out of the dorm and plopped a squat in the Slytherin common room. Even though it was June the fire still roared in the common room and it made the air feel cozy. The dungeon air was often chilled and was not susceptible to the warmth of sunlight. It was nearly six in the morning, but Draco desperately needed some relief. He strolled over to the secret bar area where the students hid cheap firewhiskey, he took the bottle. Draco sat on the couch and took several slugs before he pulled out a piece of parchment and began to write to the only person who will understand.          Astoria,          I have no one else to write to, and I cannot even send this to you. You may not even ever get to read this, but here it is. Tonight, is the night I am destined to assassinate a man who has taught me, scolded me, and shown me great wisdom throughout the years. I need to protect the people I love. Well, fuck, I never really have a choice in my life. You can surely understand that. If I ever get to tell you anything it will be this. I never intended on losing you. We were taken from each other and I punish myself everyday for letting you slip through my fingers. I miss your sarcastic mouth and my hands in your hair. I miss the smell of your skin when you freshly bathed. I miss watching you paint. I even miss hearing you sing to that merlin-awful music. Wherever you are I hope you are thinking of me as often as I think of you.          D.M.Draco took the letter and had an intention of burning it but instead he tucked it back into his notebook with the hopes that one day Astoria would get to read it.Hours had passed since morning and it was time for the Vanishing Cabinet to become useful. Draco stood at the foot of the vanishing cabinet and muttered the charm to open the gateway from Borgin & Burkes (where the sister cabinet presided) and Hogwarts. Draco felt a twinge of fear when the cabinet doors began to open and black smoke seethed through. In this moment Draco had every thought to seal the gateway, make sure the Death Eaters could not pass, but then, as always, Astoria entered his mind. If Draco somehow fiddled with the Dark Lord's plan to take over Hogwarts either Narcissa or Astoria would be his first target to harm Draco. Draco pushed those thoughts out of his mind and ran out of the Room of Requirement.He ascended the Astronomy Tower staircase to find a wounded Dumbledore clutching the railing."Pleasant evening, Draco. Are you out here enjoying the night air?" Dumbledore said lowly while clutching his wand at his side.Draco's expression was cold, and his wand pointed at Albus Dumbledore. His first thought was to cast the killing curse and be done with it. Draco felt his wand begin to falter. He knew his wand was embedded with unicorn hair and it was resistant to dark magic.Dumbledore began to raise his wand and Draco yelled."Expelliarmus!"Dumbledore's wand flew across the room and hit the wall. The old wizard was left defenseless and then he cocked his head to the side. Albus began to walk slowly over to Draco with a warm grin on his face."Draco you are no assassin."Draco began to walk backward but with his wand still pointing up at the old man. The sweat began to pour off his forehead and his hands began to shake. He was no assassin, and he did not want to kill this great wizard. Then he began to hear the rustling of footsteps from below."I am sorry, Professor. I must do this. I have to kill you, or he is going to kill her." Draco squeaked out.Dumbledore lowered his head and reached into his robes pocket. He pulled out a tiny vile and a small scroll attached. The old man held out his hand with the vial and gave the blond a small reassuring smile. Draco with his wand still pointed, but lowered, he reached forward and took the vial. The small label read, "The inevitable inferno."Draco furrowed his brows and then looked up at his old headmaster."Protect her from what she may become. You only have each other." Dumbledore whispered.Draco heard the footsteps getting further up the stairs and the final decision was at hand. He raised it wand, pointed it at his old headmaster, closed his eyes and muttered, "Avada Kadavra."Draco felt a single tear roll from his eye and hit his cheek. His chest felt lightened somehow and the Dark Mark twinged on his forearm. As he saw before him laid Albus Dumbledore, the greatest wizard of our time, on the floor cold, and it was Draco's fault."WELL, DONE DRACO!"Draco heard the screeching of Bellatrix from the stairwell, and she began to dance around the Astronomy Tower. Draco felt his mind begin to fog, and his body became numb. He did not know who he was anymore. The power of the unforgivable curse was coursing through his veins and giving power to his Dark Mark. For a mere moment he felt his wand begin to crack and the light within dwindle. He feared the little light that was left within him he just assassinated.When Draco and the other Death Eater ascended back down the stairs, waiting at the foot was Severus Snape. Draco's eyes bulged and his pulse began to race. Snape knew where Astoria was, and he has been with her the entire time Draco has not been.Snape followed the rest out onto the grounds and Draco yanked on his arm and looked him in the eyes."Where is she!" Draco demanded.Snape pulled his arm free, and his face was cold."Do not worry yourself about people who do not concern you, Draco." Snape spat.Draco felt the rage building up within him. The dark magic that was coursing through his veins was making him feel more rageful than ever. Draco raised his wand to Severus' face and Snape paused in his stance."What are you going to do? Kill me as well?" Snape said in a mocking tone.Draco raised his upper lip and began to breathe heavier than ever. In one moment, he wanted to use a killing curse and in another he wanted to let Snape go."Tell me where she fucking is! You stole her from me!" Draco spat not lowering his wand.Snape began to laugh lowly and then shoved Draco's wand from his face."Young Astoria was not stolen from you, dear boy. I rescued her. She was being tortured, remember?" Snape said lowly.Draco felt his eyes begin to falter and his stomach begin to sink. Snape knew everything that went on and he was trying to protect Draco from the Dark Lord discovering the truth. The truth of the fact that Draco was attempting to reverse the magic set-in place by Astoria's master."She—she tell me where she is. She needs me." Draco said pleadingly."Astoria does not need you; you need her." Snape spat.Draco knew he was right, he felt empty without Astoria. Nothing mattered anymore if she was not by his side. Draco still had a plan of searching for her and he was going to do it with or without Severus' aid.THE DAILY PROPHETJuly 1, 1997ALBUS DUMBLEDORE MURDERED!The once greatest wizard of our time has been murdered on June 30, 1997 by Lucius Malfoy's only son, Draco Malfoy.

    Chapter Text
    September 1997Paris, FranceA terrace looking out into the streets of mindless muggles, with their obscenely awful conversations and dreadfully awful clothing. A mirror with the middle smashed in that now showed the reflection eight times over. A gaudy rug sprawled across the floor that was now covered with empty bottles of whiskey and gin. The four-poster bed in the middle of the room that was never made properly. And finally, a lonely desk that was accompanied by two bookshelves. Upon the desk laid lonely letters, unfinished thoughts, and shredded pieces of parchment."Get the fuck out of my bloody room." Draco spat while throwing one of the empty gin bottles at the door.Draco has been in seclusion (for his "safety") for almost two months, and it is safe to say his time in isolation has been eating away at him. After the assassination of Dumbledore, Lord Voldemort found it prudent to have Draco removed from Britain straight away. The Ministry of Magic has been on high alert to capture Draco since it was discovered he was the assassin. Lord Voldemort has been alternating members of his council to guard Draco's door, so he is not able to travel anywhere without an escort. Draco was having difficulty adjusting to the constant company.He spent many days sitting out on the terrace and observing the awfully boring people that walked below him. Their many conversations put him in an even worse mood than he usually is.Draco has read so many novels that his mind was busting with information, and just as he thinks he has finished off the bookshelves, they spawn more literature. He thought as if it was a running gag to cause insanity. The bookshelves were never empty, therefor he should not feel empty, but he did.The night at the Astronomy Tower was on constant replay in his mind. The final words Dumbledore spoke to him before Draco took his life, "Astoria does not need you; you need her." That constant statement ate away at his thoughts. Draco found himself writing more letters to Astoria explaining the situation but then ripping them up and flying them off the terrace.Draco did not enjoy venturing out around Paris with an escort, so he stuck to the few walls of the apartment. For the first month he came to terms with that for now he would have to be here so he would not get sentenced to Azkaban, but in many ways, he was in a prison of his own. The prison Lord Voldemort built for him, and the prison of his own mind. When Draco looked in the mirror, he did not recognize himself anymore, so he smashed it to pieces. Now when he peers into mirror, he views eight of an unknown, pale, blond figure staring back at him.The door of his apartment began to creek open once more and Draco became more furious this time around."I said... get the FUCK OUT!" Draco said while attempting to slam the door shut on who he thought was guarding the door."Hey, Mate easy!" Theo said while shoving the door open.Draco was taken aback, for he had not seen Theo since before the procedure on Astoria. To say he was glad to see a friend from home was an understatement, but his ego took over his emotion."What the bloody hell are you doing here, Nott?" Draco said while grabbing a bottle of firewhiskey off the bar cart."I am here to keep you company during your erm—hidin' out time." Theo said lowly.Draco sat on an armchair and took slugs of his bottle every few seconds."I do not understand if you are here then—"Theo proceeded to roll his sleeve up to reveal his forearm. His forearm bared the Dark Mark and Draco realized that his best friend was now a Death Eater.Draco's face shuttered and he threw the bottle against the wall. He shot up and trotted out onto the terrace. Draco stretched his arms out on the railing and was trying his best to keep his composure. He did not want his best friend to bare the burden he did. The curse of being tethered to another human being for the rest of your life. Draco felt guilty for losing Astoria but now he feared about losing his best friend to the same Lord."Mate, it is alright." Theo said while putting his hand on Draco's shoulder."NO. It is not alright. Why the fuck did you get the mark?" Draco spat.Theo ruffled his hair with his hand and let out deep breath."I didn't have a choice. I volunteered to be your 'isolation buddy'. I uhm—heard that Lilla might also be hidden away in France. I got wind of her being returned to the Beauxbaton Academy."Draco cocked his head and scoffed."You're keen on that French girl with the sharp tongue? She is not bad looking, if you are into that sorta' thing." Draco huffed.Theo shoved Draco lightly. "Watch it. Lilla is an extraordinary woman. Plus-hey—you are one to talk. Weren't you the one who was fucking the insufferable know-it-all from Gryffindor?" Theo inquired and smirked.Draco let go the terrace and strutted back inside. He did not like to think about Granger while he was here, Draco was doing his best with keeping his mind set on Astoria. Draco would never admit it to himself that in many ways he did miss Hermione Granger. Everything inside Draco was complicated, except for the fact that he loved Astoria, but he was also missing Granger. These thoughts kept his eyes open all hours of the night. The conversation Draco had with his mother and when she told him that one day he was going to have to choose, but it was never a choice, it will always be Astoria."Hey—come now. I know the Granger girl is a sensitive topic for you- ""Fuck off, Nott." Draco spat.Draco never went into detail with Theo about what happened with Hermione. Nott only knew that Draco was fucking her for a while, and that she felt a form an attachment toward him.Theo then proceeded to walk around Draco's living space and as he walked his face fell more and more. Theo walked over to Draco's desk and pulled out the letters he was writing, many addressed to Astoria."What's all this?" Theo inquired handing Draco the half-written letters.Draco snagged them and crumpled them."Those are none of your concern. If the only reason you were sent here is to 'cheer me up' then you can kindly get the fuck out of my apartment."Theo crossed his arms and stood in position. The silence was deafening but finally Draco broke it."Erm—since you are uhm—yeah—has there been any news on Astoria?" Draco said hesitantly.Theo looked down at him and shook his head lightly. Draco nodded and reached for a half-empty firewhiskey bottle on the floor. Draco knew there was nothing Theo could do to lift his spirits, but he did appreciate his presence. In many ways it was helping him, but not enough to show difference."Mate, honestly, her situation does not look promising. I have heard rumors that she is being trained, and I could not help but noticing your lunatic of an Aunt Bella has been missing ever since you left."Draco peered up and furrowed his brows."Training? What could they possibly be training her for?"Theo shrugged and took a seat on the floor across from Malfoy."I took it upon myself to visit Dolohov. I had to see for myself if Lilla was there. I told him I was there on 'business' but as I checked around his estate there was no sign of her." Theo huffed and put his face in his hands.Draco sympathized with his best friend because he knew what it was like to lose someone who means the world to you, especially if they are not dead. Draco sometimes wished that Astoria were dead because in many ways grieving her would be easier than missing her. The thoughts of where she is, what she is doing, who is with her and if she was being treated properly consumed him."I leave tomorrow for the Beaxubaton Academy. You are coming with me. Perhaps Astoria and Lilla are both there, one can only hope." Theo said lightly while shaking his head.The thought of Astoria being at the Beaxubaton Academy gave him a glimmer of hope. In many ways Astoria may have been sent back so she could resume school and steer clear of anyone from Britain, especially Draco. Draco hoped that at least Lilla would show up in the academy because he wanted his friend to have happiness, even if Draco was miserable.Draco nodded his head and handed his friend the firewhiskey bottle. They both cheered and drank until the wee hours of the night."Rise and shine, Malfoy. It is time to find our girls." Theo said joyfully.Draco's head was slightly pounding by the amount of whiskey that was leftover in his system, but he hurried to dress and downed a sobriety potion. Draco tended to keep sobriety potions on hand these days since there was not much to do in isolation besides drink, write or read.Theo stepped out of the room and informed the guard that he would be taking Draco out for a while, and that he would be safe in his care. Theo returned in and inside his hand he held out a blue ribbon. The long blue ribbon was the portkey for the Beauxbaton Academy since blue was their signature color. Both men grabbed hold of the ribbon and before they knew it, they were walking slowly down onto a grassy field."Where the bloody hell- "Draco began to say before he turned his head.Behind him stood a large, white castle-like building. Surrounding the castle were stone paths leading to flower gardens, great large pink trees and parked in front was a carriage hitched up to four white horses. Draco almost gagged at the sight of all the pink and femininity. He had not seen this much pink since fifth year in Defense Against the Dark Arts with Professor Umbridge."I think I may vomit." Draco spat.Theo rolled his eyes and started walking towards the castle. As Draco and Theo got closer to the entrance, they noticed the girls walking along the grounds. Many of them look the same, the blue skirted uniforms, perfectly quaffed hair and rosy cheeks. Draco could not help his wandering eyes for he noticed quite a few attractive girls, and he saw Theo's eyes wandering as well. Draco always knew he had a liking for French girls, which is why he chose to fall in love with Astoria. She was part French, talented, skilled, beautiful and had a snarky tongue. Who could want more for a girl?Before Draco and Theo could pass through the gates, they were halted by a knight statue who was guarding the gates."Who desires to enter the Beauxbaton Academy of Magic!" The knight stated in a dramatic French accent.Draco nudged Theo to step forward. "We wish to speak with your headmaster."The knight scoffed and crossed his arms. "Our headmistress Madame Maxime does not see anyone unless they are announced." The knight stated and then returned to his frozen stance."Let us the fuck in." Draco spat.The knight stood frozen, ignoring Draco's hurtful tone. Draco was just about to shove the door open when a hand grabbed his."Can I help you?"Draco yanked his hand free from the young woman and he looked at her with disgust. She had blond hair, blue eyes, and rosy cheeks."Yes. We want to see your headmaster. Right now." Draco demanded.The girl laughed and crossed her arms. She seemed to be a strong-willed woman who has seen a lot in her day and was not about to be pushed around by some schoolboys stomping their feet."I am afraid it is impossible. Madame Maxime is out."Theo cocked his head back in frustration and slammed the wall."Can I be of service? I am in charge of the academy when Madame Maxime is away." The girl said lightly."Perhaps you can. We require just a few minutes of your time." Theo said while trying to sound sincere.The girl led Draco and Theo out into one of the nearby flower gardens and conjured up a few chairs."Now erm—Miss—" Theo began to say."Fleur Delacour. Call me Fleur if you wish." Fleur said while extending her hand warmly."Alright—well Fleur, we are looking for two women.""Then you have come to the right school I must say." Fleur said sharply while leaning back in her chair.Draco rolled his eyes and sat forward. He had had enough of the fun and games he wanted answers."We are both looking for girls, who used to go here. We have reason to believe they have been sent back." Draco said lowly.Fleur furrowed her brows and looked intrigued. "Tell me their names if you please."Theo leaned forward and folded his hands. "Lilla Dubois and Astoria Greengrass."Fleur's eyes bulged from her head and she looked at the men sharply. She was silent for a mere moment before she spoke again."Lilly and Tori? I know those girls. Astoria was like a little sister to me. I have not spoken to her in a few years. I am not sure if you know this, but I was in the TriWizard Tournament and- ""You are the Beauxbaton champion!" Theo exclaimed boldly.Fleur nodded and continued. "After the games concluded I traveled to Romania to study dragons. I had returned these past few months to assist Madame Maxime with the girls. Where is Astoria? Is she alright? What about Lilla?" Fleur inquired with a worried tone.Draco bowed his head and he realized that Astoria nor Lilla was here. A journey wasted, time wasted and now he was back to square one of trying to find her."I am not sure if she is okay. We just need to find her." Draco said pathetically as he reached into his pocket to feel Astoria's emerald necklace. Often, he would twiddle the chain between his fingers and imagine it around her neck. Draco pulled out the necklace so he could hold it in his hands and Fleur's eyes shot open."You have her necklace?" She exclaimed loudly.Draco nodded but kept the gold chain in his hand."It was sent to me. I am not sure why." Draco said as he held up the snake wrapped emerald necklace.Fleur leaned forward."I think I may be able to assist you. May I see her necklace?" Fleur asked as she held out her hand.Draco was hesitant but he glared at Theo, Theo gave him a nod of reassurance and he placed the necklace into Fleur's hand. Fleur held the necklace tightly in her hands for a few minutes before he faces lifted."I might be able to sense where she is by holding her necklace. I have a keen sense for divination and sometimes holding a possession gives me indications."Draco looked at Theo and his face remained expressionless. Draco did not give much hope for this French witch. He barely knew her, but she knew Astoria. Draco did not understand the bond between Astoria and Fleur. Fleur was the sister; Daphne never was to Astoria. Draco saw in Fleur's eyes how worried she was about Astoria's whereabouts, so hopefully she could see something.Fleur clutched the necklace tight and muttered some Latin incantations. Draco was not a fan of Divination, so he did not pay attention much to what she was muttering."I see colors. Dark colors. I am seeing blues, reds, black and greens. I see the colors blending toget-PAINTING. I see her paintings. Oh, she is a gorgeous painter, do you not agree?" Fleur inquired.Draco knew how talented Astoria was with her paintings. He often missed watching her in the night while she carefully critiqued herself or her color choices. He longed for the first night he ever saw her paint. The painting of the girls alone with the sky. She was the girl in the canvas."Wherever she is she is painting it is by the water... However—I am sensing Dark Magic. I do not understand..." Fleur said and then she muttered one more incantation. Her eyes bulged from her head. "I can feel her hand motions. How she sways on the canvas, but I can also feel the vibration of Dark Magic. Why? Why is she involved with dark magic!" Fleur said as she stood up abruptly."Easy. There. Therefore, we are trying to rescue her." Theo said quickly.Fleur furrowed her brows. "RESCUE?"Draco rolled his eyes and looked at Theo."Do you know where she is? Can you FEEL where she is or some shit?" Draco asked quickly.Fleur flared her arms and began to raise her voice more."I am not sure! Go somewhere where there is a lot of painting, I do not know! That is all I can sense! I am not psychic!" Fleur stated. "It is time for the both of you to exit the grounds." Fleur said as she pointed to the exit. She flicked her wand and apparated away."Well—that was a waste of time!" Draco spat as he began to hasten down towards the exit.He noticed countless Beauxbaton Girls staring at him and Theo as they walked off the grounds."Bonjour!""Bonjour monsieur!" A few of the girls called out.Draco and Theo ignoring them all and irritated by the journey they decided to apparate back to Paris. The guys gripped the ribbon and were standing outside Draco's building apartment."We found out nothing.  What the fuck—mate." Draco said as she sat on the curb.Theo sat next to him and nudged Draco. "Malfoy, that girl said Astoria is painting by the water. Do you not understand?"Draco cocked his head and looked at Theo like he was a zoo animal. Painting by the water could mean countless places."Where has Astoria always wanted to go and paint?" Theo inquired.Draco looked up and his eyes bulged from his head. The one place Astoria always wanted to learn about art and paint to her heart's desire."Italy." Draco said lowly.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997 – Paris, FranceDraco felt Astoria's body pushed up against his, the heat radiating off her physique was intoxicating. He fisted her scalp with sure force and allowing her to moan as proudly as she liked. Draco pushed deeper and deeper into her and with every thrust Astoria cocked her head back. Astoria connected their lips and peered into Draco's eyes. Draco always adored looked into Astoria's eyes, they were big, brown, and always looked as if they were full of secrets."Do you love me?" Astoria breathlessly said in between kisses.Draco connected their lips once more and pushed Astoria on her back. He ran his hand up the side of her body until his hand was brushing just below her sternum."You know I do." He whispered to her before connecting their lips once more.Draco kept his eyes closed as he kissed her passionately. He continued to thrust into her, with his eyes closed and when he reopened them another familiar face appeared before him causing him to jolt."Miss me?" Hermione murmured lowly into Draco's ear.Draco eye's rushed open and he found himself in his four-poster bed, sweating profusely with an outstanding erection. Draco peered over his bed and noticed Theo snoozing on the living room sofa. Draco laid back down and began to breathe slowly. He realized he had been having a sex dream about not one, but two women. It had been a long while since he has intimate thoughts about Granger, but he did not understand why it was happening. Sexually, he was more attracted to Astoria then Hermione. Astoria had the figure, the blond hair, the sharp tongue, and she knew how to carry herself like a bad-ass woman. Hermione had brown frizzed hair, an insufferable need to be smarter than everyone else and was in many ways, annoying to be around. Draco decided to resume his sleep and hopefully not dream about anymore women for the rest of the night.When the afternoon arrived, Theo was out smoking on the terrace and Draco smelt it from rooms away. In a strange way it was a comfort to smell the scent of a cigarette again because it reminded him of Astoria. Although he absolutely despised smoking, it was still a strange comfort."We need to devise a plan mate, tis' not like we can walk into Italy and ask where Astoria is. We cannot afford to be recognized." Theo said while flicking the bud off the terrace.Draco pondered deeply about how they were going to get to Italy. Draco had a guard dog at his door, and it was not going to be easy to get past one of Voldemort's henchmen. The men discussed how they were going to take several portkeys into Venice and work their way from there, but it was leaving Paris was the tricky part of the plan. Would they sneak out in the cover of night? Would they kill the henchmen that was guarding the apartment door that night? It was not like they had invisibility cloaks to hide themselves under whenever they wanted to be oblivious to the world."I have a thought." Theo said lightly. "What about Polyjuice potion?"Draco's attention was grasped, and his eyes were in tentful. "The potion only lasts an hour.""We can brew more than we will need. Once we are in certain parts of Italy, we, well you, will not be recognized." Theo said proudly.Draco thought about how this could work. They would have to pull some random French men off the street, strip them of a few hairs and assume their identities for a while. Draco was dreading the thought of becoming someone else, he was quite fond of his blond and pale perfection."The potion is complicated. I have never brewed Polyjuice before, and if we mess it up, well---we die."Draco put his head in his hands and thought about who would be smart enough to brew Polyjuice potion."Granger. Granger can brew the potion. She has done it once before in Second Year. She told me all about it."Theo was nodding his head and was looking in more high spirits now that they had someone who could potentially fix the potion for them. However, Theo knew something that Draco did not. Theo knew for a fact that Granger was not at Hogwarts, he did not know where she was, but he took note of her absence."That may be a problem." Theo admitted lowly.Theo then proceeded to explain to Draco how Hermione never returned to Hogwarts and he also noticed that Harry Potter and Ron Weasley were also absent. Theo told Draco that he found it suspicious that the golden trio took off part of seventh year, but he shrugged it off."Another woman we lost track of. We will never find her." Theo said while throwing his cigarette off the terrace.Draco trotted into his room and went searching for the one item he knew Hermione would forever carry on her. The broken mirror piece Draco gifted to her in the summer between fourth and fifth year. If Hermione ever needed Draco all she would have to do was hold up the mirror and he would know to come to her aid, the same works both ways. Draco rummaged through one of his bags and muttered "Accio mirror" and the shattered (but strangely intact) mirror appeared in his hand. Theo came rushing in after his friend and looked at the shattered mirror with confusion."You kept that mirror? Are you mental? If Astoria knew you have a direct line to- ""Shut up, Nott. Astoria knows, sh – she is just unaware that the mirror works in my favor as well. Look, we need Granger to brew this bloody potion. You and I are much too capable of poisoning ourselves before we even step foot out the door."Draco held the mirror up to his face and in the distance, he could see Hermione's curly brown hair taking up most of the space. He muttered, "I need you" and placed the mirror back down."What if she refuses?""She won't." Draco admitted.In many ways Draco felt ashamed of himself for thinking about Hermione as much as he does these days. On many nights when he would sit on his terrace in solitude, he felt his mind faltering back to the summer of 1995."Would you please just eat the bloody candy?" Hermione said as she handed Draco a box of Every Flavor Beans.Draco closed his eyes and stuck his hand into the box of beans, completely unaware of the flavor he was taking. When he took a yellow bean out, he looked at it with disgust."This better be lemon." Draco spat before popping it into his mouth.The flavor was not lemon, but ear wax. He spit it out onto the floor and coughed while Hermione giggled softly."You think that is humorous?" Draco snarled.Hermione nodded as she began to eat the beans while still lowly laughing. Draco pounced onto Hermione and connected their lips passionately. He cupped her face with his hands and breathed in the scent of her hair."Someone is affectionate today..." Hermione whispered."I suppose you bring out the affection, Granger." Draco whispered once more before kissing her again.When Draco tasted her lips, it was sure bliss. All his worries dissolved, and he felt like a normal man for a change. He did not have to act a certain role for anyone."Tell me you're mine." Draco spat.Hermione flipped Draco over and straddled him. Her lips centimeters from his."I will always be yours." She admitted lowly.Draco and Theo were out on the terrace when the letter arrived. It was strapped to black owl that had a scrunched face. Draco tore the letter off the owl's leg and read aloud.Meet me in front of the Eiffel Tower. Seven O'clock.HIt was nearly six in the afternoon and the men decided to get a jump on the Eiffel Tower. To avoid suspicion Theo told the Death Eater guard that he would be accompanying Draco to a nearby muggle pub.Draco was becoming nervous as he found himself looking at his watch every half minute. Theo suggested that Draco take a drag of his cigarette to calm his nerves, he refused. Draco was wondering how Hermione was going to show up in Paris. Would she portkey? If she were near, would she apparate? Draco would be lying to himself if he said he was not slightly excited to see Hermione since it has been a long while.Theo tugged on Draco's suit sleeve and made his attention swerve to a nearby lady with curly brown hair, a tan trench coat and a black dress underneath. When she lady looked up her eyes met Draco's. Draco knew those eyes anywhere."Well, I am here. What do you require of me this time for your little Death Eater girlfriend?" Hermione spat.Draco scoffed and snorted. He got close to Hermione to speak to her lowly."I would watch the tone and watch your language. You never know who is lurking in the shadows." Draco spat.Hermione rolled her eyes and looked disgustingly at Theo like she has just seen an unpleasant bug that needed to be squashed quickly."Come." Draco spat.Draco led Theo and Hermione to a nearby muggle pub so their conversation would be safe from listening ears. When they all had their cocktails, Draco began to ask his favor."I need your help." Draco admitted.Hermione scoffed and sipped on her martini. "Huh – there is one I have never heard before." She said sarcastically."Granger – please. I do not ask much- ""You have asked the world of me!" She belted. "You have asked me to perform a procedure on your girlfriend that put my life at risk, I did it. You asked me to meet you in France, I left Harry and Ron for you! Now what do you want from me? Do I dare say, you want me to risk my life once more?"Draco and Theo looked at each other like they were losing a chess game. They made their moves carefully, but Hermione was playing rough. She was breaking out all her signature moves first to win the game. Draco analyze the situation carefully. He needed to talk to Hermione in a way for her to see reason and not lash out quickly.Draco leaned in and explained to her about how he and Theo traveled to the Beauxbaton Academy, about Fleur, and what she saw. Then he proceeded to tell her about the plan for Italy, but they needed the potion. Hermione looked at him and lowered her head. She huffed."I cannot help you. Draco, I have heard things. Terrible things, regarding Astoria. If I help you find her, I am condemning your life. You still have a chance to leave. You still- "Draco's eyes guided Hermione's to under the table. Draco lifted his sleeve to reveal his Dark Mark. Hermione gasped with her hand over her mouth and her eyes pooled. She instantly took Draco's hand, but he snatched it back."Do not feel sorry for me. I made my own path."Hermione was catching her breath, but her face told her emotion. Draco knew that Hermione thought that he was safe from the Death Eaters but how could he be when his entire family was in the council."I did not want to believe the Daily Prophet when they said... when they- ""Why do you think I am Paris? For my own pleasure? I am in fucking hiding, Granger, but enough about me. Can we- "Hermione rose from her seat abruptly and began to make a sprint for the door. Draco shot up and followed her outside. He seized her by the arm."Get off me! You murderer!"Draco guided her towards an empty ally way and hoped she would see reason. Draco did not murder Dumbledore by choice, but because he was forced too."I had to. The Dark Lord said he would kill her. I cannot live without her, Granger. Please help me find her."Hermione began to pace, and her eyes pooled more. Her breathing became heavier with every heave and she shoved Draco on his chest. He grabbed both her wrists and he looked into her tear-filled eyes."Astoria is a monster! HE will make her one! The Prophecy spoke of a woman who would bring fire from the sky! IT IS HER!""ENOUGH! She is no monster! Astoria is the woman I love!" Draco spat.Hermione shoved Draco to the wall and was an inch from his face. She smirked with defeat."Words I have also heard too much of." Hermione began to back up and she drew her wand. "Do you not realize when and if you do find her, she will despise you. With the memories I have conjured in place you are the monster in her eyes."Draco eyes became filled with rage and his chest felt heavy. He did not know the exact contents of what Astoria's "new" memories consisted of but by what Hermione was describing they were not light-hearted. Draco suddenly felt a few of his heart strings pop at the thought of Astoria despising him."Will you help me or not?" Draco said pathetically.Hermione pondered for a mere moment and she stood in front of Draco with a cold expression. She took her hand and cupped his face."I will. First you will do something for me."Draco peered into her eyes and rose his upper lip. He looked her up and cocked his head slightly."You will spend one full day and night with me."Draco broke the connection and began to laugh."That's what you want? My company" Draco sped his way back over to Hermione and backed her into a corner. He eliminated the space between them and was inches from her face. "What is it you want, Granger? Do you miss this?" Draco raised his hand to lightly trace her jawline. "Do you miss my touch that much?" He whispered to her.Hermione met his eyes deeply. "I think you miss mine more."The tension between them was thick and it was only going to take one move before one of them connected lips. Draco threw himself off Hermione and backed up enough space. His mind was feeling more clouded than ever, but in another sense, everything was feeling good."Fine. Tomorrow I am yours." Draco said without meeting her eyes.Hermione fixed her trench coat and peered into Draco's eyes."See you tomorrow then."Hermione flicked her wand and she apparated away. Draco kicked a nearby trash can and felt his chest heave. Theo came rushing to the ally way."Mate, what happen? Did she agree?"Draco began to laugh like a maniac and every laugh was hidden by hurt. He longed for Astoria's touch, her smell, and her voice. Draco knew how much he loved Astoria, but what was breaking surface were his hidden feelings for Hermione as well. When Draco drifted out of Hermione's life it was because Astoria crept in. It was not all Astoria's fault for she was unaware she had such an effect on Draco. The young wizard nodded and began to drown out his mind with firewhisky like many times before..."Do you ever imagine us out of this place? Somewhere quiet and where we can hear the birds chirp." Astoria said as she plopped down next to the large oak tree.Draco was eating a green apple, admiring how she spoke with such optimism."I never really imagined my life anywhere except here, but for you, I will live on a boring, bird-chirping house." Draco seized Astoria's hand and plopped her onto his lap. He looked her into her eyes and saw nothing but beauty. Her smile radiating the room and her laugh filled it with bliss."I believe when someone uproots their life for another they are in love." She said with a smile."Apologies sweetheart, did I make you believe I loved you?" Draco said sarcastically.Astoria pushed him to the ground and straddled him."I know you love me, and I you. It'll always be you, Draco." Astoria said before she connected their lips."And It'll always be you, Astoria." Draco whispered as he ran through her hair with his fingers.
  
    Chapter Text
    November 1997             It was the next morning and Draco was waiting for Hermione's arrival. He did not know which emotion he was feeling more. Anxious upon spending the day with someone who once shared his heart, or guilt for betraying Astoria. The thought of Draco doing this all for Astoria put his mind at ease, but not completely. The Dark Mark was beginning to tingle sporadically the last few days, but Draco paid no mind. Draco knew that he would not have the comfort of this apartment for much longer. Lord Voldemort was gaining power and growing stronger as the days came and left. Astoria's emerald necklace was kept close in Draco's trousers pockets and anytime he needed a sense of being near her he gave it a squeeze."One day, I want to paint the most beautiful painting and hang it in my entry hall for all the world to see." Astoria boldly while massaging her thumb with Draco's.Draco enjoyed listening to Astoria talk, Merlin knows she does it often. The sound of her voice soothed his mind and gave him optimistic thoughts about a future, a real future for them."You would fill my house with all your own paintings?" Draco asked cautiously.Astoria turned around to meet his gray eyes and a large smile crept across her face. "Your house?"Draco smiled and kissed her forehead. "Our house?""Well, the lady of the house does manage the decorations. How would you feel about a large, gaudy painting of my own in the entry hall? It would have my signature at the bottom for all guests to see." Astoria then proceeded to sway her wand to reveal her signature in the air."I am sure it will be lovely." Draco said lowly.Draco shook his head and continued to dress himself until Theo came into the room."Mate, I think she is outside."Draco peered over the terrace to see Hermione down below dressed in her trench coat, stockings, and tan ankle boots. He felt Theo touch his shoulder."Are you sure about this? What of Astoria? I thought you- ""I am doing this for her. This is what the mudblood's terms consisted of. I am no bloody choice. It seems I never do." Draco spat.Draco went into the apartment, snatched up a bottle of fire whiskey and took a fierce slug."Do not lose your head, mate. Astoria needs you." Theo said pleadingly."I know what I am doing. Do you think I am going to throw away everything I have with Astoria for a mudblood who is stuck on me? Forget it- "Theo seized the bottle and tossed it aside."You are still sweet on this girl. I can see it. Which is why I am tellin' you do not lose yourself." Theo said while shoving his friend lightly.Draco scoffed and shoved him back. "Tell the bloody bastard outside my door to leave the apartment alone for the day. Tell him I am busy."Draco proceeded to walk back out onto the terrace and peered down once more at Hermione who was patiently waiting. The way he figured he had two options. The first to go with Hermione, do as she say for the next day and endure his presence. The second option being forgetting this entire plan and coming up with a new one to find Astoria. Half of Draco's mind was leading him toward the second, but he knew there was no other plan that he could see that did not involve Polyjuice potion. He whipped out his wand and apparated to the street's alleyway away from prying eyes.Hermione began to trot over to where he was, and Draco would be lying to himself if he did not say she looked attractive in the morning light."Well, you got me here. Where will you drag me first?" Draco spat.Hermione rolled her eyes and flicked her wand over Draco's head. He inquired what she was doing, and she proceeded to explain that she placed an identity spell over him for the next twenty-four hours. The spell was not the strongest one, but it could hold its own for a day."One more matter that needs tending.""And what would that be, Granger?" Draco said in a bored tone."My name is Hermione. You are to call me by my name for the next day." She demanded.Draco smirked and eliminated the space between them."Fine, Hermione."Hermione nodded and in an instant she grabbed his arm and apparated them to another place. The journey must have been far because Draco felt his head begin to whirlwind. When a wizard apparates at a greater distance than necessary they can develop dizziness or even get whiplash."Care to explain to me where we are?" Draco spat.Hermione looked at him and smirked. "Bern, Switzerland."Draco began to examine his surroundings carefully. He knew Granger was not stupid enough to take him to a highly populated wizard country where he would be easily spotted as the murderer who killed Dumbledore. Granger was a clever girl who whisked him away to a mainly muggle country with very little wizard folk."Fancy some tea?" Hermione asked lowly before setting off for the nearby village.Draco followed behind her and took note to how the wind was breezing through her waves, and how her hands swayed with every step. Draco always took note to how Hermione walked. When she was nervous, she would sometimes trip over her steps, but when she was determined she walked with integrity and a heavy step. Causing the ground to quake with every footing. Today she was walking with elegance. Something about her was different. Granger was not the schoolgirl he once knew two years ago, but from under his nose she turned into a fierce woman.Draco and Hermione sat in a local tea shop that was surrounded by wildflowers, and local market people. There was an elder woman across the way selling her herbs and flowers, trying her best to explain the significance of lavender scent to anyone who would listen.Hermione plopped two spoons of sugar into her tea and stirred gently. It was apparent she was avoiding eye-contact with Draco. However, he did not mind much. If Granger was not going to talk then it was going to be a quiet day. Draco began to pour honey into his tea before Hermione took note and snickered."For someone who is bitter you do enjoy sweet additives."Draco scoffed and furrowed his top lip."I do enjoy the sweeter things in life." Draco spat back while taking a sip."Which is why you enjoy French --- cuisine so much?" Hermione said while sipping her tea slowly.Draco knew she was referring to Astoria. Astoria was half-French on her mother's side and Draco did enjoy her, in every way. But he was not going to spend the next day listening to spiteful jabs about Astoria from a jealous woman."If I didn't know any better Granger, I'd say there is jealousy lining your words." Draco said while burning through her gaze.Hermione leaned in and rose one eyebrow. "My name is Hermione. You never had much trouble calling me that when I was on top of you."Draco rolled his eyes and snorted. "You are really trying to make me remember those days, two years ago. Granger those were- "Hermione slammed her cup down. "HERMIONE!" She yelled."Bloody fine! Hermione! Merlin, when did you become so edgy!" Draco asked while throwing his hands up in defeat."Since you decided to leave me for Voldemort's bitch." Hermione spat back.Draco slammed his fist to the table causing Hermione to jump in her chair, but she kept her gaze steady. Neither of the two were backing down and that only made more tension between them.Draco knew that in this moment it was going to be a long twenty-four hours. He needed to keep his eye on the prize. The prize being that Hermione brews the Polyjuice potion and he is finally reunited with Astoria. Keep his wits together for the next day and all will be well.Draco put his hand to the tea kettle and noticed it had gone cold. He waved his hand slightly and steam rose from the kettle."Are you mad? You cannot use magic here! This is a muggle city. There are laws in Switzerland regarding magic. When we are here magic within the city is forbidden." Hermione whispered.Draco cocked his head and scoffed. "I cannot warm a kettle? Bug off."Hermione kicked his ankle causing him to yelp."What's that for!""For being an ass. You are to listen to me, now stop being a pompous ass." Hermione spat.Draco rolled his eyes and sat back in his chair. Every moment that passed by felt like hours. To say Hermione was good company was exaggeration. Draco would rather be gauging his eyes with needles rather than sitting in utter silence with the woman who despises Astoria to her core.As the day progressed Hermione and Draco walked through the village, admiring the wildflowers, gazing at the mountain views, and listening to the townsmen stories of magical beings who lived beyond the lands. This made Draco and Hermione laugh quietly to themselves afterwards.Draco hardly believed it, but the sun was finally setting, and the day was nearly over. Soon he would be back in Paris with Theo and have a viable plan for Italy."There is an inn at the end of town. We'll stay there for the night." Hermione said lowly while clasping her trench coat."Are you asking me to get a room with you Gr-Hermione?" Draco said in a low tone.Hermione did not answer but instead she began to walk faster to avoid the question. Draco was not excited about this, he figured she would at the very least supply separate sleeping quarters since he was technically involved with someone else.Hermione secured the key for the room and they made their way up the stairs. The room was large with a king-sized bed, a blush-colored comforter, ablaze fireplace, and a terrace overlooking the Swiss mountains."Charming." Draco spat while taking a seat next to the fire."It will do." Hermione said while tossing her coat onto the bed.Hermione had not taken her coat off the entire day and Draco noticed she was wearing a black colored dress that was laced. She looked beautiful with the low lighting accentuating her face."Erm – care for a drink?" Hermione asked while taking out a bottle of fire whiskey from her satchel.The satchel she was carrying must have been enchanted. Every time she reached into it, she pulled out something that should not fit inside a tight purse.Draco accepted the glass of fire whiskey and clinked his glass with hers. He noticed she took a considerable sip, as did he. When she finished, she investigated his gaze and he looked at hers. She had gorgeous brown eyes, the same as Astoria. Her hair was glowing with the light of the fire. It was taking every strength in Draco's mind not to run his hands through her waves. Draco broke the gaze and took a seat in front of the fire again. Hermione followed and sat across from him.Draco was beginning to feel more uncomfortable with every silent minute that passed. He would take sips from his glass, peer towards Hermione and she would be staring at the fire in deep thought. Draco figured if he were to spend the night with this woman, a spot of conversation would not hurt."What festers your mind?" Draco asked while placing his leg over his knee.Hermione shifted in her position. "I-I was just wondering about the architecture of the fireplace. Its exquisite." She said hesitantly.Draco scoffed and nodded in agreement. The fireplace was a fair size with artist carvings lining the side and had a wooden mantle with a clock at the top. However, Draco knew Hermione well enough to know when she was lying. When she would lie, she would often stutter and refuse to make eye-contact.Draco caught note of her shifting her position yet again and she was on her second glass of whiskey."Do I make you nervous?" Draco inquired."Poppy-cock. I have known you since I am eleven, and I have punched you square in the face, you do not make me nervous." She spat.Draco rose from his chair and poured himself more whiskey and stood in front of her."Well, if you want to hear my opinion- ""Whether I want to or not is entirely out of my control- ""Do you ever shut up long enough for someone to finish a sentence?" Draco interjected while pinching his temple.Hermione scoffed and gestured her hand with her glass for him to continue."You bit off more than you could chew." Draco said lowly then he placed his glass on the mantle and proceeded to place both his hands on Hermione's armchair, boxing her in. "I think, you proceeded to believe you could handle a night with me, but you are getting cold feet. What's a matter, Hermione? Are you afraid once you open the door to my mind you will stray to far and not find your way out?" He whispered to her.Hermione only knew a half of what Astoria knew, regarding Draco's past with his father's temper, how much his mother meant to him and how his father would smack him around. Draco knew that once Hermione traveled into his mind, she would fall to deep to climb back out."I thought I knew who you were, Draco Malfoy. The misunderstood boy in Hogwarts. The boy who was the bully but behind his mask was someone who felt deep emotion. But now- "Draco inched closer to her face and he noticed her breath becoming unsteady to the point it was staggered. Her face looked more lovely the closer he inched. It took every might not to grab her and make love to her next to the fire. Something inside Draco was coming back to life, the desire to touch, the desire to fuck someone who cared for him."B-but now you are nothing more..." She inched closer. "Then a murderer." She said breathlessly and sat back in her chair.It felt like a bullet punctured his chest. Murderer. The very title for who Draco was now and he knew for a fact, his killing days had along begun with Albus Dumbledore, but he would never admit that to anyone."Perhaps I am beyond saving, Granger. It would do you good to steer clear of me from now on." Draco rose and stretched his arms over the mantle. "Pack up and leave. I no longer want you involved in my problems. I thought I could involve you, but I have too much already." Draco proceeded to grab his suit jacket and reached for the doorknob, but Hermione seized his arm and lifted his sleeve to his forearm."This does not define you." Hermione said as she was talking about the Dark Mark, but Draco kept his eyes on the doorknob. Hermione let go of his arm and took a step back. "You summoned me, and I came. I told you if you ever required my aid I would come, and I have. All I want- "Draco took her by the shoulders and pushed her to the wall. "What is it you want Granger?" He spat in her face with his face filled with rage. "Here I am standing before you, a marked man, and a murderer. Yet you still want something."Hermione's face began to fall, and tears began to roll from her face. She lunged from his grasp and cupped his face. "I told Astoria I would care for you if she died. I am here keeping that promise, Draco." Hermione admitted while keeping her hands on Draco's broken face.Draco released himself from her grasp and paced to the other side of the room. He picked up one of the whiskey glasses and smashed it against the table. Draco nearly cut his hand in more than five places with the glass, but he could hardly feel the pain only the blood trickling on his fingers."Astoria is not dead!" Draco roared.Hermione began to hasten across the room until Draco backed up so she could not meet his stance."Draco. Please listen to me- ""ENOUGH!" Draco interjected."If you would please- ""Shut the fuck up, Hermione! Do not presume to talk about things you do not know!"Hermione's tears rolled down her cheeks until they were dripping off her jawline. Draco was unsure what the exact emotion he was feeling. The knot in his gut said there was a spot of truth in what Hermione was saying, but his heart was screaming at him telling him it was lie.Hermione ran to her bag and pulled out a letter. The writing was horrid and scrambled, difficult to translate but Hermione handed it Draco. He snagged it from her, it was an official Order of the Phoenix letter. The letter was addressed to Kingsley from Moody.                                  Kingsley,                         There is fair reason to believe Thomas Greengrass' eldest daughter, Astoria, is heir to the Dark Lord. The Eyes say she is accompanied with Bellatrix LeStrange. Reasons unknown. The Eyes say that the girl has been seen dueling with Black and she is becoming more powerful by the day. We fear she is the girl the Prophecy speaks of. The Order is suggesting a 'removal' of the girl straight away.                                   M. MoodyDraco read the letter to himself several times before crumpling it. The Order of the Phoenix was going to attempt to assassinate Astoria. They knew who she was, where she is and what Voldemort had planned for her. Draco felt his world coming down upon him, because the other woman who was supposedly was still in love with him kept this vital piece of information from him."When was this letter sent out?" Draco inquired.Hermione seemingly boggled by his question spit out a date. "Erm – approximately a week ago. This is merely a copy. I was going to send it to you when- ""When you knew the Order killed her." Draco whispered.Hermione stayed silent and stiff in her position. Draco had half a mind to apparate to Italy right now and begin his search alone, but he was at a loss. Italy was a highly populated wizard country and if he were not careful, he would be recognized instantly."Draco – I am sorry. I- "Hermione began to say as she tried to touch his face, but he moved backward."Keep your hands off me. It is time for you to leave my fucking sight." Draco said as he began to reach for the doorknob once more until Hermione crept behind him and touched his arm."Believe me when I tell you I had nothing to do with this decision. Draco, perhaps if what we know of her is true, it will be better for everyone if-""If what? If she gets fucking murdered by your fucking friends?" Draco spat and he turned around to face her intently. "I shall never call for you again. I am ashamed I did. It would do you good to smash that mirror because I will never heed your summons anymore."Hermione began to cry out and held onto his hand. "Draco listen to me. I am still offering my aid if you want it. I am not sure when the orders will be carried out, but we can stop it before it happens." Hermione pleaded."Why should you want to help her or me? Go back to your fucking Order of the Phoenix and tell Potter I give him a jolly greeting."Just before Draco was going to exit the room and owl came swooping into the room with a letter attached to its mouth. Hermione and Draco looked at each other and Draco seized the letter from the owl's beak. He gave it a soft caress and it flew away instantly.                                        Astoria has been killed. News from the low-level council has been silent, but the high council has been in seclusion.                                           NottDraco began to laugh maniacally until the tears filled his eyes. He held the letter in his fist until it crumped. Draco felt numb. Like the very thing that was holding his heart in place had been snatched away and he was falling deeper into himself. Astoria was no longer alive. Nothing mattered anymore. Draco threw the letter into the roaring fire and snatched the whiskey bottle from the mantle, downing the bottle."You got your wish, Granger." Draco said sarcastically.
  
    Chapter Text
    1980 – One month before Astoria's birth."I am sorry Miss, but the baby will not be born alive at this rate. We do not understand why but with every passing day she grows weaker. We cannot stop it nor slow it. I will allow you to make the proper arrangements with your husband. I really do sympathize with you both." The muggle doctor packed up his medical bag and scurried out of the Greengrass estate.Eloise laid upon the bed sobbing quietly to herself and Thomas began to pace around their room."Darling, I cannot bare to lose this child. We have lost so many, and she is nearly to term- I – I cannot bare this I cannot- "Eloise began to hyperventilate before Thomas took her into a tight embrace."Shhh-my love. I promise you I will fix this." Thomas stroked his wife's head gently, but she cried uncontrollably into his chest.Thomas and Eloise longed for a child ever since they were married. In Eloise's family it was difficult for the women to conceive, almost impossible. Eloise had suffered three miscarriages before becoming pregnant with her current baby girl. When she found out she was carrying a girl the nursey was instantly painted light purple, and the walls were lined with tiny roses. Thomas infused the walls of the nursey to have a never-ending scent of lavender, to induce peaceful sleep for his child.Eloise was almost thirty-five weeks pregnant, and for the past month she has been on strict bed rest. The baby was becoming more inactive with every week, and during the second trimester is when the fetus should be kicking its mother quite frequently, but this baby was not. One day when Eloise was gardening in the front of the estate she was struck with a throbbing pain in her abdominal area, and when she stood up, she looked down at her legs to see them dripping with blood. Ever since then she has been confined to her bed. The Greengrass' have had every muggle obstetrician examine Eloise and each of them keep repeating the same, the fetus is becoming weaker every day. In the 1980s there was no such practice of magical pregnancies yet, so the Greengrass' were objected to listen to the muggle practitioners' commands."I believe I might of some assistance Thomas." A dark figure said standing in the doorway of the bedroom.Thomas jumped up and Eloise furrowed her brows. "Who are you?" Eloise inquired."I am the savior of your unborn child." The dark figure said as he began to walk into the room slowly."You- I know you. You are the wizard Wormtail informed me about. I listened to the tale, but I did not believe him. Can you actually help us?" Thomas said looking pathetic.The dark wizard stood next to Eloise and grasped her hand, ignoring Thomas. "My dear, I make you a promise. This child will be beautiful of face and the most powerful witch that walks this Earth. And you will have the honor of being her mother."Eloise began to cry harder, and she gripped the wizard's hand and kissed it. Her eyes red from pain, and breath sporadic. Eloise was a skeleton of a woman with every nutrient being drained from her and into her unborn child."My baby girl wil-will live? I will be able to hold her and hug her and-and kiss her?" Eloise said hopefully as tears spilled from her eyes.The dark wizard nodded lightly and then shot his eyes toward Thomas. "I promise all of that, but there is one small contingency.""Anything. Name it and it is yours. Whatever it takes to save our child." Thomas spat in a hasten tone.The dark wizard strode across the room and turned sharply. "When the girl reaches her maturity, I will claim her. I will rise her to power and grant her with only the finest in life."Eloise and Thomas looked at themselves. Thomas looked appalled but Eloise was quick to respond."Anything. Save her." Eloise spat.The dark wizard smirked and began to walk over to Eloise before Thomas stood in front of his wife."Absolutely not, Eloise, we cannot promise our child to another man before she is brought into this world! It is madness!" Thomas said pleadingly.The dark wizard, looking bored, remained silent and began to walk out of the room until Eloise screamed out."NO! Save her. Do not listen to my husband. Save my damned child, I beg you. I cannot bare to deliver a cold baby. I only ask that when you claim her, allow her to see her family, always. That is all I ask. I am bringing her into this world, and I want to remain in her life until it is over." Eloise stated plainly.Thomas, still looking appalled, grasped his wife's hand and remained silent. The dark wizard strode over and cupped Eloise's face, and glared into her eyes."I would never dream of separating this child from the people she loves. I give you my word, she will always have family near." The dark wizard said suspiciously.The few moments passed, and Eloise laid on her back. The dark wizard stood over her, wand in hand, and began to wave it over her abdomen. A hood of black fog began to engross Eloise's stomach, and tiny wisps were escaping the fog. The incantation was complete, and Eloise had a smile on her face."We shall meet again in roughly sixteen years my friends." The dark wizard said, and Eloise reached for his hand."Thank you – ""Lord Voldemort, madam."Eloise nodded and grinned. "My Lord."The dark wizard apparated out of the room, and Thomas glared at Eloise in disbelief. "Do you realize what you have just done?""I saved my child, Thomas." Eloise spat as she rose out of her bed."You condemned her to a life of servitude to a dark lord!" Thomas yelled while pointing at the spot where Voldemort apparated from."Perhaps, but she will have family to protect her. We will raise her like a normal witch. She is not to know who she is until the proper time. I saved our fucking daughter, Thomas. I have done more for her before she took a breath in this world, than you will do in her entire life." Eloise spat as she strode out of the room.Meanwhile, at the Riddle house, Voldemort apparated into his living room where he was greeted by a lovely, fierce looking woman."Did you meet with my relatives, my Lord?" The woman inquired."I did, my dear. The baby was as you suspected, she inherits the blood curse of malediction. I witnessed it as I touched the baby's soul. This child will be everything we need and more." Voldemort paced around the room and stood over the fireplace.The woman stood next to him and touched his arm. "She is the one my Lord?"Voldemort remained silent for a moment, glaring into the fire, but then looked into the woman's eyes. Her eyes were yellow, but her skin tinted dark."Indeed, Nagini. I am sorry I am not strong enough to break the curse myself- ""No-no my Lord, only descents with the same blood curse have the power to change it. Eventually, the curse will force me to take permanent form as a snake, but when this child is powerful enough, she will reverse it. I am sure of this." Nagini stated boldly. "I am bound to you until death, my Lord, as will this child. We are at your uttermost service. A piece of you lives within me, my Lord, and that child is a apart of my bloodline. We will never fail you."Voldemort took Nagini's hand and squeezed it tightly. "You were always my favorite, and most faithful servant." Voldemort glared at Nagini and then he yelled loudly for his faithful servant, Wormtail."Y-yes my Lord? What is it you require?" Wormtail said in a frantic tone.Voldemort, ignoring Wormtail, touched Nagini chin and muttered, "It is time."Nagini nodded and transformed into her snake form. She slithered along the floor and under the feet of the men, causing Wormtail to squirm. Voldemort strode over to his nearby bookshelf and pulled out a black diary, and at the bottom was transcribed his dead name, Thomas Marvolo Riddle. Voldemort began to flip through the pages of the enchanted diary, until he came to blank page. He flicked an enchanted quill in the air and spoke as the quill wrote. Wormtail proceeded to calmly conjure a slit on Nagini, causing her bleed. Wormtail cupped the blood she was spilling and handed it to his master. Voldemort glared into the cup, inhaled deeply, and took a small taste."I cannot bare to be separated from you. If anything were to happen to us, we shall be preserved within the pages of this diary." Voldemort held the cup of Nagini's blood over the diary and muttered incantations. The blood began to drip itself onto the pages, and the diary soaked up the liquid. A flash of white light came from the diary and was engorged around Nagini, and in a few moments was gone.Nagini transformed herself back into her human form and wrapped her arms around Voldemort. "Is the memory completed my Lord?" She inquired.Voldemort nodded his head and squeezed her hand that rested on his shoulder. "When the girl reaches her maturity, she will also be bonded to this diary once the spell is complete. We cannot have her escaping while she takes the burden of your curse. Until such time, I keep the replica of this diary in your procession. I am going to hide this inside your mind, my dear. Only I will have the power to access it."Nagini nodded and bowed slightly. "Anything to aid my master."Voldemort held the replica diary in his hand and muttered an incantation to hide the replica inside Nagini's mind. The diary dissolved into smoke and poured itself into Nagini's head. "What will be the child's name my Lord?"Voldemort glared into Nagini's eyes and smiled. "Astoria."1997Voldemort was sitting calmly in Malfoy Manor while having his blood cursed, permanently formed, snake by his side, Nagini. The curse had taken its toll on Nagini and in 1990 the malediction caused her to transform permanently into a snake. Voldemort and Nagini waited patiently until Astoria was powerful enough to break the curse, but Voldemort was getting a strange feeling something was wrong with Astoria. That the bond was becoming weaker, and he was hardly able to connect himself with her anymore."I want Astoria brought to me immediately." Voldemort spat.The Death Eaters disassembled in the drawing room and apparated out of the manor. Nagini was waiting patiently at his feet. Voldemort spoke to her in parseltongue. "Enough is enough. It is time for her to train properly. There is war coming Nagini, and I need to keep both of you safe."A lonely hour had passed before Antonin Dolohov appeared before Lord Voldemort. "My Lord we are unable to find the girl. It appears she is off Hogwarts grounds."Voldemort's face turned full of rage, he flicked his wand and began to choke Dolohov with his own black robes. Voldemort spoke coldly and sharply, "You will bring her here to me, immediately!" Dolohov continued to choke for another few moments before being released and collapsing into the ground. With another short crack he apparated away.Nagini was slithering around the room when Severus Snape apparated into the drawing room with a nearly knocked out Astoria in his arms. "My Lord she was being tortured by snatchers. I presume they had not had any idea of her title, but she has a substantial wound on her neck."Severus laid Astoria onto the dining room table, with her eyes slightly open and her talking deliriously. Voldemort flicked his wand and flipped her over to expose the bloody runic imprint on the back of her neck. The rune that was originally carved by Voldemort to mark what was rightfully his. Before Voldemort could fathom words, another man came bursting into the room looking frantic, he was accompanied by his wife."What have you done to her! You monster! Our beautiful girl is with you only less than two years and here she is nearly dead!" Thomas whaled while pointing to his limp daughter on the table.Eloise clutched onto her daughters' hand and stroked her face, but she remained silent. Voldemort flicked his wand and forced Thomas to be silent, then he glared into Eloise's tearful eyes. Eloise being the French, poised woman she is, never spoke out of term, and never raised her voice in the presence of Lord Voldemort."I will search Astoria's memories and uncover what actually happened to her." He said coldly.Voldemort pointed his wand at Astoria's head, and muttered legilimens. Voldemort broke through her berries and witnessed many happy memories, and many modified memories."Happy Christmas, Malfoy." Astoria said while raising her glass."Happy Christmas, Greengrass." Draco said lowly.Voldemort was taken aback by the many memories she had with Draco Malfoy and decided to plunge deeper to examine her emotions."You are the only light I have left in me." Draco murmured."After she left." Astoria spat while breaking his grasp.Draco grabbed Astoria's arm and picked her up, shoving her against the wall, smashing their lips together."When will you fucking realize I love you and not her?" Draco said while smashing his lips upon hers.Voldemort, appalled at the memory of Lucius Malfoy's son, his loyal follower, was disobeying orders of staying away from his property. Voldemort left the part of her mind where Draco inhabited and plunged into her most recent memories. The memories were almost crystal clear, and he plunged further."No, NO please do not! You will pay for what you are doing!" Astoria roared out while being held down by snatchers. She could feel the needle wand work on the back of her neck. They wanted her blood and recognized the rune carving. Astoria's blood ran with dark magic, and any dark being who ingests it will be filled with power for short amounts of time. The snatchers continued to carve around her neck bones, and puncturing veins to drain as much of her blood as they could. Then with another short crack, Severus appeared and stunned the snatchers. He whisked Astoria away and brought her to Malfoy Manor.Voldemort left Astoria's mind and she took a large exhale, as if she were being held underwater. She began to squirm on the table as the more conscience she became. Eloise clutched her daughter's hand."It appears Severus was telling the truth. Sadly, our dear Astoria did not get a good look at her attackers, but eventually they will be dealt with. From now on she will be under my constant supervision. After she has recovered from the attack, I will have her sent away, until she is needed. I will leave her in the capable hands of my most trusted follower, a woman of great strength and she will teach Astoria all she needs." Voldemort stated while pacing around the room. Then his eyes shot to Thomas and Eloise. "I order both of you to flee England. Take to the Highlands of Scotland. You will have a day to clear out your house and make necessary arrangements."Thomas' mouth nearly hit the floor and he began to stride over to the Dark Lord, but Severus held him back. "You cannot banish us! This is my daughter!"Voldemort strode over and ran his fingernail across Thomas' face. "You gave up that right the moment she was born, Thomas."Thomas and Eloise were escorted off the property and would be banished to the Highlands of Scotland, until they were summoned to return. Nagini slithered herself onto the table near Astoria and examined her closely. Nagini spoke to Voldemort in his mind, "She needs blood of her own, my Lord. Allow me."Voldemort took a blade from nearby and cut Nagini slightly, just enough for her to bleed. He drained her blood into a cup and poured the blood back into the wound on the back of Astoria's neck. Voldemort noticed that the runic imprint had changed carvings, but he decided not to re-carve it, because it may just kill Astoria with the amount of pressure it puts on the body. With every drop of blood that was entering Astoria the color was returning to her face, her fingers began to twitch, and her eyes sprung open wide. She sat up and Severus aided her to stand."My dear ... girl. How please I am to see you standing here before me." Voldemort stated lowly.Astoria held her head and shook it. Her eyes fluttered around her to make sense of where she was. She glared up at Severus who gave her a cold look, then at her master who was standing before her. Astoria's face shifted from looking confused to numb."My Lord." She then turned to Severus. "I thank you, Professor, for saving my life. Without you I'd probably be dead." Astoria said plainly. Her eyes constantly shifting around the room as if she were trying to make sense of her memories.Voldemort strode over to her and gripped her hand. "My dear, who did this to you?"Astoria looked down and tried to remember. "I... I... ran out of the castle in great distress. I took out my wand and apparated to Hogsmeade. I needed some time to think. I was wandering into the woods when I was thrown to the ground, then the snatchers did... what they did to me. Next thing I knew I awoke here."Severus peering down at her looked at her intently and spoke slowly. "What exactly caused you to flee the castle so suddenly, Miss Greengrass?"Astoria began to walk over to the window; tears began to roll down her cheek. She gripped onto her snake emerald necklace and attempted to speak but she choked. Then with another deep breath she spoke. "It was Draco. I saw him ... saw him with a mudblood. He was erm --- doing things with her that he should not have been. I caught them in the restricted section of the library. After that I just remember running out of the castle.""Young love stings... you would know all about that wouldn't you Severus?" Voldemort said coldly. Severus did not answer."Severus, find Bellatrix, and bring her to us." Voldemort said plainly and Severus without hesitation, apparated away.Astoria clutched her necklace and continued to wipe her tears of betrayal away. Draco was no longer in love with her, and he proved it. The new memories Astoria currently had had shifted her thoughts about what she wanted, who she loved and what her new agenda would be.Severus reappeared with Bellatrix and she was quick to embrace Astoria."My dear you are a precious thing!" Bellatrix smelled Astoria hair and gasped. "My lord! She smells just like her!" Bellatrix gushed.Astoria found herself smiling uncomfortably and taking a few paces backward. "Bellatrix this is important, if you please." Voldemort said while swinging his wand to pull out a chair for both women."Now, Astoria needs protection after tonight's events, and since I can no longer entrust your nephew to keep an eye on her without getting too ... familiar... I am going to leave her in your capable hands, Bellatrix." Voldemort said plainly while Bellatrix gushed at his words.Astoria stayed silent and knew there was no way out of this. Bellatrix had never tried to harm her, so perhaps this would be a new adventure for her. Plus, she would be glad once she is finally ridden of being in this Manor. Everything around her reminds her of Draco, and every time she closes her eyes, she sees his hands on Hermione's body. She knew it was time to put Draco Malfoy in the past."Where erm—my Lord, will you be sending us?" Bellatrix inquired."Portofino. You three will be staying in a safe house, put together by the council. I am trusting you that you will teach Astoria all she will need to know for the war that awaits us in the future. You are a great fighter Bellatrix, pass your knowledge down to Astoria."Bellatrix turning red and blushing like a schoolgirl leaped at the opportunity to please her master. Astoria's heart almost leapt at the thought of going to Italy. She found herself imaging that she would be painting on a terrace overlooking the Italian waters."When do we leave?" Astoria inquired."After Albus Dumbledore is eliminated." Voldemort said coldly.A memory flashed before Astoria's eyes, the day in the Room of Requirement with Draco. She remembered that he was the one ordered to assassinate Dumbledore. Astoria almost allowed herself to feel guilty for leaving Draco, but the memory of his betrayal took over."I—I am sorry my Lord, but the three of us?" Bellatrix inquired while cocking her head, and as she did that Nagini slithered onto the dining room table. Voldemort began to stroke her head and smiled."Nagini will be accompanying you." Voldemort said lowly.Astoria managed to lose everyone she loved in a matter of hours. She lost the love of her life to a mudblood whose soul purpose was to win over Draco's heart, and she succeeded. Astoria lost her parents to banishment. She could still feel her mother grasp on her hand and hear the strain in her father's voice as he demanded Astoria's freedom. With all the hurt she felt in her heart, the only face that was still clearly intact was Draco's. His grey stormy eyes, his Slytherin ring that laid on his middle finger, and the smell of his suit. Astoria felt disgusted that she was still thinking of him, but she knew he was no longer thinking of her.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997Malfoy Manor was cold, unwelcoming and was surrounded by dark artifacts. Lucius Malfoy was an avid collector but has been forced by the Ministry of Magic to sell his more, unlawful artifacts. Astoria took note of a particular statue that stood in the corner of the formal dining room. The statue took the form of different people, one day it was a beautiful woman, the next a famous wizard. Astoria found the statue interesting and sometimes she felt it staring at her."Astoria? Astoria are you with us?" Severus inquired.Astoria snapped out of her daze and became apart of the High Council discussion once more. Today the council was discussing when the assassination of Dumbledore was going to commence. Every time they discussed Dumbledore her thoughts shot to Draco. She imagined him performing his task and seeing the look of horror on his face. Astoria feared that Draco would be too light-hearted to perform what he was chosen to do."Apologies. I drifted for a bit, erm – I have a matter that should not be overlooked. Draco's safety, for one. Once he performs his task the Ministry will be on the search for him. Here, will be the first place they search." Astoria said while sounding worried.She feared that the council was not thinking about the aftereffects for Draco Malfoy once he killed Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore is named the most powerful, wise, and important wizard in the world. The Ministry of Magic was not going to let Draco run free all over Britain after committing murder."If I may, my Lord, perhaps after the task is complete, Draco should join Astoria in Italy? Italy is under the protection of the Italian Minister and in Italy the children will be safe." Narcissa stated hesitantly while glaring at Astoria.Astoria felt her stomach hit the floor. The last person she wanted to see was Draco, but at the same time, he was the first person she wanted to embrace her. Part of Astoria hoped the council would agree with Narcissa and Draco would be ordered to go into hiding with Astoria. The other part of her wanted to curse anyone who suggested putting Draco in the same room as her. Lord Voldemort's face turned cold, and his eyes shot to Astoria."My dear, how does this plan sound to you?" Voldemort inquired while petting Nagini's head.The Dark Lord was leaving the decision up to Astoria. She desperately wanted to jump at the offer and have Draco shack up with her until they were called back to Britain, but her head speaks louder than her heart. Astoria's heart was still in pieces, and Draco tore every ounce of emotion from her the day he betrayed her."If it please you, my Lord, I suggest Draco go into hiding in France. Paris perhaps? I know for a fact that Paris is inhabited by mainly muggles, and there should be no issues with the French Ministry. My family owns an apartment, and it is perfect to accompany one person." Astoria said lowly.Voldemort pondering his thoughts and stroking the snake, came to a unanimous decision. After the task was finished Draco would be whisked away to Paris until it was safe for him to return to Britain. Astoria felt a weight lift off her chest and she could breathe a little easier, but she noticed Narcissa's face fall at Voldemort's decision. Astoria felt bad that she declined the idea of having Draco accompany her to Italy, but it was too soon. The wounds in her heart still bled."I also require one more thing, my Lord. My best friend, Lilla Dubois is to be my companion in Italy." Astoria stated and Antonin Dolohov, Lilla's betrothed, stood up abruptly. "Absolutely not! She is to be my wife and I say she remains where she is!" Dolohov stated coldly.Astoria shot him a look of disgust and began to speak slower. "Lilla needs to be with me right now. It will benefit her, and you, if she trains with me. A woman never knows when she will need to defend herself. I implore you, Master, I would not ask if it was not important to me." Astoria implored.Voldemort pondered for awhile and said, "I will allow it. Dolohov, the Dubois' girl is not to be your wife for another year. Surely, you can spare her for a few months."Dolohov scoffed and developed an annoying attitude. "I want her returned to me by January. I shall collect her myself tomorrow at Hogwarts school. Severus can I trouble you to allow me access to the Slytherin common room fireplace? I will travel by floo powder." Dolohov said annoyingly.Astoria scoffed at the idea, but at least by tomorrow she would have her best friend by her side. It would also be the time the truth was revealed to Lilla. Astoria tried her best to hide who she was to protect Lilla, but there was not much she could do since her engagement to Dolohov. Astoria figured the best way for her to protect Lilla would be to keep her nearby. Astoria desperately needed someone who loved her unconditionally, and would always choose her, that person was Lilla Dubois.The council meeting concluded, and Astoria was going to be spending two days in Malfoy Manor before her international departure to Portofino. One of the tiny house elves directed her to one of the lavish guest rooms, it was equipped with a king-sized bed with a floral comforter, a bookshelf, and a bathroom the size of a small kitchen. In the middle of the bathroom stood a black, claw foot bathtub. Astoria waved her wand and instantly filled the tub with hot water. She stripped herself and comfortably sat. She laid her head back, and waved her hands to light the candles nearby, along with the fireplace. As she swayed her hands around the water in the tub and glared up at the ceiling, she tried to imagine what her life was now going to look like. What was the new normal going to be?In two days, she was going to travel to Italy with Bellatrix LeStrange, and Lilla to go into hiding. Why Astoria was going into hiding was beyond her knowledge but, what was now troubling her mind was the thought of war. It was no secret that Voldemort was anticipating a war starting within the next year or two, but what worried Astoria the most was if she was on the failing side. A pit inside her gut was beginning to form at the thought of being arrested as a war criminal and being exiled to Azkaban for fighting for the "dark side." Would the Ministry take pity on a girl who was forced servitude before she even took her first breath on Earth?Then another thought, the one that was at the front of her brain, what she was going to do about Draco if she ever saw him again, and she knew eventually she would. The pain inside her heart told one story, but her head told another. It was almost as if her head and her heart were speaking two different languages. Astoria had a semi-clear picture of what she saw between Hermione and Draco the day she was tortured by Snatchers. However, she could not shake the feeling that someone tampered with her mind. Astoria was trained in the magic of occlumency and legilimens, she knows what it feels like to have memories tampered with. The more she thought about it the more her memories made sense. She knew somehow, in some way, that Hermione was still in love with Draco, but when Astoria tried to picture the memory it slips away. Astoria lifted herself from the tub and peered into the nearby mirror. For some reason, the woman who was staring back at her looked foreign. She had the same hair, lips, eyebrows, but her eyes held another identity. Astoria rolled her eyes and slipped on a black night-gown along with a long silk robe.Astoria found herself wandering down the halls exploring the Manor. Generations of Malfoy portraits hung on the walls, and each one of them eyed her in confusion as she walked past them."She looks so young!" One portrait of an elderly woman said."Isn't that one a pretty thing!" Another portrait of an elder man said.Astoria ignored their comments and continued to stroll. She came across a room at the end of the hall, and it was ajar. She poked her head inside to find a bedroom that belonged to a man that shattered her heart. Naturally, she strode right in. She peered over to his nightstand table to find textbooks on Alchemy, and parchment lying about with notes scribbled. Astoria opened the drawer to find something that surprised her, it was a photograph, of her at the masquerade ball. She was standing alone by the staircase staring intently at something, that she could not remember what. On the back of the photo there was writing on it, "I thought you might like this." At the bottom of the photo, it was signed from Theo Nott. Astoria wondered why Draco would keep a photograph of her in his nightstand, but she dismissed it.Astoria continued her snooping with the dresser. The dresser had pictures of Draco with the Slytherin quidditch team, Draco and Theo, and one at the end without a frame. The picture was of Lilla, Theo, Draco and Astoria in the Slytherin common room. Draco had his arm around Astoria, and she had her hand his knee. Astoria felt her eyes beginning to pool and she held the photo in her hands and had the thought of ripping it until something told her not too. A gut feeling of not wanting to destroy the memories.Astoria was almost going to leave the room, until she caught note of an open chest to the side of the dresser. She figured since she has already snooped so much, a little more would not hurt. The opened the chest and her heart sank. This is the chest full of memories she wanted to destroy. Inside the chest she found letters, notes, and even a photograph of the one girl she wanted to hex into oblivion. Hermione Granger was invading Draco's room with her mere memory. Aggressively, Astoria was on her knee's ravaging through the letters, as she read some of them, they made the pit in her stomach swell.                                 Dear Draco,                             I miss you. Please, I hate it when we fight. I am sorry for being so blunt. I know you would never betray my trust. The past is behind us, please talk to me. You are the only one I can have a judgement-free conversation with anymore. Meet me in the Room of Requirement after Transfiguration.                                                    HAstoria rolled her eyes at the thought of having to beg a man to give her attention. Hermione was so sappy compared to Astoria. If Astoria wanted Draco to talk to her all she had to do was smack sense into him, and demand he listen. Draco was strong-willed and stubborn but would often cower when Astoria took charge. She found another letter and read it.                                  Draco,                                    I am gifting you the time-turner in the hopes you will use it well. Read up on what happens to wizards who medal with time, it may surprise you. Do be careful. McGonagall granted me the turner two years ago, and I fear I have abused its power. If you ever mess up, simply spin it backwards and fix your mistake. You cannot be seen.                               With Love,                                 HermioneAstoria spit on the "with love" part of the letter, crumpled it and put it back into the chest. As she was sorting through it more, she found a tiny box, and opened it, inside was a tiny hourglass necklace, it must be the time-turner. Astoria pondered for a moment if she should snag the turner. After not much consideration, she decided to snag the turner and call it a parting gift from Draco and Hermione.Morning came and Astoria was anxiously awaiting Lilla's arrival. Astoria was still exhausted from days prior and decided to stay in bed to rest longer. She was re-awoken to the sound of her bedroom door opening. When she focused in, Lilla walked in with her Hogwarts chest, and her eyes red. Astoria shot up and immediately embraced her best friend."Why am I here? Why-why are YOU here? No one will explain to me what the fuck is going on!" Lilla said while grasping Astoria.Astoria held onto Lilla's shoulders and took a deep breath. Astoria explained to Lilla who she was, what that meant for her future, and where they were going for the next few months. Lilla was silent for a few minutes and began to pace around the room. Lilla sat on the windowsill and lit a cigarette. Astoria's eyes lit up; she has not had a cigarette in a long while. Lilla handed her one, and then finally spoke."Are you okay?" Lilla inquired while taking a puff."I have had time to come to terms. I mean I am not thrilled, but I am who I am." Astoria said while flicking her cigarette into an ashtray she conjured up."Well-what the hell, Tori? You have known this for almost two years, and you kept it a secret from me? I thought you trusted me." Lilla said as her face fell. Astoria strode over and hugged her tightly."I wanted to tell you; I just did not want to involve you. Draco and Theo were already in the council so- ""Theo knew before me?" Lilla interjected.Astoria's face became red with shame. She had no valid explanation as to why she trusted Theo, a friend she knew for a year, over someone who was like family to her."I'm sorry." Astoria bowed her head and began to twiddle her necklace."How is Malfoy Junior? Is he here too?" Lilla said while taking another drag from her cigarette.Astoria scoffed and exhaled the smoke. "Yeah... erm – that is another matter I need to discuss with you."Lilla rolled her eyes and leaned forward. "What did the prick do this time?"Astoria chuckled, but then her eyes began to pool. Lilla grabbed her hand and gave her a warm smile. In order to tell the story Astoria was going to have to relive the pain again, but she was glad to have the comfort of her best friend.
  
    Chapter Text
    1997"Who are you!" Astoria yelled out while still pointing her wand at the woman."The woman cocked her head to the side and released a low laugh. The woman touched the tip of Astoria's wand and physically lowered it."Me? Why, I am you." The woman said bluntly.Astoria's eyes snapped open, and she was gasping for breath. Beads of sweat were dripping from her forehead as she was scanning her room. The dream she had felt real, too real, it almost felt like a memory, but Astoria could not put her finger on where it came from. Before she could form another thought her bedroom door burst open."Good, you are awake. Downstairs, now." Bellatrix spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and swung her legs over her bedside. She and Lilla have been "hidden" away in Portofino for a few weeks, and it seems the daily routine it is becoming stale. Every morning Bellatrix LeStrange wakes up Astoria and makes her practice dueling with Lilla until her arms feel numb. Bellatrix has been given strict instructions by the Dark Lord that Astoria can handle a proper dueling match, learn to become quick on her feet and develop a sense of strength with casting dark curses. It is not secret that war was approaching, and a battle was underway, Astoria was just unsure of the timeline. She feared that she would be locked away in Italy for years waiting to hear that she can return to Britain.Although some days, when Bellatrix ordered Astoria to get some much-needed rest she found herself sitting by the water and imagining she was in the Highlands of Scotland back at Hogwarts. Sometimes she longed for singing on the large oak tree that overlooked the Black Lake. She was thankful that the Dark Lord allowed Lilla to join her during this time, but she felt guilty for taking Lilla away from her life at Hogwarts. Even if Lilla kept reassuring her that she would stand by Astoria no matter what.On some days, after training concluded Astoria sat on the terrace and the snake, Nagini, would slither by her and stay with her. Astoria discovered a strange comfort by talking to a reptile that could not talk back. She often wondered why her Master ordered Nagini to stay with her during her time in Italy, but she learned early on it is not wise to question her master's actions. When Astoria would discuss how she was feeling, what she was thinking to Nagini she had a strange feeling the snake was listening to her. Like she could understand what Astoria was prevailing to her, but she quickly discarded that thought and came to realize that snakes cannot understand English, only pareseltongue."Dueling is a form of dancing. With every move you make it needs to be fluent. Your wand is an extension of your arm, dearie." Bellatrix said while extending Astoria's arm more. "Come on now move with me. You there, shoot some curses." Bellatrix said while pointing at Lilla who was standing on the opposite side of the room.Astoria felt her body being guided by Bellatrix's hands and with every curse Lilla shot at her, she began to move more fluently and swiftly."Marvelous! Your Master would be so pleased with how well you are doing." Bellatrix stated while putting her hands through Astoria hair in a strange way.Astoria was not thrilled with the fact that Bellatrix was teaching her dueling or that she was her guardian her awhile, but oddly enough, Bellatrix offered viable information. Information that may come in handy during battle.Astoria sat next to the water of Portofino and tried to think about what her dream meant from the prior night. The woman's face in the dream was blurred, but her voice seemed familiar. She had a strange feeling that she lived through the dream, like it was a tampered memory. Astoria went to fiddle with her snake emerald necklace but when she went to touch it, it was no longer around her neck. She remembered what had happened to it."Put this in a small box and make sure Draco gets it. I no longer want it, it holds my most precious memory of him, and I cannot bare to be tempted to re-live it." Astoria said as she handed her best friend the necklace."Are you sure? You love this necklace. I hardly see you ever take it off. "Lilla said."I do not want it. Let him have it."Astoria re-focused her eyes to see Lilla coming to sit with her. She plopped down and handed Astoria the rest of her lit cigarette. Astoria took a long inhale and exhaled slowly."You need to stop thinking about him, Tor."Astoria laughed and snorted. "I am not. I was merely- "Lilla took back the cigarette and looked at Astoria in the eyes. "Bullshit. Whenever you are thinking about that prick you come down here to sulk. Astoria you need to keep your shit together. The Dark Lord will be furious if- "Astoria stood and scoffed. "Oh- so what! Yes, I am heartbroken. Yes, I think about the man I used to love. And yes, maybe I am giving myself a pity party, but you know what? I deserve it. Every single man in my life either owns me, betrays me, or rips me to the core! So why can I not have a moment of weakness!"Lilla lowered her head nodded. "You are allowed a moment of weakness, but your weakness is consuming you." Lilla hesitated for a moment but pulled out a Daily Prophet article from her satchel and handed it to Astoria. "Care to explain why you have Malfoy's arrest article torn out and placed in your drawer?"Astoria snatched it and looked at the picture of Draco for a mere moment. It was a picture of him from sixth year, not smiling, but looking cold. Astoria knew what his smile looked like, and how she wished she could see it again. She snapped out of her short daze and became agitated. "Why the hell are you going through my drawers!""Because I worry about your entitled ass. I hear you in the night y'know? I hear you screaming, crying, and panting. I mean, do not get me wrong, the situation you are in is not ideal, but something else is troubling you. I can see it in your face." Lilla said calmly.Astoria hesitated to tell Lilla about the dreams she has been having with the strange woman dressed in black. She did not want to worry her friend more than she already was. Lilla was correct in thinking that Astoria was thinking about Draco more than she should but is that not normal for a heartbreak?"No, I am fine. I have embraced my destiny now. If Draco wants to fuck that mudblood, then he is welcome too. Plus, I am sure that muggle-born will not go near him anymore after what he has done. One day she is going to pay." Astoria said boldly."Make the bitch suffer." Lilla said with a smirk.Bellatrix walked into the room with a letter clutched in hand, and a concerning look took over her face. Astoria and Lilla were sitting at the kitchen counter sipping tea."Girls. We have a matter that needs requires discussion." Both girls began to shift their position to face LeStrange. "I have received a letter from Dolohov explaining what the council discusses. The High Council is under speculation that the Order of Phoenix is searching for you, Astoria."Astoria shifted once more and grabbed Lilla's hand. Then Bellatrix came over and put her hands on Astoria's shoulders, and she tried to shift away from her touch. "Do not worry your pretty head, darling. The Dark Lord put you under my protection and if you are here, you are safe. The bloody Resistance will fail, as they always do. My younger sister should know better than anyone what failure feels like." Bellatrix walked to the other side of the room and Astoria began to shorten her breaths."What do we do, Mrs. LeStrange?" Lilla inquired as she stood."This does not concern you, girl. Get out. Get to your room, immediately." Bellatrix spat.Lilla was about to counterstrike, but Astoria tugged on her arm. Lilla huffed and darted outside."Do not worry, Astoria. The Dark Lord has plans for you. I feel it is time that your memory become engraved for good." Bellatrix strode over to Nagini and placed her wand over the snake's head. Astoria felt it was strange that Bellatrix was muttering an incantation over a snake's head, but when it came to Bella, she did not ask many questions. There was a puff of white smoke and in Bellatrix's hand laid a small black journal.Bellatrix grabbed Astoria's hand, whipped out her pocket blade and sliced the inside of her hand. Bellatrix began to mutter curses from under her breath and forced Astoria's blood to drip along the blank pages of the journal."What the hell is going on- "A large white flash casted and Astoria felt a sense of heaviness take over her mind for a few moments. The blood that was pooling from her hand was soaking up the pages of the journal. Astoria caught the name that was written on the journal, Tom Marvolo Riddle. She blinked her eyes and tried to remember where she heard that name before. As Bellatrix muttered more charms over the diary the memory of the name struck her mind.Tom Riddle was the name of the tall, dark, handsome man from the Dubois' masquerade party. She had never seen him since that night, and she almost forgotten about their dance. Then a large knot began to form in her chest and the realization struck her. Tom Riddle was Lord Voldemort.The memory engraving spell on the journal was complete but Astoria was at a loss for words. Everything was happening too fast. She held her bloody, sliced hand with her other hand and spoke."Pleas-please tel-tell me. Wha-what just hap-hap-happened?" Astoria croaked out."Memory engravement in the Dark Lord's journal. This journal holds a piece of his soul and his memory. His memory, when activated, can be brought to the world by the magic of the diary. And now your memory and Nagini's have been engraved with your own blood. If anything happens to you child, you will be brought back."Astoria remembers reading about the dark magic of hiding a piece of one's soul within objects. However, for the spell to be successful there needs to be a human sacrifice."If this erm- diary is the Master's ... horcrux then how will I be brought back if I die? Correct me if I am mistaken, but, a part of my soul does not reside in this diary. I have not killed anyone to finish the spell?"Bellatrix strode over with a smirk on her face and her wand twirling in her hand."Oh, dearie that is easily fixed. The spell will be completed by tonight." Bellatrix said swiftly and with a short crack apparated out of the house.Astoria was confused and began to pace around the house until she heard Lilla rejoin the room."What did the bitch say?"Astoria explained to her what Bellatrix did with her hand, the diary, Tom Riddle and how the spell was to be completed by nightfall. If the spell was to be completed, then Astoria was going to have to kill an innocent person. She has never taken a life before and has never felt the feeling of a killing curse's dark magic course through her veins."I cannot do this. I cannot take a life. I-I" Astoria began to hold her chest and hyperventilate. With every breath she was taking the black spots on her eyes became larger, and the world became smaller."Breathe. In for 1 2 3 4 5 out 5 4 3 2 1." Lilla kept repeating as she held onto Astoria tight."Breath in for 1 2 3 4 5 and exhale for 5 4 3 2 1. Good job, Tor."It has been a long time since Astoria experienced a panic attack, and she was glad Lilla was there to comfort her.Astoria sat on the steps of the house in Portofino and breathed in the Italian air. She enjoyed watching the tree's dance with the wind, and how the birds sang. The smoke from her cigarette filled the air, and she felt the slither of the snake, Nagini, sit by her. Astoria scoffed."Come to keep me company?"Nagini remained in her position and looked up at Astoria with her horrifyingly yellow eyes. Astoria felt a strange comfort when she would speak to the snake.She chuckled lowly. "I do not suppose you could offer me some words of wisdom?" Puff. "But erm—perhaps if you would listen to me ramble for a while, I would feel at ease." The snake laid motionless but continued to stare. Puff. Astoria blew out the smoke of tobacco. "Everything is a mess because of me. I should never have been born. I was doomed before I even took my first breaths. One moment I am a scorned woman who wants nothing but to string up the mudblood by her wrists and watch her decay, and another I feel lost. Like the day I first arrived at the Beauxbaton Academy, and I looked up at the great big white castle and saw a home." Astoria laid her head against the railing of the stairs and sighed. "I am ashamed to say I still think of the bastard. I assume he is prancing around Paris, enjoying the home I secured for him, but he would never know that. Y'know I even saved his sorry ass life? The Master was going to imprint him with Ancient Runes, but I begged for him to receive the Dark Mark instead, but d'you think he knew that? No. I fear apart of me will always love him, but I need to store it in the furthest parts of my mind. Until I find someone else to love me."Nightfall came quicker than usual, and Astoria felt herself drifting off until she heard the front door burst open. Bellatrix came strolling in, wand raised, and a man levitated above her."Stand up, dearie."Lilla came walking into the room and instantly stood in front of Astoria. Bellatrix smirked and raised her hand to push levitate Lilla as well, leaving her powerless."Let me down! Release me!" Lilla demanded. Bellatrix silenced her with a charm."Please, please. Do not harm, Lilla. She- ""Hmm how strong I thought you were, but in reality, you are fucking weak." Bellatrix raised the tip of her wand under Astoria's chin, and Astoria furrowed her brows. "The Dark Lord commands that your memory be preserved, and who am I to disobey orders?"Bellatrix awoke the levitating man and dropped him to the floor. She stood behind Astoria and whispered into her ear. "Those traitors will kill you, my dear. If you do not do this then you're already dead." Bellatrix raised Astoria's wand arm and pointed it at the man that was on his knees before her. The man looked about middle-aged, a muggle and a family man. His hair disheveled and eyes red with tension. "Come on darling, live forever, and then you can live with the man who you truly love."Astoria spun around and her eyes burned through Bellatrix's. "Your nephew is a bastard who should rot in hell for what he has done to me. I will not take an innocent life, even if that means The Order hunts me down, and kills me." Astoria said as she threw her wand across the room.Bellatrix began to stroll around the room and faintly touching the surroundings. Nagini was laying stiff on the other side of the room watching the scene."Well, well, hmm – we are in a bit of a predicament. Let me give you a tad of incentive." Bellatrix flicked her wand and pulled out a tiny mirror. The mirror floated over to Astoria and she clutched it tight as the clouds within the glass became foggy, and slowly started to fade. That is when she saw Draco in the apartment in Paris, the floors filled with bottles of whiskey, and his face in distraught. Astoria's eyes began to pool and her grip on the mirror tight. She had half a mind to throw the mirror to the ground and watch the scattered pieces roll along the floor."If you do not do as your Master bids, then I will be forced to take action on my own nephew. Now we do not want that, do we?" Bellatrix said lowly with her head cocked.Astoria summoned her wand and pointed it at the helpless man that kneeled before her, pleading for his life. Astoria glared up at Lilla who was giving her a look of worry but then turned her head."DO IT!" Bellatrix shouted.Astoria looked into the man's eyes, held her wand tight, and took in a deep inhale. "Avada Kedrava." The killing curse escaped her lips, the green flash flew and hit the man, causing him to go instantly cold. Astoria felt her soul latching onto the diary's pages, and the power of the dark curse course through her veins. The Rune on the back of her neck began to burn, and one single tear left her eye."Well done, darling. The Master will be so pleased. How do you feel?" Bellatrix inquired as she clutched the diary to her chest.Astoria rose her head, smirked, and glared at the dead man. "I... I feel... different."Bellatrix smiled and released Lilla from her levitation charm. When Lilla slammed onto the floor, Bellatrix gripped onto the corpse and apparated out of the house. Lilla embraced Astoria."Oh ... Tori. We need to get you a magic cleanse. You must feel horrid. They say when you cast an unforgivable if you do not cleanse your magic then you will be tainted. Come on- "Lilla tugged on Astoria's arm, but she resisted."I do not wish to be cleansed. I am perfectly well. I feel a twinge better. My heart... it feels as if it has stopped bleeding from betrayal. Perhaps the Dark Lord was right when I embrace my true nature I will feel less." Astoria said boldly as she crossed her arms. Lilla's face turned confused, and she cupped Astoria's face."That is not you recovering from heart break. It is the dark magic."Astoria strolled over to the window and peered out onto the luscious green grass. "I am fine."

    1997Grimmauld PlaceAlastor "Mad Eye" Moody was walking around the dining room table with a map on the table and Remus Lupin was standing on the opposite side of the table."We cannot let this young, power-struck girl to fight in the upcoming war. I fear if she lives until that point, she will be too powerful, I daresay more powerful than him." Remus said hesitantly.Mad Eye began to nod his head and grunt as he tossed the note across the table. "The girl has been sent to Italy with Bellatrix LeStrange and some other French girl. That snake also went with them. Do you not find that strange that Voldemort sent his pet snake to hide away with his pupil?"Remus took the note and read it repeatedly. "And this was sent to us from whom exactly?"Mad Eye's eye began to swirl around until it focused on Remus. "The Eye inside the Malfoy house."Remus nodded and began to burn the note so it would not end up in distrustful hands. "Why can you not go down to Portofino, execute the girl and come back before you are spotted."Mad Eye grunted and shook his head. "I cannot do it alone. It is almost impossible to find the girl alone. She is almost always with someone. The Dark Lord make sure his slaves are properly protected.""Did the Eye mention the exact reason for why the girl was sent to Portofino?" Remus inquired.Mad Eye shook his head and poured himself and Remus a whiskey. Handing Remus, the glass he spoke softly. "Whatever the reason, it is not good. You do realize who this girl is, don'tcha?"Remus shook his head and took a sip of whiskey. Mad Eye laughed lowly. "Her name is Astoria Greengrass. She is Thomas' and Eloise's first-born."Remus' eyes bulged from his head and his expression became stern. "The Dark Lord's pupil is Thomas' daughter?" Mad Eye nodded slowly, and it looked as if Remus was going to either faint or smash his hands to the wall."Bloody Merlin. I knew Thomas Greengrass from when we were in school. He always ran with the wrong crowd, but he was a friend! Now I am assisting in the execution of his daughter! No. Absolutely not." Remus began to run for the door when Mad Eye stopped him."Are you going to choose to save one murderess' life over the lives of thousands of people? Remus, this war is coming, and it is approaching fast. Potter can only travel so far to find the rest of the Horcrux's. If there is anything the Order can do to weaken Voldemort it must been done. Starting with the Greengrass girl. Even if that means I have to cast the curse myself."Remus remained silent and poured himself another whiskey and downed it instantly. Mad Eye conjured up some parchment and paper. He wrote out a letter and laid a wax seal upon the envelope."Granger! Will you come in here?"Hermione had been summoned to Grimmauld Place to attend to certain matters of the Order but was often used as a person to do mindless bidding for the higher council members. Ron and Harry were off traveling the globe for the Dark Lord's horcrux's but after a few weeks of research Hermione felt out of place, and just as she was a letter from Mad Eye flew in and she returned to Britain relieved."Yes, Moody?" She asked annoyed.Mad Eye handed her the letter that was intended for Kinglsey and instructed her to send it by owl straight away, she agreed and scurried off."Remus, there is another factor that needs to be thought about before this plan is set in stone.""What might that be?""Astoria is with the Malfoy boy. Draco murdered Dumbledore which proves he is not afraid of killing people that get into his way. This is going to be a tricky situation." Mad Eye said while scratching his head."The Eye stated specifically that Draco has been sent to Paris. I assume their union is broken so we should have no issues eliminating Astoria from the equation further."Hermione kept her nose close to the door from the outside and listened to every word. She peered down at the sealed letter and ran into the kitchen to read it, she made a copy of the letter and shoved it into her satchel. Just as she was about to attach the note to the owl to be sent to Kingsley, she felt the urge to scurry back up to her room.Hermione felt drawn to look into the mirror piece that Draco gave her, and it resided in her closet, tucked away, hidden from prying eyes. When she took out the mirror piece and looked at it, she saw his eyes looking back at hers. She heard the words muttering her mind by the power of the mirror, "I need you." Hermione's heart skipped a beat. Draco was calling for her, he needed her, and she wanted him, desperately. However, she knew what the Order was plotting against Astoria. Hermione had enough sense to realize if Draco was summoning her it had everything to do with Astoria and nothing about her. She had half a mind to ignore the summons but then the other half leapt at the idea of seeing his face once more.Hermione trotted back down to where the owls were and attached a note to its leg and sent her response. Hermione decided she was not going to discuss what the Order was plotting about Astoria to Draco, yet. She wanted to know what he wanted and, if he deserved the truth, she would inform him graciously.Portofino, ItalyAstoria pulled a bottle of whiskey from the cupboard and poured a few shots into her morning tea. Lilla looked at her with judgement."What? I am on a diet." Astoria said bluntly while sloshing down the tea.Lilla rolled her eyes and continued to flip through the Italian newspaper. After a few moments of silence Astoria flicked her wand and instantly prepared her appearance for an outing."Going somewhere?" Lilla inquired without looking up.Astoria laughed lowly and set her elbows on the counter. "Going into town for a new hat. Would you like to join this time? Perhaps you will meet a new man and quit pining over that ruddy schoolboy- ""Shut the fuck up about Theo." Lilla interjected.Bellatrix had received a letter from the council stating that they had welcomed a new member, Theo Nott. Nott had been awarded the Dark Mark and was sent into hiding with Draco in Paris. This was causing Lilla to worry for Theo more than she already was, in secret. Except, Astoria knows Lilla better than anyone else, and she knows when something is on her mind. Astoria pried the truth out of her and came to find out that Lilla was in love with Theo. Astoria was not thrilled that Lilla had fallen for a Hogwarts schoolboy and hoped she would learn from her best friends' mistakes."Oh-please. I am sure Theo is in Paris alongside Draco fucking as much French ass as their dicks will allow." Astoria said unamusingly.Lilla's eyes shot up with rage, she flicked her hand a knife went straight for Astoria's head. Lilla missed her skull by an inch. Astoria picked up her wand and muttered an unforgiveable curse, "Crucio." Lilla fell to the floor clutching her abdomen in pain, but still she managed to speak. "Tori stop it! Aghh!"The dark magic began to course through Astoria the longer she held the curse with no remorse. After a few more seconds Astoria ceased the curse and kneeled over Lilla. "It would be best if you learn to give up on love. All it does is poison you."Lilla peered up at her with hurtful eyes. "You are not my friend. You are the woman who has taken over her recently."Astoria smirked and laughed lowly. "Oh, Lilliana. I am finally becoming the woman whom I was meant to be."Clapping was heard from across the room followed by a small chuckle. "As you are, my dear." Bellatrix said proudly."I am going marketing in town. I require a new hat. I shall return before nightfall. Ciao." Astoria whipped out her wand and apparated out of the house swiftly and landed in the alleyway in the market center of Portofino.As she was strolling through the shops browsing for whatever her heart desired, she felt a presence following her. With every step she took she saw a shadow copying her. Astoria strode into a tiny café and went to the back of the establishment in hopes the shadow would follow. She slid up against a wall, wand drawn and her footsteps approaching. With her heart racing the shadowed person approached her and she pointed her wand at him."Wormtail?" Astoria inquired.Peter Pettigrew, otherwise known as, Wormtail had been the one following her around the marketplace. Wormtail jumped at the foot of her wand at his face."My lady, apologies. I did not mean to f-f-frighten you. I was instructed you keep a close-eye on you while you venture out alone."Astoria rolled her eyes and tucked her wand back into her waist band. "I do not require a babysitter." She said as she began to stroll out the café doors. Wormtail trailing behind her began to walk with her."M-my lady please, let us return to the safe house. Your Master will not approve of you wandering around town unaccompanied.""Well turns out I am not unaccompanied, you are here." She said as she was trying on a tan beach hat.Wormtail was becoming more and more agitated and nervous as Astoria strolled on along the stores. It was beginning to irritate Astoria to the point she was almost at her boiling point."My lady, please- ""Wormtail, I swear to Merlin if you do not shut up, I will hex you back into the Highlands. Why don't you head back to the house? I will not be long I just want to buy this bracelet and then I will apparate back."Wormtail was hesitant to leave Astoria unaccompanied, but after much convincing (and some threatening) Wormtail apparated back to the house. Astoria huffed in relief and continued to stroll along the marketplace. She noticed the sun would be setting soon and she would have to apparate back home, but not just yet. One more store to explore, the Italian bookstore."Ciao! Buonasera signorina, come posso essere utile?" Said the bookstore clerk.Astoria muttered a translation charm under her breath and when the bookstore clerk began to speak she could hear what he was saying, in English, in her head. One of the most useful spells she has learned during her time in Portofino.Astoria explained to the clerk that she was just browsing and did not require his assistance. She ran her fingers along the shelves of old Italian literature, and found herself in the romance section."Do you enjoy Italian romance?" A man said from behind her causing Astoria to jolt.She turned around abruptly to face the man who was speaking to her. The man had brown dishelved hair, scars across his face and his voice was low and stern."I do. I enjoy reading from time to time."The man crossed her arms and furrowed his brows. "I hear an English accent with hints of French. What an interesting combination. I take it you are not from Portofino originally?"Astoria shook her head. "No, I studied in France for a while but then transferred to a school in Scotland. My family is originally from Leeds."The man nodded and ran his fingers through his hair. "Ahh- I see. Well, would you tell me your name?"Astoria felt slightly uncomfortable by this middle-aged man asking her questions, but she figured sharing her first name would be no harm to a, probably, muggle."Astoria." She held out her hand. "And.. you are?"The man took her hand and shook it kindly. "Remus." Astoria nodded and proceeded to collect her books and exit the store but Remus followed her outside."Would you like me to walk you home? Portofino can be a tad rough in the night."Astoria was not planning on walking home, since she was going to apparate but she could not share the knowledge of her magic with a muggle. So, in order to heed any questioning she accepted his offer, but as the walk lead on Remus continued asking her more personal questions. Leaving Astoria feeling a sense of uneasiness."Have you a man, Astoria?"Astoria slightly appalled by the question did not want to seem as rude as him she answered him honestly. "I did. However, he left me for another woman. A horrid woman. Which is why I fled to Italy. He is in Paris living with his own mistakes."Remus nodded and the sun was fully set at this point. Astoria was about to trail off and apparate straight away. She was worried Wormtail or Bellatrix might find her strolling around the town with a strange muggle."Well.. it has been nice chatting with you. I must leave you now.""Now just a moment, Astoria." Remus grabbed her by the arm.Astoria began to try and lunge her arm free. She went to draw her wand but Remus blew some powder into her face and she was instantly knocked out.--- "I will not be the one to do it, Mad Eye. I am no murderer." Remus said bluntly.Astoria felt her limbs numb, and her head propped up against a brick wall. She peered up at the sky and noticed it was late at night and the cool breeze flew across her face."This girl is the girl from the prophecy, Remus. Dumbledore warned us of her before he was murdered by the Malfoy boy. She needs to be put down before she can rise to power and kill us all." Mad Eye said sternly while pointing at Astoria.Astoria was coherent, but was unable to move or speak. She assumed they had an immobilize charm cursed upon her. If she were able to draw her wand she would kill both these men instantly."I will not. I refuse. I have a wife to think about now." Remus said as his back faced Mad Eye."Alright, fine, then I will be the one to put her out."Mad Eye Moody came trudging over to her and gazed into her eyes. Astoria wanted to spit into his face and call him a blood traitor for killing a pureblood witch, but with her lips locked she stayed silent.Mad Eye drew his wand and she closed her eyes and prepared for death. For a mere moment a face came to her mind. Draco's pale, pathetic, bastard of a handsome face. She accepted the fact that she was never going to be able to see him again or slap his pretty boy face again. If she were given the chance to see him again she would punch him in the nose and fuck his brains out. But this was the moment that Draco and Astoria were going to end, because death is an inevitable separation."Avada Kedavra!" Mad Eye shouted. Green flashes filled the air and instantly hit Astoria in the chest. Her eyes closed shut, her body limp and instantly cold.

    1998Draco entered the formal dining room to have a seat next to the Dark Lord. A meeting amongst the high council has been called to discuss further details in the takeover of Lord Voldemort."I trust our numbers have risen to better our cause?" Voldemort inquired while stroking the Elder Wand.Draco nodded. "Yes, my Lord. Nott and I have personally been inquiring about these matters. The overthrow will be quite easy. The uprising numbers in magical creatures is outstanding and by the summer we shall be ready to strike."Voldemort remained silent for a few moments until his gaze met Theo's. "Excellent. Then by June the Wizarding World will be under my command."Theo nodded and clasped his hands on the table. "Indeed, my Lord. Do you require anything more from Malfoy or I in preparation?"Lord Voldemort stood abruptly and began to sway around the room until he peered at the men. "Yes, I do require one more task. Tomorrow morning travel to Dolohov's estate and fetch me a package. It is of the utmost importance."Draco and Theo nodded in acceptance and the meeting concluded. Draco apparated from the Manor and appeared in front of a tiny Scottish Inn on the outskirts of Glasgow. Draco apparated into his room and began to strip himself of his Death Eater army attire. He poured himself a whiskey and splashed his face with water. He began to read a book on Alchemy when he heard an almost silent crack from behind him."How was the meeting?" Hermione inquired while taking off her sunglasses and head wrap.Draco took a slug of his whiskey and scoffed. "I just wasted half my day discussing plans I have no interest in. I am still the Dark Lord's fucking errand boy."Hermione walked over to Draco and whisked the glass from his grasp leaving him to scoff at her once more. "Am I barred from indulging in whiskey now?" He spat.Hermione rolled her eyes and poured herself a glass while refilling his. Draco chuckled and took the glass, and they clinked. She sat on the opposite chair from him."How are you coping lately?" Hermione inquired hesitantly.Draco snorted and crossed his leg over his knee. "You mean, 'how am I handling the death of the woman I loved most in this world'? Bloody fantastic, Granger."Hermione stood up and knelt before Draco with sorrow filled eyes. "I am sorry. By the time I learned of the Order's plans it was too late. It is my fault she is dead." She started to place her hand on his and he swiped it away causing Hermione to sigh.Draco tilted her head up with his hand. "I am not going to rehash what was already discussed. Those bloody bastards will pay for what they've done."Hermione set her glass down on the table and sat on Draco's lap while wrapping her arms around his neck. "I am still unsure how they found out about her location in Italy. I heard Remus and Moody discussing an Eye within the Dark Lord's council."Draco swallowed the rest of his whiskey and grasped onto Hermione's hips. "I haven't a clue. Whomever it was, they will pay. I will line up Mad Eye Moody, Lupin, and the backstabbing bastard in the council up against a wall and exterminate them. They took away what I cared about most in this world." Draco growled.Hermione cocked her heard and leaned in closer to Draco's face. "Surely not the only thing you care about I hope?" Hermione whispered.Draco hesitated, his lips almost connecting with hers but something within him made him stop. He lowered his head and exhaled. "Granger, I know what you expect out of me, and I cannot provide."Hermione nodded and huffed. Then she smirked and grinded against him. "You know... Astoria told me to take care of you right? If she was ever not able to anymore." Her legs stiffened against him and she felt him excite beneath her. "Why not let me take care of you?" Hermione buried her face in Draco's neck and began to leave a trail of kisses. Draco's hands began to stiffen around her waist and slowly began to guide her hips against his.Hermione raised her head to connect their lips, but Draco bobbed his head back in avoidance. Then just as he moved his head away, he saw her face staring at him in his mind. Draco got up abruptly and snatched the whiskey bottle off the fireplace mantle and swung it back."Merlin, Draco. It has been months since her passing. I have been the one caring for you since then. Listening to your drunken sorrows, comforting you during your horrid night terrors. What is it I have to do to prove my allegiance to you?" Hermione pleaded.Draco was hurting, in more ways than one. When he would attend the Dark Lord's meetings his mastered skill in Occlumency came in handy when pushing past the depression of losing Astoria. This had been the second time Draco had lost Astoria but this time it was not distance that separated them but something more permanent, death.When Draco heard the news in Switzerland regarding Astoria, he almost went into a fitful rage. He wanted to go after the Order members who murdered his beloved, but Hermione talked him down. After which he proceeded to smash a few glasses against the wall and nearly drank himself into alcohol poisoning.Hermione made it her business to check-up on Draco every so often and inquire about his mental and physical health. Over the past few weeks Hermione and Draco would meet in Scotland at the Inn and talk for hours about their troubles. Draco had more troubles than Hermione, but she was pleased to listen. However, Draco feared that these visits and talks were leading Hermione in a different direction. Draco's mind was still tied with Astoria's even if she no longer walked the Earth. Plus, Hermione was a prime member of the Order of the Phoenix, the people who murdered his love, how could he ever love a woman who belonged to the other side of the fight?"Granger, stop. Is this... what we have not enough for you?" Draco spat.Hermione got up and cupped his face. "You are hurting, and I am offering you something that will take the pain away."Draco lunged from her touch and scoffed. "You think by fucking you it will make me forget about Astoria? Are you mental?" Draco walked to the other side of the room, whiskey bottle in hand.Hermione reached for her wand and drew it. "Do you not remember how it once was? Allow me to remind you. Legilimens!" Hermione roared.Draco's body slid up to the wall and he held onto his head while memories flashed before his eyes. However, he was not making attempts to force her out of his mind, just yet."Allow me to take these wretched robes off you." Draco said while sliding off Hermione's Gryffindor robes to the floor.Hermione bit her lip and began to untie Draco's tie. Hermione connected their lips and Draco picked her up to place her on a nearby couch in the Room of Requirement. Draco slid off Hermione's top and began to kiss along her shoulder line as she released low gasps of breath. Hermione slid her hand through his hair and lightly tugged at his scalp.Draco tiled Hermione's head up and whispered at her. "What do you want, Granger?"Hermione put her arms around Draco's neck and connected their lips. "You. I want you."Draco unclasped Hermione's skirt and tossed it aside. She heard Draco's belt unbuckle and watched his trousers drop to his feet. She instantly felt the pulsations between her legs grow more intense. Malfoy picked her back up and had her sit on his lip and he slid into her. A moan escaped Hermione's lips and Draco yanked a fistful of her curls.Draco fought against the memory Granger was forcing him to see, he knew why she was showing him one of their, many, sexual encounters. However, it was time for her to see something different. Draco forced her out of his mind, drew his wand and muttered the spell, "Protego!"Hermione was not skilled at occlumency, so her mind walls were not as strong as Draco's. Draco needed Granger to understand his bond, love, and dedication to Astoria, even if it meant crushing her heart. Draco shoved his way into her mind and planted the memory. The memory of Draco and Astoria flashed before Hermione's eyes, and she fought as hard as she could to resist watching but she was weak."I would have moved heaven and Earth for that girl at once time. I would have whisked her away and lived in solace for the rest of my days- "Draco paused.Astoria felt her eyes beginning to pool."Astoria, you are the inconvenience I was not expecting." Draco paused and scoffed. "Granger has my past. Astoria you have my future." He whispered at her.Draco finally released himself from Hermione's mind and she fell back into the chair from exhaustion. She began to breathe heavy, hold her chest while Draco stood in silence regarding her."Do you understand now, Granger?"Hermione lowered her head and could not bare to make eye-contact with Draco. "Yes, Malfoy. I understand. I do have your past. I have everything she does not and will never have. The innocent years of your life. Before you turned into the man you are today."Draco's face filled with rage and his hands began to ball in fists."Now, I need you to understand. Astoria Greengrass is dead. She was dead the day we tried to reverse the Dark Lord's magic." Hermione spat. "That bobble-head Beuxbaton whom you met in fourth-year is long gone." Hermione strode over to Malfoy and cupped his face. "But I am here, Draco. I am not dead. I am a flesh and blood human who is standing here imploring you to dig deep into yourself. Allow yourself to fucking heal."Draco took both of Hermione's wrists and held them up to her face. "I can't allow myself to fucking heal because once I do then that means she is truly gone!" Hermione was not giving up, the smirk on her face challenged Draco to a point of no return.Malfoy shoved Hermione against the wall, and she arched herself into him. Their breathing became synched, and Hermione's eyes tore through his. Draco thought about the consequences of fucking Granger, but also the perks. He would release the built-up tension and anger. Take it out on a woman who wants nothing more but to serve. Then the other part of him was conflicted, like he would be betraying Astoria.Draco ran his hand along her jawline, and down along her body. Granger let out low breaths with every inch his hand explored. His hand wrapped back up around her neck and he was an inch from her face."What do you want, Granger?""You. I always want you."Draco leaned in, barely touched her lips, and looked into her eyes. He scoffed and lifted her chin up."I don't fuck mudbloods, anymore." Draco spat.Granger slapped his cheek and shoved his chest. "You are a loathsome cockroach, Draco Malfoy! I was good enough to fuck in fifth year, but now that you have had a taste of that blond bitch, I am not good enough anymore."Draco laughed and began to redress in his Death Eaters attire. "I am handcuffed to that bitch for the rest of my days." He winked, pulled out his wand and apparated from the Inn leaving Hermione alone in the room.She sat next to the chair, hugged her knees, and whaled out cries of heartbreak."Bloody bastard. He will come back. He always does."The next morning Theo and Draco were set off to visit Dolohov and fetch a package for the Dark Lord. The men apparated in front of the Dolohov estate, and knocked on the door. A tiny house elf led them into the foyer, and they waited for Antonin to show his face, until a familiar feminine voice peered from the other room."Is that you, Bella?" Lilla inquired while strolling into the room.Draco noticed Theo's eyes lock on her eyes, and his posture sway. Lilla looked almost in shock when she saw Theo. Draco knew that Nott fancied young Lilla Dubois back in their sixth year, so he knew this moment was going to live in his mind for days to come."I erm—uhm—sorry, we are here to see Dolohov." Theo said hesitantly.Lilla nodded. "Of course. One moment. Antonin!"The air became more tense with every passing second. Antonin appeared in front of them and put his arm around Lilla. Theo's eyes snapped on hers and she lowered her head."Welcome boys to my home. What brings you here on this fine morning?"Draco stepped forward while clutching his wand. "Orders. The Dark Lord is under the impression you have a package for him?"Antonin searched his mind and then nodded. "Ah—yes of course. Permit me a few moments." Dolohov apparated away.Lilla folded her arms and looked at the boys she had known for the past two years. It was almost like standing in the presence of strangers."How are you, Theo?" Lilla inquired lowly.Theo smiled and scoffed. "Bloody fantastic. What more could I ask for? Following around this bloody chap is work enough- ""Piss off." Draco spat with a slight smile."Do you two fancy a spot of tea?" Lilla asked while starting to walk towards the kitchen.Draco agreed, because it seemed Antonin was taking his sweet time in retrieving the Dark Lord's package. A cup of tea sounded divine. Draco began to walk through the halls of the Dolohov Estate and a painting caught his eye. It was the painting of a girl looking onto the world. She saw the moon creeping out between clouds and she could feel life waiting for her. Draco knew this painting; he had seen this painting before. It was the first painting he had ever seen Astoria make."Where'd you get this?" Draco asked Lilla.Lilla stood next to him and regarded the piece. "This? Tori painted this. She gave it to me in fifth year and told me to avoid being the girl in the canvas. However, I fear I let her down."Draco left the painting and kept creeping down the hallway. His eyes bulged from his head, when he saw her face, her lips, eyes, nose, and smile, in a photograph portrait. It was a photo of Lilla and Astoria standing in front of the Beauxbaton Academy of Magic. The girls wearing their blue uniforms, and a smile spread cheek-to-cheek. All Draco could do was look at it and have her eyes look back at his. He felt Lilla standing behind him."That was before we left for Hogwarts in '94. It seems like an eternity." Lilla said lowly.Draco nodded. "Indeed. It does." He kept looking at the girl in the photo, smiling at him. Draco refused to look at any of the photo's he kept of Astoria but this time he saw this one unwillingly. "Astoria was the most beautiful woman, even if she was a stubborn ass of a woman." Draco croaked out.Lilla, having a confused look on her face began to speak. "What do you mean wa- "Antonin appeared before them all holding a small box in his hand. "Here we are. Be sure to let the Dark Lord know all the ties were cut when retrieved."Draco snatched the box, tapped it with his wand and it turned into the size of a small jewelry box. He nodded, shook Antonin's hand, and began to walk for the door. Lilla and Antonin stood in the doorway to see the boys off."Good day Dolohov, Lilla.""Wait, Draco. Take this." Lilla handed Draco a small envelope with a crack of a smile. Draco furrowed his brows and nodded in gratitude.Nott and Malfoy were walking along the pathway to the front gates."Can you believe that old bastard getting married to Lilla? I could have made her happy." Nott said while kicking the ground.Draco, ignoring Theo, ripped open the envelope Lilla gave him. It was a photo of Astoria in the Slytherin common room in sixth year. She was sitting on the leather couch clutching a book and smiling. There was no note, or anything written on the photo. Draco shoved the photo back into his pocket, and would be forever grateful for Lilla's kindness.

    1998"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil – a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome." Draco read the quote to himself until he threw the book, Pride and Prejudice, into the wall. He looked at himself in the mirror and saw a stranger. A stranger that was starting to become a permanent resident in his reflection. The dark circles under his eyes were beginning to sink, and with every passing day more weight shed from his body. "Get yourself together, pussy." He spat at himself in the mirror. A knock on his door caused him to jolt and fidget his posture."Draco? Are you alright?" Narcissa inquired while peering in through the door.Draco nodded lowly and kept his head low. Narcissa crept behind him and squeezed his shoulder."What troubles you?""I just have a lot on my mind, mum."Narcissa cupped her son's cheeks and gave him a gentle grin. "Whiskey and anger spurts won't help with nothing. You should know that by now, just look at your father."Draco lowered his head and wanted nothing more than to please his father but at the same time, be nothing like him. Draco never forgave Lucius for hitting his mother when he was a boy. Ever since Draco became a man Lucius was wise enough not to lay a finger on Narcissa or Draco would strike back. Lucius dressed like a man, spoke like a man, but had the mindset of a coward.Narcissa picked up the book and began to flip through the notes and scribbles scattered throughout the pages. With every note she read, her face became more astounded. "'Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.' Draco, what are you doing reading this rubbish?"Draco snatched the book and placed it back onto the shelf. "Nothing. It is not my copy. It was Astoria's. It-it – was her favorite novel."Narcissa sighed. "Constantly looking at artifacts that remind you of her wil—will not ease the pain. Why not cast her aside? It has been months, my son. Perhaps your father and I can re-connect with the Parkinson's and arrange a match. I think it will- "Draco started to feel his blood boil, the veins on his neck began to appear boldly. Pansy Parkinson was the last female on his mind and marrying her was not going to solve anything. With every word that escaped Narcissa's lips Draco wanted to scream. Without thinking, in a fit of anger, he smashed his fit into the nearest wall. Narcissa gasped and ran to her son's side and cradled his bloody knuckles."What has gotten into you!" Narcissa shouted.Draco watched the blood drip off his hand and onto the carpet. He wanted to feel the pain his hand felt, the feeling of exposed skin, the ache of discomfort, but nothing outstood the pain he felt within."Sometimes physical pain carries my mind to a different place for a few minutes. When my mind is not occupied, all I want to do is fucking annihilate anyone and everything." Draco whispered coldly.Narcissa stood up abruptly and peered down at her son. The look of rage was forming on her face and she raised her hand swiftly connecting it with Draco's cheek."Bloody hell, mum!"Narcissa pointed at her son. "I did not raise you to be a blubbering fool. Astoria is not the only thing of importance. The Dark Lord is planning on striking the school any day now and Draco, you need to pull yourself together. Otherwise, we will perish. Everything we have worked for will be all for nothing!"Narcissa left the room and left Draco alone to tend to his self-inflicted wounds. While Draco was muttering healing spells over his knuckles, yet another figure appeared in his room."I heard quarreling. You a'ight mate?" Theo asked while lowering his gaze to the blood on the carpet then back at Draco."Doesn't anybody leave me the fuck alone anymore?" Draco spat while grabbing a nearby half-empty whiskey bottle."Yeah-well I was sent here to bring you down to the meeting. We're startin'." Theo said as he stole the bottle from Draco and took a swig."How—bloody—fantastic." Draco said sarcastically.Draco listened to the endless amounts of battle strategies that the different members of the council brought to the table. Draco had no intention of contributing to the war plans, until he was called upon by the Dark Lord."Young, Draco, you know Hogwarts quite well, tell me, what is the best way to infiltrate the grounds? I fear the wards have been severely upgraded since I was last there..." Voldemort said with a chuckle.Draco fixed his posture and leaned forward. "My lord, the wards are strong due to Professor Dumbledore developing them himself. Perhaps there is another way we can lure out Potter without causing total chaos."Voldemort lowered his eyes and furrowed his facial expression cuing Draco to continue his thought. "My lord simply lure Potter from the castle. Perhaps by bating him? I know for a fact the bastard is quite fond of his friends. There will be no need for more magical blood to be spilt."Voldemort nodded and fiddled with the elder wand, "Ahh-that would be a waste of precious blood. The Wizarding World's population diminishes every year..." Voldemort scanned the table hoping some of the other council members would have something to add, but the men remained quiet. Until Lucius perked up and jumped into the conversation."My lord, if you will permit me, Potter hangs around two certain kids. A Weasley boy and a mudblood. If we were able to snatch one or both, Potter will seek them out. Allowing you to strike him down."Draco heard the word mudblood and he knew his father was referring to Granger. Potter would risk his life to save his friends, no matter the cost. Draco has not seen Granger since the night at the Inn when he told her he would never call upon her again, and he meant it. But something in his gut was telling him this plan was going to jeopardize Granger's life. What if Granger sacrifices herself to save Potter? If that were the case, then Draco would kill Potter himself for being a dim whit and allowing a girl to get herself killed for him."I like your idea Draco, and your thinking Lucius. I shall fixate this plan with a close councilmember. I want Potter dead within the month, gentleman. I have waited seventeen years for this, and I will not wait another year more."Draco was beginning to turn his gaze to the nearby window when an unknown woman strode into the room. She had black hair, Asian-descent eyes, and a trimmed figure. This woman strode in and placed her hand on the Dark Lord's shoulder and Voldemort smiled at her sinisterly. Draco has only ever seen the Dark Lord smile like that when he was looking at Astoria. It made Draco's stomach curl every time he saw it."My dear! Welcome. You look divine. Just as I remember you."The woman slightly bowed her head and smiled at him. "My lord, I am thrilled to resume my position as your right hand."Draco noticed Lucius and Bellatrix shift in their seats and a scowl form over their faces. It was no surprise that his father and his aunt often fought over Voldemort's right hand man position, but he suspects neither of them expected to see an outlander steal the job."My friends, I assume you are confused. Allow me to introduce you to someone to whom you have met before, Nagini."Draco eye's bulged from his skull when he realized the woman, he was looking at was once the large, black snake that was glued to Voldemort's side since before he could remember. But how that could that be? As Draco looked at this woman more and more his brain was becoming more confused. This woman was a snake for how many years and suddenly she is a fully functioning human.The meeting concluded and Theo pulled Draco aside and invited him for a drink at the pub. The guys arrived outside a muggle pub in London, since it was no secret, they were Death Eaters and outlawed in the Wizarding community. Theo and Draco were sipping on scotches over ice and watched the lonely muggles traipse in and out of the bar. Draco envied their mindlessness, their pathetic problems and how much easier it might be to be anyone but who he is."They are going to go after the mudblood, mate. What are we going to do?" Theo inquired.Draco furrowed his brows and rose his upper lip. "What are we going to do? Bloody nothing. Granger is not my responsibility. Let Saint Potter come to her rescue. I am bloody tired of being her hero." Draco finished off his scotch and the bartender slid him another. Cheers."Mate, the Dark Lord is going to torture her until Potter sacrifices himself. Who knows what he will do to her? You cannot survive with Granger's blood on your hands- "Draco leaned forward and showed his hands. "I already have Astoria's blood on my hands! Why not just add Granger's? My soul is already damned to hell." He lowered his hands and swigged his scotch back. "Granger means nothing to me. I have not seen the bitch since—Switzerland." Draco lied.He knew if Theo found out that he had been secretly meeting up with Hermione for the past several months it would merely prove a false accusation, that he still had feelings for her.Draco scoffed to himself and smirked. "Y'know my mum actually suggested that I become arranged with Parkinson. My skull nearly exploded."Theo lowered his head and began to play with his scotch glass. "You were wrong for using Parkinson, Malfoy, y'know that right?"Draco scowled at Theo. "I did not know that we were reviewing all my past failures, Nott. Should we lay out some of yours? Let us see—you allowed Dubois to get engaged to an old Death Eater, you never fought for her—"Nott punched Malfoy on his chin and Draco fell backwards, but quickly rose to his feet. Swinging back at Nott and connecting with his nose. Theo's nose began to gush blood, and the bouncer forced the guys to leave the bar."Never talk about Lilla, you piece of shit! Unlike Astoria, Lilla is alive!" Nott shouted. Malfoy grabbed Nott's blazer jacket and pushed him to the wall. "Look at me, mate. If I were given the fucking opportunity, I would have gladly traded my life for Astoria's!"Nott smirked. "What about Granger?"Malfoy paused and released his grip on Theo. He began to pace around the walkway and cursed around his breath. "Do for Granger what you could not for Greengrass. Even if she is a mudblood."Draco began to shake his head until his dark mark started to burn, and when he lifted his sleeve the skull was shifting. Draco peered up at Theo who shared the same facial expression."We are being summoned." Theo stated. The guys whipped out their wands and apparated back to Malfoy Manor. When Draco charged through the front door, he was immediately drug into the library by his mother."Draco, promise me you will not do anything stupid." Narcissa demanded.Draco looked at his mother confused. What did she mean? Why would he do something stupid?"Mother wha- ""Shh-listen to me. Promise me no matter what happens you will put your life first. I cannot let me own son die for a- ""Cissa, Draco, please." Lucius interjected.Narcissa nodded and guided Draco down the stairs into the dining room. The Dark Lord and Nagini stood in front of the fireplace that lit up the room lowly. The Malfoy family were surrounded by the low council, the high council, and other members of the Dark Lord's army. Nagini stepped forward and waved her wand to show an outline of the grounds of Hogwarts. Draco felt his chest starting to become heavier with every word she spoke. The first battle was happening and very soon he was going to have to fight against his peers. The students of Hogwarts already thought Draco was a no-good bastard, this was going to cement the rumors."We have a responsible member retrieving either the Weasley boy or the mudblood girl. Once they are snatched, we will set up around the perimeter. If Potter does not show his face to rescue his beloved, then we will have no choice but to take him by force." Nagini said coldly.Draco stepped forward clutching his Death Eaters mask, "Who will be retrieving Potter's friends. Perhaps I may assist?"Voldemort stepped forward with a cold expression. "Absolutely not. You are to fight by my—side."Draco nodded and stepped back."Prepare for battle my friends. Tonight, we prepare, tomorrow we fight, the day after we conquer." Voldemort said boldly.Draco nodded and traipsed up to his room. His gut was telling him to get a warning to Granger, tell her about the Dark Lord's plan to kidnap her or Weaselbee. Then he had another thought, perhaps he could stop the kidnap? Go back in time and make sure the idea was never presented to the Dark Lord. Malfoy remembered that years ago Granger gifted him a time turner that would allow wizards to travel through time. He knelt into his trunk that kept all the memories of Granger a secret. The many exchanged letters, little trinkets but as he reached the bottom of the trunk there was no time turner. Where had it had gone? Had he misplaced it? Draco realized with the time turner missing he would not be able to change the past, and his only option was to act in the future.He slammed the trunk shut and sat on the top if it, hands clasped. He ran his hands through his hair and felt the air escaping his chest rapidly. Draco was not ready to fight, but he had to do everything he could to protect Granger, even if that means murder.

    1998The crisp night air filled Draco's nostrils and the breeze tickled his face. With every step through the woods, he came closer to Hogwarts. He walked along the path with his parents and Theodore Nott. All members of the high council were hidden behind the Dark Lord's mask, Draco included. Through the holes of the Death Eater's mask, he watched Bellatrix skip towards the cliff, the once snake woman, Nagini followed close. The Dark Lord informed everyone he would join them all at the foot of the grounds.Draco felt his mother slide her hand with his and she gave him a squeeze as they got closer to the cliff. Draco kept his head high and peered down at the Black Lake. He noticed the large oak tree that stood at the foot of the lake, so many interesting memories lie at one tree. The lights of the school began to dim, and Draco knew that tonight there would be bloodshed."All of you! Shut up!" Bellatrix roared.Draco took his position next to his aunt and waited for the Dark Lord to appear and announce his orders. He was glad no one could see the terrified look on his face behind the mask. The armor of his uniform was beginning to feel heavier as the night went on. If Potter were smart, he would show his face and get what was coming to him.Draco wondered if Granger would be the one that got kidnapped and used as bait. He secretly hoped it would be Weaselbee so he did not have to step in. Draco fixed his cufflinks until he heard a crack and Lord Voldemort appeared before him with a sinister smile."Draco... tonight is the night we conquer. As reward for fighting for me, I grant you the position of my right-hand man. When the war is concluded you will be my successor. How does that sound, my boy?" Voldemort said proudly.Draco could barely take a breath before nodding his head. He had no choice but to accept Voldemort's proposal. Draco was the one who killed the only wizard Voldemort feared most, Albus Dumbledore. Draco had only killed one man in his life, and he feared he would be spilling more blood as his years progressed. If that was the case, he hoped his years were numbered.Voldemort peered around at the members of his army and smiled. He held his hand to his chest and began to clap slowly, his soldiers copied. "My friends! It has been brought to my attention that Potter's bait has been secured! TONIGHT, WE STAND FOR THE WIZARDING WORLD!"Draco shifted in his stance and waited impatiently to hear which one of the Potter's friends had been captured. Draco had every intention of saving Granger from the torture of Lord Voldemort, whisking her away to safety, until he saw something that would change him forever."STEP FORWARD WITH THE PREY, MY DEAR!" Voldemort exclaimed.Within the crowd of Death Eaters, snatchers, soldiers, and mythical creatures, out came a woman. A woman with hair white as snow and that touched below her chest. The woman strode forward in a long, black laced dress. Her eyes big and brown, lips as red as blood. A smirk plastered across her face. Draco slowly removed his Death Eater's mask to see if his eye's deceived him, and they did not. The woman who was walking through the crowd was Astoria, and on her hand was the neck of Hermione Granger.Draco felt his heart begin to race and his mind start to fog. He felt he was watching a ghost walk toward him. Astoria was dead, he was sure of this. The Order of the Phoenix killed her themselves. If that much was true then how was she standing here, very much alive?Draco was in utter shock and could not tare his eyes away from the ghost of the woman he once loved. For that ghost grasped onto the woman who was in love with Draco. An immediate heartache began to take form within Draco's chest every step Astoria took. For a split-second Astoria's eyes connected with Draco's and he felt everything he once had before."Master, I have brought the mudblood you seek." Astoria said coldly while yanking on Hermione's neck to make her face visible.Voldemort strode over and took Astoria's hand. "Well done, my dear! You really were the perfect person for the task."Astoria chuckled and smirked. "It brought me great joy to serve you, my lord." Astoria lunged Hermione to ground, and Granger yelped as she hit the floor.Draco watched Granger on the ground, and then his eyes snapped back to Astoria. He had not laid eyes on this woman for, what it seemed like, years and here she was. He feared he would never again see her beauty, how her skin glistened underneath the moonlight, or how her smile sent chills throughout his body. Then just as Draco was holding his breath, Astoria strode over to him and was inches from his face. His expression, cold, her face, stern. For a mere moment, her eyes connected with his, but no words were exchanged.Astoria then took a stance next to Draco and it took every ounce of his being not to grab hold of her face and connect their lips. But all he could was hold his posture and cease the moment to snatch Granger and apparate her to safety. That was his plan, until Voldemort derailed his thoughts."I want this blood traitor hidden." Voldemort locked eyes with Astoria. "My darling rose of a girl, if you would not mind, pay me another kindness and keep the mudblood out of sight."Astoria nodded and immediately grabbed hold of Hermione's arm, as she was dragging a struggling Hermione down the woods Voldemort ordered Draco to accompany them.The three of them apparated into a secluded part of the Dark Forest and Draco feared that Saint Potter would be too late to save Granger if he could not locate her. Once again, Draco might have to play the hero for Granger, but how could he when it is Astoria who has her by the throat? Draco told himself that he would be willing to commit murder to protect Granger, does that include the woman he claims to have once loved?"I demand fucking answers." Draco spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and lunged Hermione against a large tree. By waiving her wand, she magically bonded Hermione to tree so there was no escape for her."How they bloody hell are you alive?" Hermione inquired coldly. "The Order assured me that you- ""Do shut up." Astoria spat while casting the silencio charm over Hermione. Astoria exhaled and reached into her pocket to pull out a cigarette. She took a large inhale and a broad exhale. "Oh—how I have missed this." Astoria rose an eyebrow and glared at Draco who was standing broadly with his mouth barely hanging open. Astoria let out a small chuckle. "Hmm—Draco Lucius Malfoy." Astoria ran her hand up and down Draco's Death Eater uniform. "Looking rather dashing." She winked.Draco grabbed hold of Astoria's hand and yanked her forward. "How the fuck are you here, Astoria?"Astoria smirked and got within inches of his face. He could smell her perfume, and the dark magic radiating off her body. It was almost euphoric. The amount of emotion that was gathered inside him all due to the presence of one woman, was inexplicability grand."Let us play a game." Astoria said while galloping over to Hermione. Astoria lifted her dress to expose an enclosed knife that hung on her garter. She yanked Hermione by the ponytail and gently slid the knife around her face and neck."Greengrass!" Draco yelped out. "Get the fuck off her!"Astoria laughed, but left no marks on Hermione, yet. She waived the knife around and batted her eyes. "Answer my questions truthfully and I will, fail to do so and I will be forced to jam this blade straight into her bleeding heart."Draco lunged forward; wand drawn but with every step he took Hermione's eyes locked with his. He stood in his position and dropped his wand."True or false, while you thought I was dead you sought comfort from this slut."Draco remained silent for a moment before raising his hands in surrender. "Astoria... please... let her go."Astoria rolled her eyes and yanked Hermione upward by her ponytail. She smiled into her face and chuckled. "Wrong answer." Astoria left a slash on Hermione's cheek and blood fell from her face. Draco watched Hermione's eye's crease as the blade impaled her cheek and the horror in her eyes."Fuck—damnit. Yes—yes I saw her while you were gone."Astoria nodded and released the blade from Hermione's cheek, lunging her back to the ground. Hermione, still unable to speak, attempted her best at legilimens to get into Draco's head."She thinks you cheated on her, with me." Draco heard in his mind and his eyes shot open wide. He understood why Astoria was hurting, and why Hermione was her target. Astoria's old memories of the runic procedure were blocked behind a barrier of betrayal."Question two." Astoria strolled forward and held her blade under Draco's chin. The blade had a slight discoloration from Granger's cheek. "When you stuck your dirty prick inside her, it was my face you saw. True or false?"Draco knew that if he explained the truth to Astoria that she would go into a mental state of shock. By Draco being the one to break down the walls, without the object that contained her memories, Astoria would be lost. It bothered him deeply that Astoria would think that he would be unfaithful to her, but to what extent did she believe him to be unfaithful? In some ways he was unfaithful, but in the most important way he has been faithful to her even in her presumed death."I see your face everywhere whether I want too or not." Draco spat.Astoria chuckled and licked the side of the blade and proceed to spit the blood onto the forest floor. "Dirty blood." She murmured.Draco turned his head to hear the rustling of footsteps approaching behind him, at this exact moment he witnessed Granger's eyes widen. With his wand clutched in hand, he spun around and had it pointed at the figure stealthily approaching."Weasley." Draco spat."Get your bloody hands off my girlfriend you hag!" Ron shouted at Astoria.Astoria let out a soft laugh and made eye contact with Ron. Ron nearly lost his footing when he realized who it was."Tori? What the devil? So then-the-the rumors were true... You really are his-""The rumors usually are correct. I am happy you joined the party. We were just discussing a great betrayal." Astoria said while twiddling the blade in her hand.Draco lowly unsilenced Granger with a charm and signaled for her to stay quiet. Draco was unaware of Granger being in a relationship with Ron Weasley, but at the same time he was not surprised. He always knew Weasley fancied Granger, but he never figured she would stoop to the level of being in a relationship with him. The utter thought made his stomach turn."Hmmm—what an interesting turn of events. We have two whores here today—""Hermione is no whore you bitch!" Ron shouted.Astoria let out a high laugh and crossed her arms. "Ron-Ron-Ron! Do you not understand? I may be the whore that bounced between men of the houses, but this one." Astoria held up Hermione by her ponytail. "Now this one is a special type of whore. Miss. Granger is the type of whore who is deceitful and stealthy.""Greengrass, shut the fuck up. Don't- "Draco started to say before Astoria cut him off."Ron do you love this mudblood?" Astoria inquired.Ron nodded and drew his wand. "I always have, and she loves me, no doubt."Astoria crouched down and looked into Granger's tear-filled eyes. Astoria whispered into Hermione's ear and Granger began to cry harder. Draco watched the tears stream down her face faster each unknown word Astoria spoke.Astoria shot up with Hermione and began to stroll over to Ron and Draco. Astoria faced Hermione and spoke coldly. "Choose."Hermione furrowed her brows and began to plead. "What? No. Please!"Draco yanked onto Astoria wrist and attempted to make her drop the knife. Draco knew what she was hinting at. "Enough!""Who do you love Hermione?" Astoria mocked."Astoria, I beg you... I..." Hermione pleaded breathlessly."'Mione?" Ron questioned. "Tell me it is not true."Hermione fell to the floor and began to heave. "Ron, I-I- ""I am growing impatient." Astoria said mockingly while waving the knife. Astoria attempted to shove the blade into Draco's side, but it merely pierced the skin. Hermione cried out and Ron ran to her side."Sorry, darling." Astoria whispered to Draco."'Mione sweetheart tell me it is not true. You cannot possibly be in love with- ""Ron I—I am sorry.""Weasley." Draco spat. "It is not what you think...""I said choose Granger!"Hermione looked up at Ron and planted a kiss upon his lips. She embraced him tight and whispered an apology in his ear. Ron shook his head and held tightly onto her hand.Without speaking Astoria strode over and impaled the blade into Ron's back causing him to fall to the ground. Draco ran up behind Astoria and pulled her back and he watched Hermione cradle the lifeless corpse of Ronald Weasley in her arms."Now you feel the pain of loss." Astoria spat.The thunder of crashing wards around the castle were beginning to crumble. The Dark Lord must be growing agitated with Harry Potter refusing to show his face. The war was about to commence, and Draco knew that Astoria needed to be at the Dark Lord's side, if she was not he would seek her out.Draco held onto Astoria's arms and refused to relinquish her from his grasp. "It is starting, Greengrass. Get out of here."Astoria smirked and with a short crack, apparated before his eyes. Draco immediately ran to Hermione's side and watched her chest heave. Hermione grasped onto Ron's growingly cold body and with every moment passing she was becoming soaked in blood. The sounds of Granger's cry of despair were enough to make any person's stomach curl."This is all my fault." Draco whispered while placing his hand on Hermione's back. A few moments of silence went by before Granger lifted her head to meet Draco's grey eyes."No, it's mine." Hermione exclaimed while stroking Ron's red hair.Hermione placed a single kiss upon Ron's forehead and laid his body back onto the ground. Draco pulled Hermione off the ground and brought her into his arms. He pulled out his wand and apparated them to the front gates of Hogwarts. Draco put Hermione down and she embraced him tightly."Come with me." She whispered.Draco released her and put his hand on the jawline of her face. He pondered for a moment the option Granger was giving him. In this very moment he could flee the Dark Lord's army, fight for the resistance, and hopefully put an end to this madness. However, then he realized who he would be fighting against. Astoria was alive and she was lost within the dark magic that consumed her. With every step he took away from her the more of a pull he felt to go back to that Beuxbaton girl trapped within the body of a monster.Draco shook his head and relinquished his grasp. As he took a few steps away, Hermione grabbed onto his forearm and pulled him in. She connected their lips and he melted at her touch. It had been such a long while since he kissed or felt intimacy. Draco cupped Hermione's face and she released a low moan into his mouth. He nipped the bottom of her lip and she tasted delightful. With every kiss they exchanged the more wrong it felt. Draco fell in love with Hermione Granger once upon a time, he would have moved heaven and Earth for her. He felt the connection within the passion of the kiss, but it was nothing compared to what he once shared with Astoria Greengrass."Hermione?" A voice said from behind them."Harry!" Hermione said embarrassed. "I-we-were—""Malfoy?" Potter said in a shocked voice.Malfoy rolled his eyes and apparated.
  
    Chapter Text
    1998Astoria walked up and down the halls that held so many memories. Some wonderful, and some downright awful. Fucking Merlin, some were awful. Astoria marched up the Astronomy Tower stairs and gazed down to the fight below her. The sounds of curses and defensive spells filled her ears. A sense of emptiness filled her soul, but physically she was disgusted. Not only with herself, but everyone around her. Within a matter of a year, she lost everyone she loved, and it was all due to one blood tainted woman, Hermione fucking Granger.Astoria gripped the railing and stretched her arms. So many memories filled the very space she was inhabiting. In the very spot where she stood is when she attempted to take her own life when Cedric humiliated her at the Yule Ball. It was also the night Malfoy knocked sense into her head. Malfoy was always there. No matter how much Astoria tried to tare her mind away from that pale man he was always tangled within the stem of her brain.Astoria once thought she was different from Malfoy, intellectually. She always thought of herself as a strong-willed woman who could conquer anything if she worked hard enough. Malfoy seemed like the man who enjoyed being handed things. No matter what it was it seemed everything came easy to him, including snatching up women. Pansy Parkinson threw herself at him all through her years at Hogwarts. Now Astoria was coming to the realization that she and Malfoy were not all different from one another. They were both murderers, followers of the Dark Lord and they were both owned. She liked to believe once that Draco was going to be the one that saved her from her Master, that in some way he would have found a solution to the magic of the runic imprint. That day never fucking came.Astoria now stands here as the most hated, feared, and trapped woman in the Wizarding World. She has killed innocent people, and in the most heartless way, she felt nothing. Not a speck of remorse for the ones she is killed. After the day she found Draco with Hermione, Astoria's world collapsed. She became consumed in her own thoughts and decided being numb was easier. Muggle life or wizarding life had no meaning to her anymore. Damn them all."Tori?" A deep voice said from behind her.Astoria turned around sharply to see the tall, dark figure, Theodore Nott standing before her. Astoria would be lying to herself if she said she had not missed talking with Theo. During her time at Hogwarts, he became one of her most trusted allies. He kept the secret of her identity, and he never betrayed her. Not once."Theo... How-how did you find me?" She said breathlessly while being caught off guard.Theo chuckled. "I know you all too well." Theo walked toward her and tipped her chin up to expose her eyes. "I'm with you in this y'know? We all are."Astoria let out a laugh then a scoff and began thrashing her arms. She was not used to someone being supportive towards her. All she heard anymore were orders, words of betrayal or meaningless apologies. "Yeah-okay. Listen, go babysit Malfoy Jr. I am fine here."Theo grabbed hold of Astoria's arm and swung her around. "I am here to babysit you. I am here to make sure you remain fucking breathing. Otherwise, Malfoy will- ""That is always what it is about! Draco this or Draco that! What about me? Nobody ever cares about my well-being for myself. I am always kept alive for the sake of somebody else!"Astoria relinquished herself from Theo's grip and began to run down the Astronomy Tower stairs. The sounds of the battle became more apparent with every step she took."Fucking Merlin, Astoria! Wait!" Theo shouted.Astoria ran into a nearby vacant hallway and waited until Theo left her pathway. She turned her gaze to notice she was in the Hall of Hero's and all the portraits were staring at her. One called out to her."Ria?"Astoria almost lost herself when she saw Cedric's face staring back at her."Cedric?" Astoria stepped forward standing in front of a portrait of Cedric Diggory from 1994."What happened to you?"She then noticed the name plaque that was at the bottom of the portrait.Cedric Diggory. 1977-1994. Triwizard Champion, beloved friend and son.Astoria felt tears rolling down her cheeks and she sniffled. "This is what happens to a person when their hearts shatters and it's put back together too many times."Cedric looked at Astoria and his eyes scanned her new façade. She was thinner, paler, and more corrupted as a young woman physically could be. She was no longer the Beauxbaton transfer Cedric once knew."I'm lost." She whispered as she collapsed onto the floor while hugging her knees.Cedric's portrait huffed and spoke lowly. "You are still the girl I once loved, Ria. She's just been tucked away."Astoria eyes turned and she furrowed her brows. How dare Cedric say he loved her when he humiliated her and used her for sex. Astoria wiped her tears away and stood on her feet."You never loved me." Astoria spat. "You used me for a quick shag you Huffledick." Astoria gripped her wand and pointed it at the portrait. Cedric was already dead so he would not feel a thing. "Incendio." Astoria watched the portrait burn before her eyes, and at this moment she felt some peace. Fire was cleansing her past betrayals. Perhaps fire was the answer to her problems. Just as she was about to exit the hall, Theo came charging toward her. Astoria huffed and waited for him to approach."Congratulations, you found me. Shall we play another game of hide n' seek?"Theo grabbed hold of Astoria's hand and began to guide her onto free grounds of Hogwarts, away from the fight. "Let me go! It is time to end this war! My Master needs Potter and I am charged with finding the bastard." Astoria spat.Theo spun her around and held onto her arms. "You are not going anywhere. Malfoy told me to keep a close eye on you and damnit I am going to."Astoria chuckled and cocked her head. "How adorable. Are you Malfoy's errand boy now?""You nearly killed him, Astoria. He was a wreck without you- ""Bullshit. He was taking comfort in mudblood ass last time I checked."Theo looked at her with a confused expression but later he sighed. Astoria wondered why Theo was so surprised at her stating what happened between Draco and Granger. Surely, Theo must know what Draco did with Hermione that ended Astoria's relationship. Then as she was peering behind Theo's head, she saw the platinum blond head of a man approaching them in the distance. She knew it was Draco coming to check up on them. Merlin knows why.Astoria was feeling a tad petty in this moment. Even thought she almost murdered Draco's true love in the forest, perhaps a small touch of jealousy to add to the roster of heartbreak.Slowly, Astoria drew her wand and pointed it at Theo. Sorry Theo. Astoria thought to herself. "Imperio." Astoria got close to Theo's face and it was almost like controlling a doll. "Kiss me." She whispered. With every second that passed Draco marched closer and closer. Theo cradled his hand on Astoria's jawline, paused for a moment and then connected their lips. Astoria kissed him passionately by arching herself into him and wrapping her arms around Theo's neck.Almost as if she predicted it, she felt the kiss break abruptly by Draco's arms thrashing them apart. The curse that was casted over Theo was broken and he was left disorientated."What the bloody fuck is going on here?" Draco said aggressively.Astoria laughed and shrugged. "Sorry darling, I guess I am just so irresistible."Draco peered down at Theo and tried to hold his head up but it went limp."You cursed him... didn't you?"Astoria shrugged. "Does it look like I use dark magic?" Smirk.Astoria heard the cries of the many students and she knew it was the moment she had been yearning for the moment she stepped back on these cursed grounds. These walls carried her uttermost secrets, the most pain she had ever felt in her life and the most erotic feeling of love she will ever feel. It is highly unlikely she will ever feel such things again. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was a stomping ground for old ghosts that would forever taunt Astoria. She had already taken care of Cedric's bloody portrait; it was time to permanently cleanse her soul of the heartache that rested within the very structure of this castle.Astoria strode over to Draco and traced his jawline with her finger. It had been so long since she touched him. How she craved this man. It was almost pathetic. Astoria leaned in and whispered to him in French."Puisse-t-il pleuvoir du feu et nettoyer le sol." Astoria disapparated before Draco's eyes._________________________________________"Blimey, she is going to scorch us all." Draco whispered to himself.Draco apparated an unconscious Theo to the woods and returned swiftly back to the castle. Draco began trudging through the battle ground, blocking curses as they came his way. Shooting a hex at a nearby Hufflepuff who sent a disarming charm his way. Nice try sweetie. He managed to scurry through the main archway until an unexpected stunner shot at his shoulder and sent him against the wall."You coward. You bloody coward. Fight back, Malfoy." Potter charged at him shooting red disarming charms every half second.Malfoy sent a stunner back at Saint Potter and he barely nicked his shoulder. Come on."You killed Ron! My best friend you bloody bastard!"Draco rolled his eyes and sent another stunner at Potter, finally it hit him in the chest and Potter's back flung to the backwall. Draco huffed and stood in front of a breathless Harry Potter."You! Malfoy, you bloody bastard. I'll end you!"Draco pulled him up and shoved him back against the wall. "Don't be pathetic. I didn't kill Weasel-bee."Draco began to walk away until Potter charged at him and punched him square in the nose. Draco did not have time for such childish brawling. He needed to find Astoria before she burned down the entire fucking castle."Hermione said you did, you bastard!" Potter said while attempting to swing once more.Draco sent a small hex at Potter and he fell to his knees. "You're in love with Hermione, are you not? That's why you killed Ron!"Draco began to pace, and his chest started rising rapidly. It was time to end Draco and Hermione. There was never a Draco and Hermione. It had always been just Draco, until an inconvenient pesky blonde entered his midst. It appeared even in death Draco would always yearn for either the Beauxbaton transfer student who almost pitched herself off the Astronomy Tower or Lord Voldemort's faithful servant."I was never in love with Hermione. It was always, Astoria." Draco said in Potter's face. "Get yourself out, Potter. Get them all out. You can't win this one.""Light will always triumph against evil." Potter spat.Draco chuckled to himself as he was charging through the hallways. "Soon it'll be light enough for the entire bloody world to see."As Draco continued to duel his way through the halls in his search for the pesky blond, he felt something clang around in his breast pocket. He reached his hand inside to reveal a tiny vial. It was the vial Albus Dumbledore handed him before Draco executed him.He had not even noticed but he was standing outside the staircase of the Headmaster's office. Draco knew enough to pour the vial into the pensieve.Draco stood over the floating pool and poured the liquid inside and watched how it turned black. Something was pulling him further, further, and further until he felt as if he were falling endlessly.He finally landed promptly on his two feet and around him was Hogwarts castle ablaze. The memories of him walking through the doors of the great hall, flying around on his broom in the quad, even the bloody tree where Moody transfigured him into a ferret, all being burned to the ground.As Draco walked further along the rubble, he felt someone touch his shoulder. He spun around to see Albus Dumbledore."Hello Draco.""Professor? How? How am I? How are you- "Draco then paused and felt ashamed. "Oh-Professor. I am so sorry- "Dumbledore put up his hand to silence the young wizard. "No time for that. Did you happen to notice what is going on around us?"Draco furrowed his brows and took a glance at the burning castle that stood before him. "Yeah erm—I may have taken note of the rapid fire...""Do you realize who is responsible?"Draco sighed. "Astoria."Albus remained silent until he spoke with integrity. "In order to fix what is already happening. Something needs to be sacrificed to ensure balance."This old man was speaking nonsense. What the bloody fuck did he mean? Balance? Balance for who or for what? There would never be balance between light and dark, one always must triumph."Sir, I don't follow."Albus sighed and clasped his elderly hands at his front. "It's not your fault who you're bonded with. What matter is how you sever the toxicity of the bond."Draco spun abruptly to face the dead wizard. "I will never elude Astoria from my life. When I was under the impression, she was killed I was in agony. Nothing had meaning anymore. Are you telling me that for this- "Draco held out his arms to show the inferno. "-not to happen I have to give her up. AGAIN?"Albus lowered his head. "She is no longer the girl you once knew. Astoria Greengrass must be eluded from the equation entirely."Draco's eyes became rageful and his fist swelled. Absolutely fucking not. There was no way in Merlin that anything more was going to happen to this girl. His girl.Draco pulled his head from the water and charged to the only place left to look for that dark magic ruined blond. The Astronomy Tower. How many memories were spent in one tiny location.As Draco ascended the stairs, he saw the bottom of a ripped of lace dress and it hugged the body of the woman he loved the most."Hello."Astoria spun around to reveal the cigarette she was smoking. Of course, she was smoking, this girl was always smoking. One of her worst habits by far."Shouldn't you be off taking care of Theo?"Draco approached her carefully and shrugged. "I'm not his babysitter."Astoria scoffed and flicked her bud. She lowered her hand in her palm and looked out below the railing. "Can I ask you something?"Draco stood next to her cautiously, hoping she would not throw him off the edge. He nodded in agreement."What did she have that I did not?"Draco knew that underneath all the anger, jealousy and bravery façade laid a girl who felt scorned. Astoria's heart was in pieces and it seemed almost impossible to fit the broken pieces back together.Astoria shifted in her stance after a few seconds of Draco's silence."Astoria you have no idea- "She flicked the cigarette off the side and began to charge away. "I can't do this."Draco was not going to let her get away he yanked her by the arm and shoved her in place against the wall. Their faces barely touching, he could smell her hair and watched her breathing slow."You broke me. More than anyone else." Astoria whispered.Draco watched the trail of tears that fell from her eyes. He wanted so badly to explain everything, give her, her memories back and show her that even though their relationship is far from perfect, they still had each other. But without the power of the ring that rested on Narcissa's hand that contained the hidden memories, it was no use.Draco instead rested his head on Astoria's shoulder and just embraced her. She did not try to fight him, but instead he felt her arms wrap around his torso and hug him tightly.Astoria whispered into Draco's ear. "Come with me and help me end this. Please."Draco looked into her tear-filled eyes and ran his thumb over her lip. In this moment he wanted to connect his lips with hers, whisk her away to safety and never look back. Was it possible?"I can't." He murmured.Astoria slowly left his grasp and disapparted without another word. Draco rammed his fist into the wall and cursed under his breath.Draco was about to charge back into the Forbidden Forest when he heard the screaming cries from the students. He peered onto the battle ground to witness the Death Eater's carrying Potter tethered by ropes. He was covered in snake bite marks and looked as if he had no fight left in him.Draco stood in the background of the students and only one person stood out amongst the crowd across the way. The blond that wanted to runaway with him but moments ago. Astoria stood with Nagini at Voldemort's side. Draco heard the whispers of the students around him."I know that blond..." A Ravenclaw block said."Isn't that that Beauxbaton las that slept with Cedric Diggory?" Another Huffledick-Hufflepuff said.Fools they all were. None of them understood what was happening to Astoria every year she stepped foot on these grounds.Draco knew within the next few moments that light was never going to triumph. Nagini came up behind Potter with a blade and slashed open his throat. Potter fell to the ground and bled out onto the grounds.The screams of the Hogwarts staff and students were devastating to hear. One scream caught his hear and it came from a mournful curly brown-haired girl in the front, Hermione Granger. Draco realized in this moment that her two best friends were both killed on the same day, before her eyes."Harry Potter is dead! You will now look to me as your Lord! My darling girl- "Voldemort held out his hand and Astoria took it gladly. "If you will please." Voldemort exclaimed.Astoria stepped forward in her tattered lace dress and took a large inhale. She pointed her wand to the sky and screamed, "Incendio Maxima!" Fire sparked from her wand and it began to cling onto every solid structure it could find. Students began to run in circles and teachers started to apparate kids to safety.Every few seconds Astoria kept repeating the spell at the castle, "Incendio Maxima!" The Death Eater's began to disapparate to safety and Draco noticed Nagini giving Astoria a reassuring hand squeeze before she fled the scene.Within moments the castle began to burn, and the battle ground was almost completely empty until Draco showed his face."Are you happy now? You're burning down the whole fucking place, Greengrass!" Draco exclaimed.Astoria spun around quickly and was surprised to see Draco it seemed. She casted small hexes at him and he dodged them naturally. With every hex she casted he just inched further toward her.Draco was a foot from this woman and all around them was a fire. "You have done enough. Come." Draco spat.Astoria casted the charm once more at a nearby archway. "NO! This castle ruined who I was! I want it BURNED!" She began pacing in circles like a mad woman.Draco held onto both her arms and made her drop her wand. "LET ME GO! DRACO!" She wailed.Draco picked up the tiny woman and flung her over his shoulder. "Ahh—how nice it is to hear you say my name again." He purred.He carried her while she was thrashing like a toddler. "Congratulations, Greengrass. You got your wish. Now it is time to get out of here.""PUT ME DOWN!" She wailed.Draco finally did put her down when they reached the end of the bridge. When Astoria turned around, she saw the flames that she created spreading throughout the grounds.Draco embraced her tightly and the tighter he squeezed the more Astoria got emotional. Something inside her seemed to be breaking down. Draco felt her breathing get heavier and her heartbeat began to race. Draco let her go to cup her face."We are getting out of here. Leaving this all behind."Astoria shook her head and spun around. She lifted her hair to reveal the runic imprint on her neck. Then she turned around to grab Draco's forearm to reveal his dark mark. "We are tethered.""I almost went bloody mad when I lost you once. I won't go through it again." Draco murmured.Without another word Astoria leaped up to connect their lips. The spark that enriched the kiss was something like no other. The passion that filled their bodies the moment they connected was something Draco felt with no other woman.It had felt like eternity since he kissed Astoria's lips, and at one point in time Draco feared he would never have the opportunity again. Draco slid his tongue into her mouth and began to massage his tongue with hers, causing her to let out a low moan.How good it felt to hear her moan again, even if it was just a low kiss moan. It was something that filled every erotic feeling in his body."I love you. I fucking love you. I—" Astoria said while being consumed by her own emotions. Her eyes filled with tears and her breath unsteady.Draco cupped her face and whispered. "I have always loved you."Draco was about to connect their lips once more until he heard rustling from the forest. He pulled Astoria behind him and drew his wand."Draco?" A familiar voice called out. "Oh, my son!" Narcissa exclaimed.She pulled her son for a tight embrace and planted a kiss on his cheek. "Mother! Thank goodness you got out before erm—that." Draco said while nudging his head to the nearby fire."Of course, I got out dear. I stayed to make sure you were safe and I erm—see you got someone else out as well. I am pleased to see you, Astoria..." Narcissa said sharply while squeezing Astoria's hand.Draco noticed the black diamond ring that was nestled on Narcissa's finger. The ring that contained the memories Astoria needed. Very soon the magic was going to be reversed and Astoria would realize the truth."Astoria, sweetheart, it is not safe for you in these woods. Apparate back to the Manor and you will find Dolohov. Miss. Dubois is awaiting you. Then by tomorrow we will be taking you two to a safe house." Narcissa said.Astoria nodded her head and gave Draco a small smile. It was all going to be put behind them. The war, the battle, the betrayal it was time the couple reconciled. Astoria apparated in an instant leaving the mother and son alone."Mother shall we return home as well?" Draco inquired.Narcissa began to fiddle with the ring and cocked her head. "Not yet, dear."Almost like lightening Draco hit the floor and he heard footsteps trail up near him. He could not move; his limbs went numb."Severus, careful!" Narcissa stated. "Now, this will be done just as I have instructed?"Severus sat up Draco in the chair he conjured up. Draco still unable to move or speak was utterly confused."Indeed. We had a bargain and I keep my end." Severus spat. Narcissa disapparted and left the two men alone."I do apologize Draco." Severus said lowly. Severus held his wand over Draco's head and began to murmur the charm, "Memorada Exforum."Draco tried to thrash himself free but the power of the immobilize charm was against him. Every time Severus repeated the charm Draco's head became fuzzier until he came to the point of utter clarity.Severus allowed Draco to move his limbs and he stared into his eyes and then spoke lowly."Draco, who is Astoria Greengrass?"Draco propped himself and looked at Severus with intent. "She is the woman I love."Severus scoffed and pointed his wand at Draco once more. Draco felt his mind fading and his palms beginning to sweat? What the devil was Severus doing to his head? Suddenly Draco slumped in his seat and began to hold his head. His cranium felt like Fire."Draco, who is Astoria Greengrass?" Snape asked once more.Draco shifted in the seat and scoffed."Astoria Greengrass? She is a French whore. I dated her for awhile before I realized how much a skank she is. I cannot fathom how she is pure-blooded. She is pathetic." Draco spat.Severus nodded, paused for a moment, and spoke again. "Do you have any feelings for her?"Draco paused, thought deeply about this question, and realized it was a stupid question at that."Why would I?"Severus nodded once more and whispered to himself, "It's done."Astoria was under the impression that all was going to be well, and that her past discretions were forgiven. How can anything be forgiven when reality is not as it seems?
  
    Chapter Text
    1999Astoria stood in silence as this drunken man lay his head on her shoulder. The feeling of his body pressed against hers was enticing and it felt bloody amazing. However, she was at a loss for words for how she was feeling. If she could list out everything, she knew to be true it would go in this order.Draco cheated on her in their sixth year with Hermione Granger, a mudblood whore. Fact. Astoria had never felt the kind of love she felt for Draco Malfoy again. Fact. Draco and Astoria were to be married in a matter of months. Fact. The marriage was Astoria's idea. Fact. Draco would never fall back into love with Astoria again while Granger walks the Earth. Fucking fact.Astoria hesitated before she raked her fingers through Draco's soft hair. For a moment she thought he was reaching up to touch her lower back, but he quickly receded. After moments of slow breaths, and soft embraces. Astoria slowly lifted Draco's head and peered into his grey eyes. When she looked into his eyes, they were not the same as they once were. Something was different, off even. Why was it when he looked at her, she felt a liar stared back at her?"Why don't I help you to bed? Huh?" Astoria inquired while linking her arm with his.Draco nodded and they began to walk down the cold, uninviting hallway of the Manor. Astoria felt the wonderous eyes of the Malfoy family portraits burning through her with every step she took.Astoria pushed open Draco's door and laid him on his bed. As she was walking out, in his drunken state, he spoke lowly."Wha-why isss-is it that when I think about you—you I hate you--, but when I touch you—I feel comfort...?"Astoria stopped herself in her tracks and was utterly speechless. It was not quite a compliment that escaped Draco's lips, but a strange inquiry. Was he asking her that question or himself? It had been the first decent statement Draco has made toward Astoria since her arrival. The fire whiskey must have had an intense effect for him to be speaking such nonsense.Astoria had her hand on the doorknob at this very moment she could escape this moment and not think about it again. Put it to the back of her mind as if Draco had never said a word. This gorgeous man was in a drunken state and surely, he would not remember an ounce of tonight. Astoria took this opportunity and seized it to express herself without judgement."When I think about you all I feel is tenderness, but when I look at you..." She hesitated and found the strength to speak the truth. "...all I see is treachery."She gripped onto the doorknob and kept trying to turn it, but her mind was disabling her. She had no choice but to look at Draco once more before she fled the scene. As she turned around this young wizard had his head in his hands and looked utterly distressed. It must have been the fact that she was engaged to Draco that she strode over and knelt before him.Draco looked down at her with a cold expression and she laid a hand on his knee. "I know... this is not what you hoped for in life... but bear with me." Astoria stood, and turned around before him. She lifted her hair slowly to expose the runic imprint on her neck. "I am inhibited." She turned and slowly exposed Draco's forearm to show the skull of the Dark Mark that glowed on his pale skin. "You are tethered."Draco's breathing seems to have slowed but his eyes never left hers. Astoria felt it in her bones that something was hidden behind his eyes. She could feel the desire from him to touch her and expose his soul. But something was holding him back, and it was not himself. She spoke once more and felt hot tears roll down her cheeks.Draco finally spoke. "Every time I look at you my skull begins to burn like fire. Get out." He spat.Astoria felt as if she could rip her hair out. Here she was, on her literal knee's, imploring this man to give her a chance and bear with her through the process. Even after she let him embrace her, and she took his drunken arse to bed. Astoria is entitled to a little bit of cooperation.Astoria rose to her feet and began to pace around the room. "Absolutely not. You do not speak to me that way. Who do you think you are?"Malfoy rose abruptly and stomped his way over to her. His upper lip furrowed along with his brows. This man had a short fuse, and Astoria was never afraid to light the match."Your husband." He spat.Astoria grazed her eyes across his torso and pursed her lips. "Not yet." She whispered in his ear.As she was about to make her exit Malfoy grabbed hold of her wrist and lowered his head. Merlin, it was almost as if this man was bipolar. In the split of an instant his mood shifts. One moment he is knocking at Astoria's door, drunk, and then the next he his screaming at her to leave his presence. Make up your damn mind."I need you to let me go."Draco kept hold of her wrist with a soft grip. Then he began to look at her face. Astoria looked into his eyes and saw the man she fell in love with. The broken shell of a boy who never had a choice in the world. She always felt they were a perfect fit, until Hermione Granger fell into the picture. Filthy mudblood."I tried." He murmured."Sure you did. Your letter really explained that. I am going to bed- "After the Battle of Hogwarts concluded, Astoria was under the impression that Draco and her would be whisked away to a safe house. Astoria never made it to the safe house, and Draco never returned to the Manor for her. All she got from him after that night was a pathetic letter."Erm--letter? Ugh--- Why couldn't you be happy with me?" Draco said pathetically.Astoria fell into confusion. Why was he asking her the reason they could not be happy? Was he not around the past two years when their relationship went to Hell?"You ruined us. Not me." Astoria spat while releasing her wrist and making a charge for the door. Draco slammed his shut and boxed her in. "Who are you to tell me what I have ruined? You have no idea what I think!"Astoria arched herself against the door and kept her hands to herself. "You know what you have done- ""And you know what you have done, Astoria. You whored yourself around the entire school." Draco spat.Once again calling her a whore, it was nothing unusual, she was used to it. However, Astoria would be lying if she said it did not sting a little every time, she heard it."Tell me you didn't see this whore's face every time you were pounding through your mudblood, bitch."Draco smashed his hand against the door and huffed. Astoria let out a low scoff and shoved the pale blond off her. "Pleasant dreams."Astoria was walking back towards her room when she noticed Lucius strolling through with his cane. Offlay late at night for more people of the Manor to be awake?"Good evening, Astoria."Astoria closed her robe and crossed her arms. "Evening, Mr. Malfoy."Lucius got within her space and looked into her eyes, or she felt like it was her soul he was trying to see. "Out for a late-night walk through these historic halls?"Wow, this was uncomfortable. "Erm—no. I was just saying goodnight to Draco. It would appear he found himself at the bottom of a whisky bottle, so I put him to bed."Lucius hummed and kept inching closer to the young witch. His eyes lowered to her left hand and he picked it up. "No ring?"Astoria never expected an engagement ring from Draco due to their circumstances, but it would have been nice to have a radiant cut diamond sit upon her tiny finger.She shook her head and tried to take her hand away until Lucius gripped. "My son should have granted you an obscenely large rock to sit on this lovely hand." Lucius placed a kiss upon the top of her hand and before she could respond Narcissa walked in from the darkness."Evening. What are we doing out of bed?" Narcissa said as she took place next to her husband.Astoria felt more awkward than ever. All she wanted to do was run back to her room, down a sleeping draught and fall into a dreamless sleep. She was not expecting so many speed bumps on the way back to her bedroom."As I was telling Lucius- ""She was just going to bed, Cissa." Lucius interjected.Astoria gave a soft, awkward looking, smile and shrugged her shoulders. Narcissa extended her hand and squeezed her shoulder. Astoria took note of the gorgeous black diamond ring that sat upon Narcissa's finger. It was large rock that had tiny diamonds lining the band. Quite the ring for an aristocratic woman."That is a gorgeous ring, Mrs—Narcissa."Narcissa's expression fell, and she shoved her hand into her robe pocket. "Erm—ahh-yes. Family heirloom. Off to bed with you." Narcissa said with a warm smile.Astoria felt it odd that she shoved her hand into her pocket. She merely was admiring her mother-in-law's ring, what was the harm? Something about that black diamond drew her interest, and she hoped one day to have a ring just like it. Still, something about that rock seemed familiar to her. Almost like Astoria had seen it or maybe worn it somewhere?When Astoria awoke the next morning, she was greeted with the Daily Prophet sitting by her bed, followed by a steaming cup of tea. She propped herself up to begin reading through different articles. Most of them were about Quidditch scores, or a large column that Rita Skeeter wrote about some wizard or witch. But one section of the paper caught Astoria's interest.The search continues for who is responsible for starting the fire at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After the battle concluded, many students shared testimonies about whom the woman may be but nothing is confirmed. You-Know-Who is still at large, and nothing can be done at this time when it concerns his followers. On another note, the British Ministry of Magic is working on sorting through an official arrest of young wizard, Draco L. Malfoy for the assassination of Albus Dumbledore. The late wizard died in 1997 but no witnesses came forward until an anonymous tip was sent in. The whereabouts of the Malfoy boy are unknown currently.Damnit. Astoria knew that the Ministry was going to come after her or Draco sometime. Her fiancé killed the most powerful, and respected wizard on the planet, did she expect him not to face consequences? Astoria felt a sense of relief that not one of the students could identify her as the fire-starter. Even though the castle was in the process of rebuilding, it was one of the lowest moments of her life when she burned down such a culturally filled castle.After Astoria finished putting herself together she took note of a tiny box that was waiting for her on her dresser. Inside the box was the black diamond ring that Narcissa was wearing the night prior. It was a gorgeous stone, and there was a tiny note under the box.A stone fit for the future lady of the house.It was not signed, but Astoria figured it was from Draco, it had to be. This was her engagement ring or perhaps his apology for how he treated her last night? But why would he give her, his mother's ring? Why not buy a new one, Merlin knows this family is not hurting for gold?Astoria placed the ring upon her finger, and it was instantly comfortable. It made her hands look elegant, and that she was ready to be the next mistress of Malfoy Manor. But still, something about this ring felt familiar to her. The longer it sat on her finger the more she wanted to look at it. Sometimes she felt it trying to speak to her, but she paid no mind to that notion. Even in the Wizarding World, jewelry did not speak to witches.Breakfast was a feast prepared by the tiny house elves, and Astoria was bewildered by the amount of food these creatures could whip up. She was sipping on her tea and flipping through a nearby book when Draco joined the table, holding his head."Tikki! I require a hangover potion." Draco spat at the elf. "Right away, sir!" The tiny creature vanished and Astoria found herself chuckling. "What's got you babbling?"Astoria lit herself a morning cigarette and held it between her lips. Incendio. "Did we indulge in a little much last night, darling?"Draco waved the smoke away with a fury. "Must you smoke that blasted thing in here!"Astoria flicked it into the ashtray. "It is ten in the morning. Must you irritate me so early?"Draco rolled his eyes and began to eat his eggs. A few moments later Lucius and Narcissa joined the table. They greeted the children and began to sip on tea and coffee. Astoria felt this was the perfect time to thank her fiancé for her ring, when there are witnesses and if he tries to call her names, Narcissa will shove him out a window."Hmm—I do thank you Draco for the wonderful ring you gave me for our engagement. It definitely suits the situation."Draco did not bother looking up. "I have given you nothing."If Draco had not gifted her the ring, then who?"Erm—may I see the ring, dear?" Narcissa said while holding out her hand. Astoria obliged and placed her hand in Narcissa's palm. Then the older witch's face turned upside down, and she shot a look at Lucius."Lucius, a word, if you please."Lucius rose from his seat and followed his wife out of the room. Astoria could hear the tension filled conversation from the next room. Draco still looked unamused and desperately wanted his hangover potion."That was MY ring, Lucius! How dare you give HER that ring! I want it back." Narcissa spat."Cissa, think of the girl. Now, she needed a ring, she adored yours, and since she is to be our daughter, I feel it is appropriate to shower her with everything it means to be a Malfoy. That includes a fine engagement ring."Astoria heard Narcissa stomp up the stairs and Lucius joined the breakfast table once more. She began to fiddle with the black diamond that sat upon her finger. Astoria was certain by now that Narcissa did not want to part with this ring for a valuable reason, but what was it? To the untrained eye this ring was simply an elegant rock, but perhaps to someone who studied magic that could be hidden within objects it would be much more. It was only a month before the wedding was to commence. So far, Astoria was not making any leeway with Draco about winning his love back, and everything about the wedding was out of Astoria's hands. She felt as if she was riding on a broomstick but someone else was deciding where she was going.
  
    Chapter Text
    1999Astoria sat upon the barstool twiddling the cocktail sword in her martini and patiently waited for Lilla to arrive. She found her eyes wandering around the bar and watching the muggles drink their cocktails, smoke their cigarettes, and have mindless chatter. Since the Ministry of Magic was on the look-out for followers of the Dark Lord, Astoria was forced to congregate in Muggle parts of Britain."Hey doll." Lilla said as she placed a peck on her best friends' cheek.Astoria caught her friend up on everything that was happening in her life. The ordeal with Draco and her "engagement" ring was concerning. Astoria felt odd that Lucius gifted his wife's ring to her. Draco should have been the one to offer a ring to his fiancé, not her soon-to-be father-in-law."That is fucking weird, Tori. Lucius always gave me the creeps. I mean, I know Antonin is no peach to be around but at least he does not send shivers down one's spine." Lilla proceeded to take sips from her cocktail, and she grabbed Astoria's hand to regard her black diamond ring. Astoria noticed her friend's facial expression twist into something other than appreciation. She proceeded to question her friend about her expression."Oh-erm—nothing. It's just that—there is something off about this ring. Call me mental but, it is almost as if this ring has a mind of its own."Astoria snatched her hand away and lit up a cigarette. "Lill, come on. That is completely mental. Even with magic there is no such thing as an inanimate object having its own mind."Lilla took her friend's hand. "You know what I mean. Just be careful. I don't sense any dark magic in it. I merely feel a pull from it y'know?"Astoria pondered at the thought behind the magic of her ring. Perhaps Lucius put a protection charm over it for Astoria's safety. Merlin knows that all men from the council are responsible for Astoria's safety. Especially, Lucius since he is to be her father-in-law sooner rather than later.As Astoria took puffs from her cigarette, she noticed Lilla shifting in her seat. She always knew when something was on Lilla's mind, this girl was never quiet for more than two minutes at a time."Care for a smoke? Looks as if you need one." Astoria said while holding out her cigarette pouch.Lilla shook her head and continued to sip on her cocktail. Now Astoria knew something was wrong, this girl has never refused a cigarette in her life."Okay Dubois, what is with you? You look dreadful."Lilla chuckled and rolled her eyes. "Well, Greengrass, you always know when I have shit on my mind."Astoria nudged her friend. What the hell was wrong with this woman? What could possibly be wrong in her life to make her look as awful as she did? Lilla was married to one of the most powerful men in the Wizarding World and she had more money than a young wife needed."Can you spit it the fuck out- ""I am fucking pregnant." Lilla spat. She then proceeded to down her cocktail in one gulp and ordered another.Astonishment struck Astoria's face and she was speechless. Lilla was the same age as Astoria and was too young to be a mother. Plus, Lilla was never the children type of woman. Never desired the aspiration for a family. Astoria wonders how Lilla even got pregnant with all the contraceptive charms that are invented. Astoria grabbed hold of Lilla's hand as she watched tears begin to roll down her cheeks. Astoria realized that this pregnancy was not a happy occurrence."Does Antonin know?" Lilla shook her head and continued to gulp her martini. "He will never know. I don't want the little bastard."Astoria always desired to have a family one day. She hoped it would be with Draco. To have a son that shared his father's grey, stormy eyes or a daughter that had a sharp tongue like her mother. Astoria began to envision herself on the edge of a beach watching Draco teaching their child to wade in the water. Perhaps one day that dream would be a reality. Only if and until Draco gets over his obsession with mudblood's."I can't have this kid. I do not want a kid with Antonin. I-I—this is all too much. It is bad enough that at eighteen I was married but now this, pregnant at nineteen is ludicrous." Lilla began to hyperventilate.Astoria gripped Lilla's hand and gave her a firm squeeze. She was going to be the shoulder for Lilla to lean on. Whatever she wanted in life, she was going to get."There are places we can go in the Muggle world. Muggle doctors who can perform... such procedures."Lilla nodded and she hugged her friend. Astoria looked down at her best friend's wedding ring and thought back to the day Lilla Dubois was wed.Astoria regarded her childhood best friend in her wedding dress, and she was the epidemy of glamour. Lilla was dressed in a sleeveless ballgown, and she was going to be wed to Antonin Dolohov. Not the ideal marriage Lilla was expecting, but it was a marriage of high stature."Nervous?"Lilla nodded as she lit up a cigarette and began to take deep inhales. Typical Lilla to be a bride who smokes a cigarette in her wedding gown. Astoria snatched the cigarette away and began taking puffs herself. Astoria's nerves were almost as knotted as her best friends."Heard anything from that prick, Malfoy?"Astoria rolled her eyes and shook her head. She had not seen Draco since he kissed her goodbye at the Battle of Hogwarts. The bastard of a man led her on and proceeded to leave her behind."I got nothing but a crummy letter explaining basically, how he made a mistake with me, and by him attempting to rekindle "us" he discovered his true love for another." Astoria said as she flicked the cigarette onto the ashtray."That little bitch. I am sorry, doll. Even though he is quite desirable to look at, his heart is dark."Astoria placed a necklace around her friend's throat and hugged her from the back. "Not as dark as mine." Wink.Lilla chuckled and nodded. "Do you think you will ever see him again?"Astoria pondered whether she should tell Lilla about the possibility of an arranged marriage with Draco. At the last meeting with her Master, Lord Voldemort, he was discussing her permanent placement in the High Council. The Dark Lord requires women to be married to council members to earn a position. Astoria never stopped loving Draco and she knew if they were able to talk, he would fall for her as he once did."Let's just say, very soon he will receive the news of his life." Astoria side with a chuckle and Lilla's face turned sinister. Lilla knew her best friend all too well to know when she is plotting something. "I always want to thank you, Lill. For allowing me to stay with you all this time. If you had not taken me in, then I would have been forced to return to Spinner's End. A dreadful place that was."Lilla put her hand over her friends' mouth and shushed her. "You know I will always be here for you. I know you were expecting to be spending these days with Malfoy, but I was glad I could be there for you."The best friends hugged it out and it was time for Lilla to get married. By the end of the day, she was to become Mrs. Antonin Dolohov.As the two childhood friends were departing, Lilla took her friends hand and had a disconcerting look on her face. Lilla lifted her sleeve to reveal her Dark Mark was moving around her arm. She was being summoned. Astoria hugged her friend and reassured her that everything, regarding her unwanted pregnancy, was going to be fine.It had been about a week since Astoria's visit with her friend, and she was reading a book in the library of the Manor when her fiancé approached her. Shocking he was coming to talk with her at all."What is it dear? Care to join me?" Astoria said without taking her eyes off her current read."The seamstress is in your chambers to fit you for a dress. Go." Draco spat.Astoria swung her legs off the couch and stood abruptly in front of her cranky fiancé. She stood inches from his body and could feel the tension build. How this man was gorgeous, but also complicated."Oh, how I love your perky tone." Astoria as winked at him.The female seamstress took her measurements with an enchanted measuring tape and began scribbling Astoria's desired colors, and neckline for her evening dress. This was going to be a dress that would shock the council and the guests. Narcissa and Lucius are hosting an engagement soiree for Draco and Astoria. Quite a fancy occasion, and was strictly under the radar, due to the Ministry poking its head around in attempts to find Draco. Astoria flicked her wand to start the nearby record player. The song, Nights in White Satin, began to play. Astoria always had a knack for 1960s and 1970s music.As Astoria was standing with pins at her sides and the seamstress poking and prodding her, she felt a pair of wonderous eyes regarding her from behind her door."And how I love you. Yes, I love you. Oh, how I love you." The Moody Blues continued to sing, and Astoria began to hum. An abundance of truth that lived within one simple song."Depuis combien de temps êtes-vous ensemble avec votre fiancé?" The seamstress spoke strictly French, so, lucky for Astoria she spoke French flawlessly, as did her fiancé."Draco et moi serions ensemble presque trois ans, mais c'est compliqué." Draco and I would be together almost three years, but it is complicated.The seamstress took out a pin and looked up at Astoria with curious eyes. It was pretty apparent what she was thinking, "Complicated? Why would an engagement be complicated if two people love each other?" When it comes to Astoria and Draco, complicated was not a sufficient enough word for their relationship. Perhaps, controlled was a better term."Lonely man cries for love and has none.New mother picks up and suckles her son.""Es-tu heureux?" The seamstress asked with a concerning look on her face. Astoria looked at her in the eyes and then looked at her hand that sat with the diamond ring. "Are you happy?"Was she happy? Why would the seamstress ask if she was happy? Of course, she was happy. Astoria was getting everything she ever wanted. A wonderful husband, a beautiful house, a title, and endless time to paint to her heart's desire. She would paint more often, if she found the strength to put her feelings on a canvas. What even was happiness anymore?Dinner with the Malfoy's was always an interesting time of day. The house elves would prepare more food than needed, and the conversation was more than bland. Draco would not even look at Astoria anymore. In many ways it was disheartening, but hopefully, one day, everything will change."Are you ready for the party tomorrow night, Astoria?" Narcissa inquired while reaching for her wine glass.Astoria nodded and smiled. "Indeed. I had my fitting today and I am sure my dress is going to be extravagant."Draco chuckled and gripped his whisky glass. Astoria tried to shrug off the rudeness, but she could not help herself. Soon this Manor was going to be in her command, and she was going to need to start acting like the lady of the house."Something amusing?" Astoria spat.Draco finally looked up and into her eyes. "Do you honestly believe people are going to fall for this silly notion? It's all a fucking lie." Draco stormed off onto the terrace without allowing Astoria to comeback at him.She followed him outside and gripped onto his arm attempting to swing him about. "When are you going to be decent towards me? I am tired of this."Draco chuckled and gripped onto the ledge. "This. What we were. Is over, Astoria." Draco said without looking her in the eyes. "It—it is never going to be as it was. Don't you get it?"Astoria turned him around and she saw how broken he looked. This man was at war with himself. Astoria could see how he was trying to decide what he wanted, but something was pulling on his mind."Let me in. Please. Fucking look me in the eye and tell me you feel nothing for me." Astoria spat.Draco held onto both her arms with a firm grip. He kept attempting to speak but coward down. His breathing became scarce, and she noticed his body beginning to shake. "Tell me you love her." Astoria whispered.Draco remained silent. "SAY IT!" Astoria exclaimed in his face. She kept repeating herself until Draco shoved her against the nearby wall and regret instantly came across his face. Astoria almost slapped him in the face for pushing her, but instead she ran. Ran as fast as she could through the gardens and rose bushes. Tears rolled down her face. She was tired of not being loved or wanted. All she ever wanted was someone to look at her and tell her she was everything to them. She was never enough for any man.Astoria ran in front of a nearby fountain and collapsed in front of it. She cried into her arms and let all her mental guards down. Astoria felt her heart strings unraveling and felt as if she could not do this anymore.Astoria raised her head and lifted her wand into the air. "Periculum!" She yelled and she watched the red sparks fly from her wand. Her mother told her at a young age, anytime she felt like falling apart casts sparks in the air with all your might and let the feelings go. But it was not working, she whaled her voice into the air, and tears kept streaming. Until she heard footsteps approaching."Are you alright?" Draco said hesitantly."Go away." Astoria said pathetically while wiping her face."Fine, if that's what you wish.""Merlin, I can't fuckin' stand you." Astoria spat.Draco chuckled and he turned around slowly. "Is that so?" Astoria stood abruptly and shoved the pale blond on the chest causing him to lose his footing slightly. "YES! You do not even have the balls to admit to me that you love that mudblood! You coward!"Draco took Astoria by the neck and caused her to silence. His eyes filled with rage and his upper lip quivering. "You want to kill me? Do it. You want me gone? Fucking end me." Astoria croaked out. With every word she spoke she felt his grip tightening.Maybe this would be the end. Maybe he would kill her, right here in the rose gardens. Then her life would be over, and his life could begin, without her."You have no fucking idea who or what I am." Draco whispered.Astoria laughed, as best she could, and gripped onto his hand that was on her. "I know you better than you know yourself, Draco Malfoy."Draco released his grip and Astoria gasped for air. "You—you are the boy who always wanted to please Daddy, but you fell in love with a mudblood whore. Then you attempted to cover up your feelings with me. As you called me, Slytherin's princess. Then uh-oh-- in that process you fell in love with this whore. Now you're fucked." Astoria sat back onto the ledge of the fountain and Draco began pacing."All I know is I feel disgusted by you. That is what I feel when I think of you, but when I fucking look at you—I—I ---- fucking Merlin—" Draco swept over to Astoria, grabbed her face and smashed his lips upon hers.It was apparent within the kiss that there was a connection between these two. A history, a passion or hunger. Astoria nipped the bottom of his lip causing him to firm his grip around her cheeks. Astoria raked her hands through his hair and pulled ever so slightly.Draco picked up Astoria and carried her over to a nearby bench. He stopped for a moment and looked down at the woman beneath him. Astoria saw in his eyes, that he was conflicted, but it was love that brought him back down to her. Astoria straddled Draco on his lap and arched herself into him. His hands grasped her hips, and she began to roll back and forth."Tell me to stop." He murmured while breaking the kiss.Astoria took a breath and grasped his neck. "Don't ever stop." Smashing her lips back on his.Draco began to unzip the back of her evening dress and kissed along her shoulders. Astoria felt euphoric, almost as if she were dreaming. Something switched between this complicated couple, but the chemistry was apparent.How can two people who seem to despise one another have so much passion between them?Draco planted kisses along her collarbone, and she tiled her head back to intake the amount of tingle from each kiss. Everything she felt for this man once before was flooding back to her. The memories from the Opera, the masquerade and all the times in sixth year. These two people were drawn to one another like the serpent and the apple.Astoria lifted her head back and cupped Draco's face. "Never stop." She whispered.Draco looked her in the eyes and his head fell. "I can't promise that." He took a deep breath. "My head is fogged, but as long as I keep looking at you, I feel this." Draco connected their lips and pulled her close.Astoria was not going to ask anymore questions and was going to enjoy the moment. As Astoria's dress fell beneath her chest, she began to unbutton his black dress shirt. Draco took out his wand and apparated them back into the Manor, in his bedroom.Astoria took a few steps back and began to slowly let her dress fall to the ground. She stood in front of him braless, and only wearing laced underwear. Draco looked at his fiancé and walked toward her slowly. He cupped her left breast and connected their lips for a passionate kiss."Please." Astoria whispered. "Make love to me."Draco picked up the tiny witch and set her down gently onto the bed. His sheets felt like expensive silk, and they slid up against her skin. Astoria blossomed for this man like a flower, to quote F. Scott Fitzgerald. Astoria straddled her future husband and left a trail of kisses with every button she undid. Draco sat up and tossed his shirt across the room and her eyes trailed to his left forearm. The Dark Mark was a permanent scar. Astoria closed her eyes and felt instant guilt It was her fault he had the Dark Mark. Draco tipped her chin up and pecked her lips."Scars make us who we are." He murmured. The pale wizard had Astoria stand and he pushed her hair out of the way to expose the back of her neck. Astoria almost never wore her hair up due to her runic imprint. Draco ran his thumb over the rune, and placed a hot kiss on it, causing Astoria to let out a gasp.Draco bent her over the nearby dresser and smacked her ass, quite hard. "You make me want to fucking scream sometimes." He spat.Astoria let out a breathy laugh and threw her head back allowing her hair to whip. "How else am I supposed to keep you interested?"Draco gripped her hair and pulled her head back, he whispered into her ear. "I'll make you scream right here. You'll be begging for mercy.""I dare you." She challenged.Draco bent her over once more and slid her laced panties to the ground. He slid two fingers inside of her and she let out a low groan. Astoria heard his belt buckle and his trousers hit the floor. He was going to fuck her, tonight, against this dresser. How she craved him for so long.Without warning, Draco forced himself inside of her. Almost simultaneously, the couple moaned and with every pump Draco made, Astoria let out loud moans. He gripped her head with intent, and she was savoring every moment.Astoria knew the entire Manor could hear them, but in this moment, who gives a damn? Draco and Astoria were going to be husband and wife, which means they were going to need to reconnect somehow. Sex is the best possible option.Draco slid out of her, spun her around and picked her up. He held her against the wall and fucked her, without regret. Astoria cupped his face and kissed his lips passionately. She moaned in his ear and nipped at the lobe. Astoria could feel the sweat coming off his back as she raked her fingers nails against his skin.She felt her body beginning to rise, and her climax was going to commence. With every pump this man made, Astoria felt herself unravel at his grasp.Astoria cupped his face once more and glared into his eyes. "Cum for me." She demanded.A few seconds later she felt Draco relieve himself within her, and her insides got warm. He set her down gently and Astoria tried desperately to catch her breath.Draco paced over to the nearby whisky bottle that laid on the fireplace mantle and he took a swig. His face fell as he looked at Astoria. She waved her wand to conjure a black slipped dress on herself and she walked over to him. "What is it? Tell me." Draco gripped onto the bottle and took another swig.He looked at Astoria with disheartening eyes and spoke lowly. "I think someone got inside my head. Every 'happy' memory we have is tainted by a hate."Astoria took a few paces back and began to fiddle with the diamond ring that sat upon her finger. Why was he just telling her this now?
  
    Chapter Text
    1999Astoria found herself walking up to the Shrieking Shack and she could feel in her heart that this was the right move. She could not live her life tethered to a Dark Lord. The Runic imprint needed to be reversed. Astoria felt grateful in her heart that Hermione would offer her skill to help reverse the magic.As Astoria ascended up the creaking stairs, she saw the bushy haired witch preparing for the procedure. "Sit." Hermione ordered as she pulled out a nearby chair. "Keep your head up and face me. Do you have the erm—object?" Hermione inquired.Astoria nodded and reached into her pocket. She pulled out the black diamond ring and Draco's eyes bulged from his skull.Astoria's awoke suddenly from her night slumber and she found herself hyperventilating. When she does not take her Sleeping Draught potion, she has strange dreams. Astoria held onto her chest, but then looked down at the black diamond ring that nuzzled her left ring finger. It was the same ring from the dream, but the dream could not have been based off true events, could it? Astoria shook her head and swung her legs off the side of the bed. It was nearly four in the morning.The young witch was in no condition to go back to sleep anytime soon so she ascended down the grand staircase to fix herself some tea. However, when she walked into the kitchen, she noticed another sleepless woman standing before her."Narcissa? Can't sleep?" Astoria said as she reached for the nearby kettle.Narcissa let out a pathetic yawn and shook her head. "Not a wink, dear."Astoria continued to pour herself some Chamomile, it was, in her opinion, the perfect sleep inducer. As she sat next to her future mother-in-law, she could not help but feel awkward tension. Narcissa remained silent, and Astoria was almost afraid to spark conversation. Astoria always felt Narcissa had mixed feelings towards her. What was it about this woman that gave her an uneasy feeling in her bones?"Would you like to hear something funny?" Astoria inquired while taking a sip."I would not mind." Narcissa quipped.Astoria let out a low laugh and held up her left hand. She then explained her dream in detail and continued to chuckle through it. Astoria needed to tell someone about the dream and hoped Narcissa would ease her mind.Narcissa's face fell, and she shifted in her seat. Astoria expected her to chuckle, and it tell her how mental it was for an inanimate object to hold such power, but the old witch did not say a peep."Right—erm.... well, I do feel that Chamomile taking effect." Lies. "I think I will shuffle off to bed now." Astoria said as she started to leave the room until Narcissa grabbed onto her hand causing her head to snap around."Are you sure you are ready to marry my son, Astoria?" Narcissa said with a confrontational tone. "Draco does not seem to be taking to your affections anymore, darling. Maybe it is time to let him go."Let him go. A phrase that often ran through Astoria's mind. This woman had not realized how many times Astoria tried to let him go, and he would always come back. Astoria knew that her and Draco were bonded, and there was no way she was allowing him to slip away, again. This young witch felt it every time he touched her, and every time they had sex. The passion was exquisite, and Astoria had never felt such a chemical reaction in her life.Astoria furrowed her brows and snatched her hand away. "Of course, I am. Draco and I may have a complicated history, but I love him, and I know he loves me still. Plus, this is what the Dark Lord wishes..." Lies. Astoria stopped in her tracks and spoke with her back facing Narcissa. "I will never let him go."Narcissa stood abruptly and was inches from Astoria's face. "Your marriage will end in ashes."Astoria bowed her head and scoffed. "That is if someone lights it on fire.""Goodnight, Miss. Greengrass." Narcissa spat back."Pleasant dreams, Mrs. Malfoy."Astoria stomped back up to her room and slammed the door. How dare that old woman presume such a horrid fortune for her future marriage. Narcissa may be Draco's mother, but Draco is Astoria's fiancé. The future lady of Malfoy Manor should be receiving nothing but respect. It was quite apparent that Narcissa was not a rooting fan for her son's future marriage. That tiny detail was not going to stand in Astoria's way, she gets what she wants, even if that means removing impending factors. Your marriage will end in ashes. Who is going to light the match?The night of the engagement party was about to commence. People of high stature, and important members of the Dark Lord's council will be in attendance. Even a few faces Astoria was not fond of would be attending the soirée. The dress the seamstress made for her was utterly breathtaking. Astoria stood in a midnight blue strapless, mermaid dress with a sweetheart neckline. She pinned up her hair in the back and placed an invisibility charm on her Runic Imprint. The young witch was placing her black diamond engagement ring back on her finger, when a tiny house elf appeared in her room to summon her to the foyer. Astoria stood abruptly and glided out of her room. As she stood at the top of the stairs and peered down, she saw the man she loved most in the world, even if he was a dick. The witch felt her heart beating out of her chest. It was the moment she started to get flashbacks of being in the Slytherin common room and ascending down the stairs to attend the Masquerade Ball with Theodore Nott. Except this time, this was her party to celebrate her future union with Draco Malfoy.Ever since Draco revealed to her that he believed someone had been tampering with his thoughts involving Astoria, the couple had not spoken since last night. Draco stood at the foot of the stairs and held out his arm. A cold expression laid upon his face.Astoria slid her arm under his and he guided her towards the foyer to greet her guests. Narcissa stood with Lucius and could barely make eye contact with Astoria. She had said enough to her this morning, Narcissa was the last person Astoria wanted to converse with. Astoria began scanning the room for her best friend, Lilla. Where the hell was, she? It was Astoria's engagement party, and her best friend was missing.Draco and Astoria stood, silent, greeting numerous guests of the council. Nagini strode in with a smile splashed across her cheek. Astoria kept a close relationship with Nagini ever since her time in Italy. These two women shared something special, and Astoria gave Nagini something she could never repay, her life."Evening Astoria, Draco, are we enjoying the party?" Nagini inquired while hugging Astoria."It's interesting." Draco said sounding bored."I am having a great time, thank you Nagini. I trust all is well with my Master?"Nagini nodded lowly with a shy smile. "The plans for the future are looking bright. We do hope once you are married, you will join us once more at council meetings. The Dark Lord has certainly missed your presence these past couple months- ""That is apparently my doing. Extend my sincerest apologies to his Lord." Draco spat.Nagini cocked her head for a few moments and pursed her lips. Draco was a difficult man to understand, and even Nagini could not fathom why Astoria decided to marry him. But we all we have our desires."Well, erm—I am erm—going to stroll around for a while. I will speak with you two later."Before Astoria could register another thought she heard an annoying voice coming from the crowd."Astoria! How are you doing!" Pansy exclaimed while having her arm linked with Theo Nott. It would appear these two were a couple.Astoria had not spoken to Pansy since their sixth year, when she left school and Pansy hated her guts for "stealing" Draco away from her."Pansy. I did not know you would be here. Welcome." Astoria said in a bored tone, then her eyes shifted to Theo with a friendly smile. "Theo. I've missed you." Theo gave her a hug and followed by a tight embrace."Hi little devil. I see you were finally able to snag this chap, huh?" Theo said while nudging Draco.Astoria had explained to Theo why she cursed him the night of the battle. Theo was one of the best men she knew, and he never held grudges. Theo knew Draco better than anyone and understood why Astoria did what she did."Trapped is more of an appropriate term, Nott." Draco spat.Astoria squeezed Draco's arm and rolled her eyes. Couldn't this man be cordial for just one night?"Astoria, mind if I steal you for a moment?" Pansy inquired."Not at all. Let's go out on the terrace. Excuse us, boys." Astoria exclaimed. She wondered what this pug-faced woman could want to converse about. Maybe she wanted to go for round two in a fight?"Astoria I--erm—where do begin?" Pansy said while fiddling with her hands.Astoria rolled her eyes and lit up a cigarette. How the sweet relaxation of tobacco filled her lungs, and put her into a state of Zen, for small amounts of time."I wanted to apologize to you." Pansy said while placing a hand on Astoria's arm. Astoria's eyes looked confused and was in a state of disbelief. Was Pansy Parkinson saying sorry?"For what exactly?""Uhm—erm well—""For calling me a whore and believing that I 'stole' Draco from you, when he was not yours to be stolen?"Pansy began to shift in embarrassment and her eyes began to water. How pathetic."Astoria, please believe me when I say I was a stupid child. Things have changed since then—"Astoria stood abruptly and blew smoke in her face. "Is it because you are afraid of me, Parkinson? Afraid of what I might do to you if you continued to get on my bad side?"Pansy shook her head and wiped her moist cheeks. "Please. All I am asking for is a chance to redeem myself. Theo gave me a chance, and now we are engaged." Pansy exclaimed.Theo was getting married to Pansy Parkinson. For a moment Astoria's heart ached for Lilla, who she knew for a fact, fancied Theo Nott. Even though Lilla was married, she did not marry for love."Congratulations to you both." Astoria said as she took puffs from her cigarette. She wanted to dismiss Pansy, never speak to her again, but something in her bones was telling her to forgive this creature of a woman. If Astoria were to continue her friendship with Theo, Pansy was going to be in the picture. She might as well forgive but never forget. Astoria held out her cigarette for Pansy to take a drag, as a peace offering.Pansy's face lit up and she accepted the smoke gladly. The two "friends" gave an awkward hug and proceeded back into the main ballroom.Theo marched over to the two women and extended his hand to Astoria. "Care for a dance for old times' sake?" Astoria's face lit up and she curtsied foolishly and let Theo push her around the dancefloor.As the two friends danced Theo began to speak lowly to her. "Tell me honestly, whose idea, was it?"Astoria rolled her eyes and smacked her forehead lightly. "Is it quite obvious how miserable he looks?"Theo shrugged and then smiled. "Malfoy was always a tough one to crack. Each chapters of his life are locked with a different key.""I was ordered to get married by my Master. Draco was the most appealing choice. Everything is complicated, Theo. I—I—don't know." Astoria's eyes began to water, and Theo peered down at her. "Look at me, Tori. Whether that chap knows it or not, you are the best thing to have happened to him."In this moment Astoria made eye contact with Draco and his eyes shot to the outside terrace. The young wizard looked down, and back up, then proceeded to almost sprint outside. Astoria furrowed her brows and told Theo about what she just saw."Go." Theo ordered.Astoria picked up her dress and proceeded to follow the pale blond outside. She looked all around, where the hell did, he go? Just as she was about to give up, Astoria heard talking coming from deep within the gardens. She shuffled her dress and walked cautiously to follow the noise. The voices were becoming more apparent with every small step. Draco was talking with a female witch, and the voice sounded familiar, but she could not place it, yet.Astoria peered around the corner bush to find Draco pacing back and forth in front of Hermione Granger. The mudblood witch that was in possession of Draco's heart, and who single handedly, ruined her life.It was almost as if something took over her body, her blood began to boil every second she was looking at the bushy haired witch. Astoria clutched her wand at her side and made her presence known."You whore. Get the fuck out of my house!" Astoria exclaimed while pointing her wand at Hermione.Draco eye's bulged from his head and he immediately leaped in front of Hermione. The brown haired with looked confused, and she gripped onto Draco's arm. Draco eye's were burning through Astoria's body, she could feel at any moment he would hex her into oblivion if she tried shooting a curse at the mudblood. However, at this moment, given the history, the consequences were not looking so awful. If Astoria casted the killing curse just once at that mudblood then her worries would be over. Hermione would be dead, and Draco would be free of her."Astoria, wait, please. I need you to listen to me!" Hermione exclaimed. Astoria ignored her and continued to march toward her, with anger in her heart. Kill her. End her. End this."I am done listening. I want you OUT!" Astoria roared. He loves her, not you. Kill her."Greengrass, you will not touch her." Draco exclaimed while holding his wand at his fiancé.Who was going to cast first?"Merlin, both of you are MENTAL! Astoria, do you realize the Ministry is after Draco? If you make your marriage anymore apparent, then they will find him, and take him to trial!" Hermione cried out.Astoria, not backing down, was trying to digest what the witch was saying to her. She knew that the Ministry was looking for Draco, but she had no idea that the announcement of their marriage could put him at risk."No, it is not true. Back away from him. You ruined us once, and I will not let it happen again!" Astoria said breathlessly as tears rolled down her cheeks. She ruined him. She stole him away. End her.Hermione then looked at Draco, and back at Astoria. "She is still under the spell, isn't she?" Hermione inquired.Draco remained silent, and kept his wand drawn at the blond witch. "It does not matter. All I---I know is that I hate her. She is a French whore. Whore. Whore!" Draco bellowed out.Astoria felt her heart ache, and her eyes begin to pool. This was the man she had sex with the night prior and he was calling her a French whore. Astoria found herself dumbfounded. How could someone be so heartless to mess with Draco's mind so vividly?Hermione knocked him on the side of the head and looked into his eyes. "What the devil is the matter with you, Malfoy? Why do you hate her? You adore her."Draco shook his head and began to shake. Astoria noticed his level of discomfort, and then her eyes met Hermione's. "Somebody tampered with his mind?"Astoria nodded and began to wipe the tears away. Why was Hermione trying to aid them? Wasn't she the enemy? The wicked witch that swept in and stole her one source of happiness?"Astoria...listen to me..." Hermione said while throwing her hands in the air and inching forward. "You are confused...it is time for you to wake up from this spell..."Astoria bowed her head and did not want to hear such nonsense. What spell was she under? She felt perfectly fine, it was Hermione who was the enemy. Her fault. Her fault."I am not confused! You are the devil in my dreams! You stole his heart!"Hermione shook her head. "No, Astoria. You stole his heart from me. It's okay... now do you see that diamond ring you're wearing?" Hermione said while pointing at her finger.Astoria peered down at the luxurious black diamond ring and began to nod slowly. What was this girl hinting at? Hermione tried to walk past Draco, but he shoved her back. "Malfoy, let me pass. I know you hate her but if you do not let me help her, she will kill me." Hermione said while cupping Draco's face.She is the enemy. End her. Kill her.Astoria marched forward with her wand drawn and her tears rolling down her face. Hermione was able to pull out her wand and take a few paces behind Draco. Without another word Hermione casted a stunner onto Malfoy and he collapsed.Astoria ran to his side and clutched him firmly. Astoria needed help, she needed to get this bitch out. She lifted her wand into the air and casted the first spell that came to her mind. "MORSMORDRE!"Hermione eye's bulged from her head and terror came across her face when she saw the green skull appear in the sky. Astoria called for the Dark Lord's council."NO!" Hermione leapt forward and tackled Astoria to the ground, and Astoria let go her wand. The two girls began rolling along the ground and Hermione grabbed hold of Astoria's left hand."LET GO OF ME!" Astoria bellowed."TIME TO REALIZE THE TRUTH!" Hermione roared and she rammed Astoria's left hand onto the stone of the fountain. The black diamond ring shattered to pieces, and the magic inside the ring exploded, causing the two witches to be pushed backwards abruptly.Astoria's mind began to unfold, and new memories were beginning to flash before her eyes. The missing puzzle pieces were beginning to be put back into place."I—I lo-love him, Astoria." Hermione said breathlessly while the tears rolled down her cheeks.Astoria was flat on her back when the memories were placing themselves back into the files of her mind. It was beautiful and painless.Hermione shook her head and peered over at Draco. "The extraction magic was killing you. It made your heart stop. I am not sure if the spell was too difficult or—"Astoria began to realize the truth of her dream, for it was not a dream, but a locked-up memory."They are coming, and they will kill you if they find out you had something to do with this. Take Granger and GO!" Snape roared.Astoria felt herself smile and she turned her head to see an unconscious Hermione, and finally the last memory containing the ring flashed before her eyes."Draco is drawn to you, it is force by love, my dear Astoria." Narcissa interjected sharply."Who is going to be entrusted with the memories?" Narcissa inquired."I do not know we have not gotten that far."Narcissa ripped off her glove and pulled off a black diamond ring that rested on her middle finger. She held it out and gave it to Astoria."Place the memories in this ring. Before the procedure starts give it to Draco, and he will know with whom it belongs. I will keep the truth safe, please let me do this." Narcissa pleaded.Astoria eyes shot back open and before she knew it she was being picked up by a familiar face. When her vision became unblurry once more, it was Theo Nott. Astoria rose her head to see Hermione being placed in magical binding manacles. The power of the memories taking over Astoria's mind made her weak, and unable to speak. She needed to save Hermione now that she knew the truth."Whe—ree is Drrr-aco?" Astoria croaked.Theo picked up the tiny witch and began carrying her back into the Manor. "Malfoy will be fine. He will be revived in no time."Astoria got placed onto a nearby couch and was handed a firewhisky. Alcohol thanks gods.Everything was making sense again. Astoria felt the runic imprint on the back of her neck, and realized the magic was different. She knew it felt different but never knew the reason. The runic imprint was transformed into a rune of dark magic protection."Where is Her—the mudblood?" Astoria said while looking around.Theo handed Astoria another whisky and began to whisper. "I assume she is being taken into the Dark Lord's custody."Astoria felt her chest begin to get heavy and her heart ache. This was her fault that Hermione got captured because she summoned the Death Eaters."I am going up to my room, can you send Draco?"Astoria lit up a cigarette and waited for the blond wizard. After what felt like hours, he finally apparated into her room."What have you---" Draco begun to say but Astoria cut him off."We need to save Granger." Astoria spat.
  
    Chapter Text
    1999Astoria found herself pacing around her bedroom. All her missing memories came charging back into her brain like an express train. She could not help but feel guilty for everything she had done, simply because she was under the impression Draco broke her heart. Astoria could not fathom how powerful the feeling of scorn felt and how much she wanted vengeance on Hermione Granger before the ring was smashed.Granger was never the witch who stole away Draco's heart, but it was Astoria who stole his heart from Granger. Astoria was the beast who yanked Malfoy away from his first love. But was it Astoria's fault if she did not know she was committing such an act?Astoria decided to put up her occlumency walls to block out the heartbreaking acts she committed while under the memory charm. The killing of Ron Weasley. Burning down Hogwarts school, and nearly cursing Hermione before Draco's eyes. Astoria needed to stay focused and having those memory fog her judgment was not wise. Occlumency walls up.Astoria knew that Granger was in the Dark Lord's custody, but she needed plausible reason to have an audience with her. However, Granger was second on Astoria's list. Recovering Draco's mind was on the first. She could not handle having Draco scorn at her at breakfast anymore, and she wanted the man she once fell in love with back in her clutches.The young witch dove down into her trunk and sorted through her personal belongings. Some time ago Astoria wrote to her sister, who was a healer, and asked her for a vial of Veritaserum. Veritaserum was known as truth serum, and one drop in a witch's drink would suffice.Found it. Astoria clutched the vial in her hands and stuffed it into her pockets. She needed information, and the one person who had an ocean of secrets was the current mistress of the house, Narcissa. Astoria peered outside and it was nearly daybreak. She quickly realized she had not barely slept since she had her memories retrieved days before. Tomorrow Astoria would drop some Veritaserum into Narcissa's tea and see what information Mother Malfoy has to offer.The following afternoon Astoria was sitting in the formal living room, smoking a cigarette, and waiting for the perfect time to have tea with her future mother-in-law.Just as the young witch was about to flick the last of her cigarette bud into the nearby ashtray, the runic imprint on the back of her neck began to tingle. A council meeting was being called.Astoria quickly rose to her feet and her fiancé, and future father-in-law met her in the foyer. Lucius held out his hand and smirked. "No need for you during this meeting, my dear. His Lord wishes that you continue to rest your pretty head. The Dark Lord is concerned for your well-being ever since that filthy mudblood attacked you in the gardens." Astoria scoffed and then her eyes fixated on Draco's, she then met his grey, gorgeous, trustful eyes. How his eyes alone told the hardship of his life."Stay here. Mother is out on the terrace about to have her afternoon tea. Try not to upset her." Draco spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and nodded. Both men trotted into the transport room and flooed off to wherever the council meeting was being held, probably at the Dolohov Estate.Astoria tried to owl Lilla several times, but she had received no answer. She felt worried ever since Lilla conveyed her unwanted pregnancy to her. Astoria worried that Lilla would try to harm herself and try to end the pregnancy herself. Astoria had found a place in muggle London to perform the surgery, under the Wizarding radar, without Antonin discovering. Astoria merely needed Lilla to answer her letters and her prayers of the pregnancy being abolished would be granted.Astoria felt for the Veritaserum in her pocket and took a deep breath. Here we go. Astoria strolled out onto the back terrace and was met with Narcissa's cold, hard, gaze. This woman was never pleased to see Astoria anymore."Mind if I join you?" Astoria inquired.Narcissa shrugged and pushed over a cup of tea. Astoria took a seat and cleared her throat. She needed to find a way to slip the serum into Narcissa's tea and fast. She thought about the different options she had. A diversion? Telling her to look one way and pour the serum in quickly? Slapping the woman in the face and before she has a chance to turn back around? All pliable options. She just needed to choose one-POP. "Mistress Malfoy. A letter has arrived for you from Spinner's End." The small elf placed the letter on the table. Narcissa opened it quickly and excused herself to read it in privet. It must be from Severus Snape, he lived in Spinner's End, and Astoria had spent some time there during the summer of 1997. It was almost a miracle the old witch was excusing herself, perfect opportunity for Astoria to poison er---coax her tea.Astoria noticed Narcissa reading the letter intently, from a distance, and within a few seconds the Veritaserum was in the old witch's tea. The young witch waited patiently for Narcissa's return, and every moment she waited, the more nervous she felt.Narcissa finally sat back down with Astoria and the two sat in silence for a few more minutes. Why was this woman not drinking her tea?"Well, I think I am going to take care of a few matters. See you soon- "Narcissa began to say before being screamed at by Astoria."NO! Erm—" Astoria shouted bluntly causing her quickly re-shut her mouth."Pardon me?" Narcissa exclaimed annoyed.Astoria needed a reason for this woman to stay and drink more tea. Anything!"I erm—mean. We have not had our afternoon tea. Please, sit and join me. I will reheat yours. I hate to... sip alone." Astoria flicked her wand and Narcissa's tea was instantly hot. Narcissa looked at her inquisitive and Astoria tried her best to look at normal as possible but screaming at someone to not leave seems oddly enough suspicious."If you insist. One more cup." Narcissa said slowly while raising the cup to her lips. Astoria felt odd watching this woman take sips of her tea. She wondered how long it would take for the Veritaserum to take effect. Should she simply just start asking questions? Let us start with a personal one."Narcissa, did you marry for love?" Astoria asked quietly.Narcissa chuckled and seemed to have diarrhea of the truth. She began to explain how her family forced her into marriage at a young age and was prohibited to marry someone she truly loved. Then explained how Draco came into the world, at first unwanted, but now deliriously loved. The Veritaserum was working..."Why did you insist on being the keeper of my memories the night of the opera?"Narcissa scoffed and began to drink her tea once more. Yes, drink more of the serum."I was never planning on returning your lost memories. I had hoped to keep your memories concealed until you were dead." Narcissa said plainly."Why would I die?"Narcissa leaned in and smirked. "I was planning on having you removed, permanently, sweetie. I will never allow you to marry my son."Astoria felt disgusted and wanted to hex this woman into the next reality. She felt betrayed by a "loyal" follower of her Master. Everybody on the Dark Lord's council was responsible for the safety of Astoria. Just how did Narcissa plan on removing Astoria for good? Surely someone was going to notice..."You are bad blood and are no good for my son. I do not care if he loves you, I will spend every waking moment meddling with his mind for him to witness the truth!" Narcissa exclaimed while slamming the cup back onto the saucer.The truth. What exactly was the truth?"Go on." Astoria said lowly."You are property of the Dark Lord. I will never allow you to bare my grandchildren."Astoria leaned in and smiled. "Was it you who messed with Draco's feelings towards me?"Narcissa smirked and nodded. "He will never love you."Astoria needed to discover how to break the spell that was over the man she loved. The young witch asked Narcissa how to break the spell and the older woman scoffed. "You need to ask the man who casted the spell." The old witch leaned in. "Severus." She muttered. "You will never break the spell. One day Draco will understand that you are nothing but a pathetic slave to the evilest wizard that walks the Earth. You are as filthy as a mudblood." Narcissa spat.Astoria stood abruptly and pointed her wand at the old witch. She had the truth and needed nothing more from this woman."I have news for you, Mother Malfoy." Astoria got close to Narcissa's face and smirked. "When your son touches me, kisses me, and runs his fingers down the sides of my body, your bloody spell subsides. Our love cannot be dwindled by a petty charm." Astoria stood back and pointed her wand, yet again, at Narcissa. "Obliviate." She muttered. Narcissa would have no memory of the recent happenings and would not recall that Astoria asked her many questions.Astoria rushed inside and needed to break the spell that was holding over Draco, she needed to get in touch with Severus, quick. Astoria ran into the transport fireplace, clutched onto some Floo powder, and shouted the phrase, "SPINNER'S END!"Green flames filled the fireplace, and the empty space around her body. Seconds later the young witch slid through a musty fireplace that had yet to be dusted and was greeted by a cold tone of voice."Dropping by Miss. Greengrass?" Severus spat lowly.Astoria gathered herself up and brushed off the ash from the fireplace. She stood on her two feet and tried desperately to gather her thoughts. She needed the potion to cure Draco's mind but how would she go about demanding such a thing from Snape?"I—erm—I—I need..." She stuttered.Snape, looking dreadfully bored, scoffed and crossed his arms. "What is it you need, stupid girl?"Astoria huffed and charged toward him. "I NEED THE POTION" She bellowed out abruptly and quickly fell into embarrassment. Astoria was never going to get it now. Fucking Merlin."A potion? For what exactly?" Severus stated lowly and slowly."Narcissa told me everything." She stated confidently while broadening her chest. Astoria needed to stand her ground, she was not intimated, that much.Severus chuckled and planted himself in the nearby armchair. He reached for the cup of tea by the side table and sipped slowly. The silence was deafening. Suddenly, Severus peered up at Astoria and stood abruptly. He began to walk around her until he moved her hair from the back of her neck. Silence.The older wizard now stood in front of her and grabbed hold of her left hand, where the black diamond ring appeared no more. His eyes met hers."You regained your memories?" His eyes burned through hers while keeping a cold expression.Astoria tried to yank her hand away, but Severus kept a tight grip. "Y-yes I did. I know everything."Severus scoffed and threw her hand from his clutch. "You know nothing, stupid girl."Astoria reached for her wand and pointed it. "I AM NOT STUPID!"Severus stood in front of the wand and put up his hands. He chuckled lowly. "If you are willing to make idiotic decisions for the sake of the Malfoy boy, that makes you stupid." Severus walked toward the pointed wand once more. "Do it. Your hands are drenched with blood. What will it matter if you add mine to them?"The thoughts of everything Astoria had done began to run through her mind. Snape was trying to break her occlumency walls, he knew that she was shutting out all murders she had committed. Astoria tried to keep the walls stable, but Snape's voiceless magic was strong. Before Astoria could realize Snape pointed his wand at her head and muttered the spell, "Legilimens!"Astoria's head flew back and her occlumency walls came crashing down on her like a pile of bricks.Astoria looked into the man's eyes, held her wand tight, and took a deep inhale. "Avada Kedavra."Astoria's first kill came crashing down on her walls.Without speaking Astoria strode over and impaled the blade into Ron's back causing him to fall to the ground. Draco ran up behind Astoria and pulled her back and he watched Hermione cradle the lifeless corpse of Ronald Weasley in her arms."ENOUGH!" Astoria lunged Snape from her mind and tried her hardest to repair her occlumency walls."You are a murderer. Do you think you deserve happiness?" Snape spat.Astoria scoffed. "Then why save me? You knew I was half dead when you found me at the Shrieking Shack. WHY NOT LET ME DIE?" She yelled.Snape did not make eye contact with Astoria and kept his head low. "I have duties to the Dark Lord. He wants you alive, always."Astoria began to grip onto the scalp of her hair and heave. "Professor, I need that potion. I have no one left. Please. I need him back." Tears began to spill from her eyes and her chest began to get heavier with every stuttered breath.Snape finally met her eyes and took a large inhale. "Would you kill for love?" Severus inquired lowly keeping his hands clasped. Astoria scoffed before she opened her mouth to reveal the naked truth."Love has destroyed me into the woman who stands before you. Broken, tethered, and utterly infatuated with a man who suffers the same fate as I." She said with a sorrowful chuckle. Astoria threw her hands in the air and charged toward Snape until she was inches from his face. Her hands shaken, her forehead perspiring and her eyes teared. "The real bloody question is how many more do I need to kill for the man I love?" Astoria then stomped her shoes across the floor. She reached into her pocket to pull out her cigarette packet, she lit up the bud and took a long inhale."You chose to murder, Miss. Greengrass. Draco killed because your life was in danger- ""I never wanted this-any of this. I have never had any choices neither!" She interjected while pointing her cigarette towards the dark wizard."Ahh—and what about Weasley? Who forced you to kill a young wizard with his entire life ahead of him? Was someone pointing a wand at you and commanding you?" Astoria lowered her head and began to wipe the tears that were flowing down her cheeks."No—I he—Granger and Draco—I" She began to croak out."You killed for no reason." Snape strutted towards her and peered down. "You deserve nothing." He spat.Astoria backed into the wall and rested her head on it. Emotions were coming down on her like a tsunami. The regret, guilt, and non-existent scorn."I ask for the potion that breaks the spell on Draco. I demand it." She spat back."Absolutely not. Narcissa and I had a bargain." Snape sat back in his chair and clasped his hands together. "Trust me girl, you do not want to marry that boy. If you do, it will not end well."Astoria shook her head and stood in front of him with rigid posture. "I do not care if I marry him anymore. I merely want him to come back to me. When his feelings of me are fixed then he is free to decide."Snape shook his head and began to walk out of the drawing room. "No. I will not break the bargain."Astoria grabbed hold of Snape's arm and clutched it tight. "What was the bloody deal? Gold? I have a vault full. It is all yours if you wish- ""I have no use for gold." Snape spat. "I do not think you understand how much Narcissa despises you.""I don't care! Just-please! Professor-!"Snape broke free of her clutch and forced her into the armchair by lunging at her. "The bargain was you, you stupid girl!"Astoria shook her head and cursed under breath. "That--that is mental. I do not understand- "Snape snorted and began to pace. "Do you not understand the reason why I saved you that day in the Shrieking Shack? I made this bloody deal to keep you alive."Astoria shook her head and stomped on her cigarette. "I do not care if I live anymore. All I want is—""Want has no meaning anymore. It was your father's dying wish that you remain alive." Snape admitted lowly."My father? When or how did you know my father?"Snape ran his hand through his jet-black hair and took a few deep breaths. "Your father was my childhood best friend. After he married your mother, we fell out of touch, per say, and when he was introduced to the Dark Lord's council we reunited. Your father was trying to take you away from the Dark Lord, so I was ordered to remove him."Astoria felt her heart begin to ache. It was almost a year since her father's passing. The day her father died there was an explosion at the British Ministry of Magic, in the department where Thomas worked. Astoria was told that her father died due to the bombing, but it was a lie. Her mother fled to France to mourn her husbands passing and Astoria had not seen her since."Thomas told me at any cost to keep you alive, and I intend to keep that promise. Narcissa was planning on destroying you in private during the war, I implored her not too. That is when she made this deal with me. Narcissa is disgusted that Draco is infatuated with you, so she ordered me to tweak his emotions towards you." Snape paused and met Astoria's eyes."Tweak?" Astoria whispered."The inside of his heart still beats for you, there is a wall that blocks his true feelings in his mind. The best way to break the wall is through physical contact."Astoria's eyes bulged and a small smile spread across her cheeks. "Of course. We—we—ermm—and I could feel everything we once shared."Astoria knew in her heart that Draco could never truly hate her. That part rang through when they had sex some time ago. Every time his hands touched her body, and with every pulsating kiss they shared, euphoria bloomed."I still need the potion. I cannot try and break the spell by simply trying to shag him a few times over. Granger is imprisoned and all his thoughts are on her." Astoria challenged. She was not leaving without something.Snape pinched his temple and laughed. "If Narcissa realizes that the spell is broken she will not hesitate to curse you to death. Even if that means upsetting the Dark Lord."Astoria stood up abruptly and spoke fast. "I can tell Draco to act repulsed by me when we are in public. It should not be hard, I mean, he is who he is. Please, I need this." Astoria implored.Snape waved his wand and above his fireplace sprung open a secret potion stash. There was everything from an abundance of Floo Powder to some Amortentia. Looking at the Amortentia brought Astoria back to the beginning of her sixth year, in Slughorn's class. When she was (basically) a normal schoolgirl. Snape was fiddling around with some of his concoctions until he mixed some green liquid with some purple and a small puff of smoke expelled from the jar.Snape held it in front of Astoria's face and gave her a cold stare, when she tried to grab it, he pulled it back. Astoria scoffed. "Professor. I am beyond bloody tired of people messing with my memories, and Draco's mind. This all ends now if you let it." She held out her hand.Snape waited a few seconds and carefully placed the small vial in her hand. "Are you positive you know what you are doing?"Astoria pondered for a few moments and chuckled lowly. "Absolutely not, but I am learning as I go."
  
    Chapter Text
    1999It had been weeks since Astoria had last seen Lilla. No answer of her letters, and no unexpectant visitations from the girl who lived her life without a care in the world. Astoria was worried and knew she needed to take action into her own hands. The blond witch trotted down into the transporting fireplace, held the Floo powder in her hand and bellowed out the words, "Dolohov Estate!" The green flames surrounded her and before she knew it, she slid out of the fireplace at Lilla's estate. The house was quiet, almost too quiet. Astoria gathered herself, dusted off the ash, and waited for someone to notice her arrival, or even hear a sound. Nothing.Astoria walked up the hallway of the estate and noticed the many photographs of her and Lilla while at the Beauxbaton Academy of Magic. The days before life set in. She walked a tad further to the island in the kitchen and noticed a glittered envelope. Astoria picked up the envelope to notice this was her wedding invitation. Astoria sighed and felt the pure irony of the situation.All Astoria truly ever wanted in life was to be loved by someone unconditionally and be with them until death was at her doorstep. Astoria thought about if the potion did not work and Draco did not regain his feelings for her, then what will become of her life? Being forcibly married to a man who truly desires another? Isn't the point of love putting your partner before yourself?Astoria clutched onto the invitation and opened the envelope slowly. It was the first time she was seeing a speck of evidence of her own wedding; she was not involved in the planning at all, due to Narcissa trying her hardest at dismantling the affair.Astoria's eyes began to pool slightly as a small smile came across her face.~Save the Date~
Please join us in celebrating the union ofDraco Lucius Malfoy&
Astoria Danielle GreengrassThe wedding will commence on September 23rd, at sunset. The ceremony and reception are to be held at Malfoy Manor.How lovely her wedding was going to be at Malfoy Manor. Astoria had hoped to one day have a destination wedding, like in the Highlands of Scotland or the countryside of France. Some of Astoria's fondest childhood memories consist of her running through fields of wildflowers in Lyon, France while attending the academy. Lilla and Antonin probably had no use for the invitation to her wedding, and Merlin knows when Astoria will be able to get her hands on this keepsake. She took the invitation and shoved it into her purse. As she started to turn around a figure from behind her startled her by speaking causing her to jolt."Miss. Greengrass?" Dolohov said while extending his hand to grasp onto Astoria's tightly. "What do I owe the pleasure of this most unexpectant visit?"Astoria tried to pull her hand back, but his grasp was firm, and his gaze was unnerving. "I came to see Lilla. Where is she?"Dolohov chuckled and put her arm around Astoria. "Ahhh—my darling Lilliana is upstairs... erm—composing herself. I will fetch her." Astoria released herself from his arm and watched the dark wizard trot up the staircase."Astoria?" Lilla said quietly from the top of the stairs.Astoria wanted to run up the stairs and hug her best friend, but the energy felt different. Lilla's face was oddly different, and her body carried the baby of what looked like a full-term baby. Astoria's eyes bulged from her head and did not understand what she was seeing. It had only been weeks since Lilla told her of her unwanted pregnancy, now Astoria was seeing her almost ready to bust."Lilla, erm—how—what?" Astoria said while placing her hand on Lilla's stomach. Dolohov stood behind his wife, with his hands clutched at her shoulders."Isn't it wonderful? We are pleased to be of service to the Dark Lord." Antonin said while placing a soft kiss upon Lilla's face.Lilla's face seemed cheerful, but at the same time lifeless. Almost as if she were trapped inside her own body. Lilla's eyes told the story of her feelings, and Astoria knew something had been done to her best friend.Astoria knew there were ways of fast tracking a pregnancy in the Wizarding world. Potions, charms, but mainly curses of dark magic, that dealt with life and death."How are you feeling?" Astoria inquired while trying to look past Lilla's eyes. A small crack of a smile spread across Lilla's face."I am splendid. It is my miracle." Lilla held onto her stomach and smiled, oddly. "The Dark Lord will take care of him. I am elated to have been chosen."Astoria furrowed her brows and tried to make sense of the situation. Finally, Antonin chuckled and then showed himself out of the room.Astoria held onto Lilla's cheeks and made her meet her eyes. "What the hell is going on? What happen to you not wanting this pregnancy?"Lilla laughed lowly and kept holding her stomach. "Ohhh—I was very naughty." Lilla leaned into whisper. "There was lots of blood until Antonin found me. Then suddenly poof I felt at ease and so excited for my journey." Lilla laughed lowly. "Uhm—Astoria given my condition... Antonin and I are unable to attend the wedding."Astoria clutched onto her friend's hand and gave her a shy smile. It is not as if it was the wedding Astoria imagined so perhaps not having Lilla there will feel more like a formality than a wedding?Astoria felt as if she were looking at a ghost of a woman she once knew. The body of Lilla existed, but her soul was different. There was nothing Astoria could do for her friend now, any day the baby would arrive, and Lilla would become a mother?A small tear left Astoria's left eye and it slid down her cheek. She grabbed onto her best friend and held her tight. "I love you, Lilla. Be safe."Lilla laughed lowly, again, and spoke oddly. "Love you too! Come back anytime!" Lilla released herself and began to stroll along the banters of the stairs while humming to herself.Astoria bolted into the transporting fireplace until she felt the grasp of a man pull her."Let me go!" Astoria whaled out.Antonin clutched her close. "Your Master calls." Antonin shoved Astoria onto a nearby spell book and she was immediately transported into the lair of Voldemort. The spell book must have been a hidden portkey. She planted onto the floor and felt disheveled until she was greeted by Nagini and Bellatrix LeStrange."Hello dearie." Bellatrix said while standing over her. Astoria gathered herself and found her footing."Come. Master calls." Nagini said while taking her hand.Astoria felt her chest beginning to get heavy, and her breathing quickening with every step. She had her memories back and now more than ever needed to conceal them. Astoria tried her best to put up her Occlumency walls, but the anxiety was building with every step.Astoria was led into a tiny room that had stale air and had hardly any lighting. In the corner of the room sat the infamous Lord Voldemort. Although, he looked frail, and almost ill."Master." Astoria croaked out.Voldemort walked over slowly to Astoria and regarded her, while showing a sickening smile. The dark wizard ran his fingers through the ends of her hair, but Astoria did not dare move a muscle."My darling girl. How I have missed you." Voldemort said lowly while tracing a finger along her jawline.Astoria wanted to look away, grit her teeth and bare the touch she was feeling, but she knew if she turned away, someone she loved would be punished. Voldemort's hand grasped onto Astoria's and he massaged his fingertips with his hand."How can I be of service, my Lord?" She said shakily while quivering her upper lip.Voldemort finally released his touch and walked backward to sit in a nearby armchair. "What do you know of the mudblood that rots in the dungeon of Malfoy Manor?"Astoria shifted in her stance and crossed her arms tightly. "Not much. We—we were classmates." Astoria eyes scanned the room to lock eyes on anything except the dark wizard that sat before her.Voldemort clutched onto his wand and chuckled. "I think you are lying, my dear."Astoria's heart nearly stopped and sweat was beginning to form at the top of her head. She needed to keep her cool about Granger."I would never lie to you, my Lord." She stated coldly.Voldemort stood abruptly and waved his wand in the air to show a cloud that pictured Hermione in her cell. She was clutching onto the bars and blood was dripping from both of her wrists. Granger's curly bushy hair now straightened by sweat and blood, her clothes ripped. Astoria felt awful in this moment, that Hermione's imprisonment was her doing."How does seeing that make you feel?"Astoria rolled her eyes and tried her best to lie. "I feel nothing." Lie.In that moment Bellatrix lunged forward and got in Astoria's face. Astoria could smell the rot of her breath and saw every black hair curl that lined the dark witch's face. "SHE'S LYING!"Voldemort slowly pushed Bellatrix aside and gripped onto Astoria's face. "I will just have to see for myself." Voldemort pointed his wand at Astoria's head and muttered the word legilimens.Astoria held onto her head as she felt the power of the magic force through her mind. Every memory was being sorted through. Her Occlumency walls failing, everything she worked hard to conceal was being shown.Voldemort plunged through the memories of Romania, the Shrieking Shack, the Opera, and the night in the gardens when Hermione was imprisoned.When the Dark Lord was finished viewing the memories, he pushed himself out of her head, and Astoria fell backwards. Her head felt like a piano had fell on it, and her body felt cold."That mudblood is important to you, I see now. Now, now, my dear you have lied to me. How will we ever build trust again?" Voldemort said while kneeling over Astoria on the floor."I—I—I am sorry." She croaked out. Lies.Voldemort's eyes bulged and he developed an idea. "I want something from you as an apology for your disloyalty to me, Astoria."Astoria closed her eyes and could only imagine what this Dark Wizard could want now. He only had her entire life, the people she loved, and her family. What more was there?"What might that be?" She croaked out.Voldemort smiled and held onto her hand. "You are to be married fairly soon, yes?" Astoria nodded. "The first child you bare, belongs to me."Astoria closed her eyes and tears spilled from them. She had never thought about children, but now she would never have them. How can she put her own child through the same fate as her?"Do we have a deal? I will even allow that mudblood to be harmed no more." Voldemort said while flailing his arms.Astoria sat up and clutched her knee's and began to cry, but very slowly she nodded her head. Voldemort smiled and dismissed her.Astoria felt defeated, weak, and horrid for bargaining her non-existent first child away. Now she will never bare children. Well, she never truly wanted a family anyway. They were messy, time consuming, and—and—in many ways wonderful.Astoria at one point in her life had a glimpse of what her life could turn into if she ever married Draco Malfoy. To wake up next to him every day and bare his children. The feeling of warmth that would come from his body every time she laid her head upon his chest. To feel the press of a kiss on her forehead before he leaves for a work trip. The picture of a "happy" life.Astoria felt the potion that Severus had given her in her pocket and needed to wait for the appropriate time to slip it down his throat. Was there a proper way for forcing liquid down one's throat?Her sore feet paced around her chambers, her mind screaming from everything that happened the hours prior. Astoria felt disgusted with what was happening to Lilla. A girl who despised the thought of being pregnant was suddenly infatuated with the idea. Astoria slammed her fist onto her bed and cried tears of sorrow for her lost friend. What more could she do? Lilla was Antonin's wife, and Astoria no longer had a say in what happened in her friend's life.The look in the young witch's eyes as she looked upon her protruding belly was uneasy. Astoria needed to push Lilla to the back of her mind and think about the, many more, important issues at hand.Voldemort was now aware of who Hermione Granger was and what she did for Astoria.Hermione was trapped in the dungeon of the Manor suffering in anguish.Draco was still under Narcissa's mind spell and was driving himself mad thinking about Granger.Astoria's wedding date was approaching quickly, too quickly. If she cannot administer the potion to Draco before the ceremony, all will be a disaster.Astoria could never give Draco children, if she did, the first one was the property of Lord Voldemort.Astoria scoffed and crossed her arms and paced over to her nearby doors to the balcony. She stepped outside and breathed in the fresh night air. There were only a few problems that were currently at the top of her mind what else could happen-"Stupefy!" Astoria hit the floor suddenly and was knocked out by the stunning spell.  "Rennervate." An unknown voice of a witch spoke sternly.Astoria awoke to feel the coolness of the night air brisk her cheeks, and the tips of her fingers felt the moistness of the grass. When her eyes peaked open two red heads stood before her. She opened her eyes more to notice one was a man and the other a woman. Astoria felt the throbbing pain of her head and cursed under her breath."Where is she? Merlin, where the fuck is she?" The young witch said while slapping Astoria on the left cheek causing her body to slam on the grass.Astoria held her cheek and croaked out some words. "She—she---is---"The red-headed witch gripped onto Astoria's blond hair and made her meet her eyes. Astoria noticed those eyes, and her hair in this moment, she has seen this witch before. On the arm of Harry Potter during the Battle of Hogwarts. It was Ginny Weasley, alongside her brother George."WHERE IS HERMIONE! Merlin, you cunt!" Ginny scolded sternly.Astoria laughed lowly until she heard another female voice, she knew all too well come from behind her."Ginny, enough." The other witch made herself known as she knelt in front of Astoria. "Hello big sissy." Daphne said lowly.Astoria's eyes opened wide, and her hand reached up to touch the face of her little sister, for she was little no more. Daphne was almost a woman, and she was beautiful."Da—Daph?" Astoria croaked as a hot tear fell from her eye."Where is Granger?" Daphne inquired while taking Astoria's hand off her face.Astoria lowered her head and rose to her feet. She peered into the eyes of her sister, then Ginny and finally George. Astoria pointed her head towards the Manor and rose her eyebrows to signify that Hermione was locked inside somewhere."Bring her to us." George spat while pointing his wand at the blond.Astoria laughed and lunged forward at him. "There is nothing that can be done from out here. It is not safe to rescue her now if you're—""Then when." Ginny interjected sharply."I am not sure, just not now." Astoria shook her head and shrugged her shoulders."I cannot let her rot in that Merlin forsaken place. I told my little brother I would look after her and I plan to keep my word." George said pitifully while clutching onto his wand.Astoria felt the pit in her stomach form when thinking about what she had done to Ron, how she murdered him with a blade only to hurt Hermione in the way Astoria thought she hurt her. A messy situation indeed."You will need more people than this to rescue her. Once you step foot into the dungeons the wards will alert the Death Eaters." Astoria stated boldly.Ginny pointed her wand at Astoria. "Why do you care? Huh? You are the one who locked her up. All she ever tried to do was help you!"Astoria nodded and wiped the tears from her cheeks. "Yes—I know that now. My memories were locked away and she helped me regain them." She shook her head. "Three wands are still not enough to rescue her. You'll need more."Daphne stepped forward and put her hand on her sister's arm. "The Order of the Phoenix is almost all dead. I was recruited to help build up the numbers again. I am not sure how we can—"Astoria held onto her sister's cheeks. "Leave it to me. Please allow me to figure out the proper time."George stepped forward and made Astoria meet his eyes. Merlin, this man was tall."You have one day." He spat.Astoria nodded and grabbed onto her little sister to embrace her tightly. "I have missed you."Astoria walked back up the walkway to pass through the doors of the Manor when she saw a figure waiting for her in the doorway. A tall figure with pale skin, and platinum hair."Out for a leisurely stroll, Greengrass?" Draco spat with his brows furrowed.Astoria scoffed and stood inches from his face. She felt the cold hair caress her skin, and the tension form with every second she stood before him. In this moment she wanted to grab the potion and force it down his throat. Then she would imagine him grabbing her face, kissing her lips passionately while carrying her into the gardens to have body trembling sex. However, he was still under Narcissa's blasted spell, but that did not mean Astoria could not push his buttons, per say?"Join me?" She said while biting her bottom lip.Draco tipped the bottom of her chin up to meet his gaze further. Astoria tried to push her body against his before both of his hands pushed against her shoulders and he looked down his shoulder."No." Sigh. "I—I—erm—need to sleep. You irritate me too much." He said irritatingly. Astoria shook it off and kept reminding herself that all of this would end soon. The spell over his mind would be broken and with hope, the man she once fell for is still buried within. George paced around the kitchen of The Burrow in angst. Hermione was imprisoned at Malfoy Manor, and there was not a damn thing he could do about it. George promised Ron that if anything happened to him that he would keep Hermione safe. George knew that Hermione was in love with Ron, and wanted so much to be with him, but some dark wizard killed him.None of the Weasley's ever found out who killed Ron in the woods on the day of the Battle, but it was a horrid mystery. George kept going over and over the plan he had to rescue Granger, but he gave Astoria one day to conjure a plan.That day was today.George sat with his elbows on the table, with a cup of steaming tea between them. Ginny came down the spiral staircase and sighed."If that bitch does not come up with a plan, I am gonna—"George put him his hand and hushed his little sister. He was tired of hearing Ginny's remarks about the situation. As George was putting the tea to his lips, a snowy white owl came bursting into the kitchen with a letter on its beak. Ginny's eyes rushed open, and she snatched the letter from the owl.Ginny furrowed her brows and cursed to herself. George grew impatient and snatched the letter from his sister, but it was not a letter, not really, but a wedding invitation, with a tiny note attached to the back.She is in the dungeons. You are to attend as Lilla and Antonin Dolohov. Brew Polyjuice potion, and I shall send their hair. Keep Daphne safe.A"She wants us to attend her bloody wedding?" Ginny spat while rolling her eyes.George's eyes lit up and hechuckled. "It's brilliant."
  
    Chapter Text
    September 22, 1999The BurrowGeorge ran his fingers through his red hair and kept reading the letter Astoria wrote to him repeatedly. It had been a good amount of time since Hermione had been captured and every day, she was away from The Burrow he felt helpless. He felt as if he were failing Ron by not protecting Hermione and keeping her close. George glanced over to the clock that showed the whereabouts of the Weasley family. What was once a joyful antique, now a painful reminder of the ones he has lost. His twin brother and best friend, Fred during the Battle of Hogwarts. When the remainder of the Weasley’s returned home they noticed that two spoons had fallen off the clock arms. Fred and Ron’s, which indicated their deaths. George did not take the death of his twin lightly, there were many times when he had mindset of closing the joke shop. Too many things reminded him of Fred. However, George knew that Ginny was the one who would be in mourning the longest. She was in love with Harry Potter, and he was killed by Lord Voldemort by the curse of a blade. The Dark Lord could not even take his life in an honorable wizarding way, he took the muggle way out. George knew that Ginny’s heart was in pieces, and probably would never fully recover, until she had her vengeance. Ginny sought revenge on not only Lord Voldemort, but on any Death Eater that crossed her path. George’s train of thought was interrupted when his little sister hastened into the kitchen. “The blonde bitch sent the hairs, and the potion will be ready for us tomorrow.” Ginny placed the hairs of Lilla and Antonin Dolohov into a vial and placed them on a mantle nearby. She huffed out a breath and pushed her hair back. “Dad said the Ministry will intervene as soon as we have Hermione.” George pursed his lips and played with a nearby quill between his fingers. Ginny decided that instead of merely saving Hermione, this would be the perfect time for Draco Malfoy to be brought to justice for his crimes. Ginny also hoped they would catch Astoria in the process and charge her with being in the Death Eater’s council. All George cared about was rescuing Hermione and getting her back home. He would not admit it to himself, but he missed her dearly. The way she would smile when she was getting to the climax of a book or when her expression would fall when something would remind her of Harry or Ron. Although George knew Hermione’s heart once belonged to another, but his identity was unknown, that was, until the night Hermione got captured by the Death Eaters. Ginny had no choice but to come clean to George about where Hermione went, and why. Hermione was still in love with Draco Malfoy. Hermione would not put her life on the line for just any old block. It made George’s head spin on why Hermione would choose to love such a rotten individual, when George knew he could treat her the way she deserved to be. “What’ya think he’ll get charged with? Malfoy?” George inquired. Ginny crossed her arms and shrugged her shoulders. “Well, he killed the most respected Wizard in Britain. I hope the bastard gets a kiss from the dementors.” George ran a finger through his hair and looked up at the clock with the two missing spoons. “This all ends tomorrow.” Malfoy ManorDraco still often thought about how he came to once fall for a girl like Astoria. The Beauxbaton transfer who whored herself around Hogwarts but still seemed to have a meaningful life. How this girl was strangely infuriating but at the same time, alluring. Everything about her was drawing Draco in, her hair, eyes, body, every inkling inside of him was saying to either fuck her senseless or knock her lights out. Draco knew enough that his mind had been tampered with, but in what way? Who would be cruel enough to mess with the mind of a young wizard? Draco had his memories all intact, but his emotions were twisted. He could feel in his bones that there was a chemical imbalance. Every time he walked past the doorway to the dungeons, he could feel Granger’s emotional pull crawling toward him. Draco felt awful about what happened in the gardens, but after he was stunned, he did not remember much. However, he did remember Astoria barking at him about saving Granger, that he could get on board with. Draco grazed his finger over of the archway that led down into the dungeons. The dungeon was protected by blood magic wards, the slightest tampering with the wards would set off the Death Eaters, unless a blood member of the family attempted to pass. Draco was conflicted on whether to walk down those stairs and look Granger in the face. Look into the eyes of a woman he once cared deeply for and tell her he is not there to free her, but he was there for mental satiation. To see her in the weakest state of her life. Would she even want to see him? It is after all, his mansion, his dungeon she is locked inside. She might not take well to company. Draco slowly reached into his suit pocket to take out a tiny blade, he held out his wrist and sliced. Blood dripped onto the steps, the archway and as he took a step, he was able to pass through the wards. As he was about to touch the bars to the dungeon someone grabbed hold of his arm. “Mate, don’t.” Theo said sternly. Draco jilted free of his grasp and scoffed. “What the fuck are you doing here Nott?” Theo proceeded to look up the stairs to notice Astoria stood at the top with her arms crossed. She gave him a nod and left the men alone. “Come. Let’s have a night cap.” Theo said while trying to guide Draco away from the dungeon. Draco sat in front of the fireplace with Theo continuing to drink fire whisky and starting to regain some feeling back into his mind. Draco always felt the same, empty, frozen in time. He still felt the stinging of the fresh slice that was on his wrist.“Have you seen this?” Theo tossed over the Daily Prophet onto Draco’s lap. “They are going to find you. Now, they know better not to intervene on these grounds but the second you step out—” “It is under control.” Draco spat while throwing it back over to Theo.Theo scoffed and leaned in with both elbows on his knees. “I don’t want to see my best friend locked away for the rest of his life.” Draco shook his head and poured himself another whisky. “Quit your worrying.” Draco rolled up his left sleeve. “You see this?” He said pointing to the Dark Mark. “If those fuckers at the Ministry know what’s good for ‘em they will stay away.” Theo swigged the rest of his whisky and scrunched his face, probably to alleviate the burning sensation. “Pansy and I worried—” “Who gives a shit about Pansy?” Theo rose to his feet and pointed at Draco fiercely. “Watch it Malfoy. Pansy is going to be my wife, show some respect.” Malfoy rose to his feet as well and got inches from Theo’s face and smirked at him. “Jolly good for you. I am soo—ecstatic you found love...” Draco said sarcastically.Was Draco jealous of the love Theo and Pansy had? Draco had shagged Pansy numerous times over the years at Hogwarts and even courted her for a while, he did not think much of the Parkinson girl. She had an adequate face, she was a good lay, but Draco never thought of her as wife material. Even though in the beginning of sixth year the Malfoy and Parkinson parents were attempting to secure a match between Draco and Pansy. However, there was an inconvenience that kept the couple from taking their relationship to the next level.“I thought you did too.” Theo said briefly. “Once upon a time.” Draco snorted and drank more of his whisky, his head started to become lighter, and the words were sliding effortlessly off his tongue. “With whom? Granger? She was a good shag when I was fifteen but—” “I meant Tori; you arse.” Theo spat.Every time someone mentioned Astoria’s name Draco’s eyes went dark, his mind immediately associated her with negativity, but his heart began to leap. Draco could not admit it to himself, but even though every cell in his mind was telling him to scream the word “whore” his heart was telling him to say “mine.” Draco remained silent and kept sipping on his whisky hoping Theo would shift the conversation, but that did not seem like the situation. “You cannot even speak when I mention her.” Theo spat. “Say her name.” Draco kept silent and would not meet Theo’s gaze. He refused to say her name, he could not, not without stating something negative after it. Astoria’s name could not roll of his tongue. “Look at me and say her fucking name. You remember ASTORIA the girl you pined after for years and nearly got yourself killed for? The fucking woman who loves your sorry arse.” Theo bellowed. Say it. Say her name. Whore. Astoria. Whore. “MALFOY!” Theo yelled while knocking the whisky glass from his hand, but Draco made no efforts to move a muscle. He sat on the armchair like a statue. Why could he not move? What was stopping him?Theo grabbed hold of Draco’s chest and forced him to his feet. “If you won’t then I will have to make you.” Theo stormed out of the room, leaving Draco alone by the fire. Where did he go? Draco did not care, all he cared about was having minutes of silence and more time to drink whisky. The whisky alleviated much of the pain he felt in his mind. Draco hoped in this moment Theo left the Manor and dropped the situation, but Draco knows Theo all too well, he was not leaving. Then his mind wandered to Granger, she was locked up below his feet in the dungeons. How could he allow such an atrocity to happen in his own home? Maybe he was a monster. A monster of a man just like his father. One day the karma of everyone he hurt in his life was going to catch up to him, perhaps this was it. He was doomed to marry a woman that he felt hostility towards but also attachment. Draco’s train of thought was derailed by the sounds of struggle from Astoria. She was being led in forcefully by Theo and her hair was disheveled. Draco kept his eyes down and reached for a new whisky glass, pouring himself another. “Theo! Let me go!” Astoria yelled out and tried to yank her arm free. Draco would not meet either of their eyes and kept his gaze focused on the bottom of the whisky glass. Eyes on the ice. Watch the design at the bottom. “Look at her Malfoy.” Theo demanded. Eyes on the liquid that sways from side to side.Draco kept his head lowered and his expression cold. Without another word he heard a hard slap and the yelp of the witch. Theo struck Astoria across what seemed to be the face, but Draco eyes remained on the ice at the bottom of the glass. Was this glass half empty or half full? Half empty. Everything is always partly empty. What would it mean to fill the glass? Love, sacrifice, regret—“Theo enough!” Astoria cried. “Look at HER!” Theo demanded once more.Draco finally peered up slowly to witness quite an interesting picture. His best friend fisting his fiancés head of hair while demanding he notice. Draco knew how the strands of her hair felt through his fingers. The scent of her shampoo that wafted through his nostrils, was Theo having those same thoughts? The ideas were blocked by the strong Occlumency wall Draco worked hard to always keep up, so he finally spat out. “Do with her what you will, she is nothing to me.” Draco placed a leg over his knee and pointing his glass towards the blond. For a moment, Draco’s eyes swayed toward Astoria’s. They were brown, sorrowful, and glistening. His eyes shot back down to the bottom of the half empty whisky glass. Eyes on the ice. Watch the liquid sway. Focus. Theo scoffed and kept his grip on Astoria. “Then you won’t mind if—” He picked her up quickly and Astoria kept thrashing. “---I give her a go would ‘ya, mate?” Theo said coldly while slowly hitching his hand up her skirt and past her inner thigh.Draco faltered for a moment. His head was telling him to trot up the stairs and go to bed, but his feet would not move. Draco had not noticed but his hands were balled into fists, and his expression became more enraged. Eyes on the ice, watch the design between the sways of the--“You won’t mind if I---” Theo lifted his hand from her skirt and reached under shirt.“Draco!” Astoria cried. Draco’s eyes saw red, and he rose to his feet abruptly and knocked Theo onto the ground. Astoria dropped suddenly and she fixed the hem of her skirt. Draco had his hands on Theo’s chest and was pushing him up against the wall. Nott was attempting to hold back Draco’s head and bob his neck. Theo spun around Draco and had him in a head lock. Draco tried to break free, but his arms were not long enough to reach around.“Now, Tori!” Theo demanded while keeping a firm grip on Malfoy’s body.“Come back to me.” She whispered.Astoria poured a mysterious liquid down Draco’s throat that burned like fire whisky on a sober stomach. His eyes beginning to blur, and his mind starting to become lighter. He felt obligated to take down the Occlumency walls, and when he did the feeling was devastatingly wonderful. The feeling of having an open mind and being exposed to emotion.Emotions so many of them came flooding. He saw her face, the face of the blond headed Beauxbaton who managed to lock his heart and open every chapter of his book. Draco’s blurred vision started to see the strands of her blond hair before him, just slowly he lifted his hand to run his fingers through it until he felt as if he was falling. The world before him was turning dark, and his body felt weightless. Astoria caught Draco as he fell backward, and she cradled his head. The potion must have knocked him out. “Do you think it worked, Theo?” Astoria inquired. Theo knelt beside an unconscious Draco and smacked his face slightly. “I believe so. He should be fine. Astoria, I am sorry. You know I would never—” Astoria held her finger over Theo’s mouth and hushed him. “No apologies necessary. It was the only way we were going to get him riled up enough for me to administer the potion. Thank you for helping me.” Theo placed his hand on Astoria’s and smiled. “You know you will always have Pansy and I when you need help.” Astoria smiled and squeezed Theo’s hand firmly. She was eternally grateful for what he did for her tonight. A little manipulation trick never hurt anyone. Now she had to wait for Draco to wake up and see if the spell was broken. She waited for hours, she watched his chest rise and fall with every breath, every reflex or thrash of a limb he would make in his sleep. Astoria slept beside his bed in a nearby armchair and could not tear her eyes away from the man that slept before her. It was the first time she was able to actual regard him in over a year. The way his fingers twitched every few seconds, how his rings glistened in the moonlight. The emerald jewel of the Slytherin ring he wore upon his middle finger. The Malfoy emblem ring he wore upon his other middle finger, both glistened in the light. She noticed how his hair looked disheveled but was also perfect in this setting. A few strands covered his lined forehead. His perfect black eyelashes that nestled his eyelids, how she wished she could see his grey eyes. Draco’s eyes always told his true emotion. When she would look into his eyes, she saw nothing but his naked soul. The soul of a boy who was destined to walk the path of his father’s before he was brought onto the Earth. Astoria laid her elbows on his bedside and prayed for him to wake up and remember the love they once shared. It had been, what felt like eternity since the couple was truly happy with one another. Everyone had a hand in their emotions, mind, and relationship. When was it going to be Draco and Astoria’s relationship with no one else meddling? “Ermm---hmph—” Draco groaned while furrowing his brows. Astoria wiped some leftover tears from under her eyes and kept her stare fixated on Draco. Hoping. Wanting. Please dear Merlin wake up and know me. “Draco?” She whispered. Suddenly, those grey eyes opened, and his gaze turned to hers. Nothing was said, just eyes looking through one another. Astoria felt more anxious in this moment than she had when receiving the Runic Imprint from the Dark Lord. She was nervous that he was going to give her a snide remark and expel her from his presence. Perhaps the potion was a lie and the spell that was casted upon Draco’s memories was permanent. “Astoria.” He croaked out while lifting his hand to graze the side of her cheek. Astoria felt her heart lift, and her chest lighten. The feel of his hand upon her cheek felt like the first time all over again. She slowly raised her hand to cradle his and he squeezed it firmly. “Have you---erm--- do you--?” Astoria attempted to say but all the words kept fusing together, she did not want to mess up. Draco sat up in his bed and smirked. “Do my devastatingly good looks take your breath away?” Astoria let out a low chuckle and she pushed her hair back. “It would appear so, yes.” She said followed by another breathless laugh. Her eyes lowered but Draco tilted her chin up to meet his eyes. “Kiss me.” He demanded. Astoria jumped to her feet and placed both legs over his torso and arched herself into him. Draco put both hands around her face and the couple regarded each other for a soft moment. Astoria felt her tears begin to roll down her cheeks and Draco wiped them away with his thumbs. Astoria placed her forehead to his and she closed her eyes. She took in a deep inhale before she whispered. “Please—please I---” Draco met her eyes once more and his eyes were glossed over. “I love you immensely. You are mine.” Astoria let out a low laugh of relief and she embraced him so tight she felt she was crushing him. Everything that was said, done was in the past for her. Nothing mattered more than this moment. The feeling of his body against hers, the scent of his clothes, the feeling of his warmth wrapped with hers. She feared was might never be able to have the feeling of love again. Astoria looked into his eyes once more and cracked a soft smile. “And I love you. Always. I always have, I never stopped. I—I—” She started to stutter but Draco smashed his lips upon hers and the euphoria struck her. The power of the kiss, the passion that filled the air with every breath.Astoria arched herself onto him and wrapped her arms around him. Draco began to lay kisses around her jawline and down her neck. Each kiss left a light bruise. Astoria raked her hands through his platinum hair and began to grind herself onto him. Then for a moment Draco stopped kissing her and his expression turned into a realization stare. “What is it?” Astoria inquired.A few moments passed and Draco grazed his thumb along the bottom of her lip.“We’re getting married tomorrow.” Draco said flatly.
  
    Chapter Text
    1999
Astoria closed her eyes and nodded to the obvious question, yes, she and Draco would be wed tomorrow.
Astoria knew that arranging the marriage with the Dark Lord was her only chance to have Draco return to her life, but she never stopped to think about the consequences. This marriage was going to be not only Draco and Astoria, but Astoria, Draco, Narcissa, Lucius and Lord Voldemort. It was apparent that no matter what the couple did somebody within the inner circle had their say in their relational status.
“Who did this to me?” He said looking defeated.
Astoria exhaled and felt reluctant to explain to him that it was Narcissa who put the spell on Draco. How could she put a rift in a mother and son bond? But Astoria realized long ago that it was better to tell the truth than to deceive.
She explained to Draco why Narcissa wanted to keep the ring with Astoria’s memories, and what her real motive was, to remove Astoria from the equation, permanently.
Draco closed his eyes and embraced Astoria tightly. She felt his strong arms keep her close, and the scent of his skin was a friendly familiarity.
“I’m sorry. The things I have said to you these past months they were bloody awful. I—I was cursed, my mother, she—she- “
Astoria interjected by connecting their lips and shaking her head softly. “Kiss me and never stop.” She whispered against his lips.
Draco cradled her head and pushed her onto her back. He kissed along her jawline and she felt the heat buildup in her body, the pulsation between her legs beginning to form a heartbeat.
Astoria felt hot tears fall from her eyes and her breathing becoming scarce. The build up of anger, hate, resentment, had created a concrete wall inside of her mind. She is the Greengrass eldest daughter, Voldemort’s follower and now soon to be Draco Malfoy’s wife.
How many directions will Astoria be pulled until she lets her heart decide?
So many thoughts raced through her mind as she was tasting her fiancées lips, coming to the realization of not being the woman who Draco fell in love with weighed heavy upon her heart. She felt herself beginning to falter the kiss and her mind began to race.
Astoria has done things, unspeakable acts while her and Draco were separated. Acts that would turn any heart black, or send any spouse running in the opposite direction.
Astoria held onto Draco’s neck and he ceased his embrace to study her facial expression.
“Why are you tearing?” He asked while brushing his thumb on her cheek.
“I—I—have done horrible things. I fear I am not the girl you once knew---I really am a bitch I—” She began to stutter.
Draco chuckled and rose to his feet to walk across the room. Astoria grabbed hold of her legs to pull them to her chest. What the fuck was funny about the situation? She was pouring her inner most thoughts out and Draco was laughing under his breath. Astoria felt her head cock and she pushed the hair from her face.
“What may I ask is funny?” She spat.
Draco remained silent and slowly picked up one of the nearby candles and pulled out his wand. He flicked it once and Astoria felt her limbs tether to the bed, leaving her immobile.
It was not panic that struck Astoria but curiosity. Something was about to happen and as fucked up as it may seem, it was causing her to become more aroused. The pulsation between her legs began to arise. She felt the silk sheets below her exposed body and the feel of the ropes keeping her in place. The tears on her cheeks quickly dried and as she was about to look up at those smoldering grey eyes her vision went dark, making her other sense enhanced, especially touch. Draco had placed a blindfold over her eyes with what seemed like one of his black ties. The smell of his cologne on the tie filled her nostrils.
She heard Draco walk to the side of the bed and huffed under his breath.
“When are you going to learn…” He removed the sheet covering her abdomen. “…that you are indeed a bitch.” Draco began to run his fingers down her body and tugging at the top of her knickers, causing her to lowly whimper. “However, you are a particular kind of bitch.” The room went still, and Astoria’s senses were becoming more enhanced as she struggled to hear Draco’s whereabouts, until suddenly she felt his tugging at the tethers. “You are a stone-cold bitch that needs to be warmed up.”
Suddenly Astoria felt the sensation of hot candle wax hit the middle of her sternum and instantly harden. The burning sensation was a moment of pain but was intense.
The feeling of a height of a climax that lasts only a second before it fades away, until you have another.
For a moment Astoria forgot where she was. Her and Draco were not in Malfoy Manor, but they were back in Hogwarts. In his old four-poster bed with the window that peered into the depths the Black Lake. The days of innocent, passionate, erotic sex before any responsibilities. However, Astoria’s sense of hearing was heightened, and she snapped herself back to the reality of where she was.
She heard Draco’s footsteps at the lower end of the bed, and he began to graze the inner corners of her thighs with his thumb for a slight teasing sensation. Draco placed his hand at her ankle until he slowly glided up her calf, to the inner part of her thigh until slowly grazing the top of her knickers. The goosebumps began to form the more he glided up her bare legs.
Astoria was coming down off the high of the hot wax that hardened on her chest, and strangely she wanted more, craved more. Fuck. Maybe she was a whore, but only a whore for this man.
“Do it again.” She said breathlessly.
Draco chuckled under his breath and Astoria heard his footsteps stop at the side of the bed. The seconds before the sensation were the longest, she had ever felt in her life.
The seconds before felt almost as tension filled as when she would wait outside Malfoy’s door in the dormitories, and he would sneak her inside for a quick shag before Theo or Blaise returned. Then Astoria felt another erotic, hot, waxy, shock.
Draco poured droplets of hot wax over her exposed nipples and Astoria instantly felt the burning exposure of such a sensitive area. She cocked her head and yelped in pain but also in pleasure. She bit the bottom of her lip and began to squirm. The candle wax began to harden around her nipple, and she felt Draco begin to peel the wax off. Oddly satisfying.
“I think you’re warmed up.” He purred. Draco slowly removed the blindfold, and she met his smoldering grey eyes.
Astoria pulled at her tethers and wanted dearly to touch the man who stood before her. To feel the strong embrace of his arms, the scent of his hair and skin. To rake her hands through his scalp and yank at the roots of his hair. To listen to the low groans that would escape his mouth and travel into the depths of her ear drum. Sounds that would make her body moisten at his touch.
Astoria smirked and began to speak bluntly. “I always knew you had a bondage kink.” Wink.
Draco smirked and cocked his eyebrow. “It’s the only way I can keep you out of trouble anymore. I need to physical bond you to my bed.”
Astoria chuckled lowly and began to arch herself slightly. “Afraid I’ll fly away?” She mocked.
Draco was aware as Astoria was that these two had undeniable chemistry, but the odds were against them. Too many people of their inner circle were trying desperately to sabotage their relationship, and, in many ways, it was working, for a while.
Narcissa did not want her son with a woman who was the Dark Lord’s follower, and his property. Astoria could not blame Narcissa for thinking this way towards her. Who would want their son to marry (one of the most) ruthless women on the planet?
Draco flicked his wand and the tethers that were holding her ankles were released and she was able to move the bottom half of her body freely. Her wrists remained locked in place.
Draco knelt before the bed and grabbed hold of both her knees and squeezed intently. He gave her a striking look that sent a shiver down her spine, almost as intense as feeling hot wax harden on her nipples.
“How many times do I need to repeat myself until you get it through your pretty blonde head?” Draco growled until he began to kiss on the inside of her thighs.
Astoria cocked her head back and she felt her hands begin to grab hold of the silk sheets. Her toes began to curl, and her stomach began to clench. She could feel his mouth coming closer, and closer to the area of a clitoris. Closer. Come closer.
Draco bit the top of her laced knickers and pulled up slightly. Both of his hands reached on both sides of her hips until he slowly pulled them down and tossed them aside.
She felt his head return to its former place, but this time on the exposed skin. Goosebumps began to form on her forearms and her spine began to shiver.
For a moment Astoria opened her eyes to look at the ceiling, and then at the side of the room. She felt bliss in this moment, but also felt dreadful.
Hermione was stilled locked away in the Malfoy Manor dungeons until tomorrow evening, and while Granger is dodging rats, Draco is between Astoria’s legs. The irony is atrocious. Even though Hermione had done nothing but try to help Draco and Astoria, she still felt slight resentment toward the bushy-haired Gryffindor. Hermione pined after Draco for years, and still called for him after Astoria was presumed “dead.”
In many ways Astoria envied Hermione. The golden girl who had her entire life ahead of her, but she was tethered down by the love of a man who craved another, Draco Malfoy. Astoria felt an ache in her heart for the poor girl because Hermione would never again feel the touch of Draco in this state.
Astoria knew in this moment, as she felt Draco’s lips caress the innermost personal corners of herself, they would be forever bonded, never to be severed by any spell or curse. Astoria felt in her inner most core that she would never be separated from this man again, this man who she will love and cherish for the rest of her lively days.
So many thoughts were clouding Astoria’s mind and Draco could sense the shift in her concentration. He lifted his head and bit the inner corner of her thigh causing her to yelp.
“OUCH! Hey!” Astoria eyes darted toward the pale blond between her thighs.
He smirked and kissed the spot he bit. “Get out of your own head.” He kissed more down her thigh until he began to twirl his tongue around her clit. “All will be well tomorrow.” Kiss. “For everyone.”
Draco kept twirling his tongue around her clit and with every movement Astoria’s body was becoming warmer and warmer. The intense wave of pleasure was beginning to riddle her body. The sounds of the room were beginning to deafen, and her focus was becoming heightened. Merlin, how she missed this man’s tongue, and everything else, of course.
Draco stuck two fingers inside of her while keeping the motion of his mouth on her clitoris and Astoria instantly felt herself arch off the bed. The world was beginning to zero in, and her climax was starting to commence. Her blood began to boil, and her abdomen began to flex.
Astoria’s clitoris began to pulse and become sensitive. Draco lifted his head to meet her eyes with a smirk plastered on his face. He placed one last kiss between her legs before he rose back on his feet, with a flick of his wand the tethers seized, and Astoria was free once again.
Draco walked across the room, poured himself some fire whisky and plopped onto a nearby armchair. Astoria placed on a nearby black button up shirt and strode over to the nearby bottle of wine that was kept, conveniently, on the fireplace mantle. No need for a glass, all class was gone, she drank from the bottle. Astoria plopped down on the floor between Draco’s legs and placed her chin upon his knee.
For a moment Astoria’s big brown eyes looked through his tired, heartfelt, crying soul. The heart of a boy who was doomed to walk in his father’s footsteps and was controlled by a mother’s obsessive love. But what is love if it is not obsessive or controlling?
What is the true definition of love if there is no darkness to follow?
Draco polished off his whisky and pinched his temple.
“Is it me that troubles you?” Astoria said with a sarcastic pout.
Draco began to run his fingers through the top of her hair and smiled softly. “I worry about you. If they do catch me.” Sigh.  “The Ministry.” Draco looked down upon his bride and back again at the ablaze fire.
Astoria rose her head and took a seat upon his lap and wrapped her arms around his neck.
“It will never happen. The Ministry is petrified of the Dark Lord, and they know who we are- “Astoria revealed the runic imprint that was given to her by Voldemort on the back of her neck. “-They would not dare touch you unless they want to start another fight.”
Astoria had not often used the power she holds in her pocket regarding the Dark Lord. It was true, Lord Voldemort never (truly) harmed her, but instead cherished her every wake. He adored her, almost obsessively. Perhaps it was time to show the British Ministry of Magic who they are trying to provoke. If Draco marries Astoria, the couple will be under the undying protection of Lord Voldemort.
Draco sighed and furrowed his brows. “I promise we will never be separated again.” He placed a kiss upon her lips, followed by her forehead.
Astoria knew Draco would keep this promise. He was of sound mind, his own mind, and nothing was going to separate their love, this time. Astoria felt the way this man held her in his arms, she was his and he was hers. Not even a spell can sever the bond.
“Perhaps when the chaos with the Ministry has calmed, I can take you away. Just you and I.” Draco purred. “Show you the beauty of Spain or taste terribly made muggle beer in Germany.”
Astoria and Draco chuckled in unison and she nodded softly. Even if their only protection was Dark Magic, it was protection. The Ministry will do everything they can to prevent another battle, and this time they do not have Harry Potter to save them. Who will be their savior? The Wizarding World was spared the agony of a full-blown war two years ago, but Lord Voldemort had every intention of rising to power once more and claiming his spot.
However, it was a secret of the High Council that Lord Voldemort was weakening with every passing day. The abundance of unicorn blood was wearing, and Nagini was no longer under the maledictions curse (thanks to Astoria), and could not transform into a snake, therefor was no longer able to be milked.
Draco nuzzled his head against her chest and kissed her collarbone. “Y’never know maybe in a few years we can have our own kid. A tiny little blond running about the Manor.” He chuckled. “That is if they have not caught me by then.”
Astoria chuckled and met his eyes. “Yes, that is allll --we need is Draco Jr. roaming about these dark halls with his smirked face and bad attitude.” She said playfully. Draco gave her arse a good slap followed by a warm smile.
“I mean it y’know. You are it for me. I want it all with you, someday. As I hold you now that is how I want all my nights to end. With your smart mouth against mine and your gorgeous arse in my hands.” Draco gave her a tight squeeze.
Astoria’s heart swelled with every word he was speaking. She had never heard him talk this openly about his future, their future, together. He was talking about the long-term plans for their relationship, and or marriage. Children…kids. Astoria felt her chest get slightly heavy.
When was she going to tell him she could never give him children? If she did the first one would belong to the Dark Lord?
Astoria was unsure what Voldemort wanted her first child for, but she was sure of one thing. It was not for the same fate as her, she knew that now. Lilla’s pregnancy was sped up due to a potion or charm and she kept stating how she was proud to serve the Dark Lord, but serve him how? How was Lilla pleasing the Dark Lord by having a baby?
All these questions came flooding into her mind with every word Draco was relaying to her about starting a family in the future. How could she break his spirit when she only got him back merely hours prior?
Astoria walked toward the nearby balcony doors and pushed them open. She felt the cool breeze hit her bare skin, and the sun was on the horizon. She took a swig of the wine bottle and set it down. Astoria conjured up a cigarette and began to take long, deep inhales, until she felt strong arms embrace her from behind.
Draco nuzzled his head against her ear causing her to wince and laugh lowly. Draco reached over and grabbed the cigarette from Astoria’s hand, and she immediately tried to retrieve it.
“Come now, hand it over.” She said while holding out her hand.
Draco attempted to hand it back over until he slipped it between his lips and began to take puffs from the cigarette himself.
Astoria stood there with her mouth gaped open and her mind in shock. “Since when do we partake in bad habits?”
Draco shrugged his shoulders and kept taking puffs from the cigarette and spoke with it between his teeth. “There are worst habits.” He said lowly.
Astoria smiled warmly and peered out onto the sunrise, then back at her fiancé. They were going to be okay; the day was going to pass, and they will be husband and wife.
Everything must be okay, he promised they would never separate again. Would Draco Malfoy break a promise?

  1999
It has been days, perhaps weeks since my imprisonment. All I can see is darkness from wall to wall and sometimes the faint light from the top of the staircase. The infection on my arm has not healed from the carving and every time I touch the scab, I feel the pain trickle through my body.Why has no one come for me? Have I been forgotten? Am I lost to the world? Was I presumed dead? I am not dead. I have lived through a war, witnessed countless deaths, and felt my heart break into pieces. I suppose it is my fault, did I expect him to change for me? Everything I did, I did for him. My fault.The only thing I can feel anymore is pain, and even that is becoming comfort. The reason why my wound has not healed is because I keep re-opening it. The warmth of my own blood trickling down my arm is the only warmth I have. Do I regret choosing him over everyone else I ever loved? No, because nobody has ever meant more to me than him, and nobody will ever mean more to him than her. I suppose I sound like a nutter when I talk about him. Nobody has ever seen more of me than he has, not even the man I thought I was once destined for, turns out he was nothing more but a dear friend. I feel my body has weakened from malnutrition and the only person I must talk to is myself, but I suppose it is better that way. Sometimes I enjoy walking around the darkness and seeing how far the walls carry me. I slide my hands down the sides and every so often I will get further and further until I hit a wall.I cannot blame her for calling for help from her own people, I would have done the same if I were confused by my own memories. I was the one who constructed them myself, and I must say, I was quite intricate. I constructed those replacement memories carefully because I wanted her to feel the anguish I felt once. The feeling of having your heart strings snap one by one. The unbearable feeling of looking into those horribly gorgeous grey eyes and feeling nothing but betrayal. The feeling of betrayal in a heart is far more lethal than any physical injury.I have felt my skin being carved by a deranged Death Eater, I have felt magical exhaustion and I have also experienced betrayal. The irony of my betrayal is I am not disgusted by the situation anymore. I once thought that she would be a passing thought for him, and he would find his way back to me.How can you tear someone away from their soulmate? I have never seen a man ruin himself more for a woman than he has for her. And I have never seen a woman travel dark lengths for a man more than her. I just wish that woman would have been me. I was ready to spend my days with him, induct him into the Order and travel the world on his arm. He was going to show me everything the Wizarding World had to offer, but in my isolation, I came to the realization that not everything is as it seems.I will never be her and I will never have a piece of the man I love again, and I still love him endlessly. That is my curse that he left me with. The way his fingers felt tracing my body, the way his lips felt against mine, or the way his eyes scanned the presence of my figure.Maybe I am better off dead and forgotten. My best friends are dead, and the only other man who wanted me was murdered, by my choice. The horrid part of it all was I am mentally unfazed. I witnessed my childhood home burn to the ground by the hand of a mentally scorned Death Eater, who also happen to be the soulmate of my own soulmate. Sheer irony.I guess those muggle novels got one concept correct, just because someone is your soulmate does not mean you are theirs. I knew the consequences of traveling to the Manor to warn him. I took the risk, and I am paying the price. This cell, my isolation, and the endless amounts of time with my thoughts is my punishment. ****I woke up to the sensation of a rat squeaking near my ear, swell. This dungeon is awfully vile and all I desire is a bath. The spells that are designed for this dungeon are interesting. I never feel hungry, and my mind is never allowed to fully slip into insanity. Sometimes I feel myself drifting down the endless hallways of my mind, but something pulls me back to this cold floor.Merlin, I wonder what month it is. I wonder what he is doing or what she is doing. I wonder if the wedding took place yet or if he was captured by the Ministry. Gods, I hope not. If he were captured, I would be devastated, more so because I am spending eternity in a rusty dungeon for no reason. Logically, I want to fight and figure out a way out of this place, but it is unlikely for me because I have no wand and the wards keep out magic.If I am released, I promise I will leave it all behind. I will leave him behind and leave her alone. I will disappear. I will hide away in the Burrow for the rest of my days and spend my time reading books. I just want to feel the sun on my skin again, and the feeling of water cleanse my body. I want to see a person again, have a conversation that does not involve him or her.Merlin, I swear the next time I see them will be my last. I want him to have happiness, and I want her to never look at me again, for it is too painful anymore. Wait, I think I hear something at the top of the stairs. I hear people talking for the first time in months, but I do not recognize the voices.  "'Mione?" I do not know that female's voice, so I will not show myself. I refuse. I do not want to be beaten, carved up, or taken anywhere else. "Hermione... it is us... where are you?" I can make out the silhouette of this female witch, she appears to be pregnant.  "Hermione, it is Ginny and George..."  I am found.  I am Hermione Jean Granger and I have been found. *****White lace, beads that line the spine and a neckline that creases along the chest of the gown. Astoria finds herself pacing around her room, smoking a cigarette to calm her nerves. Keep your shit together. Something is curling inside her stomach and she cannot shake her restless mind. Cracks of thunder were roaring through the sky followed by a downpour rain shower.The blonde witch only has two main focuses. She is hoping the plan with the Weasel's will work like a charm. Astoria runs through a checklist in her mind, she sent them the hairs of Lilla and Antonin for the Polyjuice potion, she instructed Draco to leave a vial of his blood at the top of the staircase so they may pass through the wards. Astoria is biting her nail bed in angst thinking about everything that could possibly go wrong. The Death Eaters could realize that Ginny and George are not the real Dolohov's, and in result, they will be killed, along with Granger. Astoria flicks her cigarette into the ashtray and runs her fingers through her hair. Today is her wedding day. This should be the most special day of her life, but it feels anything but. Today is not only her wedding day, but also much more than that. The silk of the robe hugs her skin, and the lace of her knickers is hugging her hips. Everything is loose but it all feels confined. Astoria looks out onto the terrace and thinks for a moment what would happen if she apparated instantly and fled this occasion. What if she ran into Draco's room and took him with her? Her fingers begin to press the tip of her wand and as she is drawing it—"Astoria?" Knock. "May I come in?" Astoria slips her wand back into her robe and answers politely for Pansy to enter. Astoria notices how beautiful Pansy is looking. Her jet-black hair is pinned up and she is wearing a scarlet red floor length gown. "I came to see if you need help dressing..." Astoria nodded and gave her a warm smile. She slipped off the robe and dipped her feet into the immaculate beauty that was her wedding gown. The lace hugged her body, and the train of the dress felt like it was miles behind her. Astoria regarded herself in the mirror and for a sheer moment she felt like a bride. "You look stunning, Tori." Pansy said while squeezing her hand. "Thank you. Have you seen Draco?" Pansy started to walk across the room to fetch her nearby veil. "I have... he is with Theo. I suppose they are both drinking whisky to calm the nerves." Both witches chuckled and Astoria flicked her wand to complete her hair and makeup. Pansy began to latch the veil into her hair when another knock was at the door."Hello ladies. Pansy if you would not mind, I'd like a word with my daughter in-law." Narcissa said with a sinister smile. Pansy glared over at Astoria and she gave her a warm smile. Pansy embraced her friend and whispered into her ear. "Theo and I are here for you two, no matter what." Astoria nodded and thanked her kindly. Narcissa slammed the door behind Pansy and over toward Astoria. "Come to torment me once more before the ceremony?" Astoria spat while fixing her veil.Narcissa chuckled and crossed her arms. "Now why would I want to torment you? You are going to be family after today—" "Yes, but you do not wish that." Astoria interjected while getting into the old witch's face."You are correct." Narcissa reached over to trace her face and it sent a shiver down Astoria's spine. "But who am I to stand in between true love?" Astoria took a step back and furrowed her brows. "I want you to leave—" Narcissa grabbed hold of Astoria's arm and pulled her in firmly. "Tell me sweetheart when you have your first child will it suffer the same fate as its mother?" Astoria yanked her arm free and felt tears pooling in her eyes. How did this woman know about the deal with the Dark Lord? Would her Master really betray her trust?"You know nothing!" Astoria belted. Narcissa grabbed hold of her once more and smiled. "You sent your own non-existent child to a death sentence, all for a mudblood." Astoria tried to free herself but Narcissa's grip tightened. "I do hope you cooperate better than your dear friend, Lilliana." Astoria eyes widened and she grabbed hold of Narcissa's arms and held her in place. This woman's eyes alone told the story of her character, dark, evil, and ridden with jealousy. "What did he do to Lilla!" Narcissa smirked and snorted. "That stupid girl nearly killed her own child. The Dark Lord felt it prudent to keep her under the Imperious curse... until she...erm...delivered."  Astoria felt like a rock had been dropped into her gut. She should have known something was wrong with her best friend. Lilla never wanted to be a mother, and she certainly never wanted to serve the Dark Lord. But why would the Dark Lord want her child? "Tell me why the Dark Lord desires for her to have a baby so desperately!" Astoria yelled. Narcissa smirked and shrugged her shoulders. Astoria was about to shake her senseless until yet another wizard traipsed into her dressing room. The air went from tension filled to ice cold. "Dear me, what do we have here?" Lucius said while keeping a tight grip on his cane. "Cissa, come. This instant." Lucius said while guiding his wife out of the dressing room.Narcissa furrowed her brows and scurried out of the room. Astoria huffed and crossed her arms; she noticed the sun outside was beginning to lower in the sky. The rain drops were streaming along the glass, and every moment that passed she felt less in control. Lucius strode forward and took Astoria's hand. "Shall we?" Astoria nodded softly and took in a deep inhale. She felt her feet carrying her forward but everything inside of her was telling her to apparate to the nearest Portkey and flee, but she thought of Draco. He would be waiting for her, she could not leave him, then she thought of Hermione. Astoria needed to confirm that the bushy-haired witch escaped. Hermione saved Astoria's life once upon a time, and now it was time for that debt to be repaid. "You look glorious, precious one." Lucius purred against Astoria's ear.Astoria smiled warmly and nodded. This man always sent uneasy feelings through her body, and now she was gripping onto his arm in hopes she will not pass out or fall over. Many years prior Astoria always thought her father would be the one to walk her down the aisle and hand her over to her future husband. Astoria's heart ached for a moment to think about how she betrayed her family. Her father was murdered, mother was exiled, and Daphne was forced into induct in the Order of the Phoenix. It was all Astoria's fault. No matter what she did, it hurt someone. Astoria and Lucius reached the grand doors to the ceremony room, and she heard the orchestra playing on the other side. Pansy was standing in front of her, and she peered back lightly. Astoria's breathing was beginning to become unsteady, she needed to remind herself to exhale.Lucius lowered Astoria's veil and it suddenly became more real than it should have. Astoria felt flowers beginning to form in her hand and a bouquet sprouted before her eyes. "My son is quite the lucky man." Lucius growled. Astoria bit her bottom lip in angst and felt her chest begin to tighten. Maybe she was not ready for this. To be tethered to another man for the rest of her days. Astoria felt herself slightly shifting in her stance when the music switched to a different tune. The sounds of the guests rising to their feet to watch the bride walk down the aisle was apparent. Astoria Greengrass was to be no more, for now it will be Malfoy."Pansy..." Astoria croaked out. Pansy's eyes whipped around, and she gave her a nod. Astoria felt more at ease, when the doors flung open, and the bright lights hit her eyes. Candles floated just below the ceiling, and flowers hung on the walls. There he was at the altar, waiting for her. Suddenly everything felt right.****There she was. Draco tried to remain expressionless, but his smile broke through. Astoria looked immaculate. Like a perfect diamond that shined more brightly than anything else. Draco shifted his gaze to his mother when he realized she was staring through him intently. The smile that was plastered on his face fell, and he remained stiff.The veil that hung over her face was lightly beaded with tiny diamonds, just allowing enough of her own reflection through the material. Her wedding dress was a ball gown with a sweetheart neckline, strapless, and a train that stretched out further than the eye could see. When his eyes met hers, all was lost in the world. All cares, all thoughts of others, all that mattered in this moment was Astoria. It was always Astoria. The only eye sore in this situation was Lucius on his bride's arm. Draco furrowed his brows as he met his father's eyes, but then he locked eyes with his soon-to-be wife once more. Draco wanted nothing more but to stomp down the aisle and walk Astoria to the alter himself, but he needed to remain under his mother's spell, for now.Astoria and Lucius began to glide down the aisle to the sounds of the self-playing orchestra. Theo squeezed the top of Draco's shoulder and as Astoria was in the middle of the aisle everybody heard intruders in the Manor. Draco felt his hand reach to his jacket pocket to retrieve his wand."Where is he? WHERE IS THE MALFOY BOY!" Astoria's eyes widened and she dropped the flowers to her feet. The Ministry of Magic was here for Draco. Astoria ran to Draco's side and clutched onto his arm. The voices of the Auror's beyond the doors were growing louder. "Pansy!" Astoria whaled out. Pansy ran to Astoria's side and held onto her hand and tried to keep the bride calm, but the voices of the Auror's were growing. The Death Eater's were preparing for a battle, but all Draco was fixated on was fleeing with his bride. "Malfoy! By the orders of the Minister of Magic you are to be taken into our custody!" The Auror's shouted beyond the door. Lucius and other council members began to charm the grand doors to keep out the Auror's for as long as possible, but the spell was beginning to crack. Narcissa's eyes shot to her son's and before she could say a word Lucius had her by the hand and disapparated from the room.The grand doors were beginning fall when Theo grabbed Draco's arm. "Go. Take Tori with you. The Portkey will take you to the safehouse." "Thank you, mate."Draco whipped out his wand, took hold of his bride and apparated to the gardens of Malfoy Manor. Rain continuously fell from the sky and Astoria was anything but calm. "Oh, my Gods. They—they are—you are going to be---oh my—" Draco grabbed hold of her face and made her meet his eyes. "Astoria, now you need to listen to me." Sparks began to fill the air, and the screams of the Death Eaters filled their ears. The Auror's were beginning to place a magic hold onto the grounds and Draco only had one plan."We need to run." Draco commanded. Hand in hand the couple ran down the pathway of hedges exiting the Manor. Draco watched how Astoria's dress still looked gorgeous in the rain. Her hair stuck to her face, and her eyes blackened by smeared makeup. She was still the most gorgeous witch. The couple reached the end of the pathway when they caught the eyes of three other familiar faces. Draco clutched onto Astoria's hand firmly, and he noticed how Hermione's curly hair was straightened by the rain. Astoria let go of Draco's hand and walked toward the Weasley's and Granger. Draco was closely behind his bride, ready to grab her in an instance. His eyes clocked between George and Ginny Weasley how eyeballed him like a dangerous insect. "My debt to you is paid." Astoria murmured.Hermione nodded. When Draco looked at the once bushy haired witch in front of him, he once felt love, but now he felt nothing but peace. No spell was on him anymore to sway his feelings. He knew he had everything he wanted in the witch who stands next to him."Turn yourself in, Malfoy. Eventually the Ministry will catch you. Get it over with." The tiny Weaselbee spat. Malfoy chuckled and smirked. "Perhaps, but not today." Draco pulled on Astoria and the couple left the three other witch's and wizard behind. Astoria and Draco ran as fast as they could from the Manor. Running far from Hermione Granger, the Dark Lord, the Death Eaters, and everyone who ever wanted to split them up. Running through the rain in hand with the girl he loves felt oddly poetic. The rain felt as if it was cleansing them both of their hurtful memories, betrayed family members, and above all, scorned heartaches."The Portkey is hidden somewhere amongst the trees, but I am not sure what Theo would make it as..." Draco said while beginning to search for the unknown Portkey. Astoria ran behind a nearby oak tree and yelled. "It must be this!" The young witch pointed down at an empty fire whisky bottle with the initials T.N. imprinted on the glass. Theo Nott would make his emergency portkey a fire whisky bottle. Astoria clutched onto Draco's hand and a small smile planted on her face. Draco touched the bottle slightly and instantly the couple was flung from the pouring rain of the Manor, to a grassy plain of... somewhere? Astoria began to rub her head and look around; Draco did the same. "Where are we?" Astoria asked while cupping her eyes from the sun. Draco did not understand how he knew, but he knew his best friend well-enough to discover where he built his safehouse. "The Highlands of Scotland."

  The Burrow

  1999
Hermione stormed into the Weasley house with defeat in her heart and a strict agenda; leave the burrow. She could care less if she had just spent months in isolation in her past lovers' mansion, no, the only motive was to leave the Weasley's behind. They betrayed her and they betrayed Draco by summoning the Ministry to the wedding. Hermione could not get the image of Astoria and Draco fleeing their wedding from her mind. The Ministry probably caught up to them, and arrested Draco for his crimes. This put an ache in Hermione's heart. Everything she worked for, for him, would be lost if he were captured. The once bushy haired witch, now soaked straight by the rain, ran up to Ron's old room to pack up her belongings and flee. "'Mione, come now. You cannot possibly be angry with us—" "Do not presume to tell me how I should feel!" Hermione continued to stuff clothes into a duffel. George entered the room with his arms crossed and pinching his temple. "You realize we just Polyjuiced as two known Death Eaters and saved your little arse?" Hermione seized and took a step back. George was right. It was a great risk what Ginny and George did for her. Turning into Lilla and Antonin Dolohov was not easy task especially since-"You realize that witch was pregnant, correct? That was utterly painful for me!" Ginny exclaimed boldly. When a female witch uses Polyjuice potion to transform into a witch who is pregnant the process can be quite painful. The stomach swells itself enough to make the transforming witch presumably with child. Although, if a pregnant witch is attempting to use Polyjuice potion the after affects can be quite dangerous. Resulting in still birth or miscarriage. Hermione sets the duffle back down on the bed and closes it. Perhaps the Weasley's had good intentions when summoning the Ministry. Hermione is sometimes not in her right state of mind, and maybe she should be consulting a mind healer. For the past five years her life has consisted of worrying about Draco, falling in love with him and realizing she was not his soulmate. Hermione feels the hot tear begin to stream down her face when she realizes she needs to (actually) let Draco go. Hermione promised herself if she were rescued, she would let Draco and Astoria alone, and now it was time pay the piper. "George and I felt an obligation to our family to summon the Ministry. The Death Eaters are the reason Ron and Harry are dead, Hermione! How could you be cross with us when we were trying to justify our family!" Hermione squeezed her eyes shut and took in a deep inhale. "I am sorry for my outburst. I have had a rough time these past few weeks, or however long it has been." Hermione tossed aside the duffle and reached for her nearby wand. Hermione stood in front of a nearby mirror and casted a cleansing charm over herself. In an instant the curls came back to her hair, the grime from her face fled and her clothes became immaculate. "I am going to consult a Healer. Perhaps, it is time for me to start focusing on myself rather than..." Ginny strode forward and embraced her friend tightly. "Forget that git. We are your family." Hermione knew that in this moment it was time to focus on what she wanted most in life, and that was to leave the past in the past. Her life was going to look in a different direction for a change.
  
2005
Hermione heard her nearby alarm go off, and with a tired groan she swung her legs off the bed. Another day at work was ahead of her and she wanted nothing more but the sweet taste of caffeine between her lips. The curls of her hair dangled in her face and with a quick flick of her wand they instantly tamed. Hermione wandered into the kitchen to start a pot of coffee when she heard the morning groans of her husband from the other room. She called to ask if he wanted coffee and he politely agreed. The warmth of the liquid touched her lips and a small smile stretched across her face."Good morning darling." Hermione turned her head to see her husbands red hair disheveled, and his skin as pale as a ghost, per usual. "Morning, George. Sleep well?" Hermione handed him the mug and began to reach for her nearby briefcase. "Merlin, I am going to be late for my appointment with Healer Fitz. She will drop me as a patient if I continue to miss our sessions." Hermione traipsed into the bedroom to pull on a blazer followed by a grey pencil skirt. "You scheduled your appointment with Fitz before work? Rather early is it not?" Hermione huffed and quickly clipped her hair into a tight bun on the top of her head. "It was the only time I had available today. Now, you know we have dinner with Hannah and Neville tonight!" Hermione had been a patient of Healer Fitz for a couple of years, and she felt progress happening after only a mere couple sessions. Hermione and George felt it prudent to seek out a mind healer since the incident in Malfoy Manor. "Alright sounds dandy. If you are able on your lunch break, drop by the joke shop. I would love for you to see some new mouth bursting candies we got in just yesterday!" "If I have time, sure. I have mounds of work to do before the international muggle-born meeting."George lightly kissed his wife goodbye before she stepped into the Floo. Hermione took a step out of her Healer's fireplace to witness a welcoming smile from Fitz. She was greeted warmly and made herself comfortable on the armchair that sat next to a tray of lemon drop suckers. "How have you been feeling lately, Hermione?" Hermione began to twiddle her wedding rings in her hand and cross her left leg over her right. How had she been feeling lately? Some would say life could not be better for her. Hermione sought out all she wanted in life. She had a position in the Ministry of Magic as the Head Director of Muggle-Born's. After her career as fighting for the rights of magical creatures subsided, she was offered a head position at the Ministry. Being a muggle-born she felt obligated to accept the position, so she did, two years ago. The job gave her everything a young witch could want, high end attire, an ample book collection and a decent amount of power, but did it make Hermione happy? "I'm fine." She lied. Fitz began to scribble down some meaningless notes in her notepad and held the quill tightly in her fingers. "Have the nightmares stopped?" Oh, you mean the ones where she is trapped inside the dungeons of her soulmates mansion while he is on the upper level falling back in love with his soulmate? No."Yes." Fitz raised her eyebrow and huffed. She closed the binder and set it on a nearby end table. Her expression has shifted, and she put her elbows to hear knees. "Hermione, now, if you are not honest with me, how am I supposed to help you?" Maybe Hermione was tired of being helped, maybe all she wanted was to be left alone. Everyone around her was telling her how to feel about herself and other people, but what about how she felt personally? After the incident at the Manor all the Weasley's could discuss was how horrible Draco was because he did not rescue her. That topic choice was their top seller for months until Hermione finally snapped one day and told everyone to be tight lipped. It was never discussed at the dinner table again. Hermione decided to lay it all out for her Healer. It could not hurt, this was Fitz's job, to mend Hermione's mind. "Very well, I will be honest." Hermione uncrossed her legs and began to pace around the room. "Honestly, the nightmares have gotten worse. Ever since I married George, I feel like something inside me is trying to claw itself out and no one is around to help." Fitz raised her eyebrows and nodded. Hermione took a quick pause to catch her breath, she felt her eyes beginning to slightly pool, but she huffed them back. "Healer Fitz, I cannot stop thinking about him."Fitz reached for her pad and furrowed her brows. "And who is he Hermione?" "Draco Malfoy." Fitz nodded and scribbled more on that bloody parchment pad. Merlin knows what she could be jotting down. Probably calling Hermione mental for thinking about another man while she is a married woman.Hermione had shared that she had been in love with Draco at one point, but her feelings subsided when she married George. Lies upon lies. If anything, her marriage made her think about Draco more. It felt like a sick obsession that ate away at her mind day in and day out. "Tell me why he is still in your thoughts." Hermione took a seat once more and laid her head upon her hand. Why was Draco still on her mind? Wherever he was in the world, she was sure she was not in his mind. If Hermione were honest with herself then she would have to admit that—"I worry for him." Draco's safety was on her mind ever since she last saw him five years ago outside the Manor. The image of him standing in front of her drenched in rain and eyes filled with fear was a picture she could not erase.Hermione huffed when she realized how many years it had been. She felt mental that she was still pining over a school-boy crush who was clearly in love with another. "Where do you think he is now?" Hermione's eyes lowered to her hands and she began to fiddle, once more, with her rings. Sometimes she felt her wedding rings were a small handcuff wrapped around her, but in a way they were. Hermione was trapped inside the comfort of marriage with a man who loves her, but her mind carried the face of another man when she heard the word "love." "Wherever he is Healer Fitz, I hope he is anywhere but here. Draco would be bonkers to return to England when there is still a tag on his head by the Ministry." Healer Fitz continued to scribble down vigorously and when she finished, she summoned her teacup. After agonizing minutes of silence Hermione began to tap her foot to fill the gaps. "Tea?" Fitz offered her with a cup. Hermione shook her head and kept her eyes on the time. It was nearly time for her to get to the office, but Fitz was taking her sweet time in wrapping up the session. Merlin, sometimes Hermione wanted to slap the daylights out of this woman."I really must be off—" Fitz shook her head and pointed. "Sit." Fitz took another sip of her tea before setting it down gently on the saucer. "Now, Hermione. I need you to understand something. Marrying George was a positive move in your life. It allowed you to be surrounded by more loving family members and scored you a faithful partner." Fitz hesitated before she made her next point, but Hermione felt as if she were sitting on pins and needles. "It is to my observation that the reason you still feel connected to the Malfoy boy is because he did not want you." "That is not true!" Hermione interjected sharply.This healing session was not helping Hermione at all. Her mind still felt as foggy as ever, and if anything, it was making her blood pressure rise to unnatural altitudes. "You are an ambitious woman, and you aim to succeed in all you do. Am I wrong?" Hermione rolled her eyes and huffed. "Well, why do something if you are not going to succeed?" Fitz nodded and cleared her throat. "Draco was not yours to win, Hermione. If anything, you helped him win the heart of the other woman, what was her name... Astoria." Hermione did not disclose everything she knew about Astoria to Fitz but all she knew was she helped a fellow witch for her life. Which evidently, pushed her into Draco's arms more. "I am done talking about Malfoy." Hermione buttoned her blazer and snatched her suitcase. "You are going to make me late." Hermione stepped into the Floo and before she could mutter her destination Fitz sneaked in a final statement. "You can't save him, dear." Hermione yelped out her destination and before she knew it was, she was stepping out of one of the fireplaces in the Ministry of Magic, but to her surprise it was more chaotic than usual. People were everywhere, and she could not even cross the floor to snatch a copy of the Daily Prophet. All that was on Hermione's mind was what Fitz said to her on her way out. Why would she say that Hermione is unable to save Draco? Since when did he need saving? Hermione chalked up those words to be more mindless chatter from a mind healer used to induce Hermione's mind into thinking overtime. Hermione was reading over a briefing for an upcoming Muggle-Born children acceptance meeting when she heard her assistant, Aileen, knock at her door. "Yes, Aileen, what is it?" Hermione said while keeping her eyes on the parchments. "Sorry to bother you Mrs. Weasley but—" "Hermione, please, Aileen, I despise the Mrs." She said annoyed while pinching her temple. "Sorry Mrs---Hermione. Erm—have you had a chance to look over today's memo? The trial is to commence in an hour and—" Hermione peered over at the clock and noticed it was merely one in the afternoon. She despised sitting in on trials for the Ministry, but as head of one of the departments it was her obligation. Even though sometimes the trials were intriguing, often they were painfully boring. "Yes, thank you Aileen. I will look it over now." Hermione finished making touches to the brief she was working on prior, and she heard the hustle and bustle below. She looked outside her office window to notice people were pushing and shoving each other trying to get to the nearby elevators. Hermione scratched her head and tried to fathom why so many people were trying to get down to the courtrooms. Hermione took another sip of her tea and while summoning over the memo Aileen had put out for her hours prior. Hermione dropped her teacup to the ground, and it smashed into thousands of little pieces. Her hands began to shake as she kept reading paragraph after paragraph. Hermione shook her head and clutched the paper so tight in her hand that paper cuts formed around the edges of her fingers. The bushy haired witch connected the dots on why the Ministry was chaos today, and why so many people were shoving their way through the elevators. The memo explained the layout, charges, and possible consequences for Draco Malfoy. His trial was set for two in the afternoon. Hermione read Draco's charges, for the assassination of Albus Dumbledore, being an active member of the Dark Lord's council, fleeing custody in 1999 and attempt of murder of a Auror. As Hermione read the memo, she felt her chest tighten with every word, and her breath skipping with every paragraph she read. How did they find him? Did he come back? Was Draco ever in hiding? Did they also find Astoria? Thousands of questions were flooding Hermione's mind and all she wanted to do was storm down into the holding cells and look him in the eyes. She wondered if they had hurt him in the capture process. Hermione felt in her heart that one day Draco might have been captured by the Ministry, but she never thought she would have to watch his trial, much less, contribute on it. Before Hermione could form another coherent thought Aileen stepped inside once more and announced the trial was about to commence. Hermione nodded and placed the Ministry court robes over her body, along with the hat. With every step she took down towards the court room she felt her heart pounding out of her chest. She could not do this; she could not condemn this man she loves—cares for. Perhaps if she snuck out the side Floo and hid inside her home for the rest of the day nobody would notice she left. Then she could never know what happened and Draco's demise would remain a mystery. However, Hermione knew in her heart she could never forgive herself if she left the trial without at least looking at him. Attempting to save his life. She had to try, she needed to save him. The anxious Hermione sat with the other members of the departments and she overheard horrifying remarks about Draco left and right. "We will make sure this bastard gets what he deserves." One witch said on her left."Well, I am sure he will have his soul sucked out by the Dementors. No mercy for this one." A wizard said from behind her. The remarks were beginning to make her stomach churl and her forehead perspire. The Ministry had now let bystanders in from the public to watch the trial. Hermione scanned the crowd to find any familiar faces, and not to her surprise she spotted two right away. She noticed a, very pregnant, Pansy Parkinson and an quite agitated Theodore Nott. Hermione had heard many years prior that Theodore and Pansy were getting married, but she never felt Pansy was the mother type. She was surprised to see her having a baby.Pansy was wearing a black fitted dress with a large black rounded hat. Theo kept squeezing her hand every few seconds, but Pansy looked like she could burst into tears any moment. Hermione fixed her hat and shifted in her seat, and for a few moments she locked eyes with Theodore Nott. She did not know Theo too well, but she knew he was a good friend of Draco's. Theo nudged on Pansy's arm and she made eye contact with Hermione.Pansy looked stunned in this moment. She held her hand over her mouth and lowered her head, Theo proceeded to put his arm around her once more. The minutes before the trial started were agonizing. Every minute felt like an hour, and seconds felt like minutes. Finally, Minister Kingsley waltzed into the courtroom and took his seat at the high-top stand."I require silence at all times during this trial. If there is any commotion of any kind, the agitator will be escorted out." He said boldly while flipping through some scrolls on his table. "Bring forth the accused." Hermione's heart was no longer in her chest, but in her throat. She could feel her heartbeat in her head. The floor of the court room began to open, and the dungeons cage started to rise. The cage was silver and rusted, and as the cage rose, she could make out the person inside it more and more. To Hermione's surprise the Draco she once knew, was not the man in the cage. This Draco was thin, raged, black haired, and his eyes tired. Hermione fiddled with her wedding rings once more and waited for the trail to commence. "Draco Lucius Malfoy you are charged with murder, attempt of murder of an Auror, and fleeing custody..." Five years of wondering had led her to this moment. All the nightmares that kept her awake at night wondering if Draco were alive or dead. Hermione was seeing the man she loved once again before her, but not in the way she ever wanted too. Hermione gaped back down at Pansy and Theo, Pansy kept her hand on her stomach and kept fiddling with the necklace around her neck. Pansy looked more nervous than Hermione did for Malfoy's verdict.

  1999
Astoria continued to scan the area, but it was only grassland for as far as the eye could see. So much had happen within the last few hours and it was nearly dark, so the couple needed to make haste if they were going to discover the whereabouts of Theo’s safehouse.With every step Astoria took she felt the weight of her gown traipse behind her, the dress weighed a great deal more since it was drenched with water.Draco peered behind him to notice Astoria had the look of worry around her eyes, and he would be right. Astoria was worried out of her mind. Merely minutes prior Draco was about to be taken by Auror’s and now they were walking in the mountains of Scotland.Were they ever going to have a normal day?Draco took hold of Astoria’s hand and pointed out a nearby structure in the distance. Theo’s safehouse was protected by a Muggle-Repelling charm, and a ward that would only come down if magical blood that was pure was spilt.As the couple approached the cabin Draco revealed a tiny blade that sat upon a rock.“We need to sacrifice just a pinch of blood to enter. No worries.” Draco sliced his hand partly, so hints of blood hit the rock, and he slipped beyond the barrier.Astoria held the blade within her hands and glared up at Draco who was extending his hand waiting to welcome her to the other side. Without a second thought she sliced the palm of her hand and sacrificed drips of her own blood for the protection of the safehouse.She willingly took hold of Draco’s hand and he pulled her forward into his arms. She connected their lips and shared passionate kisses.“I am sorry I ruined our wedding.”Astoria placed a cold hand upon his cheek and shook her head lightly.“The day we are free, is the day I’ll be your wife.”Draco smashed his lips upon hers and carried her into the house. The couple broke the kiss and scanned the surroundings of their newfound home.Theo’s decorative skills were not too shabby. The living space had a stone fireplace, followed by a stocked bar cart to the side of it (typical Theo).The bedroom held a four-poster bed with maroon colored comforter and sheets. Astoria’s favorite part were the wall decorations. Theo (or possibly Pansy) did a phenomenal job with the artwork, and even bestowed pictures of the gang from school days.Astoria glided her hand around the end table that held her favorite picture in the room. It was a magical photograph that showed Draco and Theo holding their broomsticks, preparing for a quidditch match. This may have been in their fifth year?“I miss watching you play quidditch.”Draco came up behind his girl and began to hug her from behind. “I was a rather gifted Seeker if I do say so myself.”Astoria spun around and laced her arms around his neck and chuckled. “Such a prat.” She said sarcastically while laying a soft kiss upon his lips.The dress was beginning to stick to her body in ways that was making her uncomfortable and freezing cold. She attempted to unlace the dress herself, but it was nearly impossible.“Allow me.” Draco whispered in her ear.Astoria felt each piece of fabric give way from her back and every time she felt his fingers against her skin it sent shivers down her body.Draco began to kiss along her shoulders and moved her hair to expose her neck. “Did I tell you how gorgeous you look?”Astoria chuckled and lightly turned her head to whisper. “You conveniently left that part out, I am afraid.”Draco made a pouting sound and ran his hands around the skin of her neck, laying soft kisses along her upper back. It was remarkable how Astoria melted at this man’s touch. The world could be crumbling before her, but if Draco has her hand, she knows she can walk through the fire.Draco flicked his hand to set the fireplace ablaze. The warmth of the flames engorged Astoria’s damp skin, and she did not know what was warming her body faster. Draco’s hot mouth on her skin, or the radiating flames that laid before her.Draco slipped off her gown and allowed it to fall to her feet, leaving her in her white laced slip.“I enjoy looking at you in your gown, but- “Draco spun her around, and locked her gaze. “-I prefer you without it.” He purred.Astoria closed her eyes and absorbed every word this man said to her. She whispered into his ear, “Take me, right here, and now.”Without another word Draco smashed his lips upon hers and laid her on the ground next to the roaring fire. Astoria could feel her skin drying from the fire, but something else inside her was building.The young witch rolled over the man she loved and straddled him and placed passionate kisses upon his lips. With every kiss more layers of her clothes were falling to the floor.Draco’s grasps upon her body were firm, but gentle. For once, there was no one else around. It was only Astoria and Draco, alone, to embrace the love they share.“Tell me you love me.” She demanded.Draco smirked and tightened his grasp against her body. “Merlin, I fucking love you.” He laid a peck of a bruise on her chest and glared up at her. “You are mine.”Astoria pushed him back down to the ground and tightened her thighs against his. “And you are mine.” She growled.Draco and Astoria made love until the dawn, countless highs, and more times than humans can endure. The couple laid entwined in each other’s bodies on the ground, still next to the fireplace, merely wrapped in a sheet. The sun caught Astoria’s eyes and caused her to snap awake, but the next sound surprised her more.“Hey Mate, I—Oh! Bloody hell!” Theo said in the floo closing his eyes.Draco’s eyes snapped open, and he covered Astoria’s naked body with the sheet and looked at his best friends’ head popping out of the fireplace floo.“Sorry Mate, I should have sent an owl—” Theo said with an embarrassed tone.“Don’t worry about it. Why are you in the floo? Why did you not come by?” Draco inquired while pulling on a pair of trousers.Theo shook his head (the only part of him that was visible) and huffed. “It’s not safe for us yet. It is utter madness here. After you left the ceremony, I grabbed Pansy and apparated back home.” Theo paused but Astoria immediately interjected.“What is the news of Granger? Draco and I saw her with the Weasley’s.”Astoria could not help but to draw attention to the thought of the bushy haired witch who helped her years prior imprionsed by her hand. As much as Astoria knew that Hermione must have despised her, she wanted her to leave the dark side behind her. Astoria and Draco did not fit into Hermione’s world anymore, no matter how badly Hermione wanted to entwine herself with Draco.Theo shook his head and shared that nothing new had been disclosed yet from Granger. Draco explained how Hermione would keep quiet about everything that happened to her over the years, because he knew, Hermione still had love in her heart for Draco.Theo told his two best friends that he would visit the following day with Pansy to bring them suitcases of clothes and a few of their personal effects. Astoria felt grateful for all that Theo was doing for her and Draco, plus she desperately needed some new clothes. She could not waltz around in a wedding slip forever (even though Draco disagrees with that notion.) The following morning Astoria was awoken to the sounds of beautiful birds outside her window. Could it all be a dream? She thought to herself.She slipped out of the bed and breathed in the fresh Scotland air. Astoria felt a source of comfort in nature. In the fresh open grasslands, there was no one around who wanted to harm her or the man she loved, plus the extensive blood magic on the wards was also occupying her worried mind.Astoria peered over at the sleeping wizard nestled against his pillow. She watched how his chest rose and fell for a few moments before she placed a soft kiss on his forehead.The young witch slipped the laced slip over her body and ventured out onto the porch. She noticed that there was an enchanted drawer next to her, and whatever she needed she could reach in for it.All she wanted was a good read to distract her mind and allow her thoughts to venture off into a blissful daydream.Astoria reached her hand into the drawer and pulled out the novel Anna Karenina. She had never read this novel before and was excited to delve deep into a story that revolved around faith fidelity, and hypocrisy.The young blonde was halfway through her read until she heard the pounding footsteps of another blonde inside.Draco came outside and sipped on a cup of tea and watched the young witch before him read her novel. Her gaze grew more serious with every page she turned. The story was intensifying, promises were being broken, lives were being twisted until—“Enjoying yourself, darling?”Astoria shifted in her seat and realized she was reading with her elbows on her knees. She felt like she was snapped out of an intense stare down.“Erm—sorry.” She placed the book on the table and crossed her legs. “I have not read a book in…what feels like forever. I guess, I was lost in words.”Draco snorted and summoned another cup of tea for the girl next to him. She thanked him with a touchless kiss and sipped lightly.“If that bloke does not show up tonight with some decent food, I fear I may perish from hunger.” Draco spat while pinching his temple.“When will Theo and Pansy arrive? I cannot keep wearing this slip. It is becoming to feel quite uncomfortable.”Draco stood up and began to unbutton his shirt slowly in front of her and Astoria chuckled lowly.“Not again, Draco. My thighs are in pain, and I am not sure if she can handle—”“Wear my shirt.” He tossed it onto her lap. “Even though I would prefer if your bare bum traipsed around this house, I would settle for the image of you in my shirt.” He purred and topped it off with a wink.Astoria laughed lowly and stood up before him. With hunger in her eyes, and intent in her mind. She placed the shirt on the table next to her and stood in between Draco’s legs.Astoria slowly let the straps of her slip dangle off her shoulders until it was just barely covering her breasts. The sensation of the lace brushing against her nipples were causing them to harden, plus the gaze of the handsome man before her did not hurt.Suddenly, the slip fell from her body, exposing her nudity. Astoria smirked and rose one eyebrow.“I may have a cure for your ravenous hunger.” Astoria purred against her breathy words.Draco pulled Astoria forward with both hands on her bum, and leaving hot kisses along her stomach, inching down to her sex.He picked up the tiny witch and placed her onto the porch ledge and kept her stable. He fell to his knees and began to place kisses on the inside of her thighs, causing Astoria to feel the build of heat throughout her body. Every kiss he laid she felt a soft bruise form. This man’s mouth never disappointed.“Breakfast is served.” Draco purred before he buried his face between her legs.Astoria gripped onto the back of his head and raked her finger through his hair. She felt his tongue swirling around the bud of her clitoris, followed by slight flicks after every swirl.“Oh gods—” Draco continued his tongue work, and with every kiss he laid Astoria felt herself drawing closer and closer to unraveling by the mercy of this man’s tongue.“I---I—may—” She croaked out while she felt her toes curling without her control.Draco kissed the top of her sex. “Don’t resist me.” He growled.He began to swirl his tongue around her clitoris once more, and she felt him slip two fingers inside of her. Draco inched his fingers up as far as he could, causing Astoria to cry out more.Astoria was nearly at her climax until Draco began to slightly apply sucking pressure onto her clitoris and without her control, she unraveled by the command of his tongue.She felt her body build up energy and release it with every tremor. The more she pulsated the firmer Draco’s grip between her legs became, and the faster his tongue swirled around her clitoris.Astoria cocked her head back and let out deep breaths. Draco rose his head and pulled her face forward, leaving a passionate kiss upon her lips.“I think I’ll have a shower.” Draco purred.Astoria nodded and as she watched him walk away, she caught her breath and fixed her stance. She buttoned up Draco’s shirt over her body and continued to read her book. She wanted to finish this, she needed to know the ending. Later that evening, Astoria found herself dozing off on the couch when she heard knocks at the door. In strode Theodore Nott with suitcases of clothes, and personal items for herself, and Draco. Next to him, walked in Pansy Parkinson with bags of food and liquor (they know each other all too well.)“Tori!” Pansy rushed toward Astoria and embraced her tightly. “I am so so sorry about your wedding. Those damn Auror’s! I hope the house is alright! Theo and I we were preparing it for weeks and—”Astoria shushed her friend and gave her a warm smile. “Don’t worry Pansy, Draco and I are fine, in fact, we feel better than we ever have. You both did an amazing job with this safehouse.”Astoria grabbed hold of one of the suitcases and desperately wanted to change outfits. Inside the case she found most of her wardrobe from the Manor, which included clothes of elegance, but casual attire as well.The young witch slipped on a green blouse followed by black dress pants. She flicked her wand and her hair instantly pinned itself up into a bun with curly tendrils to the side of her head. Astoria was always fond of her long blonde hair, she always admired how it shined in the sun. The felt the blonde hair compensated her brown eyes quite well.When Astoria went back out to join the room, she noticed Theo and Draco were agitated, and Pansy was attempting to calm down her fiancé. What could have possibly happened while she left the room for merely five minutes?“Malfoy, it is the only way!” Nott exclaimed broadly.Pansy stood on the side of Draco and nudged at his arm. “Draco, please, think of Astoria. Sooner or later the Ministry will come looking for her as well.”Draco lunged himself from her grasp and Theo’s gaze. He held the whisky glass in his hand firmly and downed the remaining liquid.“Who are we to hide like commoners? I will not subject myself or Astoria to live like filthy muggles.” Draco spat.Astoria strode forward and began to come to the realization what the situation was about. She walked toward Theo and asked him what was causing such commotion.Theo took a deep inhale, but was at a loss for words, suddenly Pansy stepped forward to take the lead. “You both need to assume new identities, and live like muggles, if you are to hide from the Ministry.”Astoria lowered her gaze and stared at her fingertips. How could she live without magic? It was impossible. Magic was embedded in her DNA; it is all she ever knew. If she lost magic, then she would lose a part of herself.However, if it was the only way they were going to be securely hidden from the Ministry, sacrifices were going to be made.Astoria nodded slowly, and slowly walked over to an enraged Draco staring deep into his empty rocks glass. She firmly grasped his hand and entwined her fingers with his. Astoria pulled his head to meet her eyes and looked past his worry, and into his soul.Draco sighed and closed his eyes, and with a quiet kiss on her forehead he rejoined in conversation.“What will the boundaries be?”“Wand magic, particularly. Within the walls of the house, you will be allowed to partake in voiceless magic, but outside, you will both be muggles.” Theo stated hesitantly while his fiancé clutched onto his arm.“This is bollocks. Draco Malfoy living the life of a muggle it is—”“The only way.” Astoria interjected firmly.Pansy stepped forward and opened her arms. “You will still be you; it is only when you venture outside the safehouse will you be under an identity spell.”“The spell will shield our true identities?”“It will do more than that. The identity spell will shield your true identities. Muggles, and other magic folk will see your faces…. differently...” Pansy said while she began to rummage in the suitcase.Astoria realized that for her and Draco to be safe, they were going to need to become someone else.Draco stepped behind Astoria and placed his arm upon her shoulder. “It is your decision, Astoria. I will only do this if you are with me.”Astoria nodded, and realized she wanted to do one last thing before changing her identity. She instructed Pansy to grab the enchanted camera out of one of the suitcases and capture the last moment.Pansy agreed and began to point the camera at Draco and Astoria.“I want us to look back on it and remember, we are Astoria and Draco.” Astoria said proudly.As Pansy began to snap the picture Draco spun her around and kissed her cheek, and for a mere moment happiness filled the air. The photograph flew out of the top of the device and it landed in Pansy’s tiny hand. It was a marvelous snapshot.The couple sat on the couch and entwined their fingers. Embracing the next chapter of their life.Pansy and Theo stood in front of them and held out their wands. With a small tap on Draco and Astoria’s head, their hair color began to change.Draco’s once spotless platinum blonde hair now turned jet black and shined brightly in the darkness.Astoria long blonde hair began to shrink up to her shoulders, and the hair strands began to churn into a russet brown. Hints of curl flowed through her roots, down to the tips.Astoria and Draco looked at one another and smiled lowly. She felt a sigh of relief.“What is it?” Draco whispered while furrowing his brows.Astoria held Draco’s face in her hand and smiled. She looked deeply into his grey eyes and felt a single hot tear stream down her cheek.“I am just relieved. Your eyes are still your eyes.”Draco gave her hand a tiny kiss and his gaze went to Theo who was explaining the next step in the identity spell process.“Next, you will be given new identities. The new identities will only be viable when you are with people other than Pansy or I.”Astoria and Draco nodded as they watched the couple tapped their wands on the crown of their heads. A white flash appeared in the room, and Astoria waited for something to happen. She wondered if she would feel different, but she felt nothing.“You are now Dean and Victoria Eddington. You are a newlywed couple who grew up in Scotland. You have traveled from Glasgow, looking for a new life in the country. You are a peaceful couple who does not want to draw attention. Got it?” Theo instructed firmly at both, but Astoria knew his focus was on Draco.After the best friends ate some dinner, and exchanged some petty light-hearted jokes about the situation, along with some cheap wine, the night was concluded.Theo and Pansy were exchanging their farewells and explained how they will visit several times a week to keep the peace between Draco and Astoria.Astoria met Pansy out on the porch to ask her an important favor, that had been weighing on her mind ever since she arrived in the safehouse.“I need you to check in on Lilla. See if she has had her baby, and if she has, please, Pansy, try and get her out. She does not deserve to be in a life of servitude.” Astoria pleaded while keeping her arms tucked in tight. There were hints of worry trickled throughout her words.Pansy nodded but gave an uneasy facial expression. “I will check in on her, but I cannot promise anything.”Just as Pansy and Astoria were exchanging quiet last words, so were the men of the group. Draco and Theo stood next to the rock that sat on the border of the safehouse wards. The men spoke somewhat lowly.“Has there been any news of the council? Is the Dark Lord furious we have fled?”Theo shrugged his shoulders and leaned in. “I dunno. Pansy nor I have heard nothing from the High Council. The Dark Lord has not given any instruction regarding your immediate return.”Draco nodded and crossed his arms. “You will inform me if he is attempting to snatch back Astoria, yeah?”“You know I will. You and Tori are my family. Pansy and I are going to do all we can to keep you guys safe.” The two best friends exchanged one last handshake before Theo summoned his fiancé.As Theo and Pansy took the Portkey back to England, Astoria found herself walking aimlessly through the house, particularly avoiding mirrors. However, when she walked into the hallway to the bedroom a large mirror was displayed over a table. Astoria glared at the woman in the mirror, and for a moment she did not recognize her. A woman with brown hair, but her eyes were still Astoria’s eyes. “This is Victoria.” Astoria thought to herself as she let out a low exhale.She felt a pair of strong arms come up behind her and embrace her tightly. “You look beautiful.”Astoria chuckled and spun herself around. “You look good too, Dean.” She planted a soft kiss upon his lips.

  2000
To say Astoria was excited for a night out with one of her closest friends was an understatement. She could hardly contain her joy when trying to pick out the perfect blouse or dress. She modeled different outfits in front of Draco, and finally she landed on the perfect ensemble. A simple satin tan blouse, followed by a fitted skirt, paired with short chunky heels.It had been almost a year since Astoria and Draco came to the Nott safehouse, and life for both was almost close to perfection.Of course, adapting to strictly wandless magic took some time (more for Draco), but the couple has managed to find solace. Pansy and Theo had brought more personal items for their friends, such as Astoria’s artists’ easel, and Draco’s broomstick. The young wizard missed the fresh open air while whizzing around, so Theo indulged.The inside of the safehouse had turned into Astoria’s gallery. Every time she felt inspired, or saw a beautiful view, she had to paint. On some occasions Draco painted a few canvas’, but his idea of artwork was painting Astoria in the nude (those paintings were hidden in their bedroom). Astoria was against the idea at first, but once she saw how much Draco enjoyed himself, how could she deny him? Plus, after every painting they most likely made love until the paint was dry. Astoria called it ‘payment’ for Draco’s artistry services.However, the couples’ favorite piece of artwork was of themselves. Draco and Astoria painted their own portraits of them as a couple, and with the help of Theo’s wand the portrait became enchanted. Draco wanted there to be a real wizarding portrait of who they were, not the cold representation one they have in Malfoy Manor. In the portrait they created themselves it was nothing but smiles and soft hand kisses.For many months now Draco and Astoria have been secluded in the safehouse. Neither of them wanted the other person to venture out, incase the identity charm was faulty, and they were recognized. Their whole world would crumble (again), and they would be forced to relocate.But tonight, Astoria was going out to a pub with Pansy to enjoy a few pints and indulge in some social activity with some other people. Astoria primped her skin, fixed the hem of her skirt and waited for Pansy’s arrival.“Do I look okay?” She inquired while hooking the backs of her earrings.Draco chuckled and gave her a smirk. “No.”Astoria smacked her arm harmlessly and sat upon his lap. She hooked her arms around his neck and looked at him with a playful pout.“You look positively...” He left a soft kiss on the inside of her neck. “…gorgeous.”Astoria blushed and connected their lips in a passionate kiss. As they exchanged a few more pecks the fireplace lit up with green flames and the Nott’s strolled on through.Pansy and Theo were officially married on New Year’s Eve, and it saddened Draco and Astoria greatly that they could not attend. Astoria was asked to be one of the bridesmaids, but she felt it was too dangerous to come out of hiding, plus she did not want to attend without Draco. The four friends gathered after the Nott’s honeymoon, and had a quaint celebration of their own. It was the first time since Hogwarts that Astoria sat on the floor and drank wizarding vodka with her schoolmates. Surely, a night she will never forget.“Evening love birds.” Pansy chirped.A few moments later the green flames appeared once more, and Theo stepped through.“’Ello Tori, ‘ello Malfoy.” Theo swung his arm around his wife and popped a squat on the nearby sofa.“Did you bring the- “Theo held up a full bottle of fire whisky and both women rolled their eyes.“Good man.” Draco said boldly.After a few minutes of a debriefing conversation, Astoria and Pansy were ready to depart for the pub. They gave their men a goodbye kiss and set off into the night.Astoria held onto Pansy’s arm and she disapparated them into Edinburgh, a busy town in Scotland, not too far from the safehouse. Highly muggle populated town, hardly any magical folk gathered in the pubs.Astoria had not been around other people in many months, and now that she was here, she felt her nerves beginning to break. What if the charm was faulty? What if someone recognized her and demands to know where Draco is? So many things could go wrong, and it would be Astoria’s fault because she left the safehouse boundaries—“Hey, you. You need to get out of your own head.” Pansy said while slinging her arm around Astoria.Astoria shook her head in attempts to reset her mind and nodded. She was going to have a fabulous time at this pub, and she was going to get zonked out.The girls had been sitting at the pub for no more than an hour, and there were people all around them. Astoria was sipping on her pint when suddenly somebody bumped into her shoulder causing her to flinch.“Aye! I am sorry!” The man said quickly.Astoria furrowed her brows and focused in on this person, she knew this man.“Seamus?” She asked lowly without thinking.“Ehhh-- hello. Do I know ya’?” Seamus asked suddenly looking quite confused.Pansy kept her head turned in attempts not to look Seamus in the eyes, because she was not under the identity spell. If Seamus witnessed Pansy with Astoria with another young woman, he would know it was Astoria Greengrass. Pansy gave a small nudge on Astoria’s arm before excusing herself quickly from the situation.Astoria had to think quick before he started asking more questions. “No. Sorry. Wrong person.” She swirled back in her seat and continued to sip on her drink, but Seamus was not budging.“No, you knew my name. Do I know ya’? You obviously know me…” He said while trying to look more clearly into her face.“My name is Victoria…” Sip. “I erm…just moved to town with mi’ husband.” In attempts to sound like she was from Scotland, her accent was less convincing.“Husband, eh? You kinda’ look familiar… did we… erm---go to school together?”Astoria felt her forehead begin to sweat, and her hands begin to clam. What was she going to say? Merlin, she should not have said his bloody name…“No, we did not. Now, if you please…” She swung back around, once more, and continued to drink her pint.“Well…erm---a’ight. Pity you’re married. I would have bought ya’ a pint. You’re quite gorgeous…. Tori.” Seamus said to her lowly with a wink, and within moments he fled the scene.Once Seamus exited the pub Pansy rejoined Astoria at the bar and inquired what happened. Astoria informed her quickly.“Oh! Thank Gods, he did not know you. That means the identity charm worked…”Astoria shook her head. “Yeah…but...he called me Tori. Like he knew me. Maybe this was a bad idea…”Pansy shushed her friend and bought another round of drinks. She desperately wanted Astoria to loosen up and enjoy this precious time in her life, the time for partying and making bad decisions with friends. After all, Astoria was in her early twenties, this was the prime of her life!However, the alcohol was beginning to flow a little too deep within Astoria and her speech was becoming slurred, and words began to spill from her mind a little to easily.“You…are sssoo...luc—lucky… Pans.”Pansy chuckled to herself and clutched onto her pint.“Why is that?”Astoria wiped a single tear from her cheek and took another slug from her pint. “Be—because! You—you are marrrieedd! And I’m not.”Pansy put her arm around Astoria and hugged her close, but that only made her even more sad.“Tori—”“Do nottt pretend to know how I feel…Mrs. Nott.” She slurred while trying to find her balance on the barstool.“Draco loves you. That stupid git loves you to pieces, do you not realize that?” Pansy spat while attempting to snag the pint away from Astoria’s weak hands, she failed.“Of course, he loves me. I do not pose nude for just anybody y’know?”Both girls chuckled lowly, and Pansy gave her intoxicated friend a tight squeeze on the shoulders.“I er---jjust wish I did not have the life I do, Pans.” She admitted lowly.Pansy seemed to shift in her seat, and she began to fiddle with her wedding’s bands. The conversational air shifted into a more serious tone. Pansy’s voice dropped into a whisper.“You only have this life, and in this very moment, you have a man who would kill for you, and he has.”Astoria snorted and she leaned into gaze into Pansy’s dark eyes. “And I have killed to get him back into my life.”Astoria felt Pansy’s mood shift when she would start discussing her dark past. It was true, Astoria had murdered several people in her time, and mainly for Draco’s love. The man’s love was intoxicating too the point of addiction. Once you have a taste, there is no rehabilitation. She fell in love with his eyes, his voice, and his dark façade. Who would run away from that?Suddenly, another person who meant a great deal to Astoria traveled to the front of her mind. It had been over a year since she has seen Lilla.“I am a horrible human being, Pansy. I am an awful friend. I was not there for Lilla when she lost her baby, and I could not get her out of the Death Eaters. How could I betray her so?” Astoria felt hot tears beginning to roll down her cheeks but with every tear she took another slug of the pint, in which she ordered a fresh one.It seemed Pansy was holding back tears because she kept her hand near her face. Some time after Draco and Astoria arrived to the safehouse, Pansy informed them of Lilla’s current situation. It appeared that after the failed Malfoy wedding, Lilla birthed her first child. Lilla survived the magical birth, even with all the complications that could arise, but the baby was not viable (she was told). Pansy stated that all she knew of the situation that after the child’s death, Antonin whisked his wife away and she spends her days in solitude. This made Astoria feel even worse about herself. Everyday she thought of her best childhood friend, and how she left her in the most important time of her life. She hoped and prayed to the Gods that one day she could be the savior and whisk Lilla away to safety.“It is not your fault. Dolohov is a trying man, but she is also under the High Council’s protection. Antonin would never harm her—”“That isss—not the point!” Astoria exclaimed boldly. “Me, I was not there for HER! Lilla’s parents sold her off at seventeen, and I was the one who was supposed to help her! Now here I am drinking in this Gods forsaken muggle pub while she is in solitude mourning her dead child.” Astoria polished off the remainder of the pint and stormed out the doors of the pub.The rain from the sky came down heavily, the moon was covered by dark storm clouds. The rain hitting her skin brought back the memories of running from Malfoy Manor. The rain in her hair and engorging her gown. Astoria held her eyes closed, and she felt someone grab onto her hand.“’Ello… Tori…” Seamus Finnigan whispered to her. He appeared to be too intoxicated for his own good.“Evening Seamus. I thought you’d left.” She lurched her arm free and kept her arms crossed.“Err---well I was here and there.” Seamus began to stroll forward towards her until he was inches from her face. “My, my, you do look like this one girl from me’ school. She was beautiful just as you…but her hair was blonde…and she was kinda’ mean, but her name was also Tori…” Seamus slurred as he attempted to touch the ends of her wet hair.Astoria jumped back and she tried her hardest not to say anything that would give away her identity. At least she knew the identity spell was working, to an extent.“Erm---well she sounds divine. Now, if you will excuse me—” Astoria attempted to walk past him, but she once again grabbed hold of her arm.“Her name was Astoria. I wish I’d known her well, but she disappeared…” Seamus paused, and Astoria held her breath. “Boy…do you look like her though…” Seamus began to run his finger along her jawline and Astoria froze in her tracks and before she could open her mouth the pub doors flew open.Seamus flinched and his eyes bulged. “Parkinson? Pansy Parkinson?”Pansy stood in her tracts and kept her wand drawn. Finally, Seamus looked at Astoria and then back at Pansy. His eyes bulged from his head, and he immediately drew his wand at the two girls.“It is you. I knew it!” Seamus exclaimed.“Seamus…listen to me…” Astoria pleaded.Pansy kept her wand pointed, and was ready to stun him, but he spoke too freely.“Just you two wait, The Order of the Phoenix is not dead, and we will defeat You-Know-Who! That includes his precious Death Eaters!” Seamus’ eyes fixated on Astoria’s and she held her arms to her chest.“I’m counting on it.” Astoria said lowly.Pansy stunned Seamus to the ground, and immediately obliviated his mind of the last few hours. Erasing any memory of running into Astoria at the pub or having this quarrel.“I want to go home.” Astoria said lowly and she proceeded to walk towards the safe disapparation zone.****“Cheers, mate.” Theo clinked his whisky class with Draco while proceeding to take a seat on a nearby armchair. “So, tell me honestly, how do you fancy the muggle life?”Draco snorted and gave his friend the middle finger. What was he supposed to say? His entire life he was raised to believe that the magic life is the only life, and any other is minority. Draco was brought up on the beliefs that magic is might. “It is bloody awful not being able to use wand magic for anything, but in all honesty—” Draco polished off his glass handed it to Theo to be refilled. “This is the happiest I have ever felt in my life. I have everything a man could want. Security, endless galleons, decent whisky and a gorgeous woman to hold in my arms at night.”Theo winked at Draco and the guys continued to share their experiences about the women they loved. It was truly special how two schoolmates fell in love with some of the most hated females in Slytherin house. The irony was uncanny.After about a bottle and a half of fire whisky Draco felt his emotions becoming heightened and his words spilling off his tongue more smoothly. The only person ever on his mind was Astoria. She was the first person he thought of in the morning, and the last at night.“How is married life? I cannot imagine how good a wife Pansy Parkinson is…” Draco teased but Theo chuckled along.“Pansy is the best lady for me. She is beautiful, strong, independent, and is loyal to the people she loves. Plus, she is the best shag I have had in my life, hands down.” Theo said while holding up his glass to clink with his mate.Draco knew how good Pansy was in bed, since he has had more than a few times in his life. But those times of discussing his shagging sessions with Pansy were over since she was now married to Theo.There was silence for a total of five minutes and Theo could tell something was weighing on Draco’s mind. He kept shifting in his seat and uncrossing and re-crossing his legs. Theo could see Draco staring down to the bottom of his whisky glass.“Whisky for your thoughts.” Theo said while handing him the almost empty bottle.Draco accepted it gladly and put down his glass to begin drinking straight from the bottle. After two swigs, Draco was ready to confess what had been on his mind for weeks now.“I want to marry her.” Draco admitted lowly.Theo smiled wider than he ever could have and smacked Draco on the back of his shoulder. The young man could not have looked any prouder of his best friend.“Gonna’ do it right this time?”Draco chuckled and began to twiddle with the Slytherin insignia ring on his finger. The ring was rather bulky, but was platinum banded with a rather large emerald stone in the middle. Nonetheless, the ring was breathtakingly beautiful, but perhaps it was time for it to become transformed?Draco pulled off the ring and handed it to Theo.“You love this ring; I cannot take this...” Theo proceeded to hand it back over to Draco, but he pushed it back.“No, you git. I erm---I cannot return home to fetch a proper engagement ring, so I need you to transfigure it. I don’t have a wand here so…”Not owning a wand played heavier on Draco than initially anticipated, but he knew why it was safer to have his and Astoria’s wand hidden from the Ministry. Wands could be traced hundreds of miles to their owners, and Draco could not take that risk, nor could Astoria. The British Ministry of Magic was fully aware that the wedding they stormed in on was Draco and Astoria’s and if they found Astoria from her wand, they would find Draco.Theo nodded brightly and held the ring in his hand tightly. “I’d be honored.”Theo pulled out his wand and laid the Slytherin ring on the coffee table. Draco watched a tiny light hit one of his most prized possessions, but it was not sadness he was feeling, but excitement. He wanted to show Astoria how much she meant to him, and it was time he had representation on her finger.Theo transfigured Draco’s Slytherin ring into a small platinum banded engagement ring with tiny diamonds on the side of the large emerald at the center. A ring fit for any soon-to-be Malfoy.Draco held it in his hand and tucked it away in his pocket. As the young wizards were beginning to toast to Draco’s future proposal the front door swung open. Astoria and Pansy arrived home.Both men shot up to greet their ladies, and the two girls debriefed about their entire evening. Astoria explained what happened with Seamus Finnigan and Pansy assured them all that she obliviated him. However, the guys were not too pleased about the situation.“That slimy Irish bug.” Theo spat. “How dare he presume to know which side we are on.”Pansy linked her arm through Theo’s and rested her head on his shoulder. Theo placed a soft kiss upon her head. “Do not worry, he will not be a problem.”Draco caressed Astoria’s cheek with his thumb and looked at her like he was giving her a physical examination. “Did he hurt you? If had, he is---”“I am fine.” She interjected while entwining her fingers with his. “Pansy and I had a fabulous time tonight. Did you two do anything fun besides talk about your sex lives over bottles?”Both guys chuckled and shook their heads. “That about sums it up.” Theo admitted.Pansy and Theo announced they would be departing for the night. The best friends exchanged quick hugs and Theo gave Draco a wink of encouragement. The couple stepped into the floo fireplace one by one until they were both gone.“Shall we retire? I am exhausted.” Astoria exclaimed while starting to walk back into the bedroom.“Yes, I will catch up with you.” Draco yelled from the other room. He clutched onto the ring in his pocket and wanted to wait for the perfect moment.The couple slid into bed and Draco wrapped his arms around the most amazing woman he could ever hope for. He could smell the scent of her shampoo in her (now brown) hair. Draco would never totally admit this to Astoria, but he preferred her brown hair, he felt it brought more color to her face and accentuated her big brown eyes.Draco moved her hair away from her neck and began to leave a trail of kisses on her shoulders. He could see her developing goosebumps on her arms, and she was exhaling more deeply with every kiss.He began to run his hands down the sides of her body, and just brushing up against the sides of her chest.“Don’t tease me.” She said softly and breathlessly.Draco turned her over on her back and kissed her passionately. “Now, why would I want to tease you?” He said sarcastically.Astoria kissed his lips intently and deepened each kiss. The more kisses that were exchanged the stronger their passion became. Astoria ran her thumb along Draco’s bottom lip, and he instantly began to suck on her thumb. Astoria bit the bottom of her lip and the image of her caused Draco to become more erected than ever.The young witch smashed her lips upon his and straddled him instantly. Astoria began to grind herself against his torso. Every time they were going to make love it was like listening to a symphony build up tempo. The longer the piece, the slower the build up until suddenly the conductor directs the final crescendo.Draco slipped off the top of his trousers exposing his erection and he snapped off Astoria’s knickers. While Astoria was on top, she slid herself onto him, and had no time to adjust to his size. Draco could tell the instant feeling of his cock inside caused an electric pulsation that ran through her body.She had the desire to grind as hard and quickly as she could. The quicker she grinded the more he felt her climax arising, but Draco placed his hands on her hips and began to guide her to his own motion.“Not yet, sweetheart.” He purred. Draco sat up and held her in place on his lap. He began to lightly glide inside of her and laid passionate kisses along her chest.Draco took the image of her face in his mind. Her hair disheveled, her mouth gasping for either air or his lips, and her eyes. Astoria’s eyes looked as if she was a hunter, and he was the prey. The darkness that hid behind her eyes was astonishingly sexy.“Gods…you’re beautiful.” He growled against her lips. “So…fucking…ergh---gorgeous.” With every pump Draco felt he could unravel at any moment.“I love you.” Astoria purred against his lips before connecting them.Draco slid himself into her as far as he could go and embraced her firmly. He slid hair off her shoulders and ran his thumb along her jawline. “I love you immensely.”Draco pushed Astoria onto her back and began to pump himself into her forcefully, and he could tell she was coming close to her climax. Every time Astoria was about to climax, she would curl her toes, ball her fists, and bite her left fist. This signaled to Draco that he needed to thrust himself into her more intently for her climax to explode.Draco witnessed her orgasm at its height. Her abdominal muscles twitched, and she let out a low moan. Draco thrusted himself into her one last time before unraveling and finally collapsing on top of her. The following morning the air was crisp, and the hints of Winter days was apparent. Draco took note of the, still sleeping, Astoria in his bed. He watched her chest rise and fall with every breath and noticed how the curls from her hair lay on her face. He took her hand and placed a light kiss on the top before swinging his legs off the bed.Draco waltzed into the kitchen to put on a pot of tea before she awoke, he glared out the window and knew it was the perfect day for a proposal. But as he was filling the kettle some doubts began to crawl to the front of his brain.Was he ready to be married at such a young age? Now, it was no secret that in the Wizarding World, particularly within pureblood families, people were married young, and bred children young, but did Draco want that life? Draco was only twenty years old, but he felt as if he has lived a hundred years. The young wizard sat with his steaming tea at the kitchen table and took note of an enchanted photograph that sat on a corner end table. The photo was of Astoria sitting at her artists’ easel on a bright summer’s morning. It was one of Draco’s favorite pictures of her. Astoria’s smile lit up the frame, along with his world. Draco decided that his age was but a number, that it would not affect the way he still wanted to marry the girl in his bedroom.If Draco was to make Astoria his wife, then he would be bound to her until he took his final breath. That would mean sticking by her side when the Dark Lord summons her or takes a punishment for her when she disobeys him. Draco’s soul purpose would be to protect her against all odds, which has generally been doing since before he met her.It was no longer a question if Draco wanted to propose to Astoria because the answer was always clear. She would always be bound to him because she was his soulmate. He knew that now.It was settled. Draco would propose sometime today, and he will make it the best damn proposal anyone had ever seen—“Good morning.” Astoria said in a sleepy tone followed by a yawn.“I can do this.” Draco thought to himself as he watched his soon-to-be fiancé pour herself some tea.The couple spent most of their day lounging about and discussing the plots of their most recent reads. Draco enjoyed reading Alchemy books and the occasional adventure story. Astoria was a lover of romance and mystery, she loved a great enemy to lovers’ story, the irony was cruel.Astoria announced that she wanted to spend some time at her easel before winter officially arrived, and it would be too cold to sit outside. Draco wrapped his girl in his cloak that had a warming charm in it and dismissed her.Draco watched her concentrate on her brush strokes and at the attention to detail. Astoria enjoyed sitting at the bottom at one of the nearby mountains to catch the view of the sunrise/sunset. He also noticed her taking several hits of her cigarette, Astoria tried to kick the habit, but for the life of her she could not. So, Draco made her promise to only smoke when she was alone outside. Draco noticed a few snowflakes falling from the sky, and in this moment, he felt the tiny ring in his pocket. He pulled it out and regarded it. “Please, let her say yes…” He thought to himself.Draco pulled on a cloak himself and traveled down to where his beautiful woman was. He noticed she was painting a landscape view of the bottom of the mountain. Snowflakes fell through the air the more steps he took, and every inch he traveled the harder his heart began to beat.“It looks divine.” Draco said lowly from behind her.Astoria, keeping her eyes on the canvas, agreed softly. She continued to dance her brush to add details to the flowers that lined in the grass. “I cannot seem to get the detail of this flower just right.”Draco hummed and began to lightly massage her shoulders and he kissed the top of her head. Draco spun her around slowly and connected their lips. Astoria gave him a warm smile, and he took both her hands in his, before beginning to speak.“Astoria Greengrass…you mean everything and more to me…I first started falling in love with you when you stomped on my foot in the common room…” Draco and Astoria began to laugh with one another.When Astoria first transferred to Hogwarts the old Slytherin gang gathered in the common to play a muggle game. Draco and Astoria ended up alone together, and Draco spat some insults in her face regarding Cedric and she ultimately stomped on his foot and spat in his face. Draco did not know why… but he knew in that very moment she was never going to leave his mind.Draco was beginning to get more nervous the more he spoke. He needed to calm down, steady his breathing and focus on the woman in front of him.He finally dropped to his one knee and Astoria instantly began to tear up. He watched one tear roll down her cheek.“I—I know there are obstacles…but I am willing to charge through them all if you are by my side…would you please do me the honor of becoming my wife?”There was mere silence for what felt like an eternity. Astoria could not stop her crying but buried beneath the tears cracked a large smile. She instantly yelled out, “Yes! Good Gods yes!” Astoria flung herself into Draco’s arms and connected their lips.Within the kissing Draco forgot a vital part of the proposal, the damn engagement ring.“Oh shit, erm—wait.” Draco reached into his pocket and pulled out the tiny ring and placed it onto her left ring finger.Astoria gushed at its beauty, but suddenly looked at Draco’s own hand, and back at her ring. She was putting the pieces together.“It is gorgeous!” She stared down at the ring. “Draco, where did you get this?”Draco chuckled and entwined his hand in hers. “I decided to place my most prized possession onto my greatest achievement.”Astoria gushed and kissed his lips passionately. Draco embraced his fiancé in his arms and squeezed her tightly.“Oh, my Gods, Theo and Pansy are going to go crazy! We need to owl them!” Astoria exclaimed boldly.The couple immediately wrote to their best friends and spent their night in front of the fireplace reading the great love stories of their time. As they were almost asleep in one another’s arms Draco felt a burning sensation on his left forearm, and Astoria jolted awake.She began to clutch onto the back of her neck, as Draco did the same with his arm that contained the Dark Mark. Draco knew the burning sensation meant a summons for the Death Eaters, but Draco had no wand to apparate.If he did not heed the Dark Lord’s summons, then he would be labeled a coward of the High Council. Astoria looked frightened because normally she did not feel the burning sensation on the back of her neck, but her runic imprint acted like a Dark Mark.“What do we do?” Astoria asked lowly.The only safe way for them to travel magically was through the floo fireplace, and their only connected fireplace was in Nott Manor. Astoria and Draco had no choice.The couple clipped on their cloaks and one by one stepped into the fireplace. The green flames filled the air, and Draco stepped through the fireplace in Theo’s transportation room.“What is it, mate? What are you doing here?” Theo inquired quickly.Draco furrowed his brows and held out his forearm exposing the Dark Mark, which was now black as coal and was slowly dancing on his skin. Theo looked confused and began to look at his own arm, but nothing was happening on his.“You don’t feel it?” Draco asked cautiously.Draco looked behind him and noticed that Astoria had not stepped through the floo yet. She was right behind him when he stepped through the flames. Draco gave her another minute before he attempted to floo back to the Nott safehouse, but the fireplace seemed to have a magical hold on the floo network. Draco was forbidden to travel back through the fireplace, leaving Astoria alone on the other side.

  2000
Astoria was preparing herself for the quick journey by gathering some floo powder in her hands, and standing within the transporting fireplace.“Nott Manor!”Astoria closed her eyes and awaited the green flames to fill her surroundings, but nothing happened. Perhaps she did not speak clear enough? She cleared her throat and tried once more.“NOTT MANOR!”Astoria scoffed and realized that nothing was happening. The fireplace must be locked, but it could not have been since Draco floo’d seconds before Astoria attempted.The young witch paced around the living room and racked her brain on why the floo would be locked, then she wondered if Draco traveled safely to Theo’s floo.Astoria did not have her wand to apparate, and without the use of the floo network there was no use of transportation. Draco’s broomstick was in the back room, perhaps she could fly? Astoria was never too keen on flying but this could be an emergency. She grabbed the broomstick and raced outside to witness an unexpected guest standing at the foot of the wards.“Hello, Astoria.” Nagini said with her hands clasped at her front.Astoria held onto the broomstick tightly and tried to act as if nothing was amiss. Pretend she was taking the broom out for a ride.Why would Nagini be here? If the Dark Lord was summoning the Death Eaters, then she should be at his side, currently, but she was here. Nagini wanted Draco out of the house so she could speak with Astoria in private, which could be the explanation for the floo being locked.“Nagini! What a pleasant surprise.” Astoria trotted down leading at the barrier of the wards. “What brings you here this evening?”Nagini laughed lowly and began to gaze around the property. Astoria felt her palms beginning to clam, and her anxiety beginning to build. Nagini was the closest person in command with her Master. If Nagini was sent to the safehouse, then it must be for important measure.“You’re living a wonderous life aren’t you, Astoria?” Nagini said in a sarcastic tone.Astoria shifted in her stance and nodded. “Draco and I are quite happy, yes.”In truth, Astoria had not thought much about her previous life with her Master after she arrived at the safehouse. There was an abundance of happiness, that it clouded her unhappy thoughts.Nagini nodded and pulled out her wand to twirl between her fingers, suddenly her gaze down to Astoria’s fingers, and her eyes widened. “I see we are attempting marriage once again. Such a tragedy what happened at your last wedding, what a disaster! Perhaps, this time you will actually get to marry the man. Hopefully, this time it will not rain, and you won’t have too--” Nagini said with a chuckle.Astoria rolled her eyes and did not want to banter with this distant relative of hers, but she could not hold her tongue. “If you are here to mock me then you are free to leave.”Astoria attempted to walk away but Nagini called out. “Oh, now, wait a minute. I came here as a favor to the Dark Lord…” Nagini crossed her arms and planted her weight on her hip, with a smug expression. “He is angry Astoria…When did your Master give you permission to leave England and shack up in this little love nest?”Astoria felt her blood begin to boil. She was exhausted of people telling her where she could not go or what she could not go. Even though she has told herself countless times in the past that she was tired of being ordered, perhaps this time would be different. This past year with Draco had been a dream come true, and she was not ready for it to end. Astoria wanted to spend her mornings and nights with the man she loved, not the man (or creature) she was owned by.“I am DONE being his property! Have him place his runic imprints on somebody else because I am done. I want out of the High Council, and I want release from the contract my parents placed me under before I was born. I---I cannot do this any longer!” Astoria bellowed out with anger in her heart, fear in her eyes but passion in her voice. She knew she was safe on the right side of the blood wards, but she had forgotten that anyone of her bloodline may cross the wards…Nagini stomped across the ground, past the wards, wand pointed at Astoria’s heart. The young witch stood her ground, wandless, but ready for a fight.“You deserve nothing! You will never be released! There is no such thing as being released from his grasp! The Dark Lord lives within us, darling! Do you honestly believe he will grant your wishes without gaining something in return?” Nagini placed the wand under Astoria’s chin and smiled.“Grant him a child, Astoria.” She said lowly. Astoria shook her head and continued to do so. “Give the Dark Lord what he needs. Youth grants youth. Your friend Lilla understood that, or she did after we erm---persuaded her.” Nagini knew in that moment she had spoken too much, and she placed her hand over her mouth.Astoria’s eyes widened, in a moment she seized hold of Nagini’s wand and pointed it at the dark witch. “Where the fuck is Lilla? What have you bastards done to her!”Astoria felt her hand shaking from the amount of rage that was surging through her body. She had already felt immense shame for leaving her best friend, and not being able to retrieve her, but this pushed her over the edge. Astoria wanted answers about Lilla, and she was going to get them even if she had to pull out all the stocks.“I do not have to tell you a thing—”Without thinking, Astoria lunged at the witch and snatched her wand. She pointed the wand at Nagini’s head and muttered the spell, “Legilimens!” Astoria got flung into Nagini’s memories and inside she saw the last moments she (Nagini) had with Lilla.
  “Come on Mrs. Dolohov, you can do this! He is almost out!” The healer said while ducking her head between Lilla’s legs.

  “Gods, fucking Merlin, get it OUT!” Lilla screamed. 

  “There we are. You have done it, Mistress. It’s a boy.” The healer exclaimed loudly. 

  Nagini strut into the room and clapped her hands softly. “Well done. The Dark Lord will be pleased with your service.” Nagini attempted to pull the child from Lilla’s arms, but she swiped her hands away. 

  “Get the fuck off me, snake bitch. This is my son. I broke from the imperious curse the moment I went into labor, now this is MY child. You will not take him!” Lilla said while clutching the newborn to her chest. 

  Nagini rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. “Do not make me call the Dark Lord. I am sure he will be more than pleased to yank that bloody bastard from your arms.” 

  Lilla began to cry harder than she ever has, her hands shook around her son, and she held him close. Nagini tried once more to grab the child, but Lilla bit her hand. 

  “Crazy cunt!” Nagini exclaimed while slapping Lilla across the cheek causing her to sway, and the baby to cry. 

  With Lilla being disoriented for half a moment, Nagini swiped the child from her arms. Lilla tried to crawl across the bed in attempts to retrieve her son, but she was much too weak.

  “NO! Please, Gods I am begging you. He is my son; I am begging you. Do not take him. Take me, take my soul, please, spare my child!” Lilla whaled while crying hysterically. 

  Nagini held the child in her arms and kissed its forehead. She could feel the youth vibrating off this newborn, and knew he was the perfect specimen for her Lord. 

  “You are much too old, Mrs. Dolohov. You can always try for another.” Nagini whipped out her wand from her waistband and disapprated from the room.

  Lilla was left on her bed whaling, and crying while being in the arms of the healer. She cried for her son and cried until the nightfall.
Astoria got flung from Nagini’s mind and was jolted back so far, she nearly fell to her knees.“I need to end this. I am done being tethered to a beast.” Astoria thought to herself.The young witch needed to clear her mind, and not allow her emotion to cloud her judgment. With the aid of Nagini’s wand, she clutched it tight, and allowed for her occlumency walls to build.Suddenly, everything she was thinking about became clear, the picture was revealing itself. Nagini was the enemy, her Master was the enemy. The Death Eaters were no longer her support system, for they must be put to an end.Astoria held the wand at Nagini who cowered on the ground and made pleading remarks.“Please…please…Astoria do not harm me. I am your family.”Astoria cocked her head and smirked. “You should be kissing my feet, little snake. Thanks to my power you no longer suffer the fate of being a maledictus.” She spat while Astoria enjoyed watching this woman cower at her knees.“Yes...yes. I owe you my life…it is your efforts that allowed me to take my place next to my Lord once more…” Nagini jumped to her feet and seized her wand from Astoria’s hand causing her to falter backward. “You are going to fulfill your task that the Dark Lord bids of you.”Nagini seized Astoria by the arm.
  Crack. 
Astoria realized that she had been apparated into a library. She knew these walls all to well, she was back in Malfoy Manor.“Hello dear.” A blood curdling voice said from behind.“I want to leave.” Astoria spat with the emotionless aid of her occlumency walls. She would always be grateful to Draco for teaching her how to use Occlumency properly.It has been an immense help when trying to deceive those who make her skin crawl.“Now…why would you want to leave me?” Voldemort said as he peered into the young witch’s eyes, his eyes began to scan the changes in her hair. “I don’t like it.” He spat.Astoria rolled her eyes. “It does not matter to me anymore, what you like or what you do not like. I am done being your slave.” She growled with her stance bold, and her expression cold.“Have I not given you all you desire, my sweet? I have offered you power, love, and the ability to stand at the side of the most powerful wizard that ever lived, me.” Voldemort spat coldly. “I even allowed you a solid year to live in harmony with your love.”Astoria shifted in her stance, but she needed to keep her emotions at bay to keep the occlumency walls stable. Not being able to use wand magic these past months have put a damper on her magical strength, and any break in proper concentration could be detrimental.“This is not the life I desire—”Voldemort connected his hand with Astoria’s cheek and released a powerful slap. She almost lost her footing, but she regained her balance. Astoria’s cheek burned to the touch, and she felt anger arising from inside of her.“I saved your life, little witch! It is lucky for you that your lifeline is connected to mine. If it were not, you would have died that day at the hands of those blood traitors, the Order of the Phoenix.”Astoria knew that if the blood magic had not connected her to Lord Voldemort’s spirit the day Alastor Moody cursed her to death, she would not have been revived. But the replica of the diary had been destroyed when Astoria’s substitutional lifeline had been killed. She never got around to letting Draco know that if Lord Voldemort is destroyed, her spirit is linked with his.The only way to true freedom was to be released from her services, but Astoria always knew deep down that he would never let her go.“I would have rather died that day.” She spat in his face.Voldemort seized the witch by strapping her against the wall with tethers from his robes. The silk material held her place and began to constrict her airway. Voldemort stood inches from her face.“You belong to me. You should be thanking me for allowing you to spend time with young Draco in that house of yours. Did you expect it to last forever?”The Occlumency walls crashed down in her mind, her emotions came flooding back, Astoria’s mind became overwhelmed and without hesitation she burst into tears. All the pain, suffering and anguish she has felt about her Master was being pushed to the front of her mind.“I—I---” Astoria stuttered and tried desperately to catch her words, but the anxiety was forbidding her to form proper sentences.Voldemort seized her by the hand and noticed the ring that laid on her left ring finger. He gave her a mocked smile and peered into her eyes.“I see there should be no issues in fulfilling my request then?”Astoria knew that he was referring to the request he made of her some time ago, regarding her first child. She never told Draco about the deal she made with the Dark Lord, but Astoria had no choice. She could not allow for Granger to be harmed by Voldemort, so he made his request, Astoria accepted. The first child she bared, would belong to him.It struck Astoria’s mind that in that moment she had not thought about Hermione Granger for months. She wondered what she was doing, if she was happy or grateful for what Astoria did for her. Granger may have been in love with Draco, but she did not deserve to be handed over to the Dark Lord.Astoria never intended on having children after that point of the original discussion. She hoped Lord Voldemort would give up his efforts in waiting for her to have a child. How could she be so naïve?“I cannot offer you, what you request anymore.” She spat.Lord Voldemort summoned a pensieve from his cabinet, pulled a memory from his head and signaled for Astoria to dip her head in the pool.Astoria cautiously dipped her head into the pool of memories and found herself falling into a dark lit room. There were not many decorations, but all things needed for survival were apparent.Suddenly, a woman from the outside was tossed into the room and Lord Voldemort stomped inside with her. It was Lilla.“What have you done to my child you bastard!” Lilla exclaimed while trying to lunge herself at the Dark Lord.Voldemort lifted his finger lightly and she was tossed against the wall.“I thank you, Lilliana for your service. The youth from your child has granted me five years of life.”Lilla lifted her head and spat at the Dark Lord’s face, he connected his hand with her cheek, Lilla’s head smacked onto the ground.“You will stay in this room until your friend, Astoria, has produced. That might be years Lilliana… you may want to use this time as reflection… if she does not produce…then I shall be forced to make other arrangements.” Voldemort growled at the woman cradled on the floor.Astoria felt her chest begin to heave, she wanted to run to Lilla’s side and hold her close.“Tori will never give you what you want!”Voldemort laughed and smirked at the young witch. “Then it shall be you who produces again…and again…and yet again…until I am at a full lifeline.”Lilla cradled her head in her knees and cried into her palms. Astoria felt this woman’s pain, how badly she wanted to grab her by the arm and disapparate, but she was not actually in the room with her. It was all but a memory from Voldemort’s head.“Antonin will never allow it!” Lilla shouted.“As a matter of fact, this was all his idea. Dolohov was proud to offer his young, fruitful wife as service to me.”Lilla cried silently and her eyes widened.As Astoria was about to rush across the room, she felt herself being pulled from the memory. When she blinked, she found herself standing at the foot of the pensieve.Neither Voldemort, nor Astoria could fathom a word in the first few moments. It appeared the Dark Lord wanted her to say something first, but she knew the only thing she could say—“Allow me some time.” She said lowly. Voldemort cocked his head and signaled for her to continue. “I ask is not a word is breathed to Draco about this, and I want Lilla released. How can I buy myself time?”Astoria had half a mind to request Lilla be taken to Nott Manor, so she could be cared for by Pansy and Theo, but she decided it might not be best to drag the Nott’s into her mess. They have already risked for much for Draco and Astoria.Voldemort smiled and cradled her face in his hands. She felt the cold touch of his hands, and she wanted to look anywhere else in the room, but into his deceitful red eyes.“For every year you make me wait, I take a year off of your life, but be advised girl, every time I take time off your life, your body begins to weaken.” Voldemort growled.Astoria felt her mind race at ten times its original speed. She had already made this deal once before, but they never discussed the logistics. How much time was she willing to sacrifice off her life? Was she able to lie to her fiancé and produce a child under false pretense?Astoria nodded and felt a single hot tear roll down her cheek. “How will you do that?”Voldemort smiled, and suddenly he closed his eyes. Astoria felt nothing at first, until the next moment when it felt as if a fiery hot blade penetrated her belly. She was able to glance down, and nothing was stabbing her.Across her eyes she saw bright lights, the brightest she had ever seen. Then she felt dizzy as she heard a soft voice in her ear.
  “It’s okay sweetheart…let go—”
Astoria jolted herself back into reality and Voldemort looked as if he drank a fleets worth of unicorn blood. Astoria on the other hand felt mentally, and physically drained. Like a dementor had tried to suck out happy memories…“Thank you, my dear.” Voldemort said as he placed a soft kiss upon her hand. “Your time limit is five years. If you do not produce within the time window I have provided, I shall make Lilliana’s not worth living.”“Fuck you. What did you do to me?” Astoria said breathlessly as she tried to shake her head back to normal.“Youth begets youth.” Voldemort purred. “Nagini will escort you home now. Stay safe, ‘Victoria’”Astoria scowled at him for using her muggle cover name, but she felt so weak she could not say a mean quip.Astoria returned home and stumbled back into the safe house. She felt her world begin to shake around her, and how desperately she wanted her Occlumency walls up and her wand back. But she needed to think about Draco’s safety first against the Ministry.She could not stop thinking about Lilla and what she was going through. Would Lilla be angry with her by not producing for the Dark Lord right away? Would she be relieved that Astoria was standing her ground, but it costed years off her life in the process?Many emotions were flooding through her mind and all she wanted—The floo fireplace lit up in green flames and a tall, dark, pale figure stepped through it.“Draco.” Astoria said lowly while flinging herself in his arms.“What the devil happened? Are you alright?” He asked while she kept her grip on him tight.Astoria wanted so badly to spill her heart out on the floor and release all her demons. She needed to vent everything out, but she could not tell Draco about what had happened that night.She had five years. Plenty of time to build the courage and explain to Draco what had been eating away at her mind, and body. Astoria thought about what the Dark Lord meant that her body would weaken from him draining her youth. Would she still be the same person?

  2000
Draco clipped on his cufflinks and regarded himself in the mirror, he looked exceptionally fine today, he thought to himself.He heard a knock at the door and tilted his head to witness Theo poking inside.“Mate, she is ready. The Portkey is set up for her in a secluded area, and arrival point is miles away from the safehouse.”Draco nodded and padded Theo on the shoulder. He had planned a surprise for his fiancé and hoped that nothing bad will come of this kind gesture. After all, every bride deserves to be surrounded by support on the first day of their rest of her life.“I greatly appreciate you doing this for me. I cannot wait to see the look on Astoria’s face.” Draco said with hope.The first wedding Draco held with Astoria was beautiful, but the most important aspect did not happen, the actual marriage ceremony. Auror’s ambushed the ceremony and Draco was forced to flee the scene with Astoria. However, this time around he was determined in perfecting every detail.Draco and Astoria had their ups and downs, but when it came down to it, they always chose one another.The Scotland winter was beautiful. Snow covered the ground, along with sparkles when the sun glared over the land. Some of the fondest memories Draco has as an adolescent was exploring Hogwarts’ grounds during winter. He was often accompanied by Crabbe or Goyle, but after he met Theo in his third year the other two drifted away.When Draco and Theo were in their fourth year, preparing for the Yule Ball, the two wizards sat near the Black Lake to sneak peaks at the Beauxbaton Carriage, just hoping for one of the lovely ladies to pop out.
  “Do you reckon that pretty little blonde is in their? Primping her cheeks or powdering her nose?” Theo asked while handing Draco a small flask. “Mate, I would give my left pinky for a taste of her—” 

  Draco scoffed and nearly choked on the flask. “Are you talking about that bobble-head, Astoria? I do not understand how you find her attractive.” Draco spat while taking a slug. 

  Theo laughed and nudged his friend. “I can just see it, ya’ wanker. She moves differently than the rest, and carries herself differently, plus she is easy on the eyes, and have you seen her arse? Quite fine for a girl her age.” 

  Draco rolled his eyes and did not take his eyes off the beautiful carriage that sat no more than a hundred meters from him. He wondered if the ladies were jabbing about local news, or whether their bum looked exquisite in their evening gown. Now, he was thinking about the mental little blond witch who he had not often paid much mind too, until this moment. Was she inside getting fitted for her gown or was she in the castle waiting for her date? Who was her date? Would she be accompanied by a slimy Durmstrang git or a Hogwarts prat? In that moment, Draco remembered he had to accompany Pansy to the ball. He let out a long sigh, and knew it would be a long Christmas Eve…

  “Then talk to her later if you fancy her so much.” Draco spat with a hint of jealousy in his tone. 

  “You know, mate? That little witch would not look too shabby with you. She is pureblood after all, I am sure your parents would—” 

  “Enough. You know the situation I am in.” Draco interjected. 

  “Mate, you know I will always support your decisions, but eventually you are going to regret messing around with that mudblood—”

  “Nott. I would advise you to shut it.” Draco said as he was about to make an exit, but Theo grabbed his shoulder. 

  “Forgive me. I was merely trying to display options. You never know what your future might hold. It may entail a certain late night with a gorgeous blonde witch…” Theo said with hints of intent. 

  “I cannot see myself with a witch like Astoria Greengrass. She seems too self-entitled...”
Draco snapped his eyes back to reality and chuckled lowly to himself at remembering such an interesting memory, and how wrong he was at the time. Here he was, nearly six years later, about to marry the girl inside that sat inside the Beauxbaton carriage all those years ago.“Is Pansy getting her ready?” Draco asked while clasping the dress robes.Theo nodded and handed Draco a fire whisky shot.“Cheers.”
  Clank.
“May your future be filled with love, and endless blowjobs.” Theo said playfully.
  Clank.
“Nott, I erm---I wanted to discuss something with you. It is a matter of importance.”Both wizards sat in nearby armchairs, and it took several moments for Draco to cough up the confidence to have such a difficult discussion with his best friend.Draco was fully committing his life to Astoria and as a husband, he would need to put her well-being before his own.“What’s on your mind?” Theo said while furrowing his brows.“I reckon the Ministry is going to search for my arse until I am my Father’s age, I cannot run from them forever. I need your word that you will protect Astoria if I am ever captured. She is all that matters anymore...”Draco did not want to think about the consequences of what could happen if the Ministry caught him one day. Would he be put to death or be sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban? He did not know which seemed worse, but if he were put to death, Astoria would be alone in the world. Draco could never forgive himself if he did not make protective arrangements for her. The first step to being a good husband, protect your wife, and prepare for the future.Theo lowered his head and stared into his whisky glass, but finally glared up at his best friend.“I have said it before, mate. You and Astoria are our family. I protect my family.” Theo held up his whisky class and clanked.Draco felt more at ease knowing that Theo would protect Astoria if anything ever happened to him. The Nott’s were family to them as well.“There is a matter of my own that I need to discuss with you while the girls are pre-occupied.” Theo fell silent for a moment. “The Dark Lord is working on building his forces back up, after the Battle at Hogwarts many of his followers slipped away. If the Dark Lord wishes to go to war, then he expects you and I to be in leading ranks.”Draco scoffed and tried hard to gather his thoughts. He knew the day he received the Dark Mark that he was doomed to serve the Dark Lord, but the only question was time. How much time would he have before the Dark Lord starts a full-blown war, and would the resistance be able to strike before the Dark Lord makes his move? Would the Order of the Phoenix be opened to coordinating with a Death Eater who betrayed his master? Surely, it would not hurt to ask.Both wizards took one more fire whisky shot and bantered for a few more minutes before it was finally time.“Let’s get ya’ hitched finally, you slippery git.” Theo said with a smack on Draco’s shoulder.**“I can hardly breathe, Pans. I think I am more nervous for this wedding than my last.” Astoria said while keeping a hand on her chest.“That is excitement you’re feeling. This time all that matters is you and Draco. You will have Theo and I right there to support you.” Pansy embraced her friend tightly and had the bride spin around.Astoria felt more beautiful in this simple wedding dress than she had felt in her last wedding gown. The last gown was extravagant and was fitting for a wedding of elegance. This dress had long-sleeves, a laced-up neckline, and a touch of beading around the seams.The young witch found her dress in a vintage shop in one of the nearby villages. The store clerk even told her she would look ravishing in such a frock, and in this moment Astoria could not have agreed more.This wedding would be the celebration she would remember until the day she took her last breath. The snow falling outside, the shimmers of the coated ground, and the cool breeze kissing her cheeks.“It’s nearly time. Are you ready?” Pansy inquired while draping a cloak over herself.Was she ready? The last time she knew she was ready, but this time was different. There was no Lucius walking her down the aisle (thank Gods), and there was no Narcissa snarking at her every step she took. This time it was only her, Draco, the Nott’s, and the mountains. The sound of the wind in her ears, and the feeling of Draco’s hand with hers is all she desired.Astoria clasped on her white cloak and glared at herself in the mirror. She lowered her head and fixed a nearby book that had fallen, it was a fictional muggle novel. 
  Astoria hurried her books into her satchel and ran out of the carriage to make it to her Muggle Studies class. She was quite interested in this week’s topic, the different ways muggles wed. She thought to herself, “It cannot be much different from the way magical folk marry, can it?” 

  Astoria fixed her pale blue cape before she walked into the class, it must had been her heels because the moment she walked in all eyes went on her. She gave everyone a small, embarrassed smile, and found her seat. It was a tad awkward at first being the only Beauxbaton attending a Muggle Studies class, but she quickly got over it once the lessons started.

  As she was preparing her quills and parchment a small note flitted in front of her. She peered up and noticed the Malfoy boy smirking at her, typical prat. The note read, 

            “Late again bobble-head? Should I transfigure your quill into a time-turner?” 

  Astoria crumpled the paper and tossed it into the nearby bin. Little prat, calling her late, it was not her fault. The Beauxbaton dorms were located inside the carriage that was located next to the gamekeeper’s hut. She could only walk so fast, and apparition was nearly impossible on Hogwarts grounds. Reasons? Unknown. Why were Hogwarts people so cautious with apparition?

  Professor Burbage started the lesson with discussing how muggles have different religions. Some are Christian and some are Jewish. There were so many religions! However, she found one topic most interesting, and it happened right here in Scotland in the olden days. 

  “When two Scots were in love and had no officiate to perform the marriage, they would perform a handfast ceremony. Which entails some blood and layers of ribbon. The couple would tie their hands and repeat, ‘Blood of my Blood—” 

  Astoria found her gaze off the professor, and it wandered over to her left side where the platinum hair caught her eye. She peered over her shoulder and noticed Malfoy’s eyes locked on her. Why was he staring at her? Did he always stare at her like this? 

  It seemed like minutes, but it was only seconds. As she was listening to Burbage’s discussion about handfasting her eyes were on the Malfoy boy. She could not deny it, but his eyes were intoxicating. She wondered what it would feel like to have those eyes stare into hers. Would she feel as she did in this moment? It was childish to think such things, he probably was already matched with another. 

  Astoria flicked her blond hair to the side, and tried her hardest to concentrate on Burbage, but now that she felt his eyes, it was all she wanted to focus on. 
Astoria’s eyes snapped back to reality, and she smiled. She was ready, she gave Pansy a nod.Pansy placed the veil overtop Astoria’s face and held out her hand to apparate them to the ceremony point. Astoria missed having her wand to apparate, she had hope that in the next few months Theo would allow her and Draco to do wand magic again. But for now, for the safety of their muggle identities, it was best to stick to wandless magic.The couple felt it best not to hold the ceremony near the safehouse. A change of scenery was needed for such a joyous occasion. Draco and Astoria decided on a hilltop that was secluded from the village that sat miles away. Theo placed a slight warming charm over the perimeter so nobody would freeze to death (Scotland winters are not to be trifled with).Astoria opened her eyes to witness a shimmering archway that overlooked a table that held a blade, and some gold ribbon. Candles trailed up to the archway, and even though it was snowing they remained ablaze. She noticed the sun in the corner of her eye almost set, and the snow falling just the right amount. Astoria felt the flakes kiss her hand, and the wind flow through the strands of her hair.Draco stood in the middle of the archway with snowflakes sticking to his new jet-black hair, and a smile splashed across his cheeks. His dress robes fit him perfectly, and his black cloak made him the epidemy of elegance. Draco always dressed for perfection, and she adored him for it.To Astoria’s surprise there was another figure standing near the archway. As Pansy walked her further, the unknown person became clearer and clearer until suddenly, the person became known.“Daphne?” Astoria croaked out almost bursting into immediate tears.Daphne walked over and held out her hand. “Hello big sis.”Astoria hugged her sister tightly and felt like her heart lifted into the air. She had not seen Daphne since before her last wedding when she was planning Hermione’s escape. But how did she get here? How did she even know Astoria was planning on getting married (again?)?“What are---are you doing here?” Astoria said breathlessly.She could barely form words because she was speechless. Astoria wanted to latch onto her little sister and never let her go, how she missed her dearly. She dares say, she missed her more than her own parents. Would this mean Daphne has forgiven Astoria for everything she has done unwillingly (and some willingly) for the Dark Lord? Could it mean a fresh start for the Greengrass sisters?“I was invited by your fiancé.” Both girls glared at the gorgeous groom who stood in the archway. “I am here to walk you down the aisle. If I may?”Astoria nodded as quick as she could, and linked arms with her little sister. Daphne and Astoria glided down the walkway lined with the candles, and she witnessed the smile of the Nott’s, and her glorious fiancé at the end. The two girls walked down the aisle of snow and Daphne gave her sister a kiss on the cheek and clasped her hand with Draco’s. Draco gave Daphne a tight nod.“Take care of her…like I failed too...” Daphne revealed while lowering her head.“I promise.” Draco said firmly while enclosing his hand with Astoria’s.Astoria never felt that Daphne failed her, but it was she who failed Daph. That was her little sister and she sent her away after her capture, but she was not little anymore. Daphne was a member of The Order, and almost a fully matured woman. Astoria could only imagine what The Order members must think if they knew Daphne was attending the wedding of her Death Eater big sister. Oh well, damn them all. None of them mattered in this moment. Plus, Astoria was still not to keen on Order member’s since they tried to execute her in Portofino.“I love you.” Astoria whispered to Daphne.Draco held onto Astoria’s hands and glared into her eyes.Astoria had her family, friends, and the man she loved in the same vicinity. She was going to enjoy this moment for as long as she could.The Handfasting ceremony was going to start. Handfasting is commonly used in Scotland when there is no officiant for a ceremony. They decided since they are pretending to be a Scottish newlywed couple, might as well officiate their marriage in a traditional Scottish way. Plus, there was no officiate member of the Ministry to perform a legal marriage, so a handfast would have to do.Draco’s eyes glared into Astoria’s, and she could not help but to smile as large as she could. His eyes felt intoxicating, and he was all hers, until their last day. Her cheeks began to hurt from smiling so largely, but she did not care. Her face expressed her emotion.Draco picked up the blade from the table and slit a small incision on his wrist and proceeded to do the same with Astoria’s. The two overlapped their blood dripped wrists and repeated.“Blood of my blood. Bone of my bone. I give you my body, that we two might be one. I give you my spirit until our life is done.”Theo walked up and tied the gold ribbon around the couple’s hands and they each took a turn in exclaiming their own vows. The sting from the ribbon on Astoria’s cut on her wrist should have bothered her more, but all she could focus on was the man who stood bonded to her.“I, Astoria Greengrass, vow to cherish, love, and honor you, Draco Malfoy until I take my last breath on Earth. I vow to protect you from harm and stand by your side as your partner in life.” Astoria said boldly.Astoria felt her heart leap at the sound of her vows, but she felt more excited to listen to Draco’s vows to her.“I, Draco Malfoy, vow to worship you until my soul is pulled from my body. You are the only woman I want to see in my bed for the rest of my days. I vow to keep you safe to the best of my ability, and never let you forget how loved you are.”Theo tightened the ribbon around the couples’ wrists and once the vows were completed the Handfasting ceremony was concluded. The ribbons fell off their hands and Draco pulled Astoria in for a long and passionate kiss. She felt his tongue slide into her mouth, and he cupped her face. Astoria slid her hands through his hair and felt deliriously in love.Draco and Astoria were Handfasted on a mountain in Scotland surrounded by the support of family and friends. All that mattered was the love they felt for each other.“Oh—I am so thrilled!” Pansy whaled out while pulling the couple in for a long hug. “My two best friends together at last!”Draco exchanged a firm handshake with Theo and walked over to chat with Daphne, arm linked with his bride.“I extend my gratitude for your attendance. You have made Astoria happier than I have seen her in a while.”Astoria squeezed her husbands arm tightly and smiled at her little sister.Daphne extended her hand hesitantly, but kept her facial expression secluded around Draco. Astoria knew that her sister was not an enormous fan of Draco, but she was happy they both kept their differences to the side momentarily.However, Draco murdered Albus Dumbledore and was hiding out in a safehouse in the Highlands. Daphne was a prime member of The Order; anything could happen when two sides of the war collide.The small reception celebration was being held at a pub in one of the nearby highly muggle populated towns. They all drank pints, exchanged interesting stories, and clanked their glasses to the newlyweds. Many muggles came to celebrate with the newlyweds by offering their luck, along with more pints!“Congratulation’s lad! She sure is a pretty one, huh?” One intoxicated muggle man said while smacking Draco on the shoulder.“Oi!! Las you sure got yourself a handsome laddy! I am sure you will not have troubles producing such beautiful bairnes!” Another muggle Scottish woman stated. Bairnes was the Scottish or old Gaelic language for baby.Astoria got up to use the loo when her sister accompanied her and had a low conversation with her.“I must return to the Portkey fairly soon. I have almost completed Healer training and Severus is expecting me back anytime now.”Astoria nodded and squeezed her sister’s hand. She noticed her sister said the name Severus, perhaps she slipped up. Astoria always knew Severus was not entirely on the Dark Lord’s side, but was he now a prime member of The Order? Interesting. Another topic to be discussed with Draco later.“I will be eternally grateful you showed up for me today. Even regarding my past actions, and behavior…You are my sister and I never stopped loving you.” Astoria embraced Daphne tightly.“Tori…I must confess I did not only come here for your wedding.” Daphne said while crossing her arms.Astoria cocked her head and blinked several times. What could Daphne want from Astoria? She has nothing to offer her except…“I came here because…The Order needs information, and we are working on a strike against the Dark Lord…now I know your allegiance is difficult but…”“Information Severus cannot obtain? Huh, fascinating. How can I help?” Astoria said firmly.It did not feel like a bomb was dropped on her, but a pleasant surprise. Astoria wanted badly for the Dark Lord to fall, especially now regarding what he is requiring from her. If The Order could kill Voldemort, then all her worries would be solved, but the task was tricky. Astoria’s soul was linked with Voldemort’s, and if he falls, she falls. A minor detail she does not need to worry about now.“Harry Potter was in the process of destroying horcrux’s before he was murdered. He believed that giant snake to be the final one… but it disappeared. Do you happen to know---?”“Her name is Nagini. It is because of me that she conquered her animal maledictus curse. She is the Dark Lord’s right hand. She is also our family, distantly...” Astoria interjected.Daphne nodded and began to pace around the loo, probably trying to conjure up words or rack her thoughts. Astoria felt like a lot was being placed on Daphne’s shoulders, who is running the tasks at The Order?“Family? Oh gods… Okay erm—uhm---” Daphne began to stutter but Astoria placed both her hands on her shoulders to try and calm her.“This needs to be done sooner rather than later. After the new year, I will devise a plan to kill Nagini. She is his Horcrux, her soul is bounded to him.” Astoria pinned back her brown hair out of her face and took a few deep breaths.Could she betray Nagini? Of course. Would she get in trouble for it? Not if she was not careful… This plan was precarious, if Astoria did not orchestrate every correct move for The Order, then Voldemort might hurt Lilla to punish Astoria. She could not let that happen. Astoria made a mental note to owl Severus to figure out which side of the war he is truly on… She needed time to think this through and discuss it with Draco. Get his input on the matter. After all, married couples are supposed to be a team. Astoria did not want to start her marriage off by lying to her husband.Astoria hugged her sister goodbye and informed her that after the new year she would send an owl explaining the plan, and if she had questions to reply by owl.When Astoria returned to the party, Draco was waiting for her with his hand out.“Care to dance?” He said quite cheeky with a smirk.Astoria bit her bottom lip and took his hand graciously with a small curtsy. “How can I say no?”Draco pulled her in promptly and held her close to his body. He swayed her across the dancefloor and lifted her into the air while kissing her passionately. Many muggles in the pub made whistling noises or clapped.“Do you remember the last time we danced?” Astoria asked while latching her arms around his head.“You mean when you were so taken aback by my dashingly good looks you nearly fainted? Yes.” He purred.Astoria jumped to her feet and placed a small peck on his lips. That was not exactly what happened when they first shared a dance, but close enough!After about three more songs, it was time to return to the safehouse. The Nott’s apparated the newlyweds back to the house and bid them adieu.**Draco picked up his bride swiftly and carried her into the house, princess style. Astoria kissed his lips, and she giggled every step he took.“Is this entirely necessary? It is not like we have never been in the house before…”Draco placed her onto the couch and tucked a piece of hair behind her head. How gorgeous she looked with the glow from the fire, the dampness of the snowflakes in her hair, and her cheeks red from blushing so much.“Haven’t you come to notice I am quite traditional, Mrs. Malfoy.” He growled against her lips.Draco cupped his bride’s face and pulled her forward, he began to pull the cloak off her body when she started to do the same for him. Astoria wrapped her legs around his torso and arched herself into Draco’s body.“You are finally mine.” He purred.Astoria stopped their kiss and glared into his eyes. Her big brown doe eyes always made him swoon for her more ever.“I was always yours.”Draco picked up Astoria and placed her gently on the floor and placed a pillow behind her head. He began to slide the dress off her shoulders, leaving a kiss with every inch he left bare.He tossed the white dress to the side, and he unbuttoned his shirt and did the same. Draco began to kiss around her neck, leaving small love bites, and listened to her breathing increase with every inch he explored with his lips.“I am going to show you…how sweet it is to have a husband like me.” Draco growled against her skin.In that moment, Astoria sat up and jumped on top of him. “No, I am going to show you how lucky you are to have me as your wife…”Astoria unbuttoned his trousers, and with every button undone Draco felt himself harden, and become more aroused. She was not even near his bare skin yet and he was already erect? Sometimes he was pathetic…Astoria pulled off his trousers and tossed them to the side. She put his hardened cock in her hands and began to lightly stroke.“Fucking, Merlin…I always loved how your hands felt…”Astoria giggled lowly and began to leave a trail of kisses up his length, until she began to twirl her tongue on the top of his cock.Draco had to think to himself not to bust almost immediately, but as he watched her pretty mouth on his tip it was nearly impossible.Without warning, Astoria shoved her mouth almost to the bottom of his cock, and nearly deep throated him entirely. She began to slowly cradle the rest of him in her hand and Draco felt her tongue glide up and down his cock.“Gods…you’re gorgeous…and you are all…fuck--...fucking mine.” Draco began to rake his hand through the strands of her hair and with every slurp noise she made, he felt he might unravel at any moment.After several pumps of her head on his cock, he was ready to dive deep into his wife. Draco picked up his witch and laid her back down on the floor. He kissed her lips passionately and nipped her bottom lip.He lined himself with her entrance, and he pumped his cock into her. She could not have been more wet or ready for him. Her insides cradled him like a warm, wet, hug.“Husband.” She purred against his mouth as he was inserting himself deeply into her.Draco smirked and kissed her lips. “Wife.” He purred.He could tell by her facial expression that she was inching close to her climax. Draco held both her hands above her and pumped himself into her as firmly as he could.Draco noticed her abdomen begin to tense and untense, and her insides began to tighten around his cock. Draco sped up his pace just enough for her to finish trough her climax, and he felt himself begin to unravel.The sweat began to drip off his forehead, and his cheeks felt like he was on fire, but nothing mattered more in this moment than the fact he was having an amazing wedding night.Draco gave Astoria one last thrust before he unraveled inside of her, and he clutched her close. He pulled her into his chest, and she left a small peck on his peck.After a few moments of silence and catching of breaths. Draco could feel himself drifting off to sleep until Astoria began to speak.“Is this a good time to discuss how I agreed to coordinate with The Order to kill Nagini?”Draco’s eyes snapped open, and he felt himself more awake than before. Was he dreaming? What did she say? Did she really just say—“You did what?”

  2001
“I forbid you to go.” Draco spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and proceeded to clasp the cloak around her neck. She knew why her husband was distraught. It was natural reaction to such a situation. Being the aid in destroying an all-powerful dark wizard is not an easy task, but steps must be taken, and sacrifices must be made.“I will not quarrel with you again, Draco. This has been the plan for months and there is no way—”Draco seized both her arms and held her in place, while connecting her gaze with his.“When we agreed to aid the bloody Order, I thought I made myself clear when I told them you were not to be—”Astoria shook her head and interjected. “I volunteered. I had to. I am the only one suitable for the task. Please understand.”Draco scoffed and let go of the grasp he had on his wife. Astoria wanted to get the task over and done with as soon as possible, so she could return to the safehouse. She knew that Draco understood that she was the only suitable witch to complete the task. It was why he was so angry because he did not want to face the truth.The pale wizard continued to pace around the room until he threw a glass against the wall, and watched it shatter into hundreds of shards. Astoria startled herself, and it only made her anxiety shoot through the roof. Draco was acting like a pouty child not getting his way, and it was time for him to put on his man trousers.“ENOUGH OF THIS!” She shouted. “You are to stop acting like a pathetic toddler and allow me to do this for the people I love.” Astoria walked forward and cupped her husbands distraught face. “Je te reviendrais.” I will come back to you. She said softly to him in French. Draco lowered his head onto her shoulder, and she embraced him tightly, and he wrapped his arms around her body. The feeling of his warmth sunk into her body and made her anxiety trickle down.“Promise me, you will return.” Draco murmured.Astoria glared into her husbands’ grey eyes and connected their lips. She gave him a soft smile and brushed her nose with his. Astoria kissed the inside of Draco’s wrist and whispered, “Le sang de mon sang.” Blood of my blood.“You cannot get rid of me that easily, darling.” She purred.Draco regarded his wife’s face and ran his fingers through the strands of her hair that peaked through her cloak hood. He let out a few low breaths and was about to say something until, the was a knock at the door. Astoria called for the guest to enter and the couple same to notice it was her sister, Draco seized his hand from her face immediately.“Oh—erm—hi. Tori, are you ready?” Daphne asked while keeping her arms crossed.Astoria nodded, she kissed Draco passionately once more before making her exit with her sister. There was a slight doubt in her heart that that may have been the last time she would kiss her husband. If everything goes to plan, that would not be the case, and she would be home before dawn.“I love you endlessly.” Astoria said lowly.Draco snorted and grazed her cheek with his thumb. “Ditto, Mrs. Malfoy.”Astoria walked and as she did her hand fell out of Draco’s, she connected their eyes one last time before she closed the front door. Her eyes met with the lunar beauty that sat in the sky, and the chilled Scotland air caressed her face.“Here is your wand.” Daphne said while handing Astoria her beloved wand. Even though Theo was not fully on board with this mission, he did agree that Astoria should not go into this mission without her wand.How she missed how it felt in her hand. The dragon heart string at its core, and rosewood that covered its frame. It has never failed her in her life, for she could feel the power of the wand radiating through its core.  “Do you think you can do this?”Astoria took a deep breath and nodded. She tapped the wand above her head and unraveled the identity charm that has been placed on her for some time. She would temporarily keep it off her, just until the task was complete. It would not do anyone good if none of the Wizards she encountered tonight did not know her, it was the gist of the plan. Who would be daft enough to cross with Voldemort’s precious one?Astoria felt her mind become lighter, and her saw at the corner of her eye the brown strands becoming blonde. She felt her eyes water, and felt more like herself in months, because now she did not look like “Victoria” the muggle, but she was Astoria once again. Astoria gripped onto her wand and felt the urge to cast dark magic, but she shoved that feeling back down to her very core. It was not who she was anymore. The dark witch that once corrupted her soul was gone forever, right?“Tori? Are you ready for this?” Daphne asked once more while glaring into her sisters’ eyes.It might have been in the moment, or maybe it was how the moon was shining onto Daphne, but it was at this moment that Astoria noticed how grown-up her little sister had become. She was no longer the Ravenclaw girl who was in love with Cedric Diggory, or the girl who humiliated her big sister for revenge. Daphne Greengrass was a woman who was determined to save the Wizarding World, no matter the cost. Astoria admired her strength, and ambition. However, Astoria still felt she was the prettier sister.“If you keep asking me if I am ready, I am going to change my mind.”Astoria had to close her eyes and locate where Nagini was before she could apparate to her location. She tilted her head back and connected her spirit with Nagini’s.She saw a dimly lit room, a fireplace, and a dining room table. It was not Malfoy Manor; the decorative style was strong. Astoria delve into her mind deeper to try and get a solid read, until she saw the emblem of the Dolohov Manor.Astoria held onto her sister’s arm and flicked her wand to apparate.
  CRACK. 
The Greengrass sisters apparated into what looked like the gardens of the estate. There seemed to be no wards on the exterior of the Manor, but she knew that Nagini was somewhere on the property. The question was, what was her exact location? It was time for Astoria to begin solo portion of the mission.“Wait for my signal. Apparate back for Weasley and wait for me here. You will know when to strike.” Astoria whispered.Daphne nodded and quickly embraced her sister tightly which caught Astoria off-guard, but welcomed her hug.“Be careful.” Daphne said cautiously.“Always.” Astoria reassured. “Now, go.”Instantly, Daphne disapparated before her eyes and now came for the part Astoria prepared herself for. She stood firmly on her feet and flipped her hair out from the cloak hood. It was now or never.The young witch waltzed up to the front gates of the Manor, and was greeted but none other, Theodore Nott Sr, Theo’s father. Astoria had to remind herself to remember who she was while in the premise of Death Eaters. She was their superior, their master’s precious one. Astoria wanted everything to remain as it was for the time being to conceal power. Afterall, magic is might.“Why, Miss. Greengrass. What a surprise? Please, allow me.” Nott Senior said while taking her by the hand and guiding her into the Manor. Astoria proceeded to unclasp her cloak and toss it into the older wizard’s hand.Astoria nodded with a smug facial expression and knew in this moment it would be best to keep her occlumency walls intact. With her wand in hand, it would be easier than it has been.With her emotions guarded by a wall of unbreakable steeled magic, she was welcomed into the Dolohov estate openly. She wondered why Nott Sr. would be at the Dolohov estate at this hour of night, but she did not want to seem overly curious.“Wait here.” Theo’s father said coldly.Astoria pursed her lips and rolled her eyes. She proceeded to stroll around the foyer and examined the different fixtures on the windows and walls. Astoria noticed her paintings she made for Lilla while in Italy but other than those the decorative style was quite tacky in her opinion. The estate was obviously not decorated fully by Lilla, if it were it would be wall to wall white carpets with emerald trim.“My, my, Astoria Greengrass or is it Malfoy now?” Antonin said with his arm extended to take hers. “I do extend my apologies for not making your wedding Astoria it was just—"Astoria took his hand willingly and he kissed her cheek. It almost pained her to keep a small smile across her face, but she had to remember, it was all part of the plan.“It is Mrs. Malfoy to you, Antonin.” Astoria spat with a smirk on her face.Dolohov’s face instantly fell, and a look of disgust came over him. “Indeed. How may I be of service on this fine evening?”Astoria tightened her gloves and glided her finger around the table in the middle of the room that held the pitiful white roses.“I require an audience with Nagini. Is she here?” She said while turning her head to scan the room in search for the snake lady.Antonin stared at his feet and shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid, Miss. Nagini is indisposed at the moment—”Astoria slapped her gloves on the table and stuck her wand under Antonin’s chin. “I suggest you produce her, Dolohov, before I make you wish you remained in your shit-stained cell in Azkaban.”Dolohov remained silent but shook in his stance. In a moment he yelled for his house elf.“TOPPER!”
  Crack.
“Master Dolohov called for Topper?”Antonin nodded. “Yes, I require Nagini. Tell her come to down.”Topper nodded, and disapparated.Astoria smiled and threw up her hands. “Now, see, was that so difficult?”Antonin walked two inches from Astoria’s face and scoffed. “You little bitch.” He spat.Astoria chuckled lowly to herself. She reached into her pocket, lit a cigarette between her lips and puffed smoke into his face. “The High Council turned me into a real cunt.” She spat back.She had almost forgotten what it felt like to have power in her hands. To have people fear you, rather than love you. The power that vibrated through her felt intoxicating, but she knew that is what the feeling of Dark Magic did to a witch. Once she had a taste, she would beg for more.To have the feeling of the worlds power at your fingertips is more than enough to drive any witch into the darkest parts of herself. One of Astoria’s greatest regrets was letting Dark Magic overpower herself when she set Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ablaze. She hopes one day, to make things right at that school. Afterall, it did bring her to Draco, therefor, she owes Hogwarts some peace.“Astoria? What pressing matter tears you away from your love shack this hour of night?” Nagini said from the top of the stairs. She was wearing silk black robes, while her black hair touched the bottom of her breast line.“Hello, Nagini. I need to discuss some important details regarding the…uprising....in private.” Astoria eyed Dolohov and raised her eyebrows in a snicker.Nagini traipsed down the stairs and looked at Astoria curiously for a moment.“There is something different about you…” Nagini said as she circled the young witch.Astoria dropped her cigarette onto the marble floor, and smushed it with her foot. “Could it be the hair? Last time you saw me I had that awful shit color.” She said while holding out strands of her blonde hair.Nagini looked into her eyes for a moment more, but Astoria kept a soft smile across her face.“Must be.” Nagini said lowly.“I’d like to speak in private. It is a lovely night outside, perhaps we can be away from prying ears in the gardens?”Nagini agreed and walked into the other room to clasp on her charmed heated cloak. Nott Sr. returned into the room and wrapped Astoria’s cloak around her. The young witch looked at Dolohov with a disgusted look and whispered to him.“One day, I will fucking bury you for what you did to Lilla. Bloody bastard.” She said low enough for only Antonin to hear.Before he could speak more, Nagini returned to the room and was ready to go out into the gardens. The witches bid adieu to the wizards, and they were quickly met the kisses of the crisp night air upon their skin.Astoria felt her nerves begin to rattle once more. She heard tree frogs begin to croak once they walked deeper into the vegetation. The blonde witch lit up another cigarette and took deep inhales to calm her nerves.“How is our dear Draco? Did you leave the little husband at home?” Nagini mocked while grazing her hand against the tall hedges.Astoria scoffed and let out a cloud of smoke into Nagini’s face. “My husband is quite well. As a matter of fact, he is procuring the scrolls that lay out the schedule details for the uprising from Theo.”Astoria felt her eyes begin to scan her surroundings as she approached the very spot, she left her sister minutes prior. She had to make sure every part of the plan was in correct form. The young witch tossed her cigarette onto the stones and stepped on it firmly.“Oh—and my dear I am sorry to hear about your friend Lilliana. Such a shame for a young girl to lose her child.” Nagini spat while making a pouting face.Astoria wanted nothing more but to bash this woman’s face against the nearest stone fountain, but soon enough, she would meet her demise.“Tis’ a shame.” Astoria clapped back, not wanting to continue the conversation.“I do appreciate you stepping up for our Master, darling. I am sure he will find suitable youth within your core...somewhere...” Nagini winked and strutted in front.Astoria had half a mind to grab this witch by the fistful of hair, until she heard the rustle and bustle ahead of her. The young witch peeked her head in front of Nagini and noticed the red hair of a Weasley poking through the nearby hedges. It was like witnessing a bed or roses amongst grass.“What is that...” Nagini started to say until Astoria pulled back the snake bitch by her neck and held her wand under her chin.Daphne and George Weasley revealed themselves, finally, and the Weasel—Weasley had the sword of Gryffindor in hand. The last issue remained, force Nagini back into her snake form, which reinstates the horcrux curse within her.“I gave you your life back, and it is time I take it back...” Astoria said lowly into the witch’s ear.Astoria held her black hair firmly and narrowed her gaze to witness the fear in Nagini’s eyes. Perhaps Astoria should feel guilty for what she is doing to her own family, but perhaps--“You cunt of a witch! The Dark Lord will have your head!” Nagini cried out while attempting to thrash in place.---perhaps not. Astoria felt nothing but sheer power by taking this woman’s life. It felt good for someone else to feel pain for a change. Did it even feel good to inflict it? Astoria dared not to delve deeper into answering that question herself.“I doubt it.” Astoria growled.Astoria threw Nagini onto the ground and pointed her wand directly at her. She felt all eyes on her, but did she have the heart to condemn this woman? After all, she was a distant relative, but then, Astoria made eye contact with her little sister. Daphne’s eyes so hopeful and worried at the same time. She had to think about the well-being of her family, and the Wizarding world.Astoria was not Harry Potter, but Gods damn, she sometimes felt like the Chosen One. The dark deeds always seemed to fall in her lap. Perhaps Harry and Astoria were not so different from one another. However, one prime difference, Harry Potter was the boy who lived because his parents died for him. Astoria was destined for death before her birth, her parents manacled her life before she took her first breath. Could she call that a mother’s love to give up your child’s life before they have a say?“It does not matter what you do to me! Your fate is sealed!” Nagini spat again, and she pointed her gaze at Daphne and George. “There is no destroying the Dark Lord without destroying HER!” She yelled while pointing at Astoria.Astoria gripped her wand and casted the spell to give Nagini her maledictus curse once more. In an instant she witnessed this woman’s body twist and conjoin into one long slithering vessel. Nagini’s body once more, was a snake.“NOW GEORGE!” Daphne whaled.Astoria felt her feet stuck in place, and before she could form a coherent thought the giant snake sunk its teeth onto the young witch’s forearm. The feeling of her skin beginning to puncture felt as if someone ran a hot blade through her bones.George gripped onto the sword firmly and as the snake was lunging toward the weakened blonde witch on the ground, he connected the blade with the snake’s head. Nagini’s soul perished from her body and dissolved into the air as a thousand souls of a ghost.Astoria felt her body beginning to sway backward until someone stood behind her and held her close. Large hands wrapped her body, and her narrowed eyes glared upward to see shining platinum hair. She cracked a small smile, but even that made her feel like she may feint. It was her husband, his hair glistened in the moonlight. It had been so long since she has seen his natural hair, she almost forgotten what it looked like. For the time being, Draco was not casted under the identity spell.“I got you, Astoria.” Draco purred.Draco picked up Astoria and she nuzzled her head into his chest to rest her eyes. The spell that was used to turn Nagini back into her maledictus form was not easy by any means, plus being bitten by a large snake was not helping her physical state.Before anyone else could speak, the Dark Mark was conjured in the sky. The green smoke slithered around the lock that overlapped the snake. No one knew who conjured it, but no one could tear their eyes away for over a minute.“Do’ya reckon You-Know-Who knows we killed his pet snake?” George croaked out while gaping with his mouth open at the sky.Daphne let out a small, inappropriate, laugh and later coughed it out. She made her way over to Draco and Astoria.Astoria rolled her head over to glare at her sister. Daphne took her hand and smiled.“You did it. I am so proud.”Astoria smiled and gave her a weak ‘thumbs up.’ George walked over and draped his arm over Daphne and gave a small punch to Astoria’s arm.“Great job, little Slytherin.” George muttered with hints of playful sarcasm.Nobody could help but notice the green hues in everyone’s face, due to Voldemort’s mark lingering in the sky.“C’mon. We need to get going.” Daphne muttered.“I need to get Astoria home.” Draco was about to turn until Daphne tried to grab hold of his arm, and he lunged away.“No—you two need to come with us. The Order will be expecting—”Draco lunged forward and kept his wife close in his arms. His voice cold, his attitude, not the best. “I do not give a bloody damn about what your friends want right now. As you can very well see, your sister needs rest and I am going to make sure she gets it.”Without another word, Draco gripped onto his wand and apparated them both back to the safehouse in the Highlands. Astoria felt the crisp mountain air and heard nothing but the rustling leaves on trees.“How—how did you know where I was?” Astoria croaked out.Draco let out a cool laugh and placed Astoria on their bed to cover her with a blanket. “You did not believe I was going to leave your safety in the hands of your sister and a Weaselbee, did you?” He said sarcastically.“You over-protective bastard.” Astoria said playfully with a cheeky smile. “I am glad you were there though.” She said while letting out a low gasp at moving her arm the wrong way.The snake bite was not looking good. It was turning black, and the punctures themselves were scabbing over quickly.Draco held out his wand and muttered a small healing spell. Astoria felt instantly better, and never knew that her husband had a knack for healing magic. She questioned his skills and he chuckled.“I picked up on a few basic healing spells while lying in the hospital after harsh quidditch matches. I cannot begin to tell you how many times a bludger broke my wrist.” He said while ringing out his left wrist.“In a few days, the Order will call for us—”Draco shook his head and nuzzled his wife to his chest while stroking out strands of her hair. “Do not worry yourself about that, sleep now.”So much was on Astoria’s mind...did Voldemort know Nagini was dead? Would she be blamed for her death? Would the Dark Lord come for her...more...often...she felt the world slipping out of focus...until it went black. It had been a few months since Nagini met her ultimate demise. So far, there had been no official word from the Dark Lord’s high council or low council. Surely, there should have been a meeting on protection strategies for the Dark Lord if he felt his life was being targeted?Astoria and Draco reconjured the identity spells on themselves, and once again, Astoria’s hair was a russet color brown, along with Draco’s jet-black hair. The mornings in Scotland were still undeniably cold, but the couple found enjoyment in taking leisurely strolls through the muggle village on brisk mornings.A few days after Nagini was killed by George Weasley, Astoria and Draco attended an intimate meeting with the remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix.
  Astoria could feel how uncomfortable Draco was, just by how many times he was shifting in his seat. He had never met his Aunt. Andromeda, nor been in her house, so this was an awkward time for them. 

  They were told the meeting would be held here, rather than their ‘Headquarters’. They said it was for security purposes, but the Malfoy’s weren’t very too interested in the location of the Order’s dust infested meeting place.

  Andromeda Tonks, formerly Black, crept into the room. The older witch was not an official member of the Order but remained a faithful ally, even after the death of her husband, Ted Tonks. Her face had the Black features, she had the image of Narcissa rounded in her face. However, she possessed long brown hair, and a nurturing aura. 

  “Hello Draco, I am pleased to finally meet you. You have not any idea how long I have dreamed of meeting my nephew. And... This must be—” Andromeda said while extending her hand to Astoria.

  “My wife, Astoria Greengrass.” Draco stated cordially. 

  Astoria cracked a grateful smile and shook the witch’s hand delightfully. “Charmed, Mrs. Tonks.” 

  “You may call me Andromeda. Now, shall we begin?” She said warmly while extending her arm to the dining room. 

  Hestia Jones took a seat at the dining table and clasped her hands in front. Next to her was Ginny and George Weasley, followed by Molly and Arthur. Many of the Order members perished during the Battle of Hogwarts, so their numbers dwindled. However, Astoria did notice a certain bushy-haired witch not present, a witch she had not given much thought about in months, Hermione Granger. 

  Astoria wondered for a brief moment what the entitled Gryffindor must be up to these days. Was she a high ranked employee at the Ministry? Was she married? So many questions...

  Astoria thought to herself, ‘If anyone tells her (Hermione) who the newest aids of the Order are, she may stun herself.’ 

  “First off, let me begin by extending our gratitude, to you specifically, Ms. Greengrass. Without you we would have not been able to remove the snake. With her (Nagini) out of the equation, the Resistance has a fighting chance once more to defeat the Dark Lord.” Hestia said gratefully while making eye contact with the Malfoy’s. 

  “It’s Malfoy, but you are welcome. Draco and I are willing to aid the Order in whatever they need. We both feel, we have seen enough darkness in the world to continue the path we were traveling.” Astoria said while entwining her hand with Draco’s. 

  “How convenient that you of all people want to rid the world of darkness.” Molly Weasley spat lowly.

  Draco shot her a look of disgust, but Astoria knocked his foot. There was no reason to start a fight. Everyone knew who she was, and what she was a capable of. It was the Order’s decision to trust Astoria and Draco.

  It was of no surprise the air in the room was beginning to become stale, and tense. Two Death Eaters sitting across a handful of Resistance members. Hopefully, the Order could witness that Draco and Astoria were attempting to reverse the damage the Death Eaters’ have caused and restore their reputation in Wizarding society. 

  “Now, next we are going to require that you—” Hestia was beginning to say to Astoria until Draco slammed his fist on the table and caused everyone to jump.

  “My wife will not be completing anymore of your tasks. That damned snake bit her on her forearm, and she was immobile for over a day. She was left entirely too weak!” Draco spat. 

  Hestia lowered her eyes and began to shift in her seat. Ginny began to speak more plainly in the hopes it would not cause Draco to rise again. Astoria wanted nothing more but to shut her husband up, but it is not like he would listen to her, he always did he liked no matter what anyone says. 

  “Now enough acting like an entitled prat. You two agreed to helping us, and this is what we need. I am sorry Malfoy, but at this time, your wife is more valuable than YOU.” Ginny spat while rising from her seat, Draco followed.

  “I forbid my wife to be used as your puppet.” Draco growled while leaning against the table. 

  Astoria slammed her hands on the table and rose to her feat to glare at the ginger, and her husband who were acting unreasonable. 

  “TAIS-TOI (Shut up)! Both of you! Merlin’s fucking beard I cannot even form a coherent though without somebody shouting. Now, it is not like I am not already the Dark Lord’s puppet, it will not matter if the Order uses me just the same.” Astoria said regretfully. Draco shot her a look of defeat, while the Order held their tongues. 

  To hear those words, escape her lips made her chest heavy, and she noticed Draco lowering his head. He grasped onto her hand and massaged his thumb with hers. He knew what she was saying was the truth. Draco could offer nothing but plans for the uprising, and that was if he were invited to the High Council meetings. 

  It was Astoria who was more valuable and had access to the Dark Lord himself. She was the only one who was pliable enough to defeat him. 

  The meeting shorty concluded after, and the Order suggested that in the upcoming months Astoria should discover any weaknesses that reside in the Dark Lord. If she found any new information, she was to report back to Andromeda’s. 

   
Astoria and Draco were walking through the shops of the muggle village. She had her arm linked with his and she kept pulling an impatient Draco to every shop that sold interesting bobbles or flowers.“Ahhhh—Mr. and Mrs. Eddington. How are we doing today?” The Scottish merchant said with a smile.It was always a surprise to Draco and Astoria when someone called them by their muggle identity names, Victoria and Dean Eddington. Even though it had been a year since the identity charm was placed on them, the memory still had not stuck.“How do you fancy this one?” Astoria asked while holding up a marble fixture candle holder.Draco rolled his eyes and kissed her head. “If I say I like it, can we go home?”Astoria chuckled and shook her head; she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed his lips.“No, you promised me that today we could do something else, rather than rolling around on the floor wrapped in sheets...”Draco came up behind her and pulled her to whisper in her ear. “I’d like nothing more than to witness your bare arse wrapped in my sheets.”Astoria let out an embarrassed chuckle and broke herself from her husband’s grasp.After purchasing the candle holder, Astoria decided she could release her husband from his shopping imprisonment.“I will meet you back home...” She kissed his lips passionately. “...meet me in the sheets.” She whispered against his parted lips.He gave her one last goodbye kiss before walking back up the mountain to the safehouse.Astoria wanted to do some more browsing for perhaps flowers or more house décor, to make the Nott safehouse more Malfoy.As Astoria was glancing at a pair of assorted bluebells, she felt a prickle on the back of her neck, more specifically, on her runic imprint. This caused the hairs on her arm begin to rise. The Dark Lord was near.She felt herself begin to skulk around the flower shop to try and find the dark wizard before he found her. How she desperately wished Draco had not returned home so hastily.“Hello, my precious one.” A dark, blood curdling voice said from behind her ear.Astoria remained frozen in her stance and wanted nothing more but to run for the Highlands. Not look back, not look at his devil redeyes. Instead, she closed her eyes to put up her Occlumency walls. Her face fell, emotionless, stone-cold, frozen.“Master.” She spat.Voldemort strode in front of her and traced her face lightly with his finger, and gasped.“My, my, you do get more beautiful with age.” He purred. “Any plans for children yet, my dear Astoria?” He inquired.If Astoria could feel in this moment, she would be thinking about how heartbroken she is to think she could never give Draco children. Not even one. All for the protection of a child that would never be born. She knew why the Dark Lord was here, to drain more youth from her life. One day, her youth would run out, and she would die.“No, my Lord. I fear I am incapable of procreation. I offer you myself, as your life source.” Astoria stated expressionless.Voldemort’s face fell, and he connected his hand with her cheek. She fell instantly to the floor and felt the burning pain on her face. Astoria glared up at the Dark Lord and furrowed her brows.“Stupid girl! The only reason you are alive right now is to submit yourself to me. You have four years left. Otherwise, Ms. Dubois will perish, and it will be your fault.”Astoria lowered her head and tried not to think about Lilla. The memories of her, witnessing what she went through losing her child, and being a captive by her own husband. It was all to horrible to feel.Voldemort’s seized Astoria by the temples, and in moment’s notice she felt a searing hot rush flow through her body. It caused her to cry out, and a blinding white light flashed across her eyes.
  “It’s okay sweetheart... let go...” A voice said in the distance. “You are so brave...” 
Astoria’s eyes snapped back to reality, and she found herself on the gravel, fallen at her feet in the rear of a flower shop. The Dark Lord would be gone for another year.Astoria still had not disclosed to Draco what the Dark Lord has been doing to her, but she will, one day, when the time is right, and that time has still not made its self-known.She young witch tilted her head back to look at the Scotland clouds. How the birds flew in packs, how she envied their loyalty. However, she noticed a straggler bird who was struggling to catch up with its family.She chuckled to herself and spoke as if she were advising the lonely bird.“Don’t worry. We are all playing catch up these days. The only problem is, which pack am I trying to catch up too?”She heard footsteps from behind the ally creep closer to her, but she felt too weak but to do anything more than turn to her head.“Astoria? Oh, my lord and ladies, are you alright?” A kind voice said while propping up her head.“Andromeda?” Astoria said in shock and confusion.Andromeda nodded her head and pulled her wand from her satchel. She scanned the area for prying eyes, and began a healing charm over Astoria’s body. Instantly, she felt light on her feet, and her body no longer felt fatigue.“How did you—”“I have a knack for healing magic.” Andromeda spoke plainly.Astoria had so many questions flooding her brain. What was Andromeda doing their, and why did she just heal her? Did she see the Dark Lord? Does Andromeda know why Astoria was left weakened on the ground?All she knew was, she was grateful for this witches’ arrival.
  
    Chapter Text
    
  2004
The spring air was crisp, and the sun was shining brightly down upon the village gardens. The flowers bloomed their aroma, and the rambunctious colors filled the grasslands.The village that laid below Astoria and Draco’s house was beginning to grow quite populated. The villager’s tenants’ young children began to grow, and many little tykes began roaming the streets. Smiles from cheek to cheek, and ongoing babbles of pretend sword fighting.Astoria plucked the most vivacious of colored wildflowers and planted them into her basket. She scanned the grounds for the herbs she desired for her weekly brews.The young witch had gotten into the habit of developing her alchemy skill and became obsessed with brewing new concoctions. Draco was often her test monkey, and it took quite some time for her to brew the correct ingredients with its partners. It was not uncommon that after Draco was finished being his wife’s test subject he would have to retire to the loo for an hour, or two. However, over the years Astoria has perfected many potions, such as the Draught of Peace, Polyjuice (after many failed attempts) and the Invisibility potion. “Here, take these. It is always handy to keep lavender leaves in your stores.” Andromeda said.Andromeda had become more than a friend to Draco and Astoria, she was family. After Andromeda found Astoria on the ground of the village three years ago, the young witch confided in her and told her everything. Astoria missed her mother and father dearly, and that is how she viewed Andromeda sometimes. The maternal figure she should have had in her life. Someone to help guide her through tough decisions, and aid when sick.However, there was still an outstanding issue. Neither witch had informed Draco about what had been happening to Astoria these past four years. For all that time Astoria had been given a visit from the Dark Lord and he had been draining the youth from her mind, body, and soul.Astoria made Andromeda swear on Merlin that she would not tell her nephew why her health was deteriorating. She felt awful for hiding such a secret from her husband, but these past years had been nothing but utter bliss. How could she tell him that sooner or later she was going to die an untimely death?“Take these as well. You can plant peppermint leaves in your morning tea and say that it will aid your well-being.”Astoria huffed and took the peppermint willingly. All this time, she had broken a sacred vow to Draco. She had been feeding him lies, after lies, after lies. Astoria did not have the heart to break her husband’s spirit.There was a part inside of her that blamed Andromeda for the lies. After all, it had been her idea to make up the idea of an ancestral blood curse. The basis of the “curse” involved deteriorating health, and eventually it would take her life. Andromeda conveniently added in that if Astoria delivered a child, it would weaken her condition extensively and it would bring her to her ultimate demise faster.When Draco heard that his wife had to bare the pain of a blood curse it shattered his world. Astoria held him for hours, and he clutched onto her like she was going to evaporate. She kept telling herself that not all of it was a lie. Every time the Dark Lord came to her for rejuvenation, she was in fact reaching her death faster. For several hours Draco cried with his wife over the fact she may never bare a child. They would never create a family of their own.She kept telling herself it was better this way for Draco because he would not put the blame on himself. None of what was happening was his fault, it was Astoria’s. She forced him down into the depths of this life with her. All for the sake of love.As the witches continued to gather enough herbs to stock their personal stores, they trotted back to the village streets. Browsing through the various merchants and listening to their daily spiels regarding the fresh produce.Since Astoria (or rather her muggle identity, Victoria) has been a tenant of this village for many years, it was not uncommon for her to become recognized on the street.Very often she would hear, “Good day, las!” or “Evening Mistress Victoria!” The formality of the Scottish merchants was uncanny, but she did enjoy hearing them speak sometimes. Although not all the locals are friendly.Astoria was regarding a local art piece when Jocasta, the local seer (or the village loony), approached her abruptly and tugged at her arm. Astoria jolted, nearly losing her footing, but attempted to tug her arm free from Jocasta’s grip. The loon of a woman tugged her down to her size and spoke low, and cold.“I sense er’ a great deal’a pain in your aura, lassie!” The old woman sneered, and she regarded Astoria’s wedding band closely. She brought to her haggard face, and looked as if she was going to either lick it or smell it?“Your husband gave it to ya’, did he?”Astoria, still trying to yank her hand free, nodded and lifted her chin proudly. “Yes, he did. It is my wedding band. Now if you please—”Jocasta gripped tighter and pulled the witch into her face to whisper. Astoria could smell the cheap Irish whisky off her breath.“I see strong iron manacles, and a bottle of strange liquid in your future.” The loony woman paused to close her eyes, and she hummed slowly. Her eyes snapped open and bolted at Astoria. “She will be as beautiful as the sun and suffer the same fate as you.” Jocasta sneered, but a look of confusion stumbled upon her wrinkled face. “That is...if you are bold enough to act upon the change that will restore balance...”Astoria finally broke free, and nearly lost her footing, again, until Andromeda stood behind her to guide her down the road. The young witch was trying to digest what the town loony just told her. Who was she?“Do not trouble yourself, Astoria. Jocasta is the village mental-case. Probably spittin’ tales of old Scottish Highlanders.” Andromeda said calmy while keeping her arm linked with Astoria’s.Astoria tried to reason with herself that the old woman’s visions were nothing more but mindless jabber. The gibberish of a deranged loon. She could not get the image of Jocasta’s facial expression to leave her mind, it was burned on her brain. The look of hatred turned into confusion. What did that old woman know? Astoria presumed long ago that Jocasta must be a witch herself, but not a fully developed one. However, since she is known to the village as a seer, she must have a knack for Divination. The look the old woman got in her eye when she would see her visions is a look Astoria knew all to well from her school days. A look from a professor who wore thick glasses, and mounds of scarfs, Cybill Trelawny.  ***Draco clutched the letter he received in his hand and crumbled it into bits. He snatched the bottle of firewhisky from the shelf and took a long slug.He did not know what he felt. Was it sadness or hatred? All he knew was that he wanted to drink, and drink, until his pain was eased by the solace of a liquid haze.After downing the first bottle in almost one shot, he summoned the next and plopped a seat on his armchair. Draco kept reading the letter over and over, as if the words on the parchment were going to erase itself.“Incendio.” He spat, and within a flash the parchment was sent ablaze. The words were finally erased, but the message within would remain.Draco felt his heart fall from his chest, and land in the pit of his stomach. If he were eleven-years old, perhaps he would feel differently about the situation. Small tears began to pool in his eyes, and with that, the rush of emotion hit him like an express train.He screamed and bellowed into the air, over and over, until he felt he was finished, but nothing was helping. The pain was still present. After drinking another half bottle, Draco felt himself slipping, his eyes became heavy, and he found himself in a quite comfortable position that he could almost...drift...into a deep...sleep... “Draco. Wake up. Draco!” Astoria said while trying to prop his head up.Draco’s eyes cracked open at the sight of his wife’s eyes glaring into his. Her hair was grazing the sides of her cheeks, with the bulk of it remained in a bun plopped at the top of her head. It must had been morning.“You slept through dinner, and the entire night. I figured you indulged in the whisky too much last night, so I let you sleep it off.” She muttered with a small smile on her face.Draco almost forgot the message that remained within the letter he burned at his finger tips the night prior. He looked down at his slightly scorched index finger and remembered what he did, and why he did it. All Draco cared about moments before was the sight of his wife waking him up.Draco grazed his hand across her cheek, and his smile quickly fell. He lowered his head and felt his emotions pore once again.“Oh—my. Draco what is it?” She said while embracing Draco firmly. “Please talk to me.”Draco held onto his wife and took into remembrance how he felt in her arms. The warmth of her body, the smoothness of her skin, while listening to the melody of her voice.He needed to tell her what troubled him. Draco did not want to keep secrets from his wife. They had made a vow some years prior about not keeping secrets from one another. Plus, she was going to discover the truth shortly.“My father is dead.” He whispered.Draco waited for what Astoria’s response might be. Would she be thrilled or grieve along side him?“Even though he was a bastard of a man, he was your father.” Astoria muttered and she planted a small kiss upon his lips. “I am here, if you need me.”Draco rose to his feet and poured his wife a whisky neat. “The memorial is tonight, at the Manor. Will you accompany me?” He asked calmly.Astoria laughed lowly and downed the whisky. She nodded quickly, but her face suddenly twisted. “Is it safe? I mean—I know we have not heard any new information regarding the Ministry searches for you in some time but still...”“I have no choice.” Draco buckled the belt to his trousers and pulled the infamous black blazer around him. He pulled his wand from his pocket, tapped it upon his head, and instantly his jet-black hair turned platinum.“My turn.” Astoria said while standing in front of him.Draco repeated the action, and he watched her russet brown hair transform into a gorgeous blonde. He wrapped his arms around his wife and placed a kiss on the back of her neck. Draco relished at the fact that it has been years since he has seen his wife’s natural blonde hair.“I need a whisky before we do this.” He murmured lowly.The couple had to use an emergency Portkey set up by Theo to travel to a different country. The floo network was sometimes tricky, and the Ministry kept their eyes on who was traveling where. Astoria and Draco always tried their hardest to avoid the floo network whenever necessary.Draco and Astoria landed at the edge of the walkway in front of the Manor. The tall hedges lined up to the grand gates, and many memories flashed before his eyes.Astoria entwined her hand with his and granted him a warm smile. He felt as if his stomach was going to turn inside out. Draco had not seen his mother since the day of the wedding disaster and was unsure how she was going to react to her only son showing up with the same woman he ran away with.The iron gates opened instantly for the couple, and the sounds of the orchestra were becoming more apparent with every step they took. Quite odd that there would be music playing at a memorial service, but Narcissa was an interesting hostess.“Master Draco, welcome home.” A tiny garden elf said from behind a nearby bush.Draco gave the tiny creature a nod, and his attention was drawn to the nearby gardens. In the very spot where Lucius was teaching Draco how to fly properly.
  “Mount up, Draco. If you want to win, then you need to learn to control your broom.” Lucius sneered.

  Draco gripped onto the broom with all his might. With every lap he did around the property it was not good enough for his father. He wanted to do anything but let his father down, so he dove down towards the Earth at high speed and attempted a trick shot. Draco felt the broom gain control over him, rather than the other way around, he tried to pull up but the broom was not listening. This was it. He was going to die by plummeting straight into the ground, all because of a broom. He was meters from the ground, inches, centimeters... 

  “Immobilize!” Lucius spat. 

  Draco froze in midair, still half an inch from the ground. Suddenly, he hit the ground but at a much softer speed. 

  “Next time I will let your body splatter across the grass. You are a disgrace. No wonder you cannot catch the snitch before Potter. You are an embarrassment.” Lucius said coldly at his thirteen-year-old son. 

  Draco felt his heart fall into pieces, and his entire world shatter. He was useless, and hopeless as a Quidditch Seeker. The only way he was ever going to impress his father was by beating Saint Potter at a match. One day, it will happen. 
“Evening, Draco.” A kind voice said from the doorway.Draco’s eyes snapped back into reality to witness his mother looking at him with sorrowful eyes, and a black laced dress. Although, it does not seem she looks like a distraught widow who just lost her husband.“Mother. I trust you remember Astoria?” Draco spat while acknowledging his wife’s presence.He could see Narcissa’s facial expression shift from sorrowful to hatred, or annoyance. She extended her hand towards Astoria.“How could I forget?” Narcissa said. “Delighted you could make it.” The old witch said sarcastically with his upper lip curled, and her brow raised.“I think it would be best to put our differences aside for a night...for your son’s sake.” Astoria said broadly.Narcissa scoffed and rolled her eyes. The two women exchanged a small handshake, and an awkward gaze. The air was growing stale and tense, so much so that if one took a blade to it, it could be cut in half.“I sense you still hold bitterness in your heart. However, I can respect a woman who can hold such a grudge.” Astoria said.Draco guided his wife into the foyer and the Manor looked as if there was a glamorous party being held. There were floating trays of champagne, wine and firewhisky. The self-playing orchestra was playing the epidemy of elegant music.Astoria grabbed herself a champagne glass, and Draco did the same but with the firewhisky. It seemed many people were surprised to see Draco back home. There were quite a few familiar faces, he had not seen in many years, and along with those faces came the hushed tones.“I am surprised he had the nerve to come home!” One wizard spoke in a cold whisper.“I heard that girlfriend of his is also one of them.” Another witch said to her circle of other witches.Draco tried his best to laugh off their idiocy, but it was difficult to do. He was still a wanted man, and he was taking a great risk attending this memorial tonight.“Quite exquisite for a memorial, don’t you think?” Astoria said sarcastically.Draco snorted and took a sip from his glass. “Welcome to the Malfoy’s. Where were graze over the true meaning of funeral. My father’s death was just another excuse for my mother to throw a party and gain attention. My mother loves nothing more but being the center of attention.”After some time of keeping to themselves in the corner drinking and making awkward eye-contact with practically everybody. Narcissa approached the couple.“It is time for the reading of your father’s will.”This should be interesting. Draco was sure it was going to read somewhere along the lines of, “To my ungrateful family, you bastards receive nothing. I leave all my galleons to Tom Marvolo Riddle.”Draco, Astoria, Narcissa and Lucius’ lawyer all gathered within his late father’s study and were ready to listen to Lucius Malfoy’s final wishes.The lawyer spread out the scroll and cleared his throat. “I am not a perfect man, nor do I claim to be, all the time. I have made mistakes as a wizard, husband and father that are unforgiveable, and I will never ask for your forgiveness. However, my wife, nor my son are perfect neither.          To my Cissa, the light of my life, and the woman who agreed to marry me all those years ago. I know I was a difficult man to live with, sometimes a fearful one, but you were no picnic neither, my love. You have made greater mistakes, than I. Therefor, I leave you with something you already possess, your name. I grant you the luxury of the Malfoy name. It is a name you have cheated, lied, and yearned for since before we were acquainted. Now, it is all you have left.          To Draco Lucius Malfoy, my only son, and soul heir to the Malfoy name, Manor, and fortune. I have wronged you in more ways I could count, but it does no good to spell out everything I have failed for you. I am sure I did not make amends with you before my death, which is why I entrust my lawyer to speak of this on my behalf. I have always tried to give you everything you yearned for, even in love. For that, I leave to you Malfoy Manor. The house in which many wrongs were committed, and I want nothing more but it to be filled with love and laugher once more. I also leave the wealth, and power of the Malfoy estate. I trust that you will put the money to good use and use it to grow your own family one day.”The lawyer rolled up the scroll and held out the many documents in front of Draco. Narcissa looked flabbergasted, and in more shock than she ever had in her life. Lucius left her nothing, and now she has no money, and no home. Draco felt bewildered that his father had chosen to leave his wife homeless, but perhaps their marriage was not as it seemed to him as a child?“Now, if you will just sign here Mister Malfoy all will be –” The lawyer held out the quill when Narcissa stood abruptly and began to yell.“This is unconceivable! Lucius could not have left me with nothing!” She said in a frantic tone and then she turned to her only son, basically trampling over Astoria causing her to shift back in her seat.“Draco! Please, my son, my precious boy. You know I cannot survive on my own, I have been taken care of my entire life. Your father and I married right after Hogwarts, I have nowhere to go...you are my son it is your duty to care for your mother!”In a moments time Draco went from a son who was disgraced by his mother and father, to somebody his mother is pleading on her knees. His entire life the only memories he had of his father were negative. Draco was never enough for Lucius’ standards, and now this bloody bastard of a lawyer is spitting out these words that make no sense.Lucius had no love for Draco, he proved it to himself plenty over the years when he was physically disciplining him or scolding him for losing a Quidditch match.Nothing about this situation made sense, not the will, not the words written on the parchment. If his father truly cared for him, why not attempt contact over the years? Why wait until death to fix the broken pieces?“Erm—well anyways, if you will just sign here---” The lawyer continued to push the parchment towards Draco until Narcissa interrupted once more.“Draco please, listen to me.” Narcissa pleaded with hopeful eyes and woe in her tone.“If it would be alright, I would like a moment in private with my husband, if you please...” Astoria said calmly.Narcissa glared at Astoria for a moment before stamping her feet across the way, the lawyer followed her.Astoria stood behind Draco and began to massage his shoulders which turned into a warm embrace.“Tell me what you’re thinking about. Perhaps I can help?”“None of this makes sense.” He finally said. “Why would he leave me everything and leave my mother with nothing?”Astoria huffed and shrugged. “Lucius was a complicated man, but I believe sometimes that his heart was in the right place...”“Never speak on his behalf.” Draco spat while rising to his feet. He began to rummage through his fathers’ desk and found a half empty scotch bottle.
  Perfect. 
He popped the top and downed the remaining expensive scotch. Draco plopped into his father’s chair and stared down at the parchments before him. Before him laid everything he once desired. To be Master of Malfoy Manor, to be one of the richest wizards in Britain. To have a taste of the power his father once held on his fingertips. Draco desired all of that, once upon a time.However, what was rattling his brain at this moment was how much his mind was telling him it was blood money. Money that was tainted and won by cheating, lies, and betrayal. Did Draco want to build a lavish life with dirty money? Could he build a life in this very mansion that housed so many bad memories? After all, after he signs those parchments, it is all his... and his wife’s.“I’m sorry. I was not trying to upset you.” Astoria croaked while shifting in her seat. She stood on her two feet to shift her weight on the desk in front of Draco with her arms folded. “Whatever your decision is, I am with you...”“How lovely of you. My wife in shining armor.” Draco sneered. Why was he so angry? Surely, he should not be angry with Astoria, it was not her fault. But every time he looked around the room, he found something else to be angry with and Astoria happen to be the easy target.“Very well. I will leave you here to sulk then!” She spat, and before she could leave his presence, Draco grabbed her by the hand and pulled her into his body, connecting their lips.Astoria did not fight his embrace, but simply wrapped her arms around his neck and deepened the kiss. Draco picked up his wife and placed her on the edge of the desk and began to hike up her skirt while attempting to pull down her stockings.“Draco...we shouldn’t...” She said lowly against his lips.Draco, ignoring her words, ripped off her stockings and tossed them to the side. He raked his hands through her hair and gripped her scalp, causing her to breathe heavy.The fire burned inside of him, he had felt this type of burn before, it was not entirely lust, but entwined with anger, or perhaps grief? He could feel his wife attempting to break their sexual contact, but something inside of him was not listening.Draco’s destiny was determined for him in this very room. Where his father told him how to act as the future Master of Malfoy Manor. It was also the very office that Lucius told him that he was a disgrace to the Malfoy name.“Draco...someone will come in....we should...not...” Astoria continued to say, but before she could speak again Draco unzipped his trousers and exposed his erected cock.Draco dove deep inside of his witch and thrusted himself firmly inside of her with no time for adjustment. He held onto the base of her body and grinded firmly against her.He watched her mouth remain open with heavy breaths, and how he wanted to wrap his hand around her neck. His hand slithered up her torso, under her blouse before ripping it apart. Draco ran his thumb against her left nipple and twisted it between his fingers. His hand continued its journey up to her glorious neck, and he found that his hand fit nicely around it. Draco felt his wife’s pulse under his thumb, and with every pump her pulse rose.He began to squeeze his hand around her neck harder, and he thrusted himself into her as hard as he could, but he realized Astoria’s eyes were closed, and she was making no sounds...nor was Draco.Draco felt his climax drawing closer, and he gripped onto his wife as hard as he could, and he released himself into her. After his orgasm, he felt nothing but darkness. He zipped up his trousers and walked across the room in silence.Astoria readjusted her skirt and said nothing for a few moments. She repaired her shirt with a simple spell, and after she composed herself, she spoke.“How could you do that to me...” She croaked out. “That was not love.” Astoria said while tears streaming down her face.Draco felt the anger returning to his body, and the resentment building inside him. Astoria was his wife, sex was apart of marriage, doesn’t sex equal love?“I don’t know what you mean...” Draco began to say coldly before Astoria shoved his chest.“I told you we should not, and you had your way anyway! Do as you wish with your father’s wishes, but I am leaving. I cannot even bare to look at you!” Astoria cried out before escaping the room.Draco did not have the strength to chase after her. He felt wrong for perusing her when she did not want him. Why did he not think? What darkness took over him so badly that nothing else mattered except getting his cock wet? The lawyer began to scratch on the parchment paper the new changes to where the Malfoy estate will be distributed.“Please, proceed Mister Malfoy.”Draco took a deep breath and crossed his knee over his leg. “I would like a considerable amount of galleons be donated to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I understand they are having difficulties with funding the re-construction and I would like to help in the only way I can. Second, I would like to open a separate account for my wife, Astoria. I would like her maidan name to be on it, Astoria Greengrass as well as her married name. Transfer thirty-thousand galleons into that account. No one is to touch it, but her...”“Of course, sir...now what about the matter of Malfoy Manor?”“This house has been in my family for generations, and I would like nothing more but to see it burned to the ground. I am content with my current housing situations. I leave the matter of housing decisions to Theodore Nott Jr. I trust he will find an adequate use for this place.”Draco scratched his name at the bottom of the parchment, and felt a weight lift off his shoulders. Malfoy Manor was the last of his concerns, but now he had a new problem. He needed to find Astoria and make things right.Draco shook the lawyer’s hand, and before he could exit there was a last word. “Now...Mister Malfoy I was your father’s dear friend...which is I why I did him the kindness of being discreet with being in your presence. After all, the Ministry will never stop searching for you, until you are locked away, for good.”Draco huffed and shoved his hand in his pocket. “I am grateful for your service. Now, if you please...”The two wizards exited the study and Draco was immediately met with the last person he wanted to see, his mother.“Draco! How dare you give away our home! Now where am I to go? Hmm?” Narcissa said coldly.Draco rolled his eyes and pinched his temple. “I think it is time we all move on, mother.”Narcissa huffed and had tears stream down her face. She stomped her feet once more and ran to her room, for the last time.Draco walked over to Theo and whispered. “Where is Astoria? Have you seen her?”Theo remained quiet for a moment before pursing his lips. “She left, mate. Pansy took her back to our house. I wouldn’t reckon going over there—”Before Theo could finish his sentence, Draco was halfway outside, wand out, and prepared to apparate to the Nott Estate. He needed to fix this if he wanted to save his marriage. Draco never imagined Astoria would walk out on him, she must be undeniably angry.
  
    Chapter Text
    
  2004
It had been nearly two weeks since Astoria stormed out of Lucius’ memorial service. She had been staying with Pansy and Theo and could not bear to look at Draco’s face. She had never been more disappointed or infuriated with him before.Draco apparated to the Nott Estate every morning and night to try and talk with her, but Pansy would not allow him through the door.          “Astoria! I need to talk with you! Darling, please!”          Astoria hid behind the corner of the foyer and watched Pansy stand in the center of the doorway not allowing Draco to pass.          “She does not want to see you. When she is ready, I am sure she will come home...”          “Astoria is my wife, Parkinson! None of this concerns YOU!” Draco bellowed out while attempting to shove past her, but Theo stood behind her.          “Enough is enough, mate. Go home, drink it off. Astoria will talk to you when she is ready, but now is not the time.” Theo said assertively.          Finally, after more quarreling, Draco exited the door. Astoria felt her chest ache with grief, how badly she wanted to look into those gray eyes and have his arms around her, but he fucked up. Draco needed to learn that Astoria is not someone he can use whenever he pleases.Astoria found herself wandering mindlessly through the halls of the mansion. Regarding the many pieces of art, the portraits, and the enchanted photographs that lined the wall.She looked over the balcony to see Pansy and Theo embracing one another tightly and noticed how upset Pansy was. Her eyes filled with tears, and Theo scratching the top of her head.Pansy kept muttering the words, “Why? Why did this happen?” to her husband, and Theo kept silent.Astoria did not feel comfortable watching such a personal, intimate moment between a couple, so she excused herself to her bedroom balcony.When dinner had concluded Pansy and Astoria sat in the formal living room and found themselves at the bottom of a wine bottle. Her head dazed, and her lips slippery with words. The same effect seems to be happening with Pansy, but more dark emotion seemed to have taken over her face.“Tell me what’s wrong.” Astoria said while cocking her head at her friend.Pansy shook her head, and a few droplets of tears fell from her eyes that she quickly brushed off with her finger.“It’s okay, you can trust me, I won’t tell anyone.”Pansy scoffed and finished off the wine within her glass, and finally glared over at Astoria.“It’s not a secret, just a tragedy.”“Tell me anyway.” Astoria said while showing to Pansy that she gained her full attention.Pansy shifted in her seat and began to rim the glass with her fingertip. “Theo and I are trying to have child.”Astoria’s eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas. She grabbed Pansy’s hand and granted her a large smile. “Oh, my Merlin that is wonderful!”Pansy shook her head once more and more tears fell from her face. “Yes, it would be. But—” She paused and caught her breath.“But....” Astoria questioned.“This morning I had my third miscarriage. The baby was not far along, only a few weeks, but I had high hopes. You know what they say? Third times a charm.”Astoria felt her eyes lower and become glossy. It was apparent now on why Draco and Astoria had not seen much of the Nott’s in a year. It would appear they were having far worse issues than Astoria could imagine. Magical pregnancies are difficult for any witch and for some women it was difficult to become pregnant, many become barren.“I’m sorry Pans. Is there anything Draco and I can do you for both?”Pansy shook her head again and grabbed onto Astoria’s hand. “Its in the hands of the Gods now.” She wiped a tear off her cheek and took a large exhale. “When are you going to let the git talk to you? Sooner or later, he is going to burn down my house just to have you run out....”Astoria laughed lowly and quickly her smile diminished. Was she ever going to be able to look at Draco the same again? Was there marriage doomed from this point on?“I am not sure. Draco fucked up this time, more than he ever has...”Pansy summoned another bottle a wine over and filled their glasses. “You still love him, yes?”Did she still love Draco? Could she love a man who did not respect her virtue when she did not want to fuck? Who was she kidding?“With all that I am. I cannot help it. That man is everything and more but is also a royal pain in my arse.”Pansy and Astoria shared a laugh, and were shortly joined by Theo.“Good evening to the two most gorgeous women to walk this Earth.” Theo said while placing a soft kiss upon his wife’s lips.“You have never said a truer statement, Mister Nott.” A tipsy Astoria said while downing the rest of her wine.After a few more glasses of wine, harmless banter, and many exchanged laughs, Astoria began to feel as if she was back in the Slytherin dormitories. With the bottles being passed around, and the stories being exchanged it made her think back to a time when things were a tad simpler.But then Astoria turned her head to look at Draco who would normally be sitting next to her on the Slytherin couches, and he was not there. Perhaps it was a sign that she missed him more than she realized?Astoria decided to retire early, and as she was planning to hop into bed into a dreamless sleep, she heard stones being thrown at her window. She cocked her head and tried to listen in and think about if she was hearing things?After three more stones hit her balcony window, she planted her feet on the ground and glared out the window. And down below her window was none other than the tall, dark, handsome man who stole her heart away countless times.She opened her balcony doors and placed her elbows on the ledge. It was a scene out of a fairytale...“And just who are you supposed to be?” Astoria said while cocking her head.If it had not been for the enormous amounts of wine in her blood, then she would have ignored his calling, but her heart was speaking louder than her brain.“Come home. Please.”Astoria huffed and shook her head. “No. I am not ready.”Draco snorted and crossed his arms. “You are my wife; you belong with me.”Astoria nodded and smirked. “Indeed, I am your wife. Which a prime reason why you should allow me time to think.”Draco began to become more agitated and flared his arms. “What is there to ponder? I fucked up, I get it, you are punishing me enough by keeping your distance!”Astoria grew annoyed and began to walk away from the balcony when she heard Draco begin to crawl up the side of the house. Doing a poor job of it, at that. She peered over the side out of pure interest.“Having fun?”Draco scoffed and put up a middle finger towards her, causing her to laugh. Draco lost his footing and fell flat on his arse and cursed under his breath. Climbing was obviously not his strong suit.“I will come home, Draco. I have not left you for good.” She admitted lowly.“I am lost without you.” He whispered.Astoria lowered her head and tried her best to chalk back the tears. It was destroying her on the inside to see Draco this distraught and at her expense, but he needed to understand their marriage is a partnership, not an ownership.“I will speak to you soon.” Astoria said as she closed the doors to the balcony, slowly and regretfully.It felt awful to close the doors on Draco’s face, but all Astoria desired right now was to down a Sleeping Draught and have a peaceful night... Another two weeks had passed since Astoria’s initial arrival. She had decided to spend her time to think about what she truly wanted, and discovered how happy she was on her own, but then often enough she would feel the lonely void of Draco’s absence. Astoria’s heart knew someone was missing from the equation. Her emotions were beginning to become more apparent in her paintings.“Seems a bit dark and gloomy, doesn’it?” Theo said from behind her.Astoria cocked her head and flicked her cigarette off the balcony. She had painted a woman who stood on a bridge, and there were two figures standing on both ends. The girl was shaded in yellow, on one of the figures was colored in blue and the other was gray.Astoria did not understand her painting, but she knew whomever the woman was that she created, her heart was drawing her towards the figure painted blue.Sometimes she felt as if she was being irrational for not wanting to return home to Draco, but something inside of her was telling her she needed space. Time to think or perhaps heal. “Clasp your cloak little witch. We are going to a party.” Theo said while tossing Astoria’s cloak at her.A party? Does it seem like Astoria wants to celebrate anything right now? She felt lonely, confused, and irritable.“Bug off. I’m going back to sleep.” She said while tossing the cloak on the floor.Pansy grabbed her by the hands and attempted to pull her up. “You’re going. You have not left this house in almost three weeks. I know you are sad, but—”“SAD? I am not SAD! I am CONFUSED! I have no idea what I feel, my mind is in a whirl, and my body feels répugnante!” Disgusting. Pansy rolled her eyes and flicked her wand, casting an appearance charm over Astoria. Instantly her unwashed hair, ruddy clothes, and bags under her eyes transformed. Suddenly her hair started to glow blonde, her face radiated, and she wore a sleek black dress.“How am I supposed to go to a party? Have you forgotten who I am or who I am married too? Its as if I should slap a sign on my arse that states, ‘Known Death Eater, Arrest Me.’” Astoria said while slapping her backside.Theo knelt before her and tried to talk calmly with her. All she knew was, she was not going anywhere. Astoria wanted to sit in her pathetic armchair and cry into her arm for the rest of the evening.“You are going, even if we have to drag you.”Astoria rolled her eyes and stomped up on her feet. She gave the Nott’s a sarcastic glare, followed by a middle finger gesture.The three best friends apparated into what looked like an abandon muggle hospital. There were shattered windows, spray paint on the doors. The spray paint read, “KEEP OUT”. Something inside Astoria began to turn, and this was not an ideal place for a party.“Erm---why are we at a muggle hospital?” Astoria inquired while cocking her head and trying not to step on dead mice leading up to the door.“Like you said, you are on the Ministry’s hit list. Did you expect us to travel to a Wizard pub?” Theo said sarcastically.As they approached the door a wizard appeared from the shadows. Theo approached him and shook his hand.“Evening Gerad.”“Welcome, Mister and Mrs. Nott. Who do we have here tonight?” Gerad said lowly while glaring at Astoria.“This is Astoria.”“Greengrass?” Gerad said with his eyes bulging.“Malfoy, actually.” Astoria said proudly.“You are most welcome here, Mrs. Malfoy.” Gerad said while extending his arm to allow them inside.The trio walked through the door and the inside turned into a magnificent club scene. The strobe lights filled the air every few seconds, and the music blared without a care. Astoria felt dumbfounded, where was she right now?As she peered around, she noticed members from the Dark Lord’s council waltzing around, and a few other dark wizards at the bar area. How had she not known such a place existed?“Pansy, what the hell, where are we?”Pansy linked her arm with Astoria and smiled. “Do not worry, we are all safe here. This place is under the radar from the Ministry.”“Let’s get a drink.” Theo said.Astoria plopped onto a bar stool and ordered a wizard vodka and soda. It had been a while since she had her favorite drink, and maybe this was what she needed to get her mind off her husband.“Having fun yet?” Pansy said with a grin on her face.After half of her drink gone, she felt her head becoming lighter, and her words beginning to slip more freely from her mouth.“YES!” Astoria said proudly. She linked her arm with Pansy and pulled her onto the dance floor, leaving Theo to fend for himself.Astoria tilted her head back to watch the lights fill the air. The girls were back-to-back with people, but they did not care. It had been years since Astoria could completely release and allow herself to have fun.As she was dancing to her own rhythm, she felt someone come up behind her, and wrap their arms around her torso.Without turning around, she closed her eyes and felt the person’s touch. They ran their hands up the sides of her body and buried their lips onto her neck.It was then when it hit her, she knew those lips, and this touch. She spun around quickly to see the familiar face of her husband, Draco.“Wha—”Draco smashed his lips upon hers and Astoria deepened the kiss. She felt herself become sober and arched herself into him. Draco ran his hands through her hair and raked his fingers through her strands. Astoria gripped onto his neck and nipped his bottom lip.“Enough is enough. You are coming with me tonight, darling.”Astoria nodded as if he was her drill sergeant. She had not realized how much she missed this man, until this moment. All these weeks apart, all the time wasted, because of her ignorant mind.“How did you know where I was?”Draco scoffed and tilted her chin with his thumb. “I told Theo to bring you here. You are my wife and I wanted you back.”Astoria wrapped her arms around him and embraced him tighter than she ever has.“I am sorry, sweetheart. I will never do what I did again.” She whispered in her ear, and as he did Astoria nodded to him.Draco and Astoria left the muggle hospital hand in hand and traveled to the nearby Portkey to take them home. As Astoria was turning the corner to walk down the aisle to the Portkey, she smelled horrendous amounts of trash. The smells filled her nostrils and began to turn her stomach.“I think... I think I may...” Astoria began to say while gripping onto Draco’s hand.She held onto the brick alley wall and vomited up her dinner and everything that sat in her stomach. Draco held her hair and rubbed her back.“Did you drink too much?”Astoria breathed deeply before standing against the wall and wiping her face with Draco’s handkerchief. She shrugged her shoulders and finally started to feel better.“Must have.” She said while discarding the dirty cloth aside.Draco and Astoria’s Portkey dropped them nearby and as they were walking Astoria’s admired the silence of the Highlands. How she missed hearing natures bliss.

  2004
Astoria felt drops of sweat leave her forehead, and her hands begin to moisten... The world around her looked gray, but bright lights shined down on her... The heat from the lights made her skin feel as if she were on fire... Figures surrounded her, and she felt her body being positioned by unknown hands.“She’s losing a lot of blood. We need to keep her stable...” A voice said faintly from the side of her.Astoria felt strong enough to raise her head and speak dryly... “Where...where is he? Tell me...”The young witch sprung up wide awake in her bed, nestled safely next to her husband who was blissfully sleeping. She watched his chest rise and fall with every breath and smirked quaintly at the sight of his muscle’s spasms.Such an odd dream, but she was relieved to wake up when she did. Astoria was often prone to nightmares, but that one felt almost too real. She shook her head and chalked it up to figments of her imagination.Astoria wiped her forehead and noticed her entire face was dripping with perspiration. She swung her legs off the bed and trotted into the loo to splash some cool water on her face.She sent to wipe her face but then noticed the intense scratch marks on her forearm. Her fingernails dug with hints of dried blood, but her skin felt as if it was scratched raw. “Must have been one intense dream.” She thought to herself while muttered a simple healing charm to close the wounds.Astoria felt something warm begin to trickle between her legs, and as she went to feel what it was, her fingers came back red. She rolled her eyes and realized she must be beginning her monthly menstruation. It had to be the reason for her sweating and anxious mindset. Astoria was casting various cooking charms around her kitchen. The eggs in the pan were beginning to scramble and turn brown and white. The bacon began to turn itself over, and the orange juice sat on the windowsill squeezing into the juicer.“Good morning, sweetie!”Astoria swung her head to notice Andromeda coming through the front door with a basket of herbs and flowers, along with what looked like a bag of potions.“Morning, Auntie.” Astoria said while placing a kiss upon her cheek.Moments later, a very sleepy, Draco emerged from the elongated hallway. He gave his Aunt a morning wave and summoned a cup of tea his way with his wand.“What are the plans for today, you two?”Draco peered up and Astoria and shrugged his shoulders. “Not entirely sure. Astoria has not been feeling the best lately so we might stay in—”“What’s wrong dear?” Andromeda interjected sharply while placing her hands on Astoria’s cheeks and checking for a fever.Astoria laughed and held her hands. “I’m fine. I have just been a tad dizzy lately, but I realized why last night. My period came early.”Andromeda reached into her bags of potions and held out a glass bottle with purple liquid inside. “Here. A brew of my own concoctions. It should clear up any monthly woes.”Astoria accepted the bottle gladly and thanked her kindly. Astoria felt her head pierce with pain, and her chest felt as if an elephant was laying on top. She must have caught a virus that causes fatigue and headaches, it was the only explanation. Draco was preparing to Portkey to the Nott estate, and accompany Theo for a night of drinks and “wizard time.” Which is a code for, “a night off from the wives.”Pansy would be meeting Astoria at the safehouse for a witch’s night in, but she was feeling up for anything but entertaining a guest. All she wanted to do was crawl into a hot bath and retire early.Draco had not had alone time with his best friend since before Lucius’ memorial, so Astoria knew tonight was important for him.She chalked up her pains, downed a potion Andromeda made for her, and hoped the liquid would subside her symptoms.Draco was clasping on his cufflinks and tucking his wand into his blazer pocket. Astoria sat on the couch with her head in her hand and admired his attractiveness.“I could stay y’know? I can always tell Theo to reschedule.”Astoria shook her head and wrapped her arms around her legs. “No, I want you to go. It is important for you to have Theo time.... Don’t get hit on too much though...”Draco cocked his head and squatted next to his wife on the couch and ran his hand through her hair. “I only have eyes for you...”Astoria chuckled and nudged him softly. “Indulging in ‘80s music, are we? When can I start playing Stevie Nicks loudly and proudly around here?”“When I’m dead.” He said sarcastically.“Hilarious. Go on now, you must not keep Theo waiting.”Draco placed a kiss upon her forehead, and proceeded to spend his night drinking, and reminiscing the good ol’ Hogwarts days with his eldest friend.Astoria decided that perhaps a hot bath would not be such a bad idea before Pansy arrives. She flicked her wand to fill the tub and watched the steam rise from the water.She stripped off her robe and slipped into the water. The instant burning sensation prickled her skin and sent a shiver down her spine.Astoria tilted her head back and noticed that the back of her neck began to ache, and the carving started to burn.She held the back of her neck, until she heard the one voice that sent a chill through her blood. Astoria felt her body paralyze and did not dare move a muscle.“Hello my rose.” Lord Voldemort said from behind her.Astoria was naked, and exposed, and there was nowhere to hide. She immediately clenched her legs and cradled them to her chest. There was no use in trying to use Occlumency right now, she could not focus on anything, but her bare skin exposed in front of her Master.“My—my—my Lord. Erm—what are—”“I have come for a... booster...my sweet.” He said while stroking the top of her wet hair.“Please...I have not been feeling all that well lately... my Lord...perhaps if we wait—”Without warning Voldemort seized the sides of her temples, and Astoria felt piercing pain vibrate through her body, but only after a few moments the Dark Lord ceased. Astoria spun around to witness Voldemort glaring down at her, and he ran his finger along her jawline.“Congratulations, my precious one. Soon this will all be over...” Voldemort whispered, and Disapparated from her sight.Astoria felt confused, but the pain that buzzed within her mind remained. She held onto her head and submerged herself underneath the water.When she remerged, she began to think about what her Master said to her. Why would he congratulate her? None of that made sense, and why did he not drain more youth from her like he has been doing for years? Could the Dark Lord detect her illness and realize that what he was doing was in fact killing her?No, that could not be it, because he would not congratulate her on being ill.Astoria ran her fingers down her body until she landed on her stomach. She spread her palm along her abdomen until she started to realize what the Dark Lord meant...“TORI! Where are you ya’ little one?” Pansy exclaimed as she bursted into the loo door. “Oh—what are you doing in the bath? I thought we had plans to—”“I think I am pregnant.” Astoria said with a worried expression. Pansy remained motionless, and dumbstruck.Astoria hopped out of the bath and slipped on a robe and proceeded into the kitchen. She poured herself a glass of wine and downed it almost instantly.Pansy, still not making a sound, followed her. Astoria shot her a look and asked her what her deal was.“I do not know what to say...”Astoria rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. “Well, say something, because I may go mental.”Pansy pursed her lips and began to tear. “I am happy for you, I am, I am just---”Astoria knew that Pansy and Theo had been trying to conceive for some time, and she could only imagine what sort of emotions could be flowing through her best friend right now.In this moment, she thought of her eldest friend that she let down and could never save. Astoria missed Lilla dearly, and truly had no ideas on how to rescue her from her prison. She thought about what Lilla might say to her in this moment, she would probably be freaking out just as much as Astoria is. But it would probably be along the lines of, “Oh shit, hopefully it won’t act too much like its bloody father...”However, Pansy was not freaking out, but feeling something much worse, jealousy. It was a natural reaction for anyone who felt emotion, and Astoria knew how much heartache Pansy went through with each of her miscarriages. How she desperately wanted the roles to be reversed, and have Pansy giving her this news. Pansy deserves this child more than Astoria does...“Does Draco know?” Pansy asked faintly.Astoria shook her head and scoffed. “Absolutely not. He will shit himself if he finds out...I can’t have this baby, Pans...”Pansy trotted over to her friend and placed her hands on her shoulders. “Yes, you can, Astoria. You and Draco are married, and you are well old enough—”“You don’t understand.” Astoria said regretfully while trying to exit the kitchen.Pansy seized her arm and pulled her back roughly. “What do I not understand, hm? That despite your condition you were still able to get pregnant and now you do not even want this child? You are a selfish bitch!”Astoria broke free and pushed Pansy against the icebox. “I am not selfish, you cunt! You are just jealous that I could get pregnant without trying!”Pansy began to cry, and she huffed her breath. “I am leaving. I don’t give a fuck what you do, but do yourself a favor, and discuss this with your husband. Maybe you do not want a child, but I know for a fact Draco DOES!” Pansy pushed Astoria back and was inches from her face.“I knew him long before you did, Astoria. I was there for him the first time his father beat his ass, and I was there for him the day he let you slip through the cracks. Draco is capable of handling much more than you think.” Pansy spat.Astoria wiped her face and felt her breath hiccup. Her lungs began to dry, and her throat close. She could not have this baby, it was impossible. She could not possibly have a baby...“YOU JUST DON’T GET IT!” Astoria yelled while crying uncontrollably. “HE—HE WILL take—take IT!” Astoria fell to the floor and began to rock back and forth while raking her fingers into her scalp.Pansy dropped next to her and tried to grab hold of her hands and calm her.“Shhh...please, Tori, calm down...What can I do?”Her world began to shake, and she was feeling too much too fast. The world blurred out of focus, and there was nothing to focus on. Astoria felt her mind delving deeper into herself, until she felt utterly alone... in the dark. Astoria tried to prop up her head, but the blood was rushing to quickly back to her head. Pansy held onto her friend closely, and quickly reached for a resurgent potion.Pansy forced the liquid down her throat, and immediately the color came back to Astoria’s face, and reality came back into place.Astoria sat up and wiped the saliva that trailed the edge of her chin.“Now. I demand you tell me what is going on. Who is going to try and take your baby?”Astoria felt cornered and knew she could not sweet talk her way out of revealing the horrid truth to her friend. With a deep breath she told Pansy the truth. The truth entailing what the Dark Lord has been doing to her for years, and why. Why her being pregnant is not a joyous occasion, and most importantly, Draco is unaware of it all.“How could you do this to him? How could you lie to your own husband?”Astoria scoffed and flipped her hair out of her face. “Do you think I enjoy deceiving Draco?”Pansy nodded. “Yes. I do. All you have ever known is lies and deceit, so it is natural for you to jump to that solution.”Astoria rose to her feet and slumped into a nearby armchair. “Can you stop patronizing me about how ‘in the wrong’ I am? I understand! Just drop it.”Pansy crossed her arms and huffed irritably. “No, not this time, Tori. I will not just ‘drop it’. If you do not tell Draco the truth I will. Y’know he hides nothing from you? Why can’t you give him the same kindness?”Astoria began to cry, and she wiped her tears. “Don’t you see? We have already been to hell and back. Draco thinks we are finally in peace, somewhat. How can I restart the fire of him thinking I am in danger?”Pansy grabbed hold of her hysterically crying friend and held her close.“It is not just about you this time. It’s about you, and your unborn child.”“I am not going to have this baby. I will not put it through the same torture as Lilla’s child.”Pansy hushed up for a moment in a state of confusion. Astoria built up the courage to explain what had happened to Lilla, and her own baby. Oddly enough, allowing her demons to slip through her mouth felt as if weights were slightly coming off her chest.“Where is she? Is she dead?” Pansy exclaimed loudly.Astoria scrunched her face and shrugged. “I do not think so. She is my back-up producer for my Master if I fail at giving him what he wants. If I succeed, I lose my child, and if I fail Lilla gets put through hell, again. No matter what I do, somebody gets hurt!”Suddenly, the front door of the safe house crashed open. Draco and Theo pounced in and traveled straight to their wives.Draco embraced his wife and glared into her eyes.“What’s wrong? What’s happened? Are you hurt? Either of you?” Draco exclaimed while trying to find an injury on his wife’s body.Astoria shook her head and glared at Pansy.“I sent them a Patronus telling them to get home. I sent it while you were nearly unconscious.”Astoria remained silent and more tears streamed down her cheek.“Would somebody please tell us what the bloody fuck is going on? Tori, why are you crying?” Theo said with a serious facial expression.Astoria bit her bottom lip and began to fiddle with her wedding ring. She had not felt the anxious fiddling tick for many years, so she knew in this moment she had been more nervous than she had felt in years.“Draco, Theo. I need to tell you all something...”Astoria explained to the two wizards everything regarding the Dark Lord, what he has been doing to her, but she had conveniently left out the most important detail...“And erm---there is more...” Astoria said hesitantly.“Bloody fucking Merlin, Astoria! How could you lie to me all this time! HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME!” Draco yelled down at his wife while she began to shrink further into herself.“All these years you let me believe you had a blood curse but, it was a dark fucking wizard sucking the life out of you! MY OWN WIFE! A LIAR!” He bellowed down at her which sent a chill through her frail body.Astoria covered her mouth and could not bear to meet her husbands’ eyes. He was right, and she was wrong. She knew that. Astoria figured to let Draco yell until he felt relieved, but if he was this angry about the first part of the truth, how was he going to react about the baby?“LOOK AT ME DAMMIT!” Draco yelled down at her.Astoria kept her eyes low and on her fiddled wedding rings. How beautiful they were, and how much they meant to her...
  CRASH
Astoria’s eyes shot up to witness Draco smashing a picture frame of them against the wall, and Theo holding back Draco from smashing more.“THERE I AM LOOKING AT YOU!” She said with tears streaming, and her cheeks glowing red.“ARE YOU FINISHED SMASHING OUR MEMORIES?” She yelled back in his face.Draco kept his face cold, and his fists balled at his sides. Astoria felt her blood beginning to boil, and all she wanted to do was spit in someone’s face. Yes, she lied, but that was no reason to lash out.“Nothing you say or do will make up for this.” Draco said while attempting to storm down the hallway.Astoria stood firmly and yelled. “You would really leave your wife and child?”Draco stopped in his tracks and cocked his head while keeping his back toward her.“What did you just say...”Astoria took a breath and crossed her arms. “I’m pregnant.”Draco took a moment, and finally turned around to meet her eyes. His face had changed from anger to horror. Now what were they going to do?
  
    Chapter Text
    
  2004
Draco felt like a complete arse, to say the least. How else was he supposed to react to such news? So much had been revealed to him that the last three hours felt as if three years flew by.After Astoria revealed she was pregnant with Draco’s child she stormed out and fled. She probably went to Pansy’s to sulk and discuss how Draco was a rubbish husband, or how he had no heart.Maybe he did not have a heart anymore. Every time he turned around someone he loved was getting hurt, or someone was lying to him. So many lies had been told to his face that each one took its own pound of flesh from his bones.Draco proceeded to pick off the shards of glass on the floor. He waved his wand to repair the damaged photograph, and it did not help his case that the photograph he decided to smash was the first picture they ever took together.He wanted to drown out his sorrows with a bottle of fire whisky and cracklings of the fire. However, he could not bring himself to perform such actions that felt natural to him. Being lucid during these times is the best, and the only option for him.Perhaps it would be best to lay out all the facts and try to mentally form a coherent feeling about each event.Draco could not bear to think about the one thing that was weighing on his mind the most, the fact that Astoria was pregnant, and the Dark Lord demanded it to happen. No, it would be best to start from the beginning.A few years prior Draco noticed Astoria’s weakening condition. She would become more tired when they would go on excursions or take longer walks in town. When he finally confronted her about it, she disclosed to him that a Healer told her that she developed an Ancestral Blood Curse, one that was in the family of Maledictus’ but dismay the permanent animal form. It was all fucking lies. In reality, Lord Voldemort is on the cusp of dying and has been using Astoria as his pick-him-up life source. Like a ruddy vampire. Shamefully, Draco thought to himself that he would have preferred her to have a blood curse.The next ordeal was about his unborn child. The Dark Lord ordered Astoria to become pregnant within a certain time frame, and she did it. Behind his back.After Astoria stormed out of the house, this left no time for Draco to ask her more disheartening questions. For example, why she decided to get pregnant behind his back, and when the time comes, handover their child to a dying snake wizard. None of this made sense to him. How could his own wife betray him like this?Should Draco have ran after her? Like he has countless times in the past? It appeared that when problems rose in their relationship all Astoria knew how to do was flee. A coward’s way out, that what she was acting like, a damned coward. Scared to face the damage she caused, and the hearts she has broken by her feast of lies.No, this time he was determined not to run after her. It killed him that even after all she has done to him, he still loved her. Maybe the universe was trying to tell Draco that his love for Astoria was too intoxicating.Draco looked around his house, and all he saw were memories. Many of them happy, but more recently, saddening. He needed to leave, go somewhere to clear his head.Draco grabbed his wand from his jacket pocket and walked outside so he could apparate to his desired destination.Draco landed outside the Three Broomsticks and noticed in the window the moonlit glow of his platinum hair. He had forgotten to cast the identity charm over himself before he left. But he did not care anymore, let people recognize him. He will hex anyone who comes his way. All he wanted in this moment was to be alone—“Draco Malfoy.” A familiar female voice said from behind him.Draco spun his head around and clutched his wand tight to ready an Immobilize charm. Until he saw the bushy brown hair, big brown doe-eyed Hermione Granger. He felt himself speechless and looking dumbfounded.“What a coincidence to run into you here...” She said with a smirk on her face.“Granger...”“Erm—yes. It’s me.” She said while placing both her hands in her pockets.“What are you doing here? Are you following me or something? Is the Ministry on the lookout—”“Hush up. I am here alone, and no, I was not looking for you. I had business with Minerva, and I fancied a Butterbeer in the late hour.”Draco felt as if he may faint. He had not seen Granger in well over five years, since the day of his horrid wedding ceremony and she fled the scene with the Weasel’s.He would be lying to himself if he did not find her more attractive than he did when he was a schoolboy. Granger turned into a well-kept woman. Her clothes became more professional, her hair tamed, and a sense of maturity filled her face. Draco had almost forgotten about what was troubling him... until he remembered his wife.“If you will excuse me then.” Draco said while attempting to walk towards Honey Dukes to find the hidden passage into Hogwarts.“Fancy some company?” She said serially as she caught up to him.Draco huffed and nodded while shoving his hands in his pockets. The walk towards Honey Dukes was a tad tense. What was he supposed to talk to this woman about? Was she like an old friend he was supposed to chit-chat with about the ‘good ol’ days? There were no good old days anymore. They were tainted by war and suffering.Draco stood outside Honey Dukes and waited for Hermione to say that she was going in another direction, but she broke the silence by foiling his break-into the castle plan.“If you were trying to get into Hogwarts, you could have told me... We are not children anymore Draco...There is no need to fuss with secret passages.”Without warning Hermione seized Draco’s arm and before he could form a coherent thought, he was outside the castle walls.He glared up at the structure that once brought him much joy, but it was different in many ways. Draco noticed the very spot that Astoria casted the inferno spell upon the castle, and he noticed how wizards attempted to reconstruct the walls, but it was not the same.“I think this is the part where I leave you, Granger. You will not want to be seen with me if someone recognizes me... they may—”“No one is here except the Headmistress and a few other professors. School does not commence for another few weeks. Come on.”He was not being pulled or ordered, but he felt compelled to walk with her. As he walked the halls with his once school-love it felt more peaceful than he could have imagined.Perhaps this was the universe telling him that his life was Astoria was too messy and all he was looking for was being shoved in his face as his life went on. He did not want to believe such notions, but he could not fathom how his own wife lied to him for years.“Fancy a stroll up to the Astronomy Tower? I recall you having an infatuation with its solitude.”Hermione and Draco strolled up the spiral staircase until he saw the one place, he missed most of all in his life, but also the one place that changed his life forever. He found himself standing in the very spot where he murdered his late Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.Draco glared over to notice Hermione pulled a flask from her coat and downing a quick gulp. Interesting, has PTSD caused her to become a raging alcoholic, like him?It must had been his curious facial expression because she laughed lowly to herself. “Would you believe me if I told you, I carried this around to keep me warm?”“Absolutely not.” He clipped.She held out the flask to him and he graciously accepted. As the liquid touched his lips, he noticed she was drinking Muggle Gin.Hermione stretched her arms out over the railing and Draco did the same. He glared over at the witch next to him, and he noticed her left hand. Hermione’s left ring finger hugged a wedding band. Quickly, Hermione noticed his glance and tried to hide her hand but gave up and nodded.“You can ask.” She said flatly.“Who is the lucky git that swept you off your feet?”Hermione laughed and bit her bottom lip. “George Weasley.”Draco could not help himself, he burst into a laugh and nodded.“I always knew you would end up a Weasel. Quite typical of you.”Hermione nudged his shoulder but her expression remained disappointed. Draco could see how she felt about her life just by the way her eyes wandered. The once vivacious, studious, stubborn girl that he once knew was gone. She became a different woman in the last five years, just as he became a different man.“It was not by choice, trust me.” She muttered while staring at her rings.“Are you saying you were forced to marry him?” Draco said sternly with a more concerned expression.“No, and yes. I don’t know.” She stuttered.What does that even mean? Being forced to marry somebody but at the same time not?“George is kind. After the battle we mourned over the people we lost...” he glared at Draco suddenly and back down at the railing. “We understand one another, and he loves me for who I am. I am fond of him, but—”“You do not love him.” Draco clipped.Hermione shook her head.“I know the look you get on your face when you do love someone. Like a fiery passion, almost.” Draco spoke softly.“Is that same look present in this moment?” She whispered as she began to lean in. Draco glared at her face carefully. He watched as her eyes begged for him to lean in and connect their lips. Granger’s face was hopeful as her hand wandered over to his.“Yes.” He purred.Hermione attempted to lean in and kiss him, but he stopped her by pulling away intently. He was not going to dance this dance with her anymore. Even after all these years, only one woman remained in his head, and she was not present in this moment.Draco knew what the consequences would be if he allowed himself to travel down this path with Granger. He would ultimately be sacrificing Astoria, his child and possibly his friends. Once upon a time he would have moved Heaven and Earth for this witch, but that was a tale as old as time.“I am sorry. That was foolish of me.” Hermione said while adjusting her posture.“I think I would prefer if you would leave me now. I came here to clear my head and think.” Draco said.Hermione began to walk towards the staircase until Draco noticed her stride coming to a halt. She turned her head and looked as if she wanted to say more but was having difficulty forming words.“As much as you want too, you cannot protect her. You never could.” Hermione said with hints of regret in her voice.The irony in her words were that Draco knew that already. Astoria was never one to be saved because there is no such thing as saving someone who is connected with the Dark Lord. Even Saint fucking Potter could not overthrow him.The ruddy Gryffindor got his throat slit before he could even challenge him to a duel. No, Astoria was different, she never needed to be saved but she always survived, with or without help.Draco spun around and began to laugh lowly to himself while nodding his head. “Y’know you were always the clever one Granger. Maybe I do not have the power to save my wife anymore, but it is not only about her anymore.”Hermione lowered her head and folded her arms. “You do not have to do this to yourself. There is another option.”“Like what? Desert my responsibilities? Run away?” He spat while glaring into her doe-eyes.Hermione stood her ground and nodded. “Yes! With me! You know I will never stop pining for you. I am mature enough to realize she is no good for you. All she brings into your life is heartache!”Was she wrong? No, she was not. It was no surprise to Draco that wherever Astoria stood, darkness and lies followed. Whichever path she would choose to take, Lord Voldemort would be in the corner of her shadow.Draco was in love with Astoria, beyond his words, but he has been waltzing in darkness with her for merely a decade. Was enough, enough?“Look at me, Malfoy and tell me you want to be tethered to a monster for the rest of your days.”Draco glared down at his left hand and noticed that his wedding band was off, it was gone. As Astoria stormed out of the house, he remembers tossing it against the mantle of the fireplace. A regretful action, indeed.He walked over to Granger and regarded her, how she looked, how she stood and how she smelled. Nothing about this woman drew him in like it used too. The only eyes he wanted looking back at him were not present right now.“You’re not her... Granger.” He whispered.A single tear fell from Hermione’s left eye, and she nodded softly.“I could try to be her...if you let me...” She said breathlessly.“You are who you are. Do not change yourself for someone who does not pine for you any longer...”Hermione stood in silence for a moment, and she glared up at Draco’s face. Her eyes looked defeated, but he knew that she understood that she would never be what he needed.Hermione bolted for the staircase but came to an abrupt stance. “You are going to be a great father.”The bushy hair fled down the stairs and out of his sight. Did everyone know about the news of the pregnancy before he did? Bloody Merlin. After an hour or so of silent thinking, Draco decided it was time to chalk it up and head back home. Draco was descending from the stairs when yet another familiar face from his past appeared in front of him.“Mr. Malfoy.”Draco looking stunned and a little afraid choked out the only word he could fathom. “Erm---”“Come with me.” Minerva said coldly.Minerva spoke the password for her office and the staircase revealed itself behind the eagle statue. As he ascended the stone stairs, memories flashed before him. How many times had he been sent to see Dumbledore about teasing the first-year Gryffindor’s? About a dozen.“Sit.” She spat.Draco did as she ordered and felt himself more nervous than he ever had been sitting in the very seat.“Why are you here?”Draco shifted in his seat and reached for the back of his neck. “I came here to... think.”“To think? Could you not do that in the comforts of your own home?” She sneered.Yeesh, this woman was not thrilled to see an old student of hers. Perhaps she was still upset with him about murdering her colleague or how his wife set fire to the castle?“With all do respect, Professor, I was brought here. I did not break in.”Minerva rose her eyebrows and leaned in against her desk, looking more intrigued than ever. “Go on.”“I originally traveled to Hogsmeade. I presume going there is not forbidden?” He clipped. “Then I ran into your Golden Girl.”“Miss Granger?” She said, surprisingly.“Aye, the very same.” Draco said sarcastically.Minerva rose from her chair and proceeded to regard the various sleeping portraits that hung on her office walls. Draco noticed the portrait of Dumbledore sleeping just on the side of him. He thought to himself how lucky he was that his old Headmaster would sleep through this ‘visit’.“Professor I think I should be getting back home...” Draco began to rise but Minerva’s glare darted to him.“I advise you Mister Malfoy not to return to this castle. You are not regarded in high light around here. Frankly, I have not forgotten past events.” She sneered. “However, I do respect the efforts you and Astoria are putting forth for The Order. Which is why I advise you... do not come back here.”It felt like a punch in the gut. To be banished from the one place that he could think freely. The one place in which he grew up and shared countless laughs. The castle in which he met Astoria, he was no longer welcome in.Draco made his way off the castle grounds and as he had his wand in hand, yet another voice spoke from behind him.“Draco.”“Bloody fucking Merlin, I am leavin—!” Draco stopped to witness Severus Snape standing behind him with a concerned look upon his face.“Severus? What are you—”“Its Astoria. I come to you out of the sake of her life. Go to her.” He sneered coldly.Without hesitation Draco ran off the Hogwarts grounds so he could apparate and suddenly he stood on the outside of the blood wards of the safehouse. He sliced his palm to sacrifice blood for re-entry.As he entered the house, Astoria stood with an empty potion bottle in her hand and a look of dread on her face. She fell to the floor, but Draco swept to the ground to catch her.Draco tried to regain her consciousness, but she was unresponsive.“Astoria! Wake up! My darling! I am sorry.... please wake up... please my... Astoria... I am sorry I was such an arse... but I am home now, please... wake up.” He cried as he cradled her closely.Draco felt hopeless, he was always hopeless. He was no Healer; he could not save her. He attempted to smell what potion she took but was unable to detect the substance inside. Draco held onto his wife closely and how he did not want this. If he had known what was going on, he would not have left this house. He would have stayed and awaited her return, talked to her about the pregnancy, calm her nerves.Granger was right, he could not save her. She was beyond saving...Suddenly, Draco’s left forearm began to burn, and he knew what that meant. The Dark Lord was summoning the Death Eaters... Maybe this was his chance to save his wife. A ruddy idea, but it was the only one he had. Surely, the Dark Lord would not let Astoria die?Draco held onto Astoria tightly and touched his wand to his Dark Mark. The couple was disapparated into a field of darkness, and the only sound were the night crickets.“HELP HER!” He bellowed out.The Dark Lord showed himself from behind a giant oak tree and smiled. Where were the other Death Eaters? Why was nobody else arriving?“ASTORIA IS GOING TO DIE!” Draco cried out as he held onto her. He could hear her breathing becoming scarcer with every moment passing.“What will you give me in return, Draco?”Draco laughed almost pathetically and dropped to his knees.“You already have my wife and my child. What more could you desire?” He spat.Voldemort tilted his head up and smirked. The Dark Lord gripped onto Draco’s platinum hair and yanked his neck to meet his eyes. Suddenly, Draco felt strands of his hair being pulled from the roots. Voldemort took his hair and tucked it away inside his robes.  The Dark Lord knelt beside Astoria’s limp, and weakening body. He summoned the liquid of the potion from her mouth, and it fell to the ground. She began to cough up the remnants, and Draco held onto her firmly.Voldemort nodded his head and disapprated from them abruptly.Astoria’s eyes cracked open to see Draco glaring down at her with such worry. A small smile came across his mouth and he embraced her tightly.“I thought you were dead...” He said.“Sorry I scared you...” She said lowly.Draco helped Astoria to her feet and firmly asked her what potion she took, and how Severus knew to command Draco to rescue her.Astoria folded her arms in embarrassment and began to reveal what she had been doing while she stormed out...          Astoria ran from the house with tears in her eyes and intent in her heart. She knew what she had to do, and she knew just the place to go to find such a substance to aid in her plan. 
            She yanked out her wand and apparated to Spinner’s End. She glared up at the bricks and remembered the time she spent here while she was under Snape’s ‘protection.’ 

  Too much was running through her head. Thoughts of sadness, regret, embarrassment, and anger. If Draco did not want to have this child, then she was going to grant his wish. 

  Astoria knew this was the best decision for not only Draco, but for the unborn fetus. The moment it is born, it will be handed over to her Master. What kind of monster could she be to willingly hand over her child? This would be better for everyone if it all simply ended. 

  “Alohomora...” She muttered and to her surprise the door sprung open. Odd that Snape has not developed some heftier wards for his home. 

  She ran to his potions storage area and looked for that one beauty that would aid her. After countless bottle readings, she discovered the one little container she needed, tucked away in the back, hidden from searching eyes. 

  “I’m sorry, baby.” She whispered to herself as she tucked the potion into her satchel. 

  As she was walking out of the closet, Severus appeared in her way. 

  “Dropping by?” He sneered. 

  Astoria felt her heart race, and her stomach drop to the floor. 

  “I—I erm---came for...” She stuttered. 

  “I understand your predicament, Miss Greengrass. However, that potion will not—” 

  “I need to try.” She clipped. “I am a heartless wretch if I allow this child to be handed over...” She felt tears stream down her face, and she founded herself holding the bottom of her stomach. 

  “You are a grown woman, and I will not stop you. However, head my warning stupid girl, that potion will do more damage than you understand.” 

  Astoria nodded and walked passed him without a passing thought. She walked outside and apparated back to her home. Astoria clutched the potion in her hand, and attempted several times to down it, but failed.

  She fell to the floor in agony with eyes pooling with tears. What was she doing? How did her life become this? Would she lose Draco over this? Does Draco even still love her? Maybe it was best if they both took their exit from the world and allowed him to peace. 

  Astoria clutched the tiny potion bottle and downed it to the very last drop. The burning sensation skimmed her throat, and her belly felt like fire. 

  Her eyes were becoming dark...and her mind must have been playing tricks on her because she thought she saw someone running towards her...Astoria felt her stance becoming unbalanced. Before her eyes went black. 

   
Draco clutched onto his wife and held her more tightly than he ever had. She was alive, their child was alive...and for now...that was enough.“I... I did not do this on purpose...I...I...” Astoria croaked out as she clutched onto Draco’s cloak.Draco finally understood that Astoria did not have a diabolical plan for this pregnancy. Everything that happened to her, them, was in the hands of Merlin, and the Gods.Draco nodded his head and pulled away the strands of hair from her face. He connected their lips softly and he whispered, “I know.”

  2004
Astoria was lying on her back when she felt the tingling sensation develop between her legs. She closed her eyes tightly and gripped onto the pillows that held her head.The hairs on her arm began to stand as the prickle affect ran down her spine with every movement she felt on her throbbing clitoris.How badly she wanted to unravel instantly, but she felt the feeling of compressing. Astoria ran her hand down her body to grip onto the head that was giving her such pleasure, until she felt the hump of her growing belly.Her eyes snapped open, and she felt embarrassed, and larger than she ever felt in her life.“Stop. I—I feel like a giant Hippogriff.” Astoria said while attempting to close her legs, but Draco seized them in place.“Impossible.” Draco said while his head was between her swollen legs.Draco continued his tongue motions on her clitoris, while occasionally planting soft kisses along the insides of her thighs.“You have never looked more radiate.” He purred.The sounds of his voice, and the breath against her labia made the heat of her body build... until...there was an explosion. The muscles of her abdomen tensed while her toes curled.As Astoria came down from her climax, Draco joined her once more at the top of the bed.“Do not call yourself a Hippogriff. You are anything but.” Draco said while planting a kiss on her cheek.“A little owl once told me you provoked a Hippogriff, and the beast kicked your---”“Preposterous! That creature attacked me.” He said firmly.Astoria laughed to herself and rose from the bed to drape a silk robe around her body. She looked at her side from a side view in her mirror and noticed how her body looked more different with every passing day.Her breasts became larger and more tender. The soles of her feet became acheful by night, and she could not stand more than an hour before needing a rest. Astoria’s belly grew larger every week, and she has not come to terms with such events yet.Draco seemed to be coming around more than she was. He was determined not to hand over his wife or child to the Dark Lord, no matter the cost.          “Astoria, we cannot change what is already done. All we can do is protect—” Draco proceeded to place his hand upon Astoria’s belly. “—what is ours.” 
            Astoria felt a tear stream down her cheek, but she nodded. It may not be what she wanted at this time in her life, but there was no turning back now. 
 The next morning Andromeda arrived at the house early to give Astoria a routine examination. Andromeda waved her wand and casted multiple maternal diagnostic charms on her.“The child is growing strong. I daresay, another five weeks and you’ll deliver.” Andromeda said while rotating her wand around her belly to get a better view of the fetus.“Oi! I know the sex. It is a—”“Don’t tell me.” Astoria said firmly while shaking her head.Andromeda lowered her eyes and nodded. In truth, Astoria did not want to know the sex due to attachment. If she found out if it was a boy or a girl, then she would be asking herself the ‘What if?’ questions.What if they look like Draco?What if they inherit Astoria’s big brown eyes?What if Draco and Astoria are unable to save their child from Lord Voldemort.“I think a home-birth will be quite sufficient. I have delivered countless babies before, however there is the issue with the wards...”Astoria knew what Andromeda was referring to. The Nott Safehouse was built to keep out all muggles, and unwanted wizarding folk. But the wards were not nearly strong enough to keep out the Dark Lord while Astoria is giving birth.“We will need to relocate you and soon. If you and Draco want a real shot at saving this child.”Astoria peered up at Draco and he nodded his head.“What about The Order? Is there no proper safehouse they will aid us with?” Draco spat while folding his arms.Andromeda hesitated and eventually shook her head. “Unfortunately, due to the delicacy of Astoria’s situation The Order members will not supply a properly warded escape. May I suggest relocating with the Nott’s? Perhaps they—”“Absolutely not. I will not put Theo or Pansy in such danger when the time comes. They have aided us enough for two lifetimes.” Astoria clipped while sitting up on her elbows.Andromeda began to clasp on her cloak and prepare her wand to apparate.“Then I suggest you two put your heads together and figure out a solution. Otherwise, you may as well leave your front door wide open.” Andromeda said sternly.Andromeda gave Astoria a hug and peck on the cheek before repeating the same motion with Draco before making her exit.Everything seemed hopeless, yet again. Just when Astoria thinks she can gain an inch away from her Master, he is already a foot in front of her.Where in the world was safe enough for Draco and Astoria to go until she needed to deliver? Was there even such a place that existed?While Astoria was debating with herself on how doomed she felt, she noticed Draco pacing in deep thought. Perhaps he had an idea.“What’s going on in that stubborn head of yours?” Astoria said while swinging her legs off the side of the bed.Draco knelt in front of her. “I do have a thought, but it is mad, and I am not sure if we will be able to pull it off.”“What are you thinking?”Draco hesitated and took a deep breath. “What if we hid you in Hogwarts?”Astoria felt stunned and taken aback. Hide in Hogwarts? Was it even possible?Hogwarts was a school, and not a suitable place for a pregnant woman. This was also the school she nearly burnt to the ground, so to go back and use it for her aid felt horribly wrong.Astoria was about to speak to decline the proposal, but she felt something inside her belly begin to flutter or kick. Then it kicked some more. Astoria gasped and her hand flung to her belly.“What is it? What’s wrong?” Draco said sternly while placing his hand on hers.“It—it—erm—moved. I have felt this once before, but I was unsure what it was until now.” Astoria was breathlessly. She gazed into Draco’s hopeful eyes and knew his plan, was the only plan that was worth a shot.Draco held his hand on Astoria’s belly for a few moments in silence. It seemed he was as just in awe as she was.“Please. I need you both safe.” He pleaded.Astoria lowered her head and chalked back the immediate tears.She nodded her head and cracked a smile. “Any idea how we are going to penetrate the castle?”“Severus.”“Why in Merlin’s beard would Severus help us? I have broken into his home, deceived him countless times, and—”Draco lowered his head and grabbed onto both Astoria’s hands. “I do not see another option, sweetheart.” He said almost pathetically.Astoria was about to protest once more until the green flames of their fireplace were set ablaze. Theo and Pansy scrambled through looking as if they were having a difficult discussion amongst themselves as well just moments prior.“Nott. Pansy. What is it? What is wrong?” Draco said sternly while shaking Theo’s hand and placing a soft greeting kiss on Pansy’s cheek.Pansy gripped onto Theo’s arm and looked as if she could either burst into a puddle of tears or hide under the nearest bed.“It’s happening. They are after us. All of us.” Pansy said with a shaky tone.Astoria stepped forward and placed both her hands on Pansy’s shoulders to try and reassure her that in this house, she was safe. “Who is they exactly?”Theo made direct eye-contact with Draco, and he (Draco) looked as if he knew what Theo was about to say next.“The Ministry. They are actively tracking down known followers of the Dark Lord. They’ve captured Dolohov this morning and Macnair last night... followed by...” Theo lowered his head and pinched his temple. “...my father as well. He was captured along with Dolohov.”“Bloody fucking Merlin.” Astoria said breathlessly as she held a hand on her chest.Astoria felt the air had left her lungs and her chest had been crushed. It has been nearly six years since the Battle of Hogwarts, and the Ministry was still actively seeking Death Eaters.“Has the Dark Lord given word on anything, have you heard anything?” Draco said coldly.Theo shook his head and gripped onto Pansy’s hand. “For now, Pansy and I are safe. We are not known followers, but my father’s involvement helps us not. But, mate, you and Astoria are in far deeper shit than the rest of us.” Theo said with hints of hurt in his voice.Astoria knew the consequences of being a follower of the Dark Lord, but at this stage of her life, she wanted nothing more but to have no Master. But the Ministry of Magic would never see her or Draco’s side, not after all this time. The woman who was witnessed burning down a historic school of magic and was also seen at Voldemort’s right hand when Harry Potter got his throat cut. To top it all off, she was Draco Malfoy’s wife. The assassin of Albus Dumbledore.“Theo’s right, it is not safe for us anymore. Call Severus. Arrange the transfer.” Astoria said to Draco calmly.As Draco proceeded to write a letter to Severus explaining what they needed, Astoria filled in Theo and Pansy on their plans to hide out in Hogwarts.“I think its brilliant!” Theo said proudly.“I think its dangerous.” Pansy said sternly while glaring at her husband. “You cannot hide their forever. Plus, that place is crawling with students and staff. What are you going to do? Hide out with the Grey Lady until the Ministry clears both your names?”“Maybe. Yes.” Astoria said while leaning back in her armchair.As the night fell, and the moonlight shined off the walls. Pansy and Theo decided to stay the night where they knew they would be protected by Blood Wards.Astoria nearly fell asleep on Draco’s shoulder when a brown and black owl swopped in from the window and landed on their coffee table. There was a parchment in its mouth.Draco grabbed the letter and tossed a scrap for the owl and watched it fly from his midst. He tore open the letter and scanned the words carefully. Astoria nudged his arm and wondered what the letter said.Draco handed Astoria the parchment and she read aloud to the group.          Draco,           I feel this idea is unnecessary but given the circumstances you two may have no choice. I am pleased to hear Astoria’s efforts to terminate her life, or the fetus’ proved to be unsuccessful. What a stupid girl you married, Draco. I am not unaware of the circumstance with the Ministry, but we will need to wait for the Christmas Break, until the students have returned home for holiday. On the 18th of December I will send you a means of transport. 
  Do not misuse my generosity. 

  S.S.
“The 18th? That’s... that is in four days.” Theo said shockingly. The night of the transfer came more swiftly than anticipated. Astoria grew more uncomfortable with her body, and Andromeda told her to keep her stress levels down, how was that ever possible?Astoria sat at her dresser mirror and regarded herself in the mirror. “This is not how I imagined my life” she thought to herself.When she was a girl and imagined how she would be spending her life, nothing like this popped into her mind. Where did it all go wrong? The day she was born or the day she chose dark over light? Did she ever have a choice in which path to take in life?She had hoped to spend the majority of her days painting and creating artwork for people to enjoy and cherish. Nowadays she could barely pick up a brush without wanting to paint something dreary.So much of the person she once was, was gone.On the other side of her mind stood the wanting of learning who she could still become. A loving wife, a strong witch and possibly a mother?Astoria never took into consideration the type of mother she would be. One matter was for sure, she was not going to let any dark wizards take her child away from her, even if that meant sacrifice.“Let’s go. Severus is waiting for us.” Draco announced.Astoria nodded and proceeded to clasp her cloak around her neck. She walked down the hallway of the place she called home for awhile until she passed the enchanted portrait of Draco and herself.As she looked at the still portraits she wondered if that version of herself was happy. The portrait would not come to life until Draco or she passed over, but it would be helpful to have a discussion with ‘herself’ about decisions. Perhaps one day she will receive answers to all her burning questions.“Ready?” Draco asked while placing a piece of Astoria’s hair behind her ear.Astoria took one last look at the house, and back at her husband. She gave a soft nod and held onto his hand tightly.Draco proceeded to pull his wand from his cloak pocket and raised it to apparate.
  CRACK 
Astoria snapped open her eyes to feel the snow kissing her face, and the moon shining her world.“We are going in through the secret passage in the Shrieking Shack. Severus will meet us outside the Whomping Willow.”Astoria had heard tails of what the Whomping Willow was, even one that included a car had crashed into it many years prior. But who would be daft enough to drive a car into an enchanted tree?“Are you scared?” Astoria asked as she noticed Draco looking uneasy.Draco shook his head but kept his eyes forward. “No. We are doing this for the good of our family. I will always protect you.”As Astoria walked further beyond the shadows, she came to witness the place where she once tried to regain her freedom from the Dark Lord. She found herself stopping in her path, unable to move further.“I am sorry, sweetheart. This is difficult for me as well. I promise, nothing will ever take me away from you again.”  Draco said while placing a soft kiss upon her lips.Astoria clasped her hands around his neck and pulled him in for a tight embrace. She felt his warmth engorge her cold body, and noticed her anxiety was cooling down.The floors still creaked inside the old building, many animals made these walls their home, and the stairs still felt unstable to walk on. Astoria popped her head through the doorway of the very room Draco and Hermione tried to change the magic of her imprint. She felt a strong shiver down her spine the more she looked in the room.Draco pulled her away softly and led her back downstairs to the hidden passage to the Whomping Willow. Nothing about this situation was settling easy for Astoria. What if she or Draco were found in the castle? Everything they have worked for would be for not.The light of the moon could be seen at the end of the passage and Astoria felt her heart race as she knew soon, she would be back inside Hogwarts.Draco assisted Astoria out of the hole of the Whomping Willow and Severus was waiting casually with his posture stiff, and his hands clasped in front.“Follow me.” Severus spat.Severus led the couple to one of the unoccupied entrances of the castle, but it was more known to the students if they wanted to sneak out after hours. Astoria remembers using this entrance once or twice to paint down near the Black Lake after dark.“Be quiet. Even though the students have gone for Christmas, some staff remain here.”Draco clutched onto Astoria’s hand firmly as they walked the dark, dim halls of Hogwarts. She felt a tear roll down her cheek when she felt the portraits’ eyes on her. Was there a way they knew who she was?“Parseltongue.” Severus murmured the password to the Slytherin common room. “Draco, I do believe your old quarters are unoccupied by students, so you should be safe to stay in there.”Draco nodded and held out his hand to Severus, he took it willingly. “Thank you, Professor. You have done us a great kindness.”Snape nodded sharply and Astoria strutted forward to place a soft kiss upon his cheek, which caused him to falter back. “Thank you, Severus. My father would be proud to know that you helped his daughter.”“Do not take advantage of my kind gesture, Miss Greengrass.”Astoria rolled her eyes and nodded. She and Draco proceeded back up the stairs to find their chamber and all the school memories flooded her mind.The room had barely changed. The two four-poster beds were still there. The window showed the fish in the Black Lake.“Erm—Draco if you had not noticed. I am almost the size of a thestral. How are we going to both sleep in that tiny bed?” Astoria said with a hint of humor.Draco waived his wand and the two-four-poster bed fused together to make a king-sized bed. The sheets felt like silk and the pillows felt as soft as a cloud.Astoria scooched over to her husband to snuggle against his chest. His hand began to rub the top of her shoulders into her hair.“If I ask you a question, will you give me an honest answer?”  Astoria asked while popping her hand under her chin.Draco furrowed his brows. “Of course.”Astoria took a deep breath and lowered her eyes. “What if—if he takes our child. What are we—gonna’—gonna’—” Astoria began to stutter until Draco closed his arms around her.“It won’t happen. You are my life. That is my child you are carrying. I will sooner die then hand either of you over, again.” Draco said with confidence.Astoria nuzzled her face in his chest and wanted to live in this moment for as long as she could. This moment when she felt safe behind the walls of the castle.Astoria was safe...she was with Draco...the anxiety that filled her mind began to fade...and she felt herself fading...into the darkness of sleep...her eyes finally closing to have a... peaceful night. Astoria felt her legs become immobile and her head unable to move the way she intended. All she could use were her words.“Where...where is he? Tell me! Somebody! I need... I need to know where my husband is...” She croaked out.Astoria felt her neck being tilted back and a potion being forced down her throat. Suddenly, the pain she was experiencing faded, and her body felt lighter.“Alright....stay with me sweetheart...just a few more moments of pain...” A voice said faintly from around her.Astoria looked up to see nothing but bright lights, and gray walls. She rolled her head over to see the familiar face of her best friend, Lilla.“You got this.” Lilla whispered.Astoria’s eyes snapped open to witness the green walls of the Slytherin dorms, and the feeling of silk sheets from beneath her body. Her heart raced, and her forehead dripped with sweat.It was just a dream, whatever it was. Nothing more.Astoria swung her legs over the bed and felt an uncomfortable pain on her bladder. The baby felt like it shifted in the night, and now all the pressure felt low.Draco was still sleeping, and snoring. Astoria glared out the window to see the Giant Squid enjoying himself within the lake.“Happy Christmas, darling.” Draco said faintly with a cracked smile.Astoria glared back and wished him a happy Christmas.“You have never looked more beautiful.” He purred while pulling her closer to him with a hand on her face, and another on her belly.“Where do you suppose we will be next Christmas? Hiding in a cave?” Astoria joked.Draco shrugged and swung his legs over the bed. “Or maybe even a tent. You never know with us.” He said with a wink.Draco reached into a dresser drawer to pull out a poorly wrapped present and handed it to his wife. “This is for you.”Astoria smiled and felt awful because she had nothing for him in return. She figured with their intended isolation there was no need for gifts. All they needed was each other.She tore open the wrapping paper to reveal a small jewelry box. Inside the box was an emerald necklace with a diamond chain. Similar, to the emerald necklace she misplaced long ago...“It’s... it’s...gorgeous...” Astoria said breathlessly.“This necklace is special. When you hold it close to your heart, you can see through my eyes.” Draco said while reaching into his pocket to show her the gem on his new wedding band. “These two emeralds are sisters. Both cut of the same rock. When I touch the emerald, I can see through your eyes. We will never lose one another...”Astoria felt blown away by his gift. It was perfect. Something to keep them together and always connected. Even if life forced them apart.Astoria felt the child inside her womb kick, and she gasped. She took Draco’s hand to place on her belly, and he smiled as he felt their child move.“I think he likes it too...” Astoria said.Draco cocked his head and smiled. “He? Have you not told me something?”Astoria shook her head and laughed. “I think he’s a boy. He’s strong and stubborn like his father...”Draco placed a kiss on her belly and glared into her eyes. “I think it’s a girl... I would not mind being shared by two beautiful girls...”Astoria placed a soft kiss on his lips and smiled. “You are all mine Draco Malfoy.”“And you are mine...Astoria Malfoy.” Roaming about the Slytherin common room proved to get boring after a while. There was not much to do once drinking was done for the night. Astoria often found herself sipping on wine at night, and Draco lectured her for it. She read through almost all the books and did not want to go through the collection once more.The couple played almost twenty rounds of Wizards chess, and Draco won most of them. Although when they were playing for incentive, it made it more fun. Mainly sexual incentive, but what else was there to bet?Astoria grew more uncomfortable with her body everyday and did not want to partake in intercourse anymore, even though Draco tried several times.Once nightfall came then there was time for possibility. To leave the common room and roam the halls, even though Snape forbid it.          “If you are caught then I will not hesitate to turn you both into the Ministry myself!” Snape sneered coldly.Astoria and Draco crawled through the painting where the common room behind laid hidden. They roamed through the dungeons, and into the kitchens to catch a midnight snack. However, there seemed to be some late-night workers...“Erm—pardon me but Winky is asking who you both are and why you are eating the muffins Winky made?” The small house elf said hesitantly.Astoria coughed up the muffin she was eating and knelt to the tiny creature. “Apologies Winky...my name is...erm---call me Tori...and this is my husband...” Astoria extended her hand to shake with Winky, but the elf faltered back while clutching into her rag clothes.“Winky knows who you are Draco Malfoy. Winky knows the Malfoy family owned Winky’s friend Dobby.  Winky wonders why you have returned to Hogwarts?”Draco placed his hand on Astoria’s shoulder while she remained at the elf’s eye-level. “For protection. The Ministry is attempting to capture me and—”“You killed Dumbledore.” Winky said quietly while lowering her eyes.Astoria glared at Draco who looked as if this tiny elf shoved a blade into his chest. “It wasn’t by choice.” Draco sneered.“Winky thinks Tori and Draco are bad people... Do Draco and Tori still follow the...Dark...Dark...Lord...” Winky said while blowing her nose into her rags.Astoria lowered her head and felt her eyes beginning to pool. She went to touch her runic imprint on the back of her neck while placing one hand on her throbbed belly. Winky’s eyes grew wide.“Is Tori having a baby?” Winky said with bright eyes.Astoria nodded and placed Winky’s hand on her belly. “This is why we have come back.”Winky hesitated to keep her hand on Astoria’s belly but after a few moments the tiny elf looked happier then she ever has. Draco knelt beside his wife and made eye-level contact with Winky.“Winky understands now.”“I was very fond of Dobby. He was my friend when I did not have anyone. When my father would...discipline me...Dobby was always there to lift my spirits.” Draco said while clasping his hand with his wife’s.“Winky misses Dobby every day...and Harry Potter....Hermione Granger...but Winky has seen Hermione Granger recently...which makes Winky happy...Hermione Granger attempts to help the house elf’s whenever she can.”Astoria’s eyes shot to Draco’s. Hermione was here, in the castle, sometime recently. But why? Why would she return to Hogwarts after all this time? Perhaps work permitted it, or she was here for nostalgia reasons?“Can I come back to visit you again Winky? Would that be, okay?” Astoria asked kindly.Winky eyes brightened and widened, she immediately placed her hand back on Astoria’s belly. “Winky wishes to see Tori and Draco again! Winky has made friends!”Draco guided Astoria out of the kitchens with a belly full of muffins, and love filled in their hearts. But there was one last place to visit before the dawn rose from the night.“It’s just as I remember it.” Astoria said quietly.“Yes...it is...” Draco said while placing a cloak around his wife.Draco and Astoria stood at the railing of the Astronomy Tower and glared out onto the grounds of Hogwarts. Some of the structure had changed about the castle, but the grounds remained the same.The Black Lake still shined against the moonlight, the grasslands still swayed with the wind, and the company had not changed.“Y’know we cannot hide here forever.” Astoria confessed.Draco let out a sigh and shook his head. “I have been thinking. If we cannot escape the Ministry, we could flee to the United States.”Astoria shot him a look, but a look of surprisal. Go to the United States? Who in their right bloody mind would choose America over Europe or Britain? There was no culture in the United States...no traditions...but most importantly...no British Ministry of Magic.“I don’t know. Escape to America? Why not France...or...or...Sicily? Those would be much better than—”“There is no war with the Dark Lord in the United States. There are plenty of secluded areas we could hide, or we could hide in plain sight...” Draco said hesitantly. “I researched some of the largest areas of the United States. Our best chance is to hide in plain sight, in New York City.”Astoria had heard of New York City and read about the many advancements people have made in that city. Perhaps it was cultured, and it would be an adequate place to hide, for a short period of time?“Can we discuss this more later? Let’s not make such a hasty decision.” Astoria said with a hint of plea.“Of course.” Draco clipped. A week after Christmas came New Years Eve and the couple was preparing to share their first moments of 2005 with each other. Draco desperately wanted to spend his New Year’s outside, next to the Black Lake on the Giant Oak, but Astoria felt his plan had a few holes.“Its too dangerous. What if the other professors are around and see you? We have gotten lucky thus far, but I do not think we should press our luck...” Astoria said with her arms crossed not budging an inch.Draco was clasping his cloak and tucking his wand into his pocket. He placed his hands on her shoulders and tried to talk her into going ahead with his plan.“I want to share the first moments of the New Year with the woman I love. Come now, we will be fine. I promise!” Draco said followed by a kiss on her for head.Astoria finally gave in and wrapped the cloak around her body. Draco and Astoria walked through the hall, hand in hand, but the air felt shifted. The halls were almost too silent.Astoria did not like this feeling at all. Even the baby felt as if it was doing somersaults inside.“Please...lets go back to the common room.” Astoria pleaded.Draco shook his head as he peered around a corner to check for professors. “Where’s your sense of adventure Mrs. Malfoy?”Astoria chuckled lowly and nodded. “Fine. Come on.”Draco and Astoria ascended down the main staircase, past the Great Hall, and almost arrived at the final staircase of the castle, until they heard voices up ahead.Draco and Astoria halted in their place and proceeded to hide behind a nearby door to wait for the voices to fade.The voices became more apparent with every second that past. Astoria’s heart leaped into her throat, and she felt Draco’s pulse through his hand. If they were caught in this castle there is no telling what the outcome would be.“I think the coast is clear. I do not hear anyone anymore.” Draco whispered.He took Astoria’s hand once more and guided her out of the darkness and attempted to proceed through the main doors. Until someone walked up behind them.“Good evening.” Minerva said coldly.Astoria and Draco stood paralyzed with fear, and anxiety. They were caught, by the Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall.“Professor...” Astoria said breathlessly.“Draco and Astoria Malfoy. As I live and breathe, standing here before me, in the very castle you both tried to destroy.” Minerva sneered coldly.Astoria stepped forward. “It was never my intent to hurt anyone or destroy anything!”“I hardly believe that.” Minerva clipped as her eye gaze shifted to Draco. “I thought I advised you never to step foot back in the castle, Draco.”Draco lowered his gaze and nodded. “I had no choice.” He placed a hand on Astoria’s belly. “I did it to protect my family.”Minerva’s eyes widened quickly, but then she shut her eyes tight. She shook her head and stepped forward. “I told you what would happen if I saw you here again. My hands are tied Mister Malfoy.”Astoria stepped forward before Minerva could fully turn her back. “Please...Professor...you know who we are. We never chose this for ourselves.” Astoria said with intent.Minerva would not make eye contact with either of them before fully turning her back. “I give you one hour Mister Malfoy.”Astoria felt her heart plummet. An hour for what? To escape? Where would they be able to go in an hour?“We need to go. We must get you out of here before she summons the Ministry. We—we—” Astoria said beginning to stutter and dart for the grand staircase.Draco grabbed hold of her hand and pulled her into his embrace. “You need to get out of here.”Astoria gazed up at him and lost control of her crying. Why was he saying this? None of this was real, it was not happening. How was life ripping them apart, again?“NO! I will not leave you. I will stand by your side!”Draco cradled her face and placed a passionate kiss upon her lips. He granted her a small smile and caressed her face with his thumb.“I love you with all I am.” He whispered against her lips. She could feel the tears falling from his eyes hitting her cheeks.“I—I---love you endlessly.” She croaked out while connecting their lips once more.Draco gazed into her eyes as if he was taking her image in for the last time. To see her now, standing before him, heartbroken, but free.Draco inhaled greatly. “WINKY!”
  POP
Seconds later the tiny house elf Winky appeared before them. “Draco called for Winky?”Draco nodded and took entwined his wife’s hand. “I need you to deliver my wife to the house of Andromeda Tonks.”Winky nodded greatly and proceeded to extend her hand to Astoria. “Winky will make sure Tori arrives safely.”Astoria looked down at the tiny elf, and then back at her husband. How could she leave him to fend for himself against the Ministry? How was she going to break him out of this one? It seemed nearly impossible.Draco pulled her in for one last tight embrace, and he raked his hands through her long hair. He knelt before her to plant a kiss on her belly, and finally one last kiss on her lips.Draco referred his gaze to notice, one hour was nearly upon him. “Go now.” He said while pushing her toward Winky.Astoria connected her hand with Winky’s, and Draco turned his back to face the great doors of the castle. Astoria felt her heart strings popping one by one. How many times can a heart break before its impossible to fix?Astoria clutched onto her necklace, until she suddenly saw through Draco’s eyes. His eyesight was blurry due to the tears in his eyes. She squinted to break the contact and followed Winky up the Great Hall stairs.“I cannot leave yet. I need a moment.” Astoria whispered.Astoria and Winky remained hidden at the top of the staircase, and she knew Draco had the inkling that she had never yet left him.Moments later, Auror’s filled the space and began to yell from all angles.Draco tried to fend off the Auror’s by casting curses, and hex’s there way, but there was too many of them. Finally, one Auror, casted a curse that immobilized Draco and kept him frozen in place.“Draco Lucius Malfoy for the murder of Albus Dumbledore, intent of harming an Auror, and being a known Death Eater, I hereby arrest you in the name of Kingsley Shacklebolt, our Minister of Magic.” An Auror spat in his face.Astoria felt her knuckles begin to whiten and her eyes shut so tight. She watched the only man she ever loved being captured by the Ministry, and she remained powerless. If she, had it her way, she would gladly stand trial by his side. Like a true partner.“Ready Miss Tori?” Winky asked hesitantly.Astoria took Winky’s hand lightly and within seconds they vanished from the castle.
  CRACK
Astoria felt her body shift into the new space and as she opened her eyes, she saw Andromeda run from the inside of her house. Astoria fell to the floor and cried out into the sky as Andromeda held her tight.“They took him! I lost him! I---I---oh my Gods he is GONE!” Astoria cried out harshly.Andromeda clutched onto her tightly and allowed her to cry out as much as she liked.“Shhh---Shhh calm down Astoria...please...” Andromeda pleaded.Astoria could not help herself. All the sadness, anger, hurt she pent up was finally being released in this moment. She knew she needed to develop a plan to help Draco escape, but she needed to know what the Ministry was planning on doing with him.Hopefully, the Ministry would allow Draco to a fair trial, and Astoria was determined to attend. No matter the cost, she was not going to allow her husband to do this alone. She was with him, for better or worse.

  2005
The winter air was growing more apparent with the new year in full swing. Astoria could feel how frozen she felt. Nothing felt worth living for anymore, even with her child growing stronger as the days went on.The news came not as a shock, because she had not heard from her best friend in many years, however reading it in print made it real. Even after all this time, Astoria held out hope that one day, she would see Lilla again. For it was not possible anymore to see somebody who no longer walks amongst the living.Astoria’s eyes read the Daily Prophet’s front page so many times she felt her eyes permanently burned on the parchment.Astoria crumbled the picture blasted on the front page and made a large crease down Dolohov’s smirking face. The article read...
   

  DUBOIS HEIRESS FOUND DEAD & DEATH EATER TRIALS TO COMMENCE
          The Ministry of Magic is pleased to announce that its search for the whereabouts of Death Eaters is proven victorious, for now. Even though He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has been “silent” for over a year, the Ministry is fully dedicated to bringing You-Know-Who’s followers to justice! The trial of Antonin Dolohov and Theodore Nott Sr. is to be held tomorrow at 3:00 o’clock pm! Dolohov is to be tried on several counts, for being a known Death Eater and for the accused murder of his wife, Lilliana Dubois Dolohov.Dubois was said to be allegedly betrothed to Dolohov at the tender age of sixteen. Whether the wedding occurred before she was eighteen is unknown, but the Ministry can confirm the couple was wed before she was twenty-years old. Dubois’ body was examined by Ministry acclaimed Healer’s and it has been confirmed that before her untimely death, she birthed a child. The whereabouts of the child are unknown. Auror’s raided the Dolohov Manor to collect Antonin and his colleague Nott Sr. The Auror’s were surprised of what they found in the dungeons of the Manor. Dubois’ body laid cold for many months before she was removed from the scene, but it appeared a conservational charm was placed to preserve her from decomposing. The exact time frame of Dubois’ death is still unknown, reasons also unknown to the public.Dolohov nor confirms or denies the murder of his wife, he decided to plead with the Silencio and await trial. How could Astoria believe a word that was written on the parchment? She felt the picture that was printed on the front of Antonin smirking was directed towards her. To laugh in her face that her eldest friend was murdered, and it was Astoria’s fault for not rescuing her.Astoria rose from her chair and set the dreaded Prophet ablaze. How could she let this happen to Lilla? Why was she not there to protect her?It was all her fault.Andromeda knocked at the door slowly before Astoria allowed her to enter. Astoria felt larger than she ever had in her life. Her stomach protruded more than she ever realized it could, her feet the size of the footballs, and all she could think about was swallowing a plate of Pumpkin Pasties.“Tori...I think you should read this.” Andromeda said while clutching yet another copy of the Daily Prophet in her hands.“Not again. I cannot bare it.” Astoria pleaded.Andromeda stepped forward and bestowed the front page of the Prophet. It was what she expected. The man she loved more than life itself was photographed on the front page. The world now knew of his capture.
  DUMBLEDORE’S ASSASIN CAPTURED
Draco Malfoy (age 25) was spotted in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on a snowy New Years Eve night. Headmistress Minerva McGonagall informed the Ministry that Malfoy had been skulking around the castle with none other than Astoria Greengrass, now formally Malfoy. However, Greengrass was able to flee Hogwarts before the Auror’s arrived to collect Malfoy to take him into custody. Reasons on why the Malfoy’s were in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are currently unknown, but the Ministry has summed it up as to do bidding for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!The charges for Draco Malfoy are as followed, assassination of Albus Dumbledore (June 7, 1997), being a known Death Eater, and for the attempt of harm against an Auror. The trial of Draco Malfoy will commence in one weeks’ time! Astoria read the article at least three times before the words finally sunk in. Too much was happening too fast for her to function properly. In her condition, she should not be dealing with such high intensity stress. Magical pregnancies are already high risk for first time pregnancies.Astoria did not even blink when she made the decision she did.“I am going to that trial.” She stated bluntly.“Are you bonkers? You cannot go to his trial.” Andromeda said while looking flabbergasted. “You’ll be spotted and captured. Then what? Have a matching cell with Draco while I raise your child? I won’t have it!” Andromeda yelled trying to knock sense into Astoria.Astoria knew that everyone around her was going to have negative opinions about her decision to attend her husbands trail, but what type of wife would she be if she was not there to support her partner?“The moment somebody recognizes you, they will take you into custody. The Wizarding World knows your Draco’s wife, they are expecting you to make an appearance. This says trap all over it!” Andromeda said bluntly.Astoria threw up her hands in attempt to silence Andromeda. “Enough! My mind is made up. Fetch Pansy and Theo for me, would you? It’s imperative I see them.”Astoria sat back in her chair and stared at the Prophet. Yet another article ruined her day, just more parchment to add to the already burning fire. It was not until nightfall when Pansy and Theo arrived at Andromeda’s home. Astoria had a plan, and she knew the couple would have no choice but to go along with it, and it was sure to be a success.“Look I know you are upset about what you saw in the Prophet today, and about Lilla but—” Theo began to say until Astoria shushed him.“Everybody is to listen first, comment after.” She clipped.Pansy furrowed her brows and proceeded to scooch closer to her husband, and they both nodded their heads.Astoria sat tall in her chair and placed one hand on her enlarged belly to regard the couple.“Draco’s trial is in four days, and I will be there. The question of how, is quite simple. Obviously, I cannot walk into the Ministry as myself, I will be captured immediately. However, if I were to arrive as someone else (Astoria’s eyes shifted to Pansy) my presence would be undetected.”Astoria paused for a moment to allow Theo and Pansy to gather their thoughts. After a minute or two, Pansy finally spoke.“Astoria! You cannot Polyjuice yourself as me! Its impossible. You’re—You’re---pregnant! Its dangerous for the child!” Pansy exclaimed frantically.Indeed, it was dangerous for a pregnant witch to intake Polyjuice potion. The damage could be fatal to the fetus. Astoria was due to deliver any day now, and there was no choice, if she was to Polyjuice the baby would be apparent in her desired body. Otherwise known as, there was no hiding the pregnancy.“It’s a chance I am willing to take.” Astoria clipped while keeping her nose further in the air.Theo seemed to be thinking deeply, and was no doubt, trying to outweigh all the options. But it seemed, he could not come up with another solid plan.“Theo... please...” Astoria pleaded.Theo let out a large sigh and pinched his temple, this seemed to upset Pansy greatly.“You cannot seriously be considering going along with her plan! She could harm her child! Draco’s child!” Pansy said while growing louder.“I know you Tori, you are going to do everything in your power to attend that bloody trial. If we go along with this plan, at least I can ensure your safety.” Theo finally said.Astoria felt like an elephant had walked off her chest. If Theo could get on board with her plan, then she knew Pansy would soon follow. In the end, there were no other options.Pansy took a deep breath and focused her gaze on anything but Astoria. Pansy shook her head and began to speak with hints of disappointment.“Fine. If Theo thinks he can keep you safe, then I trust you both.”Astoria mouthed “Thank you” to her friend and Pansy rolled her eyes.“Andromeda has Polyjuice brewed someone in her stash. The day of the trial you both will come here, and the plan will commence. The brew Andromeda keeps will sustain me for roughly five hours. Theo and I will attend the trial and arrive swiftly home. I promise.” Astoria said while bouncing eye-contact between Pansy and Theo.Pansy stepped forward and placed her hand on top of Astoria’s. “If this will bring you peace, then I am by your side. Draco is my best friend, but so are you.”The two women gave a comforting hug and Theo popped a small departing kiss on Astoria’s cheek before the couple disapparated before her. The day of the trial came quicker than the young witch anticipated. She could feel her heart in her throat, and her sweat glands producing more percperation than they ever had from nerves.Astoria was pacing in the formal living room when Andromeda skulked in with her final brew of Polyjuice. The older witch was more or else convinced this was a good idea, but everyone understood why it was so important for Astoria to attend this bloody trial.It was Draco. The man who broke her heart and stitched it back together countless times over. Andromeda gave Astoria a tight embrace and kissed her cheek swiftly. “I will see you for dinner. I am volunteering at St Mungo’s for a few hours today. I should be home before nightfall.”Astoria clutched onto the tiny brew and lifted her hand to touch the jewel of her necklace to see through her husbands’ eyes.When she re-opened her eyes she saw the bars, the darkness, and the cold cement floor of Azkaban Prison. Astoria clicked her eyes shut to cut off the connection, for she could not bare to witness the pain her love was going through.
  POP
“Winky has come to give you this, Miss Tori.” The tiny elf handed Astoria two banana-nut muffins. “One is for Miss. Tori and the other is for Mister Draco.”Astoria wiped off the tears that filled her cheeks and accepted the muffins gladly, but she knew in her heart, that Draco would never be able to enjoy them.“Thank you Winky. Now you head on back to the kitchens. I don’t want the Headmistress to miss you.” Astoria said quietly.
  POP
Winky vanished before her eyes, just to have Theo and Pansy strut through the door, looking more uneasy than ever.“Are you ready?” Theo asked quietly.Astoria nodded and took a deep breath. Pansy added her own hairs to the Polyjuice Potion and took a step back to link her arm with her husbands.Astoria glared down at the disgusting, mud textured potion before her and thought, “I need to do this.” Astoria gulped back the potion and felt her skin beginning to crawl, the bones in her face beginning to shift. Before she knew it, she was on her knees in pain with Andromeda on one arm, and Theo on the other. Astoria opened her eyes to the slightest to witness her long blond hair beginning to shorten and turn black. Her fingernails began to grow in length, as did her height.After what felt like hours, the Polyjuice transformation was complete. She opened her eyes and peered around. Nothing looked different, nor she did she feel much different. Astoria hastened to the nearest mirror and a woman who was different from her stared back, minus one downfall. Astoria turned to the side to see her pregnant belly remained apparent, but her face was viewed as Pansy Parkinson.Theo glared into her eyes, and then back at his wives.“This is creepy.” Theo admitted.“This is creepy for you? What about me? I am seeing myself right now.” Pansy spat.Astoria rolled her eyes and proceeded to pull the cloak around her body and pin the remains of her newly black hair into a bun, while placing a large black rounded hat on her head. Theo clasped his own cloak and placed a hat over his head.Astoria strode over to Theo and Pansy to discuss another important matter with them, perhaps more important than the entire mission.“Pansy, Theo. You two are like family to Draco and I, and I need to bother you with yet another request...” Astoria said breathlessly.Pansy placed her hand on Astoria’s shoulder and attempted to crack a smile. “What could that be?”Astoria paused for a moment and placed Pansy’s and Theo’s hand on her enlarged pregnant belly. Within a few moments the couple’s gaze shifted.“If something happens to Draco or me, will you do us the honor of taking in our child? Protect it at every cost...” Astoria croaked.Theo was left speechless when Pansy embraced Astoria swiftly while nodding her head, followed a few escaped tears.“Of course, we would.” Pansy said. “But it will not come to that. You are its mother, and Draco is its father. It deserves to be with you BOTH.”Astoria (transformed as Pansy) linked arms with Theo and proceeded to exit Andromeda’s house. Astoria shot Pansy and Andromeda one last look before they apparated to the guest entrance to the Ministry in London.“Come on. The trial is going to begin in thirty.”Astoria pushed herself into the tiny muggle red box, and waited for something to happen, until the box itself began to sink.Suddenly, the room was filled with people. So many pushing and shoving towards the front. Astoria glared out of the box and saw the Daily Prophet headlines, “DRACO MALFOY STANDS TRIAL.” Her heart felt as if it was going to be ripped from her chest.Theo guided Astoria through the crowds, and so far, nobody was bothering them. They were receiving looks, but they were normal social cued glares.The entrance to the courtroom was before her and she felt her feet freeze in place. Astoria’s breath began to hasten, and her chest heave. The anxiety was building too fast, and too greatly. What if Draco is sent back to Azkaban? What if he is sentenced to a Dementor’s Kiss? What if...What if...Astoria faltered in her stance before Theo held her in place and gave her a quick squeeze. “You can do this.”“I can’t.... What was I thinking? Am I mad? I cannot be here to witness this...I can’t...I can’t...” Tears streamed from her eyes and Theo pulled her into his chest to cry as hard as she needed too.“Draco needs us now, come on.” Theo said sternly.Theo and Astoria planted a seat on the side of the courtroom, and they watched the members of the Wizengamot file in, one by one.Theo began to bounce his feet and twiddle his fingers. His agitated state became more apparent the closer the trial came to starting.Theo nudged Astoria’s arm as his eyes pointed to a familiar face in the Wizengamot. Hermione Granger was a member of the Magical Parliament, which came to no surprise. The witch was always ambitious, her nose was constantly in her bloody books.Astoria felt stunned that she was seeing Granger again, after all these years. Could this be Draco’s ticket out of Azkaban? Surely, if Granger still feels the same towards Draco, then she should have no problem convincing the council to vote for his freedom.Kingsley Shacklebolt, the current Minister of Magic was beginning to enter the courtroom.“I require silence at all times during this trial. If there is any commotion of any kind, the agitator will be escorted out.” Kingsley said boldly while beginning to flip through the many scrolls on his podium. “Bring forth the accused.”Astoria felt her body shift as she was about to see her husband in his lowest state. The cage from the ground began to rise. For she saw the man she loved in the worst state of his life.Draco’s head was lowered, and he refused to make eye contact with anybody. Theo grabbed Astoria’s hand and held it tightly for support.“Draco Lucius Malfoy you are charged with murder, attempt of murder and being a known Death Eater. How do you plea?”Draco said nothing. Not a word. Astoria needed him to say something, anything. Something to show he deserved his freedom.“Mister Malfoy if you do not state how, you plea, it is this courts greatest regret that we find you....”“It does not matter how I plea. You all have made up your minds.” Draco spat while keeping his head low.Kingsley furrowed his brows and shifted in his seat looking irritated. The members of the Wizengamot began to talk amongst themselves, but for some reason every time Astoria shifted her eyes back at Granger, she found her looking back.“We may have our own opinions, Mister Malfoy, but people who are biased have no place in my court. Now, lets proceed.” Kingsley unraveled the first scroll. “On June 30, 1997, you assassinated your late headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Are these charges true?”Draco turned his head and lowered it more but gave a small nod. Astoria desperately needed him to explain how Voldemort made him do this, how he was a victim in this war.Kingsley was about to shift to the next scroll of charges when a member of the council rose her hand.“Minister, if I may. Mister Malfoy I had heard from several inside sources about how You-Know-Who is manipulative and will threaten the people you love to get what he wants. Is this true?” Hermione questioned while Draco nodded softly again. Astoria could sense when he heard Granger’s voice his head perked up, and he met Hermione’s eyes. “Then tell me. Why did you murder Albus Dumbledore?”Draco lifted his head and folded his arms. “To save the woman I love.”Kingsley eyes grew and his expression changed slightly. The Minister glared at Hermione, and she sat at once.Astoria felt a single hot tear stream down her cheek and how desperately she wanted Draco to turn his head and look at her. Draco assassinated Dumbledore to save her, it was always for her. Another member of the Wizengamot stood abruptly to ask Draco a follow up question. It was Ernie Macmillan who was a former student at Hogwarts with Draco.“Are you talking about the Dark Lord’s pet? Astoria Greengrass?”Draco rose to his feet and shook the bars loudly causing everyone to gasp. “NEVER call her that.”Astoria placed a hand on her belly and could feel the baby inside doing somersaults. The baby was as anxious as she was to hear Draco’s voice.“Mister Malfoy did you receive the Dark Mark at age sixteen?” Kingsley questioned.Draco suddenly rolled his sleeve to reveal the skulled lock and key of the Dark Mark. It caused the room to gasp once more. Witches were so flabbergasted their hands were over their mouths, wizards were shaking their heads.“That answers my question then—”Draco began to lean against the bars once more until yet again, Hermione Granger stood up to speak.“Why did you receive the Mark, Mister Malfoy?” Granger said loudly.Draco crossed his arms and shook his head. “She basically gave it to me.”Astoria knew he was talking about her; she would never forget that awful night. In this moment it felt like a hundred years ago.“Do explain, Malfoy.” Kingsley spat.Draco huffed when he suddenly turned his head. His eyes grew large, and his expression shifted. Astoria’s eyes met his, but it was not her eyes he was meeting but the eyes of Pansy Parkinson. But she knew in her heart, Draco knew it was his wife sitting there. Draco stood tall and shifted to the middle of the cage.“My wife, Astoria, was forced to receive a Runic Imprint from the Dark Lord at a young age. The magic of the imprint is binding for the victim. I defied the Dark Lord, and his punishment was to punish me with an imprint as he did to my wife. Astoria pleaded for me to receive the Mark in place of the Rune.”Kinglsey shifted forward looking intrigued. “Correct me if I am wrong, but this Imprint you speak of, does it contain Eldritch Magic?”Draco nodded swiftly and Kingsley huffed, it appeared the Minister knew the dangers of what Greek Eldritch Magic can do.The entire courtroom went silent. No one could form a thought it seemed. Astoria’s eyes shifted to the Minister who’s eyes were scanning the scrolls.“Thank you for your candor. The last charge is the most recent. Attempt of harming an Auror. When you were captured, you were found in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You casted an unforgiveable at an Auror, and he nearly collapsed. How do you plea?”Draco smirked and cocked his head. “Guilty but with good reason.”Kingsley leaned forward and clasped his hands.“Elaborate.”“I was in Hogwarts for Astoria’s protection. The Dark Lord is after something we love. We sought out sanctuary behind the walls of the castle. Minerva warned me if I ever returned, she would turn me in, but I did not heed her warning.” He paused and took a breath. “How could I? When the woman I love was in danger? When the Auror’s arrived, I sent my wife away and stood my ground until she escaped.”Astoria eyes shifted at her husbands, and they kept their gaze long enough for her to mouth, “I love you” to him. He nodded his head and snapped his eyes back to the Minister. For it was time for the Wizengamot to vote on a verdict.A young lady stood up in the council. “Mister Malfoy we hear your testimonies, and some may even sympathize with you, but the charges are as stated. Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges...” Almost half of the Wizengamot raised their hands, including Granger. “Those in favor of contempt.” Much of the council rose their hands, including Kingsley.Astoria’s heart crumbled and she let out a cry that caused several heads to turn toward her. She tried to lower her head beneath her hat, but her heart was breaking too loudly to shield.Kingsley stood and clasped his hands in front. “Draco Lucius Malfoy for the murder of Albus Dumbledore, the act of being a Death Eater, and attempt of harm to an Auror, you are found guilty by the votes of the Wizengamot. Your punishment for your crimes includes being kissed by a Dementor until your soul leaves your body.”Astoria let out a scream, and the crowd went into an uproar. Some were cheering, some were screaming with sadness. The cage was beginning to lower when Astoria jumped over the ledge and held onto the bars while Draco attempted to touch her one last time.“Don’t leave me!” Astoria begged before the cage vanished.Theo pulled her away from the cage and attempted to guide her out. “We need to get out of here!”Astoria began to walk out of the courtroom when she felt a piercing pain hit her body. Her abdomen felt as if it was being ripped in two and the baby felt as if it was bursting between her legs. Astoria grabbed onto her stomach and let out a cry.“Ohh---Gods! Aghhhh!”“What is it? What’s wrong!” Theo demanded while holding onto her arm as she was hunched over.“Aghhh fucking Merlin.” Astoria said while trying to lift her head.Astoria needed to get out of here. She began to run from Theo and run towards the nearest Floo. Astoria’s hair began to grow long and blond, her height shrunk. People around her were bumping into her as the Polyjuice began to ware off.She had to stop several times to hunch over and try to ride out the pain she was feeling. All she could see were the green flames of the Floo fireplaces. She needed to get there...quickly...“Who is that? What’s wrong Miss?” One witch said as she shoved past her.Astoria’s hat fell from her head and the Polyjuice officially wore off. She was no longer Pansy Parkinson.“Aghhhh!” She screamed.“I think that’s HER!” A few wizards screamed and pointed.“That has to be HER! The wife!” One witch screamed. “The Dark Lord’s pet!”Astoria fell to her knees in pain as she felt someone yank on her arm to pull her to her feet.“Come on ya’ little troublemaker.” Theo spat while rushing her to her swollen feet.The pair rushed to the nearest Floo until they were suddenly covered in green flames, and the Ministry was gone. Theo and Astoria slid through a fireplace that seemed to be in a book shop.Theo hoisted Astoria up and guided her outside. They were still in London. The pain inside her body was nothing she had ever felt before, she would have rather taken the Cruciatus curse.“Theo....I think....” Astoria began to say before she felt the rush of liquid slide out of her.“Just a little further.” Theo reassured ignoring the liquid trail she left.Astoria glared up at a broken-down building that had broken windows, mattered bricks, and a mannequin in the front. Where was she exactly?“My friend is having a baby.” Theo said promptly to the mannequin who nodded.Theo guided Astoria through the entrance and when she re-opened her eyes she saw the white walls, the clean floors, and the name of the establishment: “St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.”When Astoria arrived inside, she pushed Theo from her grasp and pulled him in closely. “Get back to the Ministry. Find Hermione Granger, save him Theo!”Theo nodded promptly before fleeing the scene leaving Astoria alone to fend for herself.

  2005
Draco relished in the memory of when his fingers brushed with hers for a second before his cage descended into the ground. He knew behind the magic of the potion lived his wife, Astoria.She never should have attended his trial, he never wanted her too. Why didn’t Andromeda or Pansy forbid her from stepping within the Ministry? Astoria was already in enough danger with the Dark Lord after their unborn child.Soon, his soul would be forcibly removed by the crushing kiss of a dementor. It was written in his Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook that a Dementor’s Kiss is a fate worse than death. If that was true, then Draco hoped for death.But if he died then he would leave behind everyone he loved, his wife, his friends, even his unforgiveable mother.The Wizengamot tried against him, which was no surprise, given his records. He wished he would have spoken more passionately for his life, but maybe his passion was washed away. How can anyone develop hope behind the walls of a cell?Even with Granger’s testimonies it was no use. Draco knew how she felt about him, and how she was trying to use every trick in the book to try and convince the council to set him free. Even after all this time, Granger fought for him, but it wasn’t enough. Nothing was ever enough anymore.**Hermione sprinted to the exit of the courtroom when she heard people screaming from within the entrance of the Ministry. It appeared that her hunch was correct, Astoria snuck into the Ministry to witness Draco’s trial.Just before Hermione could catch up to her, Astoria and Theo jumped into the Floo and vanished. She hastened up to her office as quick as she could to gather her thoughts.One thing was for certain, she was not going to let the Dementor’s suck out Draco’s soul, even if it was already damned.She needed a plan to help him escape, and quick. How could she sneak Draco out of the dungeons without anyone noticing?Hermione lifted her wand to conjure a Patronus message to her husband, George Weasley. “Get to my office, it is an emergency.” Her glowing otter flitted out her window and she could do nothing but sit, worry, and wait. The plan she was developing in her head was mad, but fool-proof.After what seemed like hours, her red-haired husband burst into her office with his magenta suit jacket and worried expression.“’Mione? What is it? What’s happened?” George said while placing his hands firmly on her shoulders.How was Hermione to phrase this carefully to her husband? There was no correct way that she needed his help to save her first love from a murderous kiss.“If I needed something from you, would you give it to me without question?”George furrowed his brows and shook his head in disbelief. “Wha—what’d you mean?”Hermione glared down at her feet and took a deep breath.“I need strands of your hair for Polyjuice potion.”George took a step back and was about to say something but then glared down at the trial scrolls on her desk. He grabbed onto Draco’s scroll and crumbled it.“I thought we were past this, Hermione!”“We—I—am! I—” She stuttered.“Obviously not! You want MY help to break out Malfoy, don’t’ya?” George said angrily, and when Hermione refused to answer he shook her at her shoulders. “DON’T YOU?”Hermione nodded her head and broke free. “YES! I love him! I have always loved him!”George paced around the office and pinched his temple. “I can’t even look at you right now. My own wife, in love with another man, who is responsible for BOTH my brothers’ deaths!” George bellowed while backing Hermione up into a corner. “Do you realize his wife is the one who KILLED RON? Or have you forgotten that?”Hermione shook her head and reached for her wand in her back pocket. She glanced over at the clock and noticed she was wasting too much time.“I am sorry.” She whispered. “Stupefy!” George’s body hit the ground like a sack of bricks.Hermione bent over him and took strands of his hair and placed them promptly within a handkerchief. She kissed his forehead and apologized once more.Hermione clasped her cloak around her neck and needed to get down to the department of Magical Law Enforcement. In a certain area in the offices, they keep Polyjuice Potion in stock in case any Auror’s need to be undercover. Hermione attempted to keep her head low and avoided eye-contact to avoid social engagement. When she arrived in the department, she was greeted by the witch who tended the front desk.“Hello Aubrey. I need some Polyjuice Potion for Jeremiah upstairs. Can you believe he sent me down here like his errand boy?” Hermione said lightly while trying to keep her cool.“Of course. One moment Mrs. Weasley. Did Mister Peterson say any particular time frame?” Aubrey said.Hermione glared at the clock. “Oh—I would say two hours is sufficient! Thank you.”Aubrey left Hermione’s presence and all she could think about was how she was going to make it down into the dungeons without suspicion. Surely, that place does not have a ditzy front desk lady.What sort of excuse could Hermione come up with for the guards to let her see Draco?Aubrey came back swiftly with the Polyjuice, and Hermione thanked her kindly. She strolled down to the dungeons trying to act as casual as she could, but how casual did it look for her to be traveling to the cells?She noticed the guard at the entrance to the dungeons and had to pull out her superb acting skills, which in the past, were atrocious. In her sixth year she could not even convince Borgin why she was inquiring about a necklace in his shop before she was thrown out.“Mrs. Weasley fancy seeing you down here. What brings ya’?” The broad guard asked in a husky voice.Hermione shoved her hands in her pockets. “I am here for..erm—to acquire the last words for cellmate Malfoy.”She did not sound very convincing to herself, but it was the best she could do with how many nerves shooting through her body.The guard nodded his jarhead and flicked his wand to allow Hermione through graciously.The dungeons looked as bad as to be expected. Cold, stuffy air quality, the sounds of tiny creatures crawling on the ground.Hermione tip-toed through the cells, she passed a few Death Eaters cells who were tried the day before. Such as, Theodore Nott Senior and Antonin Dolohov. Both Death Eaters received Dementor Kisses and were awaiting their return to Azkaban. Their bodies sat on the floor but there was no sign of life in their faces no more. Hermione felt a twinge in her body at the thought of having to watch Draco’s soul be reaped from his body.As Hermione’s heals clicked through the hard floor, she heard someone grab onto the bars at the very last cell.“Let me out, ya’ bastards!” Draco bellowed.Hermione crept up to his cell slowly and took a deep breath. The man she saw in the cage merely an hour prior was no longer there. The man she was seeing right now was a man who remembered he had something to fight for.“Granger?” He said quietly.Hermione held her hand to her mouth in a “shhh” position and put both her hands on the bars.“I am taking you out of here.” Hermione whispered as she reached into her pocket to pull out the Polyjuice potion. “This is the only way how.”Draco backed up away from her and began to pace in his tiny cell. “Granger, Astoria...she—she was at the trial. I need to get to her.”Hermione held her breath and pushed the vial towards him once more. “Drink this and we will walk out together.”Draco walked slowly toward her and went to grab the vial, but Hermione pulled it back. “There is a price for my kindness.” She said mockingly.After all these years, Hermione was the person bailing everyone around her out of their problems. Often time there was no reward for her, this time is different. Her life is also on the line if she gets caught. The penalty for breaking out a convicted felon was a life-sentence in Azkaban.“What is it you want?”Hermione smirked and bit her bottom lip. “You, of course.” She inched closer and held onto the bars with a firm grip. “If I break you out, you’re mine.”Draco huffed and punched the wall, but it appeared to be charmed so no harm could come to the inmates. “You’re SICK!” He said in a hushed but bellowed voice. “I have a WIFE and you have a HUSBAND!”Draco charged toward her and grabbed hold of her left hand exposing her dreaded wedding bands. Hermione’s personal handcuff to someone she never truly loved.“You see these? You belong to Weasley now.” Draco clipped.Hermione scoffed and once again held out the potion. “Well, if you take this, then I am yours.”Draco pinched his temple and took a deep inhale. Maybe Hermione was wrong in thinking that Draco wanted to be broken out. Perhaps he had given up on his life after all and was ready for it all to end. She was tired of trying to fight for his life when he did not want too. Draco Malfoy was either leaving by Hermione’s side after this or was not leaving at all. The choice was his.Hermione folded her arms and kept her smirk.“Choose.” She said.Hermione saw tears stream from his eyes, but she knew in her heart that Draco belonged to her, and that she was his true love. Even after all this time apart, they were meant for one another. She could feel it in her bones.Draco charged toward her and hesitated to grab the vial from her hand, but finally decided to take it.In one gulp Draco downed the potion and doubled over himself from the shock of the intense transformation. His hair became bright red, he grew another five inches, and his silver eyes became brown.“Now get me the fuck out of here, Granger.” He spat.Hermione flicked her wand and the cell door opened immediately. She held out her hand for him to hold, but he sped past her in anger.The guard attempted to stop them at the entrance, but Hermione shot him a quick stunner and his jarhead hit the floor quick.**Draco needed to do everything in his power to escape his incarceration, even if that meant being Polyjuiced as a Weasley. It never occurred to him just how unhinged Granger had become after the battle of Hogwarts. Even after all these years she was pining for him, but this time, she was blackmailing him.The only important factor in this moment was getting home so he could fetch Astoria and flee the country. After the Ministry gets wind of Malfoy’s escape, there is a good chance Draco could never return to Britain.“Where would you like to go once, we get out of here?”Draco shook his head and hummed but did not answer her, until she repeated her question, this time with an irritated tone.“I don’t know. You pick, I suppose.” Draco said while trying to act like a Weasley.There were people all around them, mindless conversations happening. Some involving Draco’s trial, but most involved what those people were planning on having for supper when they got home.The sweat was beginning to form, and the anxiety growing as the lift gates opened to expose the atrium of the Ministry.Draco peered out and noticed a figure running through the crowd with great haste. As the figure grew larger, it appeared to be Theo.“Excuse me! Where can I find Hermione Granger err—Weasley’s office? It is urgent!” Theo said to a random Ministry employee.“We need to avoid him.” Hermione said under her breath as she tugged Draco the other direction.But as the couple was beginning to make haste in the other direction Arthur Weasley was traveling up the lift and made eye contact with Draco (as George Weasley).“’Ello George! Come to fetch Hermione from work? How are you m’dear?” Arthur said while tapping Draco’s shoulder and placing a soft kiss on Hermione’s cheek.“Erm—ahh—Arthur! What a pleasant surprise to find you here on this floor. Anything wrong?” Hermione said.“Not at all. Just came up here to fetch myself a copy of the Evening Prophet.”As the air grew more tense the clock kept ticking. Draco had merely thirty minutes left to flee the Ministry as George, but more obstacles seemed to step in their way.“Well, I must be off! I shall see you both this Sunday for dinner.” Arthur said as he passed by them.Hermione tugged on Draco’s hand, and she could feel his wedding band that hugged his ring finger. She stopped in her tracks and held up his hand forcefully.“This can come off now.” She said while attempting to yank the band off his finger, but he stopped her.“No.” He clipped. “It is all I have left of her.”Draco quickly held his finger to his band and attempted to see through his wife’s eyes, but all he could see a blinding light. A blinding light that followed with loads of people standing around her. Suddenly, the contact was broken when Hermione seized his hand.“Astoria is gone, Draco.” She spat.“What are you talking about?” He said forcibly while seizing her shoulders.“That whore was spotted in the atrium collapsed over herself, that is until Theo pulled her up and she escaped through the Floo.” Hermione said with a smirk.The blinding light, and all the people he saw through Astoria’s eyes. She was in trouble, something had to of been wrong.Draco tossed over Hermione causing her to collapse to the floor. Running through the hallways like a mad man, he needed to find Theo.“NOTT!” He called out countless times.Theo finally made himself known when he peered around a corner.“Weasley? Is it?” Theo said hesitantly.“Nott, shut it you prat. Its me, now tell me—”“Malfoy!!” Theo said a little too loudly.Draco put his hand over Theo’s mouth and nodded slowly.“Mate, its Astoria. I think she went into labor.”Draco had no time to think, he needed to find his wife, while he was still able to walk around as a “free” man.As he was walking in a fast pace his hand was yanked back forcibly and his lips were connected with another’s.“Hello, darling. Is there something you have forgotten?” Hermione said mockingly.Theo shot a look at Draco and shook his head. Nothing in this moment was going right. At any moment Hermione could blow Draco’s cover, and he would be hauled back to his holding cell awaiting to receive a kiss from a Dementor.“What the bloody hell do you think you are doing?” Theo said boldly while coming in between Draco and Hermione.“Excuse me?” She said while getting an inch from Theo’s face. “I am the one who saved Draco, not you. Now, he is mine. That blond bitch has had him for years and look where he ended up.” Hermione whispered.“Enough of this.” Draco said firmly, following up with a question of Astoria’s whereabouts. The trio fled into the nearest Floo and Draco could feel the Polyjuice beginning to wear-off. His blond hair was returning, along with his pale complexion.Draco (as himself) stepped through the Floo of a library in downtown London. Theo and Hermione shortly followed.Yanking Hermione by the hand and leading her into a dark area of the library, was the perfect time to end all of this, for good.“It is time for you to listen and listen well. I do not love you, and I have not loved you for many years. Whatever you have in your mind about us, is finished. I will forever be grateful for your recent sacrifices, but what you ask, is too much.” Draco said faintly.Hermione remained silent, for only her breaths could be heard. Until finally she rose her head and spoke. “You are my soulmate, Draco.” She said while taking off her wedding bands. “See but the thing is, I can’t let you go. If I cannot have you...” She said while inching closer. “No one can.” Hermione drew her wand rapidly and as she was about to mutter an unforgiveable curse Theo dove in and hit her with a stunner.Hermione’s body hit the floor, where she would lay unconscious.“Send a Patronus to her damned husband. Tell him to fetch her.” Draco spat to Theo.As Draco stared down at an unconscious Hermione, he felt himself feel for her, but not in the way he used too. Hermione became so consumed with obsessive love that it took over her rational thinking. That young woman would never be able to feel the touch of a man who she truly loved because her mind would be eternally focused on Draco.Suddenly, a burning sensation began on Draco’s left forearm where his Dark Mark laid. That could mean one of two things, the Dark Lord was summoning the Death Eaters, or the Dark Lord was close in proximity.Theo glared up at Draco and gave him a chilling look, he knew what his facial expression meant, and it was not good.“Astoria.” Draco said quietly.**Astoria clung onto the walls of the Hospital. The pain inside her body was growing more intense as the minutes passed. She was finally able to Apparate herself up to the Maternity Ward where she was instantly surrounded by Healer Assistant’s.“Hhh-ee—llpp me please!”A Healer Assistant levitated her instantly onto a gurney and she put her hand on her shoulder. “Okay, alright honey, tell me your name.” The Healer Assistant said in a quiet, comforting voice.“I am---I am---” Astoria began to say until a friendly hand touched hers.“Astoria! My goodness!”  Andromeda said shockingly. “Merlin, you are bleeding. We need to stop the bleeding! Roll her into I.C.U.!”Astoria could not make out where she was going, and all she could see when she opened her eyes was white walls, and blinding lights. The creature inside of her was strong, and it felt as if it was clawing itself out of Astoria’s body.All she wanted was Draco to be there by her side, holding her hand, telling her everything was going to be fine, but it did not feel like it would be.Astoria felt her body hit the surface of a bed while her feet got propped, and her back was sat up. There was too much to focus on, and she could not focus her attention on anything but her doomed husband. Even if she felt her inside tearing apart, vein by vein.Astoria felt drops of sweat leave her forehead, and her hands begin to moisten. The world around her looked gray, but the bright lights made her skin feel as if she were on fire. Healers surrounded her, and she felt her body being prodded by unknown hands.“She’s losing a lot of blood. We need to keep her stable.” The Head Healer said while trying to control the bleeding between her legs.Andromeda cradled Astoria’s hand and she kissed her forehead. “Come on sweetheart, stay strong.”Astoria felt strong enough to raise her head and speak dryly. “Where...where is he? Tell me....”Andromeda bowed her head and furrowed her brows. She shook her head and felt herself cry harder. Where was Draco? He was needed here; he needs to be here... with Astoria...his wife.“Alright honey, I am going to need you to push.” Said the Healer.Astoria shook her head and cried. She was not strong enough to push a full ass human being from her body, she barely had the strength to lift her head.“Astoria, PUSH!” Andromeda said forcefully.Astoria gritted her teeth and pushed with all her might, letting out an intense cry. This child could not be born right now, there was no one to protect it. Who knew how long it might once it is born for her Master to come and collect it? Astoria could not give up her child, it was all she had left her husband.“NO! It cannot be BORN! Aghhh--!” Astoria cried out.The Healer’s all shared confused looks but proceeded to guide the baby out from inside.Astoria felt the urge inside her body to keep pushing until the child was out completely. She pushed with all her might, but her head became fogged. Astoria laid back flat and tilted her head to the dark corner of the room. Astoria was not sure if she was dying, or was hallucinating, but what did it matter in this moment?“Come on Tori, push out the little bastard.” Lilla said while crouching down beside Astoria.“Lill—Lilla...” Astoria said in a whisper.A healer began to bare down and push on Astoria’s stomach, causing the baby to begin to slide out.“You are going to love that child with all you have, and I am going to watch you do it.” Lilla whispered.“Draaccooo.... he...he is...” Astoria croaked.“Don’t worry. We’ll both watch over.” Lilla said faintly.A fierce burning pain erupted inside Astoria and now it felt as if her entire bottom half of her was being ripped from end to end.“Just a little more Astoria!” Andromeda said.“Fucking Merlin!” Astoria bellowed.A faint baby cry started, and the entire room sat in silence. It was done, the baby was born.“It’s a girl.” The Healer said while placing the infant in Astoria’s arms.Astoria looked down at her daughter and let out the faintest laugh, followed by a cry.“Our daughter.” Astoria whispered. She tilted her head to look at Lilla, but she was gone. Was she ever actually there?Suddenly, a black-haired witch burst into the room and ran to Astoria’s side.“Theo sent me a Patronus telling me what was going on! Oh, my goodness!” Pansy exclaimed while staring down at the crying infant.“What’s her name?” Andromeda said while stroking the infants’ cheeks.Astoria stared down at the tiny baby and desperately wanted to name this child with her husband, but she had to come to the realization. That was no longer possible.“Priscilla Lilliana Malfoy.” Astoria announced.Pansy covered her mouth and smiled. “Its gorgeous, and fitting, given the situation. This one is going to need a strong name.” Andromeda and Pansy decided they needed a cup of tea, so they decided to travel down to St Mungo’s café. Astoria laid awake, bandaged in some places, and her bottom half magically stitched from end to end. A healer came to take the baby from Astoria’s arm and put her down for the night. She kissed her little one’s head and proceeded to drift off into a deep sleep.Something awoke her instantly. A touch upon her hand, and the fuzzy sight of blond hair. Could it be Draco?“Hello precious.” Draco appeared to purr.“Dd-Draco?” Astoria croaked out, half asleep.“Where is my baby?” He purred.Astoria opened her eyes to see the black suited façade of Draco. Could it really be him standing here before her? Did that mean Theo succeeded in finding Draco to break him out before he received the Dementor’s Kiss. Perhaps everything was going to turn out fine after all.

  2005
Astoria felt distorted, her eyes almost as fuzzy as her mind. Draco was standing before her, and she could hardly believe her eyes. He made it here, to be with her, to see their child. Everything was going to be perfect. It meant they could be a family and scatter from Britain.“You’re here.” She croaked out with a tear. Astoria sat up and ran her hand along Draco’s jawline. His skin was cold, and something felt different.Draco’s skin must be cold from lying on a dungeon floor for how many days, it is the only explanation.“How are you here? Did Granger get you out?”Draco ran his hand along her cheek and smirked. “Hush now. All questions are to be answered in due time. Now, where is the baby?”“The baby is a she.” Astoria flicked her wand to cast a quick appearing charm and Priscilla’s basinet revealed itself.Inside the tiny basinet laid the tiny human Draco and Astoria created. Priscilla’s chest rose and fell, mind totally unaware of how special she was.“This is Priscilla.” Astoria held the baby in her arms and Draco peered down.“She will be perfect.” He purred.Draco reached to take the child from Astoria’s arms and cradle her. He rose from her bed and began to walk towards the exit.“I think she fancies a walk.” Draco clipped as he began to walk out of the door.“No! Not yet. She’s not supposed to leave my side just yet.” Astoria bellowed out while jumping from her bed.Still not being fully recovered, magical healing does wonders for new mothers. In the muggle world, a woman can spend days recovering from a birth, but in the wizarding world with just a few flicks of the wand the witch is as good as new.“Come now. I am her father; I can take her.”“No, not yet. I cannot walk far distances quite yet. Tomorrow you can—”“NO! It needs to be NOW!” Draco yelled in her face causing Astoria to jump back.“What is wrong with you!” Astoria attempted to reach for Priscilla but Draco shielded the baby. “Give me my baby!”“She is not yours.” Draco clipped.Astoria was about to retort back until she noticed Draco’s hair beginning to shed from the back, and his face starting to deform.“What the—”Draco’s body suddenly transformed into the demon of her dreams, the man who has haunted her entire life. The body of a man, but the face of a snake. The man that has owned over her life since before she was born.“You have done marvelous work, my precious one.”“My Lord.” Astoria croaked out. “Please don’t.” She said with tears streaming down her face.“Shh calm yourself, Astoria. Your sacrifice will grant me further life, which means—” Voldemort strode over to tip up Astoria’s chin. “---I will be here to take care of you, always.”Astoria closed her eyes and took in a deep inhale. She inched closer to Voldemort. “Always?”“Always, Astoria.” Voldemort purred.Astoria reached behind her body to grab for her wand. As Voldemort was walking to Disapparate she pointed her wand at Priscilla and apparated her instantly.“FOOLISH GIRL! Where is the baby!” Voldemort bellowed.Astoria smirked and laughed lowly. “Gone.”Voldemort lunged for his wand shooting an unforgivable curse her way. Astoria counter-cursed and the streamline of magic expelled exuberant colors. Sparks flew from the power of their grips. St Mungo’s was beginning to crumble around them due to the intensity of their magic.This was the battle Astoria waited for all her life. Voldemort was no God, he was only a man, and he could be killed like any other.Astoria re-muttered an unforgivable under her breath, the velocity of her magic was shooting all around her. She peered at the corner of her eye, and noticed a familiar face staring back at her.“Hold your grip, don’t falter. You can do this; you are the one who can end it all.” Lilla said from behind her.Astoria nodded her head and straightened her stance to gain momentum, but Voldemort’s power was stronger, and she felt her magic starting to weaken.“Inch closer but be quick about it!”Astoria cocked her head to notice yet another ghost from her past was there with her, one she never expected to see again.“I can’t Harry!” Astoria bellowed out.Harry Potter rose his ghostly hand along side her wand arm when suddenly it felt lighter than ever, and a brighter spark expelled from the wood of her wand.“What the—”“Light still resides in you, reach in and use it!” Harry said lowly.Astoria nodded and suddenly locked eyes with her Master’s. His face persistent, his stance strong, and his intention dark. One of them was going to die tonight, but the only question was, who?Astoria meant nothing to her Master, no matter what he claimed, she was not his “precious one.” Over the years the Prophet pegged the wrong, “Chosen One.” Voldemort knew Astoria was the only witch strong enough to match his power, which is why he kept her close, so she could be destroyed, at the proper time.But if Voldemort feared her this entire time, perhaps he should not have had her trained in dueling. It appears even Lords can make mistakes.Astoria’s fingers were burning with tenseness as her grip on her wand had to remain locked. Just for a moment, Astoria felt her finger slide from her grip, and a spark from Voldemort’s curse slid into her chest.Astoria’s head flew back, her body hit the ground, when suddenly it all went white.The young witch re-opened her eyes to look down upon her body, for she was no longer in St Mungo’s.“Astoria! Come on you will miss the carriage!”Astoria cocked her head to witness her father signaling for her. His smile as bright as the sun, his clothes as light as air. Where was she right now?She rose her hand to witness the pale blue uniform she once wore for many years at the Beauxbaton Academy. The stockings lined her legs, and her heels clanked along the cobblestone.“Father?” Astoria said lowly.“My little girl! You look wonderful.” Thomas said as he embraced his daughter. “You’re special Astoria. We all know you are going to achieve greatness.”Astoria teared as she felt her father’s touch on her skin, the warmth of his hand, the fuzzy feeling of looking at his smile.Astoria embraced her father once more. “I love you father.”As Astoria’s was embracing her father, a dark voice appeared behind her.“Such a precious girl.” Voldemort clipped.Astoria’s eye’s snapped back to reality where she laid on the ground of St Mungo’s. Her body weak, her magic feeling dim, and her Master standing over her.“Such a pity. I have done everything in my power to show you how powerful you could have been, but you chose a pathetic disappointment of a man, over me. It saddens me greatly, my precious to do this.” Voldemort spat before releasing an “Avada Kedavra!” Astoria shielded herself with her wand, and she stood promptly on her feet, causing Voldemort to falter ever so slightly. The look of courage swiped from his ugly face and terror soared over his red eyes.“I am not your precious one!” She bellowed out. “Avada Kedavra!” The green spark of the killing curse fled out of her wand, and into the chest of her Master.Voldemort gripped onto his chest tightly, attempting to shield the magic within the curse, but being unsuccessful. Lord Voldemort fell to the ground, his wand out of his wand, his corpse on display.Astoria caught her breath and felt a prickly feeling on the back of her neck. She rushed over to a cracked mirror to witness the Runic Imprint that her Master gave her was starting to fade. All that was left was a tiny scar of what once was.Astoria felt her body falter, the excursion of the killing curse was taking a tole on her body, when suddenly all became black, and her limp body hit the ground.**Draco and Theo apparated to the alleyway where St Mungo’s sat hidden, but the air felt stiff. Birds in the sky were circling the building, and the clouds shifted to cover the sky in gray.Mounds of people began to scurry out of the appeared abandon building of the Wizarding Hospital. Heads turned in curiosity, and the looks of distraught on the people’s faces was not a good sign.Draco and Theo pushed their way through the crowds and into St Mungo’s. Once they were beyond the Muggle repelling boundaries the extent of the damage became apparent.The top floors caved in; the walls were beginning to collapse. There was obviously a battle happening somewhere in this hospital.The only important factor was locating Astoria if she was here. Draco noticed Theo looking cautious but right now was not the time for lag. What if Draco was too late and Astoria got captured and their child ripped from her arms? The thoughts were too harsh to think about it.“Well, come on then!” Draco yelled.The hospital was oddly quiet, and still. No dueling could be heard or the pain from spellcasting. Draco would have rather been hearing a struggle, because at least then he could use his hearing to locate Astoria.The maternity ward was the next level up, and the walls were anything but stable. Not even a pixie dare tries to fly in this mess.Draco apparated into the one of the only stable hallways and the rooms he was checking proved uneventful. Draco suddenly felt his Dark Mark beginning to burn which signified the Dark Lord was near, he needed to locate Astoria before Voldemort does. Where the devil was—“OVER HERE, MALFOY!” Theo yelled from down the hall. “SHE’S HERE!”Draco apparated to where Theo’s voice came from and sure enough there was Astoria on the ground in Theo’s arms, limped over. But her body was not the only surprise to see. Lying on the ground near the door was the, already, decaying body of Lord Voldemort.Draco ignored the corpse of Voldemort and rushed to his love’s side. He held onto her hand which was still warm, she was still alive, just passed out.“The little devil did it, didn’t she?” Theo inquired while kicking Voldemort’s dead feet.Draco ran his hand along the jawline of Astoria and kissed her forehead. He could not believe his eyes, Astoria Greengrass, his wife, his light, won the duel against the most powerful dark wizard to live. For a moment he realized who he was holding in his arms, the witch that was prophesized to save the Wizarding World was his wife.“She’s saved us all.” Draco muttered while scooping up his unconscious wife in his arms. He could not have been prouder of Astoria.Suddenly, a white cast came hurdling toward the men. A silvery white flamingo Patronus became apparent and began to speak with Pansy’s voice.“Priscilla is safe, and with Andromeda and me. She’s beautiful...”Draco peered down at his wife who’s beautiful face looked as peaceful as could be. He and Astoria had a little girl, and her name is Priscilla.“Congratulations, mate. Now you have two girls in your life.” Theo said while nudging Draco’s arm.The thought of raising Priscilla was flashing before Draco’s eyes. The thought of her first steps, travelling to Diagon Alley to purchase her first wand or set of robes. The day she walks the same halls her parents did, many years prior. And the day she discovers her first love, a day Draco could wait a long time for but still a viable moment.All of that while having Astoria by his side, peace at last. Perhaps, with the Dark Lord gone all the darkness that surrounded Draco and Astoria’s lives would vanish—“Drop her.” A voice muttered from behind Draco while pointing a wand in his back.Draco stood frozen and made eye-contact with Theo who was peering in from the hallway, slightly hidden.“Granger. How did you find me?”Hermione laughed to herself and circled Draco while keeping her wand aimed.“I knew you would come crawling back to that little whore once you found out where she was.” Hermione stood closer with an erratic look on her face. “Now, I said drop her.”“Don’t do this. Astoria is my wife, and she needs my help—”“I NEED YOU MORE!” Hermione bellowed out in his face. “YOU PROMISED! What about everything I have sacrificed for you, FOR HER? When am I going to get what I deserve?”Draco lowered his head and kept his wife close in his arms, thankfully she was still blissfully unconscious.“This is me breaking that bloody promise!” Draco said while attempting to shove past Hermione, but she struck his face.“I am finished being pushed aside! Imperio!”Draco felt his body begin to set Astoria on the ground, and suddenly he wanted to leave St Mungo’s and runaway with Hermione. Perhaps she was the better option for him, and she loved him more than Astoria did?“CRUCIO!” Theo rushed in wand in hand pointing at Hermione who collapsed onto the floor, thrashing in pain.Draco’s mind became flexible to his own will again, and he was no longer having those thoughts about Hermione. It was astounding the boundaries she is willing to push to get her way.Draco crouched down beside Hermione who was attempting to catch her breath, Theo stood over her ready to cast another unforgiveable if needed.“It was never you it is always going to be Astoria.” Draco spat.“You love me, I know you do.” Hermione croaked out while the tears streamed down her face.“I don’t think I ever loved you, Hermione. Not like I love her.” Draco admitted lowly.Hermione’s head sunk to the floor, and she cried deeply within her hands. Everything she had done in her life was nothing but wasted time. Hermione would never get what she truly wanted, which was always going to be Draco.“Hmphhh?” Astoria breathed.Draco rushed to Astoria’s side and held her hand. “Sweetheart, I’m here, I’m here.”Astoria’s eyes bulged from her head, and she suddenly jumped to her feet to retrieve her wand. “STAY BACK! GET AWAY FROM ME!” She bellowed out.Draco jumped back and threw his arms in the air in surrender. “Hey, hey, Astoria it’s me! Please we need to get out of here.” Draco extended his hand and noticed how Astoria’s body shook.“You are not Draco, you’re not him!” Astoria said while shaking her head. “Please don’t take her! She’s mine! MINE!”Draco looked at Theo who appeared as confused as he was, until suddenly he peered down at the decaying corpse of the Dark Lord on the ground. Draco knew what he had to do get into Astoria’s mind to figure out the problem.Without blinking Draco muttered the spell, “Legilimens!” and dove into Astoria’s recent memories.Through the corners of her mind, he saw everything he missed. The trial from Astoria’s point of view, the escape from the Ministry, the birth of their daughter, and finally the memory that was causing her such distraught. Lord Voldemort Polyjuiced himself into Draco in attempts to trick Astoria.Draco understood and released himself from his wife’s mind. Catching his breath, he walked over to her slowly.“Astoria please listen to me. I am me, your husband. Ask me something only we would know, go on.”Astoria hesitated and finally nodded her head. She stepped forward and peered into his gray eyes.“Tell me what you said to me the night of the Opera.”Draco searched through his mind. The night of the Opera was an eventful night. It was the night when Astoria trusted (in bad faith) his mother with her memories, and the night Astoria gave a world class blowjob, but Draco knew the answer she was looking for.Draco stepped closer and took a deep breath. “You are the only light I have left in me.”Astoria smiled and threw her arms around him tight. He swung her in the air and kissed her head. Suddenly, Hermione jumped to her feet and charged toward Astoria. Draco swung Astoria out of the way and Hermione flung herself onto the tip of Draco’s wand.Hermione gripped onto the corner of her chest when her skin began to deteriorate, and her eyes bulged from her head. Draco’s wand was charmed with a poisonous spell, anyone who is penetrated by the wood of his wand, deteriorates until death.Hermione fell to the ground and hung onto her body, Astoria peered down at the dying witch and cocked her head.“Thank you, Hermione.” Astoria murmured as she watched Hermione’s body hit the floor.In many ways Astoria would forever be thankful for the sacrifices that Granger made, but regretfully they were all in vain.Draco stood in his stance unable to speak or make a move. Before his eyes was a witch who was erratically in love with him, and in the end, it was her love for him that consumed her, and killed her.“We should go.” Theo said hesitantly.Astoria clutched onto Draco’s arm and the trio Disapparated. Laying on the floor of St Mungo’s were the deteriorating corpses of two beings that let obsession kill them.A witch that had bushy brown hair, and a heart full of love that inevitably consumed more than her heart, but all the parts of her mind. Hermione sacrificed more than she could give for the man she thought was her soulmate, but in the end, Draco was her soulmate, but Hermione wasn’t his.Draco and Astoria apparated back to Andromeda’s home, and all of Britain was buzzing about Draco’s escape from the Ministry. The couple had a decision to make, remain hidden in Britain with Priscilla until it cooled down, or flee, without Priscilla. Priscilla deserved a stable home with two parents who were not on the Ministries’ most wanted list.“What are we going to do?” Astoria inquired while clutching onto Draco’s hand.“What we’ve always done...” Draco pulled her in close and murmured to her. “...stay together.”“What of Priscilla?”Draco lowered his head and pushed a piece of hair out of her face. “We’ll find a way to come back to her.”“Je vous aime” Astoria said against his lips.“Ditto.” Draco tipped up her chin and smiled while connecting their lips in a passionate kiss.                                                 THE END
