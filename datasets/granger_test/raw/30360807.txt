    The cold crisp air ran across his wind beaten face as he mounted his broom for the first time in months. His hair haphazardly whipped across his eyes and forehead as he took off into the air- he had missed this.As much as Draco Malfoy pretended he had not one iota of a care in the world- he in fact did, he cared.. he cared a lot- but showing it was like giving away a weakness for anyone to exploit. So he kept it hidden, hidden in the deepest parts of his mind.And what is it that he cared about? He tipped the front of his broom and spiraled down towards the ground at lightning speed- his eyes began to water with the ferocity of air crashing against his face as he plummeted. Closer, closer… just a little more…. He jumped his feet up to the end of his broom crushing them against the back to straighten out as he felt the splinters and twigs touch slightly to the grass.He cared.. about living. More importantly he wanted to care about living,- feeling alive after there had been so much death. He had come out of the war a different person, he would make himself care about living for all those that couldn’t. Being accepted back into Hogwarts after his trial with the Wizengamot was nothing short of a miracle and he would not waste it. Sure, he had been put on probation with a strict set of guidelines to follow – and of course, he was monitored by almost everyone who held any kind of power at this school but it was completely understandable. He had after all been the sole cause for the wizarding war to kick off at Hogwarts.That being the case he was just thankful that he still had a place to go after everything that had happened, his father and mother were under strict watch at their Manor and he had been allowed a small form of freedom on his return to the school- that he had helped decimate. He surely wasn’t going to complain. He would keep his head down, study hard, stay out of everyones way and hopefully finish the school year in one piece. Until then he was happy to be on his broom, as free as he could be without leaving the school grounds unless a teacher approved and kept a watchful eye otherwise alerting anyone monitoring to his ‘escape’.He touched back down after a while when he could no longer feel his face and went to the showers to help warm his aching bones.  ----------------------------------  “You can not be serious”, Hermione paced the office dumbfounded by the sheer audacity shown by the staff at Hogwarts. “Not only are we hosting known war criminals back in the very halls that they assisted in blowing up, but now we are also going to hold another Triwizard Tournament because the first one wasn’t damaging enough?” She threatened to wear a hole in the carpet that sat between the sitting area and the desk in front of her as a piercing set of eyes followed her movements carefully. “Miss Granger, as I am sure you are aware- the first Triwizard we held was…. somewhat swayed in the outcome. To promote house unity and school spirit, we feel that it would be beneficial for us to be involved in the upcoming one as it is after all a TRI-wizard Tournament. We must show the entire wizarding world that we have overcome and are moving forward after the war”. Headmistress McGonagall leant forward and placed her hands clasped firmly together on her desk as she eyed Hermione over the top of her half-moon glasses.Hermione stopped her pacing and gave a look of despair as she realized she wouldn’t be getting out of this- “and as for the ‘war criminals’” McGonagall looked pointedly at her as she continued, “they have each been tried and released, we are not to take sides in this matter and I would hope that you of all people will endeavor to promote acceptance for their return to Hogwarts. All eyes will be on you Miss Granger for your reactions and treatment of these students”. McGonagall looked back down towards her desk as she read from a piece of parchment.“This year the Triwizard Tournament will be held in France at the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, as Head Girl; yourself and Mister Nott will be expected to accompany us for the duration of the tournament. Hermione scoffed and rolled her eyes, off course she had to put her studies on hold to attend a stupid sporting tournament- just her luck. “Furthermore, all champions will be chosen from the 7th and 8th year students only to minimize the possibility of…..” McGonagall faulted, “well… the possibility of death”. She took off her glasses and ran her fingers over her closed eyes, pinching at the bridge of her nose. She was tired, she had taken over the head of school position and it had taken its toll.Hermione felt her anger shift, McGonagall wasn’t the reason that all of this was happening- Hermiones anger was not directed at her, she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Can anyone say- don’t shoot the messenger?The conversation seemed to be over as the Headmistress went back to reading her parchments sprawled over the entire desk. Hermione took her leave and headed back to her Heads common room.“Tangerine”, she spoke to the headless horseman statue in front of her Co-dorm. The horse circled around revealing a hole in the wall that Hermione walked through. She spied a large trunk in the middle of the room; uhh the Head Boy must have finally decided to move in from his Slytherin dormitory.She heard a small sigh from behind her as the horse stationed itself back into place- “Granger- I was wondering when I would run into you”. Theodore Nott came through the walkway and plopped himself lazily on the couch across from Hermione. “Theodore” she drawled out with a slight grimace on her face.“I know that you don’t like me… and I know you don’t think I deserve this position- but what can I say… all the other 8th years are either Death Eaters or are too dumb to qualify”. Theo shot her a winning smirk and pulled out a magazine to flick through. He continued as he skimmed over the pages without even reading- “maybe in light of everything we could… be friends?... show a bit of house unity?” There was that fucking phrase again. Hermione was getting sick of hearing people talk of house unity so soon after the battle of Hogwarts.“Oh of course Theo, ‘friends’” she used air quotations to promote her sarcasm- “and while we’re at it why don’t we throw in a fake relationship to really clear the air”. She scoffed loudly at the absurdity of it all.He lowered the magazine and smirked at her again- “Well, well Granger- if you wanted to snog me all you had to do was ask”. He winked at her and then let out a quick snigger when he saw her face flare with red rage.She stomped her foot and bee-lined for her bedroom before stopping at the doorway. “By the way Nott- we will be spending a lot more time together in about three weeks when we attend Beauxbatons for a re-do of the Triwizard Tournament. Apparently the other schools weren’t happy with Harrys winning due to the fact that the tournament had been tampered with- no one cares that it was due to a dark wizard trying to take over all of wizarding Britain and eliminate the muggle-born witches and wizards. But sure! Let’s throw a fucking ball and host some sports to make it all better!” She almost screamed the last part. She was panting for air as rage washed over her. Theo was looking at her like she had grown two heads and was spitting fire. She walked through her doorway and slammed it shut behind her before he had a chance to reply.  ------------------------- “You should have seen her mate- she was positively seething”. Theo was retelling the story for the third time in the Slytherin common room and Draco had well and truly had enough of hearing about the swotty Gryffindor princess and her inability to control her rage. Blaise Zabini was perched on the arm of a couch and was laughing uncontrollably- “Imagine that, bushy hair Granger with her panties in a twist”, he laughed harder wiping a stray tear from the corner of his eye. Draco eyed his friend and fellow Death Eater accomplice in the wizarding war- “Zabini, I would rather you never mention Grangers panties in my presence again” he deadpanned.“What’s the matter Draco, don’t want me talking about your little Gryffindor girlfriend- I know you don’t like to share”, he sniggered and Theo high-fived him across the coffee table. Draco looked over at Theo and scowled at him promptly stopping the laughing fit. “Why in the fuck would I care if you wanted to spend all your time fantasizing about that know-it-all bint with a broomstick up her arse?” Draco got up from his seat and went to leave the room.“Come on mate, we all know you both have had some weird ‘thing’ for each other all through school- going out of your way to torment her and all that. The build-up alone is enough to drive you both crazy. I’m surprised that you two haven’t hate fucked yet”. Blaise eyed Draco for his reaction. No emotion, emotion is weakness. “Never even crossed my mind Zabini”, Draco said as he walked to the doorway heading to his dormitory. “Good luck with your new room-mate Nott”, Draco called as he ascended the stairs.It had been all of two minutes before Theo poked his head into his old room where Draco was laying on his bed throwing a snitch into the air and catching it softly between his fingertips.“Drake, Blaise is a dick. Don’t pay any attention to him- I mean he just knows to push your buttons with her”. Why did everyone assume he had a ‘thing’ with Granger? Theo plonked down onto the bed across from Draco and watched him as he didn’t give the slightest indication that he wanted to be a part of this conversation. When Theo didn’t budge he realized he would need to say something to get him to leave- “I have literally bullied this girl since the start of Hogwarts, you and Zabini are fucking deluded if you think that I have any kind of feelings for her other than contempt”.Theo grinned- “You ever heard the phrase ‘pulling a girls pig-tails’? But hey… if you’re not interested, maybe I’ll take a crack and see where it goes? She did after all say she wanted to date me”.Draco missed the snitch as it came clumsily crashing down onto his face, it’s a tiny thing but surprisingly weighty. He heard Theo laughing as he got off the bed and walked over towards Draco.“Just say the word mate and I’ll leave her alone”. He walked out of the room and Draco sat in silence looking at the canopy of his four poster and wondering why on earth everyone thought he had a crush on the mentally deranged bint with a birds nest for hair.  ------------------- Hermione walked through the halls towards her second lesson back- Arithmancy was definitely not her favorite subject, it was however more sound in reasoning than Divinations and for that she was thankful they had offered it for NEWTS this year. She would need to get a head start on her work load before she had to leave for this ill timed trip to France. Don’t get me wrong, I love the idea of going to France. The beautiful sites, scrumptious foods, the amazing people, it was after all the city of love- however she was going to participate in something that had nothing to do with romance and more to do with death… fantastic.She entered the classroom and sat towards the front, reaching into her satchel she removed all her text books and parchment needed for the class. She was the first one there as per usual.She heard shuffling near the door. Oh joy. Theodore Nott sauntered in eyeing Hermione and smiled sweetly towards her. “What are you playing at Nott?” she asked cautiously.He grabbed a stray chair and flung it round straddling the back and facing her at her table. “Me?” he held his hand up to his heart in mock offence. “I would never play at anything Hermione. I just thought you and I should get to know each other- seen as we will be spending so much time together being Heads and all”. She was taken aback by his use of her first name but tried not to show it. He wanted to play this game, fine.“Yes, well I guess we should seem like we are trying to mend the schools perspective on certain types of people”. Hermione quirked her eyebrow at him. He chuckled. “So it’s settled-” Theo got up from his chair and Hermione was confused by the sudden cut off to the conversation. He walked around the table towards her and then sat square next to her at the desk planting his books down firmly making Hermione jump at the sound.What in the hell was happening. Hogwarts had gone to hell in a hand basket. Just as she righted herself a familiar site walked through the door and she held her breath as the blond locks sauntered over- much the same way as Theo- did they teach all Slytherins how to walk a certain way when they were sorted into the house? Draco Malfoy eyed Hermione and her new company and a sneer crossed his face as he tried to hide his distaste with little avail.He walked to the back of the room and Hermione could breathe again. Theo leaned over and whispered in her ear- she almost jumped at the proximity. “Can I borrow a quill Grang- Hermione?”She heard a crunching noise behind her and looked around to see Malfoy holding a quill split in two as he looked down at his text book. He must have read something he didn’t like. Hermione reached into her satchel and pulled out a spare that she had and handed it to Theo. In the spirit of fake friendship.As they sat listening to the professor drone on about Gods knows what she was distracted by a flutter of paper that touched down onto the desk before Theo. He groaned audibly and unfurled the paper plane that had flown itself into his lap. Make sure you shower before you head back to the Slytherin Common Room- don’t want to smell of dirty swot.Hermione didn’t have to think twice at who it would have been that sent that note. She turned around in her chair as the Professor concluded their class and the students began to rise from their seats.“You would think by now Malfoy that you could come up with something new- piss poor effort honestly- then again you haven’t really been winning any battles recently have you?” She gave a smirk worthy of a Slytherin and turned back around to pack up her books. Theo gave a quick chuckle as he stayed well clear of the fight about to happen before his eyes.Hermione could hear the sneer in his voice as he retorted- “Watch it Granger, if I wasn’t on probation I’d let you know exactly what I think of you and trust me it would definitely not be anything you had heard from me before”.Theo piped in “that’s for sure” as he tried to hide a shit eating grin. Malfoy shot a glare at him as Hermione slung her bag over her shoulder and made for the exit. She didn’t have time for this shit back and forth- nor could she be bothered- it had been going on for so long now she didn’t think that anything Draco Malfoy had to say would ever surprise her at this point.She walked out without another glance and heard Theo call after her a halfhearted goodbye.

    The next week had been a strain to say the least- Draco had tried his hardest to avoid the brunette dolt that seemed to be in every single bloody one of his classes. She passed him constantly in the hallways, she sat opposite him in the Great hall at mealtimes and he couldn’t go and see Theo without her being in the Heads common room making everything ridiculously awkward.It’s not that she made things awkward, it’s just that Draco realized he had to change how he interacted with her because apparently there was a ‘thing’ that he hadn’t known about and he couldn’t have that… so, he just did his best to stay out of her way- problem solved.
  Problem not solved. 
He sat in potions randomly stirring in his Billywig wings as he sliced through the Baneberry on his board simultaneously. This was half his marks for the term, all he needed to do was get the potion perfect and he was on his way to a perfect NEWTs score.His eyes dropped to the ingredients list as he ran over one last time the items he had on his bench- potions were such temperamental things, one wrong step or an ingredient added at the wrong time and it all turned to shit.
  Shit…
Draco noticed he was missing one, Essence of Daisyroot- he shot from his chair and into the potions cupboard as fast as he could- the Daisyroot was next to go in. He rounded the corner of shelving and abruptly halted at the witch standing in his way of the very vial he needed.“Move Granger! I need that Daisyroot now, otherwise my potion will separate”.Hermione looked at him and reached for the small tube containing a muddy colored liquid and Dracos eyes flashed to the small peek of skin that emerged from her waist as her shirt rode up. His eyes darted away but he knew she had seen him.“You mean this Malfoy?” she teased.“Yes quickly bint, give it here!”“Hmm…” she tapped the vial against her chin. “Not until you say please”.Draco growled low in his throat and felt his fists clench- he swallowed his pride for a moment just to get through his class. “Please…. Granger…” he hissed out.“So he does have manners”, Hermione laughed, an evil grin crossed her face quickly. “Now beg for it…”Dracos reaction was not one that he was expecting- the words sent a shudder through his body, his cock twitched as she said the word ‘beg’. Her eyes were staring into his as she watched his face change. Surely she couldn’t tell what was going through his mind. He straightened his shoulders and brought himself up to his full height, intimidation might work.“I do not beg”, he growled as he stared her down- this was a fight he was not going to lose.“I guess you don’t really want it then-” Hermione reached her hand up and motioned to throwing the vial to the ground as Draco launched at her grasping onto her hand and closing his fist over hers. They pushed and pulled at the hand covering the tube- “Get the fuck off me Malfoy!”“Give me that bloody root Granger. I swear to Merlin I will have you for this”, Draco had her up against the wall in the potions cupboard as shelves were knocked and puffs of colorful clouds were released through the room as vials fell and smashed on the floor.“What in Gods name is happening in here! Mister Malfoy! Miss Granger! Both of you out here at once!” Slughorn grabbed at their robes and pulled them both through the cupboard and out into the classroom, sporting colored splotches and disheveled appearances they were paraded in front of the entire class as they continued to hold tightly to the vial. Draco became acutely aware that he was in fact holding Grangers hand and quickly let go running his fingers through his hair to try and tame it.Slughorn dismissed the other students and continued to berate them long into their dinner hour- “Miss Granger, I should expect better from you being Head Girl”. Slughorn said in a disappointed tone. “And as for you Mister Malfoy, I would have thought that the last thing you wanted to do this year was get into fights and draw attention to yourself”.Draco nodded his head to agree, “Twenty points from each house and two nights detention”.Hermione groaned audibly and then shot her hand up to her mouth to cover her faux pas. Draco smirked but quickly caught himself and dipped his face. “Right, well- get yourselves cleaned up and then come back here to fix the mess you both made- tonight will be your first night of detention. I expect this dungeon to sparkle once you have finished”.Draco left without another work and wound his way through the hallways back to his dorm. He peeled off his shirt in the room ready to slip into the bathroom to shower when the door opened behind him and in walked Blaise and Theo. Brilliant.“So that was quite the show you two put on in potions today”, Theo took a bite out of the apple he had brought into the room and he grinned with a wedge in his mouth.“Leave it Theo- it was nothing”. Draco grabbed his towel off the end of his bed.Blaise walked over to cover the doorway to the bathroom. Fuck. “Hey Theo-?” Blaise called to his friend across the room. “Yes Blaise?” Draco rolled his eyes.“I thought that Draco and Granger weren’t hate fucking. I mean that’s what he told us”. Blaise grinned mischievously towards Draco.“I believe he did say that didn’t he”. Theo retorted as they continued their conversation as though Draco wasn’t even there.“And yet… today all we could hear was yelling coming from the potions cupboard- something about giving you a root Drake? And that you will have her?” Dracos cheeks went red, well that was just taken way out of context.Theo piped in- “Not to mention the banging and crashing of you two jumping each other in there, coming out looking thoroughly shagged and holding hands”.“You both know full well I am not shagging Granger- all of this was a complete misunderstanding that went way too far”. Draco would say just about anything right now to get out of this conversation. “You think that after everything I have done, to her and to this school that she would even consider being with someone like me?” Draco laughed- it wasn’t genuine and everyone in that room could tell.They went silent.“You’ll never know if you don’t try mate”, Theo looked at him with a gentle smile on his face. Theo turned on his heel and moved towards the door grabbing Blaise and pulling him from the room before he could say anything in jest.Draco walked to his bathroom and started the shower- he turned the tap to scolding hot to wash away his thoughts and the emotions circling like buzzards. Tonight is going to ruin him. 
  ----------------------------

   
Hermione stalked her way back to the potions classroom after her shower in the Prefects bathroom. She had a shower in her head Dorm but she didn’t think she could bring herself to face Theo right now with what happened during potions. No doubt he would have some snide comment to make about her ‘tryst’ with Malfoy in the potions cupboard.As she walked past the Great hall Ginny approached her- full of energy, the fiery little red-head bound up and settled in stride with Hermione. “Did you hear, we are heading to Paris! I’m so bloody excited Min!”Hermione looked at her friend with her eyebrows raised- “yes McGonagall told me a few weeks ago- I can’t believe how much school we will miss going to this stupid tournament”. Ginny began to laugh- “you would have to be the only person in the history of Hogwarts that would rather stay here and study than go to ‘the city of love’ on a brilliant trip”.“I don’t know about you but my idea of visiting Paris is falling in love under the Eiffel Tower- not battling Dragons and escaping near death”, Hermione said matter-of-factly.Ginny wiggled her eyebrows, “well you never know- maybe Beauxbatons can introduce you to some lovely French boys that will sweep you off your feet. That’s what I will be doing with my time there”. Hermione gawked at her friend and couldn’t help the fits of laughter that overtook them both. They spent the next few minutes talking about the ideal French gentleman that they both would meet and fall in love with on their trip away. Tall, handsome, well-read, brave- all the best qualities.Ginny stopped short of the dungeons- “so, detention with Malfoy”. She grimaced.“Yep, I’m presuming you heard what happened?”Ginny flushed- “well a very out there rendition- something about potions flying everywhere and you two up against a wall, then there was something about Malfoy holding your hand… bloody outrageous how the rumor mill runs if you ask me”, she scoffed.Hermiones eyes darted to the floor and she turned a certain shade of red, not being able to make eye contact with Ginny.“No. Fucking. Way!” Ginny eyed her friend as she realized that the rumor mill had in fact been one hundred percent true- “umm, details please…”Hermione looked up- “It was really nothing- honestly”.“Now!” Ginny ordered. Hermione sighed.“He just came in and started demanding ingredients.. and then he was staring at me, well not at me but at my waist when I reached for the vial he needed. Anyway I told him he had to ‘beg for it’”, Hermione chuckled quickly then continued as Ginny stared at her with a quirked eyebrow and a sly smile. “He didn’t want to, so I threatened to smash it- then he just fucking attacked me… It was all very barbaric- I really can’t believe that I got detention for this, I mean Malfoy was the one who started it all”.Ginny was silent-“What? Why are you looking at me like that?” Hermione put her hands on her hips and pouted.“You like him don’t you…?” Ginny smirked.Hermione paused for a second, fumbling for the right words. “It’s.. it’s Malfoy!” Hermione could not believe what she was hearing- unbelievably! Draco fucking Malfoy!“Well you’re not denying it… besides he is pretty fit- I mean for a Ex- Death Eater and all…” Ginny laughed. “Either way, McGonagall approved his attendance for the trip supposedly so you will get quite a bit of time together over the next few weeks- you never know what will happen in the ‘city of love’”.Hermione hit Ginnys arm as she backed away- Ginny started on a chorus of ‘Hermione and Malfoy sitting in a tree’ as she quickly retreated from the dungeons. ---------------------------------- Draco sauntered slowly down to the potions classroom after taking a long hot shower feeling slightly calmer and relaxed. He took a breath before opening the door slowly, sighing at his terrible misfortune- this was going to suck.He walked in to find the room empty, boxes lined the desks and there were obvious signs of cleaning in progress. He lazily wandered over to the potions cupboard and entered- taking in the mess in front of him. Draco turned the corner to the shelving that was involved in this afternoons chaos and stopped in his tracks- before him was a perfectly firm curvaceous arse; he swallowed the lump in his throat and licked his lips. The fine figure before him was bent over picking up vials from the floor….. picking up vials…. In the potions classroom…. At the same time that detention had been set…. Fuck. “Granger…”The girl stiffened at his voice and then shot up turning to face him. Shit it was her.Draco nervously shifted from one foot to the other and composed himself. He knew that she was considered attractive by other guys at school- to be fair she did have some qualities that Draco himself found… alluring… specifically her fine arse apparently. But he shouldn’t… she wouldn’t… Draco stopped his thought, there’s no way in hell that Granger would ever even consider someone like him. After everything that they had been through together and how he had treated her- he distanced himself on purpose after they returned for their 8th year. He knew her distain for him and he hadn’t known how to treat her any different, not being able to live with himself if he actually tried and she rejected his attempts at friendship.“Let’s just get this over with Malfoy, the less time I have to spend with you the better”. He winced at her words. Okay so maybe he would have to work a bit harder than he thought.They worked tirelessly into the night fixing broken glass tubes and shelving that had fallen in their scuffle and after what seemed like hours they were finally finished. Not one word had been said during the entire process. Draco looked ragged and tired, he picked up his robes from the back of a chair and slung it over his shoulder- “night Granger”, he said as he made his way to the door.“You spend all night in silence then drop that before you leave? I don’t understand you Malfoy. You put on this bad boy persona and walk around stomping your feet but then you say that just as you leave?” she scoffed and folded her arms across her chest.He held gently to the door handle and looked down at the floor. It had been a long night, his defences were down. “Maybe I don’t want to stomp my feet anymore”, he almost whispered. Draco opened the door and slipped out before Hermione could say anything else.

    Hermione scrambled under her covers and settled into her comfortable mattress as she attempted to sleep. Her mind was whirling in and endless loop of the night she had just spent cleaning the potions cupboard- more precisely the night that ended in Draco fucking Malfoy acting like an actual normal human being for once in his life. She had to admit that she had been watching him that night; when he wasn't looking of course. Highly impressed by his muscular physic, he was so tall and broad- he had gained a healthy amount of weight after the war and it hadn't gone unnoticed that he was quite attractive. She stole glances as he carried crates, the candlelight shining off his flexing arms- his blonde hair radiating in the light. Gods, when had Malfoy become attractive?Rolling on her side and completely unsettled she could hear the dull drone of Theo snoring from the other room and picked up her wand to cast a muffling spell across her doorway.
  And what the fuck was that at the end- ‘I don’t want to stomp my feet anymore’?
Was he saying he wanted to be a good person in general? Did he want to be nicer to her? Fat bloody chance on that one. So much to unpack from the one and only sentence he had said to her all night and now she wasn’t going to get one wink of sleep because of it. Draco fucking Malfoy. This seemed to be her new mantra at the moment.--The next few days went off without a hitch. Her second night of detention was spent with McGonagall planning the trip to France and she had managed to avoid the tall, blonde and handsome during her classes and at meals... Did she say handsome..? She meant tall, blonde and vile.It was drawing nearer to the date of departure for their trip and a lot of the 7th and 8th years had taken to rigorous training schedules in preparation for the Triwizard. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas were duelling constantly in the courtyard; slinging hexes and curses at each other to build up speed and reaction. Ginny was constantly flying on her broom and was adamant that she would enter this year to secure her place in the Chuddley Cannons once she concluded her studies. The Triwizard Tournament would be the perfect occasion to show off her amazing flying skills.Neville was just looking forward to going on the trip to see the sites that Paris had to offer and had asked Hermione if she would enjoy a trip to the Louvre with him while they were there. She had graciously accepted and knew that he had chosen the Louvre due to its muggle history and Hermiones fascination with anything educational.Other than the main Gryffindors she had overheard Blaise Zabini talk about his entrance to the cup and ‘how much French puss’.... Well I’m sure you can guess the rest. Hermione had deducted points from Slytherin swiftly for that comment.Theo had been very upfront with Hermione in the common room one evening informing her that he couldn’t think of anything better than heading to the River Seine for the days to rest on the banks with a good book- she had to admit that his idea for Paris was increasingly growing on her. He clucked his tongue when he saw her smile at his answer- “you’re welcome to join Hermione- cheese and wine are compulsory, clothing is optional”. He shot her a wink as he walked off. Bloody Slytherin.However the one person she hadn’t heard any response about was Malfoy. Would he be participating in the tournament- a chance at school redemption? Or did he just want to lay low?Hermione reminded herself that she absolutely shouldn’t give two flying fucks whether he wanted to risk his life for some stupid cup...Most of the students had not returned for an 8th year at Hogwarts- Harry and Ron had left to join the Auror training program and all that was left were mainly a few Gryffindors and some Slytherins- oh and Luna, she had made no secret of her wanting to follow Neville around Paris and hopefully after as well. Neville was keeping his distance, not knowing how to take her extremely strong advances.The morning had arrived; all their trunks had been packed and taken outside to the carriages that would be transporting them by Thestrals to Beauxbatons. Each carriage could hold around twenty students and two teachers. As there was a shortage of teachers they were running low on volunteers to accompany students for the full event.McGonagall gathered the students around and pulled out a large scroll from her sleeve- “I should not have to remind each of you that we will be attending in representation of Hogwarts, and as such I expect the highest amount of discipline and respect while we are at Beauxbatons” she paused. “Any behavior deemed unsuitable will result in disqualification from entering the tournament and also house points being taken”.McGonagall looked immediately towards Seamus, “please for the love of Merlin, do not blow anything up” there was a quiet chuckle from a number of 8th years.“7th years will separate into groups of 15 and will have 2 professors to a carriage. The 8th years will take one carriage as all 14 of you will fit into the one”. Hermiones eyes darted to the side of the group immediately towards the slimy Slytherin and she noticed a slight smirk and his eyebrow raised. Shit- she had done so well avoiding him, now she had to take a five hour carriage ride with him. Fantastic.They piled into the carriage that had a maximizing charm on it; from the outside it looked to seat four but inside it was vastly bigger and wider. There were small tables down the centre for them to study and eat lunch at and seating along the sides. Hermione took her seat at the back and waited for the rest of the group to file in.There was a small squeal from the front of the carriage as a familiar red head popped inside- “McGonagall let me ride with the 8th years”, Ginny squeezed her way into a seat next to Hermione and she was bloody grateful that she had a friend to talk to. “Apparently being Harry Potters ex and a big part of the war gives a bit of pull around here” Ginny whispered to Hermione. Theo sat on the other side and started laughing.Hermione cleared her throat and glared cheekily at Theo. “Theodore Nott this is Ginny Weasley, you two may not have met properly due to Theo being best friends with the big blonde prat and all”. They both started laughing and then stopped abruptly. “Umm hi” Ginny said quietly.“To be fair, I’m still best friends with the big blonde prat- but I’m also Head boy, which means I now have to be nice to everyone no matter their house”.Ginny stumbled at what to reply to his statement. “Uh, ok…?” confusion ran across her face. Hermione butted in “Theo stop tormenting her, she doesn’t know your fucked up humor yet”. Theo laughed back at Hermione and then winked at Ginny- “don’t worry love, you will learn quick”. Ginny flushed red then turned away to talk to Dean Thomas.----------------------------------- They had taken off into the air to the excitement of some of the girls peering out the windows. Well on their way to France and Draco could feel the weight being lifted from him as the feeling of freedom set in.Draco couldn’t help his gaze shift- sitting at the very end of the carriage he looked down towards the  other end where Theo had taken the spot next to Granger, it’s not like he was going to sit there, but he didn’t think Theo should either.Blaise nudged his shoulder and brought him back to reality. “You know if you stare at her enough she might just fall in love with you” he chuckled next to him. Draco turned to scold him- “I wasn’t staring at Granger, I was staring at Theo pining over the Weasley girl”.“Funny, I don’t recall saying a name there… but sure, why don’t you tell me more about how you don’t fancy taking a peek under those swotty Gryffindor robes. See if the little prudey princess is hiding a sneaky sexy bod”. Blaise over exaggerated a wink and Draco elbowed him in the ribs.“Alright, alright- quiet down you lot! Finnigan called from the middle of the carriage. “Now, in the true theme of house unity I propose a toast” he pulled out two bottles of fire whiskey from his robes that he had concealed while departing and the guys in the carriage let out a cheer in unison. Draco looked around the carriage- hmm no professors. They must have trusted the 8th years to act responsibly, big fucking mistake.Thomas reached under the tables and pulled out tumblers for each person- Finnigan began to pour. They handed around the glasses and everyone raised them in the air mimicking the boys.“To truth” Finnigan called. The entire carriage confused at the strange toast but still called- “to truth” as they all downed their drinks in one go- “and to dare” Finnigan called out. There were puzzled looks throughout the students as they contemplated what the boys were up to.“Oh, I hope you don’t mind” Finnigan said- “I thought we could liven things up with a game of truth or dare on the way. I put a small amount of Veritaserum in the whiskey before we left- it should kick in shortly…shall we play?”Draco began to laugh at the sheer outrage plastered over half of the carriage, mainly the Gryffindors. Not only did the Slytherins enjoy a good drink, they also appreciated a well planned scheme.Longbottom looked as though he were about to throw up, however Draco wasn’t sure if that was from the idea of drinking truth serum or the tiny drop of alcohol that he had consumed. His eye was caught by the tiny brunette witch sitting by Theo- a look of shock horror across her face. What does she have to hide?“I’m in” Theo called from the other end of the carriage. He was joined by most of the snakes who were keen on the game and passing the time. Zabini looked over to the left over Gryffindors and made a clucking noise as he held of sniggers. Slowly the group of acceptance increased and all that was left were the she Weasel and Granger. Oh and Longbottom, but he doesn’t count.Loony Lovegood was surprisingly the one to put her hand up for first. Thomas went in hard- “Luna, classic game of marry, fuck, kill- from this carriage, remember you are on the veritaserum so no one can lie”.She looked around at her prospects and thought for a moment before she concluded her answer- “marry- Neville because I secretly have a crush on him”. She didn’t even blink as she spat out that extra bit of information. Someone called out “it’s not secret love” and she went red.“Fuck- would have to be Seamus, I would just like to hear you say ‘come for me love’ in that sexy accent of yours”. The entire carriage erupted with whooping and cheers as Luna again blushed scarlet but joined in the laughing. Finnigan puffed out his chest and commented along the lines that he would do that any time she would let him. Draco turned to see Hermione hiding a giggle behind her hands as she tried to not show her interest in the game.As the commotion died down the last section came- she looked over to him- “and kill… sorry Draco” she shrugged her shoulders with a genuine sadness in her eyes and didn’t add anything more, in some ways that was probably best.“Okay Luna, it’s your turn to choose” Thomas said.She pointed her finger towards Blaise and he shifted slightly in his seat. Draco smirked, he saw his friends uncomfortable tell as soon as he had done it. “Dare, I guess” Blaise replied.Loony gave a cheeky grin and said “I dare you to kiss the girl you find most desirable in this carriage”.Blaise fists clenched at his sides, was he really going to do this. I mean at the end of the day a kiss was nothing when it came to Slytherins playing this game.Blaise got up from his chair and everyone began their onslaught of wolf whistles and cheering again as he walked down the center of the carriage. Stopping… right in front of Granger…Draco could feel his blood boiling, his heart was racing. Why had Blaise never told him that he fancied Granger? Draco was fighting with the impulse to drag him away from her, he had no claim to Granger, nor did he have feelings for her- not really… fuck… did he?He could see her tense up as she realized that Blaise was going to kiss her and he became rigid as he desperately wanted to protect her and stop this from happening. Her eyes darted over towards Draco- had he imagined it? Was she just reacting to him looking at her?He dropped his head and looked at the floor as he heard the cheers grow louder, Blaise must have kissed her… Dracos heart sank slightly. I fucking hate this game.
  
    Chapter Text
    Blaise had given her the tiniest peck on the lips that she thought anyone ever possibly could have, she didn’t even know if they had honestly connected it was that miniscule. Not that she was complaining. Her stupid mind had been racing before he had leant down and she had glanced over towards Malfoy, he had been watching her- the look on his face was almost enough for her to run and hide at the other end of the carriage to avoid kissing Blaise. It was a mix between hurt and anger, she didn’t think she would ever forget it.The game quickly progressed and another round of drinks was handed out to everyone, Seamus implied the importance of continuing the small doses of veritaserum and the alcohol of course didn’t hurt.Blaise then picked Thomas who subsequently had to read from an extremely risky version of Karma Sutra through the ages for twenty pages.Thomas chose Padma, the only other girl apart from Ginny, Luna and Hermione. Padma had to give Thomas a thirty minute back-rub while the game continued and Padma had her turn at choosing.“Ginny-” crimson peaked the top of her cheeks as her name was called. “Truth or dare?”“Umm truth”. Ginny swallowed the lump in her throat.“What was it like to have sex with Harry Potter?” Hermione almost barfed in the carriage as she saw the stars swimming around Padma’s eyes. Ginny choked on her words… “I uh… I’m… well…”Hermione grasped hold of Ginnys hand in support… would she really tell this entire carriage full of her peers that she was still a virgin and she and Harry never had sex before they broke up.“I choose dare!” Ginny blurted out. Finnigan hushed the others as he deliberated and then agreed to her request. Padma looked like someone had pissed in her pumpkin juice.“Fine. I dare you to kiss the Head Boy”. Ginny shuffled in her seat and looked seriously uncomfortable with the situation. Hermione could feel Theo practically vibrating on the seat next to her. She quietly laughed to herself and leant over to whisper to Ginny- “it’s okay, he’s actually sweet”.Ginny seemed to find her resolve as Hermiones words passed over her. She got up from her seat and as she walked towards Theo he got up from his so that she wouldn’t have to bend. Pureblood upbringing. Ginny reached out and pressed her hand gently to the side of Theos cheek and leant in- pressing her lips softly against his. They stayed together for a surprisingly long time before breaking apart. Ginny quickly scuttled back to the safety of her seat and Theo kind of stood there for a few seconds longer, Hermione reached out grabbing his robes and pulling him back down to his seat. She thought she could see stars in his eyes.Ginny looked around to Hermione, she had to choose now and she knew Hermione would be safe by choosing her.Ginny called out her choice and the carriage went quiet, wondering if Hermione would even play… she presumed. “Truth or dare Hermione?”“Truth” she fumbled out quickly.
  Safe option, please be something safe.
“Marry, fuck, kill” Ginny said cautiously.
  Shit
Hermione was sweating bullets, she didn’t know if she could answer this question without accidentally saying a certain blonde ferrets name. But what if the dare was worse?Seamus piped in- “if you want to pick me for the first two love, I’m more than happy to oblige”.She didn’t even know that was an option, choosing one person for multiple. Oh shit.It wasn’t that she hadn’t thought about Draco Malfoy, it was that she had thought about Draco fucking Malfoy way too much of recent. Her actively avoiding him had not prevented the thought popping into her mind about what it would be like to kiss him, to have him touch her in all kinds of wonderful places, to… be with him... But this idea was new, what would it be like to be a Lady of a Manor? Malfoy Manor to be precise. Oh no.. Her mind was running away from her- she had now thought about him for all categories but one. However she had indeed thought about killing him in the past however, does that count?Too much time had passed and she was running out of ways to stop thinking about Malfoy!“What would the dare be?” she almost shouted at Ginny.Ginny was warily watching her. “Umm, I guess kiss someone that you most fancy and tell us why?”She leant over and said in Hermiones ear-“just kiss Neville and say because he is a nice guy”Hermione paled. She wouldn’t be able to lie in the second part of that saying she most fancied Neville. She was royally fucked.“Come on Granger. Spit it out”. Blaise called from the end, a chorus of voices echoed through her head as she weighed up her options. Just lie. Her mind said; you are strong enough to beat this potion. She knew she wasn’t.Maybe if she started out slow with the truth she could spin it nicely her way, pretend the slimy git wasn’t even there. Yes the sexy, fit as fuck Slytherin down the end there. 
  Oh no… this was going to be bad.
She cleared her throat, start off slow with marry- Neville would be the easy option, sweet and loyal Neville.“I would Marry-“…. She paused… “marry” ….Neville….N-E-V-I-L-L-E… come on, fuck, Hermione get it together… can’t even answer one easy question.“I would marry... MarryfuckandkillMalfoy. FUCK!”She flung her head into her hands and buried her face in her lap as the carriage went silent at her outburst. Ginny gasped next to her and she heard Blaise roar into laughter. Seamus, please with his game causing so much controversy chuckled-“I always wondered if you two would get together… too bad Malfoy won’t get to enjoy a long happy marriage with your plans to kill him”.Hermione felt like she was going to pass out, she could not believe that she had just said that in front of him. Fuck my fucking life.Ginny ran her hand across Hermiones back trying to comfort her as the carriage returned to normal chatter. In an attempt to get the attention off Hermiones revelations Ginny told Seamus to take Hermiones turn at choosing. There was no way Hermione could bring herself to raising her head in case he was looking at her.----------------------------------- Had he just heard that right….. Had Hermione ‘the golden girl’ Granger just said she wanted to marry and fuck him? Kill as well, but we won’t dwell on that one. Blaise slapped him on the shoulder in congrats as he bellowed out an almighty laugh.Draco felt completely weightless, like a cloud. Maybe he was having an out of body experience. Either way the girl he had been fantasizing about had just admitted to fantasizing about him too.There was a lot that Draco needed to unpack from this little game, certainly nothing that he could do involving anyone in this carriage being present- apart from Granger of course.
  This was turning into the best Triwizard he had ever been a part of; well the last wasn’t much to live up to that’s for sure.
Finnigan handed out a fourth round of drinks to everyone and there was a noticeable buzz in the air, feeling the effects of the alcohol hitting them. Fire whiskey was definitely not a soft drink and the way that Finnigan was pouring they would certainly be sloshed and completely truthful by the time they arrived at Beauxbatons. It seemed that they were most of the way there now, having taken small breaks during the game to chat and look out the window at the passing towns and countryside.“Ok, down those and lets keep on shall we? Nott, your turn”.Theo jutted his chin into the air and called out dare.“Show us how the French kiss a pretty girl mate” Finnigan finished shotting a fifth drink he had poured himself.Draco was about to lose his shit. I swear to Merlin if Theo touches Granger I will tear his arms off and then his French fucking tongue.Theo looked over towards Draco and his heart sank- he was going to do it.Getting up from his seat he turned slightly to face her, Draco stood without thinking and Blaise grabbed at his robes to reef him back down. Theo was standing right in front of her.He took one more step to the side and leant down planting an absolute stunner of a kiss on… Weasley. Theo was firm and passionate, he tilted her head as he deepened the kiss moving his tongue to explore her mouth. At first she was still, stunned even? Then she melted against him, gasping as he grabbed the back of her neck. The kiss going on and on, full of emotion and heat- the passion of the French.Draco looked over and Hermione had raised her head at the commotion happening around her. Stunned to see Ginny kissing Theo she was taken aback but snuck a glance towards Draco, when she saw him watching her she quickly looked away again back to the animated scene happening right next to her.Theo almost had to be pulled off Ginny as everyone started to become uncomfortable at the lengths this kiss seemed to be heading towards.“I think we all need another drink” Thomas yelled. Everyone cheered, more so to loosen up. “Nott you big dolt, your turn”.Theo turned his head towards him and Draco froze. Don’t you fucking dare. Draco mouthed towards Theo. A smirk crossed the young Slytherins face and Draco knew straight away he shouldn’t have challenged him.“Strip” was all Theo said towards Draco.Again there was a roar of laughter vibrating through the carriage as they all worked out who Theo was gesturing towards.“You are off your rocker mate- no fucking way”.“Would you prefer a truth Draco?” Theo asked, knowing what the answer would be.Draco was furious- how bloody degrading… there was no way Nott would get away with this. He stood from his seat and undid his Slytherin green and silver tie. Pulling it from his neck he slowly began to undo the tiny buttons on his crisp white shirt.During the war Draco had been subject to harsh training regimes and built up his fitness and muscle, he was no longer the lean, skinny teen he was during his first six years at Hogwarts. The shirt flexed as he grasped it tightly and slid it from his shoulders. There was a collective gasp from the carriage as each person took in his torso.Tight muscular shoulders that met the lean hard swell of his heaving chest, rippling abs and a pronounced V at the base of his stomach that dared anyone who looked to lower their gaze. The taught fit body he hid under his nicely pressed shirts was covered in scars and slices from a life so far filled with pain.He couldn’t tell if everyone was staring at his body or the marks that flecked his pale skin. Stilling under their gaze he didn’t know what to do next, he took in the eyes that glazed over him but he was only interested in one pair. Her hazel brown eyes were wide with wonder, she didn’t look concerned about the scars- she wasn’t frightened by his past injuries… she looked… impressed?Draco couldn’t quite pick it. She had her eyes focused on his stomach then spanned up to his chest- it wasn’t until she met his eyes that she seemed to snap out of her appraisal and abruptly averted her gaze and turned the deepest shade of red that Draco had ever seen. Her embarrassed state was enough to send a shiver up Dracos spine- she had been staring at him, she was embarrassed when he caught her staring. What did that mean?The she Weasle looked like she was almost drooling and Padma was wolf whistling as the guys around the carriage were laughing and cheering for Draco to put on a show. This was definitely well out of his comfort zone. Blaise had found his way to the floor in fits as his eyes watered at the obvious uncomfortable state of Draco.He grabbed at his belt buckle and drew the end out, slowly.. Can’t believe I’m actually fucking doing this. Theo was carrying a look of complete surprise on his face as he stared, not entirely sure if what he was watching was real. Draco unhooked the loop and then slid the belt to the side releasing the clasps. The belt fell loosely to the side as he began playing with the buttons on his trousers- his gaze caught by familiar dark and lust filled eyes… the carriage made a shuddering movement and began to descend from the air at an alarming rate.The moment faded as they all scrambled to put on clothing or to look from the window at the scene coming into view from under the clouds in Paris. The only two left, unmoved, still gazing… Draco and Hermione.
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione stepped from the open door and onto the cobblestone streets of Paris taking in a gasping breath. What a site this was- she was absolutely taken by the gorgeous scenery, the early style architecture, how every person just screamed beautiful and bright- even the bloody breeze smelled of fresh bread and sweet jam condiments. The Thestrals were transfigured as they pulled into Paris outskirts to resemble horses and they were careful not to let too many out of a carriage at once as to not draw attention to themselves. This would have been an easy task; had the entire 8th year carriage not been completely ‘off their faces’ drunk and spouting endless truths to any question asked of them. Hermione had secretly ‘downed’ the forth shot out the window of the carriage as to not have a repeat of the completely awkward and embarrassing moment she had told everyone that she wanted to ‘fuck, marry and then kill’ Draco (here it is again) fucking Malfoy. She was determined after that point to prevent her inhibitions from running away any further.A small crowd began to form close to the group of students as they exited their transportation. Hermione was immediately set upon by a huddle of merchants who were attempting to sell her all kinds of knick-knacks and such, she began to apologize and say she didn’t have any money- nor did she understand a word of what they were saying to her but she believed it was being lost in translation. Ginny attempted to step in to shoo the merchants away, they were extremely persistent.A young boy reached out to Hermione and grabbed her wrist tugging gently on it to motion her forward. The instinct in her allowed her to step a number of paces to follow the little boy- no older than ten she suspected. A firm hand grabbed hold of her arm just above where the boy was holding her and she heard a low growl emanating from behind her.The boy looked next to Hermione with a scowl plastered across his face as he quickly let go and ran away. Hermione rounded on the source of the primitive actions. Draco stood beside her with his hand still clasped around her forearm, he softened his touch slightly but didn’t let go.“What did you do that for, he was only a boy”.Draco looked angry. “Granger, they are street kids- they are brought up to pick-pocket, and those that are lucky enough to lure away a child or young woman will take them back to their carer for all kinds of unspeakable things”. Hermione stiffened at the idea that she had almost gone with the young boy.“He.. but he was only a boy; we should go and help him”. She became upset at the idea of this defenseless child being raised in a life of crime and made to do terrible things.“If we follow him, we will not be seen again- I can assure you of that. The boy is well taken care of, he is groomed and fed to give off the idea that he is not what he is but they are quite dangerous”. He looked down at his hand still holding her arm and he slowly let go before he turned away and began to walk off.“Thank you” Hermione called after him, he turned back to face her. “I mean, well for stopping me from making a terrible mistake. I didn’t know, I just… well.. thank you”.“Don’t mention it”. Draco stalked off and re-joined the group of Slytherins who were all joking and laughing in a circle with the other 8th years. It seemed that house unity had prevailed in their carriage.McGonagall rounded the corner after exiting a large wrought iron gate and called to her students. “Welcome to Beauxbatons- she pointed to a dingey looking park that had all of one swing that apparently classified as a ‘playground’. They were all silent as they looked at the very underwhelming scene before them.But with magic, nothing is ever as it seems. Hermione knew that all too well. She looked over to Ginny and squeezed her friends hand tightly in excitement as they walked up to the gates that were closed, sectioning off the sad excuse for a park. Before she opened them McGonagall called out a number of spells and tapped her wand on the gate in four different places.The moment the gates were forced forward a completely different landscape appeared through. Large Mountain ranges in the distance- rolling hills that were covered in vineyards, blaringly beautiful sun that kissed Hermiones skin as she bathed in it. But most extraordinary of all was the magnificently ornate castle that spanned across the horizon. It was probably half the size of Hogwarts but it made up for it in beauty. The glass paneling that stretched over a vast amount of the castle gleamed in the sunlight causing it to glitter and shine. Hermiones breath caught- she fought to find Ginnys hand again as she had dropped it in her surprise. She found it in the mess of bodies and clutched it, intertwining their fingers and squeezing tightly as the excitement overtook her.Large golden topped spires pointed to the sky and there were staircases on the outside that made the castle look like it was constantly moving and spiraling- like a beautiful dance. The gardens were perfectly manicured and neat hedges wound fantastic patterns into the grassed areas criss-crossing around the castle. Hermione didn’t think she had seen something so beautiful in her life- her face would have said it all. The elation and joy that she knew she was projecting would be enough to see how taken she was with Beauxbatons.She could feel Ginnys excitement as she squeezed her hand back- it grounded her back to life, small soft sweeps of her thumb ran across Hermiones hand and she was confused as to the gesture. Hermione looked down and saw a hand that was most certainly NOT GINNYS!A large hand grasped at hers as the thumb ran gently over hers- she looked up to the owner and nearly fell over. “Malfoy!” Hermione pulled her hand back quickly. “I thought you were Ginny” she said trying to reason her contact.“I know that Weasley plays a lot of Quidditch, but surely you can tell the difference between her hand and mine?” Hermione blushed as she scolded Malfoy.“Wait, you knew that it was me holding your hand though”. He froze. She could see the cogs turning in his head, trying to think of a reason that he didn’t pull away from her first. “I thought you might float away if I let go”. Lame excuse, but Hermione couldn’t help the flutter in her chest. The Headmistress cleared her throat- “Okay, now Welcome to Beauxbatons-” she straightened her robes like she had just been through a shady part of town and turned to begin their walk to the castle. Hermione decided to leave her conversation for later. She would get it out of him at some point- whatever ‘it’ was.Luna, Ginny and Padma caught up to Hermione and linked their arms. Ginny leant in to whisper into her ear. “Did I just see you and the little git holding hands?” Padma squealed with glee.“Well after the show in the carriage I would hardly call him ‘little’” Padma rebuted.“Fine! The big git then” Ginny said with a smirk on her face. Hermione dropped her head to hide her blush and the girls began giggling. “Right! When we get to our room you are spilling everything, and when I say everything- I mean everything!”Hermione was almost stunned at the ferocity in Ginnys voice, like Hermione was keeping some deep dark secret from her that she was desperate to find out. Maybe she was. 
   --------------------------------

   
What a fucking day! Draco was bloody exhausted- stripping in front of your entire year level will do that to a man. Not only that, he then had to save Granger from a honest to gods street rat before she was taken away and never heard from again- fucking Gryffindors will trust anyone!Then…. Then, she held his hand. It may have been an accident, but it was enough to shoot Dracos thought process to shit- his brain felt like it had a light fluffy cloud encasing it and his hand felt like it was on fire, sending heat up the entire side of his body.
  What in the ever living fuck is happening to me!
He quickly filtered his way through to the back of the group to settle next to Theo. “I need help…” he said low enough so Blaise couldn’t hear him.“Uh mate, we have always known that…” Theo joked with him. Draco shot him a look of contempt. Theo sighed- “what do you need…” resigned to the fact that he would no doubt be caught up in whatever was about to come out of Dracos mouth.“Not now, I just- I need to talk”.Theo stepped back and the shock expressed from his face made Draco wince. “Talk?... well this is new”.Draco nodded and Theo did the same and they made a non-verbal agreement to meet up later to… talk…--Beauxbatons Academy of Magic was just as decorated and delicate up close. They reached the main entrance and were greeted by the staff and students who collectively sung choruses that echoed through to the mountains and far beyond. It sounded like a beautiful symphony was playing just for them. Draco had never before seen so much gold leafing before and his Manor was filled with it.The crest of Beauxbatons was hung proudly atop the entry doors and sported delicate gold vines twisting around a jade plaque- the large letter ‘B’ adorned the jade and looked as though it was almost being swallowed by the vines. On closer look- Draco realized that the vines in fact had thorns- the plaque was being overtaken as a show of power and strength. He drew a sharp breath as he realized how much a single crest could portray.They entered through to their version of the ‘Great Hall’- there was no separation of houses, no individual colors- everything was light and bright. There was no need for house unity as their entire school was already united as one. There were large tables set for anyone to sit wherever they pleased and from what he could see each student would mingle with those that decided to sit closest, whether they were friends or not.McGonagall instructed the students to sit at a table and begin their meals while she retreated to the professors near the end of the hall.Draco walked with Blaise and Theo through the hall and noticed that Finnigan and Thomas has tacked onto the end of their group, slightly unsteady on their feet still- at least the Slytherins could hold their drink. They all sat at a table and were immediately greeted by a flurry of Beauxbatons girls dressed in tiny pale blue dresses, they almost looked like tutus. Draco looked towards Blaise who seemed as though he was about to explode with the attention he was receiving.Theo however was not even interested in the horde of women surrounding them. The two Gryffindors were just as entertained as Blaise. This might be his moment. He might not get another. He moved to the chair next to Theo and spoke in hushed tones. Theo was the first to speak.“Tell me what’s going on”.Draco looked down at his hands- “I don’t know… I guess, it’s kind of hard… it’s just-”Theo cut him off. “Yes, yes, you don’t know what’s happening to you , you guess you don’t really know how to talk about your feelings with anyone which makes it kind of hard to figure things out-”Draco was the one to cut him off this time- “I just need help… Theo- if you could help me”.Theo smiled at his friend, a soft smile- knowing already what he wanted, what he needed and how he could get it. Theo had quite a gift in fact, always a step ahead, always scheming and always ending on top- it’s why he was sorted to Slytherin after all.“You like her don’t you”.Draco didn’t pause. “Yes”.“What’s stopping you then?” Theo already knew his answer but asked anyway.“I was a Death Eater, and her childhood bully- she deserves someone better than me” Draco looked like he had stabbed himself in the stomach and decided that he would just die a slow and painful death because that’s what he deserved in life.“Shouldn’t that be for her to decide?”“There are so many reasons why this couldn’t work”.Theo stared at him intently- “and only one reason why it will work…” they both cringed at the word that came next- “love”.Blaise looked over for a moment to see what his friends were doing and why they weren’t joining in but his attention was quickly stolen away by a young blonde witch.“Will you help me?” Draco asked Theo.“Of course mate- wouldn’t miss this, I’ve only been waiting seven years for it” he grinned cheekily at Draco.Blaise moved over to the boys and they fell silent. He glared at them as if he knew they were keeping secrets. “So…. Drake- when are we doing this then?”“Doing what exactly?”“Getting you the girl” Blaise winked at them and Theo laughed.“Was it that fucking obvious…” Draco clapped his hand against his forehead. As Blaise straightened up knowing he had cracked their secret squirrel code.“Not obvious mate- I just knew that if I gave her a kiss it would give you the kick up the arse you needed to finally admit that you like her”. Draco stood with his mouth hanging wide open. No fucking way did Blaise Zabini out Slytherin the Slytherin Prince….------------------------------------- They were shown to their dorm rooms and Hermione opened her trunk to get the few nostalgic things she liked to scatter around her room at Hogwarts out to do the same here. A photo of her parents with Crooks, the Christmas at the Weasleys photo with Harry and Ron, a delicate silver necklace with tiny flowers that her mother gave her before she left for Hogwarts, two sets of ornate quills and about thirty of her favorite books (shrunk down of course).She had to leave Crooks with one of the professors when she left for France, she knew that he would be in good hands but it didn’t stop her from missing her familiar. She could really use him right now. Padma had already unpacked her things and Luna sat cross-legged on her bed reading the Quibbler as Hermione heard a knocking at the door. Ginny bound in before anyone had even answered and Hermione called out- “let me guess, McGonagall?”Ginny smirked wickedly at Hermione and spelled her trunk in after her, barreling across the room it almost took out a large delicate mirror on the wall. The trunk clunked down on the ground in front of the final bed and Ginny sat down on the mattress.“Ok, I can’t wait any longer- spill!”“Gin, I haven’t even unpacked yet. Also I don’t even know what’s happening, if there even is anything”.Ginny gave her a quick scoff- “As if there isn’t, have you seen the way he looks at you Hermione. He is practically begging you to take him somewhere secluded and shag him proper”. Padma ran from her side of the room and jumped onto Ginnys bed not wanting to miss any part of this amazing gossip and Luna put down her paper.Hermione laughed. “I wouldn’t say he was begging to be shagged Ginny. I just have no idea what’s going on in that head of his- he is so reserved”. Ginny wandered over to Hermione and put her hand on her shoulder as they sunk to the bed below. “He has spent the last year with a dark wizard living in his house, torturing him, he has grown up with pureblood parents who don’t show emotion, up until a few months ago he believed that all muggle-borns were less-than. He has come a bloody long way and he has done it all on his own. There was probably no room for him to be open and honest in his life up until now”.Hermione recoiled, she couldn’t believe the things that Malfoy had gone through, she could understand why he was the way he was. She just didn’t know if that would be enough though for her.“What do I do?”“Don’t worry, we’ll help”. Ginny nodded reassuringly and turned to Padma and Luna who mirrored her declaration.
  
    Chapter Text
    The next day Durmstrang arrived, their students donned large woolen cloaks and all looked as though they were stocking up for the winter with how bulky each student seemed. Draco knew that Durmstrang would be their biggest rivals in the Triwizard Tournament. He had debated on and off ever since Theo had told him of the plans for a re-do whether to enter or not.
This was his chance to clear his family name in the halls of Hogwarts, maybe not completely clear-
Draco knew that in the end he would do just about anything to try and save his name, even if it meant he would die trying. He was in the peak of his physical state and knew that this was one of his only chances. His lips hardened into thin lines as the boys from Durmstrang walked into the ‘Great Hall’- they, unlike Draco had not yet given up their pureblood ideologies, their thoughts on muggle-borns was almost as bad as Voldemorts was- even after their old Headmaster was killed.
There would be no way that he would let them win should he have the chance to represent Hogwarts.
His anger was short lived as he spied a beautiful girl gliding into the room after the crowd- her curled hair bouncing wildly with every step. Every day she looked absolutely perfect without trying- he would have to tell her that one day.
Hermione stopped at his table and sat down next to Theo and Ginny who were surprisingly close- had his closest friend found himself a girlfriend without him even knowing about it? He would need to find out next time he spoke to Theo alone. 
Theo laughed at something Hermione had said and it brought Draco back to reality. “apparently one of the Durmstrang boys tried to hit on Hermione then found out she was muggle-born and fell over a hedge as he was trying to make a hasty retreat” Theo barked out a laugh. Draco almost growled, he had to stop doing that- he wasn’t an animal!
Hermione flushed, clearly embarrassed by the notion of someone hitting on her and then running away. Draco realized that she probably didn’t see herself as pretty, someone who was sought after, coveted. He would try and change that.
Longbottom sat down heavily at the table with a clunk- he slung a bag on top of his empty plate and started pulling pamphlets from it. Hermiones face lit up at the site of the literature- typical. 
“I think if we start at the Arc De Triumph around ten we can make it to the Louvre by lunch” Longbottom said in Hermiones direction, she nodded and a plan was made between the two.
Draco hadn’t been quick enough, he missed his chance to ask her somewhere today- to spend some time with him. Theo piped up- “Oh, are you two going to the Louvre? I have always wanted to go there!” Blaise retorted- “Theo we went there with my mu-” he was quickly silenced by a swift kick under the table by an unknown source.
Ginny and Luna both chimed in “I would love to go too”. Theo suggested they all go as a group outing and Dracos chest lightened slightly. Theo leant over to Draco- “you owe me”. Draco realized that Theo had gotten them all invited so that he could spend some time with Granger. He swiftly nodded.
--
Their first stop was definitely not impressive, apart from it being a very large round-about (whatever that was), it was just predominantly loud, busy and an accident waiting to happen. Luna almost walked out in front of a car and Blaise pulled her to safety just in time. They took their time walking to The Louvre, passing by markets and quaint little French bakeries- Grangers eyes lit up as she spied someone with a lusciously buttery croissant.
Draco didn’t approach her during their exploring, he more just watched her. Everything she did was composed, educated and well thought out. She hardly stepped a foot out of line, only if she thought something was wrong. She was highly respectful- mainly towards art and history but people in general also.
After they had walked through the exit of the Louvre Hermione walked behind the group and Draco hung back- Longbottom turned towards her and began a conversation that was quickly cut short by Theo and Blaise asking him countless questions about the Mona Lisa- the one artwork they could remember enough to ask about. Draco would definitely owe them for today.
She looked sad for some reason. He walked to her side and silently accompanied her for what seemed like a long time. Waiting for her to speak if she wanted to.
“I was meant to come here with my parents” she said quietly.
Draco wasn’t sure what she meant- he hadn’t been privy to her private life up until now. “You still could I’m sure?”
She looked off to the nearby river and Draco slightly altered his steps and direction to move her towards the river side.
“My parents are in Australia, I had to obliviate them when the war ran through Britain- I had no other choice in keeping them safe”. Draco couldn’t believe what she was telling him. He didn’t even like his parents sometimes and he would still care if they didn’t know who he was.
“I’m sorry” was all he could muster- what else was there to say?
They had made it to the river and instead of walking she had stopped. Looking out over the glittering water she drew a heavy breath. “I just miss them a lot when big things happen that they are not a part of”.
Draco wasn’t good at this kind of thing, his abilities in the emotional side of life were extremely limited to say the least- he looked around awkwardly trying to figure out what to say to her. She looked at him- her eyes soft and sweet, she was hurting though.
---------------------------------------
 
Draco stood silently beside her on the banks of the Seine River- she knew she was pushing his boundaries big time with this. She didn’t think that he had probably ever had a moment in his life that felt so vulnerable, and it wasn’t even him that was sharing.
Maybe she had pushed him too far? He had been awfully quiet for a while now.
Suddenly he moved without warning, a quick few paces and he was talking to someone… talking… in French?  
“Puis-je acheter une fleur pour la beauté là-bas s’il vous plaît”.
Hermiones jaw hit the ground, since when could Draco Malfoy speak French- and fluently? He pointed to something, selecting it and handed the man some money, walking back over with the item behind his back.
“Close your eyes Granger”.
Hermiones breath hitched. Was she really going to just trust him blindly and shut her eyes to complete vulnerability? Yes.
 Draco didn’t even have to ask her twice, he didn’t have to ask her if she trusts him, she could just feel it now- she did. She slowly closed her eyes and waited, what did he have behind his back?
Her senses kicked in as a sweet scent enveloped her system- a carefully selected flower. He told her to open and she was met with the most vibrant pink Peony she had ever seen. Fully blossomed it sent her mind whirling at the beauty and intrigue- not just from the flower, from the man standing before her offering something more than a flower- he offered her emotion and vulnerability which he had possibly never done before.
Hermione took the flower from him- “Thank you Malf... Draco...” she quirked her eyebrow “I never knew you could speak French”. He smiled at her. “That was… very sweet” she was trying to tread lightly. Not knowing where exactly they stood and what his feelings were for her- if there were any.
 “C'était la fleur que mon père a donnée à ma mère le jour où il lui a demandé” he said to her sweetly.
“What does that mean?”
“I’ll tell you one day Granger. We better catch up to the others before they head back”. He cut her off before she had time to debate her French lesson- what was it? Something about a flower, a père- father and a mère- mother. The rest she would need to look up later.
They walked side by side along the river a while longer, they had caught up to their friends and only Theo, Blaise and Ginny had noticed their absence. Ginny was practically vibrating from anticipation at hearing the outcome to their little ploy. The girls would wander ahead drawing the group away as Hermione stayed back hoping that he would take the chance and stay with her.

  It had been a smashing success if she did say so herself. 

-------------------------------
Puis-je acheter une fleur pour la beauté là-bas s'il vous plait- Can I buy a flower for the beauty over there please.
C'était la fleur que mon père a donnée à ma mère le jour où il lui a demandé- This is the flower that my father gave my mother the day he asked her to be his.

   

  
    Chapter Text
    McGonagall called for a Hogwarts meeting with all students and staff. They gathered shortly after Hermione and the others returned to Beauxbatons- Hermione only had time to run to her dorm and deposit the Peony in some water and cast a long lasting charm on it before running back out the door again.“The champions will be chosen in two days- until then, if you plan to compete you must add your name to the Triwizard cup. Hermione heard Ginny gulp next to her and she could tell she was nervous. She glanced down intending to grab hold of Ginnys hand and she saw another site that had shocked her for the day. Theo Nott was ghosting across Ginnys fingers with his knuckles. Not quite committing to holding her hand but enough for her to know that he was there.Hermione smiled to herself and quickly looked away to give them the time together, they had after all allowed her the same earlier.“Another thing, we will be continuing with tradition and Beauxbatons will be hosting a Yule Ball- Hermione sighed, not another sodding ball. Padma and Luna smiled at each other excitedly as they imagined their beautiful night at a ball in France.She still had a sour taste in her mouth from the last evening, spent crying over Ronald. Fat chance she was letting that happen again, no- she wouldn’t go. She would just stay up in her room all night and read a good book.McGonagall called attention to herself once more after the excitement of the announcement. “Finally, please remember that if you are visiting parts of muggle Paris that you must not use your magic- Mister Thomas has now been disqualified from entering the tournament due to muggle exposure and the need to obliviate numerous parties”. She glared at the boy who winced at being mentioned. They were dismissed and the students returned to their dorms to clean up for dinner.Hermione pulled out her French to English text that she had stowed away in her trunk and began flicking through the pages. Ginny approached her bed and sat down with as little grace as possible- spilling Hermiones parchment over the side of her bed.“What ya’ doing?”she questioned teasingly.“Malfoy can speak French” she looked at her friend with a cheeky smile.“Uh, so.. you want to learn French to be able to whisper sweet nothings in his ear?” Hermione laughed. “Ok, not sweet nothings then” Ginny said as she looked around the room making sure Padma and Luna were not there. “You want to tell him all the dirty and ravenous things you want to do to him while you fuck endlessly under the moonlight in the vinyards?... In French” she added to drive home her point.Hermione slapped her on the arm and scoffed. “Ginny! You are foul. Please don’t bring me into your secret desires for Theodore Nott”. Ginny went red.“I... what? How did you know that we had been talking…?”Hermione laughed- “you two are about as subtle as sledge hammers. Plus the ridiculous snog session you shared in front of the entire 8th year class kind of gave it away… Ginny, you know I’m happy for you right?”Ginny smiled- Hermione continued. “Just be sure about it. I know that you and Harry… well you didn’t quite get that far, but just be sure that it’s something you want to do before you get to that situation”. Hermione placed her hand on Ginnys shoulder in comfort.“I think he is really sweet. I can’t believe we came to Paris to find love and it ended up being with Hogwarts guys”. Hermione stiffened at the ‘L’ word- she wasn’t that far down the rabbit hole. She retreated quickly to the shared bathroom and sunk into a hot bath to calm her mind. She was definitely thinking too far into this, maybe a Paris romance, a fling of sorts… it couldn’t be love. Could it?The way that Draco looked at her though- it sent shivers all over her body. His silver gaze enveloped her, every sultry word he said reverberating around her mind- developing a heat deep within her. His muscular driven body that did things to her thoughts. What would it be like to be under him? His muscles tensing as he collected her up in his arms and drove into her so hard that she screamed out his name over and over. Hermione reached down to run her hand slowly across her breasts, skimming her nipples as they hardened under the water. Hips colliding as his hand presses her thigh higher up his hip to angle further into her. Her finger slid across her hips, imagining it was his slender hand caressing her softly. Slowly making her way across her clit and into her core as she gasped with the contact. “Fuck” she whispered softly as she moaned quietly.
  Her face burying into his neck stifling a moan as he forced down against her, the weight of his body pressed firmly in place and sliding up and down as he pushed her further and closer to the edge.
Hermione pumped her fingers into her core as her thumb grazed against her clit. She was gasping for air as she worked herself up further.
  Silver eyes piercing into hers as he reached up licking his fingers and diving them between their bodies as he grazed her clit. She bucked at the contact and bit into his neck forcing him into a frantic pace. They both came together in an explosion of energy and heat- gasping, grabbing, sweating- 
Hermione moaned as she finished clutching around her fingers and released her sensitive clit- the last moments of her orgasm rolling through her, but ultimately leaving her far from satisfied…She sunk into the bath fully allowing the water to surround her as she thought of only one thing- Draco fucking Malfoy.------------------------------------------- The excitement was electric as the cup was revealed in the Grand entrance to Beauxbatons- the electric blue cascaded off the walls and the humming of magic brought a shiver to everyone in the room.The Hogwarts boys stood watching as a few of the Beauxbatons champion hopefuls dropped their names into the cup with a whirl of flames- next were at least ten of the boys from Durmstang. Each high-fiving as they had completed the only task that Draco thought their tiny brains could handle at once.Theo nudged his arm- “Have you made up your mind?”Draco nodded silently- answering his question. He had written his name in slanting scrawl on a piece of crisp parchment. Feeling as though he needed all the luck he could get; he thought about why he wanted to enter… for redemption? Family honor? To impress someone who had recently become very important to him?... maybe for each of those reasons- he drew a tiny heart in the corner of his parchment and folded it in half. “for luck”- he said quietly as he thought about the beautiful brunette who had captured his attentions.Finnigan walked to the cup and placed his name in with a wink at a nearby Beauxbatons girl- she giggled and blushed waving at him keenly. Draco clutched at the parchment and walked the length of the entrance hall to the cup. He could hear the quiet whispers and felt the eyes following him in his objective. No matter the country he was still well known throughout the wizarding world- never truly being able to get away from his past.
  Was this the right thing to do? He didn’t know- but he was going to give it a red hot go anyway. 
He stopped for a moment as he reached the shining blue, second guessing his decision. He could die in the tournament, he was always about self-preservation. Could he be the hero in this story?Draco saw a shuffling ahead of him and his attention was taken for a second as he gazed up into the sweet honey eyes that watched him intently. She gave him a small nod and a heart stopping smile. He didn’t need anything else- dropping his parchment into the cup and backing away from the flames he rounded the podium and walked towards his muse.“Fancy a walk Granger. It seems to be a bit crowded in here”.Hermione laughed as he offered her his arm to take. She didn’t hesitate and slid her hand through to rest on his forearm. A jolt of electricity ran up his arm into his chest- this was where she belonged, by his side- holding him as he guided her through the aftermath of war.  They walked to the towering doorway and Draco held the door open for her as she glided through with a sweet smile.The sky was hued with deep golds and pinks as the sun set in the distant horizon- the backdrop for the perfect evening. Once outside and down the steps they walked to the entrance of a small rose garden that wound its way across the grounds- it bloomed spectacularly in the light as they drew closer.Draco crowded in closer to move through the archway and their shoulders brushed- “I thought that you might like a stroll before dinner” he said, not knowing how else to break the silence.“Oh, yes- it is quite lovely out here”. This felt forced. Draco leaned over and grabbed at a rose in the garden wall- he held it in his hand and pulled his wand waving it across the thorns and petals. A beautiful mix of pink and purple drowned the petals and it transformed into a Peony similar to the other only a different color.He handed the blossoming flower to Hermione and she blushed. “Much better” she said as she took the flower and sniffed its luscious scent. Draco grinned at her as he watched the ease pass over- “They are my mothers favorite” he said matter-of-factly.Hermione carried the flower with her as they walked further, talking about their interests, Hogwarts, their families, even Quidditch much to Hermiones dismay. As they grew more comfortable with each other they opened up to discuss things about their futures, what they hoped for in life, everything really…The sun had disappeared behind the hills and had been replaced by the moon taking prominent position in the sky- if Draco had to guess he thought it would be well and truly close to midnight. They had skipped dinner to continue talking and walking and they had wandered the grounds close to the castle almost four times now. On the third Draco had plucked up the nerve and reached for her hand- she hadn’t stopped him.Their last round had been slow- each knowing that this would be the last before they said goodnight, he hadn’t wanted to let go of her hand. They reached the steps leading up to the door and Draco paused. “Thank you, for tonight- well really, for everything”. Draco said quietly to Hermione. She looked at him puzzled- “Everything?”He had come this far- they had talked so openly tonight, he had to tell her.“For giving me a chance.. To be a better person and not be defined by my past. I know that I have made a lot of bad choices in my life, I know what I have done- nothing I can say will ever change that but I want to try anyway- even if it’s never enough, it’s still something I need to do”.Draco looked down at his shoes and scuffing his feet along the ground- he ran his hand up through his hair and it dropped over his forehead before he looked up again to catch her eyes wondrously gazing at him. “Hermione, I’m sorry- for all of the things that I have done to you, all the terrible things I have said… you never deserved any of it. I was a coward, I always took the easy way out and I don’t want to do that anymore. I want to be someone who is courageous, someone who people want to know, a man that is good enough to be with the ‘brightest witch of our age’”. He stopped, not knowing if he had said too much, given too much away- “I was a bad person, I don’t deserve anything good in life- but you seem to want to still give me a chance at some kind of happiness and for that I… I just can’t describe how much it means to me”.Hermione reached up and placed her hand over his cheek guiding his face up to meet her eyes- “You can be whoever you choose to be Draco-” She pressed up onto her toes and whispered in his ear- “I forgive you... Goodnight” as she pressed a gentle kiss to his cheek.She turned to walk up the steps and Draco grabbed her hand pulling her back towards him. He caught her waist and let go of her wrist winding his fingers through her curls as he crashed his lips against hers- she gasped at the touch and gave in to him. Hermione wound her hands up his chest and around his neck, she tilted forward and coaxed his tongue out to slide gently across hers. He never thought something could feel this good- this moment- this connection. It was nothing like he had had before. He broke away as they both caught their breath and a beautiful smile broke out across her face as he played with one of her curls- “Goodnight Draco” she said sweetly.“Goodnight Hermione”. He grinned at her and let his grasp around her go as he stood in place and she walked back up the stairs through the doorway- like he was seeing her home after a first date.His heart was thrumming, his body warm- every inch of him was positively beaming at the idea that Hermione Granger had just kissed him in the moonlight of a warm Paris night.
  
    Chapter Text
    Luna was awake when Hermione walked through the door to their dorm- she looked up over a magazine and smiled knowingly. “How was Draco?” Hermione was beaming, she couldn’t contain herself- she walked to the vase that contained the first Peony and placed the second in casting the same lasting charm onto the new flower.Slinking over to the other side of the room Hermione went to sit at the end of Lunas bed. “he’s… nothing like what I expected…”“Yes he has changed a lot since the war” Luna stated- “the Wibbler-wrens are even starting to hang around him which is nice”.Hermione wasn’t sure what to make of that one, she obviously portrayed her confusion a bit too much and Luna answered her unspoken question. “Well he is in love of course. Wibbler-wrens don’t hang around just any person after all”.Hermiones breath caught as she heard that ‘L’ word again- “L…love?” was all she could force out.“Yes- and from what I can see, quite deeply- almost the same amount that are around you” Luna said.Hermione coughed and tried to steady herself. She blushed furiously as her friend pointed out something that had been creeping into Hermiones mind since their walk along the river. Was she in  love with Draco fucking Malfoy!?She got up from Lunas bed and walked over to hers- “well thanks Luna, must get some sleep now. Big day tomorrow”. Hermione got under the covers and she heard a small whisper from the other side of the room as Luna spoke to (what she could only guess were) the Wibbler-wrens- “don’t worry, they will come around soon- it’s fate”.--The next day saw more entries into the tournament- Ginny had jumped up after breakfast and deposited her parchment, the flood of courage sent her running across the hall to where the group were sitting and launching herself into Theos arms as they kissed passionately over their breakfast. Blaise looked like he was going to faint into his plate of eggs and bacon. “Why am I only finding out about this now?” he screeched before he righted himself, placing the walls of his male bravado up once again. “Uh well, more Beauxbatons girls for me”. Blaise winked at Theo and turned to the table next to them to strike up a conversation with a pretty little red-head who had been eyeing him off all morning.Hermione giggled and she felt a hand place gently on her shoulder. Draco sat down next to her and leant over to whisper in her ear- “fancy a tour of Paris today from someone who doesn’t need a ‘tourists guide to France’ book to know all the best places?” Draco pointed his fork over to the other side of the table and Hermione let out a loud laugh as Neville sat with his head in the very book Draco had mentioned. “Oh, I don’t know- Neville does look like he knows a great deal about the sites, plus- I am a very sought after witch. You may have to line up” Hermione joked quietly to him.Draco smirked- what was he planning? He leaned in closer and reached under the table to place his hand softly against her thigh above her knee. Hermione took in a sharp breath and his smirk widened. Fuck, she just gave herself away. His mouth was inches from the shell of her ear, his voice as low and seductive so no one else could hear- his hand slowly gliding higher up her thigh eliciting a trail of goosebumps in its wake “I really don’t think Longbottom could make you feel the way that I do...” Hermiones eyes fluttered and her heart rate increased. She could feel heat washing over her as she thought of all the things that Draco could do to her to make her ‘feel’. His hand continued up- closer to its destination, she tried her hardest to stifle a moan and a small whimper came out barely audible.“So, is that a yes then?” Draco asked quietly- Hermione nodded quickly. “Good girl” he said and she moaned. Theo turned in his seat at the sound- a questioning smirk on his face and Draco dropped his hand away. She objected to the release of his hand but knew that this was definitely not the time or place.The rest of breakfast passed without overt displays of affection and discrete displays of seduction, much to Hermiones dismay.They walked from the hall and Hermione set a time to meet him in the entry way so that she could change for their day out. Once back in the dorm Ginny pounced on her like she was a fancy doll to dress up- Padma who was the make-up and hair specialist of the group arrived and Luna was given the extremely important task of shooing away the Wibbler-wrens because none of the girls trusted her fashion sense. “I don’t know why you want me to shoo them away Hermione-” Luna said. “They will just come back when you are around him next- besides they are particularly friendly and their wings sparkle in the light”. Hermione didn’t even know what to say to that so she just let Ginny filter her answers.Working furiously for about forty-five minutes and then Ginny finally choosing the perfect dress that she slightly transfigured Hermione was finally ready for her first ‘date?’ with Draco.
  Where was he going to take her? What would they end up doing together? The possibilities were endless.
She descended the steps to the front doors at ten and found him waiting at the bottom with a strikingly blue Peony in his hands. He was dressed in muggle clothing with a crisp dark sweater and grey slacks. His shoulders shown off with the tight tapered material- his hair was pushed back and looked silky. He wasn’t the boy that she knew from her childhood at Hogwarts, he was a man that she had come to know over the last few weeks. His taught, hollow face had rounded out slightly with the stress of the war no-longer on his shoulders and his features had softened. Draco Malfoy was by far the most handsome man she had seen in a very long time.His smile beamed as he watched her walk down the stairs and he held out his arm for her to take, just as she had the night before.Walking to the gate on the outskirts they were able to apparate once the wards had cleared and Hermione held on as Draco took them to their first destination. They landed with a gentle thud on the ground near a river, Hermione thought that maybe it was the same that they had walked along when they first talked. Draco let go of her arm and took her hand in his. His long slender fingers incased hers and sent shivers up her spine- his skin brightened by the sunlight as they walked slowly along the riverside.“You did promise ‘all the best places’” Hermione chuckled as they continued to walk in silence. “We haven’t gotten to our first site yet, patience love”. Hermiones knees almost buckled- that word coming from his mouth was enough to make her whimper. God she was like a horny teenager… oh wait she was…They continued along and Hermione saw in the distance a large spanning bridge that glittered in the sunlight. Draco helped her up to the walkway and they began crossing the bridge- “The Pont des Arts-” he said, “the love lock bridge”. Hermione took in the site all around her, pairs of people standing together all across the bridge which was littered either side with any and all kinds of locks- big and small, colorful and plain- each with the same thing on them, the initials of the people placing it there.“It’s beautiful” she whispered as the site took her breath away.“So much hate in the world, I wanted to bring you somewhere that encompassed love”. Draco reached into his pocket and pulled out a gold padlock- “For your parents, so that they can be here with you too”. Hermione stared at the lock and tears brimmed and pricked her eyes as she tried to hold them back. This man, he was the most amazing person- A small trail forming down her cheek that he noticed- he pulled her in close and she buried her face into his chest as she sobbed quietly. He curved his arms around her protectively and held her tight until she had calmed. Hermione pulled out her wand and shielded herself between Draco and the bridge edge as she muttered a spell- small scrawling letters appeared over the lock and she fastened it to the fence line throwing the key into the Seine River as was custom Draco told her. She ran her hands over the letters of her parents names and thought fondly of them and this place. Draco turned to walk away holding his hand out for Hermione to take.Hermione stilled. He looked at her confused. She turned on her heel and walked to the vendor across the bridge and came back with a second lock in her hands.
  Was she getting one for the Golden Trio?
Hermione walked back towards the fence and held out her hand to Draco. The ornate silver lock had green edges and Draco started to laugh- Slytherin colors. She lifted her wand once more and cast a barely audible spell- beautiful script wound across the pale silver covering and the letters D.M & H.G appeared. She smiled at him as his heart pounded against his chest- she was beautiful, she was intelligent, she was everything that he could ever hope for in his sad and miserable life and she was offering him… what? Love? He couldn’t help his mind running away with the thought of the future that they could share together.The lock was softly pressed into his palm and Hermione turned towards the fence, he looped the top through the edging and it clicked closed with ease- “Make a wish” she said as she smiled at him and then she cast the key as far as she could into the water below. Anything he could wish for was standing in front of him right in that moment. -- They stayed at the bridge for a while longer, looking over the glistening water and watching the couples exchange vows of love and adoration to one another- Hermione explained to Draco the custom of proposing in the Muggle world as they had seen two in the span of half an hour.“Every generation of my family has been arranged- there is no grand proposal, just a contract to sign” he said sadly. She explained the meaning behind it and the love that went with it- they stood still watching until they saw another happen right next to them, the woman cried and the man picked her up in a hurried excitement when she cried out ‘yes!’. Draco was beaming- he didn’t know why.They began walking again and once out of site Draco apparated them to their next destination. It was an alleyway that they next dropped into. Hermione looked around confused as he pulled her further into the confines of brick walls. There was a small gate at the end that was well covered and hidden by bins and posters- the dingey walls surrounding them were enough to turn any person away without knowing what lay beyond those gates.He clutched to her hand and propelled them further towards the entry way, the delicate gate had been disillusioned to send any muggle in the opposite direction. Hermione was apprehensive, he could tell- she pulled back slightly not knowing what he was taking her into. He pushed at the wrought iron that swirled symmetrical on top of the gate and the hinges squealed in anger at being disturbed. It wasn’t until they crossed the threshold that a hidden garden materialized and enveloped them in its beauty. Hermione clutched tightly at his hand as her eyes blew wide with wonder- they sparkled as she took in the lush green overgrown plants cascaded down overhead and along the walls. A clear path lead them forward and through to a clearing that was darkened by the lack of sunlight coming through- they were greeted by tiny twinkling lights strung haphazardly about overhead that bathed the clearing in sweet gentle light. Draco walked Hermione over to a small table set in the middle with two chairs, he pulled the first chair out for her to sit in and then took his seat across from her. “I thought this might be a nice place for some French delicacies”. Hermione wasn’t even paying attention, she was still looking about the tree line, taking in all there was to see- breathtaking.As if she came to, she asked him to repeat himself. “Are you hungry?” She nodded. “When you say delicacies… you don’t mean frogs legs or anything” she scrunched up her nose and Draco chuckled.“No, something that I think you will appreciate more”. The plates materialized before them- a large beautifully buttery croissant appeared sitting in the middle and a number of different types of perfectly fresh fruit paired the pastry. Hermiones eyes widened and she smiled- “you saw me the other day looking over to the bakery didn’t you?” Draco gave her a quick smirk before he picked up his pastry and brought it to his mouth. He didn’t realize how difficult it would be to eat a croissant with elegance. She took one bite into hers and she moaned sensually at the flavor, Dracos pulse quickened at the sound- he had to control himself-she was just eating food for fucks sake.Her lush pouty lips wrapped around the end of a strawberry and he licked his lips watching her, thinking of all the things that she could do with that perfect set of lips… how amazing they felt against his the night before. Merlin he wanted to kiss her again. Draco must have been staring, she started to blush and giggled at his attention. What had he done right in life to hold the affections of this enchanting witch? “Do you want to kiss me Draco?” Hermione said across the table as she licked the last of the sweet berry from her lips and his gaze fell to its original position.His throat constricted, his pulse quickened and all he could muster was a slight nod before he leant forward and cupped the back of her neck pulling her into him. Their lips collided as if they had wanted this for so long and couldn’t wait a moment longer. Hermione ran her hand up through his hair and he let out a soft groan- his other hand wound behind her and pulled at her waist until she was moving her whole body towards him. She sat straddling the chair and Dracos lap as they deepened their exploration. His tongue swept lightly through her mouth playing tantalizingly with hers as his hand pressed firmly against her lower back pushing her closer into him. Hermiones tangled curls fell across their faces as she began moving slowly grinding against him as he sat still trying not to move- afraid any movement would stop her actions.She pressed her hand softly against his jaw and began running her lips and tongue along his neck and up to his ear, he shuddered at her attention and she felt what she was doing to him. He shifted slightly trying not to let on that he was growing increasingly hard by her grinding and kissing. She had a moment of courage and grabbed at Dracos hands- placing one firmly against her hip and the other cupping her breast. Draco lost all self-control, he grasped firmly at her hip and increased her movements against him- shifting his thigh to put pressure against her core as she gave a loud moan into the canopy of the forest. His other hand aided her increased pressure as he rolled his thumb over the tight peaks of her nipples that had pebbled under the material of her top.He was ravenous, he needed to stop now or he wouldn’t be able to help himself if they went any further.  Draco grabbed at her tumbling hair and pulled her in for a searing kiss, he slowly ebbed back and softened- he stilled her hips and tried to settle her. “I… I can’t.” He said softly, breathing against her lips. “I want to… god do I want to fuck you so badly right now, on this very garden floor. But we can’t, not now”. He heard Hermione whimper and she pouted slightly. “What’s wrong Draco?”“I can’t tell you just yet- but I promise I will soon. Besides, we have one more stop before we need to be back at the castle for dinner-” Hermione looked on the verge of throwing caution to the wind and just pushing him down on the ground right there and taking him but she didn’t know what his reasons were for not wanting to so she let it go. She climbed off him and they walked to the garden entrance together hand in hand. She stopped before the gate and turned to him. “This was beautiful- thank you”. He smiled and leant down to give her a gentle kiss before they left their secret garden and ventured back into the real world.
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione stepped through the gate and felt as though a piece of her was left behind as the alleyway came back into site and hers and Dracos secret garden was left behind in the shadows. She wasn’t even sure what had happened in the clearing, she knew what was about to happen- but not why it didn’t…
Before she could consider that possibilities she was apparated away and into a street completely full of people, marquise and food- they were at a French market, hustle and bustle ran around them as she held on tightly to his arm. No one had noticed their apperation because of the amount of people present. Was this where he meant to bring her? He walked her through the stalls and past the merchants to a quieter part of the market- a long drawn shawl hung across a long wooden frame and Draco discretely pulled out his wand and muttered a few words into the fabric. He grabbed hold of Hermione tightly around her waist and they stepped through the fabric and into a similar market on the other side- this side however was filled with witches and wizards purchasing magical items, potions and different animals (Hermione thought were probably familiars).
Her mind was racing, this was perfect- a real look into the wizarding life in Paris- like Diagon Alley but the French version. She wandered along to each different stall taking in the surroundings and what was on offer to purchase. She picked out a few things to take back to the castle with her; a small vial of straightening potion for her hair, a book on magical creatures found in France, a bookmark that she would give to Ginny that allowed the reader to connect with another that was reading the same book for progress and summary. Ginny had told her that she had recently taken up reading the same books as her mother so that they could discuss them at length whenever they saw each other.
She turned and found Draco wasn’t behind her- her heart stopped for a moment as she searched the crowd. She spotted his tall figure and distinctive blonde hair in the flurry of people and made her way over to him. He had a small pouch that he quickly tucked into his pocket as she approached. “What are you hiding?” She said cheekily. He grinned- “It wouldn’t be a surprise if I gave it to you now”. A flutter erupted in her chest and she looked over his cheeky boyish features that once tormented her but now… now they made her heart pound raggedly in her chest, she was falling for him and there was nothing she could do to stop it- nor did she want to.
After eating some ‘street food’ they apparated back to the gate outside of Beauxbatons and crossed the barrier into the school grounds.

They climbed the steps together and stopped again at the front door- what was it with Draco and saying goodbye like he was dropping her at her house after a date? He pulled the small electric blue Peony from his back pocket where he was holding it for her and placed it into her hand. “This one is special, it just needs a little water”. He smiled at her as she kissed him on the cheek and went through the door.
Hermione walked back to her dorm in a daze, she couldn’t have told you which way was up and which way was down. Draco had completely turned her on her head and she was falling without reservations into something she felt was absolutely right. She entered the room and walked to the table with her vase on it depositing the flower in water- what did he say? It’s special, ‘it just needs a little water’.
Too tired from the days events and already content with her food from the market she skipped dinner and got straight into her bed. Tomorrow would be the Champions announcement and she didn’t really know how she felt about it- did she even want someone she cared for be chosen? She had seen what it did to Harry, what if it was just as bad- or worse? She thought about Ginny being swept up in the excitement and what she would do if Ginny had to compete. She thought about Seamus and whether he would have a chance at winning seen as he was mostly braun and not a terribly smart man. She thought of Draco- what if he was chosen? Could she stand to watch him compete, be put in danger for the sake of school pride? Her heart sunk as she wallowed in the possibilities and outcomes.
She thought for a long time, finally exhausted by her anxiety she dozed off and didn’t wake again until morning.
As she slid off her bed and began getting ready for breakfast she noticed that the small budding flower had opened in the night- she went to smell the fragrant aroma and was met with a shining silver bracelet woven carefully through the petals. This was what was so special about the flower. She plucked the bracelet from its petals and held it close to inspect the delicate silver.
It hosted a number of charms that Hermione studied closely; a tiny potions vial, a horse (or was it a thestral), a tiny lock with the initials D.M & H.G on it, a small sphere that twinkled with light bursts and a Peony flower in bloom that glowed bright colors that kept changing as Hermione clutched at it.
A charm bracelet that told a story- their story.
She fastened the bracelet around her wrist and made her way downstairs to breakfast to thank the man… who had stolen her heart.
 
-----------------------------------
 
The entire castle was buzzing, students ran through the halls quickly as the set up for the Champions ceremony was underway- each student competing for a place waited by the dining hall for the moment that they could go in and take their positions. Draco stood at the back of the groups with the other entrances from Hogwarts. Dean was riling up Seamus telling him that Ginny would be picked over him because she was better- Ginny agreed wholeheartedly. Theo stood with Draco and Blaise but Draco knew where his loyalties now lie. As much as Draco was his best friend- Ginny was now a very big part of his life just as Hermione had become the same to Draco.
He looked around the room to see if Hermione had woken yet and saw her descending the stairs- he couldn’t stop the smile that brimmed across his face. A small glint caught his eye and he saw the shining silver of the bracelet that he had given her, she was wearing it.
She slowly made her way through the crowd and found Weasley first- probably because of her red hair. Wishing her luck she then turned in the masses and spotted him, just like his face Hermiones lit up as she hurried over. She stood next to him as everyone began to filter through the doors into the main hall, they were slowly left behind but Draco couldn’t care less about the tournament now.
“So you like it then?”
She smiled gleefully towards him- “it’s beautiful Draco”. She turned towards him as they were now the only two in the entryway. Pressing up on the balls of her feet she inched closer to him-
They heard a throat clearing behind them and Hermione launched herself away from him like two negative magnets coming in contact.
“They are about to announce the champions- Mister Malfoy, I believe you have entered your name. I’m sure you would like to be present if you do end up being named as Hogwarts Champion” Headmistress McGonagall drawled to him with a fixed look of disapproval on her face. She took one look at Hermione and changed to one of cautious questioning.
Draco walked forward through the doors to settle himself into the group of Gryffindors.
The first name to be called was from Durmstrang- an extremely large gorilla walked through the great hall to retrieve his name from the Headmaster. Aemilius Grigor- every man and his dog from Durmstrang were chanting ‘Emil’ as he walked back to join his peers revelling in their excitement. He shot his eyes over to a group of girls from Beauxbatons and languidly winked at them- like he was the fucking king.
Draco turned his head quickly as he felt a soft hand slide into his grasp- Hermione stood next to him but concealed their hands as to not draw attention. They hadn’t made it know that they had been… what? Dating, seeing each other, trouncing around Paris and kissing in dark places? Either way- it wasn’t known to anyone but their closest friends and he guessed that was how she wanted to keep it.
Next came the Hogwarts Champion- they always kept the host school for last. There was an eerie silence that went through the hall as they all held their breath. McGonagall stepped up to the cup and a small blaze ignited shooting a small crisp parchment flying into the air before floating quickly into her waiting hand.
The silence was deafening.
“Draco Malfoy”. Her voice rung out in the echoing hall.
He felt Hermiones hand tighten its grasp to an almost punishing strength but he didn’t know why- his ears were ringing, he wasn’t sure if what he heard had been real. No one else had made a sound. There were no excited exchanged, no patting on the shoulder- maybe McGonagall had made a mistake.
When he didn’t move Hermiones hand slid down and out of his grasp- it woke him to the starch realization as Theo turned to him and smiled- he had in fact been chosen as the Hogwarts Champion. Instead of making his way to his Headmistress, McGonagall recognized his frigid stance and closed the space herself. She handed him the parchment and looked at him like she was handing over his expulsion letter to Hogwarts- sorry look and all.
There were quiet murmurs in the hall as everyone recognized the name- If they hadn’t known he was attending they certainly did now.
A great bellowing noise sounded as they continued with their selection- the final Champion; a girl from Beauxbatons- Elouise Moreau. Again her friends and teachers eagerly celebrating her as she took the paper and returned to the group of girls that the Durmstrang Champion winked at.
The festivities continued as the Champions were called forward to speak with the Heads of school in a private room to the side of the hall. Draco felt an empty space as he reluctantly separated from Hermione. Why in the fuck did he put his name in that cup? He finally had something good going for him in life and he has now gone and fucked it all up.
McGonagall looked at him with sympathy caked on- could she think him any more pathetic? He closed the door behind him and the Head of Beauxbatons began the rehearsed speech. “There will be a slight change this year, due to the last Triwizard Tournament. We can not inform you of what this is, however you must know that this year will be safer for everyone” he said.

  What in the bloody hell does he mean by that? ‘Safer for everyone?’


  Would they make sure there were no blood-thirsty murderous wizards at the end of the tournament ready to annihilate three quarters of wizard-kind?

He scoffed and McGonagall turned towards him scolding him with her eyes. Draco bit his tongue and waited out the rest of the boring dribble. “As you all know, we will be hosting a Yule Ball in one weeks time- this will signify the beginning to the Tournament. I suggest you all find partners if you don’t already have one and practice the opening dance for Champions- plan on a fun night as the next day you will be competing”.
Dracos stomach sank- firstly about the ball- second about completing in a tournament that he didn’t know he even wanted to compete in anymore. Just his fucking luck.
The Champions left the small room with the Heads of House and Draco was about to make his way over to Blaise and Theo when he was roughly pulled by his elbow out into the hallway- “I hope you know what you are doing Mister Malfoy” McGonagall questioned.
He stayed silent waiting for her to elaborate.
“Miss Granger has always been one for assisting where necessary and trying to fix that which is broken- if I am correct in what I have observed over the last few weeks and you do in fact care for her then I suggest you distance yourself with the tournament coming up. This will by no means be an easy competition, it will take its toll on you and those around you. Should you care for Miss Granger at all it would be wise to make sure she has no part in the upcoming trials”.
Draco couldn’t speak- he didn’t know what would come out of his mouth even if he could. She knew about him and Granger- and now McGonagall thought it too dangerous for him to be with her?
As if sensing his apprehension she continued- “you know what Mister Potter went through during his time as Champion, Miss Granger went through it all with him. Do you really want her to do it again- be put in harms way?”
Draco stiffened, a low growl erupted from his chest as he fought off the urge to yell- “I would never-” he was cut off.
“Good, at the ball make sure she understands that she cannot be involved at all- you and I both know that the games are meant to test the Champion in all different ways, even using those that they care for against them. I may not be happy with the outcome and pick of the Hogwarts Champion but I can try to keep those safe that warrant special consideration. Mister Malfoy, I do not doubt your abilities to succeed at this Tournament- your past… experiences... have seen you placed in situations that are both dangerous and traumatic, however I will not let Miss Granger ‘go down with the ship’ as they say if you are not to succeed”.
Draco was furious- he stormed off, leaving McGonagall alone in the hallway. He didn’t stop for breakfast, instead heading straight up to his room and planning on staying there the remainder of the day.
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione hadn’t seen Draco again that day, as the other Champions filtered back into the room he was nowhere in sight, neither was Headmistress McGonagall. She presumed they had stayed back to talk but when he still didn’t emerge after McGonagall came back she knew something was wrong.

  She would go see him after lunch.

 She spoke to Theo before she left the table, he would keep Blaise preoccupied while she sought out Draco. She climbed the winding staircases to the boys Dorm rooms and she knocked quietly on the door. There was a shuffling noise behind it as she stood silently waiting.
After a minute she called out to him- “Draco, I know you’re in there. Let me in before someone sees me here”.
She heard him sigh as he crossed to the door and opened it- he stood in front of her in sweat pants… only.
She silently took him in and held back her quivering voice- “what happened? Where did you go after the announcement?”

  Gods she had never seen anything more perfect than this man in front of her.

His tall lathe body stretched almost to the edge of the doorway as he rested his arms high above leaning against the frame. All the muscles in his arms and body flexing at the pressure. She swallowed as quietly as she could- she had remembered how amazingly fit he was from the carriage ride over- but being up close she could see all of the rippling curves and lines that made his body tantalizing and unbearable for her not to stare at.
He noticed her gaze- “Granger, my eyes are up here”. He chuckled quickly then caught himself and turned to walk back into the room.
Hermione followed him without question and sat down on the bed across from his. “So” she said when he still hadn’t answered her question.
“I.. I just didn’t feel like celebrating”.
“Do you not want to do this?”
“I do-” He was fighting to hold something back, Hermione could tell. He was so obvious sometimes she wondered why he was still trying to shield himself from her. He cut off her thought- “go to the Yule Ball with me”.
She was surprised at the turn in conversation- “I.. yes of course” she smiled. Next she knew Draco was walking over to her and grabbing her hand. She thought maybe he wanted to practice the dance that they would have to do. Luckily she had learnt the steps when she attended the ball with Victor Krum in forth year.
She thought about dancing with Draco and it sent shivers up her spine, she would press her hands softly against his strapping shoulders as he stood there without a shirt on- the feel of his soft skin across her fingertips… she would push him down to the bed and do unspeakable things to him for hours.
Instead he pulled her from the bed and walked her to the door. 
“I really need to rest, can I see you tomorrow?” She was taken aback.
He opened the door and very slightly pushed her out before closing it behind her not even waiting for an answer. What the fuck just happened?
Walking back towards her Dorm she was confronted in the walkway by Blaise and Theo- “I think I need to have a chat with Draco, surely a girl leaving his room this early can’t be a good sign. And here I thought I would get a little show when I walked in” Blaise joked.
Theo covered his face with his hand and sighed- “Sorry Granger, I tried to hold him off but he worked out why I was stalling”.
Blaise started laughing and Hermione turned scarlet- if she had of had her way then they most definitely would have gotten a show before they realized they had company.
Theo picked up the awkwardness and quickly tried to disarm- “well we better be off, I told Ginny I would take her hiking tomorrow- she’s pissed she wasn’t named the Champion”. He went red and then corrected himself- “not that Ginnys pissed at Draco because he got it”.
“Theo it’s fine, I’ll go talk to her now-” she said as she walked past them thankful that the conversation had come to an end. Just as she was about to turn the corner Blaise called out- “Hey Granger, if Draco can’t get it up I’m always available” he chuckled to himself.
She heard Theo punch him and a loud “Ouch” echo through the walkway.

The general acceptance of Draco as the Hogwarts Champion was slowly taking hold- Ginny was the first to give in and stopped planning an elaborate hex that would see Draco unable to compete due to incapacitation. The rest of the student body took a little longer as Hermione had worked on Ginny the day of the announcement.
Soon enough the day of the Yule Ball had arrived- Draco had kept his distance for some reason that he was not sharing with Hermione and she was about ready to let Ginny hex him for it. He had not wanted to practice their dance together- stating that she already knew it so he didn’t need to teach her. He hadn’t wanted to go out of the castle and explore with her. Everything that he did continued to infuriate her and she had no idea why he had become so distant.

  What had McGonagall said to him after the Champions announcement?

Hermione had travelled into the heart of Paris with Ginny and Luna to choose out her dress for the ball- it had cost her close to a fortune which she used her tutoring money to pay for. As she got ready that night her friends buzzed around her excitedly fussing over her hair and make-up. She only looked in the mirror and felt emptiness in her chest, like something was missing, something had been torn from it and left a gaping hole in its stead.
“Still hasn’t spoken to you?” Ginny asked as she stood behind her looking at the reflection in the mirror. Hermione shook her head and looked down at her bare feet as she curled her toes for any kind of sensation that wasn’t hurt.
“Well he will have to tonight, you have the first dance together- just corner him and he will have to”. Ginny smiled sweetly to her in the mirror. She reached over to the bedside table next to Hermiones bed and picked up the bracelet- extending her hand towards Hermione she fastened the silver around her wrist and patted her hand like a mother would a young girl who had her heart broken.
Once they had all finished getting ready Hermione took one last look in the mirror before she walked with her friends down to the main hall.
 
------------------------------------
 
Draco and Theo stood at the base of the stairs awaiting the arrival of their dates- both in freshly pressed dress robes they had sent home for. They were certainly ‘dressed to impress’ as Blaise put it- Draco had just rolled his eyes.
Draco knew that tonight would be difficult- he would need to let Hermione down gently if he ever had a chance of winning her back at the end of the Tournament. He had thought over the last few days about what McGonagall had said to him- it wasn’t fair for her to go through this again.
Resolved to the fact that he would need to upset her to push her away he had replayed over and over in his head different scenarios and things that he could say that would hurt but not destroy. God, I don’t want to do this.
His nerves were shot, he stood there fidgeting and Theo kept throwing glances his way as he waited with him patiently for the girls to arrive. Draco heard Theo gasp and he followed his gaze to the top of the stairs.
His eyes completely drawn to the beautiful girl in blue- his heart stopped.
Hermiones dress cascaded down her body and trailed behind her as she slowly descended the stairs- covered in intricate beading it shone in the light making her look completely flawless. Dracos eyes gazed over her slight curves and the plunging neckline to her dress. He wanted to bound up the stairs, carry her to her room and make her forget about their past, present and future with one un-fucking-forgettable night.
Fair to say he must have been drooling, Theo leaned close to him and whispered- “close your mouth mate”. Draco only just registered what he said as the girls stopped just shy of them and they both giggled at his reaction.
He flushed an immediate shade of red as he caught his breath and gained his sense again. His arm shot out to her and she took it immediately. Her hair was tamed into an almost manageable wave and was braided in different places to host a delicate silver hairpiece. Draco spied the bracelet dangling finely around her wrist and a flutter ran through his chest. He led them into a small room to the side of the hall that the Champions had met in the first night and they waited with the others to be led out on parade.
“You look handsome” Hermione whispered into Dracos ear as they stood side by side waiting in line by the door. He was trying not to stare at her, every time he did he was taken, he kept falling further and he had to stop himself. He wouldn’t be able to concentrate knowing at any moment she could be used against him in the tournament. He needed to cut ties, tonight. He nodded and saw her face shift, it fell and she looked down at her feet. He hated doing this to her but he had to, Draco could feel the sadness washing over her as he held her arm tightly- not really wanting to let go.
He would give her this one, just one for the night- “you look beautiful Granger”. Reverting to surnames would put her off but he knew it would create distance.
Hermiones questioning glare shot to him but before she could speak the doors to the hall opened and they were overwhelmed with shouting and applause- the line of Champions began to filter into the hall and Draco pulled at Hermiones arm before she could interject. There was no question, they were not prepared for the dance as they entered the room and crossed to the dance floor in the center, Dracos stomach tightened at the idea of attempting this dance without practice. He knew Hermione had danced this very number with Krum last TriWizard but Draco had only watched on; staring at the brunette and how she had transformed from a ‘Mudblood’ swot to a graceful woman in their fourth year. If Draco was honest with himself, that was the night that he had seen Hermione Granger in a different light.
He walked them to their allotted place and took Hermiones hand in his as he gently pressed his hand against the small of her back, his memories flashed back to the night of the Hogwarts Yule Ball- the way that he had imagined himself dancing with her, gliding her across the dance floor gracefully in her periwinkle dress- holding her gently, pressing her against his body as they looked into each others eyes. He tried not to do any of those things tonight, as much as he truly wanted to.
Creating a distance between their bodies, keeping his hand on the small of her back and not wandering down. His eyes filtered across the room to different points as the music begun. All of Dracos childhood he was forced by his pureblood mother to take dance classes, ‘to be a Malfoy heir you must behave like one, knowing how to dance is imperative’ his mother always said as she got him ready for his lessons.
It was (in this case) paying off, he moved with practiced grace across the dance floor with ease- maneuvering Hermione like a pliable doll to the echoing music. Draco knew better than to look at his feet, he also knew better than to stare at Hermione in her dress- so instead he picked different points around the room to look as he whirled around.
Hermiones hand tightened around his and she clasped his shoulder roughly as she leant into his cheek- “what is going on Draco? Why won’t you even look at me?” He felt his stomach drop and his throat became dry. How was he going to answer her? He paused- “I think that we are moving too fast, maybe we need to just hold off for now and take a break” he said quietly somehow hoping she wouldn’t hear and just drop it.
“A break? You’re the one that has been trouncing me all over Paris, giving me flowers and buying me jewelry”. Hermione scoffed. “I can’t believe you are doing this right now”. She looked away from his face, Draco saw a tear escape the corner of her eye and he felt himself shatter. Fuck, what have I done?
“Just until the Tournament is over, then I can give you the attention that you deserve”. He tried to back-track. The music was coming to a close and he placed his hands on her hips, lifting her into the air she dropped her head so that no one would see her tear streaked face. Draco placed her back on the ground and the music stopped. He went to grab her hand and she pulled away quickly retreating from the hall as fast as she possibly could. He was left standing in the center of the room, without a partner, without her, without his heart.
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione climbed the stairs in a blur, tears streamed down her freshly made up cheeks- she was furious, she was stomping her feet with every step, but most of all she hurt. She hadn’t realized how much she actually cared until he had just yanked her heart from her chest and stomped it on the ground. Her chest was heaving as she tried to hold it in until she was in her room- strangled sobs came from her throat as she rounded the last corner and she dived through the door as she lost it spiraling into her bed and burying her face into the pillow.

  How could she feel this way about someone so selfish- how had she let it get this far with him- Draco FUCKING Malfoy!

She screamed into her pillow, running out of air quickly and lifting her head as she sat up willing the tears to stop- it only made her cry more.
There was a quiet knock on the door and Ginny slowly entered the room, she looked like she was attempting to approach a dangerous lion that could lunge at any moment. She took a seat on the edge of Hermiones bed and placed a hand on her shoulder running small circles along her back. “What happened?” Hermione was about to fall apart again- not that she had gathered herself in the first place. Through pants and sobs she said “he said we were moving too fast and that he wants to have a break from whatever the fuck this is” she gestured at herself and then to the door like Draco was standing there.
“He did fucking not! I’m going to kill that bloody ferret!” Ginny was winding herself up, amped for a fight. “After everything he has done in pursuing you and now to just drop you like this- what the fuck is he thinking”. Ginny grabbed at Hermione and pulled her in for an unexpected hug, Hermione about fell off the bed as she came face to face with Ginnys cleavage in the bone crushing embrace. Hermione broke free and turned over lying down on her bed- “you should go back to the ball; Theo will wonder where you went. I don’t want to ruin your night because of him”. Ginny lay down next to her on the tiny bed and wrapped her arm around her.
“Theo will understand- he will probably kill Malfoy, but that’s really a win win for us. I want to be here for you”.
Hermione chuckled through her tears and then fell silent. They stayed this way for a long time; she managed to calm her breathing after a while to give the deceit of sleep. Ginny took the chance and slipped away silently to return to the ball- leaving Hermione to start her pity party all over again. She fell asleep some time around one in the morning and was roused at three when Luna and Padma returned. Ginny ended up spending the night somewhere else. Hermione would wait till Ginny was ready to tell her what her and Theo got up to that night. At least someone was getting some.
 
--
 
The next morning the castle thrummed with excitement- magic coursing through the hallways and they all gathered for breakfast. Hermione made sure to arrive right at the end of serving and she sat as far from Draco as humanly possible. Her eyes were red rimmed and dark circles rounded her lids- cheeks puffy from the night of almost endless crying that she endured. She gathered a small amount of food on her plate, not actually hungry. She chanced a look over to him and found that he looked almost as terrible as she did- the nerves of todays events must be getting to him. He had only a few slices of fruit on his plate that he hadn’t even touched- she hoped that Theo or Blaise would end up force feeding him something, anything- just so that he had a level head and the stomach for whatever the tournament threw at him today.
As she finished up the few bites of her breakfast she could stomach she made her way back to her room to get ready for the first event of the tournament. It seemed strange to her; wearing Hogwarts school colors, school pride for their Champion; when not even twenty-four hours ago he had decimated her heart. Still, she dressed up with the other girls and battered off Ginnys sympathetic stares as they made their way back down to the great hall for direction from there.
The students filtered out into the gardens of the castle- slowly making their way to Port-key points across the way- professors from Beauxbatons stood at each point awaiting groups of ten students standing in a circle before they handed over a small silver coin to the center. Hermione joined a small group of Gryffindors and Beauxbatons girls and felt the familiar tug from her stomach as the port-key was handed to the center and they were whisked away to an unknown location.
A large field of trees and wooden fence lines stood in the middle of the vast space, inside the fence were various obstacles and coverings- quite similar to an obstacle course Hermione thought to herself. This connected to the treetops and made for many places that someone could lay in wait ready to strike. Large bleachers were set up outside of the fence line for the students to take position on and be able to see over the field below. A loud voice boomed from the watch tower with the best vantage point. This must be where the judges were hosted.
The stands were almost full as the crowds began to erupt with the arrival of the Champions into the fenced off area- the three stood proud in a line and faced the tower ready for instruction. Hermiones breath caught as she saw the look of concern but pure determination on Dracos face. He looked so young, his features tight with thought and his fists balled ready for the fight. Hermione wanted to run out onto the field and throw her arms around him- show him that she was on his side- maybe give him the confidence that he needed to win.
“Welcome to the first stage of the TriWizard Tournament!” The Beauxbatons Headmaster could be heard saying across the entire clearing. “The Champions today will take part in hunter and gatherer- the objective is to use any means necessary to retrieve your wand from one of the oppositions start point and be the last one standing at the end returning to your own origin point. If you are incapacitated you are out. This event is meant to test the Champions physical and magical abilities and the one standing at the end will be awarded points to the final tally”.
“Champions- please find the port-keys on the table in front of you that will place you in the allotted start point”. Each Champion made their way to the table ahead of them and Hermione could see small color coded keys for each school. Emil was the first to place his hand on the key in front of him and he immediately disappeared into the course hidden and accompanied by an opposing Champions wand. Elouise from Beauxbatons was the next Champion to go, leaving Draco behind looking apprehensively at the port-key in front of him. Hermione couldn’t help but frown to herself at the use of port-keys during the tournament considering what had occurred at the last TriWizard.
She watched his face as he cautiously reached out, he looked lost without his wand but she knew that he would do well in this round- he had the proper training and had spent months perfecting his fighting abilities while under the watchful eye of Voldemort and his Aunt. Before he pressed his hand to it he looked around at the crowd. He was searching- searching for her? She stood in her seat but was obstructed by the group in front that stood to cheer on the Durmstrang Champion. Hermione felt her heart sink that she couldn’t have that moment with him before he began but found herself silently cheering on Draco- her mind telling her not to, but her heart saying she needed to.
Hermione placed a hand against her chest to settle her thumping heart as Draco pressed his hand against the key and disappeared from the clearing. The music from the band sounded to signify the start of the round.
  
    Chapter Text
    Complete darkness enclosed the area that Draco was transported to- he could see tiny flecks of light, barely bigger than a pin-prick and he gathered that he was inside some sort of enclosed hideout. Taking a moment to center his nerves he took in a few gasping breaths. His heart beating almost out of his chest as he comprehended what he had to do, he felt completely lost without his wand in this moment but took comfort in knowing that none of the other Champions had theirs either.His mind racing back to before he had touched the port-key, his gaze ran over the crowd- looking for the familiar brown untamed hair. He just needed to see her once, to calm his nerves- even if she hated him right now. His heart sunk when he couldn’t find her- there were too many students to wade through. A knot grew in his stomach realizing that he might not have the chance to see her again, what if something happened and he was never able to say goodbye- never able to tell her how he actually felt.He steadied himself, this was a race against time and the other Champions- he needed to get his head in the game.Draco pushed at what felt like a straw covered wall and it gave under his force- light beamed through the hole he had made and he took in the limited surroundings that he could see. He was definitely up in the canopy of the tree line. Which meant the likelihood of him stepping from this ‘safety bubble’ and falling from the tree to his death were quite likely. Scratching away at the frail straw he made the hole larger to be able to fit his body through and observe an escape route that might work for him.The rope network that spanned across the canopy of trees gave him the option to grab hold of one that lead to a lower network- he would just have to climb his way across and hope to fuck that he didn’t fall. As he reached out and grasped at one of the ropes he turned back to see if there was anything he could use to aid him left in the cocoon. All he saw was a neutral wand with a delicate wood carved handle sweeping in great loops. He assumed that the wand belonged to the girl from Beauxbatons- it would not be an easy fete for her to muscle her way up the rope network to retrieve her wand. This thought spurred him on, maybe he could win this- this challenge would be won or lost against the Champion from Durmstrang.Draco leant out of his start point and felt his feet leave solid ground- his shoulders were screaming at the weight of his body hanging solely by his arms. He needed to move quickly. Fist by fist he moved his way along the hanging rope towards a ledge on a tree close to his. His distracted mind caught as he looked down, all he could see were tree branches- the ground so far down only small patches broke through. Dracos breath caught as he thought about how far he would need to go to reach the ground of the arena.He began his descent, carefully but with haste.After at least six different tree stops he found a single hanging rope that disappeared into the tree line. This had to be it. Reaching out he realized that he would need to jump to grab hold of it. Risk all to gain all. He swallowed the lump in his throat and leapt- clutching at the rope he held on as tightly as he could while his weight carried him down burning the palms of his hands and fingers as the rope slid through them. His yell of agony echoing through the tree tops as the throbbing pain begun to seep in, he couldn’t stop now- he needed to keep going to be able to finish the challenge. Slowly hand over hand he descended the rope into the canopy- his palms leaving a glistening trail of blood staining the rope as he went.He finally made it through the tree-line and he could see the vast grounds beneath him, no site of the other Champions.Could their start points be in the trees also? Would Draco have to climb again to retrieve his wand? He didn’t think it would even be possible for him to grab onto another rope without healing his hands first. He needed to find his wand.Planting his feet on the ground he thanked all the Gods that he was no longer vulnerable on the rope descending- he had even footing and he would make the most of it. As he took off running he maneuvered between trees and around bushes- climbing large log piles and always watching for any form of movement around him.It wasn’t until he had almost reached the other end of the fenced arena that out of the corner of his eye he saw movement. Completely out in the open he ducked for concealment- the flutter of dark hair caught his eye as Elouise ran past the trees nearby panting and terrified- hot on her heels was Emil, he was gaining on her pace, his muscular legs carrying him quicker than the Beauxbatons girls could. Draco watched as she realized she would not be able to outrun him. She turned to confront him as he crashed into her and they were sent flying to the ground in a great thud.The spritely petite girl reminded him of Hermione, her unruly hair was covered in dirt and twigs as she rolled around on the ground and the giant gorilla pinned her down. She fought with all her might- punching and kicking, she managed to land a right hook and the next moment Draco saw red as the Champion from Durmstrang fisted her hair and punched her square in the face. She let out a guttural cry as her nose broke with a loud crack and blood began streaming down her cheeks to the ground. Draco wasn’t thinking, he bolted from his concealment and careened into the Durmstrang boy tackling him off of the young girl as she writhed in pain on the ground. Emil was going to beat her- until she was incapacitated.  Draco and Emil rolled along the hard ground; each fighting for the upper hand in the battle- whoever ended on top would win the overall fight. Draco pushed back against Emil and landed a few meters away in the dirt- they heard a horn sound and both men looked towards the noise. Elouise was unconscious on the ground, her screams had ceased but the blood pouring from her face had not. A small wizard approached her on the ground and apparated her away. It was only the two of them left now.Draco made a conscious decision- he needed to find his wand. Emil was relying on brute strength to win this challenge but Draco was faster, years as a seeker had seen to a rigorous training schedule to keep him lithe and muscular. Before he could react he was set upon again- large hands closing around his shoulders and he was forced back as he tried to run. His hands were in no state to fight but he balled up his fists and used his reflexes to dodge and weave the big oafs advances.Managing to duck a thunderous fist heading straight for his cheek he sent an unexpected uppercut into the Durmstrangs chin and he went down. Without another glance Draco turned and ran- the direction that the two other Champions had bolted from was his best bet.He could hear earth shattering footfalls behind him as the rabid wilder beast attempted to gain on him but Draco was quick- he would be quicker if he knew where he was going. The decision was made for him when he saw a cocoon like pod sitting concealed in some bushes to the right of the main tower. Bee-lining for it he knew this was it, if he could just get his wand there was no way the other Champion stood a chance.Chest heaving and breath ragged as he ripped open the wall to the fairly large matted origin point- the hole on the other side gave the impression that it was possibly the great gorillas inhabitance. His heart was racing as he looked inside expecting his wand to be there. There was no wand.How did this happen, did Emil have his wand already and was waiting for the right time to produce it? Had the wand in Dracos origin point been Emils and not Elouises? He couldn’t stand around and wait- he needed to move. Draco bolted as fast as his lanky long legs would take him. Why didn’t Emil just hex him and get it over with?Draco heard the footsteps falter as the Durmstrang Champion slowed- he had caught Draco and was now shaping up for the fight. There was no way he had his wand, he would have just used it by now. Which meant that the Beauxbatons Champion had retrieved hers but had probably lost it in her altercation.He had to find Elouises origin point to locate his wand. If Dracos had been above the tree line, and Emils had been on the ground… he hazard a guess that Elouises origin would be in the canopy. He panned his view and scanned the space above him-
  There!
Draco launched himself towards a clearing ahead and through a dense bush land. This was definitely not the place he wanted to be wading through with a mammoth chasing him. Lithe legs bound him through the shrubbery but he heard Emil gaining on him. Only a little further. He had cleared the bushes and could see the specifically placed origin cocoon ahead of him, a large rope dangling from the entry point- he thought it quite an injustice that the two other champions had such easy means to exit and enter their origins when Dracos had been so difficult to access. Reaching for the rope as he closed in he felt a tight grip close around his ankle as he jumped into the air- Emil had caught him; Draco hadn’t anchored himself to the rope and fell to the ground, landing in a heap with a thud. There were roars of anger and cries of excitement as the fight ensued.All Draco could do was cover his face as Emil began furiously clawing up his body and straddling his waist to pin him down as the onslaught of fists thundered down into him. Draco could faintly hear a scream coming from the crowd as he tried to conceal any vital parts that would ensure his survival. All he could think was that it would have been Hermione- her scream, she was terrified. He needed to get out.Emil had let his guard down thinking that the fight was already won- he was not trying or even attempting to cover himself for a counterstrike. This is where Draco exceeded, strategy in the fight- not fighting hard, fighting smart. Draco picked his point and threw an almighty swing at the side of the Durmstrangs face, colliding with his jaw sending him off-balance as Draco rolled out from under him. Draco had enough sense still to climb as quickly as he could- there was no way that the great dark yeti would be able to lift his body weight like Draco could. No wondering he was relying on force instead of attempting to get his wand.Before he knew he was up on the landing in front of the cocoon and reefed the hay like material away to find his wand sitting on a stool at the very end. It sent a shock of relief over him as he smiled and realized the upper hand he now had. Grabbing at his wand and feeling the sensation of magic coursing through him was still the same as the day that he had got his wand.
  There’s still a game to play.
He turned and exited hearing the elation of the hordes as he held his wand into the air like he had already won the cup. The smile across his face couldn’t be removed- he was going to win this round.Looking towards the ground he noticed a lack of opposition- Emil wasn’t there.It was definitely a smart move on his part- now that Draco had his wand he was deadly… in another life.Draco climbed slowly down the rope- cautiously, making sure that he wasn’t going to be set on before he reached the bottom unexpectedly. Nothing. Draco made his decision and started a quick run back towards his home pod- he would need to find the hanging rope and then climb through the entire line system to get back- as he ran he cast quick healing spells across his bloodied hands, not enough to close them, just to cushion them so that he was able to utilize the strength of them to climb again.
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione was on the edge of her seat, she had bitten off half her bloody nails and in no time the rest would be gone as well. She couldn’t do this- as the Durmstrang Champion set on Draco and he fell to the ground she had jolted to her feet and screamed out as she watched the animal set into him without reprieve.Ginny had come to her side and was cradling her head in her hands but Hermione couldn’t look away. She knew that he could be hurt; she didn’t think that they would deliberately set other students on each other for entertainment. Her mind and heart were breaking with every sickening blow- she could see Draco rolling on the ground attempting to break free but could not find the release.“Hermione maybe we should go, you shouldn’t watch this” Ginny was saying into her ear over the thunderous crowd. Hermione didn’t even register what had been said, she needed to be here for Draco- this was all she could do. The thumping slowed, he was getting tired- she saw a glint in Dracos eyes as he uncovered his face- full of determination and anger as he plunged a hefty fist into the boys face sending him toppling over. Hermione let go of the breath that she was holding as he scaled the rope that he had been so close to before and went to retrieve his wand.As Draco was inside the cocoon Aemilius the Durmstrang played ran from the clearing into the bushes and trees to hide. There’s one thing worse than being hit by a Durmstrang boy- not seeing it coming.Draco emerged victorious from the cocoon with his wand in hand, like he had been revitalized. He climbed back down the rope slowly looking around for his competitor and couldn’t find him. Hermiones stomach sank as she thought about what the boy had planned for Draco and how he would surprise him.Draco ran for the area that he had initially come from and large screens rose into the area in front of them- playing out the scene as it unfolded. One screen followed Draco as he ran through the trees, she felt sick to her stomach as she saw him examine his hands- completely covered in blood, streaks of skin peeling from his palms from the rope burn. They would probably look similar if someone had taken a filet knife to them as torture. He cast a healing spell to seal the wounds and something else that Hermione hadn’t caught but they were still a mess. The angle panned out to show his face, bloodied and fresh bruising marred his skin.She had never seen him in this state, all she wanted to do was take care of him.Draco rounded the last tree to find the thin dangling rope ahead of him, it was long and would take a lot of his little energy to scale it. She could feel her heart thumping out of her chest as she watched him moving closer to the start point of his climb-Only then did she look over to the adjacent screen where a back view of Durmstrangs Champion showed him closing in silently on Draco- Draco hadn’t even registered his presence in the clearing but luckily Draco was fast- he had already began his ascent of the rope when Aemilius had lunged for him- unable to catch him before his climb.Emil did the only thing that he could to try and catch him, he begun to climb.The crowds were going absolutely off as the challenge was coming to an end, the rope swung precariously with both men trying to scale it- it was thin and it shook with the force of the weight on it. Draco tried to climb faster, he was gaining distance and Hermione was able to breathe again.There was a loud crack in the distance, not unlike lightning hitting- everyone went silent.All that could be heard were the loud cries as the two Champions began to free fall as the branch holding the rope gave out.Hermione realized the loud cries were coming from her as she watched Draco fall to the ground- laying lifeless in a heap next to the Durmstrang boy. -- It had been three days since the challenge had finished abruptly-Hermiones eyes were hanging out of her head, her bones were aching from the little sleep she had succumbed to in the chair next to Dracos bed in the hospital ward. Six broken ribs, a punctured lung, fractured hip, broken leg and a broken wrist. The matron said that he was lucky to be alive with the distance he had fallen.
  If this was the outcome to the first challenge she didn’t want to see what the tournament had in store for the final two.
He still hadn’t woken from the induced coma they had put him into, today they had begun slowly bringing him out- not wanting to shock his system, all his bones had been re-grown and set as he slept soundly. His face was almost a complete shade of purple and yellow bruises with large black rings around one of his eyes. Hermione just wanted to see his beautiful silver eyes stare at her again- she didn’t care what he had said, she needed to be here for him.Running her finger tips softly along his cheek and jaw he began to stir and her heart started doing somersaults. His eyes were the first thing to register his surroundings, they fluttered open and closed as he adjusted to the light in the ward. Hermione gently moved her thumb across his cheek letting him know that there was someone there for him, someone who cared. He turned his head towards her slowly, bewilderment in his eye- her breathing stopped. His hand jolted out and grabbed her hand that ran along his face. Oh gods, he didn’t want her here. Draco grasped at her wrist and then pulled her entirely towards him; she almost fell on top of him as he crashed his lips against hers like this was their last moment together. He hungrily took her in, wanting everything, taking it all. And she would give it all to him.His hands swept across her cheeks and pulled her face away slightly before moving her back in to pepper kisses across her face; “I’m sorry, I missed you so much, I’m so sorry- please forgive me” he said breathlessly. Her chest heaved as she took in what he was saying.“Draco you don’t need to be sorry- you did nothing wrong, it was all an accident”. She barely managed to get her words together as he swept across her face trying to smother her completely with his lips.“You are the best thing that has happened to me Hermione- I shouldn’t have pushed you away for this stupid tournament- you are everything to me!” He said the last words to her lips as he began to kiss her again, forcefully pressing against her as he took her breath away.She couldn’t believe what she was hearing, he had pushed her away to spare her from going through the tournament with him. He had become incoherent in his outburst, his voice was raw and gravelly from the strain of speaking. “So much… everything… be with me… tried to deny it… completely breathtaking and I can’t help myself…” He was stopped by the matron rushing over to stop the interaction happening between Hermione and Draco as his blood pressure was spiking and she was almost on top of him- which couldn’t be good for his ribs and hip.“I suggest that you go and rest Miss Granger, Mister Malfoy will be here when you come to visit later- I assure you I will take good care of him in your absence” she said in a kind voice but her eyes told Hermione it certainly wasn’t a suggestion and she would not be taking ‘no’ for an answer.Hermione moved back from her position half on the bed and half off where Draco had dragged her to and looked at him, his pained eyes wanted her to stay but she could see the exhaustion kicking in and knew that he would not be awake for long even if she could stay- he needed his rest. -- As she wandered the halls back to her dorm she realize she was more hungry than anything else, she hadn’t eaten since the second day in the ward when the matron had almost forced her out the door before she had promised to eat something. She changed her trajectory and made way for the Dining hall.The Champion who won the challenge had not yet been announced, all three had ended up incapacitated so they had put off the reveal and the next challenge until they were all back to full health. Draco had been by far the worst off- Emil had come out with a broken collar bone and three fractured ribs, he had also rolled his ankle from falling on it when the rope broke but he was closer to the ground and had knocked himself out with the impact when his ankle gave way.The greeting Emil had received when he returned from the ward was less than pleasant- every Beauxbaton student shot him dreadful glares and cursed him (verbally) as he walked the halls. The reaction from the Hogwarts students was similar, it seemed that Hogwarts and Beauxbatons developed a sort of truce with regards to the tournament and the students from Durmstrang were outcast for their less than cordial ethics.Hermione sat down at the bustling table of Hogwarts and Beauxbatons students and they ‘hushed’ and ‘shushed’ each other until the entire table was silent, waiting for answers to Dracos condition. “He just woke up” was all she could get out. Ginny sat down next to her and placed a caring hand across her shoulder.“How is he doing?” A look of genuine concern crossed her face. Hermione appreciated the effort- “He is doing better, slowly... he will be out of the ward by the end of the week the matron says”.Ginny gave her friend a hug and Luna said sweetly “that’s great news Hermione, we all think Draco is a great guy now”. Seamus nudged her slightly from his seat looking at her like she just gave away a big secret. Hermione chuckled slightly- “thanks Luna, I think he is pretty great too”.
  
    Chapter Text
    Draco spent the next four days in the ward recovering; that was a full week in total that he had lost. Hermione came to visit him every day and stayed for hours until the Matron kicked her out of a night time. They sat together talking, reading, learning about each other as they had plenty of time to spare. He felt as though he knew her completely- as his body grew stronger he took small liberties to pull her to him and they would spend as long as they could pressed perfectly together before the matron would bust them and break it up.He had let go of his reservations, truly opening up to this woman that had surprised him completely from the moment she had taken this chance on him. His walls quickly coming down and he could feel his heart change as he finally felt something foreign but real creep in. It scared him, more than anything before- but he knew that if he were to feel weakness she was the one person that he could do that with.She met him in the ward the morning the Matron had approved his discharge, greeting him with a wide smile she almost bowled him over as he stood and she ran towards him for a crushing hug. They held hands as they walked to the dining hall together and she opened the door as he walked inside- greeted by an eruption of applause and cheering as almost three quarters of the room got to their feet. Dracos heart rose as he realize this was all for him- he walked with Hermione to their table, stopping every few steps to receive a handshake or a hug- the Champion from Beauxbatons walked over and those around them fell silent.“Thank you, for trying to help me” she said as she smiled at him- that smile quickly turned to a grin- “Don’t think I will go easy on you though for the next round”.Draco chuckled as he nodded his acceptance of the circumstances and continued on to sit at the table with Hermione, Ginny and Theo. Conversation returned to normal shortly after and they discussed what had been happening around the school while he had been shut away in the ward.Neville joined them- “the schools are divided, and here we all thought you would be the one to play dirty-” he started laughing. Hermione shot him an angry glare. “What?” Neville shrugged, “he was a Death Eater for you know who…”Blaise sat down next to Theo- “plus he’s a Malfoy- shady folk if you ask me”. Draco scoffed. Hermione looked like she was ready to pounce on the next person to say a bad word about him. Theo laughed and put his hand on Hermiones shoulder- “we’re only joking around Granger, Draco has become somewhat of a hero around here since the first challenge. Everyone seems to love him- for some fucking unknown reason, I mean he’s a right dolt in my books”. The rest of the table erupted into laughter and Draco joined in. His rips slightly twinged with the sudden movements.He looked over at Hermione and the side of her lips curled as she began to join in the laughing- her face shone brightly and Dracos heart began thumping in his chest- Merlin he loved this girl, he didn’t know when it had happened or how- but he had completely fallen and he needed the right time to tell her.They finished their meal with jovial banter and exciting guesses at to the next round of the tournament- he could see the growing unease in Hermione and he reached for her hand squeezing it lightly to assure her he would be safe. Making their way out of the hall he grabbed her hand once again and pulled her to the doors- once outside the walls of the castle he whisked her down a pathway that led to the rolling vinyards.As they wandered slowly through each line all they had for company were each other- it’s all they needed.Draco walked to a clearing at the end and Hermione raced ahead to a small pond- a large weeping willow positioned itself beside the pond and the branches dipped low to meet the water. Sunlight beamed off the waters edge and bathed the clearing in light. Draco sauntered over to where Hermione had positioned herself, she shucked out of her jacket and transfigured it into a light blanket that she lay on the ground and sat herself on.Draco walked to the tree and disappeared under the curtain of hanging leaves- the leaves blocked out a lot of the light- Draco leant against the trunk and crossed his ankles over each other placing his hands into his pocket. He was the picture of suave. It took only a few moments for Hermione to meet him under the tree- she slowly approached him wondering what he was doing- her eyebrow arched in question.She inched closer; she was within an arms reach of Draco. Taking a hand out of his pocket he grabbed onto her school cardigan and pulled her lazily into him against the tree. She didn’t put up a fight, leaning into him he took her cheek in his hand and pressed sweet kisses against her mouth. Her eyes fluttered closed and Draco grabbed her waist pressing his body against hers.Hermione grabbed at the back of his neck and pulled him further in- their tongues meeting in a dance of lust. It became wicked and frenzied as they delved into something different from sweet and gentle- becoming needy and heated. Her hand grasped at the side of his neck as she broke away and ran her tongue along his pulse point. Dracos whole body shuddered at her touch- running his hands down her body he grazed over the top of her breasts and felt the distinctive budding of her nipples under the material.She let out a deep quiet moan as he perused her further, his hands met the bottom hem of her skirt and made a slow and lazy caress back up her thighs as she whimpered under his soft fingertips. Was this really happening? Draco couldn’t hold back any longer, he was too far gone. He held her thighs tightly in his hands and lifted her from the ground- she wrapped her legs around his waist as he gently knelt placing her underneath him.He grazed his lips over her neck and up to the shell of her ear. “I think… I’m in love with you Hermione”.She went still under him, he could feel her ragged breathing stop as she took in what he had just said- he was putting everything out there and he didn’t know what would end up happening.She reached up and caressed the nape of his neck with her gentle fingers and ran them through his hair- looking into her chestnut eyes she smiled with elation- “I think I’m in love with you, Draco…” His smile broadened his face as he leant in to kiss her again, and again… until they were both breathless.“I need to tell you-” he paused as she stopped her wandering hands. “This.. well, I haven’t done this before…” he looked down, purely embarrassed- “It was never the right person. But now it feels different, with you it’s different”.She pulled him down into a tight embrace and then rolled over to straddle him. “Is this what you really want?” She spoke quietly as she gauged his reaction, her soft beautiful features comforting in her question.“More than anything” Draco said softly.Hermione leant over and grabbed her wand from the ground- pointing to the canopy of the tree and casting a wordless spell, thousands of tiny lights shone into existence- like a whole constellation was brought to life under the darkness of the tree branches. It was completely breath taking- and so was she.Running his hands along her thighs and up to her hips, the hem of her skirt riding up to show off her dark laced underwear. Draco swallowed the lump in his throat, he felt strangely nervous- having had his fair share of moments with girls before, but nothing that compared to this-Hermione leant over kissing him softly, her fingers running gently along his skin as she lifted his shirt over his head- her lips ghosting over his as she started a slow grind over his hips. His cock was impossibly hard under her and it was begging to be let free from its confines. She obliged moments later as she undid the buttons of his pants and released him.She ran her hand across the tight flesh curling over the end and back again- she had him gasping as she lazily brought her hand to her mouth licking her finger and placing it between her thighs- she let out a lovely moan as she moved her knickers to the side and played with herself in front of him in anticipation. He could feel the call to her center as she moved back into position, she held the base of his cock in her hand and slowly sunk onto it.They both called out as the pressure and want grew- he had never felt anything this amazing in his life. Her tight perfect cunt wrapped around him as she lowered to the hilt, taking all of him in. She steadied herself as she placed a hand on his chest and began to rise again before plunging down quicker setting a slow pace. “So perfect- fuck, you feel amazing” he said as he looked at her ethereal form on top of him.Draco held her hips tightly as he encouraged her faster movements- they were both gasping and moaning with each thrust and dip. “Fuck, Draco- Yes!” Hermione cried as he felt a flutter within her. He rolled her onto her back as he quickened, thrusting into her as he held her steady. He grabbed at her shirt and ripped the front apart sending buttons flying across the grass. Her breasts exposed to the cool air and her nipples hardened as he took one into his mouth and she let out a guttural moan. He could feel her coming undone beneath him and he was close to following her.Lifting her thigh to his hip he angled deeper inside as she began to quiver and gasp- “Yes! Just like that- so deep, Fuck!” Her words sent him over as she began her quaking orgasm, her walls pulling him in as they tightened, his come released into her and she moaned feeling the heat pooling inside.He collapsed onto her in a panting sweaty mess as they both forgot how to move or think. She stroked his hair as he breathed raggedly into her neck completely spent. They lay in the soft glow of the lights for what felt like hours- --Lunch was long over by the time they made their way back to the castle and dinner preparations had begun. McGonagall found the two in the entry hall and eyed their hands as they clasped together. “I see you two are together Miss Granger, Mister Malfoy”. Hermione nodded her head and Draco looked settled in his decision. McGonagall gave a curt nod then continued- “they will announce the scores for the challenge tonight after dinner Mister Malfoy- be sure that you are present. It would have been done sooner, however you’re absence at lunch was noticed”. Hermione froze next to him and he looked over to her completely scarlet face as he began to chuckle.McGonagall didn’t miss a beat- “I shall see you both tonight then”. She strolled off, a picture of elegance and never in a hurry. Hermione couldn’t contain herself as she plunged her face into her hands and let out a small squeal. Draco started laughing as nothing could possibly alter his mood today- he had just had the shag of a lifetime and he didn’t care who knew.
  
    Chapter Text
    Dinner began when they all sat down to the table in the dining hall- plates upon plates of delicious food piled in the centre of each table. Seamus and Dean had filled theirs to the brim as they stuffed their faces. Hermione slowly served up a hefty plate and settled in her seat.Blaise looked over to where she sat next to Draco- “Christ Granger, anyone would think you worked up an appetite what with missing lunch and all. On second thoughts, Draco- didn’t you miss lunch as well?”Hermione choked on a string bean that she had shoved into her mouth and spat it clear across the table. Blaise started roaring holding his stomach like father Christmas. Theo smirked slyly next to him as Ginny elbowed him. Seamus decided to add his two bob- “can’t wipe the smile of yer’ face Malfoy- she does look thoroughly shagged though”. Ginny- bless her soul, threw an extremely large potato at Seamus who narrowly dodged it and quickly shut his mouth.The subject was quickly changed as Hermione tried to melt under the table and disappear from existence.A short time later the Headmaster from Beauxbatons stood from his end table and clicked his wine glass gently with his spoon. The hall went silent as he spoke.“As we all know, the last round for the TriWizard was not completed by any of the Champions- however, points will still be awarded for those closest to the win. He waved his wand towards a large score board and the three champions names appeared down the side in perfectly neat script. He began with the Champion from his school- “Miss Moreau; before your incapacitation”, he shot an angry pointed look towards the Durmstrang boy. “you had retrieved your wand- however on your way back to origin you encountered Mister Grigor and subsequently lost it again as you fought through the arena”. There were loud ‘boo’s’ coming from the crowded hall and most of the students from Beauxbatons had turned to glare at Emil.“For your efforts in retrieving but then losing your wand you have been awarded five points”. There were loud calls and excitement as she was congratulated.“For Mister Grigor-” the ‘booing’ started again. “Who did not even attempt to locate his wand and determined that forced incapacitation was the alternative- also managing to cause your own knock-out from the challenge- you have been awarded two points”.There was loud banging of fists and feet on tables and floors as Hermione tried to determine whether people were happy or upset with the points the Emil had received. There was only Draco left. She squeezed his hand tightly under the table as the Headmaster turned towards him and gave him a short nod. “Mister Malfoy- not only did you locate your wand and almost make it back to your origin point with it, had it not been for the unfortunate accident- you also attempted to assist another champion which is uncommon in these arenas and games”. Hermione looked at Draco, a mix of pride and elation in her eyes as she watched him smile at the words.“You have been awarded eight points, making you the winner of the first round and also leader at this point in the TriWizard Tournament”. Draco was speechless, his mouth agape as his fellow Hogwarts peers patted his shoulders and cheered for him- not only them but the students from Beauxbatons as well. Hermione watched his reaction as he realized that for once in his life he wasn’t the bad guy, he wasn’t feared by those around him and he wasn’t second best- he was just him, his own person.The Headmaster set the date for the next challenge, one week away and bid goodnight to the students as they made their way to their dorms. Hermione and Draco lingered in the entry hall as people stopped to congratulate Draco, he slowly inched further and further away from the doors and finally pulled Hermione into a small alcove hidden by a suit of armor.“I can’t stop thinking about today” he said breathlessly as he began kissing her fiercely- his movements swift and needy. Hermione moaned into his mouth as he ran his hands down her back and up her skirt to cup her arse tightly. Were they about to fuck in an alcove right next to most of the student population of Beauxbatons?Hermione grabbed his tie and wound it around her hand pulling him in closer as he forced her body against a wall with his. He lifted her thigh as she wrapped her leg around his hip and he caressed the back of her leg slowly skimming towards her core. Shock waves rippled through her body as she anticipated his touch, already wet and completely willing Hermione was about ready to jump him there and she didn’t care who would see.They heard a small cough come from the entry to the alcove and both stood completely still. The figure that had interrupted leant haphazardly against the stonework and cleared his throat again. As soon as he spoke they knew their time together for the night was finished. “Drake... you do sound busy in there”, there was a quick chuckle- “but Theo wanted to meet us about something”.“Fuck off Blaise” Draco said in a deadpanned voice as his hand slowly began wandering across Hermiones body again, she swatted them away with a pointed look.“Hey, if you would prefer me come in there to pull you out I’m more than happy”.Hermione looked down and realized that at some point Draco had undone her shirt and her red lace bra was prominently showing even in the dim light- not to mention the precarious position she was in currently wrapped around Dracos body.Draco sighed loudly enough that Blaise began to chuckle again- he slowly placed Hermione back to her feet and started walking to the entryway. “You’re a right fucking git you know” Hermione heard Draco say as he spoke to his friend outside the alcove.Hermione laughed quietly to herself. “Hold on-” he said.There was shuffling outside and Draco rounded the corner again grabbing her hand and pulling her towards him. He held her by the waist and crashed his lips into hers. They kissed for only a few moments, enough to leave them both short of breath. “Today was probably the best day of my life…” he said as he caressed the back of her neck running his fingers through her curls. “You are by far the most amazing person I have ever known Hermione Granger”.   With that he gently kissed the back of her hand and left to head back to his dorm with Blaise. Hermione was left completely in a daze- butterflies humming through her chest as she recited the words just spoken to her. She left the alcove and pointed her nose towards her dorm for the night, not until she had walked through the door and laid down in her bed did she realize how extremely tired she was from the days events. She ended the night with thoughts of her stolen moments, his parting words and the fact that she- Hermione Granger made love to Draco fucking Malfoys. She smiled into her pillow and slept soundly the entire night.

    The next few days were filled with stolen kisses down secluded hallways, seductive glances over the dining tables and repeat trips to their tree down by the lake. Absolutely ravenous for one another, their attention did not go unnoticed.Draco barely had a moment to himself with the constant thoughts of his witch running through his mind. As he walked towards the dining hall for dinner he was intercepted by two large sets of arms grabbing hold of him and dragging him towards the front doors. “Don’t cry like a little boy Drakey- I promise it’s all in good fun” Blaise whispered to him before he had a chance to shout out. He went with them without a struggle.They walked through the grounds and out to the apperation point before Draco asked where they were taking him- “That’s for us to know and you to find out” Blaise said jokingly smacking Draco across the shoulder.“We are heading to a pub in Paris-” Theo said.“It’s about time we try some of their… mmmm…  ‘delicacies’” Blaise offered a wink at the two boys. Theo shook his head and rolled his eyes, “no, that’s not what we are doing… You need some time away from everything before the next challenge, and we.. well we need a bloody stiff drink”.Theo grabbed hold of Dracos arm and side-along apparated him to a small street overlooking a canal with a quaint bistro that lit up in the growing darkness. They could hear distant laughter coming from within the walls and were drawn to it immediately. “Besides- you don’t really have a choice, now that you’re outside the wards of the school you can’t leave my side without the authorities being alerted. I figured that one out when you kept disappearing with Granger” Theo grinned at him.“What, he can leave if he’s with you or Granger?..” Blaise looked confused- “Oh.. right, heads of school, probation etcetera”. They walked into the pub and took a booth near the end of the room. The puffy black leather seats fit the three men in comfort as they stretched their gangly legs out underneath.“So, now that you have kidnapped me and brought me to a shady bar to drink cheap shit whiskey- what’s the real reason I’m here?” Draco deadpanned as he took a sip of the ‘cheap shit whiskey’ Theo had motioned for to the bartender when they first entered the establishment. He winced as the unrefined flavor touched his tongue. Theo grinned over the top of his glass at Blaise- “well, got to get that game face on for the next part of the tournament- we thought maybe a little distance from a certain brunette would do you some good. You know, you have actually been walking around smiling, it’s very unnerving Draco” Theo laughed.“You can’t talk” Blaise piped in sending Theo a cheeky smirk- “that red-head has barely left your face since she mounted you at breakfast. Speaking of…” Blaise rounded on Draco as he propped himself up on his elbows- a quirked eyebrow to boot. “You and Granger seem to not be able to keep your hands off one another”.Draco grinned at the ceiling crossing his arms over his chest- “Would never kiss and tell mate”.“Oh… but it’s so much more right?” Theo piped in. “I mean you’re not even half the stuck up arsehole you normally are- might I be right in saying you finally lost it?”“None of your business Nott” Draco said calmly.“What?! Drake- you were a virgin?!” The whiskey glass coming down in a large thud next to Blaise almost spilling his drink everywhere.Draco turned his head towards Theo and rolled his eyes. Theo turned to the only one actually interested in what he had to say- “Didn’t you know- Draco was saving himself for the girl he intended to marry. I guess Mother and Father Malfoy are going to be looking for a new Malfoy Heir very soon”.“You know I don’t give a flying fuck what my parents think- it’s their fault I’m in this position in the first place. Fighting for my families name, having to risk my life because they got into bed with a deranged mass murderer. As far as I’m concerned anything that I do at this stage would help the cause, including ending up with the ‘golden girl’”.Theo looked at him quizzically- “ending up with… like long term mate?” Draco looked away realizing his slip of words. He knew it would never end up that way. He would never get the girl. He laughed and downed the rest of his piss flavored whiskey- “you and I both know guys like me don’t end up with girls like her”.Blaise was the one to break the silence this time, his usual jovial bravado dropped for a second as he tried on genuine- “maybe you’re not the same guy you were before- I’d like to think we have all changed a bit after everything that happened”.They all looked around the table and Theo raised his glass that had been re-filled with something a little more up-market- “to being better men, for our better women”. Draco and Blaise matched the toast and they continued into the night.Talking about Quidditch the guys seemed to trail off, leaving Draco to think about his intentions for Hermione. Did he intend to marry her? Would she become the first ever non-pureblood Lady Malfoy?
  Would she even want that?
   
By the time they stumbled back to the castle it was almost curfew, they had consumed more alcohol than they had intended; it had just gotten better with each drink- naturally.Tripping up the steps Blaise almost face planted into the fanciful stonework in the front entrance, both Theo and Draco burst into roars of laughter that echoed through the castle entry. “uh sod off you’s two!” Blaise called as he tried to scramble through the door.“We thought if anyone could hold liquor it’d be the guy who’s family owns vins.. vines.. vineyaaards all over Italy” Theo said through his pearls of laughter swinging his arms outrageously at the extent of Blaises families vineyards.“You two are fully sloshed… was this your plan? ‘snot a good one for sure” Draco grinned from the doorway watching his friends attempts at walking as he tried to lean against the frame, missing with his shoulder and colliding his face full force into it. Both the boys turned their laughter onto him as he dazedly reset himself upright and tried to stop the stars spinning around his head. “What on earth are you boys up to?” a loud call came from the other end of the entrance hall. Hermione stood there with Padma and Luna, each girl had a selection of books in their hands- clearly making the most of the Beauxbatons library. Draco jolted upright trying to fake sobriety as the other two didn’t even care to hide the fact that they were two parts past fuck eyed.Draco sauntered over to Hermione slowly with cautious footing, his cheeks completely red flushed- he stopped just a little too close to her without realizing and had to step back slightly before grabbing her hands. “Fuck, I’m the luckiest man alive” he said matter-of-factly.“Draco Lucius Malfoy, are you drunk?” Hermione questioned, trying to hide a giggle.Draco beamed at her as she smiled uncontrollable. She had to be the most beautiful woman he had ever laid eyes on. “Me?” he motioned to himself, hand over heart- “never love, I’m just dizzy with lust”. He moved in closer as Padma let out a quick squeal and Draco grabbed hold of Hermiones face bringing her in for an all but enticing wet kiss.Once Draco had broken away he realized that it probably wasn’t the best idea kissing someone after you tried to convince them you hadn’t been drinking to excess. Hermione would have tasted the burning liquor on him- “I think that maybe you three need to find your way to your room before curfew hits”.Turning towards his friends he saw Blaise winking seductively towards Padma and heard a giggle from behind him, Theo was babbling to Hermione about seeing Ginny and Draco had an absolutely brilliant idea- “I think we.. that maybe we should be monitored for the next hours… considering how inebriated we are- shit! I mean the other two boys are. It’s a matter of safety Granger, ‘nd as Head you should be responsible for our welbin’”. Draco slurred as he chuckled- “head girl. Think that title will suit you love”.Draco felt a sharp stinging pain as Hermione punched him in the arm- “Draco!” she yelled- “you can bet when you wake up tomorrow you will be in a whole world of pain for that comment”.“As long as I wake up in your bed you can do whatever you like to me” he winked. She grabbed his arm and motioned to the other girls to grab Theo and Blaise and they made their way up to their room. The smell of cheap whiskey and cigarettes wafted after them as they climbed the stairs, trying to keep quiet as they snuck into the girls dorms.It was no surprise that as soon as they walked through the door the barrage of berating that they received from Ginny was no warm welcome. “I can’t believe how drunk you lot got- and what? Now you want to stay in here? Our room is already full and you want to add three blokes to it?”Theo went over to her bed and climbed lazily on top of her as she protested, finally silencing once his entire weight covered her and he cuddled her tightly beginning to whisper to her how sweet and amazing she was. Maybe I should try that to get out of trouble with Granger- fuck, Hermione.Padma piped up quickly, “I don’t mind sharing my bed with someone…”Draco laughed, looking over to the dark haired girl- she was staring longingly towards Blaise who had taken up post against the wall leaning his head back against it and swaying slightly every few seconds.Blaises smirk grew quickly across his face as he registered his luck- he bounded over to the bed Padma was pointing towards and quickly shucked his shirt off his shoulders and kicking off his boots. Draco heard an audible groan as Padma looked over the tall dark and muscular man finding his way into her bed. He sat up under the covers as Padma silently made her way into the bathroom and quickly re-emerged wearing a less than appropriate black lace nightdress. Draco watched Hermiones face as she quietly chuckled taking in the scene unfolding before her.Blaises mouth hung open slightly as Padma walked towards the bed and only once she got to the edge did he snap out of it and lift the blanket for her to get in.Draco walked over to Hermione and grabbed her by the waist, pressing her back against his chest. He leant down to whisper in her ear- “this was not exactly the idea I had in mind when I thought we would be in bed together for the first time”. He could see the heat blooming on her cheeks and he chuckled to himself- he had sobered up slightly in their trek to the dorms. He grabbed her hand and entwined their fingers, everyone else had settled in and the guys were already snoring as he pulled at Hermiones hand towards the door way.He flicked his wand turning out all the lights as he quickly exited the shared room pulling his witch along with him- a grin plastered across his face as his scheme came to life. They raced through the dimly lit corridors and hid from a few of Beauxbatons head students patrolling as they made their way through the castle. “Where are we going Draco?” she questioned in whispering tones.“Did you want to stay with the snoring trolls for the night?”“No, of course not!”Her propelled her onwards as they climbed a flight of stairs and ran out to the spiraling staircase spanning the outside if the castle. He stopped mid way up as the full moon beamed down from the sky lighting the entire night. Hermione almost ran into his back as he stopped- “wait” he said as he turned to her and grasped at the back of her neck bringing her in for an earth-shattering kiss in the moonlight.Their lips ghosted over one another as they fought to catch their breath, each exhale was caught by the other. “You are enchanting witch. I have wanted to do that since the day we got here- every night I pass this spot and think of you”.A smile lit up Hermiones face in the bright glow and Draco grabbed her hand once again pulling her onwards.

    He slammed the door shut behind him as they raced into the room- the boys empty dorm was lit with a dwindling fire, completely cosy and perfect Hermione thought. Before she had a chance to turn Draco had his arms wound around her from behind, his breath ghosting over the nape of her neck and his hand slowly caressing her stomach and thigh. She shivered as his hand moved slowly under her shirt, the heat of his palm sending goosebumps across her warm flesh.“Hermione-” he breathed against her neck. She could hear the soft and sweet nature to his tone as he thought of words to say. “This feels like a dream”. He lowered his head to her shoulder and rested it there for a moment.“I can’t believe that this could be my life. After everything that I have said and done- I never imagined that I could end up worthy of someone like you… I still don’t believe I am” Draco said into the crook of her neck as his hands grasped around her stomach holding her tightly in a binding embrace.Hermione laid a hand over his and ran her other through his hair at the nape of his neck, she could feel her eyes prickling as she held back her voice, he obviously wanted to get this out- she wouldn’t stop him.“I will prove it one day, I promise I will never stop trying to prove that I can be the man that you deserve. Even if it takes forever, Hermione”.She felt a small drop touch her shoulder as one of his hands left her stomach to wipe his cheek. She turned in his arm, there was nothing to say- she did the one thing she knew would be comfort in this moment. She held his cheek tipping his face to hers, his eyes red rimmed and raw with tears- she leant up on her toes and kissed him softly, trying to convey everything in that one kiss.
  She wanted him, she needed him- forever if she was lucky enough. She loved him.
He curled his hand through her hair bringing her closer, his lips searching and needy- she slowed him down. You are everything that I could ever hope for- her hand ran down the front of his chest and rested over his heart. Dracos hand moved up to encase hers, she could feel his beat quicken, fluttering under her touch- he could feel it, she knew he had worked it out.She had his heart- and he had hers.That night it wasn’t sex, they made love- unguarded, completely open and heartfelt. -- They woke in the morning to students running and yelling in the hallway, Draco had transfigured the three dorm beds together into a large king four poster that spanned halfway across the room. Hermione shifted slightly in a sleepy haze as she curled her arm across Dracos waist, her hair cascading across his chest as she listened to the contented hum of his heart beat. She hadn’t thought that it would be possible to feel this way after the heartache from war- but here she was; wrapped in the arms of the man that she was in love with, breathing in his scent and cherishing every moment that she could spend with him without reserve.Draco ran his fingertips lazily across her shoulder and back, tracing small figures into her soft skin, it sent shivers across her body as she began to heat again from the touch. “Keep doing that and I don’t think I will ever leave this bed” Hermione said as she looked up at him with her chin pressed into his chest.“Do you think that the Headmaster of Beauxbatons would allow me to purchase this wing of the school so that we can stay here?” Draco grinned deviously as Hermione started to laugh.“There is the small matter of the Tournament that you still have to complete-”“Uh, yes… that small matter”. Draco ran his hand across the back of his neck and propped himself up to lean on some pillows, careful not to move Hermione from her position on his chest. “Well, I can always just forfeit and hide up here with you? Us Slytherines are well known for our self preservation after all”.“Yes, well… be that as it may I know that you don’t want to pass up this opportunity to help your families reputation and also Hogwarts as much as you pretend not to care”. She eyed him suspiciously, just begging him to oppose her comment so that she could debate further.“I guess it’s settled then, no purchasing of Beauxbatons dorms, no forfeiting of the tournament and no staying in this room” his hands began to wander to delicious places, “spending all of my time worshiping your body as it writhes underneath me while I fuck you senseless…” he had shifted his body to move down the bed closer to her.Hermione groaned at his crass declarations, he lifted the silk sheet covering them appraising her figure and running his gaze across her. Draco bit his bottom lip and she could feel the effects that she was having on him as his hard length pressed firmly against her hip and pulled her in closer.“So Granger, what will it be?”“The tournament isn’t for another two days, so I’m sure there’s nothing wrong with staying here for a little while longer”. Hermione winked at Draco as he rolled on top of her pinning her to the mattress and began to kiss her passionately under the sheets.Dracos hands moved purposefully across her, caressing her curves- showing attention to her breasts, pinching at her tender nipples before he took one into his mouth, his tongue sliding up and around her peaked rosy flesh. She clutched at the sheets and arched into his body wanting more, a wave of need crashing over her as she grabbed at the back of his neck pulling him up to her and crashing her lips into his, exploring his mouth with her tongue.“I need you Draco, fuck me please” she said- he groaned against her lips as his hand shot down between her thighs and began to run circles across her clit.Her head rolled back to the mattress and she moaned at the sensitive contact- his fingers had slid to her slick entrance as he played with her- a torturous game that she desperately wanted to win. “Draco, please” she begged him, almost whining.He smirked into her neck and plunged a single long digit into her depth as she let out a guttural moan into the canopy of the bed. “Like that, Granger” he curled his finger and her hips jutted up meeting his enthusiasm.“Yes, fuck yes!” she gasped for breath as he slid a second finger in, pumping faster as her breathing became labored and needy. She let out tiny whimpers as she began to creep up closer and closer to the edge. “Cock” she moaned against the shell of his ear.He chuckled- “what was that Granger?” he started to slow his movements. She bit her lip and looked ferociously at him.“Draco Malfoy, you fuck me right now or so help me, I will leave you in this bed to tame Slytherines snake by yourself!”Draco looked at her for a moment, the grin faltered on his face as he got off her- she couldn’t fucking believe this! He was actually going to stop half way through! Her stomach sank as he went to the end of the bed. “What, where are you…?” she couldn’t finish her sentence.“This is what you wanted right?” he grabbed at her ankles before she could protest and dragged her body towards the edge. He clutched at her thighs and pushed them high parting her legs as his body pressed against them. Positioning himself at her center he ran his cock along her dripping cunt and she shuddered. “A good..” he pushed in and she almost squealed as he began a fast pace. “Hard!” He thrust harder into her and her eyes began to water, she felt herself tighten as he pistoned into her with force. “FUCK!” he called as she began to see white light erupting, her body began to shake and her legs quivered as he fucked her into the mattress. She was completely overcome as she let out a scream that could have been heard by the entire castle. ----------- Draco lay at the end of the bed top to toe with Hermione, both too legless to be able to move. From what he could tell she very much enjoyed when they got rough- his back was tingling from the red raw scratches he knew she had left just moments ago but he felt a swell of pride that he had brought her to that and she had marked him as hers.He grabbed at the sheet that had been discarded to the floor during their tryst and draped it over them as he heard a knock at the door. They both stiffened- fuck, someone had heard them.“Open up you prick, we need to get dressed for breakfast!” Blaise called from the other side of the door.“Come back later” Draco said as he smirked at Hermione.Theo piped in- “We’re in the same clothes from last night, otherwise we would just go down to breakfast. I smell like booze and cigarettes Draco. Open up”.“Fuck this” Blaise said as he unlocked the door and barged in.Draco sat up in the bed as the two boys took in the altered room around them, the beds transfigured, the clothing strewn across the floor and a completely naked Hermione covered by only a thin silk sheet.Draco looked down as he suddenly felt a cold breeze and realized she had snatched the sheets up to cover herself and he was now completely starkers. Scrambling for a pillow he quickly covered himself as the boys began to snigger in the doorway.“Looks like we are just in time for the show” Blaise said as he sauntered across the room to sit in the lounge chair by the unlit fireplace turning the chair to face the oversized bed.“Blaise, I will cut your fucking cock off if you don’t leave right now”. Draco said as he shot Theo a look of- get him the fuck out of here.Theo grinned and walked over to their trunks grabbing a handful of clothing before walking to the armchair- he bunched a handful of Blaises shirt collar and pulled him towards the door. Blaise left groaning through the doorway like he was about to miss the best party ever- well he kind of was.Theo stopped as he went to close the door and poked his head back in-“Yes Theo?” Hermione finally found her voice.“Don’t worry, we didn’t miss the ending to the last show- heard it as we walked up the stairs” he threw her a cheeky smile and wink before he closed the door behind him. Fuck.  -- Draco spent about twenty minutes trying to convince Hermione to go down to breakfast, it’s not that he didn’t want to stay up in the room with her the entire day- because he really fucking did- but they both desperately needed to eat.Apart from a few extremely inappropriate comments made by the guys at breakfast and Finnigan catching on to what had happened it wasn’t as bad as it could have been Draco decided. They finished up and Hermione parted to head for the library to meet some of the other Hogwarts students for some study.Draco walked across the hedge garden outside taking in the fresh air and contemplating what the next challenge could be when he was interrupted.“I hope you know what you’re doing Malfoy”. Ginny appeared from the edge of the rose garden. “You must realize how much she cares about you by now, has for a long time”.“I know”. He said to both comments. She walked closer.“She trusts you, that’s not an easy thing for her to do considering everything that’s happened”Draco wanted to try, he knew how much Ginny meant to Hermione- “sometimes I think that we are both just as fucked up as each other… I know what she’s going through, I want to help her through it”.Ginnys lip curved up slightly on one side, her face still as stone for the most part. “You know, I thought this was a complete cock up waiting to happen… maybe I was wrong…” the other side of her lip curved but still not quite a smile. “I still don’t like you, but I'll tolerate..”“How generous of you… truly. I guess now that you’re with Theo I will have to tolerate also”. They eyed each other, a battle of wills. “You hurt her Malfoy and there won’t be a ‘marry, fuck, kill’… it will just be ‘kill’”. She brought out the grin for that one. Draco nodded-“I wouldn’t expect anything less… Ginny” He said smirking, knowing full well that using her first name instead of ‘Weasley’ or an insult would throw her completely. She kept her composure as best she could but he could tell she was rattled by his pleasantries.Ginny turned without another word and walked back into the castle leaving Draco with his thoughts once again of what would be the next challenge for the Triwizard Tournament.
  
    Chapter Text
    The day had finally come for the second challenge, it had now been just over a month since they arrived in Paris and he stood in the Entry hall of Beauxbatons with Hermione in his arms as he said goodbye to her before they were ushered away.He could feel her shaking in his arms, she was as nervous as he was but he could hide it better.“You should go meet up with Ginny, she can sit with you throughout the challenge- make sure you have someone with you”.Blaise walked past and clapped Draco on the shoulder with his hand, didn’t say anything just looked somber and kept walking. Theo and Ginny walked over next and Draco nodded his head towards Hermione for Theo to see when her focus was taken. “Granger, why don’t you come in our carriage- we can all sit together?”Ginny caught on and gave Hermione a crushing hug before turning back towards the carriages. “Good luck Malfoy-” was all Ginny said, it was more than he was expecting from her. I guess you could call that progress.Hermione righted herself again, pulled out of a trance and turned back towards him, she placed her hand gently on his cheek and pressed up on her toes to kiss him softly. “Please be careful, come back to me not on a stretcher this time okay?” she said lightheartedly but with concern in her eyes.“I promise I will be careful-”He kissed her again, he didn’t need words to tell her how much he cared for her, what she meant to him. All he could do now was show her before she slipped away with the crowd. His breath caught as she grabbed the back of his neck and she intensified her longing kiss. Heat gathering around them as everything else was lost to the background.Grabbing at her waist he lifted her into his arms and held her tightly against him, she wrapped her legs around his hips. Probably not the best idea in the track pants he had on for the Tournament.Life came back around them as they could hear cheering and wolf whistles in the background. Prying their lips apart he found the entire Hogwarts student body gathered at the entry door waving signs and cheering on their Champion in his first endeavor for the day. Hermiones face became a beautiful flush of red as she realized their position and quickly scrambled to unwrap her legs and get to the ground while Dracos held the biggest grin he had possibly mustered in his life.McGonagall pursed her lips and looked away pretending not to notice their horribly inappropriate behavior for a school event.Bedazzled and glittered signs readying ‘MALFOY #1’ and ‘Slytherine Prince- Hogwarts King’ waved in the air of the crowd and Draco couldn’t help the swell of pride that rolled through him. He couldn’t believe that he could go from the most hated Hogwarts student to Hogwarts Champion in a matter of a month.McGonagall cleared her throat- which somehow was loud enough to drown out the crowd, and Draco let go of Hermione as she ran to meet her friends to catch the carriages. His Headmistress nodded her head towards him and then turned to round up the rowdy students.Draco was left in the entry hall by himself as the noise ceased once the giant Silver Oak doors were closed to the outside world.  ------------------------ “ROUND TWO” the great bellowing voice sounded from the large auditorium; they all sat huddled together in groups of schools watching large black screens. Hermione looked at her hands fidgeting in her lap as she picked at her nails and worried about what was about to happen. A small hands twined its way through hers and grounded her back into the moment.She looked up to see Ginnys smiling face- “he will be okay” she said trying to calm her. Theo leaned over Ginny and smiled softly towards Hermione- “you know how hard it is to off a Malfoy? This will be a piece of cake for him” he said before Ginny launched a fist at his arm.“Why in Godrics name would you say that you colossal prick?” Ginny whisper growled at Theo.“I am a colossal prick, or I have a colossal prick” he smirked slyly at her.“I knew it!” Hermione chuckled as Ginny blushed at being caught out. “Was I right in thinking it was the night of the Yule Ball then?” her eyebrows quirked as she took in Ginnys embarrassment and Theo smiled proudly.“Oh Gods Hermione, please don’t say anything to the boys…” Ginny buried her face in her hands. “Don’t get me wrong, it was amazing- IS amazing, I just don’t think Ron could handle the idea of me with a Slytherine”.“Even the head boy?” Theo teased playfully.“Well, I think it’s wonderful” Hermione said matter-of-factly. Ginny smiled sweetly to her friend and then Hermione decided to be slightly devious to take her mind of the challenge ahead. “So…” Ginny turned towards her again- “how was it then?”Ginny started coughing at the sudden intake of air she had made, Hermione began to laugh.“Hey now… I don’t ask Drake what you two get up to when commandeering our dorm room” Theo piped in.“No, you just show up unannounced and barge in” Hermione laughed as she could see Theos current uncomfortable nature.“You did not?!” Ginny turned on her boyfriend?“It was Blaises idea… I thought they would be down at breakfast by the time we got there”.Ginny eyed Theo suspiciously and rounded back on Hermione- “You and me- we will chat later, lots to discuss”. Ginny winked and turned back in her seat as the announcer began and Theo continued to argue the point of her not disclosing information of their sexual encounters- I wonder why, he is normally so open about everything.   --  She watched as the screens were brought to life, projecting the three Champions all lined up in the center of one screen each. The announcer boomed into the crowd as the second challenge was given to the Champions and the students watching.“Todays challenge is one to test your intelligence and magical abilities- not only that but your mind as well. Each of you have been placed outside of your respective schools castle, somewhere hidden inside is the key to your next challenge”.Hermione gazed at Dracos screen as he looked around and came face to face with the looming dark picture of Hogwarts behind him. It wasn’t the same picturesque beauty it always was; it was cold, dark and most definitely not the Hogwarts that they knew. Hermione could see the fear creep over Dracos face as he pictured the same idea that she had- Hogwarts under the reign of Voldemort.“As you enter the castle you will complete a range of tasks in different areas to be able to move ahead. These will not be easy, you must figure out what each location needs to progress. If you are able to find your key you will be transported back and will have completed the challenge”.The tense shoulders and clenched jaw were prominent when she watched him, his skin almost more pale than usual which was a feat in itself. Her heart was beating hard against her chest as she felt her stomach drop for Draco. He didn’t want to do this, she could tell. “Oh- and Champions, you will have all of your senses dulled for this round” the tiny man with the loud gruff voice said before the music began to start.Hermione saw as each member of the Triwizard tournament had their eyes slowly cloud over in a haze, Dracos eyes became a pool of silver that spanned further than his normal grey orbs. They were all suddenly disoriented as part of their eye site went, one by one they cautiously made their way towards the entrances of their dark and dingey castles. -------------------------------------
   
Dracos breath caught as he walked up the steps of the towering castle covered in darkness. Not to mention the fact that he had about fifty percent of his vision dulled over in a cloud of black. He could faintly hear the cheers of excitement behind him from the small screen he had been able to see of the announcer.He wondered if Hermione had been able to see him or if they were watching from a different vantage point. Gods he didn’t want to do this. Everything about this challenge reminded him of the battle of Hogwarts, what the castle would have looked like if the Dark Lord had of taken over instead of fallen. The crumbling façade was slowly coming apart as he ventured on. The grand oak doors looked like they were rotted through as he pressed gently against the wood grain.He tried to listen out for any semblance of a noise, any kind of whisper- something to tell him that he wasn’t completely alone in this giant castle, that he had someone watching out for him- but there was no sound.The grand entrance was completely bare- it held no tapestries, the statues had been removed and the once bright glow of torchlight was nowhere to be seen. He lifted his wand, “lumos” he called as light bathed the entryway- he could only see a faint glow directly ahead of him. He needed to find this key, and fast so he could get the fuck out of this horror castle and back to his witch.Crossing the cobblestone floors he barely registered his footsteps they were so faint. Draco strategically thought about where they would end up hiding the key, he did have one advantage to this challenge; he knew the castle inside and out from his constant skulking in sixth year. All of the secret passages, best hiding spots and places that the most valuable things are kept.Draco walked straight for the Great hall, he knew it would be too easy for them to put it front and center but it would be stupid not to check.He flung open the doors, not realizing his own strength with his ‘touch’ on the fritz- entered into the great spanning room and there was a muffled bang behind him as the old oaks closed in on themselves. The room lit up with a faint glow from the torches and Draco put his wand back to his side, never away- not knowing what would jump out of the shadows.The site before him was mountainous piles of freshly plated food spread across the four house tables and heads table, he could swear that he saw steam coming off a nearby plate but that wouldn’t be possibly with his current vision. His guarded stance was ever ready for attack as he processed the site before him.“A meal fit for a champion!” a loud voice projected through the Great hall.
  Was he meant to eat the food? No that was too easy. 
He thought back to what the announcer had said at the start of the challenge- ‘you must figure out what each location needs to progress’. So he needed a meal fit for a champion supposedly. Draco moved across to the Slytherine table and tripped on a bench as he rounded the corner- all of his senses dulled made him clumsy- what a fucking site this must be for everyone watching.He took up his usual spot at his house table and looked at the meal in front of him- one of his favorites. A large roasted quail sat atop the plate in front of him surrounded by vegetables. A King and his knights would sit to dinner and feast on roasted poultry. Quite fitting for a champions meal he thought.One bite of the bland as hell quail caused Draco to shudder- his touch dulled further and his eye site darkened slightly. Fuck- he got it wrong. So now he knew that wrong answers caused further dulling he had to be careful.He looked around at the hall and tried to pull apart the clue- the meal part was easy, he knew he had to eat food. ‘Fit for a champion’- what would a champion eat? Where would they eat?At the head of the table.Draco turned to the head of the Slytherines table- no, they didn’t care about houses. He needed to be the head of the Great hall… The only position worthy of a champion was to sit at the head of the school. Raising from his seat he walked towards the Heads table, he passed the end and went straight for Headmistress McGonagalls chair in the center.There was an array of different deserts and treats on the table in front of him. How was he meant to know which to eat? He leant over the table and picked up a small fork before plunging it into the pumpkin pie in front of him. Before he took the piece into his mouth he hesitated; this wasn’t his meal, he was the champion was he not?The realization dawned on him as he dropped the fork laden with pie and reached for the crisp green apple nestled between some plump grapes and a banana to the side. He bit into the deliciously sweet fruit and he could hear the loud noise of the skin breaking beneath his teeth- loud noise?Suddenly the rooms contents vanished- tables left bare, the light had returned to a dimly lit candlelight and Draco held the glorious victory apple in the palm of his hand. He had completed the first room with only one fault. With no key in site it was time to progress.  --  It was completely unnerving walking through the castle at night with not one living or dying soul in site. Almost pitch black hallways caused Dracos heart to pound against his rib cage as he steadily walked on. He knew this was a time sensitive task but he couldn’t move past the hatred and death he had seen in these hallways, the blood that marred these walls- terrible monsters hid in dark corners.His next stop was the Library, Gods was he nervous that would turn into a shit fight. After wandering aimlessly for around twenty minutes he realized that nothing was going to happen and therefore the key was most definitely not in there. He continued on; thanking Salazar that he was checking off the bigger rooms without any issues.The trophy room was definitely one that he thought may contain the key; a room full of past and present Champions of Hogwarts- something coveted, to be a winner for once, that's what he always wanted. As he ventured through the glass doorway they sealed shut behind him binding a red glow across the glass. Blinding lights began to haze his already faulted eyes. Like giant glass orbs shattering in front of him from different angles. It was debilitating how bright they were, then the noise came- bellowing cheers and yelling from all angles, piercing his eardrums as they became louder and louder. He cowered into a corner of the room as his senses were sent into overdrive with the sudden onslaught.“Fuck!” he yelled over the noise- “stop!” He was almost begging. His mind racing, trying to think of a way to stop the light and noise. He closed his eyes but he could still see the illuminations just as bright as before. “Think” he said to himself as he tried to dull again; what does the room want. It’s a trophy room. It wants trophies and prizes; people winning. It wants champions.A split moment of clarity pushed him to his feet as he found a table close to where he was. Hoisting himself up onto the table he lifted his arms into the air and started to cheer with the loud cries- He had to feel it too. He thought about winning the Triwizard Tournament, holding the cup above his head. His pride at being Hogwarts Champion and changing his name from one of shame to something of greatness. Being the man that deserved his witch.The blazing lights in the room stopped flashing, the cheering and calls ceased- he was plunged into darkness once again as his labored breathing slowed and the adrenalin started to ease pumping through his veins.He didn’t know how much of this he would be able to take-Continuing on he looked through Charms classrooms, Dueling; where he battled a rush of about one hundred extremely unpleasant pixies- on his fucking own! Finally he decided to try for the dungeons- it was one of the last places to look.He wasn’t nervous for this; his interests had always been in potions. If anything were to be easy for him today it would be if he had to brew a potion.The muted dungeon door creaked open and he strolled inside. It wasn’t like the other classrooms; either completely empty and void of any interest in the Tournament or full and he was quickly locked in.No the door stayed ajar as he walked through the room, taking in all the different potions and vials on the benches, the cauldron sitting on a simmering flame with no contents. Draco wasn’t sure what he needed to do for this task so he continued to take in his surroundings. The small potions cabinet was open to the side of the room but nothing drew him in there.He went to pick up a large vial of Daisyroot serum that sat on a side bench- the force from his fingers grasping heavily against the glass caused it to shatter in his hand. The glass slashed at his skin and his hand began to bleed heavily.“Episkey” Draco called as he aimed his wand at his hand- nothing happened. "Vulnera Sanentur" he said- he learnt that one after Snape used it for his Sectumsempra curse. Still nothing happened, the wound would not close, it continued to gush dark red as his concern grew.
  This is a potions classroom- the location wants me to use a potion to heal. 
He raced for the potions cabinet and steadily with gentle fingers plucked at a few vials and items that he would need to create Murtlap Essence- he stalled on his way out and turned back to grab a number of other items- blood replenishing potion, based on how much blood his had already lost he thought he would definitely need one to continue on.His hands were sticky and wet as he fumbled through the items, most of the labels had been covered slick with crimson and he had to make out what they were by bringing them fully up to his face and squinting to take in the dark label.The simmering cauldron was transfigured into two as his wand finally decided it wanted to fucking work- thanks a lot! And he began on the two complex potions that would normally take him the better part of half a day to brew. Sadly he didn’t have that time afforded.Quick and precise measurements were spooned and poured into the mixture as he finely cut a large amount of pickled tentacles for the Murtlap. He was hoping that the added ingredient of his blood was not going to affect the potion as he was fairly sure about half a liter had already gone into the mix.His head began to swirl and his hands started to shake as he felt the effects of blood loss. Not knowing if he would make it he hurried his pace, there was a fine line between a successful potion and completely bollocksing one up. The desk Draco was working on was almost completely covered in his blood as he drew closer to the end of the brew.Draco felt a sudden rush to his head as he collapsed to his knees- he estimated that by now he was close to having lost a fatal amount and he didn’t want to wait around for the moment when he blacked out and didn’t wake back up.The wand on the counter began to buzz signaling the completion of his Murtlap Essence. He got to his feet and ladled a small amount into a cup quickly drinking it, the wound stitched itself together and closed completely- now for the blood replenishing.He leant back against the wall behind him waiting on bated breath, his eyes were closing, his limbs were heavy with exhaustion, he had at least stopped bleeding- but was it in time? His vision went blank- completely. He could feel himself dropping to the ground and hearing a dull thud as his head hit cobblestone. The sensation wasn’t cold- he couldn’t feel the cool stone beneath him but he knew that’s what it should be.His mind blurred, he could feel the faint beat of his heart in his ears- it was slow.
  Was this it? Was this how he would die? In some fucking contest, trying to impress people he didn’t even like- attempting to revive his family name for what? He didn’t even give a fuck what his parents thought of him anymore, he didn’t need their approval. No, he did this for himself. He did this for her. Hermione. She was the only person he cared for, cared what she thought and how she saw him. He was doing this to prove that he was good enough- he never had been before. He had to do this for her. 
His eyes flew open to a sideways glance at the dungeon floor as he gracelessly stumbled to his knees, this would have to do for now.The cauldron was close enough to the edge that he was able to grab at the sides of it and pull it off the desk. The smell of burning flesh enveloped the dim room and he realized that it must have been a lot worse than what he could smell. He had completely taken a layer of skin from his hand retrieving the cauldron. His ladle was brought out and he quickly drank the Blood replenishing potion. His head stopped spinning and his overall body perked at the sudden restoration.Draco got to his feet steadily and took another sip of the Murtalp to heal his hand and the dungeon door went from slightly open to fully open. He had completed the challenge and needed to move on. Before he left the room there was a loud noise that sounded- “the key you seek will look to the stars”.
  Fuck. 
He knew exactly where they had put the key. It was the one place he had prayed to Salazar he would not have to go.The Astronomy Tower. --  Dracos heart was pounding as he climbed the stairs to the tower, not because of the strenuous climb- because of where he was going.He hadn’t been back up to the Astronomy Tower since the day that Dumbledore had been killed and he had been to blame. He was the reason that the Death Eaters had penetrated the schools grounds- he was the reason that Dumbledore was found and killed by Snape. It was his fault.The plan was to finish off his school year never going near that fucking tower ever again- now he had to go there with a literal thousand students and the entire wizarding world watching him.Last few steps before he needed to face his demons- his hand paused on the handle to the door as he thought back to the last time he had done this. The day that he had truly ruined his and many other peoples’ lives. His hand was shaking, he could feel his stomach in his throat as he turned the handle.The room opened out into a large spanning dome, complete darkness covered- how fitting.Draco held his wand higher but he was struggling to even cast a bright enough ‘lumos’ to light his way with the heavy weight on his heart. His gaze wandered around what little he could see of the room and he couldn’t see anything resembling a key. He knew it would be up here though- it had to be.What had the clue said- ‘the key you seek will look to the stars’.
  How literal were they being here?
Draco looked at the roof of the tower and saw nothing. But you wouldn’t see the stars if you were inside would you?The balcony was small and confined, he cautiously inched himself to the very side of it and leaned teetering over the edge looked up to the top of the roof- his vision immediately came back as it focused in on a gold glinting key fastened to the spire. He could hear the faint rumbles from below of cheering as he closed in on the finish. All of his senses back and all he had to do now was climb.Draco knew his wand wouldn’t work, that would have been too easy- he didn’t even bother trying. He fastened his wand into his pocket and grabbed hold of the intricate framework that wound its way up to the roof of the Astronomy tower and pulled himself up.The higher that he climbed the brighter that the sky became, once completely darkness had now turned into almost like a sunrise. He moved closer and climbed higher. His footing sure and precise making sure that he would not fall.
  Don’t you fucking dare look down.
He was almost there, his blood pumping, heart racing, senses on fire as he neared the end. The wind was whipping his hair across his face and his eyes were watering from the strain. Only a few inches away, he reached out and his hand clasped onto the golden key left in the freezing elements causing a shiver to run up his spine.Instantly he was transported to a spanning auditorium where the stands were set up and there was erupting applause and cheers from everyone.Draco saw Elouise out of the corner of his eye and she smirked at him. He couldn’t help the smile that drew across his face- she did say she wasn’t going to take it easy on him this round.For now though- he would stand there, basking in the cheers and shouts of those that had watched him perform for the Triwizard cup. There was a small pop and Emil had found his way back to the stands- he looked completely disheveled and like he had seen a thousand ghosts but Draco didn’t have much time to take his appearance in. He was almost ploughed over by a hard object barreling into him.Hermione had run from the stands and hurled herself into Draco- tears were streaming down her pink cheeks and she carried a look of worry but relief. She had been scared for him. Draco wrapped his arms around her waist, leant down and kissed her right there, in front of the crowds of people- in front of the media- in front of the entire wizarding world.
  He didn’t care who saw- all he cared about was her.

  
    Chapter Text
    ‘The Death Eaters Golden Girl’. Hermione threw the newspaper across the breakfast table with disgust.
“I can’t believe they would write such tripe”. Hermione was red in the face as she scolded her third paper for the day. Draco sat beside her chuckling to himself. “How can you be laughing about this Draco. The things that they have written about you… about us…” she looked down at her cereal and Draco felt his heart drop.
“It doesn’t matter what they say, we know what the truth is and that’s all that matters”.
“Draco, witch weekly said that you sometimes wear your Death Eater robes and mask when we have sex”.
Dracos face dropped as he took in what she said and began grabbing at the newspaper to read the article. Blaise sat down pulling at some toast as he smirked at Draco. “Seen the one yet about Granger making you call her the ‘The Dark Lady’” Blaise couldn’t help the laugh that came out.
“Here I thought they were meant to be reporting on the Tournament, not your love life” Ginny sat down next to Hermione with Theo in toe.
Hermione hugged Ginny good morning- Hermione may have stayed somewhere else last night instead of her dorm.
“Okay, new rule...” Theo called out- “If Granger is staying in our room now I get to stay in with Ginny- I’m sick of sleeping on a sodding couch in the commons. My body can’t take it anymore”.
Hermione blushed furiously. She hadn’t been able to help herself; she went to Dracos room late after they had all come back from the challenge and when he opened the door in only his boxers she lost it. Only going there to give him a goodnight kiss had ended in Draco yelling at the two boys to ‘get the fuck out’ before he slammed the door behind them with Hermione climbing him like a bloody tree.
Ginny and Padma agreed that they were okay with the trade off- “Hold on- why does Draco get to have a room to himself and we have to share?” Theo countered. “You guys can have Blaise and the other girls some nights”.
“I’m not a fucking dog Theo! You can’t just palm me off to stay with someone else so you can dip your tip”. Blaise joked then quickly called out in pain as Theo reached over and punched him in the arm. Draco began to laugh at the general conversation and the whole table stopped to watch him- it had been a bloody long time since he had laughed, even longer in front of those that weren’t his inner circle. Hermione grabbed hold of his hand under the table and gripped tightly- she felt content and happy for the first time since the war had begun.
Their conversation continued as they all ate together, Elouise joined them with a few of her friends and Blaise immediately made room and was quickly berated by Padma for his flirting in front of her.
Beauxbatons had brought out an entirely new side to Hermione and her friends, had anyone asked her two months ago whether she would be sitting down to breakfast with Slytherines and laying in bed at night with Draco fucking Malfoy she would have told them they were absolutely crazy- but here she was, doing just that.
Neville entered the conversation clutching an envelope in his hand- “Hermione, it’s for you. McGonagall gave it to me to pass on”.
Hermione reached for the letter and immediately recognized the clumsy scrawl addressing the off white envelope to her. Harry.
“Oh dear” she said quietly.
Draco leaned over- “everything okay?”
“Just about to have my arse handed to me via post- nothing to be too worried about” she smiled weakly as Draco stared at the envelop trying to decipher who it may be from. “Harry” she answered his unasked question.
He hummed quietly, “maybe you should take this somewhere else?” She began to realize how well Draco actually knew her and the fact that how Harry reacted to the news of her and Draco would certainly cause her to break down whether good or bad.
Hermione got to her feet and began a slow and torturous walk back towards her dorm, she made it to the stairs looking directly at the letter before she registered that Draco was following her. “You don’t have to…” she started-
“I know, I want to…”
They silently walked into her room and she slid her fingers between the closed folds of paper opening the letter. Her breath hitched as she took in the words before her.
 

  Hermione,


   


  I was surprised to read the paper this morning considering the front page picture that met me. I am fully aware that the life you have at Hogwarts without Ron and I being there must be difficult, however I never imagined that you would turn to Malfoy for comfort. I feel it necessary to remind you of how much of a git he was to you...


   

She rolled her eyes and scoffed. Draco walked around the room before settling behind her to read over her shoulder.  
 

  Bullying you every year since we started at Hogwarts, calling you names and making you feel like you were less of a witch because of your blood. Hermione, he is a giant prick! I don’t know how far this has gone but I hope that you see sense very soon-


  We will be coming to Beauxbatons the day before the final challenge to see you, Ron and I have both been given leave- I wish that you would understand me when I tell you this is a very bad idea, seeing Malfoy, this petty infatuation you hold needs to end. Ron has already destroyed half of our apartment in a rage after hearing about this.


   


  We will see you on Thursday,


  Harry.

 
Hermione put down the letter, she tried to steady her breathing as she digested his words. How could he be so cruel, he had fought for acceptance for all people and now that Draco had changed his ideals and beliefs that should include him too. She sighed as she dropped her hands with the letter.
Draco cleared his throat- “Well he got one thing right”- Hermione turned towards him and paused for Dracos explanation as a wild grin crossed his steady features- “the part about the giant prick”. Hermione couldn’t help herself; she let out a loud barking laugh and shook her head while rolling her eyes sarcastically- she couldn’t hide the stray tear that rolled down her cheek.
“You’re not doing yourself any favors you know” her face slowly saddened.
“Granger, Potter and Weasley have hated me since first year- do you really think that after everything that has happened they would be happy about me putting my giant prick even remotely near you?”
Hermione gave a weak smile in understanding- “I know, I just thought that maybe they could- just for once, believe that I know what I am doing and trust my judgment. I just wish they would see it differently and be happy for me”. Her face was down trodden, she sighed deeply and placed her hands over her face as she fell onto the creaking bed in a heap of curls and sadness.
Draco couldn’t have that, he never wanted to see his witch sad again. Crossing in front of her he leant by the bedside. “Hermione, they will come around- just as you did, it will just take time”.
She sat up looking him in his steely grey eyes and the corner of her lips turned up slightly. She nodded her head slightly- defeated.
“Come on Granger, lets head down to see what the plan is for the day”. Draco grabbed at Hermiones hand and pulled her from the bed, gathering her into his arms he pressed a chaste kiss to her lips before they left the safety of the room behind.
 
--------------------
 
With only two days left till the final challenge Hermione pondered what would happen once they returned to Hogwarts. Would things go back to the way that they were before? Would Draco still feel the same once they left the romantic countryside of Paris?
She had found a secluded bench in a small flourishing garden of the grounds to sit and read her favorite book. The concrete cold to her touch but the sunlight beaming through the trees bathed her in warmth. The closest tree blossomed tiny fuchsia flowers and scented the air with a delicately sweet fragrance.
Hermione had grown accustom to her time at Beauxbatons; the beautiful scenery, the new sense of adventure in the unknown surroundings, amazing foods- but mostly she was growing to love the person that she had become while in Paris. If it weren't for the most important people in her life being in London she would move to Paris in a heartbeat. All of the decisions she had made leading up to now caused her to smile to herself as she plucked a beautiful flower from the tree.
Her mind wandered to the possibilities of the future but the here and now kept her mind in the present- constantly appreciating this new life that she had made for herself. She had made this all for herself, no one to dictate how she should live or who she should love. Making a vow to herself then and there that she would do everything in her power to follow her heart and make her decisions based on what she wanted and no one else.
Folding the petals into a page she squeezed firmly on the cover of Emma- Jane Austen and pressed the flower into her book to dry and treasure. Her moment in time, a revelation as she sat in this garden. Something for her.

   

--
 
Hermione walked back into the castle and made her way up the stairs to the dorms, she could hear hushed tones echoing only slightly off the walls of the hallway near the divide between the girls and boys dorms. When she rounded the corner she stopped abruptly when she spied the familiar platinum hair of her lover- he was speaking angrily towards Blaise as he brandished a small letter.
Blaises muffled voice came towards her and she thought she heard him say- “Draco they’re your parents”.
Hermiones breath caught in her throat at the thought of something occurring with Dracos parents. Not only had she assisted in the capture of his father and his subsequent imprisonment in Azkaban she had also assisted in clearing Draco and his mothers names when their trials occurred. She wasn’t really sure where she would stand when it came to the two older Malfoys. Hermione slowly inched her way behind a marble statue to the side of the walkway to conceal herself.
“How can they let this happen” she heard Draco say- “they are meant to be on house arrest”.
Had Mister and Missus Malfoy escaped somehow?
“All I know is that you better figure out what you want and quickly before old father dearest decides for you”. Blaise began to walk off towards the other end of the hallway as Draco called out to stop him.
“I want her!” he called as sure as the wind blows and the sun rises. Hermione could feel her heart almost beating out of her chest as she gripped the cool marble next to her grounding herself before she floated away. He was referring to her-
Blaise turned around to face him with a grin- “I knew you would- get ready for a whole shit storm Drake” he said before he walked away.
Hermione turned and hurried back to her room where she collapsed on the bed- her mind whirling and her heart thrumming with excitement as she contemplated how much she really meant to him that he would choose her over what his parents wants. What exactly would that mean for him?
  
    Chapter Text
    Standing on the tough and rigid cobblestone she waited for the boys to arrive. It had taken her most of the morning to psych herself up for the confrontation she was about to have- she knew it was coming and there was no other way around it.
Dressed in her crisp white button-up and pleated skirt she let the warmth of the sun wash over her. The Gryffindor tie adorning her neck had been tied and re-tied about one hundred times in nervous anticipation for what was to come. Draco stood beside her and clasped her hand tightly in his, a show of support as she fidgeted and fiddled until a loud sounding ‘gong’ rattled the foundations signaling twelve o’clock for lunch.
There was a loud crack of apparition and two small figures landed in the fields far from the castle. Hermione immediately recognized the shock of red hair bobbing in the distance close to a tuft of dark hair. Excited anticipation crossed her mind before it was quickly overtaken by the impending dread once again.
Draco squeezed harder against her hand and she slowed her breathing. Even after this short time, he already knew her better than anyone-
“Granger, it will be fine- just give them time and they will come around”.
She bounced on the balls of her toes as they drew nearer, they had gained quite a speed- she had a quiet confidence that maybe they were just as excited to see her as she was to see them. Ron was almost at the bottom of the steps in front of Harry as Hermione let go of Dracos hand ready to envelop her boys in a hug…
Veering around her, Ron headed straight for Draco- before anyone knew what was happening he had swung a fist forward and collided heavily with Dracos face. Hermione heard a crunching sound as Draco fell to his knee in front of her.
Absolutely livid- “Ronald Bilius Weasley! How dare you raise a fist to him. I don’t care what grudges you have they end today, or so help me you will never see me again!” Hermione had moved herself in between the two men and was pushing Rons heaving chest as she yelled in his face.
“Granger leave it, I knew it would happen at least once today- at least we can get it out of the way early on”. Draco stood shakily to his feet as Hermione tried to help steady him.
Harry had now joined them on the stone landing and stood back slightly. “I suppose you knew he was going to do that” Hermione said towards Harry. Harry shrugged his shoulders and looked towards the ground.
“Right- lets have at it then. Get it over and done with so we can all move on” Hermione said to the boys in front of her. That’s right, boys- that’s how they were acting after all.
“What you want us to hash it out right now, in front of the entrance hall?” Harry groaned.
“Lets go then” Ron had finally found his voice. However she didn’t think that him speaking would help the situation right now. “You are lower than fucking scum Malfoy, an absolute piece of worthless shit on our boots. There is no way you will ever deserve Hermione and we will make sure that she doesn’t end up with you as much as she has deluded herself into thinking she cares for you now- it won’t last”.
Harry chimed in- “yeah! A death eater could never be with our Hermione, you don’t deserve her Malfoy”
“Are you quite done-” Hermione began, but was cut off abruptly by Draco grabbing her elbow and walking slightly in front of her.
“I know” he said- both boys looked at each other in confusion as Draco agreed with their statements. Draco continued into the silence- “I know I don’t deserve her and I probably never will. We all know how amazing she is- but if Hermione thinks there is even some hope for me to be the man that she deserves then I will try my hardest to be that for her. I can’t change anything that I have done, I can’t alter the past and all of the horrid things I did to her and others, but I can try and make it up to her and show her how perfect she is each and every day from here on”.
Hermione turned towards him to take in his proclamation. This man, her man was bearing his heart to her two best friends in hopes that they will accept him for who he is and then move on. The sincerity that crossed his face was a site she had never wanted more. He was beautiful- she was in awe. 
Draco kept his eyes on the two boys- weary of the possibility of another outburst. His cheek red and swollen, a purple mark forming under his eye which was now watering and bloodshot. Hermione thought he probably had a broken cheekbone-
She turned her attention back to Ron and Harry and scolded them once again- she was ruthless in her verbal punishment. Bringing up every persons right for a fair chance in the wizarding world and their fight to make it happen. All of those souls lost in the war for hope of a better future. Ron stayed silent as Harry shifted on the spot not knowing how to answer.
Finally Harry seemed to huff in defeat at her reasoning- “McGonagall is waiting inside- she organized lunch for us in the dining hall”. Ron pushed past Draco in a huff and walked inside. “We will be watching Malfoy, if you hurt her you will have to answer to us”. Harry walked around Hermione and Draco to follow his friend.
Hermione turned towards Draco and he saw a shimmer of a tear pooling- she threw her arms around his neck pulling him down to her. Her tense shoulders released as she melted into his embrace and she let out a small sigh as her body shuddered under his.
“So, that went better than I had anticipated”, Draco chuckled into her bushy mane as she clung to him tighter.
“I can’t believe Ron punched you”.
“Hey, I’m just thankful it was only Weasley and not Potter as well”. Draco loosened his grasp and slid his hands down to her hips holding her in place- “lets go and get some food- maybe after a meal things will have settled down”.
Hermione grabbed at Dracos hand- “we need to go to the matron fist. I’m fairly sure that your cheekbone is broken”. She brushed her hand gently along his protruding, red cheek and he flinched at the contact realizing the pain that shot through his face after the adrenaline had worn off. Hermione walked with him towards the entrance doors and he smiled quietly to himself- one obstacle down with Weasley and Potter, only his parents to go. The rest of the world can go fuck themselves.

   

-----------------------
 
Lunch had been an awkward moment at best- not only had both Weasley and Potter refused to address him, they went out of their way to pretend that he didn’t exist at all. Hermione had continued to try and sway their preconceived notions towards him to no avail. The rest of the Hogwarts students were eager to catch up with the two Aurors in training and find out what it was like in life after Hogwarts but they also made time to show support in their acceptance of Draco.
Theo and Ginny had opted to sit elsewhere for lunch but Theo continued to glance over towards Draco in show of support, Blaise had outright commented that ‘if they had a problem with him then they could both fuck right off’. Draco had covered his face with his hand and flushed slightly at his friends over the top attempt at support of the couple. He appreciated it, but it was a little much.
The meal came to a close and McGonagall addressed the group to let the two visitors know that they would be sharing accommodation with Dean and Seamus in the boys dorms for the night- fuck. That was right next to Dracos room. No more sleep overs for Hermione or Ginny.
The night proved to be a cold and lonely one as Draco settled in with only his thoughts as company. Tomorrow would be the final challenge in the Triwizard Tournament- he rolled to his side and felt the cold empty space beside him where Hermione would normally lay. Of all the nights to spend alone and sleepless this was by far the worst timed. He sighed into his pillow and willed sleep to take him. Anticipation creeping into his mind at every turn and the worry of what tomorrow had in store for the Hogwarts Champion.
  
    Chapter Text
    The sun rose over the mountains beaming light into the castle, Hermione gazed out her window as she woke to the sound of song birds and the gentle gust of wind. Stretching her legs and arms to ease the poor nights sleep she had- sleep did not come easy without Draco next to her it seemed, she slowly sat up around her covers.Her movements stirred Ginny in the bed next to hers- “didn’t sleep well either?” Ginny whispered as she opened her eyes sleepily to stare at Hermione.“No, it seems foreign to not have him next to me-”“I know what you mean, it’s only been a short amount of time but it feels like a part of me is missing. I can’t seem to chase away the nightmares without Theo beside me” Ginny shifted staring at the room.“Every time I close my eyes I see the war, it only seems to ease when we are together. I don’t know what will happen when we return to Hogwarts. Ginny, I don’t know what I will do if we go back to the way we were before”. Hermione sighed sadly as she contemplated. Her bed was warm but any shift seemed to bring a sudden coldness, a loneliness that she longed to have filled by gentle hands and a warm pale body holding her tightly.“The way he looks at you Hermione, there’s no way he could ever go back to the way you were before”. Ginny sat up on her elbows and looked at Hermione from her bed. “He loves you-“Hermione smiled sweetly towards her- “Theo does too”.Ginny beamed, “I know”.There was a quiet tapping at their window and Ginny hurried over to meet the small brown owl that had a tiny roll of paper attached to its leg. “It’s from Draco” she said as she unrolled the parchment. “He wants you to meet him when you wake up- in the rose garden… he’s so fucking sweet Min!”Hermione blushed and squealed into her pillow. “I better get dressed then”.She hurried down the stone steps out into the entrance way. The cold air filtered into the towering hall as she flittered across the marble and pushed at the polished oak doors into the crisp morning sun. Draco was standing at the entrance of the garden with a yellow peony – beautiful and blossoming in the warm light that reflected the brightness of the sun. He leaned against the archway with one foot crossed over the other and his back pressed against the wooden frame. Clothes perfectly pressed and tight fitting to show off his immaculate muscle structure. All those years of Quidditch had been kind to him. The slight shine to his pale skin and the brightness of his platinum hair sent Hermiones nerves alight and she studied him like she would an old tomes she had coveted from an antient library. Gods he was fucking gorgeous.Draco must have heard her steps, he inclined his head and stared at her as she came near- a smile lighting up his handsome face. He looked at her as though she were everything to him, and she felt like she was.“Morning beautiful”, he pushed himself off the arch to saunter over and meet her. His hand outstretched as he offered her the sweet floral in his hand. “It’s been a while since I gave you the last one- have to step up my game”. He smirked at her and she giggled…. She giggled… bloody hell she was toast.He leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to her lips and held out his hand for her to take as he led them into the rose garden. They had made it a short distance in silence before he sighed and clasped her hand tighter in his. “I need to tell you something”. He looked over to her and Hermiones stomach dropped, not knowing what he might have to say.“I need to leave for the challenge in two hours- but I had to get this out now…”Her throat was dry and she tried to swallow the lump in her throat as she waited in silence for him to spit out what he was trying to say. She nodded her head in encouragement.He looked up to the sky, like he was trying to force it out of his mouth. “The ministry have brought my parents here.. for the tournament finale. It’s custom that the family of the Champions attend the final challenge. The ministry have granted them approval without my knowledge. I thought you should know that they will be here today- within the hour in fact”. He stopped in his tracks and looked down to her, gauging her reaction to the news he had just dropped on her.“Oh…” was all she could manage. She had thought that it would be something worse but this still was a shock. “Are you happy that they are here?” she asked quietly.“Well… they are my parents, I just haven’t seen them in so long. I’m not really sure how they will react to…” He paused as he tried to string together his words.Hermione cut him off- “how they will react to me”.Draco looked forlorn and his gaze shot to the ground. “yes”.“I guess that’s something we will just have to get through together”. She placed her hand on his cheek and angled his face back up to look at her. His piercing grey eyes sparkled with blue flecks in the light- he looked lost, unsure… did he not know what he wanted?“You are worried about how they will react to us being together-” Draco nodded his head. She took a steadying breath as she prepared herself for the next question and what his answer may be. “Draco, what happens if they say you can’t be with me?”His silence echoed through the garden- he stilled at her touch and looked deeply into her eyes.“I don’t care what they say- I have fought enough for what everyone else wants, Hermione I just want to be happy for once in my life. That happiness is with you”. Draco ran his fingers through her curled hair and settled at the nape of her neck. A smile crossing his lips.“My happiness is with you too Draco” she smiled at him as her memory returned her realization the other day on the bench in the garden- this was what she wanted, to do something for herself for once, make a decision that made her happiest. He made her the happiest.“I love you Hermione” Draco leant in ghosting his lips against hers. “I love you too”, she whispered across his breath. Her hands pulled at the collar of his shirt bringing his lips to hers- colliding in love and lust as they put all of their meaning into the one motion. Draco held her tightly against his body as they wandered and explored, already knowing each others bodies and what they both craved. Hermione could feel the familiar buzz of her core crying out to be sated and the undeniable tightening of Dracos pants against her body as their kiss deepened.The distant sound of students wandering the gardens began to filter through into their little bubble and they knew this wasn’t the right time or place for such desires they both were having in that moment. Draco stepped back but left his hand on her hip as he grinned sweetly towards her. “Lets go get this over with, shall we?” Draco asked and Hermione nodded her head. -------- The room they had allocated for the circumstances surrounding Dracos parents was large enough to house Hermione and Draco, Dracos parents and an Auror team of five. Stationed at the two separate doorways to the room they sectioned off the exits so ensure compliance and any escape routes covered. The tension in the air was palpable- the four non-ministry appointed staff sat at the square table in the center of the room. Not one word had been uttered since Draco had entered with Hermione in tow. Narcissa Malfoy had glared daggers at the young witch and Lucius’ gaze had followed his son upon his entry and had not yet left him.Draco cleared the silence- “let’s just lay it on the table shall we”.“My, my son- straight to business without a proper greeting, have you learnt nothing from me?” Lucius drawled in a sarcastic tone slithered with spite. His father was the picture of aristocratic snobbery and Hermione grasped Dracos hand tightly at hearing his voice. Draco just scoffed at Lucius' feeble attempt at baiting him into a fight.“You obviously know that Hermione and I are together from the papers- I don’t see why it needs to be a topic of discussion. Are we not here for the Triwizard Tournament after all?” Draco could feel his blood rising at the notion he had to even justify his relationship to his parents. His mother stayed silent, her bleary grey eyes piercing through Hermione where she sat.“We know it’s just a phase Draco, in the eyes of the public it might just be the stunt we need to gain our family name back and return to social standings. Once this is all over you will continue to work towards the head as the Malfoy heir and find a nice pureblood wife to marry and breed”. Lucius emphasized his last words as his eyes lazily scanned over Hermione and then straight back to his son as if she was a worthless thought in his mind. So they weren't going to discuss the tournament then?“I will do no such thing father. This is my life- I will make the decisions that I want to make and I will love whomever I choose to”. Draco thumped his fist on the table in front of his father and Narcissa cringed at his use of the ‘L’ word. “Believe me, this is no stunt. I am in love with Hermione and I will continue to love her for as long as she will allow me”.Dracos mother looked paler than usual and began to sway slightly on her chair as though she might faint. Lucius’ jaw tensed at his sons disrespect towards him as head of the Malfoy family. “Mark my words boy, this Mudblood is nothing- she will chew you up and spit you out before you even know what hit you. Malfoys do not sully themselves with dirt”.Draco could feel his hands shaking, the pulse thumping through his neck as he tried to steady himself at his next words- “I would sooner give up the Malfoy name than leave behind the greatest thing that has ever happen to me”. He stood abruptly from the chair causing the auror party to falter at the sudden movement. Draco turned and began to walk towards the door with Hermiones hand in his.He stopped short and looked back towards his mother- “I will not give her up, this family has already taken so much from me. I only want to be happy”. His mothers gaze faltered at his softly spoken harsh words and she clasped her hands together tightly in her lap, sadness covering her features as she watched her son leave without saying goodbye.

    Dracos nerves were shot, he had been running over and over in his mind what he could be facing today and what he needed to do to get through it. He couldn’t care less about winning the Tournament, he just wanted to finish and move on with his life- with Hermione by his side.Ushered into a small dark room he was distracted by the limited items of memorabilia, tiny shining trophies and frameless mediocre portraits that were huffing and covered in dust from being locked away without an audience for what seemed a very long time. The other two champions were already in the room; Emil sitting in a small armchair looking about as pleasant as the portrait occupants and Elouise stood near the corner looking at a particularly intricate gold medallion hanging from a hook on the wall.Elouises’ fingers caressed the soft edges as she brushed her thumb across the writing displayed. Draco walked over to meet her as he had no interest in engaging in conversation with Emil- “ready for the finale?” he said as he leaned against the wall.Elouise looked at him carefully- “I am… so long as the big oaf doesn’t win the cup I will be a happy woman”. She looked back to the medallion and smiled. “This was my grandmothers, she won it during dueling championships almost fifty years ago”.Draco looked closer at the shining inscription- Aliera  Moreau
  Champion Duelist

  Beauxbatons Academy

  1954

   
“Is this a scare tactic” Draco chuckled- “because it’s fucking working”.Elouise laughed heartily and the nerves in the room dissipated slightly at the humor, Emil continued his sulking in the corner. Draco leant in closer so that only Elouise could hear, “There is no way in hell I would let that halfbreed giant take home the cup- I would rather it remain on French soil”.“That can be arranged” Elouise winked at Draco as he stepped back.“We will have to wait and see”. Draco retorted, sitting down in the remaining chair and waited patiently. There was no sound permeating through the walls, no indication of crowds of people cheering for their champions and school- only a daunting feeling of unrest and danger ever present in Dracos life thus far. What he would give for  even a single moment of normal, a second a peace. Being able to see the sites of Paris with the woman he loves and not a care in the world about who he was or what he had done. He would live for that moment.Lost in thought of the future he could have if only he made it through the final challenge, he would be able to whisk Hermione away and never let her go.He realized it had been just shy of an hour- a small door appeared in the wall of the room and there was a loud announcement calling forth Elouise Moreau. The Beauxbatons Champion walked slowly towards the hidden door, diverting just as she came close to Draco. She wrapped her arms around him for a quick embrace- “good luck Malfoy, be safe” she said as she walked through the doorway and darkness encased her.“You too” Draco said quietly after her. ---------------- Hermione watched on in nervous anticipation as the giant stadium was transformed before her eyes into what looked like a gladiator arena. It was as big as the Quidditch pitch from the world cup and had just as much seating set out for the students, families and anyone else that wanted to attend the final challenge that decided the winner of the Triwizard Tournament.As the tiny brunette girl from Beauxbatons walked into the clearing of the arena she was slightly dazed and confused by the lack of surroundings. I think most of the crowd was confused. She walked towards the center and stood still basking in the calm before the storm. The nervous tension radiating from her stance and tight jaw magnified from the screens above the stands.A loud rumbling came from far away and projected across the entire stadium as a hush fell across the crowds-“Champion! Today you will need all of the courage awarded you. This fight will be your own. What is more terrifying than facing your greatest fears?”Hermione felt a serge of magic course through her as a shimmering barrier encased the lower half of the stadium protecting those in the stands as the arena. As quick at the buzzing of the protection wards were put in place the arena was plunged into darkness around the young Beauxbatons witch. There was no site of her, people were looking around to their friends and family worried looks on their faces as they wondered what might be happening.A breath held in Hermiones throat- although she was Hogwarts competition Hermione and her friends had become used to having Lou and her classmates around during their time in Paris. If it wasn’t enough having Draco go through this she also would have to watch her new friend too. Her stomach sank when the light returned to the bottom half and what was revealed in it’s wake.Giant cascading boulders and rubble, large cavernous edges that dropped into darkness- the ground beneath Lou had altered so incredibly that she was teetering on the edge of a crumbling terrain ready to plunge if she didn’t move. That wasn’t what made Hermiones heart sink-An almighty snarling roar shot through the clearing startling the chamption and crowd. If Hermione had to guess right; Lou was most terrified of the first challenge in the last Triwizard Tournament- complete with Dragon and all. Elouise made no attempts to move from her position, almost like she was stuck with fear. The masses called and cheered for the young girl but Hermione could see the sheer terror in her eyes, hidden behind her brave face she was purely petrified. Hermione knew that look, she had the very same for most of the last years.The scaly red dragon moved stealthily on its feet as it made its way through the rough crevices of rock. It’s scales burnt and marred all over from a terrible life of mistreatment, it was angry and resentful and out for blood. The creature battering rock faces with its powerful wings and claws as it moved further into the arena and closer to the champion.Elouise heard the distinguishing call of her most feared foe and jolted to life- running as fast as she could with sure footing to make distance. The uneven ground seeming to be an issue with the speed that she was attempting. Her hostile and angry counterpart was gaining on her and she knew that she would not be able to outrun it. All she had to do was find higher ground to get the advantage.She began her climb, although not the fastest route it was the smartest. Hearing the dragon closing in on her location as it tried to listen for her and pinpoint it’s preys location. Lou tried to steady her breathing, chest heaving and Hermione could see her close her eyes if only for a second to settle her mind.Hermione felt movement beside her as she saw Harry sit down on the bench, he could see the tension in her eyes and the grasping of her hands to her skirt. Leaning over, he took one of her hands in his and squeezed tightly as she sat on the edge of her seat. Their rowel long forgotten in this moment. He always seemed to be able to calm her in any situation.Thankful for the new found support she knew she needed Hermione watched on as Lou found her way to the highest point of rock formations and was able to look down on the imminent danger continuing towards her. The timing would need to be perfect Hermione thought to herself, she would only have a very small window to be able to incapacitate the beast before it figured her location and flew up to meet her.The murderous charcoal colored eyes of the dragon swiveled around the lower levels of the arena as it tried to anticipate where its kill would be- continuously adapting and listening to the surroundings for any signs. Lou would have only been one hundred meters above the creature and biding her time before she had to prove her heroics. Hermione saw her brain ticking over, formulating a plan for execution-Suddenly the dragon began to climb. Must have had the same ideas as Lou by taking the high ground. It’s clawed talons stabbing into the rock face and barely phasing the wild creature as it ascended the very formation Lou was standing.She needed to act now- Hermione stood to her feet as she watched in horror, worried for her friends life as the Dragon neared the top of the structure. It’s notoriously tough hide was the one thing stopping the easy kill. There were very few ways to take down a dragon and Hermione hoped to Gods that Elouise had studied them all in the off chance this might come up.
  It was now or never…
The witch picked up a large rock in her hand and threw it towards the opposite edge of the rock formation- the split second of distraction and confusion caused the Dragon to turn it’s head and face the other direction. Lou launched herself from the top of the structure and landed square behind the head of the beast grasping tightly as the beast began to thrash attempting to throw her off.A second was all Lou needed- she thrust her wand forcefully into the dragons eye; with a wailing shriek from the dragon Lou could be heard over the screatch yelling “CONFRINGO” at the top of her lungs. The loud explosion rocked the stands of the stadium as the head of the dragon blew to shreds, small pieces of flesh cascading down into the abyss and covering the rock face crimson with death. As the beast began its freefall into darkness Lou grabbed at the closest ledge and held on tightly to save herself from falling. She clambered up again slowly, completely spent by her magic and the adrenalin seeping through her veins as she levelled herself out onto the closest flat rock.Covered almost head to foot in dragons blood the young girl lay basking in her victory, panting heavily but a brilliant smile plastered across her face as the stands erupted into a sea of cheers for the Champion from Beauxbatons.The magical shield was lifted and a Mediwitch apparated into the arena to tend to Lou as Hermione was once again able to breathe. Hermione turned towards Harry sitting next to her and she saw the look of complete awe on his face as he registered the events that just occurred in front of him.“What a witch” he whispered almost to himself.Hermione giggled quietly and leant over to her best friend- “you know, I could introduce you?”Harry blushed a fierce red as he shook himself back to sense. He ran his hand through his tousled dark hair and smiled at Hermione. With his becoming an Auror there would be no reason that a relationship in Paris wouldn’t work after all.The arena was cleared away and the rock formations returned to the flat sand it once was to make way for the next challenger.Hermiones stomach was sinking as she sat there waiting. How would she be able to sit through this, Dracos greatest fear. He didn’t even know it was coming.She was brought back to life by the announcement starting over again- “Champion!” She looked down to find the Durmstrang boy standing in the center of the stadium. ----------------- Draco was left alone to his thoughts in the tiny room of menial awards- Emil had left through the door without a second glance at him which he was more than happy with.His mind wandering back to the conversation with his parents only two hours earlier. Sitting and listening to his father talk about Hermione in such a way only spurred him on to show her that she was so much more than what his father had said. Draco had no second thoughts in his words or the actions he would take if they refused his intentions of being with his witch.
  Even if it meant leaving behind his family name and history to be with her, he would. 
A genuine smile swept across his face as the thought came to his mind.
  He was going to marry this witch, one day… hopefully soon.
For now that was enough to keep him going. Holding onto that he rose from his chair and stood before the wall that sectioned him off from the final task he needed to perform before he could be with Hermione and the beginning of the rest of his life.Slowly as if on queue the door materialized and Dracos name was called- he wandered blindly into the darkness as the room behind him closed off and he continued his steady steps towards his future. -- An old wooden door with metal crisscross stood in front of Draco as he slowed at the end of the tunnel, this was the first object that he had seen in his walk from the room and it was dully lit by a sconce in the corner. I guess this is it.He approached with cautious hands and brought the delicate gold key from the second challenge from his pocket. It slid into the keyhole and with a soft ‘click’ unlocked the castle door. Pushing heavily on the decrepit wood he sunk into a bright white light that bathed the entire hallway rendering him blind as he ventured on. As his eye site slowly adjusted he found himself in a sand covered arena surrounded by stadium seating where the crowds were sitting.Draco could hear the faint chanting of his name over the cheering and overall merriment of the tournament. His spirits soared at the declaration of acceptance from the hordes of people present at this moment. All he could do was stand and wait for what he knew was coming. It didn’t stop him searching the crowds for his witch (without success).Just as he eased into the surroundings a loud male voice echoed into the arena almost deafening him in the process.    “Champion! Today you will need all of the courage awarded you. This fight will be your own. What is more terrifying than facing your greatest fears?” Dracos heart dropped to his stomach as he thought through what could possibly show up in this challenge, his life had been filled so far with more fear and death than he cared to admit. More than the average person would ever come across in their lifetime-The bright lights and sun faded to black in a moment, all there was now was complete deafening silence plaguing his senses. Darkness wasn’t his greatest fear, he knew that the worst was yet to come. There was a shift in the air around him, an eerie vibe of dark magic hanging like a stench in the air. Draco had smelt this before, it was the haze of death lingering and clinging to every sense. The darkness shifted and his heart stopped when the courtyard of Hogwarts materialized around him.Draco gasped for air, his lungs constricted and burning as he was forced back into the grounds of Hogwarts during the battle. He collapsed in a heap as he tried to right his body, willing it to work again so that he could get the fuck out of there. As he grasped and shifted up a pillar to the side of the courtyard he was again jolted back in his memory when a familiar seething voice ran shivers down his spine-“Harry Potter is dead-”Voldemort appeared in the space ahead of Draco, he moved swiftly behind the pillar to shield himself from view- drawing his wand with white knuckles as his breath came out in rasps. He couldn't defeat Voldemort, he wasn't strong enough- Draco would surely die.“Your war has been lost- there is no use fighting anymore” the cold drawl skimmed the cobblestone floor projecting towards a group of students and teachers that had materialized into view.Draco inched forward so that he would be able to see if anyone else had formed, sure enough the army of death eaters stood proud and prominent behind their master, his parents front and center. Dracos father at Voldemorts right, blood streaked across his face and through his white hair- his mother clutching his hand. Draco could see the pain and terror in her eyes as she took in the scene before her. She did not have her wand drawn, she wouldn't raise her wand to a group of children- let alone for the cause of someone so dark. Chest heaving he tried to still his movements so that he was not discovered before he could work out what it was he needed to do. Sweat dripping from his forehead and hands shaking his looked back towards the students and found the members of The Order standing tall, making their statement known.He heard her voice before he had spotted her- “We will never stop fighting! We will never give up!” Hermione proudly took her place at the head of the formation, leading them into battle and likely to their death. Dracos heart stopped beating, the silence in the air was deathly. The blood began to rage through his veins, the thrumming in his ears of his heart pounding against his ribs as he watched Hermione raise her wand and point it towards the evil before her.There was no question in Dracos mind- he needed to save her!He didn’t care about any fucking tournament, this was real- he needed to fight for her, fight with her. He had been a coward for too long, only thinking of himself and self preservation of his family. This was about so much more now. He needed to step from the darkness into the light. As the shouts and war cries echoed around the courtyard the sneers from the Death Eaters wailed back.“It seems that I must, not only defeat Harry Potter but also his little Mudblood before the reality sinks in”. Voldemort called to his followers as they laughed in jeer. 
  No! Hermione. 
The erratic thumping of his heart seized as he knew what was coming- he had seen it so many times before, but this time it meant everything to him. This was his greatest fear- losing Hermione.In a split second and without thought he rounded the pillar as a blinding light erupted from the end of Voldemorts wand- a haze and flash of green streaking through the air as time slowed to a crawl in front of Dracos eyes.
  Dying for her, it would be his greatest achievement in life. 
He apparated at the last moment throwing himself in front of Hermione as the shock jolted through his back and into his heart, he gazed into her golden brown eyes as he collapsed- Light became dark. Life became death. 
  
    Chapter Text
    The silence was deafening- Hermiones heart jolted as her throat constricted in rasped pain from the screaming that ripped from her lungs. Hers was the only sound that was heard from the entire stadium as Draco fell to the ground in the center of the courtyard.
His body crumpled in front of her form that had appeared during the challenge- dull and motionless. Hermione felt the tears streaming down her cheeks as she realized the finality of what had just happened- Draco was dead.
The protection wards fell as the courtyard and its inhabitants disappeared into oblivion, the sandy floor was cleared of all bar the still figure of her love laying lifeless in a heap.
Hermione standing in her seat saw the flurry of panic in the Mediwitch as she apparated into the arena, not caring what happened to her now Hermione took her wand in hand and spun on the spot apparating in next to the witch and bolted towards the only thing that matter to her in life.
She knelt next to his still warm form, her vision blurred and her hands shook as she ran one softly over his pale cheek. The air around them thick with grief and darkness- a battle once fought replayed for the world to see. Hermiones breath a ragged mess, she had lost the only man she truly loved, the only person who she could be her honest self with. A wave of coldness draining through her body as she crumbled.
“No… Draco, please don’t leave me-” she cried, tears falling from her eyes and onto his face as she leant down to press a firm kiss against his soft lips- there was no reaction, no gentle smile against her lips, no air rushing from his mouth in a surprised gasp, no life.
“We only just found one another”, ghosting across his face her lips traced his forehead, his temple, his eyes, before another longing kiss to his mouth- “this can’t be the end”.
The silence was heart wrenching, a strangled sob tore from her as her heart broke in two, she had finally found something for her- something to live for. A love that was hers and his. And now it was gone…
The unchanging stillness from every person in the stadium made her cries echo into the air- Hermione rested her forehead against his as the gravity washed over ever person present. Another life lost to the TriWizard Tournament. Another life lost to the war.
Clutching at his shirt she cried what felt like endless tears-
 
 
There was a gentle touch to Hermiones cheek as she fought against the person trying to move her away from Draco. The hand moved across her face and she batted it away. The hand returned and grazed lightly over her cheek and down to her lips. A light caress over her lower lip- like a lover would. Hermione stilled.. swiftly blinking the tears away, there was only one person who would caress her in such a way. Her head lifted as she was met with two platinum eyes looking up to her face. An unwavering smile ran across Dracos lips as Hermione stared in disbelief at the miracle in front of her.
“How.. What.. How are you alive?” She whispered in disbelief as he grabbed her face pulling her towards him.
Draco looked into her eyes as he searched her features- “I don’t know-” he paused for a moment as he traced the contours of her face and ran his fingers through her hair, tucking a stray curl behind her ear. “All I know is that I need you Hermione, you are all I need in this life to be happy”. Draco planted a searing kiss against her mouth as the once silent crowd exploded with cheers of elation.
She couldn’t believe what he had done for her- Draco had sacrificed himself for her to live. Denying everything that he had grown up knowing, that her life wasn’t worthy of his- in front of his parents and everyone else that he knew, Draco had chosen her over everything else.
Hermione melted into his kiss as they embraced one another, her tears of joy ran down their cheeks as her heart was once again whole. The stadium completely lost to the pair as the only thing that mattered was just them.
 
 
--
 
The tournament concluded as the Headmaster of Beauxbatons wandering onto the sand- he waved his wand and a large podium appeared in front of the Champions and the Heads of each school. Hermione stood beside Draco not wanting to leave his side- and no one expected her to.
 The tall spindly wizard with dark eyes and short grey hair walked onto the podium before conducting a projection spell- his voice booming through the stadium.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, students and teachers- today we were lucky enough to bear witness to great acts of bravery and courage in the face of overwhelming fear. The fight in each champion shone through as they undertook their challenge with great resilience and determination”. The headmaster looked around towards Draco.
“As I’m sure you are all now aware, the tournament will be conducted differently from here on- there are forces in place to ensure the safety of life so that we shall never have to mourn the loss of another Champion”.
Hermione scoffed next to Draco as she moved in closer, clenching forcefully at his hand- “they could have told us that from the start”. Her voice exhausted and irritated but she continued to cling to him like he was going to float away if she let go.
The Headmaster continued- “That being said- there must be a Triwizard Champion, and although the show of bravery throughout this entire tournament has been immense there can only be one winner”.
The stands were silent, waiting on bated breath for the announcement they had all waited for-
 
“It is my very great pleasure to announce the winner of this Triwizard Tournament is… Elouise Moreau”.
 
There were great cries of excitement and applause from the hordes of onlookers as Elouise took her rightful position on the stage in front of everyone. Face beaming and full of pride as her Headmaster presented her with the shining silver and lightning blue cup. Draco couldn’t help the swell of pride as he smiled at the young Beauxbatons Champion and his now friend. She definitely deserved the win from what Hermione had told him of her challenge.
He stood weighted against Hermione as his body ached from the realistic jolts of being cursed, there was only so much the Mediwitch could do to ease his pains. But hey, at least he hadn’t been killed. He clutched tighter to Hermiones hand.
Elouise stood with cup in hand, raising it above her head in triumph- she paused for a moment lowering the cup and leant to her Headmaster to speak in his ear briefly. He nodded his head and she turned back towards the front of the stage. The Beauxbatons headmaster raised his wand and cast the projection spell to Elouises’ throat- she spoke as the crowds went silent once more.
“I thank each one of you; for your support and love throughout this tournament. I am so grateful for the new friends that I have made during their time here at the Academy”. She turned towards Draco and Hermione, staring at them with a grin. “But mostly I want to say, I think that this Tournament is worthy of two Champions this year”. Her eyes moved to Draco.
Dracos cheeks flooded with warmth- Eloiuse motioned for him to join her on the podium. Hermione stood back slightly, letting go of his hand she pushed at the small of his back to propel him forward.
“Not only did you try to defend me in the first challenge, you also today have shown to those here and everyone else your worth as a man- the lengths that you would go to protecting those that you love the most. You may not have won the final challenge but I believe you deserve to win over all. It would be my honor to share the title of Triwizard Champion with you Draco Malfoy”.
Draco could not believe what he was hearing. His feet were carrying him subconsciously towards the stage, his eyes wandered to the people around him for confirmation that this was actually happening. Indeed it was.
He approached Elouise at the center and she offered a side of the cup for him to hold. The silver framework cool under his touch as Elouise again raised the cup into the air with Dracos arm following- his ears drowned out by the noises around him as warmth radiated through his body. He had done it… won the Triwizard Tournament with Elouise.
There was absolute elation filtering down from the stands as he took in the cheering- ‘Malfoy’ they chanted- people waved Hogwarts colours, held up signs they had made to encourage him and for once… for once in his life, he felt like the hero… like he could be proud of the person that he was and the things that he had accomplished.
He turned his head towards the only person he truly cared about and he watched as the beauty before him; with her golden brown eyes and cascading brunette curls swept away a tear that was falling down her cheek- a look of pure love and pride across her face as she gazed at him.
 

  Pure love. Nothing else mattered.

    “Draco, if you don’t tell me where we are going how am I meant to dress accordingly?” Hermione crossed the wide spanning penthouse that overlooked views of Paris but most importantly- the twinkling lights of the Eifel Tower.“If I tell you where we are going then it wouldn’t be a surprise…” Draco teased his witch as she stalked away to the bathroom with a pout to her face. “Here, let me pick something for you”.He wandered to the armoire in the corner and opened the doors to a flurry of colours and fabrics. “Bloody hell Hermione… How much shopping did you and mother do yesterday?” Draco fingered his way through the first few dresses, not quite finding what he was looking for.Hermione poked her head from the bathroom grinning like a Cheshire cat. Her sweet tanned skin on full display as Draco eyed her through his peripherals. “She seems to rather like spending time with me when she is able to spend her galleons. Besides, who am I to tell Narcissa Malfoy no?”Draco snorted. “I’m fairly sure you have told her no on quite a number of occasions now. Either way, this…” he held up a beaded green dress that he knew his mother had picked out under his advisement- “is perfect”.She crossed the room once again to look over his selection and smirked, “anyone would think you were bias to it for it’s Slytherine colours”. Hermione went to grab for the garment but Draco snatched his hand away quickly.“Then again Granger… I do rather like what you are wearing now...” he clicked his tongue.. “Well it’s settled- you will have to go out in just your knickers and that delectable corset”. He flashed her a seductive grin as he ran his eyes up and down her body.“Draco Malfoy! I will not go parading around Paris in my underwear thank you. Especially if you have planned to meet up with Harry and Lou”. Hermione blushed at the idea as Draco laughed. Stalking over to his beautiful girlfriend he threw the dress onto the bed and grabbed hold of her waist.“Harry and Lou are in London at the moment looking for apartments- tonight it’s just you and me…” He lifted her up as she gave a little squeal and wrapped her legs around his hips. Draco supported her weight as he ran a gentle caressing hand up her spine and through her rough curls- pulling her towards him their lips met in a desperate kiss.Hermione tangled her hands in his hair as they explored each other, her movements wandering down to his chest as he shuddered at her fingertips. Walking them slowly towards the luxurious four poster Draco lowered her softly to the silk covers. 
  One year with this witch by his side, he had never been happier. 
 He climbed slowly over her as he moved his attention down her cheek and neck, his lips ghostly softly against her skin leaving a shiver in their wake. His fingers dancing gracefully along her ribs covered by the white satin corset, playing with the tiny thin string that held the fabric together.Draco broke away from her neck and whispered across her skin- “now, as much as I adore your choice in knickers- these just won’t do”. He smirked into her collarbone and continued to kiss between each sentence and pause. “We will have to find something that will suit this dress-” He slid his tongue down the front of her chest, towards the dip between her breasts as he pulled gently on the corset string.The fabric gave way under its bindings and parted to uncover Hermiones breasts. “I vote… no knickers at all”. Draco said as he worked lower- “What say you?” he said.Hermione went to answer but was abruptly cut off as Draco took one of her nipples into his mouth, sucking and licking at the tight peak as her body arched into him and moaned her answer in nonsense.Draco threaded his fingers through the lace of her underwear and swiftly removed them, throwing them into a pile of clothing on the floor. “I’m sorry love, what was that?” he watched her writhing, begging to be touched as his hands wandered over her body. Knowing every square inch of her by memory now.“I…” she began again. “Oh Gods! Draco”.Draco slid his long delicate fingers through her slick folds, glistening with want- “I think it’s settled then- no knickers under this dress”. He parted her legs further and slid two fingers inside her core. She moaned into the canopy of the bed as he worked her slowly, languorously- starting off with gentle thrusts as he curled his fingers inside to press.“Fuck”, she whimpered as he gained pace. Draco moved up the bed and began kissing her feverishly while his movements quickened. He could feel her tightening- pressing down and clenching his fingers. The quite sound of her panting and gasping as she drew her closer. He withdrew his fingers causing an anguished cry to come tumbling from her mouth as he quickly divested himself of the little clothing he had on.Hermione grabbed at his shoulders pulling him back onto her and grabbed at the nape of his neck- her lips pressed to his ear, “I will never wear underwear again if you promise to fuck me right now”.Draco groaned into her shoulder, his cool, calm and collected was quickly diminishing as he grabbed her thigh and pressed it up to his hip. Her hair had begun to stick to her forehead in traitorous curls and the makeup she had spend almost forty minutes on was quickly losing its shine. However he looked at her in this moment and could not see anything but perfection.“Never again?” He grinned with the idea of Hermione never wearing underwear again- “I think I’m in love”. He chuckled quickly before she glared at him.. Right.. the fucking part.Draco pressed his cock through slick heat as he sunk in, earning a gasp as Hermione felt the fullness that he provided. Her walls tightening as he buckled slightly at her grasp- fuck she was incredible. Every single bloody part of her. He never wanted to be apart from this witch ever again. His cock slid out and then in to the hilt as he felt the deep angle pressing against her inner walls, unlike before he moved with purpose. Heated and needy as he plunged into her depths- her breathing became erratic, her fingernails digging into his shoulders as he fucked her harder.“Yes, fuck Draco- harder!” His movements became frantic as he felt her walls clenching around him. “Just like that! Yes!” she cried.He grabbed hold of a tight nipple and pinched- she let out a guttural moan as she drew nearer. “Fuck, Hermione- I’m close” Draco said as he ran his finger down her body to circle her clit. She gasped as he played with the tight bundle eliciting every sound and movement he needed to spur him on harder.She came crashing over the edge and into bliss- her thighs quaking as she cried out his name and he followed her over in a wave of heat and pure ecstasy. They laid in each others arms, a panting sweaty mess- just revelling in the closeness and love they had together. Draco gained his breath and prompted movement. “We need to get going soon”.Hermione remained still, wondering if they could just stay in the hotel all night. Pulling her slowly from the bed he helped her into the beautifully delicate beaded gown- without knickers.Draco walked them down to the lobby of the hotel and out to the street and apparition point. Keeping quiet about his plans for the night. -- Hermione wasn’t sure where they were going or what they were doing but she was still almost completely legless after that shag. She clung to Draco as he led her through the streets of Paris to the apparition point.So much had changed in the year they had been together, it almost felt like they were different people- but not different together.They had finished their year at Hogwarts, Draco had found a new sense of purpose as he was seen differently in the wizarding world now. Once the Death Eater, feared and hated- now he was somewhat a treasure. The world had bared witness to the person he had become from the media that attended the Triwizard Tournament, he had turned that into opportunities to create charitable events for the rebuilding and maintaining of new ideologies surrounding equality for all magical beings. Draco had made a new name for himself and for his family in the process- one of honor and courage in the face of fear.
  To say that Hermione was proud would be the understatement of the century. 
His parents had slowly but surely come on board with his views and supported his decisions considering how much he had helped the Malfoy name. In turn they had turned a corner, no longer opposed to Hermione and her blood status like they had been. It had taken a long time but they were finally on some form of even ground. Lucius and Narcissa had witnessed the final challenge and what lengths each of them would go for the other, it was hard not to realize the bond they shared and love they felt. Narcissa could not deny her son the happiness she knew he deserved after all he had been through- Lucius would take a while longer.Hermione had begun her career with the Ministry as an advisor to the Deputy Minister. Not even three weeks ago she had been given word that when the Deputy was to retire in a year she would be tapped on the shoulder. Her fears that life would go back to the way it was when they returned to Hogwarts were unwarranted- Draco and Hermione had ended the year by moving in together in a quaint apartment in London and decided on an anniversary present of travelling to Paris.Here they were-Draco slid his hand into hers as they rounded the last corner. “Ready?” he said as he looked into her eyes. The steely grey looked peaceful tonight- content.“Absolutely” she smiled.They apparated side by side and Draco landed them a small distance away from a very familiar bridge. At night it didn’t sparkle like it had the first time Hermione saw it. She turned towards him with a bright smile as they walked up further. “A little overdressed aren’t we?” she questioned but secretly chuckled at the idea of them in their fineries walking across a bridge at night.Draco smirked as he once again helped her up the edge as they began crossing the bridge. There were no tourists at this time of night. Just her and him. Walking over to the array of locks Hermione searched for hers and Dracos. He leant against the edging while she knelt in her exploration. “Did you find it?” he said quietly. She shook her head.“You know I love you Granger”. He pushed off from his lean to stand next to her. She shifted to look up at him. His face serious and heavy. He was nervous. Her heart stuttered for a moment.“Try over here”. He pointed to a smaller section of locks and she moved slowly looking over each one with precision. She spotted the small silver and green lock and smiled widely that she had found it. With a little help from him of course.Hermione stood and was greeted by another familiar site. The glorious orange Peony, her favourite colour. Reaching down she traced the charms on her bracelet as Draco held out the flower for her to take.“Do you remember when I said that one day I would tell you what I had spoken in French when I gave you the first flower?” Hermione nodded. Apparently she had forgotten how to speak. “C'était la fleur que mon père a donnée à ma mère le jour où il lui a demandé” he said again- “It translates to- This is the flower that my father gave my mother the day he asked her to be his.”He ran his hand through the back of his hair as he let the sentence sink in- “Hermione, even back then I knew-” He moved slowly, like a whisper- down to his knee on the grated bridge and he took Hermiones hand in his- like they had watched the other couples do all that time ago.She gasped as he pulled the small wooden box from his pocket and opened it slowly. “You make me a better person Hermione, you always have- Marry me?” A tiny sob escaped her lips as she tried to hold in her tears, a smile worked across her face as she nodded her head desperately. “Yes Draco.” she whispered to him. His face crested, complete happiness brimming as he got to his feet and slid the perfect green sapphire ring onto her finger.Draco picked her up and spun her as she kissed him whole heartedly. They stayed there, in the moonlight of a warm Paris night, making plans for their future- together.
