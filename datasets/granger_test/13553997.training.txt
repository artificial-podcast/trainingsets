“Fucking hell!” I hissed out, the curls of my fingers taught against the soft plane of my palm as my nails dug into the flesh there in a biting manner.  My eyes wandered around aimlessly, breath hitching in time with the obnoxious thrumming of my heart against my straining rib cage. Panic, high and unwelcoming, bubbled up the clenching of my throat to elicit a sort of shuddering wheeze from my parted lips as nerves settles into the rush of my blood stream.   A growl, low and thunderous, sounded throughout the unnerving quiet of the forest surrounding me. The tone was harsh, a rumble that vibrated within the confines of my chest spread out in an agonizingly slow descent to my gut to skate over the inner expanse of my thighs. My body jerked from its spot behind a large oak tree, eyes widening significantly when a gasp, unbridled and shocked, emitted from my mouth. There was a heat, an undeniable warmth that scorned over my groin and made a sudden dizzying dip in my stomach. My cock twitched beneath the onslaught of my trousers and I panicked even more at my reaction to that growl just now.   What the bloody hell is wrong with me?!   I knew I shouldn’t have gone back to Hogwarts, but of course, my pride got the best of me and I wanted to show everyone in the wizarding world that even though the Malfoy’s have fallen from their high ground of riches and status, we were still capable, still strong witted and intelligent. With father in prison for the rest of his shame ridden life and my mother wallowing away in the Malfoy Mansion in the absence of my father, I had to get up and do something for the family. I had to try and take back our dignity and show the wizarding world that the Malfoy’s weren’t weak enough to hide away from everyone. No. My pride as a Malfoy wouldn’t allow me to do such a thing. But now, I wished that I would have stayed home and self taught myself the rest of the lessons that I am supposed to be taught while going to Hogwarts.   I just wanted to get out of the school for a while. To distance myself from the sneers that followed my every move, from the hushed, dark laced whispers that I could feel skate down the length of my back and up as my ears picked up the taunt and disdain the students talked of whenever I was around.   Now I was going to die.   And from a werewolf that I happened to stumble upon as it was eating some other animal’s corpse near the clearing of a lake behind Hogwarts.   I glanced at my reflection staring back at me from the milky froth of the lake I had come across, my features pinched in worry and fear. My hair was a mess of silvery light blond strands, a color similar to that of a blank canvas, blindingly white. Pansy told me my hair was the color of the shimmering substance that catered on a falling snowflake, fascinatingly pale. I disagreed with that gods awful depiction of my hair. Right now, the stands of my hair was chaotic and making me look like Medusa on her worst hair day. I noticed the way my body trembled at the light, cooling breeze that swept around my person. It didn’t help that I had come out for a walk in only my black pressed trousers and long sleeved white shirt, all of which were loose over my thin and petite frame. The pants barely hung onto the sharp jut of my hipbones.   I cringed at the sight of which I presented of myself.   I was going to die tonight and I was going to look horrible doing so. At the very least, I wanted to die looking my best.   Rolling my bottom lip into my mouth and letting my teeth graze the skin there in an insistent jabbing habit of mine, I took in my haphazard state. My eyes were so large and stricken with unadulterated terror. The pale grey of my eyes shone with a moonstone film, a watery substance in the silver wisps making my gaze turn into a crystalline gunmetal hue. Mother always talked about how my eyes resembled that of a blind person, the grey faded out, bleached of its color and drained.   I hated them. Even more so when they were large with anxiety because they made me look weaker than I already was. My eyes made me look like a scared kitten instead of the cold demeanor my father carried around with him with his stormy grey gaze. Even though I hated him, I admired how he didn’t emit weakness like I did.   With the situation I found myself in at the moment, my skin was more paler than usual. My skin was a sharp contrast with the bags beneath my eyes from countless, restless nights I’ve endured since the death of Voldemort. I still had nightmares, still shook and screamed in my sleep until my voice grew hoarse and I ended up in Pomfrey's office for healing meds for the soreness of my throat and sleeping aid potions.   I didn’t take the potions. They made me feel nauseous.   The snap of a stick echoed throughout the forest, causing my back to run rigid straight and my arms to fold over the span of my stomach in an unconscious gesture to protect myself. How this action was supposed to keep me safe? I hadn’t a clue.   Squeezing my eyes shut and chastising myself for letting Professor Snape take my wand in accordance to my punishment for helping the dark lord against my will, I tried to even my breathing out, trying not to picture the huge wolf with dark brown, almost obsidian chipped fur as it’s sleek and muscled shoulders shifted in its heavy weight to prowl closer to my prone figure.   When I had seen it at the clearing a moment back, I had froze up. The creature was big, its height large and foreboding as it leaned its blackened snout into the clear waters and flicked its tongue out to lap at the liquid. My breath stuttered at remembering the pure power and strength the werewolf shown, even in its relaxed state. But then it had snapped its head my direction to stare me down with amber flecked eyes and watched me for more than a few unnerving minutes. It's eyes were focused and calculating, as if assessing every part of my body and what it held beneath. And I had felt stripped bare, something that I never felt before to the point where I panicked and ran. A dumb decision that was.   After maybe around twenty minutes of wandering about in the dark shadows of the woods, I decided to round back as silently and quickly as I could in an effort to lose the werewolf only to hear its steps surrounding me once again and make me hide behind a tree near the clearing, back where I started.   The wolf, embarrassingly so, reminded me of someone. Someone who attended Hogwarts and was completely different from what I remembered him to be.   I bit down on my lip harder at the image of Neville Longbottom and his towering, lean and muscled physique with golden hued eyes. My cock throbbed then at the mere thought of the guy. My cheeks, despite the cold, felt hot all of the sudden, the warmth spreading up my neck.   Fuck. Shit! Now is not the time!   Shaking my head, I snapped my eyes open, only to yelp out when a pair of those jasper, illuminate eyes were only a breadth away from my own.   I reared back as if someone had slapped me across the face and had the back of my head jar against the tree stump. I released a cry, high pitched and tearing away from my moist mouth, body shivering as the werewolf snuffed hot air over my forehead to brush away the stray strands there and cause a riotous tremor to rock my frame.   “Pl-please. You don’t want t-to eat me, I … I taste horrible. All r-rotten and t-too sweet.” What in the bloody fuck am I saying? Malfoy’s never stutter and here I was now, a blubbering mess.   The werewolf closed in on me, abrupt and in such a blurring movement that I had gone incredibly still when I found myself pressed against the tree trunk and wanting it to swallow me whole when the creature leaned its massive head down and brushed dark lips and elongated, claw like teeth, over the spot where my neck met my shoulder.   My chest heaved up and down, the air stifled as I practically started to hyperventilate.     The surprisingly soft and smooth fur of the wolf caressed over my neck when I felt it shift the slightest bit as my eyes stayed hooked on its own, thinking if I looked away from those eyes for even a moment, the wolf would snap at me.   I felt it sniff below the hollow of my ear and I couldn’t suppress the whimper that clogged in my chest and let it escape.   The creature then went still.   I held my breath, all oxygen seeming to halt in its place in my lungs and leave me stranded of air.   Looking up at the werewolf from beneath my lashes, I nervously flicked my tongue across my lips and saw its heated gaze follow the movement.   Then everything happened at once. Too fast for me to comprehend.   I had yelled out, stricken and startled, when the werewolf moved its head down and released a deep growl that etched itself into my very being. Its nose, wet and hot, pressed into my groin, causing my whole body to seize and arch at the heavy contact on my throbbing cock.   “Wh-What are you doing?” I gasped out, mouth parting even more when the creature looked up at me with those glowing amber orbs of his and nuzzled further down over my stiffening dick and underneath my balls.   My legs parted, trembling and shock ridden, as I splayed them out, my body seeming to have a conscience of its own.   The werewolf rumbled then.   My knees weakened, feeling all strength leave my body as they gave out without any further notice.   The creature blew out a hot breath against my lower half as I slouched forward and flailed my arms about to grasp onto its muscled, fur covered back. I squeaked when my knees bent around the head of the werewolf for leverage of my fall and let out a heavy whine when the wolf all but shoved my ass back into its snout and pressed into the crack of my buttocks.   My shaking fingers, limp and confused with a fire scorching through my person, grasped at the fur on the werewolf’s back when it rubbed its nose up and down the line of my ass, nuzzling in further as if threatening to break through my trousers to nestle between my cheeks.   “P-please stop. What do you w-want from me?” I breathed out against the fur, cheek pressed over its shoulder as I gulped in lungfuls of air. As if it gave no regards to my words, its nose nudged against the curve of my ass almost reverently before my breath stuck in my lungs as my world tipped on its axis and another yelp sounded from my lying from across the earthy ground.   I stared up at the creature that crouched above me on all fours, my heart hammering wildly and my eyes widening even more when it lifted its paw and retracted a viscously curved claw to swipe it down the pant leg of my trousers on my right inner thigh and tore it from my body.   A choke sounded in my chest as the night air fogged over my bare thighs and legs as the wolf tore away at my clothes, leaving me in only my silky green fitted briefs.   In an attempt to keep any sense of decency, especially under the narrowed eyed gaze of the werewolf’s that seemed as if it held more knowledge than it should for such a creature, I flailed my arms up and attempted to cover my bottom half. I crossed my legs over one another to keep the wolf's eyes covered from my cock, which was embarrassingly twitching.   Something is fucking wrong with me!?   The werewolf tilted its head, soft raven black feather like tufts rustling about in the evening breeze while those illuminate amber flecked eyes seared into my very bones.   I shivered beneath it's gaze, feeling overexposed and undeniably bare.   “Don't.” I whispered, so softly to my own ears that with any other human being around me, they wouldn't have heard, but the creatures hearing sure picked up on it with the way it's ears twitched at my breathless tone.   Then it shifted, haunches sticking out as it moved even closer to my prone figure.   I clenched my thighs together with a bruising force then.   But fuck, those eyes had my neck heating up and the warmth spreading out over my cheeks like a maiden whore.   A whine, high pitched and heat stroked, passed my quivering lips when the werewolf hovered over my twitching dick, nudged my quaking hands away from its coverage of my groin, and ran the length of its tongue right over my hole, past my balls, and to the tip of the head of my cock.   A scream, of fear conflicting pleasure, ripped out of my throat and shattered the silence of the night. The tongue sopping wet and pressing teasingly over the thin fabric of my boxers.   My arms snapped up on their own accord, hands gripping fists full of the werewolf silken fur on its head to harshly tug at it in a fevered frenzy.   Oh god.   Ah fuck.   My body shook, like thunder rolling down my spine as it arched like a strung up bow, the fuss of my hair brushing across the dirt stained floor as I felt high.   The creature growled, this time, with a sinister countenance, all dark and threatening, so fucking deep that it rattled my bones.   And then it stopped.   My eyes flung wide open, taking in the sudden lack of any presence around me.   I lay there, panting and hard as hell while the werewolf seemed to have disappeared all together. A frozen sensation fell over me, causing my back to thud against the ground once again and my head to fall sideways as I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to hell that no one saw me out here before I got the courage to stand the fuck up again and walk on weakened knees back to the Slytherin dorm rooms.     I was dead tired.   There wasn't a single cell in my body that didn't scream out in tired shame. I felt like a diseased cow.   Pansy was talking a mile a minute, a continuous motorboat as her voice filtered in through my hazy thoughts every now and then, eliciting my head to bob in agreement and a muttered accordance to her words.   I had my fork picking at the salad I chose for lunch this dreadful day.   I wasn't that hungry.   Pansy then proceeded to slap a stinging palm across my right shoulder.   “What is it, you bumbling bitch?” I seethed through gritted teeth and eyes sharp as I twisted my head around and up so I could level my gaze on the brunette sitting beside me. Her light brown, hazel gaze leveled with mine as she arched an artfully curved brow and pursed her cherry stained glossed lips in m direction.   Pansy Parkinson was my best friend because she knew how to handle my bitchiness when I couldn't. She was also a drop dead gorgeous woman with her modeler figure. Her posh attitude fitted well with her sassy personality.   “You need to get your pretty little head out of that ass of yours, darling.” Pansy drawled in a mocking tone.   I rolled my eyes. “It's not my fault that you're utterly boring to converse with these days, sweetheart. Perhaps try to come up with better material when you speak with me.” I rested my elbow a top of the dining table, letting the curve of my cheek rest over my curled knuckles as I gave Pansy a wry uptick of a smirk.   Pansy scoffed next to me and reached over to pluck lettuce off of my plate. Popping it into her mouth, she wagged her finger at me in a gesture of chastisement. “You love it when I talk about the latest lingerie fashion in the muggle wor-”   I went ramrod straight, mouth parting on an intake of terror, face pulling into a look of pure annoyance to mask the amount of panic raging inside of my conscience. “May I proceed to announce to Hogwarts about you getting pummeled by Ronald Weasley, your most hated person on the planet?”   Pansy snapped her mouth shut then, jaw tightening as if she was trying to stop herself from wringing my neck. I internally snickered at her.   “It’s not my fault that you’re still a virgin and take much interest in living vicariously through me and my sexual experiences, doll face.” Pansy smiled.   I gave her a bland expression, once again dropping my cheek on my closed fist, pressing my lips together. “I have no idea what it is you're talking about, Pansy dear.” My voice was in a cadence of innocence.   Pansy flicked her nails over my nose, making me sniffle and slap away her spindly fingers from my face in irritation. “Don’t pretend that my secret sexcapade is not hot. That boy can fuck me over any professor's desk if he wanted to and I wouldn't stop him. You’re just jealous.”   I’m not fucking jealous. Sure, I can admit that Ronald Weasley who used to be a gangling, freckled, pale boy, has now turned into a massive body of muscle, sharp features and intimidating height. He was rather hot and I kind of hated Pansy for gaining that beast of a man’s attention. But I didn’t find attraction to the Weasley enough to be bitter about Pansy having him. One because he and I went at each others throats so much before that I only think of him as a ginger with serious anger management issues who still hates me but only tolerated me for Pansy’s sake.   The same thing went with Potter. He became like a viking, all tall and dark haired with emerald gleaming eyes and tanned skin. He was handsome and it felt like everyone got more gorgeous after beating Voldemort while I stayed the same skinny, obscenely too pale and odd eyed boy with freakish hair. It was even worse when I caught sight of Neville Longbottom being flanked by both guys and girls from all over Hogwarts and from all years because … well … he became sexy and gorgeous and terrifyingly beautiful.   For fucks sake!   “No I’m not.” I mumbled, absentmindedly moving my gaze in the most nonchalant manner that I could muster up as I searched for the man. Because Neville surely wasn’t that slightly chubby, awkward, pimple tooth gaped face of a boy before. No. Far from it.   My eyes landed on the Gryffindor table, where admittedly Potter and his gang all sat around. Neville was at the far right of the table, facing my person as his face angled down towards Luna Lovegood with his cupid bow shaped lips moving in a small chatter with the blonde woman.   I watched him.   Neville was tall, his figure looming over others with his lean and muscular build, the chord of his muscles tensing and shifting beneath the onslaught of his black long sleeved T-Shirt. The sleeves of his shirt was rolled up past his elbows, showing the straining veins against taut arms. His broad shoulders intimidating. I could make out his hard rock abs from beneath the fabric of his shirt whenever the material pressed up against his abdomen with each steady inhale and exhale of his breaths. He wore dark fitted jeans that shown off his long strong legs and muscular thighs.   Snape decided that the students could choose one day where they could dress however they wanted and then they would have to be in uniform for the rest of the week. It seemed Neville decided today was his "no uniform" day.   My eyes ran up the length of his body, taking in his strong jawline and sharp cheekbones, skin a smooth white as if he was carved out of the finest of marble. His hair was the color of dark chestnut and natural mahogany streaks, disheveled and tousled, such a dark rich tone of russet brown. His hair was cut above his ears but longs at the top, falling over his right hair enticingly.   And then his eyes. Those eyes of his reminded me of the beginnings of Stygian shadows, a play between a void full of abyss, black smoke mingling in with charcoal. They were obsidian chipped like that wolf’s fur from last night, gleaming and flooding with wisps of jasper and liquefied amber similar to that of melted honey. They were crystalline in their clash of dark and light, switching from one or the other and often mingling in together to create a chaos of differentiating colors.   He reminded me of so much of that werewolf.   Both magnetic and scorching in their frigid darkness and eyes the exact same.   I decided I wouldn’t think of that, it was weird and embarrassing. I’ve never been like that before, so fearful of something all the while deep in a heated state.   That never happened.   Neville Longbottom was also a man that was tortured during the war and helped beat Voldemort. Now he wore a mask of indifference though bringing with it a disarming charm that would make anyone around him feel drawn to his overwhelming presence but fear his every move. He had a nicety to him that felt like a heavy air weighing down on one’s shoulders, dragging them down in his suffocating aura. People liked Neville, but he was a mystery to everyone. The way he carried himself was lazed back and calm, but in the wake of his gaze and they way he watched those around them had me thinking of him as a predator, slinking and cornering his prey, so focused and unpredictable that one wouldn’t notice when he would snap.   “You’re staring at him again, Draco.” Pansy’s voice struck through my thoughts and had me ripping my eyes away from Neville as my chest constricted at the way he leaned in closer to Luna, all small smiles and faces absurdly too close to each other.   Whatever. I shouldn’t care about Neville Longbottom and who he associates himself with.   “I’m staring at that terrible hair of monstrosity that is sitting atop Granger’s head.” I snickered out, trying to act like I wasn’t just staring like a creeper at Neville.   Pansy clicked her tongue at me and I sneered at her for it. “Please, Granger’s got a shit ton of men coming after her because of how hot she is. I’m bisexual, trust me when I say she’s hot. And don’t fucking lie to me.”   I curled my lip up at her, digging my knuckles into my cheekbone in irritation. “I wasn’t staring at that thing called Neville.”   My best friend sighed exasperatedly, knowing that I wouldn’t say how weirdly interested I was in everything Neville Longbottom. Why was I thinking of him so much? I don’t know, he’s good looking, he scares me and for some fucked up reason I wanted to bathe in his smothering presence. He’s a fascination of mine.   I know he wouldn’t look twice at me. Besides I bullied him when we were little. Why would he want anything to do with me?   Pansy softly spoke then. “Neville is rather too good looking, like I’m gazing at some sort of greek god. But he’s also someone who’s hard to get close to. He’s charming but … scary? Ron says he’s changed immensely after the war.”   I pressed my lips over my knuckles, brushing them across the bottom lip’s skin as my gaze went back to stare off at the way Neville’s fingers tapped incessantly against the hard surface of the long dining table next to his empty plate.   I can’t be interested in him.   I’m not.   Running the tip of my tongue over my lip as I dragged the flesh out with the jut of my middle knuckle and tugging on it in a bad habit of mine, I whispered over to Pansy as I went to look at Neville’s eyes again. “He’s nothing special.”   My body jerked when I found Neville’s golden black gaze fixed directly on mine.   Pansy’s words were static behind my suddenly ringing ears but I tried to strain my hearing when she talked again. “Tell that to the entirety of the wizard world.”   I couldn’t do anything but freeze on the spot, body stiffening up and cock giving an enthusiastic thrum, blood rushing up my ears all the while.   Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck!   I felt like a bird trapped in its cage now, a mere bug beneath a microscope as I whipped my knuckles away from my parted lips, mostly over the strained bottom one to be exact so it could come back to my mouth as I tore my head sideways to take in a deep breathe and steady the harsh thump of my heart battering away at my rib cage.   Did he notice I was staring?   Oh god.   Noticing Pansy watching me with her signature raised brow, I let out a frustrated sigh and stood up from where I sat, quiet quickly and rather too noisy because I now felt most of the dining room’s students openly staring at me like I’ve lost my damn marbles. Which they have been doing since I’ve decided to come back and finish my school year at Hogwarts with the rest of the other Slytherins prideful or stubborn enough to come back.   I didn’t like the attention now.   Even the Slytherins who had come back hated me. I was the one that let Voldemort into the school and had him stay at my home as hideaway to stay and do his evil shit.   What everyone except Potter didn’t know was that I had only ever followed the flat nosed fuck because my father was working for him and the dark lord had threatened both my father and mother if I didn’t join in with my father as one of his soldiers. I couldn’t put my family at risk. My family was the only thing I had and now with father in Azkaban for the rest of his life and my mother’s mental state rotting in Malfoy Manor I practically had no one now.   I was only trying to survive and now I was hated for doing stuff that left me with more screams than laughter throughout my life.   Blaise called out to me and I internally cringed at his voice filtering over the room. “Better call your mommy to cuddle you, snake prince. You look like utter shite!”   The dining area burst out into fits of laughter, cackles ricocheting off the walls and high ceilings. Pansy, bless her, reared her head every which way to give a rather nice frigid stare at everyone before standing up too and standing beside me. “Let’s go.”   Nodding, I sucked up the pain prickling in my gut and gave a leering grin, so big and fake but knowing everyone would think it was real when I passed by with long strides, my head held up high as I ignored Blaise’s ringing words.       With a bite to my lip, I looked down one hallway to the next, chest heaving in time with the erratic rush of my blood.   I needed to shower.   And it was 3:13 in the morning, the only time I found that no one was in the boys shower rooms where I wouldn’t get fucking ambushed like the first time I tried to go.   I winced at the thought of that moment. I had came back to my room with bruises all over and blood flooding my mouth. But I didn’t tell anyone and made a cleansing potion that both healed and made me look like I wasn’t jumped like what really happened that night.   I wasn’t a snitch.   But I sure tried to get some semblance of sleep in before having my alarm clock wake me up and tell me to take a shower. This was the only time I could because, well … who the hell would be up taking a shower in Hogwarts at this time of the morning?   Clutching my freshly new pajamas and clean green towel, I sprinted across the hallway to the large corridors of the boys shower room to softly open and quickly but quietly shut it behind me.   With an impish grin splitting my features, I faced forward to start stripping in the middle of all the lockers, stepping out of my uniformed trousers, white button down shirt and green silken tie, I threw them on the bench in the middle of the slytherin colored lockers and padded barefooted across the linoleum floor to the end of the lockers where the row of showers appeared.   I was stark naked and the air brushing over my flesh caused goosebumps to erupt over my skin but I was too happy to finally get my awaited shower that I’ve been wanting throughout the whole day.   Once I was finished in the shower and stood in the warm water for more than necessary, I had walked on out to get to the bench where I also laid out my new pajamas only to stop dead in my tracks, dripping wet and water sluicing down the mess of my pale hair to create annoying dripping rhythms over the floor.   All of my clothes were gone.   Except for the ones neatly laid out.   A gryffindor's school uniform, specifically a girl one.   “H-huh?” Was all I could say when I felt my heart give one last thump before stopping altogether and leaving my body for a shuddering moment.   Was this another prank?   Who the hell could do this?!   “Fuck.” I seethed out, bottom lip quivering as I felt the disturbing oncoming ache behind my eye sockets, salt and liquid gathering there and blurring my vision in a mere second. Sucking in a sharp breath, I looked around my person to see if anyone was there but I couldn’t see anyone. Blinking rapidly to stop the tears that clogged at the back of my throat, I internally slammed my head against a brick wall and in reality, decided to walk back and forth in my sopping wet form.   There was no way I was going to step outside this room without any clothes on. I would definitely be made fun of my bare body and how pathetic I looked with the barely there muscles I had and my slim figure.   I mean, I liked wearing girl clothes. I figured that out when Pansy had me put on her school uniform when we were little and I loved the feeling of the silk against my skin and completely inhaling the sensation of being more delicate than I already was. I took an avid interest in it and father hated that I did while mother didn’t mind. I wore the muggle clothes Pansy would give me from her random trips because they were soft and made my body look … enticing than it really was.   But that was a secret.   A secret I liked kept hidden away for as long as I lived.   And having to be forced to wear a Gryffindor girl uniform may show others that I didn’t mind wearing these sorts of things. Like I was scared they would see right through me and know that I actually enjoyed wearing a skirt.   Fuck.   Also, having a Malfoy heir walk around in public with girl clothes on wouldn’t take well to the wizard world and I knew everyone would turn their attention to me more so than it already was and make my life an even more living hell.   I couldn’t disgrace the family name like that.   Mother already had so much shit to deal with.   But it was worse to be made fun of for the bare expanse of my skin and bones rather than the outline of it through girl clothes. I didn’t like being naked in front of others. Voldemort had me change in front of him for his sick entertainment once. He didn’t touch me, but he did one day promise me he would and that … that terrified me and not in a way that Neville did.   He was dead though. Potter, Ron, Granger, Neville … they killed him.   Being naked in front of everyone was a lot more tedious than being caught in a schoolgirl uniform. No one needed to see my  everything.   Fuck.   I'm really going to go through with this. Maybe I could destroy any evidence of my attire tonight before having it shown in public.   Taking in a shaky breath, I cursed beneath quietly to myself as I went to snatch up the pleated skirt and step into it. The tiny waist of the skirt rose up across my legs and shimmied over my thighs and over my hip bones, fitting snug tight around my waist. It flared out over the curve of my ass where the bottom hem of its flare brushed against the space between my arse cheeks and thighs met, coming a little bit above mid thigh and so fucking short.   What’s worse was that I had no underwear. The skirt was dark red with black stripes to create a checkered design. Gryffindor colors. It fitted me unnervingly well and I couldn’t help but rub the soft material between my thumb and index finger, breath hitching as the fabric swept over my naked cock.   This feels nice.   Shaking my head minutely, I grew red at my own thoughts and decided to hurry up and put on the black sheer, crisscross stockings that met a little above the knee and felt like second skin around my legs and thighs, nicely fit and ridiculously soft where it shown bits and pieces of my pale skin. It left a huge gap between the bottom of the skirt and the tops of my stockings to show the bare skin of my thighs. The Gryffindor school girl uniform didn't allow such gaudy stockings though. Whoever was doing this to me surely wanted to make a fool out of me.   I bit down on my lip when I reached for the top, which was black and rode up past my belly button with long sleeves, this fitting to my petite frame and the subtle curves that Pansy had once told me made me look like a girl if anyone knew how I looked like beneath all my clothes. All the Gryffindor women wore this kind of shirt with their house colored cardigans over it, which I didn't get. I was left exposed.   And then there were the dark red heels to match with the skirt.   I loved heels.   Fuck.   Not the time to admire. I was about to get mortified here in a second.   Gritting my teeth in frustration, I slipped on the heels and staggered a bit in them, not liking how my chest warmed as I looked down at myself and made a tiny squeak at my appearance.   I shouldn’t like this.   Why was I doing this?   Oh yeah, so I didn’t have to go out naked because that’s a large fear of mine.   But I like the feeling of these soft feminine clothes …   Something is definitely wrong with me.   Licking my lips, I brushed my drying hair out of my eyes and made my way to the doors to slowly open them and peek out to check if anyone was there. I know someone would be there, waiting to make fun of me because how else would I have gotten these clothes. Someone or a group of people were out to make my life worse than it already was.   I could always run for it back to my dorm room.   With that in mind, I slammed the doors open and booked it down the hallway opposite from where I exited and ran with a staggered pace because running in heels was gods awful!   That’s when I heard low laughter following behind me, causing me to look behind my shoulder to see Blaise and the other Slytherin’s holding up lit up wands and making chants that were the embodiment of taking pictures of my skirt clad figure.   One of the Slytherin boys whistled as I turned my head back around and gulped around a mouthful of bile. “If I didn’t know any better, I would have mistaken you for a girl and fucked that nice arse of yours, Draco!”   Letting out a pathetic sob, I felt my vision go completely watery as I swiftly turned around a corner to get out of view from the guys who didn’t seem to care to chase me because they probably got their pictures. With my jaw tightening in an effort to keep myself from crying, because dammit I would not cry, I raced up spiraling staircases that did not belong to the Slytherin dorms but to the Gryffindor ones to jog up the steps and speak their house password at their entrance door and into the red lounge room.   I knew the password because I was a curious little bugger who wanted to know everything.   Slamming the door shut behind me, I breathed out a trembling sigh, trying to catch my breath as I leaned my forehead against the door’s surface, sleek wood and polished Italian cut.   “What are you doing here?” A deep, low murmur spoke right at the skin of my bent neck, hot air skating across the bared flesh.   I yelped out in surprise, turning on my heel to twitch back with widened eyes. The voice, like warm milk frothing in drizzling honey and rubbing over my spine like sinfully silken sheets, carried a rumble, booming and spreading out through my chest at the sheer strength of the low tone that emitted out around me. It had my muscles tightening up in anticipation and consternation.   And I had to tilt my head back and look up from beneath my lashes at the looming frame of the one and only Neville Longbottom.   He wore black trousers and an unbuttoned white long sleeved shirt that, showing off the expanse of his bare chest, a line of hard abs and sinuous muscles on display with his defined pecs. And there were tattoos, intricately woven with each curve and sharp turn of its blackened ink, sleeves rolled up like this afternoon but this time, showing ink that ran and curled up his strong forearms and disappeared beneath the sleeves.   Neville has tattoos? Does he charm himself to not show them during school hours? He had to. Why wouldn't he want to show them?   My thoughts were interrupted when my gaze shifted down Neville's frame, taking in how Neville's trousers were riding low, exposing the sharp V-Dip of his hips, defined angled slopes that narrowed and disappeared beneath the hemline of his trousers. Neville’s hair was even messier than what I’ve seen of it before..   I gaped up at him like a fish out of water.   “Answer me.” Neville’s tremor of a demand incited a jerk of my spine and my back to collide with the door behind me.   I tried not to cower back because being in front of Neville and getting a full frontal of his presence has my head reeling and my mouth moving without my say so, a flicker of nerve induced sarcasm passing my parted mouth. Really bad habit of mine. “It's none of your business, Longbottom.”   I pressed further into the door frame despite the words spewed out of my lips. It was a reflex. To become a bitch to cover up the sudden waves of anxiety flowing through my veins because a Malfoy does not show weakness and even though I ran from my fellow Slytherin classmates, I didn’t give them the chance to see the unshed tears that were practically trying to claw their way out of my eye sockets.   I would not let anyone see how much I was affected by everything happening to me, especially not to fucking Neville Longbottom. The man who seems to consume every thought of mine since coming back to this hell hole.   Neville raised his dark brows, taking a step in towards my figure as he tilted his head, the silky strands of his brown locks brushing across the smooth skin of his forehead as flaxen eyes gazed down at me with such unnerving intensity. “You’re one to talk since you just barged into the Gryffindors quarters when you’re a Slytherin. And especially because it seems that you aren’t leaving anytime soon. So explain.”   Narrowing my eyes up at Neville, I let out a sneer that I didn’t feel. “I’ll get out soon. This has nothing to do with you.”   I let out a wheeze of a gasp when hot, warm, large hands went in between my legs to grip my upper thigh where it met my pelvic bone, very close to my exposed cock. The back of my head slammed over the door as I flailed on the spot. Neville grasped me there, squeezing with such a strong hold that the tips of his fingers dug into the meat of my thigh and left crescent moon shapes from his nails.   Heat poured over my body then, but the surprise and fear laced in with the burst of warmth coiling low in my gut had my mouth pressed tight together to keep myself from crying out at the hot touch of Neville’s rough hands.   Neville lent down, back hunching and showing the sharp, muscular edges of his shoulder blades as he suddenly crowded into my space, squeezing my thigh within his death grip as he levelled his face with mine, lips a few millimeters from mine to the point where I could smell him. An intoxicating scent of musky forest, cigar smoke and mint rolled off of Neville’s intimidating frame, causing my breath to hitch in time with the twitch of my cock beneath the soft fabric of my skirt. My eyes threatened to roll to the back of my head with the abrupt dizzying smell flooding my every thought and making the muscles in my legs strain underneath Neville’s fingers.   “Ah.” I let out a tiny rush of sound to tear from my gaping mouth when Neville dug his fingers further into my leg. I winced, the discomfort erupting over my features from the pain lacing into my flesh. “Stop it! Y-you’re hurting me, Gryffindork!”   I tried kicking my legs out, only to yelp when Neville hauled my leg forward and pushed me back in a harsh impact, my teeth rattling when my head slammed against the door frame and gasping out as I felt my other thigh being clutched by Neville's other hand and I found myself being lifted up off of my feet. I yelled out in surprise, laden heat coursing through my veins.   Neville brought my back up the door frame, my heart thundering wildly in my chest as I wriggled in his iron grasp, mouth falling open to heave in air that I felt like I was immensely starving of at this very moment.   Straightening his posture, Neville hovered over me, looming and scorching in those dark, obsidian chipped eyes of his. I struggled in Neville’s hands, still gripping my thighs beneath my skirt and my eyes so stricken wide in their audacity at such a rough behavior inflicted upon my person and the fact that I was throbbing by said actions.   I could feel the concealed ominous tensions lining his tensed figure, a dark calmness falling over his emotionless expression and I felt that same trapped sensation fall into the pit of my gut just like that night with the werewolf.   Where was the charming man everyone knew?   A tremor ricocheted over my flesh as I cried out as the biting manner of Neville’s nails into my thighs.   Lifting my hands up, I shoved at Neville’s broad, hard chest, only to let out a frustrated scream when the damn Gryffindor didn’t move a single inch.   Panic rose up my spine, sidling along the length with an embarrassing dose of shame at how much my heart was practically beating like a violent drum beneath my chest in time with the quick thrum of blood flooding in my hardening cock.   “I want you to apologize for that tone of yours. Now.” Neville’s voice dropped to an unbelievable octave. The sound elicited my back to arch as I pushed feebly at the man’s shoulders.   Panting, I stared at him with shocked eyes, my face hot. “How dare you! I d-don’t have to do a-a-anything you say, you-”   He heaved me forward in a whipping motion, almost causing my neck to snap as I was forced into the door once again in a blur of movement, my vision swimming behind my rapidly blinking lids. I bit down on my bottom lip, mouth quivering on a sharp cry when I glanced down to see my skin split from Neville’s burrowing fingers around my thighs. I blew out a shaky breath as I sneered at the man, his figure all dark and foreboding, terrifying and … inevitably handsome.   I couldn’t talk now, astonished and shaking from a rush of adrenaline with a healthy dose of apprehension. My skin felt taut, tension and warmth choking me in their wake. “I could just push you out this door and leave you out there so anyone could to take pictures of your slutty figure.” Neville toned lowly, a low rumble and a flash of and molten gold rendering me chewing harder on my lip, staring up at his large person from beneath my lashes in mortification and dread.   Slutty.   Why did that sound so nice coming from Neville’s mouth? Why wasn't I furious at what he just called me!?   Ugh.   I was not going to apologize to Neville fucking Longbottom of all people. But every time I felt like protesting, it was as if Neville knew that I would and stop me by tightening his hands around me even more.   It hurt.   And I was burning in his hands.   Oh fuck.   Furrowing my brows, I clutched at the material of his shirt, fisting them in my shaking curled hands to give him a narrowed eye look that I couldn’t feel an ounce of as I tried to stop myself from lilting my hips up that barest inch left between his pelvis and mine so I could grind against him like a cat in heat.   Neville stared me down and I was scared.   I was fearful of the way my cock was hard as a rock and threatening to brush at Neville’s hip, of the way that I was in trepidation around this man yet I was getting off on his rough treatment towards me.   And for some reason, I knew that Neville would go through with his threat without any hesitation. I don’t want to be put in any more humiliation than I already was in with the entirety of Hogwarts. I know that the Slytherin boys were looking for me still and they would never think that I would have found solace in the Gryffindor towers.   I wasn’t safe anywhere, but at least I wouldn’t have to be around my stupid former housemates.   Releasing my bottom lip from my mouth, I caught Neville’s gaze flickering and thought I saw them running over the skin of my lip but it was so quick it was probably just my imagination. Shifting beneath Neville’s tight grasp, I released a sound of distress at the sharp prickles of pain lacing down my shaking thighs.   This was horrible.   Why was I turned on!?   Anymore proximity with Neville would make me do stuff I would definitely regret.   “I-I’m sorry.” My voice was barely audible to my own ears. It was a surprise that Neville even heard me with the way he released my hurting legs and dropped me to the floor on the flat of my feet.   I squeaked out when my knees all but wobbled and I found my lower half weak as I all but slid down the length of the door and flat on my ass.   It was as if every single strength in my body was drained from Neville’s touch and I couldn’t bare to move a miniscule of a muscle. I could feel my blush spreading down my chest then as I looked up and watched Neville go back into that casual demeanor of his, not that alarmingly nerve-racking menacing persona. I watched the chords of his tattooed arms flex as he shoved his hands into his trousers pockets and watched me with an expression I couldn’t place.   My mouth was hanging open as I had to tilt my head back and stare at him with no response in my box full of wits.   I was stunted. And the skirt was tented with my straining erection.   Neville raised his brows at me, causing me suck in air and lift my arms to cross them over my groin. I was as red as the skirt I wore. My mouth flapped open and closed like a gaping fish in an attempt to explain why I was hard of all times but I couldn’t emit an explanation and instead, I had blurted out why I was here in the first place, feeling like I had to after everything that happened since I got into this fucking room.   I was tired and Neville did ask about why Iq was here and my not telling him had brought the incident of my now bruising and cut up thighs.   “I’m giving you three hours to stay in here since no one comes into the lounge room until eight. It should be enough time for the Slytherins to get tired of waiting for your pathetic person and let you go back to your room.” Neville drawled as if he was utterly bored with me.   I didn't even ask for his help.   Deciding to not make Neville mad again, I went with a whispered “Fine.”   Neville then turned his back to me and started to walk towards the stairs that led to the thousands of Gryffindor dorm rooms. As he tracked up the steps, he spoke out to me, a deep tremor that shook in my chest. “Watch your damn mouth when you speak to me and make sure you’re not seen in that outfit when you leave.”   He paused as he almost disappeared from my sight, tone giving out a husk that caused my knees to quiver on the spot and gasp at his next words. “No one will see those pictures. I’ll make sure of it, but you have to pay me back, blondie. Better take care of that erection.”  With that he was gone and I was trying not to hyperventilate in this red room.

Waking up to the looks of narrowed eyes, scrunched noses, and snarling mouths from my Slytherin classmates was an odd sensation. I was used to the way the academy looked at me now, with hate and disgust, but I wasn’t prepared for the amount of malice that rolled in ferocious waves from their every pore over the expanse of my clothed skin.  When lunchtime came, I sat with Pansy as usual, cautious to the way the whole of the Slytherin table were glaring daggers at me, even more than they usually did.   I’m guessing the pictures from last night didn’t get out because no one had said or put them up at all and by the looks directed my way, they were angry about it.   Did that mean that Neville went through with his words? How did he manage that? What the hell would I have to owe Neville? Why must I have to do what he requires?   I couldn’t.   There was no way I would do what he wanted.   And what the hell was that nickname he gave me?!   Blondie.   Indecent, arrogant, intimidating asshole.   I didn’t ask him to make sure the pictures didn’t get out, he did that on his own free will. I made no deal so I don’t need to follow his so called “demand”.   Rolling my bottom lip into my mouth, I jabbed at the skin there as I whipped my gaze around in a paranoid state of mind, a sensation of dizzying heat and a prickling ache of tenseness settling in my flesh in a state of panic.   I could feel someone watching me, with more hate and heat than those that were already glaring my way.   With my breath heaving out of my mouth, I looked across the table to Pansy who was clad in the slytherin girls uniform with a piece of treacle tart coating the corner of her glossed lips. She gave me a curious expression that made me settle my gaze directly over her shoulder to avoid her questioning look. Popping her mouth, Pansy sighed. “You look like you’re about to puke, darling. Sickly pale is not a good look on you and with how light skinned you already are, you’ll be turning into a ghost soon. What’s the matter?”   I shook my head, letting my eyes wander over to the Gryffindor table behind Pansy and catching sight of Luna Lovegood staring straight at my best friend. Her blond curls were piled high up atop of her head in an elegant chiffon, bright blue eyes similar to that same dreamy sense she possessed, although there was a focus in them, more pronounce and lacking less sympathy than that whispy expression she seemed to always give away. Her head was tilted, lips set into a straight line. Luna seemed thoughtful as she gazed at Pansy from behind.   Her blue eyes held a twinge of a shadow over them, all attention upon Pansy’s form.   Gritting my teeth together, I let out a rush of air in annoyance at Luna’s open ogling at my best friend and decided to focus on Pansy instead, completely ignoring Luna. Usually Neville was with Luna though. He wasn’t there at the table yet. Or perhaps he wouldn’t be there today all.   “I think Luna’s been eyeing your loveliness as we speak, Pansy.” I spoke out softly, changing the subject in an attempt to rid of any conversation having to deal with what exactly was wrong with me at the moment.   Everything. But I wasn’t going to be talking about my problems. Never.   Pansy blinked at me in surprise, her usually upturned nose shifting down in a look of genuine astonishment and confusion. Her brows drawn in as she looked sideways, avoiding my stare now. “Don’t be absurd. Luna Lovegood is too far in her own mind to pay any attention to those around her.”   Did I just hear the slightest stubborn rejection in my best friend’s tone?   Yes.   A grin, tiny and mischievous spread out over my face then. “Why dear, I think you have a crush on that fluffy Gryffindor woman.”   Pansy gave me a dark glare. “Shut your trap. She’s anything but in the category of ‘fluffy’.”   I snickered at that, in a sort of awe at the way Pansy was actually saying the Luna was opposite of what she looked like. But I could see it. Luna was always good at hiding things from others. “Perhaps she wants to lay you down and have her wicked way with you?”   Pansy proceeded to gape at me, her jaw dropping and an undeniable flush of red coating her delicate features. I grinned wider at that. “H-how dare you s-suggest such a thing!”   I couldn’t help but let a small laugh bubble up out of my throat, a giddiness at my interaction between Pansy. I missed it when we were younger and could care less about keeping up appearances and be more carefree with how we carried ourselves. It was a rare time when her and I could act like this in public because I sure as hell hated showing any sign of emotion in any social gatherings. But right now, I just had to soak this in.   I was the one to now gape at my best friend when a sharp jab went to my shin beneath the table and I got a pointed look from her doe like eyes. “I’ll have your head decapitated if that leaves a mark.” I hissed at her in a playful manner.   She rolled her eyes at my dramatic astonishment at her action. “Maybe leaving marks on your body could help you fit in more with everyone. You’re skin is ridiculously creamy looking. Maybe dirtying you up would do you good.”   I clicked my tongue in response.   Catching sight of everyone getting up and already getting back to classes, I sighed in relief to know that Neville wasn’t coming for me after all. I profusely tried to reason with myself that the harsh thud of my heart against my chest in a throb of pain at the disappointment that clouded over my thoughts for that brief second, was just a small hiccup in my health department. I guess Neville forgot all about me. That’s good though. I wouldn’t have to do what he tells me to, it’s not like I would even if he showed up and told me to do what he wanted without my say so in it. Why the hell should I be upset?   Maybe because that was your only chance to be near him.   Standing up from my bench seat, I waved towards Pansy in a gesture for a dismissal and turned to head on over towards my next class.   Guess I was home free.       In Potions class, I decided that when I die, I would haunt each and every one of the students in this room until they themselves died from a heart attack from utter fear of my ghostly figure.  Potter and his group of friends thought it was a great idea to summon a shit ton of glitter as a means to celebrate the end of the first semester and to off us classmates to our week of Christmas vacation.  Weasley, the big oaf, had thought he got the potion right but I watched as he made one tick of a mistake while stirring the damn thing and somehow, all that glitter plopped itself right onto me.  I blankly stared out at the cawing hoots and laughter jeering all around me. Surprisingly, the golden trio didn't play along and instead, Granger came towards me with that confident stride of hers. Her auburn hair a mass of curls and falling down her back in long waves with burgundy tinged eyes.  I did my best to give her my death glare although she didn't seem one bit fazed as she came swaying her hips on over my way to give me a raise of her brows before she let that amused expression fall from her face and replaced it with a wry grin, a look of shame and an apology flitting in her eyes.  “We're sorry. We didn't expect that to happen. Ronald feels quite bad for that and Harry wasn't paying attention as always. I look away for one second and the boys get themselves into a mess again.” Granger placed her hands on her hip in consternation.  I looked at her from beneath the glitter flecked strands of my hair, sniffling in faked disdain as I eyed her with slit eyes. “No need to apologize if you don't mean it, Granger. And if Weasley is actually sorry, he can say that to my face without having sent you off to do it.”  Granger let out a put upon sigh after a moment as her eyes rushed across every surface of my face. I didn't like being assessed so openly but that's because I did that with others. It was different when it was done to me. I felt too exposed and … nervous.  “You're full of shit, Malfoy. But I do agree that Ron should apologize although you know he's got his pride so far up his arse like you do,” Granger let her smile turn into a sharp grin “and I can see that nice blush you have under all that wonderful glitter, so no need to give me that sneer of yours to cover up your embarrassment.”  I rolled my eyes, grimacing on the inside at her blunt exposure of my mortification. “Must I remind you that my arse is perfectly fine and has no such thing shoved up inside unlike that stick lodged up yours. Go away Granger, I don't need your pity.” I murmured.  Granger shook her head. “You may want to rethink your words. Someone I know would take them to heart and make sure you do have something up that pert ass of y-”  I hadn't noticed Potter popping up out of nowhere near Granger until his low voice interrupted her words. I couldn't have stopped my eyes from widening as my own mind finished Granger’s vulgar words. Who the hell would think like that about me!? And I always thought that Granger had somewhat of a mind similar to a Slytherin. I didn't know whether I should feel proud that a Gryffindor could say such things or fume at the thought that Granger was getting the last word on me, although interrupted.  “I'll fix you right up, Malfoy.” Potter mumbled, green eyes apologetic and already whipping out his wand.  I was not going to let him do me any more favors than he already had done. I owed him enough already.  Before Potter could so much as get the chant out of his mouth, I stood up from my chair with a resounding clatter and stalked towards the door. “Don't you dare help me, Potter. And Granger, better fix that rats nest of a hair of yours before secretly meeting up with your boyfriend, Theodore Nott.” I harshly spat out to the two whom I passed in a flurry of motion.  I caught Potter's lips twitching as if he was profoundly entertained by something while Granger turned beet red and gave me her signature frown. I did see her eyes light up more though, as if she was happy with the fact that I had insulted her and gave away her kept secret. I had no idea why.  My ass was out the door and heading towards Pomfrey's office so I could get cleaned up since I wasn't allowed to have nor wield my wand.  The professor for Potions often allowed me to leave because I was damn good at the subject and was far ahead of the students. I tolerated the new professor as much as I was willing to and got free passes on the class whenever I wanted. So walking out of the class was no problem. I swear the new potions professor was the only teacher that liked me.  And why wasn’t Neville is class today? The professor went right over his name when he was calling attendance and just went on with the others.  Chewing on my lip, I trekked down the large corridor with a sort of slow gate, vision shifting into a remembrance of the clothes I wore last night, how the skirt was soft in contrast with the slacks I wore now, the top shaping around my torso in a delicate manner against my small frame.  I shoved the uniform into the back of my rooms closet.  What was wrong with me? I shouldn’t have liked the way those clothes felt, but … they … felt so good.  “You should be more observant of your surroundings.”  I gasped out in shock at the familiar low baritone. It resonated through my body like the heat of alcohol settling into your stomach and veins, poisonous and intoxicating in its sheer overhaul.  I stumbled on my own two feet, trying to figure out where the voice came from only to skid to a halt in my actions as I caught sight of a silhouette, tall, lean and muscled, hidden in the depths of the corner to the end of the hall.  Amber lit eyes gazed back at me, eerily glowing.  I swallowed around a constricting throat, clutching the strap of my satchel against my hip in a white knuckled grasp. The thrum of my pulse immediately heightened, loud and obnoxious in  my chest in time with the breaths trying to escape the very confines of my mouth with how fast I was suddenly breathing.  The mere presence of Neville had my body going out of sorts without my say so.  “Well it’s not my fault you’re a creeper, Longbottom. Seriously? Are you trying to live in the corners of every wall in Hogwarts. You’ll end up turning into one if you keep doing such a horrid act.” I thanked whatever deity that I didn’t stutter one bit, although I said this all in a somewhat breathless pace.  I took a step back when Neville tilted forward on the soles of his feet, head bowed and eyes now hooded from the brown locks of his hair, mussed up and looking like he just rolled out of bed. My fingers twitched reflexively at the sheer want to run them through his hair.  I need to get my head checked.  I saw that Neville was wearing his uniform, red shirt with its buttons popped open at the the top to reveal his collarbones and broad beginnings of his chest, his shirt tails out of his black fitted slacks. His long sleeves were rolled up again, but no tattoos shown.  Why was Neville trying to cover up his ink so much? And holy hell, why did he have to look like that?!  I sucked on my bottom lip, trying to keep the weakened sound escaping my mouth at the sight of him.  Fuck.  “Someone could take an advantage of you like this. Without anyone near to help, powerless in that tidied up slytherin uniform of yours.” Neville toned lowly. I inhaled a large amount of stifling air when he flicked his hand out, pointer finger lazily sweeping sideways in a gesture towards my figure as the illuminate shade of black and gold of his eyes flickered like a candlelight in the dark of the corridor. “What’s with the glitter?”  I frowned at Neville’s words.  “You’re Gryffindork friends, specifically the golden trio, attempted to make glitter fall like confetti for a celebration to the upcoming week of vacation and end of semester but Weasley messed up and I was the only one dunked with it.” I sneered at him.  “Makes you look like a pretty little pixie.” Neville intoned lowly, hint of amusement in that monotonous drawl of his.  I glared at his dark figure, gritting my teeth together at the rush of blood filling my face once again. “Fuck you. Don’t compare me to a creature. And don’t call me pretty.” I spat out.  Being called pretty made me mad when someone else said it, knowing they were just making fun of me but when Neville said it, I got extremely pissed and embarrassed because it made a shiver of warmth coil deep into my gut and induce itself into my cock, aroused all of the sudden. I didn’t like that Neville could get such a reaction out of me. Hated that I couldn’t control myself around him.  “Do you imagine that often? Me fucking you, why, you’re a dirty ponce brat aren’t you?” Neville’s voice dropped lower, switching into a satisfied note that had my toes curling in on themselves in my shoes.  “Th-that’s not what I m-meant,” I stuttered “what do you w-want, Longbottom?”  The man was silent, causing my body to tighten up in tense caution and that annoying jolt of fear racing down my spine at Neville’s lack of a response. I waited him out though, lungs aching with the amount of strain I put on them in my effort to stop breathing and not make any move.  Why was I constantly feeling like prey with a predator in front of me?  “I’m here to collect my dues. You owe me for the pictures, Blondie.” Neville murmured darkly.  I clicked my teeth together. “I don’t owe you anything if I never asked for your help. You just went right along and did what you wanted.”  “I’ll just pass the copies around then, shall I?” Neville mused.  I gaped at him. “Y-you made copies?! What-I, you, how dare you!” To make matters worse than my sudden outburst and lack of self control, I stomped my foot like a three year old.  Neville leaned against the wall, crossing his arms over his chest with a relaxed form, all calm and collected and making me want to scream in frustration at his unfazed demeanor. Also at myself when my cock throbbed in time with my fast heart beat as I saw the way Neville’s muscles flexed with such an eased movement.  Kill me now.  “I could make them pop up in each classroom if I wanted to right about now.” Neville mocked me.  I clutched my bag tighter. “No. Don’t. What do you want?”  Neville let out a low chuckle, a sound that had my mouth popping open to release of a breath of astonishment and surprise at hearing such a delicious, amused sound. My skin felt like it was being licked by fire by that simple action. “Good boy.” He replied.  A flush threatened to spread out even more over my cheeks at Neville’s praise.  Good boy.  My thighs quivered at the way Neville curled his tongue around his words, my cock rising from beneath the confines of my slacks, heart hammering wildly against my chest and making my breath stutter out the slightest bit.  I tried to keep my focus.  “I need proof that you have the pictures first, and then I-I’ll do what you want.” I was trying to have the upper hand here. It was like I was grasping at open air.  Neville shook his head. “Don’t argue with me on this. I have them and they’re a moment away from being seen by every eye that lives here. So do yourself a favor and do as I say.” His tone lowered into a threatening prominence and I about turned into a mush of limbs right then and there.  Chest heaving up and down, I tried to form a snarl from my upturned lips but it probably looked more like a cringe. “Alright.” I gritted out.  Neville tilted his head, those eyes of his following the tremor in my hand that grabbed at my satchel. “Over winter break, you are to meet up with me every day at five to twelve at midnight. You are to show up at my mansion and clean my house because my elves are out on their own vacation and I have meetings to attend.”  My lips parted as I stared at him in horror. “I don’t know how to clean. And I am not a servant of yours!”  I took a step back and about fell over when I looked away for only a moment to come face to face with Neville, his form leaned down so he could watch me at eye level, body looming over my trembling figure. And that’s when I saw it.  The demand, prominent and full force spilling from amber flecked eyes, hot and heavy and dripping with rough prominence.  My breath left my body at that look in this man’s eyes before me.  My stomach did a ferocious dip, the marks he left on me from last night seeming to light up at the close proximity of Neville’s body all over again. My cock was hard beneath my pants, painfully so and a sob of fear tore from my open mouth.  “O-okay.” I whispered, voice shaking.  What have I done?  And I gave in so easily.  I couldn’t move even if I wanted to. I was stuck, rendered beneath Neville’s searing eyes. My face hot as well as tingles ruptured over my skin in taunting waves. I wanted to do something, but I didn’t know what, stuck between running away or pleading. For what? I didn’t know.  But I was scared, not like when I was around Voldemort. I didn’t fear him in that way, but Neville brought about a cautiousness in me in a way that made me want to hide from him, mentally and physically. Voldemort didn’t scare me with my conscience, but with my body. He always looked at me like he wanted to hurt me, but Neville looked … ravenous, wild and untamed. He looked animalistic in that piercing stare of his. He looked like he wanted to open me up and poke and prod around until I was raw in his grasp.  Like that werewolf.  It was as if he knew exactly what I was thinking and that didn’t settle well with me.  “See you then, Blondie.” Neville muttered.  And then he apparated, just like Potter does, wandless and effortlessly.  I was utterly fucked.     When I got back in my dorm room, I found a sealed letter placed precariously atop of my pillow.  Opening the fine, creamy red envelope, I took out a single piece of rectangular paper decked out in black with blood red words embedded into the small piece. It took me a couple of good minutes to further read the beautifully scrawled words, neat and refined with the contrasting matching Gryffindor colors. I ran the tips of my fingers against the sharp edges, smelling that hint of forest, mint and smoke hovering all over the letter and envelope.  A sharp dip whooshed into my gut, a warm, energized sensation spreading out over my groin and navel.  Neville.  I read the crimson words.  Blondie,     I assume you’ve figured out whom this letter belongs to, so I won’t have to go through the trouble of writing more than I have to. This is the address to my house.                     03961366 Canterbury, England                  Xeyrus Mansion     At the front gate, press the button on your right and state your name. Not the nickname you have gotten when entering Hogwarts for the first time. No. Your real name. The gate will open and you may take the black convertible up to the front entrance.   Burn this letter when you’re done reading. Remember everything I’ve told you, the address and instructions.     Don’t be late,     Rhayden     I ran my eyes over the same words, unconsciously doing what I was told through the letter and letting my conscience suck in the phrases, patterns, sounds and images that I could associate with said address, numerals, and intriguing information to my own thoughts.  When I deemed that I had every detail burned into the back of my skull, I jogged down the Slytherin steps of my dorm room level and tossed the beautiful envelope and its letter into the flames of our common room lounge.  Rhayden.  Was that Neville’s name? His real name? I opened my mouth to let my lips form around the pronunciation of his name, a wisp of breath leaving my lungs and speaking that one phrase that brought upon curiosity and a sort of exaltation . “Rhayden.”  I bit down on my lip, a shiver cascading down my spine.  There was a sort of frustration in my words as I spoke Neville’s real name. Because it made me want to know more about him and I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to be interested more than I already was. I don’t like him. And how did he know Draco was a nickname I picked up when I came to Hogwarts as a child? Did that mean he knew the real name that my mother thought embodied me and was a name that my great grandmother helped with choosing? Only my parents knew my real name, Saveri Draconis Aleeysius Malfoy . And usually mansions were named after the surname of those who own it. Was Rhayden’s last name … Xeryus ?  Fuck.  Why did my stupid Slytherin classmates have to go and make me wear a stupid Gryffindor’s girl uniform and make me run into a man who isn’t who he really is. Like me. I just had to get myself into all this difficulty again. Always getting myself into trouble without really having put much effort into doing so.  Pansy constantly said that I just looked like someone that needs to be messed with, with my spoilt attitude and pretty face making others want to hurt me. Fuck that little pompous bitch for saying that about me. No one messes with a Malfoy dammit and if Rhayden thought that he could push me around when I’m visiting his Mansion, he’s got another thing coming to him. I’ll fulfill his demands for compensation in helping me, but that is it.  I had to go through with my words.  Shaking off the feeling of my heart scattering about inside the cage of my ribs at the little nudge in the back of my head telling me that I was going to be completely wrong about consenting to following Rhayden’s orders, I fidgeted with the bottom hem of my shirt.  I’m a Malfoy. I could this.  But the only thought in my head as I was packing my stuff to go back to Malfoy Mansion to visit mother, was the way my voice had sounded so utterly breathless when I spoke out Neville’s real name.  "Rhayden." I whispered, anxious and warmed.      Pansy made me promise that I’d visit her during Winter Break and I told her I’d try my best considering the fact that I had to go see Rhayden everyday every afternoon until midnight. I was going to ask him if I could at least have one day off to hang out with my best friend.   Arriving at the Malfoy Manor in just a day, I found my mother seated in the pristine lounge chair decked out in elegance with her same pale hair though greying now although she still carried an unearthly beauty about herself.   A tumbler of whisky, bubbling and jaded was caught in a loose grasp in the long fingered curl of my mother’s lazed hand. Pale blue eyes stared at me with that faraway look, as if she was in my presence but she was completely elsewhere. Ever since Father had been sentenced to life in Azkaban, mother has started to deteriorate physically because she couldn’t find it in her to try most of the days. I had to send her constant letters from Hogwarts to make sure she was doing okay.   Would I end up like her? Having to deal with so much hatred from everyone and never obtain that one happiness that could get anyone through just about anything. Mother’s happiness was in both me and father, but now since she’s lost a piece of that, she hasn’t been the same. It was like I was talking to a wall half the time, other times it felt like I was talking to the mother I’ve always had. But I did love her despite her leaving me to deal with the press, the wizard media, news and social gatherings during the long summer. Now she had an assistant living around the house to help her with those daily requirements and I still worried.   “I’m home, mother.” I spoke softly towards her relaxed figure across the couch.   Narcissa Malfoy tilted her head as she watched me from her perch, lips pursing as a flash of recognition of her surroundings came about herself, that dazed look shifting away. “Saveri, my darling son, I’m happy to see that you made it home safe and without harm.” Her tone was that same airy, confident stride that seeped into my bones and made me feel stable enough to do just about anything for my mother. Hence the reason why I tried so hard to do what Voldemort wanted me to because I needed to protect that one person who made me feel strong when I didn’t believe in myself one bit. I tried doing the same for father but he still only cared for himself. Especially when he offered me to-   I mentally shook my head, trying to rid myself of any impending thoughts that I absolutely could not go back to.   Pressing my lips together, I straightened my back to give me some sort of steady illusion of any inner strength that I didn’t feel any ounce of. Pulling on a small smile, I nodded towards my mother. “Thank you. I’m sure that you’ve been keeping yourself busy like always. I do have to forewarn you though, I’ve got a daily meeting with an acquaintance so I won’t be home from five until midnight.” I rushed out the last statement.   Get that out of the way and all.   Mother raised her brows then, a look of open curiosity passing her elf like features. Aunt Bellatrix, that psychotic relative of mine who I dearly loved despite everything she’s done and is now dead, used to say how I got my looks from my mother and that stubborn attitude from both mother and father. I wonder if I looked as tired as my mother now.   “Now who is this person to take away my son for themselves for such a long time? Do you have a strapping, handsome man that you haven’t told me about?” I could hear the genuine giddiness laden in her wispy voice.   Heart warmed my cheeks and I turned my head away from her gaze, biting down on the insides of my cheeks as I stared through the marbled entrance to one of our many living rooms. “Don’t think such nonsense mother. The man is from Hogwarts and we have to work on a potions project that’s due the day we get back to school.”   “With they way you are blushing and avoiding eye contact with your own mother, I think you're full of utter shite, my dear boy.” Mother’s crass words wasn’t an abnormal countenance between us. Her and I were close and she didn’t care about images in front of me. Pansy loved my mother for that. But right now, I just turned my head back her way and pursed my lips in chastisement and irritation.   “I would like to bring about attention to the fact that we are still human and so I have my rights to remain silent. I plead the fifth.” I blandly spoke out.   Mother rolled her eyes, a small smile gracing her face and I visibly relaxed at that small gesture. Sometimes she wouldn’t let herself smile. I knew I didn’t, but I couldn’t bare it if she did the same thing I did. Holding together so many emotions can make oneself feel too suffocated. I was in constant trepidation for it.   “If I start seeing you walking side to side every morning, then I can conclude you’ve got a lover you’re not telling your dear old mother about.”   My lips parted at my mothers exclamation. “Oh, please stop this endless torture! How in the world would you think of such a thing?!” I fumed, glaring at my her with no raging heat in them.   Narcissa knew I was gay. She was the one that found all my gay porn magazines hidden beneath my bed when I was younger and she never told father. Mother also knew I was a virgin since wizard families have this weird connection with one another and they would magically know when their relatives lost their virginity.   It was fucking creepy.   Mother shrugged, an impish grin crossing her features now. She was in the mood to converse, thank the gods, but often times she would draw in on herself and speak to no one for days. I’m relieved today wasn’t those times. “Honey, we both know how much I enjoy making you embarrassed-”   I raised my hands, blushing harder at my mother’s words and swinging them profusely in front of me as if warding off her statements. “Enough, enough! It’s already mortifying talking about such indecent stuff with my own mother.”   It’s not like I would let anyone close enough to actually do anything to me, so this talk is useless.   “Anyway, I’ve got to put my stuff away and help start dinner with the elves. Relax mother, I’ll be in company for this one week.” I gave her a shaky smile.   Mother didn’t further intone about my subject change but instead, gave me her own wobbly smile. “I’m sure Poppy would appreciate the help, as well as the others here. Go on, don’t strain yourself too much this week, it is vacation anyways.”   I nodded my assent to her. “As I will. I’ll see you at dinner. Now, if you excuse me.”   Mother closed her eyes in agreement and I turned on my heel to trail up our spiraling staircase and up to my room.   I already felt the heaviness weighing down on my shoulders once again because I knew in a few hours or so, mother would draw into herself and speak no words, unstable and trapped in a vegetable like state. I would lose her for hours on end whenever I was home, and I was sure I was going to again soon.   I made sure to put our previous conversion in my memories, just to remember something other than the only parent I had left losing her mind every single day.    

After settling down into the the house for a couple hours, I decided to change out of my stuffy school uniform and change into the clothes I regularly wore when in the solace of my own house.Pansy helped pick them out and they were cute and something I would never wear in the dorm rooms of Hogwarts. The girls school outfit only upped how much I liked wearing … much softer textures and dainty things. I thought that if I ignored the fact that I liked the feeling of wearing girls clothes, I wouldn’t fall deeper into that spectrum. I already wore delicate things but had never put myself into a skirt. My dumb ass brought the uniform back to my house so I could shove it in my closet filled with equally delicate fabrics. I stripped out of my clothes and slipped on cotton, cream colored shorts that met a little above mid thigh with a long sleeved pink sweater, loose and hanging off one shoulder, the sleeves passing over the tips of my fingers. I paired my outfit off with thigh high white socks, soft against the skin of my legs, and deemed myself ready to help the elves with cooking. Everyone from school had this notion that I hated the servants in my house, but they were the ones who actually helped me go through puberty, calmed me down when I cried as a child and let me roam around the house and gardens when I was bored. When mother was too busy to notice I existed in her life at times, they were there despite having to be paid to deal with me. I learned they genuinely about how much they cared for me and have grown to care for them as well. Jogging down the spiraling gold trimmed stairs to the the large kitchen after passing about four other extra living rooms with my sock clad feet, I came bursting through the shimmering kitchen floors, slipping the slightest bit to find three of our house elves working together in the room. Poppy, Kinian and Bronsky stared at me with mirth in their large eyes. Poppy immediately dropped the flour in her awaiting hands, hobbling towards to me with erratic huffs and shoving her face into my belly as she wrapped her arms around my middle. “Oh, Master Saveri has come home. Poppy missed you so. Mistress Narcissa said you decided to help.” Poppy mumbled into my shirt. I cracked a small smile and patted her unruly auburn hair. The others cooed from their positions next to the boiling vegetables and fancied meats, calling out my name and smiling brightly. My chest ached at the sight of them, hating that I missed them almost everyday because they were like my family and I was so close to them, as much as I was to Pansy. “Yep, I’m here to help. What do you want me to do?” I grinned. Kinian gave me a toothy smile, pointing the sharp end of his knife towards the cabinets. “Saveri starts with silverware and sets the table up.” I nodded, already staring towards the porcelain set in the other cabinets and setting to work after hugging each one of the elves. Bronsky, after a couple minutes, had taken me back into the kitchen where he had me cut up some more greens. While I started chopping away, Kinian made a snuffling sound and spoke up from beside me. “Master Saveri, you smell of werewolf.” I stopped all motion, twisting my head towards the elf with a furrow to my brow, nerves ticking inside the hollow of my bones as heat threatened to crawl up my neck. I kept my face pinched into a look of calm. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Kinian.” Poppy came bumbling from her perch on a stool to reach the kitchen sink, already settling herself in front of my person, looking up with a frown and a curious worry shimmering in her green eyes. “We creatures can smell marks on others. Saveri gives off arousal and fear when mentioning werewolf. There's a distinct scent of the creature all over Saveri.” Oh hell no. I shifted on one foot to the next, uncomfortable as a blush flooded my face without having any way to stop it. “It was a run in. I don’t know anything about the werewolf, it just touched me and left. I’m not interested in it.” I breathed. Bronsky snorted to my left, making me whip my head around and narrow my eyes at the elf. He raised amused brows as he pointed a spatula at my face. “You are a terrible liar, Master Saveri. We can smell your interest.” Pursing my lips, I twisted my head away from their large open gazes and swept my hand down, the one with the knife, and sliced through the slick of the tomatoes with a lot more aggressiveness than I would have liked to have shown. Stupid werewolf. Why the fuck would it mark me? I wasn't the damn thing’s property, hell, I haven't seen the creature since the first time meeting it. Of course the elves could pick up on whatever marking the werewolf gave me, they were good at those kinds of things. I wasn't mad at them for pointing it out, just embarrassed and worried. The elves that have taken care of me for as long as I could remember could smell when I was aroused and that was very invading on my person but it wasn't like they could help it. “I'm curious about not having died from meeting the werewolf. That's why you smell interest. Other than that. I haven't any need to want to meet the creature again.” I spoke through my teeth that jabbed against my bottom lip, rocking back and forth on my heels to keep myself from fidgeting beneath my house worker’s prying eyes. Bronsky huffed near me as I started to cut more of the tomato. “Did werewolf do something to Saveri? It seems like its scent has covered Masters groin and bottom area-” “I would like it very much if we stopped talking about this now.” I placed the knife back down across the surface of the table, taking in a deep breath to keep myself from snapping at the elves in frustration about the subject we were currently talking about. “I’m fine, I truly am. It’s nothing to worry about. Promise.” I turned to give Bronsky a small tilt of my lips, shy and somewhat strained. He was the one most worried about this whole thing between me and the creature it seemed. Bonsky’s large brows furrowed in concentration only for a moment before he turned his back to me and waved his hand in a gesture to wave off the conversation. “As Master Saveri wants, we stop this talk. Now, let’s get dinner done. Mistress Narcissa needs meds soon and she needs to eat before taking them.” Nodding along with the others, I let out a sigh of relief. I really don’t think the whole werewolf thing is a big deal. Nothing has happened to me since having run into the creature and I didn’t feel anything weird. I lifted the knife back up and cut through the tomato once again, but winced when the tip of the sharp steel nicked my other hand’s ring finger, blood spilling across the cutting board as I sucked on the split skin to take away the bleeding. I sucked at wielding knives. My eyes caught sight of Kinian, who was closest to me, watching me openly. His gaze large and wary, nose wiggling about and reminding me of a bunny. I gave him a shrug and a crooked grin before washing my hands and beginning work again. The elves were silent for the rest of the night and I had a feeling that their minds were on the werewolf and it’s so called “mark” on me. I think they needed vacation just like Rhayden’s elves. They were worrying over nothing.   The next day, after having slept in for once in a long time, I accidentally missed breakfast and opted to eat chocolate because I’m healthy as fuck and had taken a shower right after. I gathered some things up for the hours that I’d be cleaning, having brought my IPod, headphones, some cleaning utensils I snuck from the elve’s cabinets and extra clothes if I got too hot working. Gripping the floo powder, I spoke out loud the address to Rhayden’s mansion and tossed it into the fire place, the green flames glowing and rising high up to the height of my figure so I could easily step through the magic induced portal. Always going through the floo transportation left me slightly dizzy. I swayed to and fro on my feet, trying to heave in enough air as much as I could so I could get oxygen building back up in my brain from such an odd sensation of push and pull on every side of my body and innards. It always felt like I was being twisted up inside and out. I stood in front of a large black gate, iron wrought and tall, covering the absurdly large mansion set before me. It was … breathtaking. Xeyrus mansion was nowhere near the likes of a mansion, but a fucking castle, a foreboding yet magnetizing one. The large place took up more acres than I could count, covered by trees in full bloom with their emerald greens shimmering beneath the hazed clouds above my head. The castle had an old gothic look about itself, intricate designs dating back to hundreds of years ago with its slick black structure, looming high and seeming to stretch towards the wispy sky. The castle was endless in its elegance and allure, a darkness it carried with its cathedral like formation. Beautiful. My mouth opened in an exaltation of awe at the sight before me. Taking in the gravel road that lead down quite a distance to the front entrance of the castle, I caught sight of the black convertible park to the side behind the gate that I stood in front of. Blinking profusely, I had licked my lips in a nervous gesture to grip my bag tight in the grasp of my hand and walked over to the small device embedded into the gates structure, furrowing my brows as I kept glancing back from the screen and its punctual numbered devices to the castle itself. Lifting the tip of my index finger to press the biggest button and assuming that it was the one I needed to allow me to speak through the the tiny microphone on the device, I let out a tiny cough. “Saveri.” I breathed, noticing how my voice shook in the way that I haven’t spoke of my real name to anyone other than my own family. This was new. This was … letting a tiny piece of myself, real and raw, out in the open even though no one was around me and it left me breathless by every passing second I waited for the gate to open. How the hell did Rhayden know about my name anyway? What more does he know? My body jerked when I heard the creak of the gates coming to life as it opened from within the middle of its formation , separating from each other to move inwards and reminding me of some butler sweeping his arms out to entice a guest to “please enter”. It made me nervous. Scurrying my way through the opened gates, I immediately got into the convertible. I only knew how to drive muggle cars because Pansy and I were curious little shits when we were younger, went to the muggle world and had stolen a car. We learned quickly how to use it when we were being chased by the police. We now often went out to the Muggle world after Voldemort died and had driven more cars than I could count on one hand. Mother didn’t need to know of our late night escapes. Letting a giddy grin spread out over my features, all the anxiety sort of left me when I threw my bag on the passenger side seat and revved up the car's engine all the while gripping the wheel. Thank god I knew how to drive these machines. The muggle world had some awesome technology, I’ll give them that. And they had some decent fashion sense. My heart raced as I drove down the graveled path, taking in the way the trees curved over the hood of the car, leaves and sticks brushing the hood. The sound of the wheels rolling over the rocks had caused a shiver to race over my flesh, the ground crumpling and collapsing beneath the weight of the car. I loved the sound. After a good five minutes of driving down the rocky road, I parked the car in front of the beginnings of the cement steps that lead up to the large entrance doors, letting out a sigh as I turned off the engine and picked my stuff up again to come traipsing out of the car and up the stairs. I bet that Rhayden and his pronounce talent in herbology caused the nature surrounding this castle to be at its tip top shape, forever in a state of freshly new and young. As I followed the steps and looked at the array of morning glory flowers covering the ground from each of my sides, everything so big, I felt a dread fall over me. How was I going to clean this ginormous castle!? I mean, I helped clean the house with my elves at Malfoy Manor but Rhayden wasn’t going to have his elves helping me because they were sent out on vacation! I was going to have to clean that monstrosity of a so called “mansion”!? With widened eyes filled with unadulterated horror at the sheer audacity of my upcoming work schedule, I held back the urge to whimper in dismay. I’ll end up too tired to leave the place when I get some work done on it today. I can guarantee it. And was I going to see Rhayden or was I just expected to come on in and start cleaning? With a dejected sigh, I knocked on the polished black lacquered wooden doors, feeling a jitter in my restless legs as I tried to keep calm. With a few good minutes of me silently waiting outside of the door, I lifted my hand to knock again, making sure that I was going to be louder and perhaps make it obnoxiously so in a childish attempt to get on Rhayden’s nerves. He deserves my ruckus because he was making me do all this crap . Before I could even lift my hand and follow through with my plan, the right door had swung open inwards and I was facing Rhayden, gobsmacked at having to tilt my head back so I could look directly into his eyes but delayed that action for a bit when I ran my gaze up the length of his form. Rhayden wore a suit colored in charcoal tones that hugged his lean figure and shown the long length of his arms and legs, muscles bunching up beneath the slick fabric. He wore a smoky tie that matched his black vest and neat white buttoned up shirt beneath it. Looking like the charming devil itself. He was so tall and dark with all his fitness displayed in that suite. Slacks showing off how toned his thighs and calves were in accompaniment with black patent pointed leather shoes. A set of silver weaving patterned designed rings were on his left index and middle fingers. A heatwave fell over my stomach, breath catching at the sight of his long fingers, the smooth skin coveted by rings. Strong and capable. The silver complimented his hands and made my mind fall into a pit of inappropriate thoughts. Like the way the rings could leave harsh welts across the expanse of my skin, across the backs of my thighs and ass. I felt a blush cover my face at the audacity of my train of thought and had to wrench my gaze away from Rhayden’s hands and up his broad chest to his face to stop myself from imagining any more things that I shouldn't be thinking of. It didn’t help keep away the heat I felt. His hair was pushed back, dark strands enticing in their brown tufts as some stray strands fell from the enticing slick of his hair and framed his sharp features, eyes the same color as the brilliant black marbled floors of his foyer, hints of amber mingling with the hematite black tones. Rich and gleaming. Those lips of his were set into a straight line and the sight of them had my back straightening up, noticing that Rhayden wasn’t talking and I was staring. Whipping my eyes to meet his, I felt the need to take a step back because his presence in that dark suit made him look even more intimidating. It was overwhelming. “Are you done checking me out now? Do I have your attention?” Rhayden’s voice husked. Fuck him for being handsome and distracting me. Bastard. And he had my attention since the beginning of the school year, despite my not wanting it too. It didn’t mean I was infatuated with the fool, no, it was just … a curiosity focused solely on Rhayden. Nothing more, nothing less. Pursing my lips in irritation, I watched him from beneath my lashes. “I wasn’t checking you out, don’t flatter yourself. Anyway, I’m here. Ready to clean this castle that’s the size of a town itself.” I let my words drip with sarcasm. Rhayden silently watched me, shoving his hands into his pockets and covering the sight of his rings. I was sort of disappointed at that. Fuck, I needed to get my shit together. “You can clean this place in a week if you don’t mess around. Stop complaining, Blondie. It’s not my fault you’re a spoiled brat who probably had his elves clean for him his entire life.” Rhayden replied. I glared up at him, heart racing just being near him and trying to ease away the warmth and anxiety that he created within my body. “You don’t know shit about me, Rhayden. ” I gave myself a pat on my back for not having stuttered once in front of him. If I kept up my bitchy attitude, I’ll be fine. It’s when I let my guard down I ended up stuttering. My walls were up now, although shaky in its foundations being in the same proximity as Rhayden. Rhayden raised his dark brows at me, eyes infinite in their emotionless state. It was like I was being sucked in through that gaze of his. “You seem to forget that you got into my property by saying your real name, Saveri. I do know a few things about you.” The sound of Rhayden saying my real name had my knees buckle instantaneously. I staggered on the spot, the way his deep voiced dipped like fine chocolate as he intoned my name out loud, causing my heart to practically stutter in its confines beneath my chest and having a stunning impact on my body. I tried to gather my bearings, shoving my teeth into my bottom lip as I grew agitated at my reaction. I needed to focus and not let Rhayden get to me. I needed to do my bidding and get the hell out of here. “So are you just going to leave and have me wonder around aimlessly and clean what I see? Or do I get a list and instructions for what to clean?” I asked, breathless and trying to draw the conversation elsewhere. Rhayden nudged his head towards his foyer, a silent command for me to step in through the castle. Walking in past his person, I caught wind of his regular scent, intoxicating as usual, but this time with a hint of cologne that made me want to claw my eyes out to stop myself from ram sacking onto the damn man. I highly doubt I could knock him over.   I curled my fingers into my palms, creating straining fists to keep from doing anything rash.    I don’t want him.       He’s scary. He’s arrogant.       He’s got secrets. Secrets that may or may not cause me more stress than I already had.  Looking up at the high ceiling with its chandelier and two sets of staircases set up in a spiraling display that led up to the second level, I pressed my lips together to keep them from opening in awe at the view of the place. I heard the door shut behind me and tensed, knowing now that it was only me and Rhayden in this huge place. “I’ll have to leave in a couple minutes, so you’ll need to remember what I’m telling you.” Rhayden said, directly behind me. I turned on my heel, taking in a sharp breath at how damn close he was. Did this man know what personal space meant?! “Alright.” I replied. Rhayden looked around himself, ignoring my person as he spoke lowly. “You are to dust, sweep, mop and polish the rooms you enter. You do as much as you can within the seven hours you are inclined to be here. You can take breaks, but only one because I know you’ll use it to your advantage if I gave you more than one. You are not, in any circumstances, allowed to enter the South wing. My room is off limits, which is in the West wing. It is the only room in that direction.” He was saying all of this so fast and it was making my head spin. Rhayden’s few last sentences had me furrowing my brows though, a smirk splitting my features. “What is this? A scene from Beauty and the Beast?  Where I’m not allowed to go into the West wing?” I mocked him. Rhayden stared back at me without any show of amusement in my teasing. “I didn’t know you watched childrens movies often.” Going red at his declaration, I snapped at him in a fluster. “I-I don’t! Pansy made me watch them when we were little.” I explained with false facts. I liked watching Disney movies whenever I was way down in the dumps. They made me happy and had me feel like that ten year old child again that loved watching Disney films all by myself. Pansy wasn’t into the muggle animations. But Rhayden didn’t have to know that. Rhayden stared down at me to the point that I shifted again once on my feet in nervousness. “Right.  Kitchen is in the East Wing on the ground level. I’ll know if you don’t do anything and don’t ask me how, it’s bothersome to explain the magic used to know these things to someone who sucks at casting them.” I gaped up at him. “Hey! You liar. You know damn well I’m good at magic. So shut up.” I seethed. Rhayden rolled his eyes, the gesture new and making my brain halt in its function for that one moment from seeing such an open action from this well put together man. “Just know that I will be informed if you aren’t cleaning. Remember what I said about the wings and my room. I’ll be back exactly at midnight.” I pursed my lips, curiosity getting the better of me. “Why do you have to be gone for that long? What are you doing? And why do you go by the name Neville in Hogwarts? Longbottom isn’t even your surname. What are you, exactly? Royalty? I’ve never heard of a Xeryus line of royals. And how did you know that my real name was Saveri? What-” “You’re here to do me a favor because I did you one. Don’t start running off that mouth of yours like you have the right to. Do as I asked of you and keep your nose out of my business.” Rhayden interrupted my stream of questions, harsh and laced with heated words. It took me by surprise, making my eyes widen and my lips part. Jesus, he gets mad so fucking quickly. Calm one second, snapping the next. Like a fucking animal. Like that werewolf … And Rhayden’s eyes were that same color to that creature. So similar to one another. I averted my eyes from his, feeling a tremor in my limbs as I took a step back from him. A sudden cautiousness took solace in my body movements because Rhayden sounded just like he did that night he caught me in that Gryffindor uniform, hot and heavy and terrifying. “So I’m going to be left alone for seven hours in this huge place? Fine. That’s alright. Leave already.” I softly replied, irritated at how scared I was now of this man before me and how I’ve been feeling my blood boil beneath my flesh at the closeness of Rhayden, my cock alive and twitching all the time around him despite how much in fear I was of this man. “I’m sure you have your ways to entertain yourself and cleaning will keep you occupied.” Rhayden murmured, going back into that toneless drawl of his. I kept my gaze trained on the floor, gritting my teeth together as I watched Rhayden’s feet shift and raised my eyes then to watch him walk away and out the door. The soft suction sound of apparition cracked from outside and I just knew Rhayden was gone now. Why was it that I was left constantly having to watch Rhayden walk away from me? I fucking hated him. He made me feel so inferior and weak. I gripped my bag harder and set off to start this tedious work, grumbling beneath my breath the whole way.   A soft hum passed my lips, trailing the duster in my hand across the dark brown walls of the hallway I trudged down, trying to create that same melodic tune mother used to sing to me in an effort to get me to sleep when I was little, keeping myself occupied. I was almost on my way to water the plants in the hothouse. I would think that Rhayden would want to have that done because he was such a plant freak and I was a good person for making sure his precious greens were healthy. My arms and knees were sore from having crawled on the floor to reach places on the ground and furniture so I could rub them down and make sure they were gleaming by the time I was finished. I decided dusting was good for now to keep myself from getting aching limbs before even starting the rest of the rooms for the rest of the week. I was nearing the South wing’s entrance and I was slowing my steps with each lift of my feet nearing the place. Rhayden told me not to go there. Dropping the duster to the pristine floor, I rolled up my sleeves to my elbows, blowing out a breath as I felt sweat bead at the back of my neck and bottom of my spine, sticking to my clothes uncomfortably as I stared down the dark hallway and tried to stop so much noise from wheezing past my mouth. I cleaned for four hours and I was tired already. I needed to exercise more. And I needed to distract myself from getting the urge to enter the South wing. The only thing stopping me from doing so was remembering the way Rhayden had warned me, demanding and filled with underlying threat. But all thoughts were broken apart when I heard something. A guttural groan. What was that? It was made up of feral bliss, low and drawn out, echoing through the wide space of the hallway and bouncing off the walls in a resounding ricochet. It was faint, so soft that I would have thought my mind had made it up if not for the way the sound seemed to reverberate around the air surrounding me. The silence of the castle made it damn near impossible to not miss that indefinite thrilled cadence. I felt all the muscles in my body freeze up on the spot, breath halting in my lungs as I strained my ears in a hope to hear that groan again. It came from the South Wing’s entrance. I couldn’t help the way my pulse ratcheted up into a quick stream of thumps, feeling my veins throb as blood rushed quickly throughout my arms and legs, a sort of paranoid panic flooding my system and rendering me motionless and attentive. I lurched back when a smell reached my senses, throat closing in on itself and opening multiple times as bile started to gather at the center of my chest and rush up my throat. The scent of metallic, rustic blood, raw and open, bombarded into me. The smell was pungent, suffocating in its acrid smell. My mouth sealed on itself, throat working to keep from throwing up on the spot and maybe, perhaps, causing something to happen to me. What would happen if I made a loud sound? What was this smell? Who groaned just then? What the fuck was Rhayden keeping in the South wing? I shook on the spot, taking in a large gulp of air as I snapped my body down to snatch up my duster and make my steps as light as possible as I ran down the hallway, opposite from where that smell and sound had come from. What did I get myself into? With quickened steps, I made sure to race back downstairs since I was on the second level and plopped my ass down at the bottom set of stairs. Maybe it is just my imagination. Maybe instead of going into a numbed state like my mother, I was actually losing my goddamn mind in my slip of sanity. Hearing and seeing things I shouldn’t. Was father being sentenced to Azkaban and dying there along with living with Voldemort for a good amount of my life finally catching up to me and making me go crazy? Should I go back up there and enter the South tower just to show myself that everything that just happened was out of the result of losing my mind? I was deteriorating like my mother. Hell, this morning, I completely forgot to have a proper breakfast and instead ate chocolate. Was that me being foolish or going insane. Fuck, I sound ridiculous. But that smell and sound felt and seemed so real. Taking in heaving breaths as I shoved my fingers through the mess of my hair, I tugged at them in time with the hard beatings of my heart, trying to elicit pain so I could focus on that one feeling and know that this moment was real, that I am real. It was an effort to get bearings on my surroundings, telling myself that whatever I just witnessed probably was a slip in my imagination because this place was so quiet and huge that one would start to think shit up out of pure boredom. I needed to ground myself. Forming my lips into an “O”, I let that same tune my mother sang to me when I was little, emit from my mouth and filter through the space of the foyer to surround my figure, a comforting gesture to myself. I was going to be alright. I had to be. Mother needed me to be alright. Taking a few breaths, I stood up on shaking legs, trying to ease the nerves that simmered irritatingly beneath my skin. I chose to ignore what maybe my mind had conjured up and instead decided to go the kitchen and get something to eat and gain enough energy to start my cleaning of the kitchen floors and its shelves next. There was a cold sweat at the base of my spine though whenever I thought about having to go back onto the second level.  I was going to be okay.       I was going to be alright.    After eating a bologna sandwich and drinking as much water as I could, I made myself get back to work, finally feeling the unnerving quake in my body lessen. When it was eleven thirty and I found that I had cleaned about nine rooms only on the ground level of the castle, I had draped my body over one out of many lounge chairs Rhayden’s massive castle had. He had black furniture to match the outside of the entirety of his mansion, dark and luxurious. I have never been so happy to lay on a simple piece of furniture before. I should have taken a break closer when night fell because even though I had already taken a break, I feared that Rhayden wouldn’t like that I was resting again when he specifically told me that I wasn’t allowed another one. He was almost going to be back so I didn’t think this was bad. Just resting for the tiniest bit wouldn’t hurt anything or anyone. When I felt my eyelids drooping over my vision, dark spots flecking about in my slowly blackening gaze as a drowsiness fell over my prone figure, I mentally cursed myself when I couldn’t help but fall into the darkness’s grasps. Fuck. Rhayden is going to be mad. But I was tired and today took a lot more out of me than I ever thought possible, especially after my somewhat mental breakdown. Next thing I knew, everything went completely blank and my surroundings faded away from me.   I felt my body shift, a weightlessness about itself as I floated in a mindless daze, Something hot gripping my waist as the surface I had laid upon disappeared from beneath my body and warm air coveted the whole of my skin. My head lolled to the side, mouth parting to suck in the warmed atmosphere and lovely scent of mint and burnt forests. I could make out how my limbs were being situated from here and there, feeling those searing grasps grabbing at my thighs to spread them apart and a hardness pressing between them, lined up with my own lax body. I was lost in the sensation of the heat and comforting firmness, my arms being brought up and wrapping around something equally hot. I sighed out in contentment, mumbling incoherently beneath my breath as I pressed the tip of my nose into the space of the heat where the scent was at its strongest, inhaling and curling myself over and into whatever that was holding me now. I felt the swell of my arse cheeks suddenly being gripped into a tight enough hold that it had made my mouth open wider and caused the plush of my bottom lip to rub against the heated flesh I was forced onto. My mouth let out puffs of air with the way I was tugged into the heated figure with the grips on my ass pulling me forward every other second. My legs parted even more, dangling about as I felt myself being carried. I was being carried. Huh? The haze in my mind descended, parting from my sleep addled state to elicit my brain to start working in regular time, slowly but surely, as I let my eyelids peel open in a too relaxed manner. I blinked at the sight of skin attached to a neck, lips practically pressing firmly against the flesh I was staring at now, head turned into the curve of the shoulder it rested on and my fingers twitching from where they were wrapped behind both sides of said neck. My arms curled around it. Oh fuck. Snapping my head up, my face had turned down to stare at golden hued eyes staring straight at me. Rhayden. “I-I … uhm .... huh?” I was so coherent when I woke up. Tilting my body, my back arched, unconsciously pressing my chest more against Rhayden’s as I looked down in distraction to see his hands filled with my ass and the backs of my thighs, holding me close to his figure. I was being carried by Rhayden. I fell asleep. On Rhayden’s couch. Oh, fuck me. Body lighting up with sudden fire, I started to squirm in Rhayden’s arms, lifting my hands up so I could place them on the harsh planes of his still suited up chest and laid them flat across his torso to weakly push at it, arms still trying to get enough blood flowing through them to move. “Fuck, I didn’t mean to sleep. You can put me down, I can walk perfectly fine.” I rasped out, cringing at the way my voice was slightly higher than usual and cracking with the remnants of my sleep induced vocal chords just having woken up. I made sure to not look at Rhayden as I struggled about in his death grip. He wouldn’t fucking move! Growing hot at the cheeks and feeling my lower half start waking up more and more, I grew frustrated and nervous. “I s-said put me down, Rhayden! Fuck. I can walk by myself.” I hissed out through clenched teeth. A low growl, rumbling in the depth of Rhayden’s chest, sounded and vibrated against my own. It was downright predatory. A warning clear and evident in its thunderous roiling tone. My cock throbbed at the sound as goosebumps ran over my wakening skin. Gazing down at Rhayden’s bowed head, so very close to the long line of my throat as his breath ghosted over the tender skin there, a furnace of air came from his mouth. I stilled in his arms, feeling like a ensnared prisoner. “Stop fucking squirming. I’m bringing you home and I don’t need you to make a sound.” It was as if Rhayden’s voice didn’t belong to him. Someone’s voice, someone who was not at all familiar to my senses, spoke out from behind me, far back and distant. “I knew I smelled something particularly … sweet.” The voice had my back going rigid, raspy and low in a way that reminded me of someone who has smoked way too much in their lifetime. My breath stalled in my throat as I looked down at Rhayden and the way his eyes were trained on the person who just talked right behind me. I tried to twist my body around to see who was talking but jerked in Rhayden’s suddenly painfully tight grip on my thighs, tugging me back into him and making my neck smother against the silky smooth locks of his hair. He could most likely feel the racing beat of my heart against my chest in response to being pressed against him and the pure animosity in the air. Rhayden didn’t pay me any attention when I felt him take a few steps back, his shoulders stiff as stone as those eerily magnetizing eyes of his tracked whatever or whoever was behind me, that same infuriating mask of boredom splattered over his handsome features. But I could see the smallest tick in his jaw, as if he was coiled tight and was trying to keep himself at bay. “You were ordered to stay away until I come to you.” Rhayden’s voice went positively hostile, rolling in time with an impact of dark intonation, gaze fixated behind me. I didn’t dare move, my eyes stuck on the way Rhayden’s gaze seemed to glow. I feared moving. And it seemed Rhayden thought that me not doing anything was the best. I could easily pick up on any hints of danger, and right now, the air was stifling in its menacing surroundings. I stayed in his arms, lungs stilted in their functioning. My eyes were wide, completely awake now as I flicked my tongue over my lips in an anxious habit of mine. The same voice responded to Rhayden’s words. “This is not what an heir’s number one priority should be.”  What the fuck are they talking about?  “Are you questioning my authority.” Rhayden spoke briskly, monotonous and sounding out in a threatening murmur. It wasn’t a question, but a statement. What’s going on? I could hear the man shuffle behind me, feet shiting as he cleared his throat, the sound showing the sudden discomfort he felt. Sadly, I couldn’t make out Rhayden’s eyes because I was being forced onto his body more and more with every step backwards he took, his grip absurdly bruising on my skin. “O-of course not. It’s just that everyone is hungry and we are-” “This will only take a second. Wait until then.” Rhayden demanded, interrupting the man’s nerved sentence. “What-” I squeaked out when that familiar feeling of my body and essence being torn apart and put back together over and over again had my stomach lurching and my arms coming back up in a blurring motion to grip onto Rhayden’s back muscles, digging my fingernails into his shoulders as I gasped out in pain and shock. We were apparating. When I felt my head stop spinning and heard Rhayden’s feet softly touch ground, I blinked dazedly to see that we were in my room. How the hell did Rhayden just do that!? Looking down at him with widened eyes, I bit down on my lip. “You didn’t use your wand. Just like Potter does. How the hell did you do that? And ..." My words faded when I saw the way Rhayden’s eyes were actually shifting back and forth to gleaming in the darkness of my room to its somewhat normal mixture of gold and obsidian. They were practically lit up one second then back to its normal state the next. Before I could ask what the hell was going on with him, I was shifted absurdly fast, inhumanely so, that everything was a wash of colors in front of my eyes when I was unceremoniously dumped onto my bed, bouncing and lying flat on my back across the soft mattress. Rhayden stared down at me, looming and watching me with those fucking eyes of his. My breath was stunted. And silence, heavy with air and heat, fell between us as we watched each other. Rhayden looked … feral. Just like that werewolf. I had started to shift onto my elbows, only to stop when Rhayden narrowed his eyes, fixated on my figure and speaking sharply. “You need to stop moving. Now.” I made every muscle in my body stop. Completely following this man’s orders without any further protest, as if I had no other way to stop myself from doing so. “Rhayden, what-” “Remember our deal. You keep your nose out of things and finish the favor. Don’t keep asking me questions.” Leaving me with no time to respond, Rhayden once again apparated and left me on my bed, shocked, horny and confused as all hell. That motherfucker always had to be the one to have the last word. Turning on my stomach in sheer agitation, I grabbed my pillow to shove my face into it and scream against the plush surface, sinking my teeth down into the material and biting down over the fabric to keep any sounds muffled to not wake my mother. I wanted to know what the fuck that was all about?  I wanted to know why I couldn’t go into the South wing, if what I heard was my mind playing tricks on me or if something was really happening there. Who was that person in Rhayden’s castle? Next time I needed to suck up my cowardice and look at whatever it was that elicited such a reaction from Rhayden, regardless if the atmosphere I felt during that moment was considerably frightening and in need of no interruption on my end. I couldn't and will not give Rhayden my trust so carelessly. Why was I even doing everything Rhayden was telling me to!? He doesn’t own me, that bastard. It was as if the only thought running through my head during Rhayden's exchange with that weird man was that he could keep me safe. I promised myself to never let anyone have that much of my trust. Hell, I barely knew Rhayden, who went by a fake name all this time.  Just like how you kept your real name from everyone.  I let out a little puff of air in annoyance at myself. So what if Rhayden and I were similar in wanting to keep some things to ourselves. He probably has more secrets than I did. He still was a complete mystery to me. I wanted to know why Neville was actually Rhayden. Why he reminded me so much of that werewolf and sometimes acted like such a threatening animal, especially with how he acted tonight. Pure dominance and overwhelming aggression. He seemed ready to attack.  And what was that whole thing about an heir?  My curiosity was getting the best of me and I just knew I was going to go into the South wing and do some snooping around, whether Rhayden likes it or not, and find out what the fuck is going on with him.  I wasn’t interested. I was just curious.       Yeah.       That’s it.  My heart raced as I yelled more into my pillow, body burnt up from the inside out, furious at how easily I gave into Rhayden’s orders and how I felt the need to know more about him. I needed to stop doing that. But I also needed answers out of my pure curiosity. It was winning over my every conscious protest in getting to know more about Rhayden. A curious Slytherin is the worst. It was inevitable in the way I couldn't help my own damn nosiness. I dreaded what I would find but exhilarated in it just as much.
