Molly set her basket of laundry onto the couch and sighed. September was always a hard month for her. Despite the reduction in chores and upkeep after several children, her heart still ached at the silence that greeted her each day while Arthur was away. While she did not miss their bickering, the noise of many feet stamping through the house had been a constant company for many years now. With Ginny off to Hogwarts, Molly was truly alone for the first time in years. She gazed to the large grandfather clock at the edge of the cluttered living room, the nine hands on it not pointing to a time but to many locations. Currently five of the hands pointed to school, three pointed towards work, and one, her own hand on the clock, pointed towards home. Peace settled over Molly as she accepted that though none of her family was home with her, they were at least all safe where they were.Pulling the clothes out of the basket she began to fold the clothes gently. While magic was an easier alternative, Molly enjoyed the handy work when there weren’t so many people to keep up with day to day. Now that it was only her and Arthur at home the chores seemed to take much less time and she had more of her day free to catch up on personal projects. Once the laundry was folded, she took it upstairs to put away, stopping to look around her room. So many memories were made in this home. They had moved in shortly after their wedding, adding bit by bit to their house as their family grew. Though money was tight most of the time and there were many mouths to feed, Molly never doubted her choice to marry Arthur despite even the disownment of her parents when she refused a proposal from a pureblood family who was in good standing with the Sacred Twenty-Eight. As if Molly could ever have chosen to marry simply for money. No, she would gladly take on the title of blood traitor any day before having accepted the proposal from the Macnair family.A noise from outside pulled Molly’s attention from her musing and towards the window. Nothing looked out of the ordinary, but she could have sworn she heard laughter from down in the yard. Taking the basket with her she made her way down the twisting staircase, wand in hand, into her living room once more. Still, she could see nothing out of the windows that concerned her so setting her wand down, she turned towards the laundry room to put the basket away. She understood her mistake right away. Standing in the doorway to her laundry stood a man she had not seen since her last year of Hogwarts.“Hello, Molly. I haven’t heard from you in some time. How are you doing?” Walden’s greasy voice sounded nearly the same as it had back in 1968. Panic pushed Molly backwards towards her wand but before she could grasp her fingers around the familiar wood a hand gripped her wrist harshly, dragging her hand away from it. Looking behind her, she met eyes with a man she only knew from pictures in the Daily Prophet but a face she could never forget.“Dolohov.” It was barely more than a whimper, a terrified utter of his name but Antonin Dolohov let out a humored laugh. He picked up her wand and pocketed it, pulling her along towards Macnair forcefully. Two more men entered her home, one she knew well enough between their time together at Hogwarts and her husband’s endless complaints of him: Lucius Malfoy. The other was one she only knew of from images in the papers as well: Rodolphus Lestrange. But both Rodolphus and Antonin had been imprisoned in Azkaban since the downfall of You-Know-Who back in 1981, how were they standing here in her living room today? And Dolohov, Dolohov why him of all people?“You know, it is quite the honor to meet the sister of the Prewett twins. Despite being enemies and the whole having to kill them aspect, they were decent adversaries. Hmm, I wonder, Walden, are you up for a game of chase with this one? You know we won’t let her go. C’mon, let’s have a little fun!” His body pressed up tightly against Molly’s, nails biting into her wrist sharply. Without her wand there was truly little she could do to disentangle herself from this situation. Dolohov’s game of cat and mouse seemed her best choice to get enough distance to disapparate to safety. Walden eyed them over carefully, looking between Lucius and Rodolphus for input.“C’mon, let us have a good chase. Azkaban was immensely depressing. She cannot get far, there is four of us. Just a little fun before you take her home.” The jeer in Rodolphus’ voice cause a shudder to run through Molly, but the understanding of his words hit much harder. ‘Take her home.’ There was no intention to kill her, nor to let her go. This would be her only chance. Lucius simply gave a noncommittal shrug indicating he did not care which course of events played out before him. Finally, a nod from Macnair and the hand around her wrist loosened. Beyond any of their notice, Molly’s hand on the family clock ticked from home to mortal peril. As quickly as Molly could move, she raced towards the kitchen hoping to make it outside the door and into the open yard. As long as she was in arms reach of any of these men, they could grab on to her and follow her anywhere she apparated. An awful realization halted Molly for a moment. My wand. Without her wand, she couldn’t apparate, she was horrid with more complex wandless magic. Lucius stepped out in front of her, cutting the escape short. She backed towards the sink, placing the kitchen table between her and the four men. There was no way out of the kitchen, both doors leading out had a post watching her every move as Dolohov and Rodolphus inched closer towards her.“Go ahead and have your fun but do see to it that you do not kill her, please. I have waited long enough for this day.” With Macnair’s blessing the two men swept forward. Molly grasped the closest object, a heavy frying pan, and threw it towards the oncoming men but Rodolphus merely cast it aside with a flick of his wand. Molly continued to throw anything she could reach at them but quickly the counter and sink behind her were empty. Pressing her back into the counter she looked around the room wildly for any escape, failing to notice Dolohov stepping towards the table. With a loud grunt he grasped one side of the table and upended it, throwing it towards Molly with a laugh. The heavy wood struck Molly’s front knocking the breath from her lungs and sending her to the floor gasping harshly for air. While Molly grasped for a hold on anything before her, Dolohov pulled his wand out.“Crucio!” Molly’s shriek of pain was guttural, having had no time to catch her breath before pain assaulted her. She could hear laughter but not one of the thoughts she had a moment ago was comprehensible to her any longer. Merlin, she just wanted this pain to end, and a moment later, blissfully, it did. They let her catch her breath for a minute before Dolohov moved forward and grasped her by the hair, dragging her to her feet. Letting go of her, she supported herself shakily on the overturned table to glare at the men before her.“Dolohov, step back. I have a spell I want to try, one Severus taught me years ago. Never got to use it before we went to Azkaban, and I have been so excited to see it for myself. Stand tall, blood traitor.” Despite his threats, Molly surged with pride at the insult from his tongue and erected herself as straight as she could in her weakened state. Rodolphus had been known for his utterly horrific enjoyment of torture during the wizarding war and Molly doubted his time in Azkaban had done anything for this except maybe given him time to come up with new methods. Gritting her teeth, she stared him down with an intensity she did not know she was capable of. “Sectumsempra!” This was a spell Molly had never heard of, but its effects were quickly known. A deep gash opened just below her left hip and tore up across her abdomen and torso, ending underneath her right collarbone. She dropped to the floor in a cry of anguish as blood seeped from her wound. Panting, she grasped at her stomach in an attempt to staunch the flow of blood welling up, but another pair pulled her hands away.“Damnit, Lestrange, what did I tell you! I wanted her alive! The hell are you doing testing a spell if you don’t know exactly what it does, now help me stop this bleeding.” Two more sets of hands begin pressing on her wound as a wand is pulled out and healing spells are uttered. The words slowly lost meaning to Molly as darkness tugged at the edges of her mind beckoning her towards it. Just before she fell into the bliss of unconsciousness, she felt a hand grip her wedding band and harshly tug it off her finger, dropping it onto the floor.Pain registered in Molly’s head as she slowly awoke. A blinding migraine assailed her, assisted by the sound of someone in the room with her. Slowly she opened her eyes only to close them tightly when she noticed exactly who was in the room with her. Narcissa Malfoy. How was she in a room with Narcissa Malfoy? As she lay there, slowly the pieces of fractured memory came back together again. Walden Macnair. Her assault at The Burrow. Her hand shot to her stomach, feeling for the gash that had torn her open but all she felt was a hard scar in its place. She traced it from its beginning on her upper thigh, across her hip and stomach, to her torso and over her breast, to where it faded under her right collarbone.“So, finally awake, are we? Macnair will be excited to hear about this. Open your eyes, blood traitor, and look at me.” Molly obliged and opened her eyes once more. The room was small, a double bed in one corner, a desk in the other. A lone window allowed light to enter the room. Narcissa sat on the bed beside her. “You have been unconscious for over a week now. Rodolphus really did a number on you, you were lucky to survive. He will be kept in better check in the future, that I can guarantee. You are fully healed; the injury should not bother you. Be grateful we have such a great healer in our midst. Welcome to Malfoy Manor, blood traitor. Soon you will be married to a proper Pureblood and have much more freedom. Up, come with me now to prepare for your union.” Molly laughed and pulled herself roughly into a seated position.“I am not marrying Walden Macnair. I am already married, contentedly, to my blood traitor husband. Nothing said or done is going to change that.” Narcissa’s lips pulled together.“Molly, what I am going to say, you never heard from me, you got that? Choice is never a matter in these circumstances. You are told what to do, and you do it. Not everyone here agrees with the cause, but we are here regardless. You are a woman in good standing when it comes to blood purity. You are a commodity and no more, a vehicle to bear an heir to a name and status. You might as well accept this life because there is no escaping it.” The hardness in her voice took Molly aback. Was Narcissa here under the same circumstances? But what kept her from leaving and finding a life somewhere else? That answer seemed simple enough. Here Narcissa had family, money, and station. If she left, what could she take with her? And what mother could leave her child in such a predicament? No, even if it meant aligning herself with the enemy, Narcissa chose to stay to protect Draco to the best of her ability. That much any mother could understand. Narcissa stood and offered her hand to Molly, helping her to her feet. Shaking from the effort, Molly followed Narcissa through cold hallways and into a small door off to the side of the corridor they were in. Inside was a vanity mirror, a padded seat, and hanging from the wall, a wedding robe. Tears filled Molly’s eyes as realization truly dawned on her. She was going to be married to Walden Macnair. Narcissa sat Molly in front of the vanity and started on her hair, but the newspaper on the table before her caught her eye. A picture of her and Arthur stared back at her above an article.  Wife of Ministry Official MissingSeptember 16thWife of ministry official Arthur Weasley(42, Head of Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office)Molly Weasley (42) was reported missing the eveningof Tuesday, September 15th. Arthur WeasleyReturned to his home after work on the 15thWhere he discovered the home in ruins.Auror John Dawlish gave a comment:“Furniture was overturned, things were broken.The kitchen was an absolute mess, when Auror’s arrived there was a large amountof blood on the kitchen floor. More than youthink someone could survive losing, but untilwe find a body, we will treat this as a missingpersons’ case.”Arthur Weasley begs anyone with informationabout the disappearance of his wife to come forward.“Please if you know anything let us know. We haveseven children who are all terrified for their mother. I just want her to be safe, but her hand on the clock is stuck on mortal peril… Ijust want her home safe.” Please let the Auror’s Office know if you hearanything about the location or condition ofMolly Weasley. Molly tore the article out gently, along with the picture of them above it and folded it into a small square. Tucking it securely into her bra, she looked up to the mirror once more.“Keep that hidden well. I don’t fancy Macnair may enjoy you looking at a picture of you and your husband when he believes he is your new one. But I won’t tell anyone about it.”“Thank you, Narcissa.” No more was said between the two of them as Narcissa finished her hair and makeup. Stepping out of the torn clothes she was in; Molly caught the first look of herself in the mirror. An angry scar lay where she had felt earlier, but Narcissa was correct, it had fully healed. Despite being puckered and tough compared to her normal skin, it was faded to a light pink that blended well enough with her soft white skin. Molly took a deep breath and turned from the mirror towards Narcissa who held her dress robes. Helping her to step into it, she pulled it together and buttoned it up the back.“You are ready. Let’s not keep him waiting, shall we?” Molly took a deep breath and followed Narcissa out of the small room. Her gaze trailed to her left hand where the indentation of the ring Arthur had given her so many years ago was fading. Symbolic, she supposed, as her future with Arthur was fading now too. Up ahead voices could be heard as Narcissa turned a corner. Turning the corner as well, Molly entered a room with a handful of people in it. Some she recognized from their wanted posters during the wizarding war. Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange, Antonin Dolohov, and Lucius Malfoy. The rest were unknown to her. Macnair stood at the front of the room in dress robes and as Molly entered the room he smiled, gesturing for the others to sit. Lucius stood behind Macnair who held his hand out to Molly. Molly stepped forward to stand beside Macnair as Lucius began speaking.“We have gathered here today as a witness to this Union between Molly Prewett and Walden Macnair. This union provides the opportunity for healthy Pureblood offspring, as well as a reward for Walden’s commitment to the Dark Lord over these last eleven years since his downfall. We thank you for your commitment and help during the Azkaban breach this summer, and here offer you your prize. Walden, do you take Molly Prewett to be yours and yours alone?” Molly’s head was reeling. This was not a wedding ceremony; this was nothing more than her being given away against her will. Narcissa had been correct, she would have no choices in the years to come. As Walden announced his acceptance of Molly, jeers arose behind them from the assembled death eaters. “Very well then, Walden, please mark your property.” Molly balked at Lucius’ words. Mark her? How did Macnair plan to mark her as his, here in front of everyone else? Macnair pulled his wand.“Flagrate.”  Midair before Molly two letters appeared in lines of flame. WM. With a flick of his wand the fiery letters moved towards Molly, burning through the wedding robes. Flames licked her skin and she cried out as the initials burned themselves into the skin just below her left collarbone. Macnair grabbed her roughly by her upper arm and pulled her forward into a kiss, muffling her cry of pain. Jeers and whooping laughter echoed around her as the gathered Death Eaters dispersed leaving Molly alone with Macnair. Taking her hand tightly he led her from the room, back through the twisting corridors she couldn’t keep up with, and to a set of ornate double doors. Opening them with another flick of his wand, he led Molly into a large room. In the middle stood a four-poster bed set with a deep green bedspread. To the right stood a large mahogany wardrobe and a door she assumed led to a bathroom ensuite. On the left side of the bed stood a writing desk and a bright window that looked over a garden roamed by peacocks. Figures, the cocky bastard would have peacocks strutting about his yard. She expected nothing less than this grandeur from Malfoy Manor. From the ceiling, lighting the room, hung an elegant crystal chandelier with candles flickering, sending dancing shards of light all about the room. Closing the door behind them, Macnair pulled Molly towards the bed gently. Disgust swept over Molly; she couldn’t be unfaithful to Arthur. Not even under these circumstances could she imagine doing that with another. Stoically she pulled her hand away from Macnair’s and took a step back, away from the bed.“Molly, come here.” Molly shook her head, panic beginning to take root in her chest. She refused to do this with him. “Molly, come here, now.” The last word was barely a hiss, indicating how serious he was but Molly adamantly refused, taking another step back. Macnair closed the space between them and grabbed onto Molly, who was shaking. “When I tell you to do something, it is not a choice. I am your master; do you understand me? You obey every order I give you. Now undress.” Still Molly refused, shaking her head and trying to pull away from him. Macnair let out a sigh. “I wanted our first time to be enjoyable to both of us, Molly. But you have decided otherwise. This will now be a punishment for you, and one I hope you can learn from. I don’t want to hurt you like this, but you leave me no other choice.” Molly looked up at him just in time to receive a stinging blow to her cheek. She attempted to place her hand over her cheek to protect from a second slap, but Macnair caught her hand and dragged her towards the bed. Throwing her down roughly, he laid over her, grabbing a hold of her hips in his hands. Molly struggled to pull out of his grasp, crying now as Macnair pressed his body closer to her.“Please, Walden, don’t! Please just let me go home and I won’t tell anyone about this, please! Let me go!” Her voice broke as shuddering sobs took over her frame. Macnair simply laughed.“You had twenty-four years, Molly. I am not waiting for you any longer, now stop struggling!” A second slap caught her off guard as a hand moved between her legs and started pushing them apart.“No! N-no! Stop!” Begging was no longer beneath her as she felt his hand press against her intimately. Arthur was the only person to have ever felt her this way and the idea of Macnair taking that away infuriated Molly. Taking a deep, shuddering breath she collected herself and shoved Macnair off her. Rolling off the side of the bed she nearly made it to the door before she heard–“Impedimenta!” Molly came crashing to the floor as her body refused to move. “Colloportus.” Above her, Molly could hear the doors lock. Hands wrapped around her roughly and picked her up, tossing her back onto the bed she had just escaped. Grabbing a hold of her dress robes at the collar he pulled, ripping the fabric open to the middle of her abdomen. Molly flinched as jewels and buttons scattered but the binding curse she was under prevented any further movement. Macnair continued ripping the robes until they fell open off her. Pulling her arms free of the entangling garment he tossed it to the side and turned his attention back towards Molly. “Now that I don’t have to fight you, this will be much easier,” he whispered into her neck before biting down. Molly cried out in pain, but it was muffled as her mouth remained closed. Macnair took his time, running his hands up and down her body, cataloging every scar and mark. His hand ghosted down the long one she had received the week before, frowning. “This was never meant to happen. I am sorry for that.” Moving on, he unlatched her bra and tossed it to the side. To Molly’s relief, the article and picture seemed to have stayed in the overlapping fabric she had tucked it into and remained with the bra when he pulled it away. To her dismay, however, this left her mostly bare before him.“Mhmm.” Molly tried to speak but her lips refused to cooperate. Macnair let out a chuckle and moved closer, one hand feeling one of Molly’s breasts, the other holding one in place as his mouth descended to cover it. A tear slid down Molly’s cheek. No matter what, at the end of this day, she was going to be ruined. After this Arthur could never want her back. He moved his mouth from the one breast to her other, licking and sucking on it as well. He pulled away after a few minutes, before moving further down her body. Molly’s breath hitched as his fingers tangled her underwear, pulling them off her entirely. No. No, please stop! No matter how much her mind begged for him to stop her mouth refused to work. All she could do was sob silently as his fingers pushed inside of her. She grimaced as they moved about inside of her, without any lubrication, and Molly was certainly not enjoying this enough to aid in that. A third finger was harshly added to Molly. She gasped at the painful stretch, Macnair began pulling his dressing robes away. Removing his fingers from Molly, he pulled the dress robes free and slid his underwear down his legs. Molly eyed him from the corner of her vision. Though Macnair was a bit shorter than Arthur, he was far thicker. Molly began to hyperventilate as Macnair stepped closer to her.“What was that stupid name Arthur used to call you back in our school days? Mollywobbles, wasn’t it?” Molly cringed at him using Arthur’s name for her, but the panic was still running its course. “Well, Mollywobbles, now is our time.” He grabbed Molly’s head and pulled her mouth open, pushing himself into her. Choking for air, she gagged as he pressed further towards the back of her mouth. Laughter rang out above her. “Would’ve figured you could handle that,” Macnair chuckled, pulling out a little. Molly gasped for air as tears blurred her vision. Never in her life had she thought this would occur to her. Macnair pushed back into her throat, starting a rhythm that left Molly fighting for air. As black began to seep into her vision, her lungs burning, Macnair finally pulled away from her. Molly gulped in the air as fast as she could with her mouth shut and closed her eyes, begging for an end to this. Arthur, I know you can’t hear me. I know you have no idea where I am, but please. Please come save me from him. Molly’s eyes snapped back open as Macnair’s hands grasped her knees and pushed them apart. Arthur, please! Please stop him! She knew it was ridiculous for her to ask any such thing of Arthur. He was incapable of saving her, but never before had he failed to make her feel safe, to protect her, so she clung to the idea of him now. Macnair settled himself between her legs. Molly could feel him pressing against her inner thigh, hard and still wet from her spit, and panic overtook her completely. While her body refused to respond her breathing became erratic, tears blinding her to seeing, sobs wracking her body.“Now, now, Mollywobbles. Everything is going to be okay, my dear.” With that, Macnair pushed into Molly. Even unable to open her mouth, the scream that came from Molly was ineffable. Macnair stalled for a moment, looking down at her. Tears had swollen her eyes, her faced contorted in unbearable pain. Her entire body was shaking, even beyond the effect of the curse he had used to immobilize her. “I told you, this time is going to be a punishment for your actions. You brought this pain on yourself, Molly. It doesn’t have to be like this in the future.” With that, Macnair continued his pace inside of Molly. Arthur. Please. Even now her weak grip on the hope of Arthur saving her was dissolving with each passing second, with every thrust inside of her. His pace continued to gain speed, Molly grunting with each push as the stinging between her legs grew hotter. Finally, Macnair shuddered to a stop, pushing himself as tightly against Molly as their bodies allowed. Gasping for breath, Macnair rolled off Molly and laid beside her, already falling into a deep sleep. Molly lay there for hours before sleep would overcome her, thoughts chasing each other around her head. How long would she suffer this? Would this truly be the end of her life, destined to lay under Macnair every night bearing him children, until he ultimately killed her? She hoped not, but tonight she had learned hope had no place within these walls.

Molly woke as Macnair rolled out of bed beside her. Her muscles still ached from last night as Molly pulled herself from the blankets and moved towards the bathroom. Brushing her teeth, she turned the bathtub on to start heating up while she rinsed her mouth. Stripping her clothes, her eyes caught the reflection in the mirror. Bruises of all shades littered her body, bite marks and scratches in various stages of healing. Tears pooled in her eyes as she looked at the initials burnt into her flesh, though healed they had scarred badly. She turned away from the mirror and stepped into the steaming tub. Drawing her hands around her knees, she pulled them to her chest and cried. A month had gone by since her imprisonment here but already it seemed longer. The only two that would speak to her, aside from Macnair every night as he told her to lay for him in the bed, was Narcissa, and Macnair’s house elf.Narcissa had spoken to her on occasion, giving her advice on ways to best stay out of sight and therefore receive less punishments. Always the words would have a sharp edge, but the look of concern in her eyes undercut any harshness they were spoken with. And Looney. The house elf was a sweet young thing. Well, relatively young, compared to house elf lifespans. Looney had been gifted to Macnair at an early age since he was the heir to the Macnair family. Macnair had taken to calling her Looney when several times she had failed to mind her tongue and ask questions. ‘A damn crazed house elf, that thing.’ That was all Macnair had said to her about the poor creature, aside from as the new Mrs. Macnair, Looney was indentured to her as well. The new Mrs. Macnair. Grief overwhelmed Molly. Over a month had passed, each day only increasing the pain. How she missed Arthur and their children. Molly wanted nothing more than to be home, curled safely in her husband’s -her real husband’s- arms, as the kids tramped through the house, laughter echoing through the yard.“Mistress Molly?” The tiny squeak of the house elf’s voice pulled Molly from her thoughts. Looney stood before her, soap and towel in hand. Molly had asked the elf to only call her Mistress Macnair around the Death Eaters to spare her from punishment, but here, between the two of them, she had asked to be called Molly.“Yes?” Molly asked, leaning towards the house elf with a warm smile.“May I wash your hair, Mistress? And help you dry off?” Looney had always been sweet to Molly, since the first morning she had awoken, gripped in a horrid pain. Looney had drawn her a hot bath with oils to relax Molly’s muscles and soothe her aches. Molly nodded her consent and laid back, so her hair dipped into the water. Looney’s hands found her hair and began massaging water and soap into the scalp gently. Molly let out a sigh.“Hey, I wanted to ask you something, but don’t want it to seem rude. May I ask it?” Silence followed Molly’s question as the elf continued to rinse the soap from her hair.“Whatever my Mistress wishes, I will do my best to comply. If I am unable to meet your request, I shall punish myself for it. The only thing I cannot do is what Master has forbade me from doing for you.” Helping her to escape. Molly wasn’t stupid. She knew there were wards that disabled disapparation within the walls of the Manor, and that house elves could perform magic right through wizard’s wards. But no, her question had nothing to do with escape, only the idea of respect.“I don’t care for calling you Looney. I hate it whenever I call you by name. You are not crazy simply for being curious and asking questions. So, I wanted to know if I could call you by a new name. One of your own choosing. You have been so kind to me, and it seems the very least I can do, offer you respect. Would that be all right with you?” Sometime during Molly’s rambling the hands had stopped rinsing her hair. Now they shook gently, sending little ripples through the water of the tub. “Did I say something wrong?”“No, Mistress Molly. I am not offended by what you ask, I am grateful. Never before have I been seen as respectable enough to be given a name- a true name, by a witch or wizard. I am most grateful. All I ask is that you choose the name, not me. It will mean so much more to be called by a name you chose for me, if I may so ask, Mistress.” Again, her hands began to massage the last of the soap from Molly’s hair and continued down, rolling gently over the knots under Molly’s skin. Molly thought for a moment about this, coming up with a name she had never heard before.“Nia? I have never heard of someone named Nia, so it would be entirely your own.”“I would be very grateful to be called Nia by my Mistress.” Molly could almost hear the tears in Nia’s voice as she continued to lather soap over her tired body. She left the conversation there as Nia washed the soap from her skin before moving around to drain the tub. Holding a thick, fluffy towel out as Molly stood. Molly accepted the towel and wrapped it around her frame, stepping from the tub she made sure to get her footing on the tile before shifting her weight and taking the other leg out. Molly padded softly to the wardrobe in the bedroom, which was now, thankfully, empty aside from her and Nia. She pulled a floor length dress that was a soft bottle green, low cut across the chest and flowed out at the waist. A gold serpent emblazoned between the breasts. Every bloody thing in this house is green, isn’t it? Surely her wardrobe was, as well as the room they lived in, and every single other room Molly had entered so far had been embellished with dark greens and wood tones. As she pulled the dress on, Macnair re-entered the room.“Come, Molly. Today you are going to learn a lesson. Molly glanced at Macnair in confusion. Every night she had done as he asked, laying herself before him in bed and not putting up a fight as he took her. What had she done wrong? Macnair grabbed her wrist and led her from the room. “I see your confusion but do not understand where it comes from. Yes, you have been doing well during our time together at night, yet still you do not willingly give yourself to me. That is different from letting me take you, and one day I hope you will enjoy our coupling as much as I do, but that is not the problem. No, the problem is you defying my orders the first time they are spoken and defying the orders of the other Death Eaters here in the Manor. Today, you will be receiving your lesson from Rodolphus. He has been warned to only hurt, if her goes as far as he did last time, I will kill him myself. You chose a horrible outfit; I can already guess some of the torture he will plan when he sees you.” Cold flooded through Molly’s chest as she followed Macnair through the hallways, down several flights of stairs. They stopped before a heavy wooden door in a drafty corridor, Macnair extending his hand. The knock echoed throughout the hall behind them.“Hello, Walden, and hello beautiful.” His eyes were not on her own but focused on her breasts held together by the flimsy cloth of the dress.“Have your fun, Rodolphus, but do remember I want her in working condition for tonight. Oh, and if you are going to play with her, please make sure it isn’t traditional. I don’t want there to be any question in relations to parentage, please.” With a swish of his cloak, Macnair turned back the way they had come. Leaving her entirely alone with Rodolphus Lestrange. Rodolphus grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her into the room.“Colloportus.” The lock behind them clicked shut, locking Molly in with him. He led her to a table where several instruments were laid out, shining and ready for use. “I will say, muggles may be useless in almost every single way, but the things they come up to torture one another with is a gift.” He slid a pair of heavy, rusted pair of manacles from the table, sliding them over her wrists. Once they were tightened, he lifted her hands above her head, catching the chain on a hook hanging from the ceiling. “Now, where shall we start? Possibly with magic, since it’s the least fun, huh?” He chuckled, pulling his wand from his pocket. He traced the tip of the wand down her body, drawing the skirt up to her thighs before letting it drop once more. Stepping back, he looked her over, smiling, as he whispered “Crucio.” Molly’s body convulsed as she let out a horrific scream. Every nerve in her body was burning at once, she felt as if her body was going to be consumed by the flames licking her. A brief second of relief rolled through her, before it started again. “Crucio!” Rodolphus was laughing now, as he watched Molly hang from her chains, her body shaking, her screams echoing around him. However, he had enough with the Cruciatus curse, wanting to get to the fun things that would physically scar her for life. Lifting the spell he turned to the table, setting his wand back into his pocket he perused the weapons assembled before him. He would work his way up, healing her wounds after each round to ensure she would be alive and awake for the next round. Selecting a small silver dagger he turned back to Molly, looking her over. She was taking shuddering gasps as she tried to support her weight on her feet, not looking towards him or the table assembled.“Now, where to begin?” He mused, eyes tracing over her body. He lifted the skirt one more, gently dragging the blade along the flesh he exposed. He traced lazily along her right leg, drawing unseen patterns, and relishing in the way her breath caught as his knife turned new directions.  Reaching the skin of her inner thigh, he turned the blade sideways and cut down, carving a chunk of skin from Molly’s thigh. She pulled away screaming as the pain flooded her body, but the chains held her from going too far. Her cries dampened some as she clenched her teeth and glared at Rodolphus, hatred burning in her eyes. Rodolphus merely laughed, stabbing the knife into her, between some ribs. Molly sagged forward, her head hanging as she cried. Choosing one final cut, he dragged his blade down her right arm from her shoulder to wrist. Blood was dripping onto the floor below her, pooling. Rodolphus tosses the dagger on top of the table to his left. Pulling his wand back out he pointed to each of her wounds, muttering.“Vulnera Sanentur.” The deep cuts on her body closed as his wand passed over each one. Though the wound was healed the pain remained. Rodolphus wasn’t the best healer, the spell did its’ job, but the scarring was harsh. The blood still on her body began to dry as Rodolphus planned his next attack on her weakened body. His eyes settled onto her left leg and walked around to the side of her body looking for the best place make his next move. Raising his foot into the air, he struck his heavy boot down at an angle across her knee, snapping her leg sideways. Molly shrieked as her weight dropped, now resting on the manacles around her wrist. The pain in her knee was excruciating. Molly begged for death to hurry along and claim her as the pain radiated up to her hip and down to her toes. Rodolphus unhooked her chain from the hook suspending her, allowing her to drop heavily to the floor. Raising his wand once more, he uttered “Brackium Emendo.” Molly cried out as the bones in her leg rightened themselves into nearly the same position they had been in before. “Damn, you are going to have a hell of a limp with that one,” Rodolphus chuckled as he stood to assess the table once more. With a flick of his wand the tools and weapons on the table arranged themselves neatly in the cupboards at the other end of the room, leaving his table empty. Grasping Molly by the hair he dragged her up, tossing her onto the table.“Now, Macnair said I was allowed to play with you, but I can’t in the normal way. Oh well, luckily we have options.” Rodolphus rolled Molly onto her stomach, pushing her until her thighs were flush against the table. Sliding his hands under her skirt, he pulled them up and tossed them over her. Molly whimpered as Rodolphus pushed her legs apart and slipped her underwear down her legs, tossing them to the side. His hand slid over her, stroking a few times before moving up higher.“No. Please Rodolphus, not there! Please don’t do this!” Molly hadn’t begged since her first night here but what Rodolphus was about to do to her was unthinkable. Not even she and Arthur ever dared to try it; it was a filthy act. Rodolphus let loose a cruel laugh as she felt him disrobe behind her. A tear slipped from Molly’s eye as Rodolphus prepared himself behind her, but Molly refused any more beyond that. She would not whimper in fear. She would not beg him anymore. She would stay as silent as she could and try to bear through what was about to happen. She heard Rodolphus spit behind her and flinched as his saliva landed on her. She grasped tightly the edge of the table in front of her as he pressed himself against her, slowly pushing in. This was easily a thousand times worse than anything Macnair had done to her in her time here, the pressure and pain tinging Molly’s vision black. Despite her best effort a scream escaped past her lips. Rodolphus increased his pace behind her, grasping her hip to help pull her towards him. While the pain never lessened, at least the pressure did as Molly’s body accommodated to the intrusion pressed deep inside her. Molly cried as Rodolphus’ pace stuttered, holding her hips close and spending himself inside of her. As he slipped out, she felt some of his sperm dripping from her, down her legs.“Damn you are tight. I can see why Macnair keeps you around. Anyway, we had better go, we don’t want to be late to the ceremony.” What ceremony? Molly didn’t bother asking, Rodolphus didn’t seem to be the type who would care whether she was up to date on information or not. He released the manacles from her wrist and walked towards the door, holding it open for her. “I hope you have learned your lesson. When you argue or disobey, you get to come spend time with me. Much as I enjoyed this, I doubt you did very much. Now hurry along. Molly erected herself as straight as she could manage for the amount of pain she was in. Slowly she stumbled after Rodolphus, noticing that he had been correct; her leg was poorly healed and most likely she would never walk without a limp again. The pain in her backside blinded Molly for a moment as she took a step forward. This was the only injury he had not healed and seemed to have no intention of as she limped towards him. Slowly they made their way through the Manor, back up a staircase and to the main floor. Stood beside the grand staircase was Macnair, Lucius, and Narcissa. Narcissa paled at seeing the state Molly was in but gave no further sign of concern for the other woman as she finally made her way over to the group.“Now, Molly, you are here to make the Unbreakable Vow. Are you ready?” Macnair pulled Molly closer to him, so that they were standing across from one another. Molly stared blankly at him.“I’m sorry? There has been no mention of an Unbreakable Vow before now, why are we making one?” Molly expected a blow for speaking out of turn, but Macnair simply laughed.“Because Mollywobbles my dear, you continue to defy or question the orders given to you. And I believe I have something of great importance to you on the table.”“And what may that be, Walden?” Pulling Molly closer, he whispered into her ear.“The safety of your family. Make the Vow with me, and I will do my best to make sure they remain unharmed. How is that for a deal?” Molly pulled away from Macnair and glared at him. As angry as she was at him using her family as a threat against her, she also knew this may be her best chance to protect them. She also knew that the terms would bind them together until one of them died. And she was well aware that it was going to be her. Extending her hand to his, she grasped his and grasped it firmly. Lucius stepped forward as their Bonder, setting the tip of his wand on their clasped hands.“Will you, Walden Macnair, restrain from harming my family in any way, direct or indirectly?” Molly asked, keeping eye contact.“I will.” A fiery red rope tangled around their hands.“Will you refrain from sending others to harm my family in your place?”“I will.” A second rope of fire intertangled with the first, binding further together.“Will you do your best to keep others from harming my family, as much as you are able to do so?”“I will.” A third rope of red fire tangled their hands, fading gently into their hands. Now it was Macnair’s turn.“Molly, will you swear yourself to me and my commands of you?” Taking a deep breath, Molly steeled herself for the choice she was about to make.“I will.” A red rope snaked around their hands once more.“Will you swear to obey the orders of other Death Eaters as they are given to you, whether through me or not?” Molly bit the inside of her cheek. It was too late to go back now, anyhow.“I will.” A second rope of fire coiled around their hands.“And Molly, will you swear to take even the orders of the Dark Lord himself upon His return; whatever they may be?” Fear clutched Molly’s heart as she weighed his request, but she knew what her answer would be. To protect her family, she would give everything she had.“I will.” The third rope of fire entangled them once more, the three tightening until they faded into their skin.“Perfect. Now come here, Mollywobbles.” Anger burned in her chest as Macnair called her by Arthur’s pet name, but she tamped it down and stiffly limped towards him. “I see Rodolphus had his fun with you, shame for the limp but that can’t always be helped when it comes to healing, huh?” Macnair pulled her with him towards their room. “Narcissa, could you bring me a healing potion, please?” Macnair called over his shoulder. Molly didn’t catch whether she responded as they turned a corner. Arriving to the room Macnair deposited Molly beside the tub, filling it with hot water. “Looney, come!” He cried, walking out of the bathroom. “Clean up well, Molly, we will be going out as soon as you are freshened up.” With that Macnair left the bedroom, closing the door behind him. A loud SNAP echoed through the room and Nia appeared, picking up the bar of soap once more, and a comb.“Mistress Molly, what happened to you?” Nia’s lamp like eyes filled with tears as she cataloged the injuries spotting her mistress. A knock sounded at the door and Nia left to answer it, returning with a bottle of deep red liquid. “Mistress Malfoy has brought you a healing potion, Ma’am. Drink, and you will feel much better.” Molly took the bottle from Nia and upended it, finishing quickly. Already she could feel the pain numbing as the potion took effect. Gingerly Molly stepped into the tub, laying back so that Nia could wash and comb her hair. Nia worked quietly, untangling the knots that Rodolphus had put into it. Then taking the soap she lathered Molly’s body and rinsed it, helping pull her from the now rust colored bath water. Nia dried her off gently, taking extra care with the parts of her body that had been injured. Nia ran and pulled a dress from the wardrobe, a silk black dress that hugged under her breasts and flared at the hips. Picking up a pair of sandals as well Nia returned, helping Molly into the dress. Macnair entered a few minutes later, holding a glass.“I want one thing to be clear. My first command of you is that you may not try to leave, given any opportunity. If you see the possibility to escape on missions, or are left here alone, you do not take the chance to run. Is this understood?” Molly nodded. “And the second is that given the opportunity, you may not harm any of us. Whether magically or by your hand.” Molly nodded once more. “Good girl. Now, drink this.” Molly took the drink and smelled it, scrunching her nose at the horrific odor. The potion was a deep blue and thin.“What is this, Walden?” She asked, smelling it once more. She took a large drink and dropped the glass, running for the toilet. She could feel her stomach rolling, trying to expel the foul liquid from her body.“Polyjuice Potion. We chose a woman of similar height, age, and build as you. We are going to visit the ministry today, and you will be introduced as my new wife. A supporter of our cause, a Pureblood from Ireland gave her hair for us today. That’s your story and stick to it. You were born in Ireland in 1951, attended Durmstrang. We met in 1990 on holiday in France, and you decided to come here to marry me. Your name was Molly Flint, a branch of the Flint family who grew up abroad, born in Ireland. Now you are my new wife, Molly Macnair.” Molly’s skin felt like wax, it bubbled and reformed over her bones, changing her appearance. Her face was longer, she was slightly taller. Thinner, as well. Her brown eyes were now a deep green and her fiery red hair had turned to a deeper auburn. Wrinkles lined around her mouth and eyes. Macnair stepped beside her, placing a simple gold band on her finger. “Perfect, let’s go.” Molly hesitated. She could not face the world knowing she there was nothing she could do to escape. “Molly, come.” Still, she hesitated where she stood. Quick as lighting, the feeling of fire began scorching her hand. Looking down she saw the three ropes of fire heating up, burning her. She turned quickly towards Macnair and limped past him, the fire and light dying on her hand as she obeyed her command.Macnair led her through the Manor to a fireplace, a floo powder pot sitting above the mantel. Macnair pulled her into the fireplace with her and threw a handful of floo powder down, shouting “Ministry of Magic!” The feeling of jerking behind Molly’s navel dragging her along with Macnair towards London. Once they arrived the emerald flames around them died and they stepped out of a hearth into the marbled floors of the Atrium for the Ministry of Magic. A young wizard in uniform stepped forward with his wand and blew the excess ash from their clothing. As they walked towards the check in desk, Macnair handed molly a wand. It was foreign to her, a dark wood and shorter than her own wand was, but a wand none the less. Even a few days ago this would have filled Molly with joy, but now, it was nothing more than a mockery of her entrapment. They arrived at the check in desks, Molly grasping Macnair’s elbow in an attempt to hold herself upright.“Names and wands, please?” The attendant asked, holding out her hand. They both extended their wands for the woman to take, each giving their name to her. “Newlyweds, huh? Gives me hope at my age maybe I can find someone too. Make sure to get that last name changed as soon as you can, ma’am, even going around saying your name is Macnair when it hasn’t changed can get you into trouble some places, but I won’t mention it to anyone. Have a wonderful day!” Taking their wands back Molly followed Macnair through the Atrium and towards the lifts. It was hard keeping up with his long stride as she limped along behind him. Entering the lift, they began to descend. One floor down the lift opened once more, and Molly’s heart sank. Arthur stepped onto the lift, barely giving more than a glance towards either her or Macnair. Molly begged for Arthur to recognize her, to take her home away from this man and heal her, but that hope was dashed as Macnair started a conversation with Arthur.“So, Weasley, how is the search for your wife going?” A deep weight settled over Molly as Arthur tensed and turned towards Macnair.“Not well. No leads. The Auror’s assumption based off the state of our house is that she most likely was dead or dying-” Arthur’s voice broke, and tears filled Molly’s eyes. She wanted nothing more wrap her arms around him gently and hold him, let her know she was here and safe as long as he never let her go. Macnair grinned towards her.“This is my new wife, Molly Macnair. She is one of the Flint girls from the Irish branch. Met her on vacation in France last year and somehow wooed her, can you believe it?” Arthur’s eyes glanced up and met Molly’s. She stared him down, hoping he would recognize the expression she was giving him. And for a second, it seemed he did. Brief recognition came over Arthur’s face, before his stony countenance returned. He looked away from her.“Congratulations, Macnair. Didn’t see that coming for you, truly didn’t. I guess there is someone out there for everyone.” Molly stepped forward, closing the gap between her and Macnair, and in turn, the gap between her and Arthur. He noticed her limp as she settled onto her good leg, holding Macnair’s arm for support. “What happened to your leg, Molly?” The name was strained as it left his lips. Molly’s heart was breaking as she looked into the eyes of the man she loved and lied.“During our vacation in France we went hiking. I fell down an icy slope and through a drop-off. Broke my knee when I landed. Walden climbed down to me and carried me down the mountain. Unfortunately, there weren’t any healers in town, nor did we know where to find any, so I asked Walden to heal my leg for me. Turns out he isn’t that much better of a healer than I am, so now I have a limp. Even the medi-witches at St. Mungos are unable to help me. But that’s alright. Even though I will limp for the rest of my life, I got an amazing man in return.” Both she and Macnair were surprised at the story that rolled off her tongue, but Macnair seemed content with it as he pulled Molly into a deep kiss. Molly scrunched her eyes and waited for it to be over, before looking at the floor, feigning embarrassment. Had she looked up she would have seen the look of confusion in Arthur’s eyes as the voice of his missing wife came from the body of another woman.“Come, now, Molly, we don’t want to waste the blood traitors time anymore, do we?” Molly knew where he was leading with this. His entire purpose for bringing her out today had been to run into Arthur and see her reaction, and now he wanted to use this interaction to hurt her. She steeled herself and looked up in disgust.“A filthy blood traitor. Really? Walden, why did you introduce me to this man? I thought he was one of the regarded Pureblood families, like ours are. Not filth. Please, take me home so I can wash his presence from my skin!” The doors to the lift opened, revealing the second floor which housed Arthur’s office. Arthur was as red as his hair as he turned to Molly, steam nearly pouring from his ears. “You and I have very different ideas as to what dirties the name of wizards, Macnair.” He nearly spit the words at them as he turned and left the lift, the doors closing behind him.“Well, that seems to surely have riled him up, eh Mollywobbles? Now, to pick up those papers I needed.” Molly followed Macnair, tears streaming from her eyes as silent sobs wracked her body. Surely, one day, her luck had to change. But as Molly trailed after Macnair back out to the Atrium and through the fireplace back into Malfoy Manor, not only was her hope diminishing but her desire to return home as well. If she ever did escape here, what could be left for her with Arthur after all the things she has done? After all of the things yet to come?

Molly woke up with her stomach rolling. She pulled herself from the bed and limped carefully into the bathroom, trying not to wake Macnair up behind her. She shut the door quietly and flicked the light on, crawling towards the toilet and emptying the contents of her stomach. Several minutes of heaving passed before her stomach finally settled. Several nights in a row this is the predicament in which Molly had found herself, huddled in the bathroom alone, in the middle of the night. Her mind slipped back to the nights she had spent with Arthur on the bathroom floor, Molly’s stomach flipping and Arthur holding back her hair as she retched. He would rub her back gently until the nausea subsided, whispering gently to her. The next morning, he would always bring her toast and tea in bed before he left for work. Where she sat now was a cold comparison. Settling her hand gently on to her lower abdomen, she sighed. Her hope had been that maybe, just maybe, it had been a bug.“Well, we know what this means, don’t we, little one.” Molly leaned her back against the tub wall behind her, drawing her knees up to her chest. Tears slid down her cheeks, as she pressed her face forward into her knee to muffle her sobs. Never in a million years had Molly thought she was going to be pregnant again. She and Arthur had taken precautions after Ginny’s birth, there were simply too many mouths to feed. Disgust filled Molly at the realization that this child permanently tied her to Macnair. No, the child was not at fault, they could not be blamed for the actions of the man in the other room. Her disgust lay with him, and him alone. In all of this, the child growing in her womb was the only innocent one among them. In truth, Molly was equally guilty of the actions that had led her here. Even if their first night she had been cursed into submission, she had given in not soon after and allowed Macnair to use her as he pleased. And barely a month in she formed an Unbreakable Vow with the man, tying her to himself in submission until one of them died. Yes, Molly was guilty. Collecting herself she flushed the toilet and left the bathroom, turning out the light.The next morning Molly groggily opened her eyes to the light streaming in from the large window beside the bed. Macnair was nowhere to be seen, and Molly guessed it was later than she had expected to wake. Late enough that Macnair had already left for work. As she stretched and stood from the bed, Nia entered the room with a soft knock.“Mistress Molly, Mistress Malfoy requests your presence at the breakfast table in an hour’s time. Would you care for help preparing?” Nia bowed low before Molly, her long nose and the tips of her floppy ears brushing the floor.“Nia, you know you don’t need to bow for me,” Molly chuckled, walking towards the bathroom. “And yes, some help would be appreciated.” Nia followed along after Molly’s footsteps, pulling a towel and soap from the cupboards. Once Molly had been thoroughly washed and dried, Nia helped her to dress in a forest green dress that stopped below her knees. A faux corset laced up the torso and pressed her breasts higher up than they had been in many years. The outfits Macnair chose for her were gaudy to say the least, and not necessarily something she would have ever chosen for herself, but in the time since she had come here, she had lost some of the weight she had carried the last ten years and had to admit these dresses did look good on her. Pairing the dress with a pair of soft black flats she followed Nia to the mirror was, she pulled her hair into a loose braid and twisted it into a bun. Her eyes fell to the stained and crusted pillowcase that Nia wore. She knew she was not allowed to give Nia new clothes, but surely these could be washed.“Nia, I know I cannot give you any new clothes, but am I able to wash that? It has years of stains and cannot be hygienic.” Nia stared at her blankly.“We do not wash our clothes, Mistress Molly. To show we need nothing, accept what our Master asks of us.” Her statement was devoid of emotion, as if Molly were supposed to have known this. And, Molly supposed, she would have known this if she had been born to a family who owned a house elf.“Well then I ask that you clean your clothes. An elf of the Macnair household should reflect the house itself, should it not?” Molly winked at Nia. Nia smiled back at her, overjoyed for the loophole Molly found allowing herself to put her own cleanliness on her list of tasks. Albeit, exceptionally low on that list of tasks. “You may use our tub to do so today before Master Macnair returns home. Any punishment he sees fit to serve I shall take myself for assigning you the task.” This faltered Nia’s smile, as she never wanted Mistress Molly to be punished. “And Nia?” Molly drew herself as close to eye level as she could manage with her damaged knee.“Yes, Mistress Molly?” Nia asked.“If there was ever the possibility, would you consider leaving the service of Master Macnair? Let’s say, if I ever got to leave, would you follow with me? As a member of the Macnair household, would that be a choice for you?” Molly bit her cheek, wondering if she had crossed a line with that question. Nia burst into tears and wrapped her skinny arms around Molly’s leg that was kneeled before her.“The only way Nia could do this, Mistress Molly, is if Master Macnair passed with no heir, or you have an heir, and my service is passed on to them. But if either of these things happen, then yes, Mistress Molly, I would like nothing more than to enter your service.” For the first time since the morning sickness had fallen over Molly, her heart soared.“Nia, I need you to keep this between you and I for now, alright?” The seriousness in Molly’s voice took Nia aback. Nodding, her bat-like ears flapping with the movement, Nia stood quietly in anticipation of the news Molly planned to share with her.“Nia, I believe that I am pregnant. Maybe it’s too early to tell, but I have had seven children before this and have not been wrong the last few times.” Molly’s voice trailed off as she gazed to the floor. Silence met her confession. The arms around her leg tightened as Nia let out a yelp.“Mistress Molly is going to have an heir!” Though thoroughly excited, Nia had managed to keep her voice to nearly a whisper with her exclamation. Molly laughed, hugging Nia back with the arm that wasn’t supporting her. Nia pulled away and wiped the tears from her eyes with the pillowcase she wore. “Now come, Mistress Molly, before we are late for breakfast with Mistress Malfoy.” Nia led Molly from the room, walking at a slower pace to accommodate Molly’s limp. Coming to the dining room, Molly felt her stomach flip once again as several scents assailed her. Forcing herself to walk stiffly forward she sat beside across from Narcissa to the empty setting. Taking a sip of water, Molly kept her eyes from Narcissa, but also from the displeasing scent coming from the meat sat before her. Pulling only a slice of toast towards her, she waited for Narcissa to speak. She wasn’t left waiting long.“So, Molly, how are you enjoying your time at Malfoy Manor?” Molly snorted at the question. Narcissa nodded, conceding the question. “I wanted to take this time when we are alone to talk to you. Everyone else in the Manor is either at work or on a mission for You-Know-Who. We are here, alone. So, any questions you have, fire away. I have only one after seeing your reaction to the food before us today. Are you pregnant with Macnair’s heir?” Molly chewed her lip. There was no point in lying about her suspicions. If she was correct, everyone would know in a few months anyway. And if she were wrong, only her and Narcissa would know.“I believe I am, yes.” Narcissa nodded her head softly.“I will do everything in my power to protect you from Rodolphus and Bellatrix during your pregnancy. Most likely they will not be an issue, but they are volatile and easily angered. Remember that Molly.” Narcissa leaned back from her barely touched plate of food.“You said that I could ask anything, correct?” Molly inquired.“Anything I know the answer to. And I will be honest either way.” Molly nodded, thinking of which question to ask first.“Why are you trying to help me? The Malfoy’s were aligned with You-Know-Who during the wizarding war, so why help a blood traitor like me when my punishment came.”“Because, Molly, even I don’t fully agree with the atrocities committed during that time, and the ones looming in the near future. I married for status and look where it has gotten me. Trapped, the same as you. Almost the same as you, anyway. I learned to keep my tongue, bow my head, and obey orders much quicker and without the pressure of an Unbreakable Vow.” Molly digested her words. She had been correct in her assumption, Narcissa had no say in her allegiance to the Death Eaters. More accurately, she didn’t even swear allegiance to them, but through the association of her husband.“What are they planning? What has You-Know-Who put in place, and how is he alive?” Narcissa didn’t respond right away, choosing her response carefully.“To that, I do not fully know the answer. Only the small parts Lucius has mentioned to me, or the parts I have overheard walking these halls. To the best of my knowledge, the answer to your second question is a deeply hidden form of magic known as Horcruxes. I do not know how they are made or how they work, so please do not ask me. What I do know is that it is an item which someone places a piece of their soul. A man not fully mortal cannot be killed. While the Dark Lord’s physical body perished in Godric’s Hollow all those years ago, his soul did not. The piece inside his body did, but several more items holding the other fragments are scattered across Europe. They are working on creating him a new body. You are going to be angry with what I have to say next, but please understand. I have no sway in the actions unfolding, and they were set in motion many months ago, even before your Unbreakable Vow was formed. Regardless, I doubt Macnair knows the full extent of the plans anyway. His use and mission lie elsewhere.” Molly’s mind was reeling at the information Narcissa had shared with her.“The plan that is unfolding now is to bring the Dark Lord back from one of these Horcruxes. To retrieve the memory of him from the item his soul is trapped in, and trade it for a life in our world. Lucius was given one of the Horcruxes during the height of the Dark Lord’s power, and at the beginning of this year he was instructed to pass it on to a student. The diary, owned by the Dark Lord during his days at Hogwarts, would corrupt the soul of the one in possession of the book. Bending her to his will, to commit horrible crimes to other students at the school.” Narcissa paused, taking the moment to clear her throat and collect herself. “And once he has full control of her, he will drain the life from her body and come forth into this world the same as his memory from fifty years ago.” Molly processed her words carefully.“What crimes is she committing towards the other students? And what poor child have you chosen to sacrifice to bring such a nightmare into the waking world?” Narcissa did not meet her eyes.“As for the other students, she is releasing a basilisk hidden deep beneath the school onto the muggle-borns. The aim was to kill them, but as of now none have yet died, only petrification has occurred. And as to who was chosen, he made it clear that the child must be a Pureblood, but he did not want to waste potential. So, he chose the daughter of known blood traitors.” Molly balked at Narcissa’s words.“Not? You don’t mean?” Molly couldn’t form the words, but Narcissa’s silence and hanging head told her all she needed to know. “Not my daughter, you bitch!” She jumped from the table and stormed from the room, Narcissa following awkwardly at her heels.“Molly, I am sorry. I didn’t know how to approach you about this! The choice was made before you came here to use one of your children. Ginevra posed the perfect opportunity, but please believe me if I could have changed the outcome I would have!” Narcissa’s voice broke as she caught the wall beside her, leaning her weight against it. “I cannot imagine the pain of watching Draco used as a pawn like this to further a plan, but I fear one day he will end up the same as Ginevra, a steppingstone towards the Dark Lord’s vision of a future. The reason I wanted to talk to you today was to extend a white flag. Regardless of the information I receive, I cannot protect anyone or turn a decision. But I will do my best to keep you informed, and make sure you are not alone within the walls of this Manor. I seek a relationship in this house that is not in danger of me being thrown down in order to rise in favor, and I know you wish not to be known. Molly stopped at the end of the hallway, shifting her weight to her good leg.“Narcissa…” Her emotions were whirling inside of her. She could not make heads or tails of the situation before her. Yes, Narcissa had known for some time the plan to sacrifice her daughter to bring You-Know-Who back, but at the same time what could she possibly do to stop it? She was in the same position as Molly. A vehicle to bear an heir to a name and status. Molly turned back towards Narcissa. “Your white flag is accepted but I am very cross right now.” Molly turned and limped back to her room. Settling heavily into the bed she curled on her side and tried to fight back tears. Hugging a pillow close to her chest, Molly gave in and sobbed. For the child she was going to lose, for the child she was going to bear, and for the children she would never see again. Molly pulled the article she had torn out of the Daily Prophet her first day here from under the mattress and opened to the picture of her and Arthur.It had been taken about two years before, as the whole family came together for Christmas at The Burrow. Their last Christmas as a family. Molly stroked the moving picture of her and Arthur, watching the two figures hug each other softly before smiling for the camera. Arthur leaned over and pecked a kiss on Molly’s cheek. Her fingertips ghosted across the place his lips had long ago and for a second, she swore she could feel his day-old fuzz brush her gently. The feeling faded and reality crashed back into her. She folded the paper back up and gently placed it back under the mattress, pulling the pillow tight to her chest once more. Nia exited from the bathroom beside her, her pillowcase wet but scrubbed spotless, and the layer of grime that had covered her was now gone. She padded to the side of Molly’s bed and faced her.“Mistress Molly, is there anything I can do for you?” Molly stared blankly back at Nia, trying to process her request. Her body answered for her as Molly’s stomach growled loudly. “I can get food for Mistress, yes, Nia can do that!” Nia gently shut the door of the room behind her, leaving Molly alone once more. She rolled her body over to face the windows, watching the peacocks. Nia returned not soon after, with a bowl of chicken noodle soup.“Chicken soup is good for baby, says Mistress Malfoy. Lots of good vitamins to help baby grow.” Nia set the bowl of soup on the bedside table with a handful of saltine crackers next to it. Molly pulled the crackers to her, hoping the salt would settle her stomach enough for the soup to be palatable. Nia extinguished some of the candles above their heads, dimming the light. Molly sipped the broth from her soup before setting the bowl full of meat, vegetables, and noodles back onto the table beside her. Pulling the blanket over her exhausted frame, Molly fell into an uneasy sleep.“Molly, wake up.” A hand grasped her leg. Molly startled out of her sleep as Macnair settled himself onto the bed beside her. Pulling Molly forward, he kissed her roughly, his hand entangled in her hair. Molly pulled away from Macnair, her hand flying to cover her mouth. Between staggering on her sleep weak legs and the limp, Molly barely made it to the toilet in time to expel her meager lunch from earlier. Macnair followed her into the bathroom, putting two and two together. “Molly, I sure hope this means you are pregnant, and it simply isn’t a reaction to my kiss.” Molly let out a huff between retches, before another one overtook her. Soon the retching turned to dry heaves and Molly pulled herself away from the toilet, flushing it. Macnair sat on the floor beside her.“So, there is going to be a child soon?” Molly let the question hang in the air for a moment as she tried to quell the nausea still rolling in her stomach. She merely nodded her head in affirmation, her hands settling once again over her abdomen as saliva pooled in her mouth. “An heir to the Macnair name. I am proud of you, Molly. A fine boy we will have! Of course, he shall receive my name as the next master of the house.” Molly didn’t dare ask what would occur if the child was a girl. She wiped the tear trailing down her cheek, swallowing the sniffle that threatened to escape. “Come to bed, Molly.” Molly bit her lip as Macnair helped her to her feet, clutching her hand tightly. Setting her gently onto the mattress he slid the dress up her body, exposing the skin of her stomach.“Soon, my love, you shall grow round with our child. Through you, my bloodline now merges with one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.” His hand pressed roughly against the skin below Molly’s navel. Sitting back Macnair pulled the wand from his pocket and set it on the nightstand beside him. Molly’s eyes lingered on the wand for a moment before she curled back and turned away to lower the bottom of her dress to cover herself once more. Macnair’s hand stopped her, pulling the hem back up and off of her. “Let us celebrate, Molly.” Her heart sank as he climbed on top of her, claiming her body once more.

Molly awoke to the feeling of intense pressure weighing on her bladder. Looking to the window for an estimation on time she knew it must be fairly close to morning as light filtered over the horizon outside. Awkwardly she attempted to disentangle herself from the sheets, the process greatly hindered by her swollen abdomen. Finally pulling free she stood and stretched. Macnair stirred beside her, disrupted by the feeling of her leaving the bed.“What time is it?” He inquired, rubbing sleep from his eyes.“Early. Go back to sleep if you can, the baby woke me.” Macnair nodded and nestled himself deeper into the bedding. Molly turned and limped towards the bathroom slowly. Easing onto the toilet behind her, she relieved herself quickly, sighing as the pressure diminished. She cleaned quickly and using the counter beside her she pulled herself into a standing position once more. After rinsing her hands, she settled back to rest against the counter. Sliding her hand onto her stomach, she stroked the protruding bump gently.“Good morning, little one.” Molly’s heart sank as she thought of the early mornings years ago, standing in this same position. Comparatively, however, during those times Arthur had stood with her. After the arrival of Bill and his consecutive siblings, those moments alone in the dead of night as morning marched closer had been theirs alone. A gentle nudge brought Molly’s attention back to the present, and back to the child she carried. “I promise you; you are so loved little one. Maybe not by those around us now, but I know that Arthur would love you regardless once he met you.” I hope. What if he doesn’t? But that seemed a problem far in the reaches of another reality. Molly knew the chances of her returning home were nearly non-existent. Time passed unknown to Molly as she stood there, softly drawing patterns on the skin of her stomach to the response of little nudges every so often. The soft nudges were soon overshadowed by a much sharper push. Groaning, Molly clutched the patch of ribs the baby had attempted to breach through. “You could go a little easier on me, you know. I am not as young as I once was,” She grumbled. Leaving the bathroom, Molly collected her outfit for the day and quickly changed.The smell of food wafted through the halls as Molly made her way towards the dining room, following the beckoning scent. The table before her was laden with food set for the Death Eaters before they made their way to their tasks for the day. Molly pulled a chair beside Narcissa, who was set with a scant plate of food before her. Her expanded middle kept her from sliding her chair too close to the edge of the table. Not too hungry herself, Molly pulled a half-filled plate towards herself and began pushing the meat back and forth with her fork.“Do you have any news on my daughter?” Molly whispered, hiding the question behind the mouthful of food. Just a few weeks before, the attempt to bring You-Know-Who back through the memory of his Horcrux had failed due to the intervention of Harry Potter.“Ginny is fine. Healing well. Ron was one of the students who helped, you know. Helped Harry to get down to the chamber. He was trapped outside while to actual fight occurred, but he helped to save her. They are all right.” Molly sighed in relief as the fear that had gripped her for the past few months finally lessened. She knew Ginny had survived the attempt, but details had not been made known to her. But still a sadness lingered at not getting to see her family as they grew. And poor young Harry, as well as the muggle-born girl, Hermione, that Ron had talked about in his letters the year before often crossed her mind. Taking small bites, Molly made small talk with Narcissa as different members made their way through before leaving for the day. The light outside had significantly strengthened as Lucius entered the room, carrying the Daily Prophet in his hands.“It seems that Sirius Black has escaped Azkaban.” He threw the paper onto the table and those seated at it began to whisper conversations amongst themselves. Molly watched the picture on the front page. A much older Sirius than the one she had remembered seeing years ago stared back, his filthy prison garb and wild hair attesting to the hardness of the years that has passed. But his eyes seemed so different than that of those she had seen here who returned from Azkaban. They held a fierce light in them.“I wonder where he is going to go, the Potter’s are dead. Dumbledore left him to rot in Azkaban, and the world thinks he is guilty of a crime he did not commit. He has nowhere to go.” The whisper reached Molly’s ear as Corbus Yaxley passed her and turned out of sight around the corner, speaking with Avery. Molly turned to Narcissa with her eyebrows furrowed.“What are they talking about? Sirius gave away the location of the Potter’s and killed poor Pettigrew to boot.” Narcissa nearly snorted into her teacup. Swirling it gently she collected her thoughts. Setting the cup back down on to the saucer she pushed her plate towards the center of the table and turned to face Molly.“No, Molly. My dear cousin did not sell the Potter’s out. He feared he couldn’t keep them safe, so he begged them to make Pettigrew the Secret Keeper. They trusted him, so they did as he asked. Pettigrew is the one who gave the location of the Potter’s to Voldemort. That pathetic little rat double crossed and swore his allegiance to the Dark Lord out of fear. Sirius was, and is, innocent.” Molly looked to the plate in front of her. Stabbing a piece of fruit with her fork she swirled it through some juice that had collected in the depression running the circumference of the plate.“What happened with Pettigrew and Sirius, then? Sirius was convicted of thirteen murders, for Merlin’s sake.” Molly was astounded at the revelation. The idea that young Sirius Black had turned sides and betrayed his friends was appalling to all who knew the man, but the doubt remained in all their minds. He was a Black, after all. Nearly evil, through and through. Andromeda Black, who had gone on to marry a muggle-born named Ted Tonks, and Sirius had seemed the exceptions.“Sirius went to the Potter’s that evening. They had told no one that they had switched Secret Keepers, though I do not doubt Dumbledore was fooled by their plot. Sirius left to act as a decoy and lead the Dark Lord down a false trail. When he never showed, Sirius became concerned and returned to Godric’s Hollow. He found their home in ruins, Harry the only survivor. He passed the child on to that half-giant, Hagrid. No doubt another part of Dumbledore’s plan. There is not a doubt in my mind that that man was behind everything that occurred that night. I cannot imagine why though. The Potter’s were loyal to, well, death. They and the Longbottom’s were the only ones who stood a chance of opposing him; why would Dumbledore allow someone so fickle and impressionable as Peter Pettigrew to be so near the center of his plans to stop the Dark Lord.” Molly’s mind was reeling, attempting to process the information Narcissa had just given her.“But why the Potter’s? And what did the Longbottom’s have to do with it? I thought it was unknown why You-Know-Who’s powers failed him that night.” The room had now emptied as the other Member’s trailed off to their day jobs, or to fulfill a mission they had been given. The silence around them was nearly oppressive.“Lucius told me this in confidence many years ago, but I know you won’t turn and pass along that I told you this. A prophecy was made the year before he fell. That a child would be born in July, to parents who had escaped him three times before. Frank and Alice Longbottom were in hiding from him, having defied his attempts three times. Their son was born at the end of July. And James and Lily Potter had done the same, their child born the last day of the month. He marked the Potter’s child as the one which the prophecy had spoken about and sent Bellatrix, Rodolphus, Rabastan, and Barty Crouch Jr. to handle the Longbottom’s. Those poor souls were tortured to insanity, I’m sure you remember. And he killed the Potter’s himself. It was old magic that spared the life of the little Potter boy; Lily’s sacrifice in order to protect him placed a powerful counter charm. It reflected the killing curse back onto the Dark Lord.”“And Peter Pettigrew?”“Sirius chased him down once he realized what he had done. That’s as far as I know. Pettigrew hasn’t been seen since, to this day the finger was all that remained. Sirius never spoke to anyone in Azkaban. Maintained his innocence. Whether or not he did kill those twelve muggles while chasing Pettigrew, he had intended to kill him.” Molly pulled the still folded newspaper towards her. The sight of Sirius Black now saddened her. He had spent the last twelve years in Azkaban for simply putting his faith into the wrong man. A smaller headline on the side of the page caught her eye. Weasley Family wins 700 Galleon draw; Holidays in Egypt. Molly shuffled through the pages until she found the mentioned article. Grand Prize Winner Visits Egypt

Arthur Weasley won the Grand Prizedraw of 700 Galleons early this summer.The father of seven decided to take his familyon a month-long trip to Egypt to visit his oldestson William, who works as a curse breakerwith Gringotts bank in Africa.“I feel like as a family, we needed a break.Between the horrors that happened at theschool this year, and the disappearance oftheir mother last fall, they deserved somerest and normalcy. We are having a grandtime here in Egypt with Bill!”The Weasley’s will return toLondon in time for the youngestfour children to attend Hogwarts inthe fall. Below the article was a large picture displaying Molly’s entire family. Even in the past year they had changed so much. Both Bill and Charlie had grown out their hair, it now reached down to their shoulders. Percy wore new glasses and seemed more grown up than even his older two brothers did. Fred and George stood side by side, matching down to their lopsided grins. Ron had grown taller, nearly reaching the height of the twins beside him and his hair a few inches longer. And little Ginny had grown as well, her face maturing and having grown nearly a foot since Molly had seen her last. Though looking a little weary, Ginny had a bright grin on her face, as she and all the Weasley’s around her waved furiously for the photo. And stood amongst the middle of them all was her Arthur. He seemed much older than the last time she had seen him. Aged years beyond the photo she had tucked away in the mattress. And, figuring all that the poor man had been through this last year, Molly was not entirely surprised by this. She could not imagine the strain of handling the family alone, the unease of not knowing where her husband was, or if he was even alive.Carefully, Molly tore this article out from the paper as well, tucking it and the photo of her family into the pocket of her robes. Tossing the paper into the fire she stood, Narcissa following her. They walked to the drawing room, Narcissa slowing her pace to match Molly’s uneven limp. Sitting down into the overstuffed chaise, Narcissa sat onto the couch beside her. Molly stretched her hand around her belly and absentmindedly stroked the protruding bump.“You miss your family.” It wasn’t a question. Even without the tone implying such, Molly knew Narcissa wasn’t that thick. Of course she missed her family, there was no doubts about that. What Narcissa was attempting to do was at least open up an opportunity for Molly to speak about it instead of hiding it away. Tears blurred Molly’s vision as she her hand ceased moving across her abdomen. Her chest tightened as she fought back a sob.“I miss my children. I am missing out on watching them grow up. I am doing my best to protect them from here, but it feels so very far from adequate to save them from what is coming. Even taking an Unbreakable Vow I couldn’t protect my daughter. I am trapped here, with no way out. I am going to die here, away from my family, forced to bear children to a man I despise. And Merlin, I miss Arthur!” Molly lost any control she had over her breathing. Hiccupping gasps escaped Molly as she covered her face and cried into her hand. In her womb she could feel the baby moving around in response to her stress. Narcissa’s hand gently crossed over onto Molly’s leg in a silent attempt to comfort the hurting woman.“Molly, I cannot imagine what you are going through right now. But I want to make a promise to you, if there one day comes a chance for me to help you escape from here, I will do my best. I swear to you.”“How c-can you possibly ho-ope to keep such a p-promise? I am held h-here by an u-Unbreakable Vow, which i-is to be held until I d-die, Nar-arcissa.” Molly covered her mouth in an attempt to regain control over her breathing. Narcissa looked away from the grieving woman and retracted her hand.“I don’t particularly know myself, but if I ever figure it out, I will let you know.” Molly snorted at her response and slowly regained control over her sobs.“I will be forever grateful to you if you could find a way out of this for me. But what about you? If there was a chance for you to take Draco and escape, would you?“In a heartbeat. His safety is my priority. As long as his best chance remains here in this house, we will stay. Once that changes, I will do anything to get him far away from here. But I know the chance of me being able to protect him is slim, the same as you with your children.” Molly wiped the last of her tears from her cheek and rested her other hand back onto her abdomen. The baby had settled with her sobs and now made no movements inside of her. Tracing gentle patterns on the bulge of her stomach she enjoyed the few minutes of silence that enveloped the room. A soft knock came from the partially closed doors to the drawing room and a quiet voice called to them.“Mistress Macnair? Mistress Malfoy? I bed pardon for my intrusion, but Master Macnair has asked to see the Mistress in their quarters.” Nia bowed her head forward to the floor, not looking at either woman. Molly sighed and struggled to her feet before Narcissa intervened and helped her to stand. Thanking her, and thanking Nia as she passed by, Molly limped out of the drawing room and down towards her room. Once inside, Macnair shut the door behind her.“Good girl, Molly. Coming when summoned is very good.” Molly bit her tongue in disgust as she hobbled towards him, taking advantage of the bed just beside him. Sitting down a bit awkwardly, she leaned back a little to remove as much weight as she could off her legs.“What did you need me for, sir?” Molly asked quietly.“You have been behaving well. I have been incredibly pleased with your performance these last few months, and I wanted to reward you for being good.” He pulled something out of his pocket and reached it forward towards her. It was Molly’s wand. “Now, I want to be very clear what it means for me to give this back to you, and what is expected of you. You are absolutely not to use magic to hurt myself, or anyone else here, is that clear? This included all the Death Eaters, or any who are sympathetic to our cause. Is that understood?” Molly nodded, still unsure that this wasn’t a trick. “And furthermore, that you may not use it to attempt an escape, to send messages, to indicate you need help, or anything of the like. Is that clear?” Molly nodded once more, her throat dry. “Good.” He held the wand out towards her.Hesitantly, Molly reached out to meet him, her fingers gently gliding over the notches of the familiar wood. The handle fit into her hand perfectly and felt at home, her fingers tightening over it and pulling it gently from Macnair’s hand.“And what do you say, Molly?”“Thank you, sir, for trusting me with my wand.” Molly’s mouth felt as if it were filled with cotton right now. She was in utter disbelief that he would give her the wand back under any circumstances. She looked at the wand for a moment, trying to convince herself that this was real and not her imagination. Macnair watched her closely, his eyes flicking from the wand to her face constantly. Molly looked at him and gently leaned forward, setting the wand onto the nightstand. “Thank you, sir.” She repeated, letting the wood slide from her hand. After months of not having the wand, to let it go now felt as if she were losing a part of her body all over again. Macnair nodded approvingly at her choice.“And one other thing. To mark you as my own property, that is. You may not take it off, understood?” Molly’s eyes fell on a leather collar Macnair pulled from his pocket. The breath caught in Molly’s throat, unable to form words to agree to his statement. She simply nodded, eyes remaining on the collar. “Good girl. Its waterproofed, so you won’t need it off to bathe.” He wrapped the collar gently around her neck, fastening it in the back with a small padlock. He dropped her hair back over the lock and stroked her shoulder gently, before removing his hand.“Good girl,” he repeated once more. He sat on the bed beside her, sinking the mattress further towards the floor. He leaned over and kissed Molly roughly, holding her in place with a hand tangled in her hair. “If only you had accepted my proposal years ago. This could have been ours all along.” Molly found herself incredibly grateful that she had denied him, and though she may never see Arthur again, she was thankful for the twenty-four years they’d had. She only wished she hadn’t taken them for granted. Macnair released her hair from his hold and stood up, leaving the room quietly. Molly wrapped her arms around her stomach and cried once more.

Molly cried out in pain as a contraction rippled through her body. Since last night the spasms running through the muscles of her stomach and back had increased in momentum, they came barely minutes apart now. She gripped the sheet beneath her and tried to blow air through her gritted teeth. Even after seven children, though her body was well versed and knew that to do, labor had not become any less painful. Finally, the muscles relaxed some and Molly was able to catch her breath. Narcissa sat at the edge of the bed watching Molly cautiously. It had been several years since Draco had been born, but she remembered the pain well. She had delivered at St. Mungo’s due to health complications which had ended with her unable to bear any more children.“Molly, are you sure that you are all right?” She asked, taking a cool washcloth from a basin on the nightstand and wiping it across Molly’s sweaty brow. Molly nodded, grimacing as she readjusted slightly on the bed.“I had all my children at home. This one feels no different than any of the eithers did. Thankfully there is only one this time, I thought the twins were going to kill me, the little bastards.” She chuckled a little, but it was cut off by a sharp hiss as another contraction swept through her. “I think it’s time, Narcissa.” She moaned, her hand clamping onto the side of her stomach. With Narcissa’s help, Molly heaved herself from the headboard and slid to the edge of the bed and lowered herself to her knees. Spreading them apart she leaned against the bed beside her and grit her teeth.“Why do you fall to your knees, Molly? What does this do to aid you?” Narcissa asked, helping Molly to hold her position as a contraction rippled through Molly, her legs trembling.“It allows gravity to bring the child down, rather than me needing to do all the work pushing.” Molly gasped, preparing for another one. At the start of the next contraction, Molly bared down with all her strength. A shift occurred, the pressure that had been weighing on her hips increased and began to push down, enhancing the burn between her legs. She moaned, twisting her fingers into the sheet she was clinging to. Her head dropped to rest against the bed when the contraction passed, gasping for air.“Molly, here. Take a drink.” Narcissa passed her a glass of water, helping her to sip from it. It helped to wet her dry mouth. Grunting her thanks, Molly pushed once more as pain tightened through her abdomen and back. She lost track of time as she kneeled there, struggling to bring her child out from the safety of her body and into the world. Hot flames of pain flared between Molly’s legs as she felt the child’s head pressing down and stretching Molly ever so slightly. With a shaking hand she reached down slowly, brushing her fingers against herself underneath the flowing skirt she wore. The tips of her fingers came into contact with the soft head of her child.“It’s crowning.” A whimper escaped her lips as another contraction pushed the child further from her body. Molly pushed with it, her hand coming to cup the head as bit by bit it emerged. Narcissa wiped the wet cloth over Molly’s forehead once more, her other hand running soothingly across her shoulders. Once more, Molly’s mind flashed back to when she had kneeled in this same position to bring her other children into the world. Arthur had stood beside her every time, rubbing soothing circles into her back as she pushed, muttering encouragements into her ear. Not for the last time, Molly’s heart broke as she thought of what she had lost.Another contraction brought the child’s head out of her, her hand resting between it and the floor beneath to protect it. Steeling herself for the next one, she stroked the head gently with the tip of her index finger. As pain tightened over Molly once more, she moaned out, bearing down. She felt the shoulders press sharply against her, the moan heightening to a guttural scream as her body opened more to let the child pass from it. Finally, one of the shoulders dislodged and the pain lessened by a fraction. Pushing herself up from her knees, she leaned over the edge of the bed to give herself enough room between her hips and the floor to catch her child when it fell from her. Taking a deep breath, she pushed once more, and with a loud cry the other shoulder came free. The child slid from her body and with a sigh of relief, Molly caught the body with her trembling hands. A strong cry arose from between her legs as she struggled to stand. Narcissa pulled Molly up by her arm and helped her to sit on the bed, as Molly pulled the crying child free from her long skirt. Finally, she disentangled the baby and laid eyes on it for the first time. The past year had been horrific, changing Molly for good, but at Narcissa’s next words a light seemed to appear.“You have a boy.” He was tiny, and he was perfect. His hair was dark, like Macnair’s, but his nose and eyes looked like hers. Narcissa warmed the water in the basin and began to gently clean the child as Molly held him close to her. He cried as the cloth ran over his skin but calmed when Molly whispered to him. Once clean, Narcissa severed the umbilical cord with a half-muttered spell Molly wasn’t paying enough attention to, to hear. Molly winced as a much smaller contraction brought her attention back to her surroundings. She pulled the hem of her shirt up to reveal her breast and drew her son to her nipple. At the scent of her milk, he nuzzled into her breast and rooted around for a moment, before finally latching to her. Her eyes traced the hard scar across her abdomen and across the breast her son now latched to. A tear fell down Molly’s cheek as he suckled gently. Narcissa placed her hand over Molly’s still-protruding abdomen and pressed down onto it. Molly grimaced as Narcissa massaged her abdomen, helping to dislodge the placenta still inside. She felt it come free from her and Narcissa gently pulled it from her.“Vulnera Sanentur.” Molly felt a soft ripple through her abdomen and between her legs as Narcissa healed the damage caused by the birth. Turning to the bed and floor beside it, she uttered, “Scourgify.” The blood that had soaked into the fabric, staining it, disappeared. The child at her breast let out a whine as the nipple slipped from his mouth, distressing him. Molly helped him back to it and relaxed into the headboard as she rested from her ordeal. The moment did not last long, however, as the door to the room was swung wide open. Macnair stood in its frame.“Narcissa, you may leave. My thanks, for helping to deliver my child.” Narcissa made no motion of acknowledgement towards Macnair as she left the room, closing the door behind her. He crossed the room towards Molly, his eyes on the child at her breast. “What is it, Molly?” The child, pressed against her tightly, hid itself from Macnair’s eyes.“A boy.” Macnair nodded approvingly, sitting down beside Molly.“Very good. A male heir on our first try, I am proud of you, Molly. Of course, he shall have my name. Walden Alatar Macnair II. A fine name, for a healthy son.” Molly bristled at the idea of this child bearing his name, but ultimately knew she had no power or say in the matter. “Any boys born; I shall name. If it is a girl, you can name the worthless bastards. Though, they may prove useful for unions in the future.” Molly’s stomach twisted at the idea of any daughters she bore here suffering the same fate she did. “Now, onto more pressing matters. I want to talk to you about the future, and what the expectations of you shall be.” Molly looked to her son sadly, his focusing on the innocence of his eyes. Blearily, he stared back up to her. Macnair’s eyes focused on the leather around Molly’s neck, a smile playing at the corner of his lips.“Of course, through our union, you became a part of my property, and as such, I decided what you are to do. And I want you to join the Death Eaters. The Dark Lord is gaining strength, and soon he shall return to a physical form.” Molly stared blankly at him. Join the Death Eaters? No. No was the answer, flat out. “Of course, you shall not be tasked with anything important, but you will be brought along on missions and kept in check by me, or by other Death Eaters who you are with. Whatever you are told to do, you will do it. Is that clear? If they tell you to torture someone, you do it. If I tell you to kill someone, you do it. Am I clear?” Molly started to shake her head, panic making it hard to think. But a heat spread across her right hand, the three flaming ropes appearing once more.“Yes, sir.” She hissed through her teeth. He may have commanded her to do as he said, but he never told her it had to be willing. Quickly, his hand darted forward and caught her sharply across her cheek.“Watch your tone with me, woman. It may be a command for you to take the follow orders, but you should be honored. I want absolutely no snide tones about it, and in the future I hope you will be much more enthusiastic about it.” The baby pulled away from her breast, wailing at the altercation that had occurred inches from him. Molly coddled him closer to her chest, patting his bottom gently in an attempt to soothe the startled child. “Now, Molly, I want you to understand. You do not have a choice about joining the Death Eaters. In a few months, when the time is right, you will be accepted into the ranks as an extension of me. You will perform accordingly. He may even be gracious enough to mark you as one of his own. It is a privilege, and you will be eager to do so.” Molly balked. Of the things she had expected when she was told she would be married to Macnair, bearing children was one. Taking the Dark Mark and being branded, and forced to participate, as a Death Eater had not been one. Molly cried, rocking her son softly as he closed his eyes and fell into sleep.“Walden, please. Do not force me to take the Mark, I do not want it.” It was barely a whisper. Macnair ignored her statement, wiping the tear from her cheek.“Why are you crying, Mollywobbles? Everything will be fine once this is over.” Anger flashed through her at the use of Arthur’s name. You absolute bastard. Once again, she had no choice. She would become a Death Eater. She will commit crimes against the very people she would’ve been standing with. She must do as she is commanded.“Yes, sir.” Her response was monotone, her will to fight gone. She was no longer Molly Weasley. Who she had been, had been dying since the day she was taken, and now, today, that last bit of her that was left was now gone. She shakily pulled herself to the edge of the bed and stood, limping over to the crib beneath the window. Carefully she clothed her son, laying him gently into the crib as not to wake him. I refuse to call him by your name. He shall have his own. Walter. Walter was a fine name for her son. Macnair left the room behind her, closing the door sharply. Not a moment later it re opened, and Nia tugged gently at her skirt.“Mistress Molly? Would you like some help to clean up?” She became aware of the feeling of cooled sweat on her body, and dried blood between her legs. Yes, she would need to clean herself. But first, her son would meet Nia.“In a moment, Nia. First, I want you to meet my son. His name is Walden, after his father, but I am going to call him Walter. You may do so as well if you would like.” Nia’s eyes glazed over as she looked down at the child.“I would be most honored, Mistress Molly.” Molly turned away from the crib and limped slowly into the bathroom, the pain from her birth radiating through her body. Nia followed behind her, collecting new clothes and things for Molly’s bath. Stepping into the tub that was filling with hot water, Molly began to scrub her body with soap. Molly thought of Arthur as she washed. If they ever made it out of here, would Arthur accept them? The idea of him claiming her son as his own placated the fear of what was to come. Yes. I know Arthur would love you, for the simple sake that you are mine. Walter deserved a real father, a man he could look to. A man he wouldn’t need to fear, a man who he could love and who would love him back. Molly hoped that one day, Walter would be able to meet Arthur. But she knew that what was to come was going to be awful; not just for her but for all of England. For all of the world, and that there was a high chance Walter would never know the man who should have been his father.She thought of Fabian and Gideon. How she had adored her older brothers. They had loved her and kept a relationship even after her parents disowned her for marrying Arthur. They had been amazing uncles, but having died when Percy was only four, the oldest three boys had very few and fuzzy memories of them, and the twins had no memories of the uncles they’d been named after. And now she lived in a manor with the man who had murdered them, and the men and women who fought and served for the man responsible for countless deaths. She rinsed the soap from her hair and stood, accepting the towel from Nia. While Molly began drying herself, Nia emptied the tub behind her and pulled together the clothes she had grabbed for Molly. She helped her into the loose-fitting dress that draped around her now empty stomach. Pulling a pair of underwear on she limped back out to the room and settled onto the bed. Exhausted, Molly fell into a deep sleep.She didn’t know how much time had passed since she fell asleep. Molly awoke, eyes heavy, and groggily came around. Walter. That’s what had awoken her. He was crying softly. Molly made her way over to him, legs uneasy as his cries grew louder. Collecting the tiny babe from the crib, she brought him over to the bed with her. Changing him, she set the dirty cloth diaper to the side and put a clean one on. Picking her wand up from the bedside table, she muttered, “Scourgify.” The mess disappeared from the cloth, and Molly set it aside to run through the wash. Sitting against the headboard she pulled the hem of the dress up and brought Walter to her breast. Quicker this time, he latched to her breast and suckled. Molly drew patterns on his arm as he fed, humming a song her mother had hummed to her when she was a child, and she had hummed to all her children. A knock on the door pulled Molly’s attention away from her son. Narcissa entered, closing the door behind her.“How are you feeling?” She asked, sitting down beside Molly. She watched the baby for a moment, listening to his little huffs as he drank.“Sore, but much better. Bathed and slept some, before he woke me up for a change and feeding.” Walter coughed, the nipple slipping from his grip. Molly pulled him away for a moment, patting his back until his throat was cleared. She placed him back to her and he continued feeding.“What name was chosen?” Molly stiffened.“He named him after himself. Walden Alatar Macnair. But I am going to call him Walter.” Narcissa nodded understandingly.“Lucius named Draco. It is common among Purebloods. The father’s name the sons, the mother’s may sometimes get to choose for their daughters. Not always, though.” Molly shook her head softly.“Arthur and I always chose our names together. If one of us didn’t care for it, we would move on and think of another.”“The more I hear of Arthur, the more of a man he becomes. I am sorry that fate turned out the way it did. If I had been wiser, I would have followed Andromeda’s steps and married someone I loved. Maybe then, I would not be trapped here. We might have even been friends, you and I.” Molly laughed.“Narcissa, honestly, I do see you as my friend. You are the only one who has been kind to me here, aside from Nia. Even if it was out of convenience for you, it has been of comfort to me. I thank you for that.” Narcissa smiled back at Molly.“What troubles you, Molly? I can see a darkness hiding in your eyes.” Molly looked away from Narcissa.“Walden told me that he wants me to join the Death Eaters. And I don’t have a choice, I took the Unbreakable Vow to obey him. He is going to make me do awful things. Torture, he said. Murder. And I can’t. I can’t do that.” Molly held her son tighter to her chest. He had stopped feeding and fallen back to sleep. She lowered the dress back to cover herself.“Yes, Molly, you can, and you will. Because of him. Because of the rest of your family. You made the vow to protect them. You will do things you think inhuman in order to keep them safe. Trust me.” Molly knew she was right. Narcissa herself, unsympathetic to You-Know-Who, had given herself up to keep Draco safe. “Lucius has commanded me to take the Dark Mark soon. And I will, to keep Draco safe from it as long as I can. He is still only a child.”“Walden told me that one day I will take the Mark as well, but I do not believe it is going to be soon. Maybe a year down the road, give or take, based off of what Walden told me. I dread it immensely, Narcissa.” A simple nod of understanding was all Molly received from the younger woman. In every way, Narcissa was just as trapped as Molly. The idea that she wasn’t alone, however, did bring a sense of relief to Molly. Standing, careful not to wake the child in her arms, Molly carried Walter back to the crib and laid him down gently.“I want you to promise me something, Narcissa.” She kept her back to the other woman, her eyes focused on the child below her. The setting sun lit up the window above him.“What, Molly?”“If something is to happen to me. If I were to die, please, watch over my son. Don’t leave Walden to be the only person guiding him. I want him to have the chance to know good. To be good. Please?” Narcissa stood behind her and walked to stand beside Molly.“I will do everything I can to help protect him, I swear. I don’t know how much I can do, but I won’t stop trying, Molly. I promise.” Molly couldn’t ask for anymore than that.“Thank you, Narcissa. Thank you.” Her eyes never left the baby before her.

Molly held the crying infant to her shoulder, patting his back gently. Finally, he burped the gas bubble that had been hurting him since he had fed. Tucking Walter gently into her arms, Molly pocketed her wand and left her room, seeking Narcissa. Limping down the hallway Molly sought the drawing room, where Narcissa had told her she would be today, mending robes for the Death Eaters. Finally reaching the room she stepped in, stopping dead. Narcissa was not alone in the drawing room. Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape stood in the corner, talking. Upon her arrival their conversation halted, and Snape took a double glance towards Molly. Cutting the conversation short he turned back towards the door frame she still stood beneath. Stepping away from Lucius, he looked Molly over, his eyes stopping on the child in her arms.“So, this is where Molly Weasley has been. Your disappearance has caused quite a stir among the wizarding community. Unfortunately, it seems, it will only be the first of what is going to be many. And whose child do you carry in your arms?” His voice was quiet, a cold and calculated drawl. Only the brief look of surprise in his eyes had given him away. Molly weighed her options but saw no benefit to keeping information from Snape. In the end, there was nothing to lose or gain from being honest about her situation.“Walden Macnair. He took me and forced me into marriage. This is his heir.” The words were bitter as they left Molly’s mouth. Lucius, bored of where the conversation had gone, walked past them towards the hall.“Another time, perhaps,” he threw over his shoulder, passing out of sight. Snape’s eyes travelled over Molly, cataloging her visible injuries. The dress she wore today was low cut across the breasts, showing a good portion of the scar there. The scar trailing from her shoulder to her wrist fully visible, dark, and raised from the pale skin around it. Bruises littered her arms and visible portions of her legs, remnants of her nights in bed with Macnair. Her knee, visible below the bottom hem of her dress, was twisted to the side a little as if it had been poorly healed after a bad break. Snape doubted it was accidental. Narcissa was watching the interaction through the corner of her eye as she darned a robe.“What makes you stay? Is a witch unable to make her own decisions? What keeps you here, when you seem to prefer the idea of returning to your muggle loving husband.” Molly snorted, sitting onto the couch, and settling Walter onto her lap. She thought for a moment as how to best let this bastard know that choice wasn’t a luxury for her.“Because I made an Unbreakable Vow, Severus. I vowed I would never try to leave, or ask for help in leaving, and do everything he tells me to, so long as he doesn’t hurt my family. It was the only way I could protect them; he would have gone after them if I didn’t.” Snape grit his teeth at this. Despite serving as a spy for Dumbledore, he did truly hate innocents being punished. His eyes had been opened to the awful crimes he had commit during the last war, when he had switched sides. He would spend the rest of his life atoning for what he had done; both to Lily and to the countless others he had hurt and killed in service of the Dark Lord. Now, seeing the wife of Arthur here, caused him great anger. Arthur had been spending much of his time carrying out missions for Dumbledore since the disappearance of his wife, while his children were at school. There was no doubt in his mind that Arthur would be a founding member of the Order once it reformed.“I am deeply sorry to hear of this, Molly. I wish you the best.” Molly stared at Severus in disbelief. Here she sat before him, locked in a house, married to a man who had been raping her, and allowing others to torture her. Forcing her to bear a child, and to join a group of Dark wizards, and all he had to say to her was I’m sorry, and good luck? Narcissa’s hand hesitated over the robe she was patching, watching Molly’s face. In truth, Snape was furious at the condition of Molly before him. His eyes lingered on her bruised cheek and black eye as he thought of all the curses he could use on Macnair. Would use, as well, if it would not have blown his cover. One day, Walden Macnair deserved to know great pain for what he had done to this woman. Snape didn’t know how he would face Arthur, how he could face her children at Hogwarts, after seeing her here today. He swallowed the response he wanted to give her so fiercely. No, there was nothing he could do to help Molly at this time. He would have to let this play out.“I wish there was more I could do for you, Molly. I swear. Here, allow me to heal your wounds. Episkey.” Despite her anger towards Snape, Molly sighed in relief as the soreness in her muscles dissipated, the bruises that covered her clearing. “I will brew large batches of healing potions and have them sent to you. Use them, whenever they are needed. And I will send some sleeping droughts as well, for bad nights.” He glanced down to the child in her arms, his expression guarded well. Without another word, only a swish of his robes, Snape turned and left the room.“Well, all in all, that could have gone much worse.” Narcissa finished the robe she was working on and packed the rest away for later.  Molly grunted noncommittally in response, readjusting Walter in her arms. He began to fuss, crying out as he nestled his face toward her breast. Molly pulled her shirt down and fed him, rocking the both of them back and forth gently as she hummed. Once he had finished, Molly pat his back gently to help burp him. Narcissa was making her way towards Molly to sit beside her when the drawing room door slammed open, revealing Bellatrix. Molly clutched Walter closer to her.“Come, blood traitor. We need to have a discussion. And leave that filthy creature behind.” Molly looked to Narcissa for help, but the other woman simply shook her head. Reaching out, Narcissa took the baby from Molly’s arms and cradled him gently, allowing Molly to stand and limp heavily out of the room after Bellatrix. Down a flight of stairs, she hobbled after the other woman, who laughed at Molly’s struggle to keep up. To the cellar she was led, a cell door behind her closing. The only light was that which filtered through the bars. Concrete, colorless and cold, rose around her to support the manor above. Darkness swept forward from the unseen depths in front of her.“Bellatrix, what is it that you have brought me down here f-”“Crucio!” Molly let out a shriek, falling to the cold floor beneath her. No matter how many times this spell was used upon her it never became any more tolerable. She flailed for a moment before Bellatrix lifted the spell off of her. “What, can’t take a little pain, traitor?” She cackled, dancing around Molly’s crumpled form. Molly cried out as Bellatrix’s foot struck her firmly in her stomach, leaving her gasping raggedly for air. “So, you have been offered the opportunity to take the Dark Mark, an honor well above you, filthy whore, and yet here you stand as if on higher ground and denying it. You are not worthy of it, but Macnair has chosen for you to take it. And he has asked me to remove any dissension that resides in you through any means I see fit, so long as you live. Oh, the fun we will have together!” She crooned, kicking Molly once more. “However, Rodolphus and I differ in one,” Bellatrix caught herself, letting out a laugh. “Well, many ways, but here, no, here we both love torture. But where he takes enjoyment in filthy muggle methods, I have a high appreciation for magic. We are better, higher, after all than those muggle bastards.” Bellatrix tangled her fingers into Molly’s hair, pulling her torso off of the ground. Molly cried out, attempting to find some purchase on the ground with her hands in order to support her weight.“Crucio!” Molly dropped to the floor once more as Bellatrix released her grip. The sound of her screams echoed through the cellar, amplified by the empty walls rebounding louder and louder to Molly’s ears. Time seemed unending, but at the same time non-existent as Molly thrashed on the floor. Finally, Bellatrix released the spell. Molly slumped against the concrete, the feeling of the freezing water she lay in almost a comfort after the fire that had coursed through her body moments before.“P- Please, Bellatrix… No.. No more.” She felt she had no control over the plea that escaped her lips, it was simply a response from her body to the insurmountable pain she was in. Bellatrix merely laughed, cold and cruel. Molly’s eyes unfocused as she drew in ragged breaths. Alice Longbottom came to mind, maybe unsurprisingly given the circumstances, but confounding Molly all the same. She wondered if it had been like this for her, too, as she and her husband had been tortured. How long had they held out, refusing to give information away, before their minds had broken? Molly knew, she had seen them before at St. Mungo’s. Her heart broke for them; for the life they had lost, for the child who had grown up without his parents knowing who he was. Without knowing who they were. How long can I suffer this before I end up the same as them? Changed, forever broken? Molly wasn’t sure she wanted to know the answer.“Crucio!” Molly tensed, shrieking again as white-hot pain electricity burned through her. As she thrashed, vaguely she was aware of blows to her body and laughter. Something snapped at the back of Molly’s mind, her thrashing died down to convulsions as her body grew weaker. Bellatrix removed the curse once more. Her fingers tangled in the leather collar around Molly’s neck, pulling her head harshly from the floor.“Stronger than I thought you’d be. Figured you would’ve broken before now, traitor. Anyway, it’s been fun. When you go before the Dark Lord, you will be honored. You shall show him respect. You shall bear the Dark Mark with pride. If not, we shall meet again under these circumstances. And part of me hopes we do because the sounds of your screams are delicious.” Receiving no reaction from Molly, she released the collar and watched the woman fall, before Bellatrix’s leg struck out into her abdomen one last time before she turned on her heel and stalked out of the cellar. The metal door clanged into the cobbled wall, Bellatrix’s laughter ringing out behind her as she climbed the staircase, her heels clicking with every step. Molly let out the breath she had been holding, a sob escaping her. Her throat was raw, the noises that managed to escape were broken and raspy. The sound of another set of footsteps reached Molly, and as best as she could manage, she pulled herself tightly into herself. Please, no more. I can’t take any more. Terror built in Molly as the steps grew louder, coming down the staircase behind her. It consumed her. Her mind went white as she struggled to mover her body, but her muscles were too weak to respond to her. I am going to die. Surprisingly, however, this thought brought some peace with it rather than adding to her panic. If she died, there would be no more of this. It would all simply be... Gone. Molly flinched as the steps stalled beside her, preparing for the next blow. It never came. Instead, soft hands wrapped around Molly and helped sit her up slightly, slowing when Molly cried out. Narcissa sat above her, offering a cup with a deep red liquid in it. Healing potion. Apparently, Snape had followed through on his promise, and quickly. Molly drank the potion slowly, sighing as some of the pain in her body dissipated. Gently Narcissa helped Molly to her feet and led her up the stairs, stopping every time Molly slowed. It took them a while to reach the room she shared with Macnair. He sat on their bed, watching their progress with disdain.“Thank you, Narcissa. You may leave. And take the child for a while, I want some alone time with Molly.” Narcissa nodded, depositing Molly onto the bed beside Macnair and collected Walter from his crib, shutting the door softly behind her. Macnair shifted his body towards Molly who was laying on the bed, too weak to sit up. His hand reached forward, settling onto her thigh. “How was your time with Bellatrix? We could hear your screams throughout the manor, they were thrilling.” Molly shuddered as his hand stroked up and down her thigh, squeezing. A weight settled over her chest as the will to fight died in her. Macnair pulled her body to the center of the bed, undressing the both of them as he stroked himself. Nudging her knees apart with one of his own he climbed her body, biting up her torso, breast, shoulder, neck. Stopping only to claim her lips in a rough kiss. Molly didn’t make a single noise, only a tear slipping from the corner of her eye revealing herself.“Perfect, my Mollywobbles.” She closed her eyes as Macnair pushed into her, his fingers digging into her waist, bruising the soft flesh. She tried to imagine that it was Arthur above her, making love to her, and not this man. But the two were far too different. Arthur had always, even in the midst of a hormone driven shag, managed to be infuriatingly gentle with her. Always made her feel loved. But Macnair was forceful, his harsh thrusts left Molly in pain as he pushed himself harder, faster, into her, seeking his release. Arthur had left hickeys and gentle nips covering her body, ones she would have to cover up for the sake of her older children. Macnair left awful bruises splotched across her, sharp teeth marks where he bit into her skin. Arthur would drive her wild, pushing her to dizzying heights and earth-shattering orgasms. Macnair only used her to pleasure himself. Molly was not too upset by this, the idea of him bringing her to an orgasm disgusted her to no end. Arthur would hold her after they finished, coming down together as he kissed her body softly, whispering adorations to her. Macnair rolled over and fell asleep moments after jack hammering deep within her body, spilling himself into her while keening like a wounded animal. Merlin, how she missed the feeling of Arthur’s arms around her, the sound of his pleasure as they moved together. She missed the way he stuttered her name as he approached his climax, words barely serving him as he clutched to her body. She missed the way he would almost chant her name after he finished as if it were a prayer. And Merlin, she missed the way he would look at her when they were done, as if she had hung the moon and stars. She began to cry as Macnair pushed her legs further apart, opening herself to him even more. Her hips ached at the angle which she was held in place, finger shaped bruises forming under her knees where he was pushing down. His moans turned Molly’s stomach. Please, just let this end. He stalled for a moment, sitting still inside of Molly as he watched her expression. Frustration built in his eyes as she refused to respond.“Like I said, Molly, I hoped one day you would come to enjoy this with me. However, you seem resigned to it being a horrible experience for you. Let’s see if I can change that. One day, when you think of pleasure, you will be thinking of me and not that blood traitor you let defile you.” Molly furrowed her brows slightly but said nothing as Macnair resumed his pace inside of her. What did cause her to respond, however, was the feeling of spit-slick fingers trailing over the spot where their bodies came together. Revulsion colored Molly as he began to rub her, and the slow response her body began to give. Her nerves came to life as pleasure began to dampen the friction pain, her body accommodating him better as she produced lubricant of her own. Hatred and lust battled, building higher in her as he continued to thrust into her at a rapid pace. Molly knew she wasn’t responsible for the reaction her body was giving, that they were made to respond this way, but she couldn’t help to despise herself for reacting to it. Disgust and shame burned though Molly as her orgasm crashed over her. A moaned cry escaped her lips as her body tensed, her muscles clamping and contracting around Macnair as she tried to breath through it. Spasming shudders ran through her as Macnair continued to rut into her over sensitized body drawing rasping gasps from Molly. He came to a halt above her, pushing deeply in as he spilled his seed into her body. His grip finally loosened as he rolled off of Molly, pulling himself out and collapsing onto the bed beside her. He was asleep within minutes. Molly fought the urge to sob again. The idea that anyone could accept her back after what had occurred was becoming more laughable to Molly with every day passing. How could her husband want her back when she had been so thoroughly violated? How could she promise to protect her children when she had failed so miserably to protect herself? It took Molly much longer for the thoughts racing through her mind to settle enough for her to fall into a troubled asleep.

Molly cooed at Walter, setting him down on the floor to play some after his morning feeding. Despite the circumstances that had led the both of them here, she could not harbor any resentment for her son. His hair had remained dark, an imitation of his father’s. But his eye shape was hers, similar to so many of his siblings. Even a spatter of light freckles had bloomed across his nose. His eyes had remained blue, like Walden’s, but they didn’t hold the cold apathy his did. Instead, they had a lightness that reminded her dearly of Arthur’s eyes. Narcissa entered the room with two plates of food and settled them onto the table beside the couch.“Come, Molly. Eat, its late and I haven’t seen you near the table today.” Molly sat beside Narcissa on the couch, accepting the plate of food from her gratefully. They watched Walter play with wooden blocks Narcissa had given her, hand-me-downs from Draco’s closet. She emptied her plate quietly, setting it back onto the table next to her. Her eyes trailed on Narcissa’s arm as she set her plate atop Molly’s, her sleeve raising on her left forearm which now bore the Dark Mark. She caught Molly’s eyes out of the corner of her own and sighed. She tugged the edge of her sleeve back down, fidgeting with the silk hem. “I didn’t want it. But I wasn’t brave enough to tell Lucius that. To tell anyone, really. Besides you.” She fell silent, nails turning to picking at the stitching.“And what bloody good would that have done? Telling anyone else here you didn’t want to take it? All it got me was tortured, and I can promise you, Narcissa, it didn’t feel very good. Macnair has hinted that the time is drawing closer, and I dread it, but I am not going to make the mistake of voicing my disgust for it again. What Bellatrix did to me was excruciating. And Macnair wasn’t all too gentle with me that night either. There is no point in harboring bitterness over it. All we can do it accept it.” No matter how much we hate it. Molly looked down to Walter, continuing to play completely unperturbed by the conversation around him. Molly’s mind strayed to her children. Their year at Hogwarts would be ending in a few days’ time, apart from the older three who had left school behind them. She had missed Percy’s final year and venture into the adult world. The deepening swell of depression reared itself through her chest, coursing cold and tight. There was much more to come that she would miss, she knew. But it didn’t diminish the things she felt now. She was absent from their lives, and she missed them dearly. As far as she knew her other two sons were safe, far away in countries she hadn’t cared for them living in, so long from home. But now she couldn’t be more thankful for the distance between them. No doubt if things went bad and Wizarding Britain fell to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named then mainland Europe would soon follow, and that spelled disaster for magic folk and muggles alike. She doubted the non-magical community would fair nearly as well as their wizard counterparts. If Europe fell it would be a domino affect throughout the world. She only hoped that the international wizarding community could band together and mount a defense. She was pulled from her thoughts as Lucius burst into the drawing room.“Lucius, what is it?” Narcissa inquired, moving to his side. Molly made her way to Walter and pulled him up from the floor, seating him onto her hip. Lucius looked nothing like Molly had ever seen; unsure and almost unnerved. His eyes were bloodshot, hair unwashed. His gaze darted around the room uncertainly for a moment, hesitating on Molly before he looked back to Narcissa. He began to whisper to her, almost too low and rushed for Molly to hear. Almost.“Sirius Black was captured at Hogwarts. Everything was going according to plan. Then that Potter ruined it. The stupid Lycan shifted, nearly killed them both. Every problem we had would have been solved.” Molly felt a swell of pride at the idea that Harry had thwarted their plans, however small. And from what Lucius was saying, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black had both survived. She had overheard Draco at winter break, disdainfully talking about the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and remembered him from her brothers’ time in the Order. He had been kind. And Sirius, who she knew now was innocent of the crimes the world knew him for. Lucius’ voice rose, drawing her back into the whispered conversation. She looked down to Walter, focusing on the voice to her left. “That damned fool, Pettigrew. He’s coming back. Sirius escaped, but Pettigrew was discovered and is returning soon. Bastard was an Animagus, he’s been hiding as rat all these years. Sardonic if I say so myself. Unfortunately, he is in the Dark Lord’s favor so we must prepare for him, he should arrive today. Soon, if I am not mistaken.” He broke away from Narcissa and turned to leave, his eyes flashing back towards Molly. She glanced up at him, cowering at the look of anger in his eyes. “Stay out of my way, blood traitor.” Molly stumbled back a few steps, diverting her eyes from his. In the time she had been here, she wouldn’t recognize herself. Gone was the domineering spitfire she had been in her younger days. No, now she was submissive and terrified, always backing down from confrontation. She wrapped her arms around Walter just a little tighter, turning to shield him from Lucius.“Yes sir.” It was barely a whisper, but her response seemed to appease him. He turned and stalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. The noise startled the child on her hip, his cry filling the silence left behind from Lucius’ exit. Molly hushed her son, attempting to calm him as Narcissa shook her head at the closed door.“I am sorry, Molly. About what he said to you.” Molly waved her off, patting her sons back gently. Truthfully, her heart was pounding at what he could have done to her, but it didn’t matter now. He was gone, for the time being. Walter’s cries calmed and he hugged onto Molly’s arm tightly, resting his head.“May I borrow your house elf for a little while, to prepare a room for Pettigrew?” Molly nodded, following Narcissa out of the room. A voice down the hall caught her attention.“Molly, come here. Now.” She turned and made her way towards Macnair who stood at the end of the hall. Beside him stood a short, rotund man with bulbous eyes. They had a manic look to them, as his gaze flicked around every surface of the hallway about them. Pettigrew. She stopped before them, turning herself towards Macnair. He reached out for Walter, and hesitantly Molly held her son out to him. He looked him over carefully, his eyes remaining on Walter’s, the same icy blue as his own. Content with his inspection of his son, he handed the child back to Molly. “He is looking finer every day; I can now see some of my features in his face. Anyway, Molly, this is Pettigrew. He is responsible for the downfall of the Potter’s.” Molly looked towards Pettigrew, unease building in her. His eyes were raking over her body, a smile playing at the corner of his lips. Unease built in Molly as his grin widened.“It is a pleasure to see you again, Molly.” She stepped back, looking reproachfully towards the man before her. “Ah, yes, you wouldn’t recognize me, would you? After all, you haven’t seen me like this in over ten years. I have, however, been close by. I have been in hiding for the last twelve years, within your own home. I am an Animagus you see.” Molly recalled what Lucius had told Narcissa. He had been living as a rat all these years. Cold realization dawned on her.“You don’t mean-”“Oh, I was grateful for the nice warm home you provided me during that time, I promise! And easy access to news in the wizarding world, too.” Molly’s stomach flipped. For the last twelve years this man had been living in her home, cared for by her children. Molly balked and pulled away from Pettigrew. He let out a rasping laugh and turned from them, leaving down a staircase just up the hall. She had no time to process this, however, as Macnair grabbed her arm.“Molly, I want you to give Walden to Narcissa. We have somewhere to be.” Narcissa had stayed back, waiting for Molly. At Macnair’s words she approached them and took Walter from her. “Good. Thank you, Narcissa. Come, Molly. It is time you meet the Dark Lord. Lucius and Avery brought him back earlier. They have revived his mortal form with a rudimentary body potion. He will look… Unsettling. But you will not mention it, do you hear me?” Molly and Narcissa both froze, looking at one another. Molly could tell this was news to the other woman, same as her.“Yes sir.” Molly answered, moving to place herself beside him. Narcissa collected the child more securely into her arms and left the two of them in the hallway. Macnair beckoned Molly to follow, and she limped slowly along behind him. Painfully, the climbed two flights of stairs to the top floor, down to a room she had never seen. Macnair knocked softly and waited, before the door opened. In its frame stood a tall, slender man. His face was unshaven and grimy, dark shadows circled his eyes. His eyes fell on Molly, looking her up and down with a twisted smile. His tongue flicked out some, wetting his lip.“Come on in, Walden. He has been expecting you.”“Thank you, Barty.” The man stepped back, opening the door enough for them to enter. Molly stumbled in after Macnair, hoping to keep her distance from the man behind her. She knew his name, Barty Crouch Jr. He had been with Bellatrix when the Longbottom’s had been tortured. A chair sat in the room, facing away from them and towards a lit fireplace. Slowly they made their way around the chair, towards the occupant. Molly had to catch herself before the audible gasp left her mouth. Before them in the chair, sat something she would not describe as being human. He was grotesquely deformed, his hands and feet much too large for the child sized body. Thankfully he was wrapped in a blanket, but his face was fully visible as he turned to look at them. He had no nose, just two slits that reminded Molly of a snake she had seen when Arthur had dragged her to a muggle zoo years before. And his eyes. They were crimson, boring deeply into her, almost as of he could read her through and through.“Alas, Macnair, it is good to see you again.” His voice was quiet, his speaking slowed. It seemed to take great effort for him to simply speak. “I must thank you for your faithful work all these years, hidden deep. It was a wise move to interweave yourself within the ministry, even if you lied and said I forced you to join me.” There was a tone of annoyance, but he waved it off. “For that, you were rewarded with this blood traitor. Lucius tells me that you have requested her to take my mark. That is an honor reserved only for my most devoted followers, yourself being one. Tell me why I should grant your request for this blood traitor.” Molly remained quiet, shrinking back against the wall behind her.“Master, I ask this as a favor to me. To completely bind her to myself, and therefore, you. She has joined me in marriage, produced an heir. Cleansed her blood traitor status. She has made an Unbreakable Vow to obey and serve me, and any I command her to. Meaning you as well, My Lord. Complete control, at the expense of death. What more could you ask for?” The deformed man in the chair let out a humored laugh, looking once more towards Molly.“He makes a compelling case, does he not? Even I find myself swayed by it. By the look of the collar on your neck, I would say that you are very well handled by him if you haven’t attempted to take it off even once, I see no scratch marks on its exterior. Very well, Macnair, yes. Not today, however. No, there is much to do today. Soon I shall be moved to another place, for safekeeping. You will come to me then, and we shall do as you have asked me. Yes, Molly, you shall take the mark soon. And you shall be one of us. That means, however, that you will obey any tasks given to you. Am I clear?” Molly nodded stiffly.“Yes sir. Completely clear.”“You will address me as My Lord, or the Dark Lord only.”"Y… Yes, My Lord.” The words nearly choked her on the way out, his sadistic grin angered her.“Well done, my servant. Bound to me by punishment of death. Yes, you shall do well here. You may leave me now.” Macnair nodded and bowed lowly before him. With a flick of his wand, Molly was forced into the same low bow, painfully so.“You will bow before the Dark Lord, Molly. And thank him, for his graciousness towards you.”“Yes sir, I am sorry. Thank you, My Lord.” Bile crept up Molly’s throat. Swallowing hard, she followed Macnair from the room stiffly. Through the halls of the manor, she limped. On the second story landing Macnair turned and grabbed her arm tightly, pulling her close to him.“Brilliant, Molly. Worry not about the awkwardness, ease will come in time. Soon you shall take his mark and be one of us, wholly. I am proud of you, Molly.” He pulled her in, kissing her roughly. The hair of his beard scratched, irritating the skin around Molly’s lips. Her stomach clenched uncomfortably as he deepened the kiss, his fingers bruising her upper arm. Relief flooded through her body as he pulled away, smiling at her. “I have to go, business to attend to. Relax, go take care of our son. I will see you tonight, Mollywobbles.” He left her there, walking briskly away from her, turning the corner out of sight. Molly turned the other way back towards her room. Her knee was bothering her today, the repeated tracks up and down stairs agitated the damaged joint. It was stiff, hot, and swollen. Finally, she made it back to her room, the sight of Narcissa standing over the crib watching her son greeting her. Narcissa turned to look at her, fingers to her lips. Both women made their way to the bed, sitting softly on the quilt.“He just fell asleep a few minutes ago. So, how did it go?” Everything Molly had been trying to ignore came flooding back, tears filling her eyes. She forced herself to sob quietly, not wanting to wake Walter from his nap. Narcissa reached out gently, pulling Molly in to cry on her shoulder. Her hand caressed Molly’s hair softly as she tried to comfort her. Her sobs stilled after a few minutes, the tears still falling down her cheeks.“He accepted Walden’s request. I will take the mark soon, and I will be a Death Eater.” Narcissa resumed her stroking of Molly’s hair, knowing there was nothing she could say to assuage the other woman’s despair.“I am so very sorry you were pulled into all of this, Molly.” She could hear the frustration in Narcissa’s tone and let out a humorless chuckle.“Not like either of us had much of a choice there.” Narcissa hummed in agreement as Molly slowly pulled herself away, wiping her eyes. “Thank you, Narcissa. For everything.” Narcissa simply nodded, squeezing the Molly’s hand next to her on the bed. Silence lay heavy between them as Molly’s breathing slowed. She broke the silence with a question, one she doubted she wanted to actually know the answer to.“Did it hurt?” Narcissa looked towards her, thinking of the easiest response she could give. Molly didn’t need an easy answer, she knew that, but it hurt all the same to give her an honest one.“It is painful. It burns, and not just in your forearm. It lights your nerves on fire, all the way up your arm. Though the pain fades, it does not diminish quickly. My arm hurt the rest of the day after I received my mark. To wear long sleeves was unbearable.” Molly nodded at her response, less than thrilled about the idea.“How does it work? Him giving it to you.” Narcissa laughed softly, pulling the hem of her dress to the side, allowing her to shift her legs.“He modified the Protean Charm. Allowing it to work on the human body, as a mark on the skin. When someone presses it with their finger, the others can feel it. He uses it to call us to him. Since I received my mark, I have only felt a single call, but it was painful. The mark darkened, and it burned terribly, the same as it did when I received it.” She drew her sleeve up, revealing the mark. Molly knew it well, having seen it on Walden’s arm nearly every night for almost the last two years. That thought stopped her momentarily, the breath catching in her lungs. Nearly two years. Her focus was drawn back to Narcissa, whose finger was tracing just above the mark on her arm, following the snake twisted around itself and back up to the skull from which it the snake protruded from. “Is there anything else you would like to know, Molly?”“No, Narcissa. Thank you, though. For everything.” Narcissa nodded, standing up from the bed and making her way quietly towards the door.“I’ll see you soon. Rest, while Walter is. You look like you need it.” She left her there, closing the door softly behind her. Molly pulled the quilt back and slid underneath it, pulling it back up tightly around her. Sleep was elusive, but finally, finally, Molly fell into an uneasy sleep.

Molly shifted the cloak around her tightly, in attempt to block the strong wind that assailed her. She was following Macnair down the front lawns of the Malfoy Estate, the gravel crunching underneath her feet. Macnair was several steps ahead of her, her limp holding her back a little as she pushed herself forward. She caught up to him at the gates, which swept up well above their heads with the Malfoy family crest dominating the center. She saw nowhere that the gates would part, allowing them through. She turned to look at Macnair, awaiting instruction.“This gate has a ward over it, only those who bear the Dark Mark, or are escorted by them, may enter. Come, Molly.” He grabbed ahold of her right hand and pulled her forward, towards the wrought iron bars of the gate. He stepped forward, the metal dissolving into thick black smoke allowing him to pass. He pulled Molly along behind him, the smoke passing over her harmlessly as she walked through. She turned around as the last tendrils of smoke left her cloak, to watch the metal gate rematerialize behind them, looking as solid as ever. He released her hand, waving towards the gate. “Try, now.” She reached out slowly, her fingers meeting the cool metal before her. It remained firm. Pulling her hand back she turned back towards Macnair, following him a little way down the path from the gate. By the hedge he stopped, waiting for her to catch up.“We are going to apparate to him, Molly. Come here and take my arm.” She did as he said, locking their elbows together and wrapping her arm around his own. She felt a sharp pull behind her navel and closed her eyes as the world around them twisted violently, winking out of sight. Finally, she felt solid ground beneath her again and opened her eyes slowly, hoping the spinning had stopped. Apparation had always turned her stomach in a way she could not understand, as floo travel had never done so and was nearly identical. Shaking her head she opened her eyes, looking at the scenery around them. The night that surrounded them now was cooler than the one they had left moments before. So, they had come north. Before them stood what once was a grand mansion but now, lay in ruin. Boards covered windows and the sun had long ago cracked the paint on the walls before them. Down the road below them, she could see a little village with lights twinkling in the growing twilight around them.“Where are we, Walden?” Molly asked, falling into step behind him as he made his way up the dirt path to the decrepit manor. He helped pull her up a small ledge, turning back to the path before them.“That village down there is Little Hangleton. We are approaching the old Riddle house, birthplace and home of Tom Riddle Senior, father of the Dark Lord. You will not mention this home, village, or anything to do with his lineage, do you understand me?” His voice held no anger, only a simple warning. Molly nodded her understanding, but why would she mention that anyway? She knew almost nothing about this manor, or the village it sat above, and surely she knew nothing of the lineage of the Dark Lord. Sure, he was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, that much had been made clear to her, but of his father she knew nothing. That seemed to be the great shame in itself, maybe there was good reason they spoke not of his father. They made their way up the overgrown dirt path to the manor and made their way around to the back door which stood somewhat open. Footprints disturbed the dust that had accumulated into a thick layer on the hard wood floors of the back hallway. They followed them up the stairs, winding their way through the house. By the second landing, they could hear voices muttering from a room nearby, and shallow light filtered through the air around them, illuminating millions of dust specks suspended. A loud cry halted both of them in their steps.“Avada Kedavra!” Both heads turned to look at each other, before Macnair took off running up the staircase. Molly made her way more slowly, listening as Macnair called out to the others in the house. Finally reaching the landing, Molly held herself up on the banister and rested for a moment, her knee aching. Macnair returned to her line of sight, coming out of the room which the light was pooling from. Behind him followed Crouch, who wore a smile that disturbed Molly.“Come along, Molly. The Dark Lord is awaiting us.” Molly followed Macnair into the room, Crouch falling into step behind her. She stopped on the threshold of the room, her hand flying to cover her mouth as she registered the body on the floor. An elderly man lay sprawled before them, a look of terror etched into his face. Macnair pulled her by the arm, stepping around the body and to the other side of the room. Sat in the same chair, in front of another fireplace sat the Dark Lord, watching the flames dance in the hearth.“I am sorry for that unpleasantness back there, especially for such a lady as yourself. The old muggle caretaker just couldn’t keep to himself and had to come looking where he was not welcome. Thankfully, Nagini noticed him hiding in the hall outside and brought his presence to our attention. He had heard too much of our plans, and well, we couldn’t have that, could we?” A high, cold laugh escaped him, and Molly stepped back in terror as a large snake slithered out from the blanket wrapped around him, thudding to the floor below and winding her way around the chair legs and back out into the hall. “Now, Molly, it is time for you to take my mark, is it not? Unfortunately, at this time I am unable to perform the necessary magic to complete this request, but thankfully, Mr. Crouch back there has done well to master my modified Protean Charm. He shall be the one to mark you today. Come, Crouch.” Crouch made his way around the chair and stood before Molly, grabbing her wrist painfully and pulling her arm towards him.“Now, the fun begins.” He turned her hand so that the inside of her forearm stood flat, facing him, and he lowered his wand to the skin. Molly’s hands were shaking as he dragged his wand tip around her arm, contemplating. Finally, he settled on a spot in the center of her arm and whispered a word so low she couldn’t hear it. Not that she would have been able to focus on it, anyways. A horrific burn settled over her arm, fire licking up to her shoulder and igniting her fingertips. Molly screamed, but Crouch held her arm in place tightly as he finished the spell. Darkness bloomed over Molly’s forearm, coalescing into a terrible image. A skull now stood on her forearm, and from its mouth emerged a snake, turning and twisting itself into knots. A tear fell down Molly’s cheek, but she bit back the sob that threatened to escape, refusing to show this weakness in front of them. Crouch dropped her arm and pocketed his wand, leaving the two of them under the window. Molly’s fingers drifted to the mark and slowly grazed above it, not daring to touch it herself.“Now Molly if you do touch it, it will call the other members, do you understand? You are never to touch it, unless ordered by another Death Eater, am I clear? Macnair, call the inner circle to me, using her mark.” Molly, rigid with spite, bowed low before the Dark Lord.“Yes, My Lord. And thank you for bestowing this gift upon me.” The Dark Lord chuckled, amused by her progress. Macnair took Molly’s arm and showed her how to call the others. Hesitantly she reached forward, hand shaking as she pressed her index finger to the mark, pushing down into the skin. White hot pain flashed through the mark when she touched it, pulling her right hand back quickly. Macnair showed her his mark, the snake which had been stock still before now wriggled gently on his arm. Molly looked down to her mark, to see it doing the same.“I felt the same pain you did, when you touched the mark.” Molly nodded, leaning back against the wall. Soon they could hear the sounds of others entering the house, making their way up the stairs. They filtered into the room, shuffling until finally, they all stood around the Dark Lord. Molly made eye contact with Narcissa, calming herself slightly in the other woman’s eyes. Others stood around them, many that she had seen at Malfoy Manor. And Snape. Snape stood towards the back of the room, by the door, cold eyes calculating the scene around him carefully. The Dark Lord’s voice silenced the whispering, all focus directed towards him.“I have decided the best way for you to announce my return. In a month’s time, the Quidditch World Cup will take place in Dartmoor. Wizards and witches from all around the world will be present here in Britain. From my informants in the ministry, they are using the help of muggles in the area to help run things. How terribly embarrassing it is, for the magical community to rely on those lowly creatures to function. No, I think it is a great opportunity. You will infiltrate the Quidditch World Cup, my friends, and you will torture the muggles in front of the magical guests. Kill them, by all means. I want the world to know that I am back. Go, and make your plans, my loyal followers, and wreak havoc amongst those who would allow the tainting of the magical with the fowl. You are dismissed.” Macnair pulled Molly to the side, whispering in her ear.“I have things I need to take care of here, along with Lucius. Go back to Malfoy Manor with Narcissa, and care for Walden.” Molly nodded, breaking away from Macnair and limping towards Narcissa. Snape still stood in the corner beside the door, watching Molly’s progress. His eyes lingered on the visible mark on her arm, coldness stealing over the indifference. He turned and left, his cape billowing out behind him. Molly made her way across the room, stepping around the body of the old caretaker gingerly. She caught up to Narcissa at the door, cutting her off.“Macnair advised me to return to the manor with you.” Narcissa nodded and they walked down the staircase together, Narcissa mindful of Molly’s limping pace and matching it. Finally, they reached the dirt path and made their way to the main road, eyes darting back to the manor behind them. Narcissa’s trailed down Molly’s arm, to the Dark Mark.“So, now you are branded one of us. Welcome to the family.” Molly snorted at the disdain in Narcissa’s tone, turning back to the road that led to Little Hangleton.“Thank you, you know, truly felt loved up in there. Never felt closer to anyone, ever. Very grateful for my family.” Though bitterness tinged her tone, the humor did help to soften the sharp sadness in her. They shook their heads and arm in arm, the two women disapparated from Little Hangleton, reappearing at the gates of Malfoy Manor. Molly’s hand drifted to her stomach as the nausea receded and the spinning in her head slowed. Narcissa dropped Molly’s hand, and lifting her own, gestured to the gates before them. Taking a deep breath, Molly walked forwards slowly, hand out to the gates. Her fingers met cool metal, before smoke drifted from the point her fingertip made contact. She pushed forward, passing through the smoke and to the other side, the gate returning to metal behind her. Narcissa followed her through, and they walked side by side, back up to the Manor before them. Narcissa turned to Molly at the door, reading the despair hidden in her eyes.“One day, Molly, things will get better. They have to.” Molly remained focused on the massive wooden doors before them, eyes tracing the patterning etched in the dark wood. Letting out a sigh she turned back to Narcissa slowly, not meeting her gaze.“How, Narcissa? Even if things were to change, how could it get better? Even if the Dark Lord fails, and he does not take over Britain, if I was somehow freed from this Vow with Walden, freed from this manor, freed from any of this, how could it be any better? I will still always be branded a Death Eater, complicit in the actions carried out in his name. I will always be tied to Walden, through my son. I can never escape this, Narcissa. I will always be…” Swept up in her grief Molly paused, a sob catching in her throat. “I will always be marked by this.” After today, she knew. There was no returning to normalcy. Her family could not take her back, marred as she was. If the Dark Lord failed, she would be running from this the rest of her life. “My only hope that is if he does fail, Walter can find somewhere safe, where he is not looked down upon for the circumstance of his birth and raised to know that there is good, and he is not set on a certain path simply because of who his parents are.” Narcissa’s eyes watered at Molly’s words.“All I can hope for Draco is near the same. That he chooses his own path, not the one he thinks is laid before him. But I fear it is set, in his mind. I understand you, Molly. More than you may think.” Molly wiped the tears from her cheeks, setting herself a neutral expression.“Let us go in, I want to see Walter.” Narcissa nodded, opening the heavy doors with a flick of her wand. Molly followed her inside, looking back to watch the doors close behind them softly. They separated at the stairs, Narcissa leaving her with a soft smile and understanding eyes as she turned the hall, out of sight. Molly limped her way up the stairs, knee burning with every step. Making her way into the room, she saw Walter sleeping soundly in his crib, Nia sitting at the chair in the desk, watching over him. Upon Molly’s entrance, she stood from the chair and bowed lowly, smiling at Molly.“Master Macnair has been fed and put to sleep, Mistress. Is there anything I can do for you?” Standing from her bowed position she approached Molly.“I think I would like to bathe, Nia. I feel dirty.” Nia rushed ahead of her into the bathroom, preparing the tub. Molly followed her slowly into the bathroom, removing her garments as she walked. Nia awaited with a filling tub, warm towels laid out beside it on a table, soap in her hand. Molly finished undressing and looked up into the mirror, her breath catching. She barely recognized herself. The collar she had become accustomed to, that didn’t stall her. But her body she had once known so well, even if she had not loved it, was gone. She had lost most of her weight since coming here, her stomach was now flat with very little of the plump padding she had worn since the consecutive births of her children. Her breasts had grown a little smaller in the weight loss as well but were still engorged with milk as she attempted to wean Walter. Bruises still littered her body, her scars stood stark against her now smaller frame. And the mark. Dark black against her forearm, it stood as clear as day against her pale skin. No, Molly Weasley no longer stared back at her in the reflection. Here, before her, was Molly Macnair, a woman she despised. She turned away from the mirror and made her way to the tub, sighing as she stepped into the hot water. Her body relaxed, the soreness in her body easing. She wet her hair and allowed Nia to start washing it, eyes closed to the room around her.“I am done, Mistress.” Nia rinsed her hair softly, handing her the soap bar. Molly scrubbed her body with it, scrubbing harshly at her skin. No amount of scrubbing would help, after all it was her soul that was stained, just as much as her skin was now, but it did help to calm her some as she rinsed the soap from her body. Once she was suds free she stood, accepting the proffered towel from Nia gratefully. Stepping from the tub she dried herself and walked to the bureau and pulling a night gown and under garments from it. Drying her hair softly she pulled the quilt back and sat on the bed. Leaning against the headboard, she thought of her family. She pulled the edge of the mattress back up, retrieving the newspaper clippings from underneath. Nia always made sure when she changed the sheets that they were tucked safely back under. Carefully, Molly unfolded the picture from the Egypt article, smiling sadly at the image. All of them were still waving madly, smiling. How much had her children changed, since this image was taken? The youngest two had been through so much. Too much, for their young ages. She gazed at each member of the family longingly, trying to memorize every feature. Every freckle, barely visible in the black and white image.“Mistress Molly, is there anything else you need?” Nia asked, pulling the quilt to cover Molly’s legs. She shook her head softly, dismissing the elf with a soft thanks. Nia left the room quietly, leaving Molly alone with the image. She looked over to Walter in his crib, sleeping soundly. The sound of his soft breaths filled Molly with a strange fullness, though she knew so much was missing from her. Tucking that image safely back away, she pulled the one of her and Arthur out. Wife of Ministry Official Missing. Through all of this, somehow, that Molly still survived. If she did ever leave here, it would not change her past, her life with him. Though her future would not include him, somewhere deep inside, she knew that version of her still lived. It saddened her to think of Arthur, still awaiting her return. She knew that he wouldn’t give up unless there were undeniable proof she was dead. And somehow, that was the better alternative. She didn’t know if she could ever face him as she was now. She had been labeled a blood traitor, for their views on muggle and magical marriage, but now, she truly was a traitor. Her hand drifted to the leather collar around her neck, a sob escaping her as she looked at the picture of her and Arthur. There was no coming back from this.

Molly followed Macnair down the hall to the first floor of the manor, unnerved by the excitement brimming from the man. Around the corner, there were several more Death Eaters, talking about the upcoming plans. Tonight was the Quidditch World Cup, and tonight they would remind the world that Voldemort was not dead. Macnair pulled Avery aside and whispered to him for a moment, laughing as he pulled away from the exchange. He took to bundles from the other man and turned back to Molly with a terrible smile lighting his face.“Come, Molly. We need to prepare for tonight.” A cold chill stole over Molly as she followed him back up the stairs and to their room. She had been informed a few nights prior that she would partake in the events that would unfold tonight, but she had hoped in that time maybe the plans would have changed or decided she was not needed for them. She knew better, though. Tonight would cement her standing as a Death Eater. Macnair set the bundles onto the bed, unfolding them with care. Black robes, and a horrific mask that looked unnervingly like a human skull. He unwrapped the other as well, setting it before Molly.“Do you like them? We made the masks ourselves, out of the muggles slaughtered for the Dark Lord.” Molly looked up at Macnair in shock, hand covering her mouth as she stepped back away from him. “Oh, don’t look so appalled, my dear. You have to know there was casualties in this war. All these came from the first, war, however. The idea was Rodolphus’. Brilliant it was, to wear these and strike fear into those we fight. Come, try your robes and mask on my love.” Molly stumbled forward, hand shaking as she accepted the mask from Macnair. They tied in the back; the silken cloth sewn through the bone. Molly’s stomach rolled as she pressed the mask over her face, tying it securely in place. The bone pressed sharply into the skin of her cheeks. It was as uncomfortable as it was ghastly, but she bit her tongue and stared Macnair down. He nodded approvingly and handed her the robes, watching her dress into them. He followed suit and soon they both stood in what Molly saw as the visage of death. She took her mask off, placing it into the large pocket of the robes. Macnair set his on the table beside the bed, looking around the room.“Looney will watch Walden tonight, since we will both be occupied. Meet me in the dining room at eight, we will apparate to the grounds after that time. And Molly, tonight you will participate in whatever we ask.” Molly nodded, leaving Macnair in the room. She didn’t seek Walter out, she could not fathom looking her son in the eyes before the took part in the atrocity that would occur tonight. Instead, she made her way to the drawing room and sat, awaiting the time she would be called. Her hands shook as she waited, watching time progress on the large grandfather clock on the wall. Hours seemed to pass as minutes as time marched on. At eight, she stood and made her way to the dining room, where the Death Eaters were congregating. Macnair made his way over to Molly, taking her arm.“We are awaiting a signal from Lucius who is attending the match. Once he calls, we will apparate to his tent. I was there earlier today, so you will apparate with me as you have no knowledge of the location. Prepare yourself, Molly.” Molly nodded, slowing her breath, and attempted to stop the trembling in her hands. White hot fire erupted on her forearm, and she looked to the mark branded on her. The snake was moving softly. Placing her mask over her face in accordance with those around her, Molly tied the mask in place and took Macnair’s proffered arm. The hook behind her navel pulled, the drawing room disappearing around them. They arrived outside a tent on the edge of a large field, in the distance a massive stadium stood erect, and nearby where hundreds of other tents staked, came the sound of raucous celebration. They followed Lucius from the tent down aways, to a shack that stood far from the other tents. A man stood outside; a curious look only belied by a dreamy look in his eyes.“Hello there. Curious lot, you all are. What kind of sporting event is this anyways, swear I could see people flying on brooms earlier? Must have had a bit more to drink than I th-” He was cut off by a cry of Crucio from behind Molly, and the poor muggle fell to the ground in excruciating pain. Molly pulled her wand from her pocket, readying herself for what was about to come. The door to the shack opened, a woman screaming as she watched her husband writhe on the ground. Another next to her, Avery, used the Cruciatus curse on her as well, bringing her to the ground beside her husband. Two children looked out the door, crying in fear at the group amassed around their parents. Rodolphus followed their retreat into the shack, dragging both children by the backs of their nightclothes. He tossed them onto the ground, and Molly watched in dismay as they Cruciatus curse was used on these poor kids as well. The younger of the two appeared to be five at the oldest. After a few minutes of this torture, the lifted the spells from the muggles.“Levicorpus!” The muggles were lifted into the air, whirling around as they attempted to right themselves. Some members of the Death Eaters who had broken off as they left the Malfoy’s tent arrived, their own muggle family lifted high in the air. The group made their way towards the sound of celebration, laughter cackling through the air. Upon reaching the first ring of tents, the Death Eaters in front of her began lighting them on fire, waving the muggle families high into the air. Screams erupted into the night as the magical attendees noticed the approaching Death Eaters, chaos ensuing as people began to run in every direction. Steeling herself, Molly lifted her wand and pointed towards the nearest tent.“Incendio!” The tent burst into flames, and she could hear screams inside as the occupants tried to escape the tent. As they left the opening, Bellatrix stepped in front of the man leaving and used the Cruciatus curse on him, howling with laughter as he fell. They moved on, lighting tents on fire left and right, breaking off into two groups, each with their own muggle family lifted high above them. Molly followed Macnair, deeper into the city of tents. She could see some of the wizards and witches staying at a distance, assessing the situation.“Do not engage! The safety of the muggles is of utmost importance! Do not engage!” So, ministry officials had arrived, and were attempting to protect the muggles at all costs. The woman above them was rotated around, so her that her legs were up in the air, her nightdress falling around her waist and exposing her knickers. Molly lit another tent on fire, the occupants however had long since fled. The Death Eaters broke apart some, each taking a member of the muggle family a different direction. Molly trailed after Macnair, her knee aching as she struggled to keep up with the group. Once away from ministry officials, they dropped the young boy onto the ground, the terrified child screaming for his mother. Macnair waved Molly forward, laughing.“Molly, I want you to practice the Cruciatus curse on this child.” Molly balked, turning to stare in disbelief at Macnair. “Molly, understand this, if you fail to comply tonight, I cannot stop the repercussions that will fall onto your family. The others will hurt them, even if I may not.” Molly gripped the wood of her wand tightly, preparing herself. “You have to mean it, Molly. Imagine what Bellatrix will do with your daughter if she finds her. Do not disappoint us.” Molly nearly cried at this, raising her wand to the child before her. Biting down on her tongue harshly, tasting blood, she cried –“Crucio!” At first, nothing happened, but as she repeated the curse, thinking of protecting her daughter, the child cried out in pain. Not horrific pain but screaming none the less. She hardened herself, casting the curse once more. Her voice was unrecognizable to her as she cast the third curse, the child writhing in agony before her. When Macnair put his hand on hers, Molly lifted the spell, backing away from the child.“Good, Molly. Very good.” She lowered her wand, hand shaking, and placed the wand into her pocket. Around them, the cries of terror had nearly ceased as the remaining tents burned. Bellatrix made her way forward, looking at Molly approvingly.“Not bad.” She laughed as she passed, moving towards the child. “Avada Kedavra!” She cried; the boys scream was cut off abruptly as he dropped to the ground. Surprise and disgust tinged Molly as she stared at the child’s body, and the lack of response she felt in herself to his death. The group around her broke apart as Death Eaters took off in different directions, she followed Macnair closely from the gruesome scene of the boy’s final moments. From somewhere nearby, she heard Crouch shout “Morsmordre!” and high above them, the Dark Mark appeared in the sky. Around them they could see ministry officials appearing, running towards them.“Time for us to leave, Molly.” Macnair grabbed onto her arm roughly, the feeling of apparation tugging at Molly. Not a moment later they were back in Malfoy Manor, other Death Eaters appearing around them in different spots. Untying her mask, Molly stuffed it into her robes and limped to her room, sobbing. The weight of what she had done, of what she had partook in tonight, hung heavily on her chest as she climbed the stairs.  She stopped at the top of the stairs to catch her breath, a sob escaping her lips. Merlin what have I done? She could barely breath through her sobs as she returned to her room, starling Nia as she opened the door. Upon seeing her distress, Nia attempted to help her, but Molly merely waved her out of the room. Nia took her leave, shutting the door behind her as Molly fell onto the bed nearly wailing. The mask in her pocket pressed sharply against her and she flinched, pulling herself off of the bed quickly. She ripped the robes from her body, throwing them into the corner, starling Walter in his crib. He began to cry, reaching out for Molly. All she could see was the child they had left in that clearing. Backing away from her son, she fell to her knees and cried. After a few minutes the overwhelming grief subsided and left her with a cold apathy burning in its wake. Walter was still crying, watching her on the floor. Slowly she rose to her feet, limping towards the crib. Walter’s cries lessened as she reached for him, pulling him into her arms softly.“I’m so sorry, Walter. Mummy’s sorry.” She stood there hushing her child, until his cries died down. She walked over to the bed and sat with him, rocking him gently. Macnair entered the room to see the two of them there, crossing to sit beside Molly on the bed.“You did well tonight, Molly. I am sorry for having to push you the way I did, to perform the curse, but it was necessary. In time it will become easier, I remember when I first performed it. Now it is as easy as breathing.” Molly hoped she never reached that far but remembered the apathy she’d felt after the child had been killed. She looked down to Walter, who was drifting to sleep. A child. She had tortured a child in order to protect her own. Molly pushed the bitter disgust away. It would serve no purpose, except to wear her out. Once Walter had fallen asleep she set him gently into the crib, trying not to wake him. Once he was settled she sat back on the bed with Macnair. He pulled her towards himself gently, running his hands over her body. She realized she hadn’t redressed as his hands ran down her hip, rough fingers on her soft skin. He turned her face towards his and kissed her, pulling her body closer so that she was pressed against him. With the memory of tonight flashing brightly behind her eyes, Molly pressed herself against him harder, kissing him back. Macnair looked at her with a surprised look, before pulling her to sit on his lap.“I told you, Molly, in time all things would become easier. We have forever together, my love.” He reached around her back and unhooked her bra, tossing it to the side onto the floor. She pushed the robes off of his shoulders, tugging at the shirt he wore underneath it and tossing it to join the other discarded clothes on the floor. Macnair grasped her upper arm tightly, rolling them so that she was laying beneath him. He pulled the rest of his clothes off and returned his focus to her, his hands running up and down her thighs. He bent down and kissed her again, biting roughly on her lips. She could taste blood, but in this moment she couldn’t bring herself to care. After all she had done, this was no worse. That apathy she felt earlier resurfaced as she drew her knees apart, allowing Macnair to settle himself between them. He tugged her knickers off gently throwing them over his shoulder.“I have waited for this day, Molly, when you would excitedly give yourself to me.” With that, he lowered his head between her legs, tasting her. Molly’s hips bucked at the feeling of the tongue brushing her, but quickly settled. Arthur briefly crossed through her mind, but she tamped it deep down, leaving it to be dealt with at another time. She couldn’t think of him right now, not tonight. Her attention was brought back to the man between her legs as he licked up her folds, lips sucking around her clit. She let out a gasp as she grabbed the pillow behind her head, digging her nails into it. Tonight, her body and its needs were in control, consequences be damned. Gently a finger probed her, running up and down her slit as she bucked her hips into his mouth, moaning. The finger pushed into her gently, sliding into her slick folds with ease. A second finger soon followed, pushing Molly closer to her orgasm. They slid in and out of her as Macnair lapped at her clit, running his tongue around it roughly. Molly tried to bite back her moans, not wanting to wake Walter, as Macnair drove her headfirst towards her end. The breaking point came as he pulled away from her clit, biting down softly onto the skin of her inner thigh. With a ragged cry Molly came, her hips bucking forward to push his fingers deeper into her, riding out her orgasm. Her breathing was harsh as she came down, eyes closed and thighs pressed tight around the man between them. Slowly he pulled his fingers out, licking them clean. He gave Molly a moment to calm down as he climbed up the bed to lay beside her. Once she had recovered he took her hand and wrapped it around himself, guiding her into a soft stroke. She followed it, Macnair hardening in her grasp. She leaned down once he was hard enough and opened her mouth, enveloping him in it. He let out a groan she bobbed her head, sucking and hollowing her cheeks.“Merlin, yes! Good girl, Molly.” He let this continue for another minute, before he pulled her head up gently, kissing her. He rolled her so that she was on her side, back pressed against his chest. Lifting her leg, he wrapped it over his own, closing the distance between them. He pushed himself against her, rubbing himself up and down through the slick folds before slowly easing inside of her. Molly hissed in pleasure, widening the gap between her thighs, and pushed herself down further onto it. Macnair stalled them for a moment, relishing the feel of being within her.“You feel so good, my Mollywobbles.” She ignored his comment, bucking her hips in attempt to get some sort of friction. He humored her, responding in an opposite thrust that left them rutting against each other roughly. He reached his hand around to cup her breast, moaning as she slid onto him once more. He rolled her onto her stomach, pressing into her so that he lay nearly flat against her back. “On your knees, Molly.” She pushed herself into the position he asked, gasping as he began a fast pace into her. The sound of skin slapping on skin filled the air, only the sound of their pleasure to contend with it. Molly gripped the sheets tightly as she felt another orgasm approaching, Macnair’s rapid pace lighting her nerves on fire. His fingers found her clit once more, throwing Molly into her second orgasm. She nearly saw stars as her arms failed her, she fell onto the mattress with a cry. She pushed her face into the pillow, hoping to muffle the sound that escaped her as she clenched around Macnair. He thrust into her a few more times before he came as well, holding her hips against him tightly. She felt him soften inside of her before he pulled out, laying heavily onto the bed beside her.“Oh Molly. That was amazing.” He wrapped his arm over her, drawing her close against his chest. Within minutes his breathing slowed, a light snore escaping. Molly laid there awhile, ignoring the implications of what she had just done. When sleep didn’t come for her she disentangled herself from his grasp and made her way to the bureau and dug through the drawer, pulling out one of the sleeping draughts Snape had made her. She drank it quickly and set the bottle atop the desk, laying back down beside Macnair. At the feeling of the mattress moving, he rolled closer to her wrapping his arms around her once more. She could feel the potion take effect as she slipped into a dreamless sleep.

Molly stood up from the table, pushing her plate away from her face. Leaving the dining room quickly she made her way back the nearest loo and upended the contents of her stomach. It had been the same for the past few weeks, and Molly knew without a doubt what this meant. Leaning against the counter she settled her hand over her stomach.“You guys really need to take it easy on me. I am getting much too old for this.” A thought crossed Molly’s mind. How old am I? She hadn’t been keeping track, her birthday was not something that was high on the list of priorities here. She counted through the months, trying to place her age. 45. I am 45 years old. 45 and still bearing children. She laughed at that thought. Though she was obviously fertile enough, they had stopped after Ginny. Nine children. In a few months she would have nine children. Shaking her head she flushed the loo, leaving to find Walter. He had been playing on the floor when she’d bolted, and hoped he was still there. He had begun walking a few months ago, and now it was like trying to herd cats, keeping that boy in her sight. Some of his mannerisms, though he had never met his older siblings, were so similar to theirs. Thankfully, he was still seated on the floor, under the watchful eye of Narcissa. “Good morning, Molly. How are you doing today?” Molly laughed, shaking her head once more.“Not great. Sick to my stomach as soon as I ate.” Narcissa looked up to her.“Are you pregnant again?”“It sure feels that way, haven’t been able to keep much of anything down these last few weeks.” The two hadn’t seen much of each other, Molly remaining home for the most part, but Narcissa out on missions with Lucius or of her own.“Well congratulations, Molly. I am sure Walter will enjoy a younger sibling. I was I had been able to give Draco one, but it seems that was not my path to walk.” Molly sat beside Narcissa, pulling her plate back towards herself. Ignoring the eggs this time, she picked at the fruit on the plate and hungrily devoured the toast.“So, what is planned for today.” Over the last few months, an increasing amount of Death Eaters had been occupying the Manor for longer periods of time. It had certainly become the headquarters, of sorts. Narcissa drew her chair closer to Molly’s but leaving it where she could still keep an eye on Walter, who was contentedly playing with the wooden blocks.“I believe that Barty will be coming by today, to plan what Lucius described to me as the final duel. The Dark Lord plans to kill the Potter boy at the end of the term. He has been doing well in the Tournament, though, much to Draco’s irritation.” Molly remembered Draco’s ranting over the Christmas holiday. Molly sighed and picked up the Daily Prophet, scanning the headlines. Dark Wizards and Witches Still at Large Following Quidditch World Cup Attack

No arrests have been made since theattack during the Quidditch World Cupover the summer. Death Eaters have claimedresponsibility for this attack, as made evidentby the appearance of the Dark Markand all former members of the organization still walking free have been questioned,but no ties have been made. Severalmuggle families who were used to helporganize the Cup and help it functionwere attacked, but thankfully they all madea full recovery. This story will be updatedas further information arises. Anyonewith information of the attack isencouraged to contact theAuror’s office immediately. “Are they serious? No muggles were killed? Bellatrix murdered a child, and from the talks of the others, none of the muggles we took survived. How can they lie about that?” Molly was biting back her anger, but she had no ground to stand on. She had participated, after all. “They are trying to keep people from panicking is all. Can you imagine the hysteria that would ensue if they released those muggles had been murdered that night? No, they are going to keep it quiet as long as they can in hopes that this will all blow over soon.” Narcissa picked at the food on her plate, her appetite gone. Molly shook her head softly, her attention returning to Walter. He was lifting himself to his feet, the blocks forgotten off to the side. Molly stood and walked over to him, plucking him off the floor just before he took off running. He laughed, hugging into her chest. “Mummy!” He reached his tiny arms around her neck, trying to pull himself up a little higher. Molly lifted him so that they were face to face, grinning back.“Hello, Walter.” She muttered, rubbing her nose to his. He scrunched his nose and rubbed back, before dropping his arms. She set him down and he took off, his stumbling run bringing a lightness to Molly’s chest. Narcissa followed them out of the dining room and back to Molly’s, collecting the discarded blocks on her way by. Nia was just finishing tidying the bed as they entered, bowing low before the three of them. Molly set Walter up on the bed, sliding her hand under the mattress to bring the two folded articles out. Gently pulling them open to the pictures, she sat beside Walter on the bed and pulled him into her lap. Narcissa sat at the desk, watching the two of them. Pointing to the picture of their family in Egypt, Molly drew Walter’s attention.“Look here, Walter. Who is that? That’s your brother, Bill. He works as a curse breaker in Egypt. And there’s Charlie, he works with dragons in Romania. And Percy. I don’t know what he is doing, now that he is out of school. He always desired a job at the ministry, and he sure is smart enough and hard working to achieve it. I know he will do well, whatever he decided on. And then there’s the twins, Fred and George. Impractical lot, the both of them. But they never failed to get us laughing with their pranks. Then there’s Ron. He was so young when I saw him last, but he was happy. He was at Hogwarts. One day, you may go there. Ron is fiercely loyal; he is friends with Harry Potter. You will know that name one day. But don’t believe the lies they tell about him here, he is a good boy. Brave and loyal as they come. I care for him as one of my own, though I only ever got to see him a few times. They have another friend you won’t see here, named Hermione. She is the brightest witch of her age, according to Ron. And then there is your sister, Ginny. She is as rambunctious as any of the boys, the courage of a lion, that one. Last time I saw her she was boarding the Hogwarts Express, going to her first year.” Molly wiped a tear that had formed in her eye as she pointed his siblings out to Walter. Sliding to the other picture, she showed it to him.“That is Arthur. He was my husband, before I came here. He is a sweet man, Walter. One I hope you get to meet. I know he would love you. Merlin, I hope you get to meet him.” Molly cried, pulling Walter tighter against her. He was watching the picture fixedly, enamored by the movement in it. He pointed to Molly, grinning.“Mumma!” Wiping the tears from her eyes, Molly nodded.“Yes, Walter, that’s Mumma. And there would be your Dadda, in a better world.” The sound of the doorknob turning startled Molly. She shoved the papers into her dress, stuffing them down so they couldn’t be seen. Macnair entered the room, eyes glancing over those in the room.“Good, you’re both here. We are going to the Riddle House again; Barty is coming to ready the plans for June. Molly, give Walter to Looney to watch. We are to leave at once.” He walked away from them, leaving the door wide open. Molly looked over to Nia, who nodded and made her way over to Walter. Molly returned the folded papers under the mattress carefully, making sure they were not near the edge.“I have him, Mistress Molly.” Molly left the room, followed by Narcissa. On the way out they grabbed their cloaks, in anticipation of the bitter wind outside. Molly grabbed Narcissa’s hand, stalling her.“I can’t apparate, Narcissa. The baby! What if I splinch myself?” Narcissa looked around for a moment, thinking.“We can’t fly though, and the Riddle House isn’t attached to a floo network. I am confident with apparating you alongside myself, Molly. I have been back and forth between the manor for months, alongside Lucius. You will be fine, I promise.” Molly acquiesced, trusting Narcissa. They made their way into the snowy yard, following other Death Eaters down to the gates. Smoke enveloped Molly momentarily, before dissipating behind her. Molly took Narcissa’s outstretched hand and together, they disappeared from Wiltshire, and appeared on the road outside Little Hangleton. The snow crunched under them as they group made their way up to the old manor, entering once more through the back door. Molly felt a chill run up her spine as she crossed the threshold.Making their way up the twisting staircase, Molly made sure to stay behind the others as not to slow them down with her hobbled limp up the stairs. Once she entered the room, Crabbe shut the door behind her and pushed her up to stand beside Macnair. Standing in the center of the room stood a man Molly had not seen in many years, and his presence shocked her. Alastor Moody was bent, speaking with the Dark Lord. Turning to Macnair she hissed quietly“What is Moody doing here? I thought he was part of the Order in the last war? Are you not concerned he may be a double agent?” Macnair chuckled lightly, casting a sideways glance at Molly.“That, my dear, is not Alastor Moody. But the concern for our movement is well noted. No, that is Barty. Over the summer he took Moody and replaced him as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts. He has been very crucial in the plans to bring about Harry’s involvement with the Triwizard Tournament. Placed himself as Potter’s mentor. Now if you would hush, I think we are about to begin.” Molly stepped back a little, to signify her acceptance of the conversation’s end. Crouch stood and walked away from the Dark Lord, taking a place beside the fire.“Alright you lot.” He looked around the room, his signature quirk giving Crouch away as he licked his lips quickly before continuing. “The end of the Triwizard Tournament is approaching. A few weeks ago, the Potter boy completed the second task in second place. He is progressing well, and I have made sure to remove any roadblocks. The final task is on June the twenty-fourth, and I want you ready. The plan is as such, I will replace the cup with a portkey. I will take care of the other competitors; we wouldn’t want the wrong one to show up in the graveyard that night. The final competition is to be a maze so it may take some time for him to reach the portkey. My lord, you and Wormtail will be waiting for him there.” Molly’s eyes flicked to Pettigrew, who stood cowering in the corner at the mention of his name. “Once the potion is complete and you have your body back, My Lord, you will be in full power to kill him once more. At that time, the rest of us shall be called to return to Our Lord’s side as he kills the Potter boy, and bear witness to the full return of the Dark Lord.” Molly let out a slow breath, her eyes turning to the floor.“Thank you, Barty, for taking on this position at the school this year. You have been a valuable asset, along with Snape, for the goings on there. Dumbledore thinks he is so wise, having an Auror in position at the school.” The Dark Lord cut off with a soft chuckle that ringed out to the followers in the room, overcut by Bellatrix’s raucous laughter. He continued, taking a deep breath. “Soon this shall be the end of the boy who lived, and I shall be at my full power with none to stand in my way but that old fool Dumbledore. Yes, Barty, you have done well up until this point, but make sure you do not disappoint me in the end.” His voice ran cold at the last remark, a grim warning clear in his tone. “You are all dismissed, apart from those who are crucial to the unfolding of these plans. Leave us now.” Macnair took Molly’s hand, leading her from the house. They made their way to the road, tightening their cloaks to the chill in the air. Molly felt apprehension as they disapparated but calmed upon reaching the gates of Malfoy Manor whole. They made their way into the warm halls, Molly following his lead back to the room. Nia and Walter were nowhere to be found, and Macnair seemed to take appeal to that. He turned to face her, grasping her wrist tightly.“Now Molly since the night last summer you have not given yourself to me so willingly as you did that night. I do not like having to stoop to these lows, but I want tonight to be enjoyable. It would be much easier if you approached this with some level of enthusiasm, but I will accept this where it lies. You are my wife, and I will not be denied what is due to me.” He made his way over to the bureau, withdrawing a small phial from it. “Now, drink this.” Molly took the glass phial from him apprehensively. Inside was a pearlescent liquid. Molly uncorked it slowly, overcome by the scent rising from it. It smelled like tea, fresh baked bread, and Arthur’s cologne. She knew what this was, and it terrified her that he would resort to this.“You are making me take Amortentia, Walden?” She asked, lowering her hand.“Yes, Molly. And I will not ask again. You can enjoy this, or it can be forced. Take your pick.” His voice was laced with a dangerous tone, his eyes hardening. Molly nodded slowly, looking away from him and putting the phial to her lips. Hesitantly she smelled it once more, overwhelmed by the scent of her husband. Sighing, she drank the liquid quickly, trying to not let the taste linger in her mouth. The effects were nearly immediate, a feeling of wooziness overcame Molly, her senses dulling some. Macnair sidled up beside her, his hands running down her hips. Molly looked at Macnair as if through new eyes, hers darkening in a true desire he had not seen since her coming here. “Oh Mollywobbles.” He moaned, pulling her in for a kiss. She attacked him as if she were starving, throwing her whole body against his as she kissed him back. Macnair shuffled them over to the bed, tossing her onto it. Nearly ripping her clothes off Molly prepared herself for him, undressing Macnair nearly as quickly as she had herself. She pushed him down onto the bed, sliding her body down his until her mouth was above him, slowly taking him into it. He groaned, carding his fingers through her hair, encouraging her downwards. Molly’s head was spinning as she bobbed, reacting to the coursing desire but a mental disconnect deepened as she continued her movements.“Sweet Merlin, Molly!” Macnair’s fingers grasped her hair tightly, the pain a distant reality to Molly as she continued to suck Macnair with fervor. After a few minutes he pulled her head away, moaning. “I won’t last at that rate, Molly.” She made her way up his body, nipping gently. Hovering over him she lowered herself, rubbing her dripping folds against him desperately. With a cry she sank down on him, collapsing against his chest as the overwhelming sensation of being filled enveloped her. He gave her a moment to adjust, before encouraging her to move with a gentle buck of his hips. Molly gasped at the movement, clenching tightly around him. With some effort, she forced herself up into a frantic bounce, dully aware of a pain in her knee as she moved. Macnair grasped her hips tightly, aiding some in her movements. The bouncing  was dizzying to her, her head dropping onto his shoulder as the room began to spin. Noticing her fatigue with these movements he turned them, laying her gently onto the bed. Pushing her legs up some and wrapping them around his waist, he continued his thrusts rapidly, pressing his hand down against her lower stomach gently. The effect was immediate with Molly, as she choked on a cry and tightened her legs around him.“Walden I’m gonna- I’m!” With a strangled cry Molly came, her legs tightening roughly around Macnair and nearly stalling his movements inside her. He groaned at the contractions as her orgasm rippled through her, her entire body shaking gently as her fingers twisted the sheets beneath her.“Damn, Molly. So- so tight…” He muttered, pushing into her again. It didn’t take him long to finish, pushing her overstimulated body into a second orgasm as his fingers circled her clit roughly. He groaned softly, relaxing his body over hers as they both gasped for air. He rolled off of her gently, sprawling out on the bed beside her. It took him only minutes to fall asleep, wrapping his arms tightly around Molly. She curled into him gently, pulling the quilt folded at the bottom of the bed over them. She quickly followed him into sleep, her head still spinning.

Molly pulled her black robes back onto her, readjusting them gently over her expanding middle. The bump was not obvious yet, but she could feel the tightness in her trousers underneath as she pulled them up higher in an attempt to make it more comfortable. With some effort, her stomach was entirely hidden from sight. Sighing she pulled the mask off the dresser and pocketed it, along with her wand. She made her way out of the room and into the neighboring room, where Walter had been moved when Walden had discovered her pregnancy. Nearly two now, he was much more comfortable being apart from them for longer periods of time, and with Nia to take care of him she held no worries for his safety. He was playing contentedly on the floor, looking to her as she opened the door. A wide grin broke across his face at the sight of her, leaving the blocks forgotten behind him as he toddled towards her.“Mumma!” She picked up the child, sweeping him through the air and into a tight hug.“Oh, my precious boy, look at you!” Releasing him she sat him back down, kneeling beside him.“Now Walter, I am going out for a while. You play with Nia, ok?” He smiled again, bringing one of his blocks over to Molly. “I am sorry, Walter, Mumma can’t play right now. I have to go, but I will see you in the morning, ok?” She handed the block back to him, and he sat on the floor with it, stacking it gently on top of another. Molly kissed him on the top of the head gently, ruffling his soft curls as she left. He smiled at her one last time, and something struck Molly like a blow. His lopsided grin was the spitting image of the twins. Her breath catching in her throat she left him there, safely tucked away in his room. She made her way to the dining room where Narcissa was, sitting beside her to eat. Picking at the food she managed to force down a few bites, watching the hand on the clock make its way around the face.“Are you prepared for tonight, Molly?” Molly shook her head softly, lowering her voice to a whisper so that the others seated further up the table could not hear her.“No, Narcissa. If he succeeds tonight, I don’t know what I will do. Apart from the ramifications it would present for the rest of the world, and I know it’s wrong for me to not care, but Harry comes first to me. I loved that boy as if he were one of my own, and I cannot imagine the toll it will bear on my children if he is to die tonight. I don’t know if I can watch him die.” She bit down on her tongue, trying to push deep the emotions that were threatening to spill over. Damn pregnancy hormones. They made it nearly impossible for her to hold any semblance of stoicism. Narcissa simply looked at Molly, barely disguising the sympathy she held in her gaze. Molly knew she cared, far beyond any other within these walls, but still, she must hold a face of indifference. Molly took a sip of the water in the goblet before her, wetting her dry mouth. A flash like fire burned across her forearm. She looked down to the snake writhing on her arm.“Time to go.” They spoke no more, Molly taking one final glance towards the clock against the wall. 11 o’clock. Her mind drifted back to the clock in her own home and wondered where each hand on it now pointed. Turning back to follow Narcissa she made her way out of the house into the balmy summer evening. Once they were past the gates they placed their masks over their faces, Molly placing her hand in Narcissa’s and together they apparated to the graveyard. It was chillier there, a light fog hovering over the grounds. As they walked to the main clearing, tombstones appeared and then vanished from sight, the fog sweeping around them silently. Once they were assembled before the Dark Lord, now stood tall and robed in black as well, they silenced themselves waiting for his next movement. He walked over to the assembled Death Eaters, clicking his tongue.“Welcome back, my friends. Thirteen years it’s been since we have stood together like this. I thank you for all you have done, to return me to my full power. To those who held key roles, there will be great rewards. Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Macnair, Bellatrix, Rodolphus. And to those who held minor roles, it will not be overlooked. Today we stand at full power once more, and today will mark the turn in this war.” Laughter jeered around them, Bellatrix’s cackle chief among the noise. Molly looked to the ground, uneasy as the Dark Lord looked over those assembled around them. He walked back to the main clearing where Wormtail stood, looking him over.“And you, Wormtail. You who returned out of fear, not loyalty. But still, you have been most useful these last few months. No, you should be rewarded, should you not?” With a wave of his wand, the bloodied stump at the end of Pettigrew’s arm transfigured into an elegant silver hand. He looked it over in awe, eyes returning to the Dark Lord.“Thank you, Master.” He squealed, running to stand by the other Death Eaters. The Dark Lord turned his eyes down to a body that lay on the ground, turning the boy’s face over with his foot.“What a shame.” He tsked, stepping away from him.“Stay away from him!” Molly removed her eyes from the clump of grass she had been focused on, drawn to a voice she had not heard in years. Tears sprang to her eyes as she saw Harry, held in place by the scythe of a statue of the muggle grim reaper. She bit back a sob as the Dark Lord made his way over to Harry, laughing,“Ah, Harry, I had almost forgotten you were here! Do you know how you survived that night? You see, when Dear Lily Potter gave her life to save yours, she cast a powerful protection charm. It was old magic; I did not see it coming. But now, Harry, things have changed. I can touch you now.” He reached a finger forward, sweeping the hair away from Harry’s forehead and placing his finger against the lightening scar. Harry screamed in agony, the Dark Lord cackling before drawing his hand away from the boy. Backing away he flicked his wand, freeing Harry from his entrapment. The assembled Death Eaters backed away, opening the clearing for the Dark Lord.“Come on, get up, get up!” The Dark Lord yelled, pacing around the clearing. “Dumbledore taught you how to duel, I assume. First, we bow.” He bowed before Harry, who stood with his wand drawn, refusing to move. The image before Molly struck her, as she realized just how much time had passed. Gone was the young boy she’d had at the Burrow years ago. No, he had grown much in the time since then. He stood proud, despite his fear, as he stared down the Dark Lord. She felt a swell of pride as he straightened his back, glaring at the Dark Lord. He flicked his wand once more, forcing Harry into a low bow. “There we are, and now, we begin!” Both stepped back as they cast their spells, dazzling bursts of green and red colliding. The group around her backed up some more, pressing themselves against the surrounding tombstones.For a few minutes they gave all they had, trying to gain an upper hand over one another, both spells gaining and receding back towards the castors. Molly bit her lip as she watched the red from Harry’s wand gain, pushing the Dark Lord back some. Gasps erupted around her as gold began to explode out from where the two spells met, surrounding the two wizards. Inside the covering of gold, they could barely see, but what appeared to be ghosts were appearing. The visage of a young boy Molly did not know appeared, but his body lay in the clearing. Most likely he was a student at Hogwarts. Next the muggle caretaker that Crouch had killed appeared, followed by Lily and James Potter, who Molly had not seen since before the birth of Ron. Words were being exchanged between the apparitions and Harry, but nothing comprehensible reached their ears. After a moment they converged on the Dark Lord, a billow of fog erupting about him. Molly watched as Harry bolted from the fight, dropping to the ground beside the boy’s body and drawing the cup towards him. In a flash, they both were gone. The Dark Lord ran out of the swirling fog and into the empty clearing. An unearthly yell emitted from him. Bellatrix made her way to him, bowing low before him.“My Lord, what do you need us to do?” She asked, her voice trembling. He looked at her with hatred, spitting his next words.“Leave me! Go! I will come to you when I am ready.” Bellatrix flinched, receding from before him. The assembled Death Eaters broke apart, disapparating around her. Molly did not look for Narcissa in the crowd, instead envisioning Malfoy Manor and leaving on her own. She appeared before the gates in one piece, making her way up the path to the doors quickly. Other Death Eaters milled around her as she made her way to Walter’s room, removing her mask and outer cloak before she reached the doors. With a final glance to the Dark Mark on her arm she sighed, pushing the doors to the room open. Nia sat in the corner, watching over a sleeping Walter. He was resting peacefully, gentle puffs of air escaping him. Molly ghosted her hand over his face, not wanting to wake the child. She left the room quietly, Nia following her into the main bedroom. She tossed the robes onto the desk, making her way into the bathroom and stripping her clothes from her body. She turned the water on, waiting for it to warm before stepping into the tub. Nia made her way into the bathroom, holding a fluffy towel and nightclothes. Molly washed herself quickly, not bothering to clean her hair. Stepping out from the water she pulled the stopper on the tub, letting it drain. She accepted the towel from Nia, drying herself and putting on the nightclothes.“Mistress Malfoy is waiting for you in the room, Mistress.” Molly set her towel on a hook to dry, opening the door to the bedroom. She took the robe Nia was offering her, shrugging it on gently and tying it lightly around her middle. She sat on the bed beside Narcissa, not saying anything.“Well, the boy survived. Molly, for your safety I want to practice occlumency with you. I am afraid that you are too easy to read, and as time moves on I fear the Dark Lord may see into your mind and not be pleased with what he finds. I don’t want you to be hurt.” Molly looked at her, eyes wide.“He uses legilimency?” Narcissa nodded.“He is gifted in it. I trained back in school with the divination professor and became good at it to. I am able to keep even the Dark Lord from my mind, only allowing him what I want him to see. Severus does the same, he is as nearly gifted as the Dark Lord is. Let me train you, please. For your safety, and for Walter’s. The Unbreakable Vow keeps Walden from doing anything, but if the Dark Lord chooses to hurt any of your family there is nothing that can be done.” Molly nodded, grasping Narcissa’s hand.“Please, teach me.” Narcissa stood, facing Molly.“Empty yourself of all emotion. Let nothing surface. In time, we will work on letting others see what you want, rather than nothing at all. I am going to enter your mind, Molly, and hopefully soon you will begin to be able to hide what I am looking for. Use your love for your family as a driving force for this, Molly. It will not be easy; few people are able to master this.” Molly grit her teeth, nodding. She could not fail, not matter how long this took her. Narcissa focused her eyes on Molly, and Molly emptied her mind of everything. She felt a probing at her mind, quickly pushing through and into her memories.“Molly, you need to work harder. I am reading you like a book, I can see everything. Your memories, your thoughts. Lock me out, or your children will suffer.” Anger flared in Molly at that thought, and she forced her mind to be blank, imagining almost a mental wall between her and Narcissa. A sweat broke out on Molly’s brow as she attempted to hold Narcissa out, but she could feel the wall cracking. Once more, Narcissa pushed through and into her mind. Memories of her and Arthur surfaced, flashes of a night together playing behind her eyes. She knew that night, and well. It was the night Ginny had been conceived. Pushing that wall back forward she drained all emotions from her mind, not allowing even a thought to pass through. She could feel Narcissa pushing against it, trying to find a way through.“Molly, this is a form of magic, not just sheer willpower. Draw from deep inside you, use that well that is inside.” Molly closed her eyes, splitting her focus between the wall she had erected and imagining a pool in her stomach, drawing up from it. A warmth flooded her mind, reinforcing the wall. She could still feel Narcissa probing the wall, pushing further into it. The wall crumbled once more, and memories of chasing the twins through the Burrow yelling at them surfaced. Molly sighed, the wall falling apart entirely.“Do not be discouraged, Molly. This is a powerful and difficult branch of magic, those who are not gifted struggle with it. Already, you are showing promise. It took me time to break through. We will continue this indefinitely, working to strengthen your mind against attack. I will not give up on you, I swear. Prepare yourself again. Molly relaxed her body this time, focusing on the pooling feeling in her stomach and drawing it upwards, to a wall she erected around her mind. She let all her emotions sink deep within her, emptiness taking its place. She opened her eyes, meeting Narcissa’s gaze once more. She felt the probing against her mind once more, stronger than it had been before. She imagined the wall growing thicker, stronger against the attack on it. Narcissa narrowed her eyes, pushing harder against Molly. She felt a crack and drew from that well, pushing back against the crumbling wall. Sweat was dripping down her face now, the nightgown sticking against her skin damply.“You are doing well, Molly.” An overwhelming pressure slammed into the wall, taking it down. Memories of Ron’s birth surfaced the emotions she had felt that day overwhelming her. She gasped, grabbing her head against the breach that left her mind spinning. Narcissa made her way to Molly, sitting on the bed beside her. “You did well, Molly. Better than I expected for you first lesson. We will keep working on it, your ability will grow. Like I said, it is a difficult form of magic rarely studied.” She leaned an exhausted Molly against her, rubbing her sweat dampened back gently. Once Molly had rested for a few minutes, she helped her lay back into the bed and covered her, removing her robe.“Sleep, Molly. It has been a tiring day, and well will work again on the occlumency lessons tomorrow. It is going to be hard work, every day until I am satisfied you are safe. Once we have strengthened your barriers, we will work on allowing others what you want them to see, ok?” Molly nodded, resting her head against the pillow. She closed her eyes as Narcissa left, exhaustion sweeping over Molly’s body. Her hand settled on her stomach, palming the small bump gently.“I will do everything I can to protect you, my love. You and all your siblings. She rolled onto her side, keeping her arm around her stomach. The door opened once more, Macnair entering. He undressed from his robes and settled into the bed, wearing no more than his pants. He curled against Molly, his hand enveloping over hers.“How are you doing tonight, my dear?” He asked, pressing his body closer to hers. Molly sighed, rolling to face him.“Tired. It has been a long day, and this baby is making me nauseous.” Macnair chuckled lightly.“It is not a high price to pay, considering the outcome.” Molly snorted, pushing him away gently.“Says the man who never has to be pregnant. It’s not that easy, you know. Nausea, bloating, cravings, back pain, ankles swelling, weight gain, hard to breath, heartburn, varicose veins, have to pee all the time, then, of course, actually pushing a baby the size of a watermelon out of a hole entirely too small. It is difficult work, Walden.” He laughed once more, pulling her back to him. She resisted for a moment, memories of him touching her swelling the nausea in her stomach, and the reminder of him using Amortentia striking fear in her. She pushed it aside, relaxing into his hold.“I concede, Molly. It does sound difficult. More than I would be able to handle.” She laughed, looking up to him.“More than any man could handle, they are too weak. One week of pregnancy and men would die out.” Macnair shrugged, pulling Molly into a soft kiss. The memory Narcissa pulled forward earlier resurfaced, Arthur filling her mind. She pulled away from the kiss, feigning exhaustion as she curled into Macnair’s chest. “Goodnight, Walden.” She mumbled, receiving a halfhearted grunt in response. She laid there awhile before a deep sleep finally fell over her, the sound of Macnair’s snores lulling her under.

Molly cried out in pain as she bore down, kneeled over the bed. She could feel the shoulders of her child catching, not passing through her the way they should. Narcissa dabbed her forehead once more, the cold water a soothing balm against Molly’s hot skin. She tried to push once more, accepting defeat in this position. She moved into a squat, opening the space between her legs a little more. They were shaking uncontrollably as she tried to hold herself up, grateful for the assistance from Narcissa. With a cry she felt the shoulder pop free, some relief coming with the slight release of pressure. Holding her breath she pushed once more, relief rolling through her as her child finally slid free from her body. She caught the child, falling to her knees without the support of her hands. A loud cry left the child, Molly sighing at the healthy sound. Disentangling the child from her skirt she stood shakily, leaning heavily on Narcissa who helped her towards the bed. Once she was seated she pulled the child safely against her chest, looking the baby over.       “It’s a girl, Narcissa.” She whispered, one hand going to cover her face as she cried. After a moment she lifted her blouse, bringing the babe to her breast. It took only seconds, once the child smelled her milk she latched on, suckling hungrily at Molly’s breast, her cries quieting. Molly leaned against the headboard, exhausted by her long labor. She had awoken the night before, a painful contraction rippling through her as she felt the bed beneath her grow wet. Before that, she had thought it was false labor. She stroked her daughter’s head gently, humming tunelessly as her daughter ate.“Macnair said you could name daughters, correct? What name have you chosen for her?” Molly’s eyes watched her daughter as she thought for a moment.“There was a name Arthur and I had considered for Ginny before we settled on her name. I might as well use that. Amelia Florence will be her name, after a cousin of mine I grew up with. And Arthur loved the idea of the name Amelia, he wanted to call her Millie. Thank you, Narcissa. For everything.” No more words were needed between the two as Narcissa helped her to clean the now crying child, unhappy with the bath. Molly picked her wand up, cleaning the mess on the bed and floor.“Vulnera Sanentur.” Molly whispered, aiming the wand towards her stomach. Relief rippled through Molly as she felt the damage heal, pointing her wand now towards the umbilical cord. “Diffindo.” The cord separated and Molly sat back, waiting for the placenta to detach, and come free. It took only a few minutes longer before it fell free of Molly, and she waved her wand at it. “Evanesco.” It disappeared and Molly cleaned the sheets once more. “Scourgify.” She stood on tired legs and made her way towards the crib, setting the child into it gently. She pulled out a cloth diaper and some pyjamas, dressing the child against the chilled winter air.“Narcissa, can you go get Walter for me?” Narcissa nodded, taking the basin of water and rags with her. She returned a few minutes later, leading Walter by the hand. The energetic toddler lit up upon seeing his mother, running over to her excitedly. Molly put her finger to her lips, shushing Walter as he approached.“Walter, this is your sister, Amelia. You have to be quiet and calm, she is fragile.” Helping Walter onto the bed, she nestled him beside her and settled Millie between them. Walter looked at Molly, then towards the baby, unsure. “Just be gentle, Walter. Very gentle.” He reached to his sister, touching her face softly. Millie’s eyes opened and she looked at her brother, before letting out a little squawk and crying. Walter looked to Molly, shocked. “It’s okay, Walter.” Molly chuckled softly, rocking Millie in her hands. At her response Walter laughed as well, reaching out to Millie’s tiny hand. Millie calmed as Molly rocked her, humming to her once more.“Walter, can you say her name? Mi-llie.” She said, looking down to Walter. He watched Molly repeat the name a few more times, looking back down to his sister.“Miwli.” He stated, looking back to Molly. Molly laughed, taking her free hand to hug Walter.“That’s very good, Walter. Millie.” She answered, smiling at him. He smiled back, the same lopsided grin that reminded her so much of the twins. As he grew she could see more of her other children in him. Ginny’s fearlessness as he tackled any obstacle before him. Bill’s laugh. The same freckles that spotted all her children’s faces, even if it was less pronounced on his. He had her nose, which was prominent on Percy and Ron, and similar on the twins as well. And her eye shape, which Ginny and Charlie sported. His jawline was more his father’s every day, and his eyes mirrored Walden’s own, but held a gentle warmth unlike Walden. And his fingers where similar to hers, short and delicate, unlike Walden’s which were long and thin. Her eyes shifted to Millie, looking her features over. Her eyes were a dark blue, darker than Walter’s had been when he was born. Her eyes may shift to brown as she gets older, Molly thinks. Her face was much rounder than Walter’s, closer to Molly’s shape than her fathers. Her nose was more angular though, but her hair was a soft red like Molly’s.“Another ginger joins the lot, Walter. If we ever go home you won't stick out like a sore thumb.” She chuckled, kissing her son on the head gently. Standing gingerly, her body still sore from her labor she made her way slowly to the crib, wrapping Millie in a softly. She fell asleep quickly, swaddled in a tight blanket. She made her way back to Walter, sitting with him again. “Walter, can you name your family?” She asked, pulling him into her lap. Walter thought for a moment, trying to place all the many names she had given to him. She showed him the picture from Egypt as much as she could, reminding him of his siblings far away.“Mumma. Daddy. Dadda. Bill. Chawlie. Pewcy. Fwed. Geowge. Won. Ginny. Miwli.” He responded, looking towards her. Molly’s eyes watered as he named them all, including Arthur. She had made it very clear to him he was never to talk about the others in front of anyone besides her, and he had picked up on it quickly. His little lisp on his r’s made Molly chuckle. “Very good, Walter. Yes, that is your family. And one day, you may get to meet them. I hope you do; they would love you.” Narcissa drew Molly’s attention towards her as she sat at the desk.“How are you feeling, Molly?” She asked.“Sore and a bit tired, but fine other than that.” Narcissa nodded, looking towards Walter.“Are you feeling up towards practicing your occlumency? You have been progressing well, but I don’t want it to slip. We still have along ways to go.” Molly sighed, readjusting Walter beside her.“Yes, I can do that. Maybe not as long today, but you are correct.” Narcissa shifted in her chair, fixing her gaze on Molly. Molly emptied herself of all her emotions with a well-practiced ease, her face entirely blank as she looked Narcissa in the eyes. She imagined that wall once more, drawing from the imaginary pool of magic deep inside her. She felt Narcissa’s probing and reinforced every area she pressed, shifting her focus in a dancelike motion to Narcissa’s movements against her. When she felt a crack, she would apply more force in response, barring Narcissa from entering. Anywhere she felt the wall begin to crumble, she reinforced and rebuilt. Withdrawing, Narcissa smiled to Molly.“You have come far. You are gifted in this; I will give you that. But the Dark Lord is much stronger than I, you need to prepare for a forceful attack. Prepare yourself, Molly. Molly nodded, emptying her mind once more and putting forth a thicker wall, flooding it with energy from the pool inside her. It shook violently against Narcissa’s attack, cracking down to its foundations, but it held. Molly worked frantically, rebuilding it, and applying new layers as Narcissa attempted to breach and finally, made her way through. Memories from this morning came front and center, the emotions that came with Millie’s birth flooding her mind. Molly sighed, sitting back.“You did exceptionally well, Molly. That was my full strength, and you very nearly held your ground against me. Give this some more time, and you may be even stronger than I. But this brings us to our next step, allowing me to see what you decide. We will try several things, showing me memories of your choice when I enter. Showing me lies you construct and presenting them as truth, believably so. And then legilimency, penetrating another’s mind. When we get to that, you will be able to show me memories of your choice in my mind, or view another’s of your choosing. Sifting through their memories, thoughts, or emotions. Discerning truth from lie. When I enter your mind this time, and I want you to allow me in, I want you to direct me where you want me to go. Over time, it will become more natural and feel as if I am the one leading you, but for now it will be obvious. Lead me to the memories you want me to see, the emotions and thoughts you are telling me are true. Are you ready?” Molly nodded, reconstructing the wall in her mind. This time however, she left a weak spot near the bottom for Narcissa to find, a weak crag to wiggle through into her mind.She felt Narcissa searching her defense, zeroing in on the weakened spot she left. Narcissa pressed forward, Molly offering a feeble defense before opening her mind to her intrusion. Her mind completely blank, she pulled forward some memories of her and Walter from a few months ago, letting those play for Narcissa. With them, she pushed forward the feeling of contentedness and joy. Narcissa nodded approvingly, withdrawing from her mind.“It felt forced, but you did it. I couldn’t do that well when I first started, you are doing exceedingly well. When I probe this time, I will be doing so with the intent of the Dark Lord. I will be looking for any signs of disloyalty, any feelings of discontent. When he looks into you, he will be seeking unfailing devotion, and you must present that. Prepare yourself, Molly.” Molly emptied her mind once more, rebuilding the wall with a weakened spot. Once Narcissa breached the wall Molly pushed forward a feeling of devotion, envisioning the Dark Lord. Narcissa swept around it, probing deeper to the edges of her mind. Molly allowed her to see nothing else but that devotion, sinking everything else deeper into the recesses of her mind. Narcissa pulled back, smiling to Molly.“Again.” She brought herself against Molly’s mind without warning, slamming through Molly’s feeble defense. Molly swelled everything under, allowing utter conviction and respect to show. Narcissa probed it roughly, inspecting every aspect of her mind Molly allowed her to see. Sighing, she receded.“Well done. I was not able to penetrate deeper into what you were hiding. The devotion you were presenting was very stiff, but you are coming along quickly.“One more thing for today. I want you to enter my mind. I will offer no resistance today; we will only focus on entering another’s mind. That same force you use to prevent me from entering and imagine it pushing forth into my mind while you cast the spell Legilimens.” Molly nodded, dividing her focus between maintaining her wall and pushing beyond it. She focused hard on Narcissa, using that pool of energy to reach forward into her mind as she flicked her wand, muttering the spell. Nothing happened, frustrating Molly. She pushed it harder, forcing herself into Narcissa’s mind. It was difficult to maintain, but she watched a memory of Narcissa and Draco when he was young, listening to Narcissa’s thoughts and emotions from that day. Jarringly she was pulled back into her own mind.“We will be done for today, you are exhausted, but you are doing very well, Molly. It will take some time, but one day you will cast it well. Then we can focus on nonverbal application. It took me many years to be able to do this wandless.” She moved to Molly, sweeping the sweat dampened hair from her forehead. The clock ticking on the wall read 9 o’clock, the window dark. Narcissa left her, taking Walter into the next room and laid him down for bed. Molly fed Millie quickly, burping the small baby before laying her back down to sleep. She curled up under the covers, falling into a tired sleep. She didn’t know how long she had been sleeping, when the sound of someone entering the room awoke her.“Walden, is that you?” She mumbled, voice still thick with sleep. Sitting up, she searched the dark room for Macnair’s tall shadow. Accepting defeat in the impenetrable shadows she pulled her wand, softly lighting a few of the candles in the chandelier above the bed. Who stood in the room shutting the door was not Macnair, but Arthur. Molly sat bolt upright, drawing the covers off of her.“Arthur? Arthur, what are you doing here?” She asked, her voice wavering as a lump formed in her throat. He turned to face her, a grim expression on his face. He walked towards her calmly, sitting on the bed without uttering a word. Molly began to cry, throwing her arms around Arthur and clutching him to her tightly. She was pulled from her sobbing as she felt his arm moving up hers, grasping her wrist tightly. “Arthur, what is it?” She asked, trying to pull away from him. His grip tightened, holding her still. He leaned forward, pressing a rough kiss against Molly’s lips. Molly tried to pull back, but Arthur simply followed pushing her down onto the bed. “Arthur, stop!” She cried, pushing his shoulders back. It did no good as he was much stronger than her as he pulled her skirt aside and freed himself from his trousers. Molly cried out as Arthur pushed himself into her, his other hand holding her right leg in place.“Arthur don’t!” She screamed, thrashing underneath him. “You were s-supposed to save me… Wh- why are you d-doing this?” She asked, her body wracking with sobs as Arthur continued his pace inside of her. Millie started crying in her crib as Molly’s sobs turned into short screams, Arthur pushing into her relentlessly. “Please Arthur, let me get my daughter. She is crying, please!” He took no heed as he pushed her legs further apart, nearing his release. Molly cried as he came, pulling her tight against his body and crying out. Molly laid there as he panted, cold realization seeping through her.“You aren’t Arthur. What did you do, Walden?” She asked, her voice empty. A chuckle escaped the man next to her as he rolled to face Molly.“Took you a minute to figure that out, didn’t it?” The sound of Walden’s greasy voice coming from Arthur’s body disgusted her, a shiver running through her body. “So, we have a daughter do we? What did you name the little bastard?”“Amelia Florence. You did not answer my question, Walden. What did you do to Arthur?” He let out a sigh, sitting up.“Clearly I did nothing to him, Molly. Or did you forget our vow? No, the Dark Lord was searching for something in the Department of Mysteries, and Arthur stood between him and what he was seeking. Bastard man of yours joined the Order, was there on Dumbledore’s orders. Protecting what we were seeking. Nagini attacked him, left him a shuddering, bloody mess. I just happened to stumble on opportunity, my dear. Took some of his hair as he lay dying, slipping out of consciousness. Watching the light leave his eyes was absolutely enticing, and the idea of coming home looking like him to you was intoxicating. I wish you could have seen what I did, the hope blossoming in your eyes. And then choking the life from it as I took you. No, I didn’t doubt you would not understand I wasn’t Arthur, but my dear it was well worth it. Just think, Molly, we are free of him. None survive an attack from Nagini. He is gone.” Molly curled into a ball on her side, back facing Macnair as she sobbed. He left her there, redressing and leaving the room as his skin bubbled and returned to the visage of Macnair.Molly was drawn back to the room at the sound of Millie’s cries. She stood and made her way to the crib, pulling her daughter out of it. Sitting in the chair at the desk she cooed to her daughter, pulling her close to feed. She hummed to her daughter, a tune she remembered her mother singing to her many years ago when Molly couldn’t sleep. Once Millie had finished she burped her and rocked her into sleep, setting her into the bed once more. She went into the next room over, seeking Walter. He was fast asleep in his bed and Molly just watched his chest rise and fall for a while, using the rhythmic movement to calm her. Arthur is gone. It kept bouncing around her mind relentlessly, every time she managed to push it down it would come springing back unwelcome. No matter what she had done to protect him it hadn’t worked, she wiped a tear away as it made a trail down her cheek, sucking in a deep breath. As she shifted she remembered the dull ache between her legs.Between Millie’s birth and Macnair, her body was sore. She returned to her room and dug through the bureau, pulling out both a healing potion and sleeping draught. She drank both of them before settling back into the bed, pulling the covers around her tightly. The potion seemed to take longer to take effect this time, and maybe her emotional state had something to do with that. Molly didn’t know, she hadn’t been very serious in her pursuit of knowledge when it came to potions. She had enjoyed charms and transfiguration much more during her school years. The pillow beneath Molly became saturated in tears as she fought towards sleep, the only sound audible to her ears was the quiet sobs that escaped her.

Molly set Millie onto the bed beside Walter gently, cooing to both of her children. She had just gone through the photo with Walter again, asking who each person in the photo was. His lisp had lessened over the past few months, and he was able to say most of their names clearly. She slid the pictures back underneath the mattress, taking care no to tear the fading images. Nia entered the room followed by Narcissa, who looked unnerved.“Molly, leave the children with Nia. You need to come quickly.” Molly made sure Nia had the children before she followed Narcissa out of the room, hurrying as much as her knee allowed as Narcissa made her way through the twisting corridors. They made their way to the dining room, where many of the Death Eaters were assembled. Among them, however, were some Molly had not seen since the wanted posters during the last war. Augustus Rookwood, Travers, Theodore Nott, and Mulciber were present. Molly also noticed Rodolphus’ brother, Rabastan, near the back. A young man Molly had never seen before approached her, a wide grin cracking across his face.“Name’s Stan Shunpike, ma’am. Nice to meet ‘choo.” She took his proffered hand gingerly, shaking it before letting her hand drop to her side. “See you’s gotta mark, huh? What’s a man gotta do ‘round here to receive one uv his own?” He asked, eyeing her mark hungrily. Macnair stepped around Molly, placing himself between her and Shunpike.“Prove to the Dark Lord your unwavering loyalty, Stan. Only his most trusted followers are blessed with the mark, it is a sign of respect. It is earned, not given.” Stan bowed himself away from Macnair, offering a feeble apology as he left undercut by the despise in his gaze.“Thank you, Walden.” Molly whispered. He waved it off, the two of them taking seats around the long table. At the head sat the Dark Lord, watching them all take their places. Molly’s eyes glanced around the table, settling on the faces she knew well. Narcissa and Lucius were across the table, seated much closer to the Dark Lord. Pettigrew saw a few seats further down from Molly, his eyes darting wildly around the table to the assembled Death Eaters. At the head, seated beside the Dark Lord sat Snape, his cold eyes glittering as they made their own trail around those in attendance. His eyes stopped on Molly momentarily, before continuing their indifferent sweep. Molly built her wall around her mind, enforcing it as she looked around the table in what she hoped was a bored manner. Their attention was drawn to the Dark Lord as he cleared his throat.“Welcome back, my friends. It has been many years since we stood assembled at our full mass. I am pleased to see most have returned and am curious to see how these next few years unfold. Hoe much more we may grow. I am pleased with most of you, and the roles you have played since my downfall. And to those who spent their years in Azkaban prison, my humblest apologies. But it was not in vain, my friends. No, it was well spent I promise. Those who remained free continued our work, paving the road for you to follow. And fear not about a return to Azkaban, if that were to occur there is no worry about permanency. For the dementors have taken to our cause, with their help we see some of our friends returned here today. A mass breakout from Azkaban, they are calling it. The ministry is trying to play it under the rug, that deranged criminal Sirius Black led the escape. Their denial will be their downfall. Even now, despite what we have accomplished, they refuse to believe that I have returned. As frustrating as this may be, we shall use it to our advantage. The ministry will never see us coming until it is too late, and they are ours. Soon, the ministry shall fall.” His words were met with silence as the Death Eaters looked around to each other before laughter started to erupt around the table. Bellatrix’s loud cackle pulled Molly’s attention a few spaces to her right, and forcing a laugh herself, Molly joined the noise. Macnair’s eyed her, a smile breaking across his face. Underneath the table his hand enfolded hers, squeezing encouragingly.“Before this can occur tough, there is something deep within the ministry that I seek. To secure Potter’s downfall, this item must be found. Until now, it has remained a mystery to you all, and I now ask those who do not bear my mark to leave the table. When we are finished here, your assignments will be given to you. Until then, find another place in this manor to occupy. A few around the table stood, including a very disgruntled man who appeared more beast than human. Walden leaned over to Molly, whispering in her ear.“That is Fenrir Greyback. Stay well away from him, he is savage. Enjoys turning any he can into a werewolf. Since you bear the mark, you need not fear that fate, as the punishment from the Dark Lord would be grave. But he will find other ways to enjoy you. And once he sets his sights on you, it’s a hunt for him. He will never give up.” Molly shuddered, leaning closer to Macnair as Greyback passed by them. Once the doors had shut, the Dark Lord flicked his wand, locking the doors and casting a silencing charm about the room. Molly felt something brush her feet and looked to the floor, pulling her foot back in shock as she realized Nagini was slithering under the table. The Dark Lord watched them for a few minutes, the assembled Death Eaters shifting nervously in anticipation. Finally, after taking a long sip from a goblet before him, the Dark Lord spoke.“Fifteen years ago, Severus brought to my attention a prophecy that had been made about me. It mentioned the birth of a boy who would hold the power to overthrow me. That boy was Potter. I sought him out to kill him that night in October, when my powers inexplicably failed me. I have sent some to find this prophecy in the Department of Mysteries, but alas none have been successful. No, they can only be retrieved by those who the prophecy is made about. It is too soon for me to enter so boldly into the ministry, so I have come up with another plan. I will lure the Potter boy to retrieve it for me. That is where you come in, my friends. A group of you will be waiting at the ministry for him. Once he receives the prophecy, I need you to take it from him. It is the last key in discovering how to destroy him. I am trusting you with a crucial task and I hope that you do not fail me. I have already chosen those who will participate in this mission. Rodolphus and Rabastan, you along with Bellatrix will lead this mission. Everyone else a part of this mission will follow their orders. You will lead Crabbe, Mulciber, Dolohov, Jugson, Macnair, Avery, Rookwood, Nott, and Travers. Molly, you shall be present for this mission as well, and I want complete devotion to their orders. If you are ordered to maim, you will do it. If you are ordered to kill, you will do it.” Molly nodded her understanding, gripping tightly to the skirt she was wearing. Keeping her wall present she made sure any sign of disgust was suppressed deep underneath her devotion. The Dark Lord maintained eye contact for a moment, and Molly could feel him pressing against her mind. She let him in, to see her slight hesitancy pushed down by her desire to serve him. He let out a twisted chuckle, retreating from her mind.“I see your hesitation, but also your devotion. You are coming along well, and I believe you will be a great asset to us as the war progresses. You are all dismissed.” They stood from the table, leaving the room quietly. Macnair pulled her to him, kissing her.“You did well, Molly. He does not show often that he is pleased with us, you are doing exceptionally well. I have to go; I have a mission to complete with Mulciber tonight. I will see you tomorrow, my love.” He kissed her once more, leaving her alone in the hallway. She turned and slowly made her way to the stairs, taking them carefully as not to agitate her knee. She was stopped near the top, the sudden appearance of Greyback startling her. She barely caught the railing before she fell back down the stairs, balancing herself.“My apologies.” His voice sounded more like a snarl than an apology, but Molly accepted it, pushing most of her emotions down.“Not a problem, accidents happen.” She answered lightly, trying to move around him and back up the stairs. He cut her off, smiling wolfishly towards her. “Is there anything else you need?” She asked, looking down from her step. He shook his head, picking at one of his sharp nails.“Just wondering what a fine thing like you is doing here, that’s all.” Molly nodded, pulling the dress sleeve above her arm, and showing him her Dark Mark.“In service of the Dark Lord, same as everyone else here.” She responded, pulling the hem of the sleeve back down. His eyes nearly bugged at this, looking back to Molly’s face.“I didn’t realize you were a member of the inner circle, my apologies.” His words implied regret, but his tone distain. Their attention was caught by another’s voice, one that brought relief to Molly.“Greyback you are dismissed.” Narcissa made her way up the stairs, watching Greyback retreat down them with a bowed head. Narcissa reached her, the two finishing the trek up the stairs in silence. Once they reached Molly’s room Narcissa locked the door, casting a silencing charm about the room.“So, you faced the Dark Lord and cast aside his doubts. You did very well, Molly.” Molly shook her head, sitting on the side of the bed.“Not really. I let him see the hesitation but pushed the devotion far above it. I tried to present it as I wanted to prove it to him. I am thankful he pulled away when he did, I do not know how much longer I could have held him at bay.” Narcissa took the seat at the desk.“I believe that will be his downfall, in the end. His arrogance.” They said no more on the subject of the Dark Lord, turning instead too the mission.“I will not be there, obviously, but I wanted to give you this. New masks were made, and I made sure to grab one for you. They aren’t great, but they are much better than what we wore last year.” Molly took the bundle Narcissa offered, opening it apprehensively. Inside, however, was not another human skull, but an intricate mask made out of silver. Molly sighed her relief, setting it onto the bed beside her.“I must say, these are much better than the skull masks.” Silence hung heavily between the two, the only movement in the room was the light dancing off the walls from the chandelier.“Hey, I want you to know Arthur survived. No one’s seen him since the attack, but I overheard Lucius talking to Jugson about him. Apparently he is back at work in the ministry.” Molly’s eyes remained unfocused on the window. Narcissa was unsure if she had heard her, repeating what she’d said.“No, I heard you the first time, Narcissa. I just. I’m glad, I promise, but… I just feel kind’ve numb about it. Maybe it would be better if he had died, you know? With what is to come, if the Dark Lord succeeds, there is no hope for my family. They’ve sided with Harry, with Dumbledore. If they do survive the war, they will be marked traitors and killed anyway. If he wins, their fate is sealed. And I don’t think the Death Eaters will be kind when it comes to their deaths. They enjoy torture far too much. In many ways I wish Dolohov had been successful in killing me when he used that curse. I love Millie and Walter, but this? Being here? I don’t know it was worth it. My life was stolen from me, I was stolen from my family, and now I just cannot bring myself to care anymore. I have done evil things. I am implicit in the crimes that have been committed. Even if Harry does overthrow the Dark Lord, I do not believe there is hope for you or I. We will be branded traitors. Azkaban or death. Either way, there is no winning here. One way or another, I never return to my family.” She didn’t cry this time, and the normal swell of emotions that overcame her were missing as well. She just felt numb.“Would you like to practice legilimency?” it wasn’t necessary today, after her success with the occlumency earlier, but it would give Molly some time outside of her own mind. Molly nodded, setting her wand down beside her. They had been practicing this wandless in case Molly needed to perform this at a moment’s notice, and she had been performing exceedingly well. She looked to Narcissa, wordlessly casting the spell as she focused intently on entering her mind. With practiced ease she wild in, knocking down the formidable block Narcissa offered against her. She pushed around her mind, ignoring what Narcissa was presenting her and searching deeper. Towards the back of her mind she pressed, seeking what Narcissa was hiding. Triumphantly she pushed harder, breaching through Narcissa’s façade, and penetrating the deepest parts of her mind. Memories flooded her mind, like watching her life unfold before Molly’s own eyes.Her childhood, watching Bellatrix and Andromeda grow. Her time at school, her marriage to Lucius. Draco’s hard birth, and his first steps. Watching him mature, the concern mirroring his growth as the Dark Lord returned. Her fear for Draco in what the Dark Lord planned for him. And joltingly, she was thrown back out of Narcissa’s mind and into her own. Narcissa was panting, sweat dripping down her face. Molly wiped her own brow, her hand coming away damp.“You are stronger than I thought, Molly. I could not keep you out, and it took some time to push you back. I am impressed. Soon, I think, you will be able to hold your own against anyone trying to enter your mind. Be cautious around the Dark Lord, but I do not think he is worried by you. I doubt he would search so deeply in you, when he thinks your allegiance has been won. This time I want you to put your own memories into my mind, to practice letting another see what you choose. Try again.” Molly repeated the spell, this time taking along with her the memory of watching the twin’s board the Hogwarts Express the first time. Little Ron and Ginny begging to go, and her hushing them as they waved to the train in farewell. It didn’t last long before Molly receded, exhausted. Narcissa nodded, sitting back in her chair.“We will be done for today. We are both tired, and there is still much to do. I must go talk to Lucius, but will you meet me in the dining room for dinner?” Molly nodded, relaxing back against the headboard. Narcissa left her, removing the silencing charm from the room as she went. Molly picked Millie up out of the crib, settling into the chair Narcissa had vacated. She fed her daughter, rocking her gently and humming.“I hope that the war does end well, my love. And that Arthur may take you and Walter, whatever happens to me.” Tears did come at this thought, but Molly held them back as she watched her daughter drift back into sleep. If the Dark Lord fell, her children may yet grow up in a world where she hoped they would not be condemned for her actions. No, they were innocent and did not deserve punishment for their parent’s actions. She laid Millie into the crib gently, watching her sleep for a few minutes. Once she was sure Millie would not wake, she returned to the bed. Pulling the photos out she traced the familiar lines of her families’ faces, wondering how much they had changed. How they would look now. She refrained from unfolding the photo of Arthur out. She couldn’t face seeing him. Them. The sound of the door opening startled her from her thoughts, immediately pushing the barrier up around her mind and hiding the pictures underneath her pillow. Nia entered, closing the door softly behind her.“Good evening, Mistress Molly. Mistress Lestrange asked me to give you a message.” She was wringing the hem of her pillowcase nervously, awaiting a response from Molly.“What is it, Nia?” She asked, pulling the photos out from under the pillow and returning them to their spot under the mattress. Nia didn’t respond, prompting Molly to turn and look towards her. She wouldn’t meet Molly’s eyes, her lip quivering. A noticeable burn ran across her neck, reaching up her jaw.“Mistress Molly’s place in the mission has been chosen. To remain by Mistress Lestrange’s side. To keep her eye on you.” Molly stopped, a lump forming in her throat.“Thank you, Nia.” If Bellatrix was going to be her guard dog during the mission, she was going to have to excel much further with her occlumency lessons. She would need to keep that wall well up, without having to focus on it. She returned her gaze to Nia, who was whimpering quietly in pain. Molly pulled her wand out, gesturing for Nia to come closer.“Let me heal that, Nia. Did Bellatrix do this?” Nia nodded quickly, not looking up. Unfortunately, she could not stop Bellatrix from punishing the house elf how she saw fit, but that didn’t mean Nia had to suffer for it, and she was not allowed to heal this on her own. “Reparifors.” The wound faded, leaving a discolored scar in its place.“Thank you, Mistress Molly.” She whispered, turning to take her leave. Molly sighed, sitting down slowly on the bed, pulling the pillow tight against her chest.

Molly sat waiting. She could feel Bellatrix’s eyes on her as she readjusted her mask. Bellatrix wasn’t wearing one of course, having escaped Azkaban she had no worries about people seeing her. No, she quite enjoyed watching the terror overcome her victims as they recognized her. Those whose identities needed to remain anonymous were cautious to never let their mask slip. Over the past few months Molly had gone on a few missions supervised by Bellatrix, where she had encouraged her proclivity for following orders. She doubted she would ever get the sounds of their screaming out of her head. Countless muggles had died this spring, Preparing the country, putting muggles in their rightful place, Bellatrix had said. Molly closed her eyes for a second, trying to banish from her mind the image of one mother holding tightly to her child as they died arm in arm. A noise caught her attention, the others around her shifting as well signifying they had heard it as well. They pressed themselves further into the countless shelves of prophecies, hiding amongst the shadows.The sound of footsteps reached them, softly at first but growing closer. Soft whispers met their ears and Lucius signaled them, the group breaking off into pairs silently. Molly followed Bellatrix’s lead down the center aisle. The group of children came into sight, stopping Molly’s breath and nearly stopping her in her tracks. Ron and Ginny were among the assembled. Ron was talking quietly with Harry, and a young girl she assumed was Hermione. The others among them, a tall young man with dark hair and a slight young girl with hair of near white, she did not recognize. Her eyes traced the faces of her two children, a deepening pit opening in her chest as she took them in. Both had grown taller than her now, Ron’s gangling form matched only by the other young man among them. And Ginny looked almost an entirely different person now, her face had grown slim and angular, and all of them seeming much older than she knew them to be. Taking a deep breath, she emptied her mind of all emotions aside from boredom and built her walls. The only good thing about her time with Bellatrix these last few months was the ease she now practiced this with. The group of teens caught her attention as they moved, turning down the opposite aisle and running straight into Lucius.Almost immediately the air was filled with the sound of flying spells. One Death Eater was sent flying by a spell from Ginny, and Molly had to stamp down the pride she felt as she pulled her wand to join the fight. Steeling herself she ran into the aisle chasing the children as they bolted different directions. Molly followed Bellatrix’s lead, thankful that their path led them after the two she did not know. Raising her wand Molly bit her tongue, forcing the words from her mouth.“Stupefy!” The prophecies beside the girl’s head exploded, sending glass shards in all directions. They continued their pursuit, spells fired back and forth as they passed through countless aisles. A stinging hex caught Molly in the side, doubling her over for a minute as pain rippled through her.“Get up, you stupid bitch and fight!” Bellatrix hissed, pushing Molly forward. Molly stumbled a few steps before regaining her balance and resuming her hunt for the kids. The girl had disappeared, but she quickly caught sight of the boy. She turned the aisle ahead of him, cutting him off as he broke through the end of his.“Impedimenta!” Her spell was off once again but coming much closer to hitting the boy this time. The shelf beside him broke, prophecies crashing to the floor. He took off, ducking to miss prophecies as they fell around him. As Molly ran with a hobbled limp out of her aisle another kid ran into her, stumbling back in surprise. Molly turned to face them, her blood running cold. Ginny stood before her, wand drawn and eyes burning with hatred. Molly pushed the flare of emotion back down, pointing her wand towards Ginny.“Confringo!” She hissed, lowering her voice so that Ginny would not hear it. The ground before Ginny exploded, rubble blasting in every direction. The force knocked Ginny back, rolling into a shelf. She pulled herself to her feet, looking at the shelves around her. With a dark glance towards Molly, blood dripping from a cut on her cheek, she raised her wand towards the shelf above her. She cast the same spell as Molly had, blasting the shelves apart above them. From the look in her eyes, she had misjudged the force of the spell. From nearby they heard the other kids yelling.“REDUCTO!” The cry came from all of them, as they blew apart the shelves around them in tandem. Molly fell to the ground as prophecies began to fall shattering against the ground around her, the explosion fracturing the shelves on either side of her, knocking them into one another. All around them prophecies rained down, shattering around their feet. Both of them turned and ran, Ginny outstripping Molly quickly. Once Ginny entered the main aisle she was joined by the other kids, looking for an exit. The Death Eaters entered the aisle around Molly, giving chase after them. Hermione cast a door open, all of them falling though it into a long drop. They stopped at the edge of the door, watching the children pick themselves up and walk towards an archway, whispering amongst themselves.“Come along, let us not keep them waiting. This has gone on long enough.” Lucius pushed his way forward, jumping down through the door. One by one the rest followed, Molly dropping through after Mulciber.“Arresto Momento.” Molly whispered, slowing her descent so that she landed softly on the floor. Lucius approached Harry, asking him for the prophecy. All around the room stood a Death Eater holding one of the kids in a tight grip, wands drawn. Molly’s eyes were drawn to the arch, where a faint whispering emanated from. A silvery sheen seemed to ripple in the arch, and Molly felt unease as she stepped near it. Her attention was quickly drawn back to the situation at hand as a new voice spoke.“Get away from my godson.” Molly turned to see Sirius Black standing behind Lucius, catching him hard across the jaw with his fist. All hell broke loose as Order members apparated into the room, tackling the Death Eaters who held the children hostage. Molly backed against the wall, watching the order members attack the Death Eaters. Distracted, the kids ran and joined the fray, leaping into battle. Drawing her wand Molly turned, sending a stunning spell towards a young woman with short pink hair. She caught her in the leg, the woman stumbling towards the floor. A man who stood beside her turned, grabbing her arm as she fell and caught her, leaning her against him as he faced Molly. Remus Lupin stood before her, eyes blazing as he threw a spell at Molly. The wall inches from her head exploded, rubble sailing from it and one catching the side of her head. Molly fell to her knees, barely missing another jinx sent her way. From her lower position she shot another spell, balancing herself against the wall as she stood up. Lupin had fallen to the floor, his legs useless from the jelly-legs jinx Molly had cast. Molly stood, running from the two of them and into another fight. She stood beside Bellatrix, firing spell after spell towards Kingsley Shacklebolt and the blonde girl, following Bellatrix’s slow progression forward as they pressed the two back.“Protego!” Molly shouted, casting a blocking spell just before one of Shacklebolt’s spells hit Bellatrix. Bellatrix threw an exploding charm just below their feet, knocking the two of them back and into a little gully that ringed the rocks they stood upon. Bellatrix retreated, pressing herself against the back wall and sliding through the shadows. Molly kept a few steps behind her, minding the order to stay near her. She watched Bellatrix grin as she drew her wand, pointing towards Harry and Sirius who stood beside the veil fighting together.“Nice one, James!” Not a second after Sirius spoke, Bellatrix sent a stunning spell towards him, hitting his abdomen squarely. The laugh fell from Sirius’ face as he stumbled back, falling into the murmuring archway behind him. She watched his body dissolve into the mist, disappearing from their world. She gripped her wand tightly, swallowing the thick lump in her throat as Lupin caught Harry as he fell to his knees screaming. Bellatrix backed up, cackling towards the fallen boy. She slid into the hall, wailing loudly.“I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black!” Harry pulled himself free from Lupin’s grasp, tearing off down the hallway after Bellatrix. Molly followed him, behind her the Order members who tried to follow were drawn back into battle by the remaining Death Eaters. She followed the sound of laughter back into the main atrium, where Harry had caught up with Bellatrix. He attempted to cast the Cruciatus curse on her, the screams only lasting for a second before the sound of her laughter returned.“Never cast an unforgivable curse before have you? You have got to mean it, boy!” She crowed, standing up before him. “Did you love him, Potter? My filthy traitor cousin, did you love him?” She mocked, pulling her wand from her pocket. Harry screamed, throwing a stunning spell towards Bellatrix wildly. She cast it aside easily, laughing as she sent a jet of blue light towards Harry, knocking him backwards.“Unfortunately, I cannot kill you. So do as I say Potter, and I will leave you to the Dark Lord. Hand over the prophecy, and I shall be gracious to you. Give me the prophecy!” Harry laughed, pushing himself against the wall of the fountain with a grunt. Molly made her way around them, hiding herself behind one of the floo fireplaces to watch the scene unfold. Harry began laughing, shaking his head towards Bellatrix.“The prophecy is gone, Bellatrix.” Anger flashed in her eyes, pointing her wands towards Harry in a threatening manner.“YOU LIE! TELL ME WHERE THE PROPHECY IS, POTTER!” Her shouts were near deafening, Molly throwing her hands over her ears in attempt to block them out.“I am not lying. It broke back in that chamber when I tried to help Neville. I dropped it. It broke on the rocks. Go see for yourself if you don’t believe me.” He gave her a small grin as Bellatrix screamed profanities towards him.“LIAR! Accio prophecy! ACCIO!” Nothing occurred, leaving them to sit in a heavy silence as Bellatrix awaited the prophecy to appear for her.“I told you there isn’t one, it smashed downstairs. No one heard it, go and tell your master that!” Bellatrix seemed near hysterics, screaming for forgiveness from the Dark Lord as she backed away from Harry.“Why do you call to your master, he cannot hear you!” Harry yelled. A chill passed through the air, and Molly could feel the Dark Lord’s presence among them.“So, you  have destroyed my prophecy, Potter. Months’ worth of planning went into this mission, and yet my Death Eaters still failed me. Pity.” Molly could hear the disgust in his voice as he looked towards Bellatrix, and then cast his eyes up towards where she was hiding. Molly slowly made her way out, placing herself a short distance from the others. He watched her progress, returning his focus towards Harry once Molly had stalled.“I have grown weary of your meddling, Potter. Avada Kedavra!” Above them, the lifeless statue in the fountain burst forward, knocking Bellatrix into Molly, and pinning the both of them to the ground. Molly’s mask loosened, sliding partially off her face but not fully, just enough to give her a short view of Harry and the Dark Lord.“Dumbledore.” The Dark Lord’s voice was cold, his eyes flaring as he caught sight of the old wizard. The Dark Lord cast a spell towards him, Dumbledore simply disappearing from where he stood and the spell landing harmlessly against the wall that had been behind him.“You should not have come here tonight Tom. It was foolish to do so. The Auror’s are coming.”“When they arrive, I shall be long gone. And the two of you, shall be as well.” Something caught hard against Molly’s head as another spell was blocked, sending rubble flying through the room. It took her several moments to come back to herself, her ears ringing and head spinning as she tried to focus back onto the fight. The Dark Lord lay on the floor, sopping wet as water spilled across the marble. She could hear Harry screaming, his body writhing on the floor. When he spoke, it was not his voice that came out. He begged for Dumbledore to kill him.“If death is nothing, kill the boy.” There was a moment of silence as Harry seemed to grapple with the Dark Lord before he fell convulsing towards the floor. Behind her, Molly could hear hundreds of voices droning before a dead silence hushed across them. Molly watched the Dark Lord stand before dissolving into smoke, flowing rapidly towards where she and Bellatrix were trapped. He grabbed onto the both of them, her mask slipping free as she was lifted off the ground. Face uncovered, she looked into the eyes of Albus Dumbledore as she felt them disapparate. Keeping her mental shield firmly in place, she pushed outwards violently against his mind, only pushing forward two words filled with despair. Protect them. His face remained stoic, but she saw a glimmer of dismay in his eyes before her view of the atrium disappeared entirely.The drawing room of Malfoy Manor is where the appeared, Molly and Bellatrix falling to the ground roughly. The Dark Lord stood above them, pacing angrily. Molly crawled to her knees in a bow of submission, Bellatrix throwing herself fully forward to grovel for forgiveness. He rounded on them, stopping mere inches from Molly’s face. She felt him brush against her mind and offered no resistance, baring everything before him. The only thing that was hidden was her despise for him, which she had suppressed deep below when she had awoken this morning. He probed roughly around her mind, reviewing her actions from today before pulling away harshly.“Disappointing though your performance may have been, you did follow through with the order given to you. You remained by Bella’s side, partook in the fight, though not with as much action as I would desire, but none the less you did as was asked of you. You shall receive no more punishment than what is owed for the failure of the mission. You, however, failed me spectacularly today. Your punishment, Bella, will be severe. Goyle, take her down to the dungeons. I want to you to make her scream for a while. Once you are done, leave her there. I will deal with Bella myself.” Molly was pulled roughly to her knees, forced to follow the tug at her hair in an awkward scuttle. Once they reached the stairs to the cellar he threw her, Molly bouncing down the cement steps roughly crying out at each impact. Gasping for air when she reached the bottom, she pushed herself up to her knees and back into a bowed position before Goyle as he approached her. Above her in the drawing room, she could hear Bellatrix pleading before it was caught off by a blood curdling scream. Molly swallowed, preparing herself for what was about to come. Goyle lifted his wand, grinning down to her before casting a spell.“Depulso.” Molly was thrown back, landing solidly against a cement pillar that supported the ceiling above her. She coughed roughly as she attempted to regain her breath, laying against the damp floor. “Flipendo Maxima.” Molly was forced back into the pillar at full force, she could feel bones cracking as her back flexed around the pillar. She screamed as her body relaxed, pain spiking through her back and into her limbs.“Incarcerous.” Ropes appeared around Molly, binding her tightly and digging into her skin. Goyle approached her, kicking her away from the pillar. “Incendio.” Fire burned her unbound legs, the smell of burning meat meeting Molly’s nose as she screamed, trying to thrash away from Goyle. The movement agitated her back, needle sharp pricks registering all along her spine as she moved. “Levicorpus.” Molly was pulled roughly into the air by her ankle, her bright pink skin crawling as the fire died out along it. He lifted her high into the air before dropping her, her cry echoing through the cellar as she impacted into the ground. “Obscuro.” A cloth covered Molly’s sight, wrapping around behind her head. Robbed of her sight her fear deepened, struggling harder against the ropes binding her. She could hear him approaching, stopping to lean beside her. “Sectumsempra.” She screamed hoarsely, struggling to pull away from him. He used it cleanly, leaving only a short gash across her stomach that welled blood quickly. “Vulnera Sanentur.” She felt the skin knit back together, the blood gently dripping down the side of her body before it healed fully. Above them, Bellatrix’s screaming had stopped. She felt rough hands on her, pushing the edge of her robes up and around her middle. Fingers slipped under the hem of her shirt, tugging it up underneath the ropes so that it caught above her breasts roughly. Hot hands palmed her, ripping her bra open and letting the scraps fall down the side of her body.“No! You can’t, Walden will be angry!” She begged, hoping to turn him from her body. A gruff chuckle responded, hands still kneading her roughly as he pinched her nipples sharply. She let out a gasp as she struggled to free her hands, tears springing to her eyes.“He won’t be a problem for a while, honey. Don’t you know? You and Bellatrix were the only two to return. All the others were caught in the death chamber, bound by an anti-disapparation jinx. They were turned over to the dementors this morning. They’ll be back, no doubt. But not for a while, those plans have still yet to be made. For a while, you are all mine. And I doubt the others will hold back much, when there is something good and free right here. Or do you not remember the vow you made to Walden, to listen and obey?” His voice leered as hands made their way down to her skirt. He pushed it upwards, the burnt ends drawing roughly against her blistered skin. Molly cried out, thrashing her shoulders in attempt to push him away, her hands still bound stiffly to her side. He freed himself from his clothes, wrapping his hands around her knees and pushing them apart but she was not offering any real resistance anymore. She began to cry as she felt him push against her, tears quickly soaking her blindfold. He slid into her, stalling a bit at her dryness before pressing forward in spite of it.Molly cried out roughly, tightening her legs around Goyle as he began thrusting into her. She tried to use her leg to push him back out, but only received a harsh slap for it. She tried to relax against the cold floor, her body loosening slightly around the intrusion. The pain abated, but just barely. The man above her continued his harsh pace, grasping her hips with bruising fingers. He leaned his body over hers, closing the distance between them and pressing a sloppy kiss against her lips. Molly’s stomach rolled and she pulled her head away, turning it so that her face was nearly pressed into the cement. Finally, his pace began to stutter as his breathing grew harsh, one hand reaching for her right breast while his mouth descended on the other. He bit down on her nipple as he came, his rough cry mingled with Molly’s pained scream. He pulled himself out of her still panting, pulling his clothes back onto himself.“That was damn near fantastic. I promise you, sweetheart, we will be together again before Walden comes back.” Molly laid her head back as he ascended the stairs, her breathing slowing. She listened to the slow drip of water falling from the ceiling, counting quietly as she waited for someone to come free her. It was several hours before Narcissa found Molly bound in the dark corner of the cellar.

Molly sat tiredly into a chair at the dining room table. Walden sat in the chair next to her as she worked on his table manners, Millie babbling nonsensically on the floor as she played with the wooden blocks. Narcissa joined them a few minutes later, setting a copy of the Daily Prophet onto the table. Molly glanced over to it, setting her fork back onto her plate. The date stood out to her, catching her breath. 30th of October 1996. “Today’s my birthday…” The remark was whispered, barely audible to herself. Shaking her head softly she pushed the thought away and pulled the paper towards her. 

War Declared for Wizarding World, You-Know-Who Returns

Fear has gripped the nation in the wakeof the return of You-Know-Who. In June,Ministry workers arrived in the early hoursof the eighteenth to see the grim visage ofYou-Know-Who standing over Harry Potterand Albus Dumbledore in the Atrium.Escaping, You-Know-Who caughttwo Death Eaters and fled the scene.It is unknown the identity of who the two remainingDeath Eaters are, but the rest of those who tookplace in the attack that night is safely locked awayin Azkaban prison. New details emerge as thenames of the captured are released.Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange.Lucius Malfoy. Alastair Travers.Vincent Crabbe Sr. Aiden Mulciber.Antonin Dolohov. Isaiah Jugson.Walden Macnair. Syrus Avery.Augustus Rookwood. Theodore Nott.Many on this list were believed to be still in holdingat Azkaban, raising questions about the security.Upon further search of the facility, it wasdiscovered that Prisoner Bellatrix Lestrange wasunaccounted for and was not returned in the summer. Further investigationswill be made into this situation.It is unknown what they were seekingin the ministry that night, as none of them havespoken since their capture. “That’s all they have to report after three months? Some bloody names and nothing else? Rubbish reporting that is. When things start escalating, they are going to be hit blind.” Narcissa did not speak, her eyes trained onto the dark wood if the table before her. “What is it, Narcissa? Has anything happened to Lucius?” She shook her head, tears building in her eyes.“No… No as far as I am aware, Lucius is fine. It’s Draco. The Dark Lord had him join the Death Eaters back in August but wants it to remain quiet. He has a plan for Draco.” Her voice lowered as she looked around, making sure they remained alone. Molly leaned closer towards her as Narcissa took a breath. “He has commanded Draco to kill Albus Dumbledore. He is training with Severus, and Severus has been kind to offer him protection, but I am deeply concerned for Draco… If he fails, the consequences will be severe. I am afraid Draco will not be able to complete the mission. Bella and I went to see Severus just after it occurred. He promised he would do his best to help him, but I asked him to do more. We made and Unbreakable Vow, that if Draco were not able to fulfill his orders that Severus would kill him for Draco.” She wiped away the tears that were falling. “The Dark Lord has threatened us. That he has to do it, or he will kill Lucius and I… So, Draco doesn’t have a choice. I am terrified for him, Molly.” A noise from the hallway caught their attention.Narcissa quickly dried her face, picking up her fork and quickly eating her food. Greyback entered the room, moving towards Molly when he caught sight of her. Her stomach clenched tightly as he approached, but thankfully he sidestepped her children. He approached her from behind, Molly staring intently at the plate before her. She felt a hand cup around her stomach, and his lips press against her neck. She tensed but held still as he licked the crook of her shoulder slowly, nausea pooling in her stomach. His hand slid up to her breast, fingers teasing her nipple through the fabric. Narcissa kept focused on her food as well, not reprimanding Greyback. Without Lucius or Macnair present, his aggression had become worse without high enough members to keep him in check. He pulled himself up to her ear, not bothering to lower her voice as he spoke to her.“You taste delicious. Goyle told me about your time together, and I plan to take full advantage of that body of yours. Can’t wait.” He snapped his teeth beside her ear, Molly jumping as he pulled away. He picked up a large chunk of meat off the table and left, ripping a bite out with his teeth. Molly was shaking as she set the fork down, lowering her head into her hands.“Molly, what did Goyle do to you?” Her voice held a controlled anger in it, but Molly could feel it rolling off of her in waves.“After Macnair went to Azkaban, he started… Visiting me. Using me. He knows about the Unbreakable Vow; he uses that to his advantage. Commands me to submit to him.” Narcissa slammed her fork down onto the table.“How often.”“Almost every night. And he has told others besides Greyback.”“Have they?”“Yes.“How many.”“Three others so far.” Narcissa pushed herself back in the chair, knuckles white as she gripped the edge of the table.“I am sorry. I cannot stop them, and neither can you. I will send a letter to Severus. See if he can send some potions to keep you from contracting anything. Until Macnair returns, however, I do not think there is much more I can do.”“Thank you, Narcissa.” She shook her head, releasing her grip on the table.“Do not thank me. If I had it my way they would lay dead for what they have done.” Molly reached her hand across the table and grasped Narcissa’s, squeezing it softly. Narcissa’s fingers tightened around hers before she slid her hand away. Molly turned back towards Walter, helping him to finish his breakfast. The door opened once more, and Nia poked her head in. She approached the table, bowing low before the two women.“Mistress Molly, Master Greyback has requested your presence in your room.” Her voice trembled, as well as her legs as she stood out of her bow and made her way from the room. Molly looked down to the table, tears springing in her eyes.“Narcissa, will you watch them for me?” Narcissa nodded, her face more pale than usual. Molly stood and kissed Walter on the head, ruffling his dark curls softly as she left. She made her way around Millie, doing the same to her red tuft of hair before making her way back to her bedroom. She limped slowly down the hallway, hoping to prolong the walk but too soon she found herself standing before the heavy wooden door to her room. She pushed the door open softly, stepping into the room. Greyback stood looking through her bureau, a pair of her knickers in hand. He looked over to her and pressed them against his nose, inhaling deeply.“Smells as sweet as you do.” His grin sickened her, but her focus was drawn to another in the room. Goyle stood beside her bed on the opposite side, leaning against the wall.“Lovely to see you again.” Molly felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand as she backed towards the door slowly. Goyle tsked her, waving her to come closer. Hesitantly she moved forward towards the bed, her legs stiff.“We thought we might have a little extra… fun.” Molly looked between the two, her eyes widening.“No! That is absolutely disgusting!” She pulled away from Goyle’s outstretched hand. He lowered it, his tone taking a dangerous edge.“I am a marked member, Molly. Your orders were to do as I say. Now strip yourself of clothes and lay down.”. Molly started crying, her trembling fingers worked on the buttons of her dress. She slid it off, feeling the eyes of the two men roam her body. Pushing the emotions deep within her she dropped the dress, working to remove her undergarments. Once she was bare before them she pulled the quilt back on the bed, laying as he commanded. Both of them bade quick work of their clothes, settling to join her. Greyback pulled her face towards his, kissing her deeply as Goyle’s hands worked down the path his eyes had trailed. She gasped as he pinched her nipple roughly, biting down onto her shoulder. Greyback moved his way down her body, pushing her legs apart as his head descended on her. She bucked when she felt his tongue run over her clit, causing him to press her hips firmly down onto the bed and hold her there. Goyle pushed himself into a kneeling position, pressing himself roughly against her lips. Molly swallowed the bile rising in her throat and opened her mouth, enveloping Goyle in it.They stayed in this position for a few minutes, the only change being Molly’s movements as Greyback continued his assault on her slit. Despite the disgust she felt, her body was reaction to the stimulation. She pulled away from Goyle for a minute, letting out a shuddered moan as she came. Greyback slid back up her body, kissing her once more. She could taste herself on his lips. Goyle moved further down her body to replace Greyback, two fingers sliding into Molly as Greyback pushed himself into her mouth. Molly gripped the back of his thighs as he thrust into her mouth sharply, making her gag. He laughed above her, pressing her further down onto himself. She could feel Goyle adding a third finger and pushing into her faster, hooking his fingers up and sending her still sensitive body towards a second orgasm. She cried out around greyback, careful not to bite down on him as she came. Both men pulled away from her body, pulling her down the bed a bit.Goyle lay on his back, gesturing for Molly to mount him. She moved her way up his body, the muscles between her legs still clenching from her orgasm. She mounted him gently, easing down until he filled her. She hissed a bit before moving forward, bouncing on him softly. She was just finding a rhythm when she felt Greyback behind her. He reached around to her mouth, pushing his fingers past her lips. She sucked on them for a moment before he pulled them away with a quiet pop and withdrew his hand from her vision. It didn’t take her long to figure out where he was placing them as she felt spit slick fingers against her backside, pressing upward against her.“Please, no. Not there!” Her cry was unheeded as he pushed his finger into her, groaning at how tight she was around his finger.“After Rodolphus told me about what he did with you, I knew I would have to try it.” His whisper was low in her ear as he licked down the side of her neck, sucking dark red marks into her skin. She tensed as he probed a second finger inside of her, pumping them in and out slowly. She groaned heavily at the feeling, pain radiating through her hips and up her back. He removed his fingers, and she heard him spit behind her. She started crying as Goyle encouraged her to continue moving, the pressure of a heavy head pressing against her backside. He pressed into her mid thrust, Goyle pushing her hips down and onto Greyback. She screamed as he penetrated her, black specs dancing in her vision. They gave her a second to adjust, not nearly long enough, before they continued their thrusting. Goyle lifted her up as Greyback thrust into her, and despite the intense pain of the movements from behind her, she felt nerves lighting up she had never known of before. Her pained gasps soon slid into pleasured moans as the two men rocked her between them, Greyback’s hands finding her breasts and twisting her nipples gently.Goyle’s slid his hand off her hip and to where they were joined, rubbing over her clit softly. She cried out bending over Goyle’s chest and biting his shoulder gently as pleasure coursed through her body. Somewhere in the back of her mind she felt disgust, towards both herself and the two men but it was buried deep beneath the lust as they urged her to move faster. Goyle’s lips found her throat, sucking on the pulse point on her neck and sending her headfirst into another orgasm. She cried out, her body falling limp against Goyle’s as the two men continued their thrusts inside of her. She felt Greyback stutter for a second before increasing his pace, the sound of him slapping against her growing louder. Goyle began rotating his hips beneath her, pressing against her sensitive nerves in a new way. Breathless, Molly came one last time uttering only a choked scream. Goyle wrapped his free hand around her back, helping to push her up for leverage as he thrust inside of her. Greyback’s pace became erratic before stalling altogether, him leaning over her back and howling as he finished. She felt him soften inside of her before slipping out, rolling off her back and laid breathless on the bed. Goyle’s hips began to stutter as well and with a low moan he came, leaving bruising imprints on Molly’s back. He rolled her off the top of him, leaving her exhausted on the damp sheets as he pulled himself from the bed.He went into the bathroom and cleaned himself before returning for his clothes, tossing Greyback’s to the now dozing man. He dressed and left quietly, not a word of acknowledgment towards Molly. Greyback, having awoken at the clothes landing on him stood and dressed, leaving her alone in the room as he shut the door behind him. Molly laid in the bed for a while, too tired to move much from her position. She pulled the quilt over her and fell into a dreamless sleep.When she woke, it was much later in the afternoon. The sun hung on the edge of the hills; the chilly winter evening stained a deep orange color. It was a rare, cloudless sunset for the area. Molly stretched her muscles and slid out of the bed, casting a cleaning charm over the sheets as she stood. She walked into the bathroom and filled the tub, sinking her sore body into the hot water. Rinsing her skin of the sweat and stench of the other men she slid beneath the water, the world around her becoming muffled. When her lungs burned she sat back up, pulling the bar of soap off the edge of the tub, and washing her body and hair. Once she was clean she stood, emptying the tub, and taking a towel off of the counter. Wrapping it around her body she made her way back into the room and to the wardrobe, pulling another dress off of a hanger. She placed her undergarment on followed by the dress, towel drying her hair softly. She set the clothes from earlier into a basket and returned to the bed, sitting on the side of it. A knock drew her attention to the door and Narcissa edged it open, poking her head in.“Oh, you are finally awake.” She pushed the door further open, Millie resting on her hip and hand in Walter’s. She brought them into the room, setting Millie gently onto the floor before helping Walter into the bed with Molly.“How are you feeling?” Molly knew she wasn’t looking for an in-depth answer, and she didn’t feel like oversharing what had occurred this morning.“Not well. But better now that I have bathed.” Narcissa did not respond as she took a seat at the desk, drawing the chair around so that she was facing Molly.“We have a surprise for you.” She was smiling now, before waving to the still open door. Nia entered the room, holding a small cake with candles alight on top of it. Molly sat back against the headboard of the bed, smiling as Nia closed the door behind her and made her way across the room with a cake. They had done this for Walter as his birthdays as they came, but in her time here she had never celebrated hers. For the most part, she just never knew what day it was. This past year she had worked harder to keep a track of the passing days, since now her children had birthdays to celebrate. Nia brought the cake to Molly, setting it on the bedside table for her to blow the candles out. Taking a deep breath she extinguished them, Walter leaning over to help her blow them out. Nia snapped her fingers, a loud CRACK emitting as plates and silverware appeared on the table beside the cake. She carefully cut slices out of it, handing one to Molly and one to Narcissa.“Nia, I want you to take a small slice as well, please.” Nia nodded her head, taking a thin sliver from the cake and sitting on the floor to eat it. Narcissa picked Millie up off of the floor and set her on the bed beside Walter, taking a seat at the foot end of the bed. Molly shared her slice with Walter and fed small bites to Millie, the little girls eyes lighting up at the sweet treat. Molly closed her eyes enjoying a bite of the chocolate cake before they snapped open in surprise. The door slammed open, Bellatrix standing in the archway.“Bella, what are you doing here?” Narcissa asked, standing to face her sister.“Hello, Cissy. I don’t need you, move out of my way. I am here for her.” She made her way around the bed as Molly set her plate down, standing to put herself between Bellatrix and her children.“What is it, Bellatrix?” Molly inquired, stepping back as Bellatrix drew her wand.“Our master is pleased with your service, Molly, but even he is disappointed with your performance. When we go out on missions, we need more effort on your end. When you cast spells, you aim wide to take out objects around them, not the target themselves. And the spells you are using are juvenile. Our orders are to kill any who stand in our way, aside from Potter, but you have made no effort to do so. So, he asked me to punish you really quick, remind you of your orders. Crucio.” She cackled as Molly fell to the ground screaming. Narcissa made her way to the children who began to cry as Molly writhed on the ground. Every nerve felt as if she were being shocked as she convulsed on the ground. Bellatrix held the curse for several moments, before Narcissa spoke.“Enough, Bella. If you hold the curse any longer you risk damaging her mind. That would not please the Dark Lord!” At the mention of her master Bellatrix pulled her wand back, relinquishing the curse over Molly. She rolled onto her side gasping for air, curling in on herself tightly. She shook as Bellatrix kneeled beside her, hissing into her ear.“There will be no more mercy when it comes to this.” She pulled a knife out of her robe, tracing it across Molly’s face. Digging it into her cheek she pulled it down, cutting Molly’s skin open wide. She screamed as Bellatrix continued downwards, cutting across her lips and down to her chin. With that, she stood and left the room, shutting the door loudly behind her. Narcissa knelt beside Molly, helping her into a sitting position as she tried to regain her breath. Narcissa cupped a hand over the bleeding, pulling her wand to heal it.“Vulnera Sanentur.” The skin pulled back together, leaving an angry scar. “Scourgify.” The blood disappeared from her as Molly placed her hand over her freshly scarred face.“I am so sorry about this, Molly.” She waved her off, pushing herself up to stand.“Nothing you can do about it, no point in apologizing. You aren’t the one hurting me.” She ignored Narcissa’s look of concern, turning to comfort her children. Walter had stopped crying at this point, but still hiccoughed as he watched Molly approach. Millie was still wailing, only ceasing when Molly pulled her into her arms. She made room for Walter as well, settling him back onto her lap.“Now, where were we?” She asked, pulling the plate of cake back towards her and giving a small bite to both her children. Narcissa watched on sadly, frustrated that there was nothing she could do to protect Molly. Sitting back down onto the bed she watched Molly interact with her children, moved by her desire to comfort her children despite her pain.

Molly made her way through the cold streets, following Narcissa. They had been called to meet in London, where they were going to perform attack on muggles. Turning a corner into an alley, they were met by several others. Selwyn turned to face them, frowning as they came around the corner and into his sight.“I am aware we are late, Selwyn. We were caught up in a sweep of muggles, took us a minute to break free of them. Don’t exactly blend into a crowd dressed like this.” Molly gestured to the robes she was wearing. “Honestly, though, do you never smile?” She quipped gently. He shook his head and turned back to the group, addressing them.“We are all here. Let the fun begin!” He jeered, turning back out of the alley. The other Death Eaters placed their masks over their faces, following him out into the bustling street. As soon as they were spotted, several muggles began to back away, eyeing the crowd of Death Eaters warily.“What’s this? Some sort of demonstration?” One man asked, moving a step forward towards them. Bellatrix pulled her wand, killing him where he stood. As his body fell to the ground screams erupted around them as the people gathered to watch took off running in every direction. Molly pulled her wand and followed closely to Narcissa, cursing muggles. She had not been able to successfully perform a killing curse in her time with them, Bellatrix’s taunting words ringing in her ears every time she had attempted. Never cast an unforgiveable curse before? You’ve got to mean it, boy! She shook her head gently before casting the Cruciatus curse towards an older woman. She fell to the ground screaming as Molly withdrew the curse and moved on. By the time they reached the end of the street it had emptied considerably, only a few stragglers making their way down alleyways. Narcissa sent a killing curse towards a young man, hitting him in the center of his back. He fell soundlessly, only the thud of his body hitting the cobbled street marking his fall. Molly looked behind them, taking in all the bodies that lay unmoving.She followed Narcissa down onto another road where people were still assembled but were dispersing as they watched them approach. Molly cast Sectumsempra at one young woman, a deep gash welling up along her legs. She fell to the ground screaming, but it was quickly silenced by the trampling feet that ran over her in attempt to get away. Walking over the dead woman’s body she continued her path down the street, lighting shops on fire as she passed them. As they came out onto the edge of the Thames, she could see several other Death Eaters standing below the bridge that spanned it, firing spells up towards the cables that suspended the bridge over the water. With a twisting groan the cables began to snap, dropping sections of the walking bridge into the cold water below. Screams could be heard for blocks around them as they continued to make their way through the crowds, firing spells blindly into them and watching muggles fall. As they neared another building Molly shattered all of the glass out of the shop windows before sending jets of fire into the display racks. She turned away and caught up with Narcissa, who slowed her pace for Molly’s limp. Once they reached the park they set their wands away, waiting for the others to arrive. One by one other Death Eaters assembled around them in the park, the sound of sirens reaching their ears.Just as Bellatrix joined them, gleefully singing as she waltzed around the corner and into the clearing, several police cars pulled screeching into the park as well. They opened their doors and drew small metal devices that were completely foreign to Molly, yelling for them to drop their weapons. Taking their cue to leave, Molly grasped Narcissa’s arm and they disapparated together. They dropped to the ground before the gates of Malfoy Manor and made their way quickly up the path to the house.“How are you feeling? I know that apparation affects you, and with the pregnancy it must be terrible.” Molly sighed as they entered the door, removing their masks and cloaks.“I’ll be fine in a minute. The morning sickness is worst in the evening, and apparation only affects me for a minute or so.” They made their way into the warm corridors of the manor, making their way to the dining room. Nia sat with Millie on the floor watching her, as Walter ate quietly at the table. Molly sat beside him, Narcissa taking the seat to her left. They pulled plates of food towards them, picking bits of food from the array before them. Molly’s mind drifted to her pregnancy, and the most pressing concern to her with it. She had no idea who the father was, but at this rate she couldn’t seem to care. As long as it was not Greyback’s child, she thought she could handle it. If it were, however, it carried the risk of passing his Lycanthropy to her child. She took a bite of her food, watching Walter take small bites of his food which had thankfully been cut up for him.“Thank you, Nia. For watching the children for me.” Nia stood from her spot beside Millie and headed towards the door.“Of course, Mistress Molly. I am going to perform my tasks if that is alright with you.” Molly nodded and waved to Nia as she left. As they ate other Death Eaters joined them and sat to eat. Greyback sat across from her, watching her eat. Molly kept her gaze lowered to the table as she ate. Silence fell over the assembled Death Eaters as the Dark Lord entered, taking a seat at the head of table. With a flick of his wand the food cleared away from the table, leaving the dark wood to reflect the light from the candles above.“Call the others to me, please. And Molly, take your children out. Return once you are finished.”“Yes, My Lord.” She stood and gathered her children, taking them to Walter’s room. Nia was changing the sheets as she entered, bowing low as Molly set the children on the floor with their toys.“I need you to watch them a little while longer, Nia. The Dark Lord has called us to a meeting.” At her words the mark on her arm flared in pain, signaling her need to return. Molly left the children in the room and returned to the dining room, sitting beside Narcissa once more. Once all the remaining Death Eaters in the inner circle were assembled, Molly finding relief in Greyback’s exit, the Dark Lord spoke.“Unfortunately, it seems, Dumbledore has discovered the secret of my Horcruxes. I could feel as he destroyed one. Thankfully, the others are hidden enough that I do not believe they will be discovered. No, I know I have hidden them well and am not concerned about this matter. On another topic, the breakout from Azkaban will take place in June. While that is taking place, I want a team of you to enter Hogwarts as well. At the end of the semester, Draco Malfoy will kill Albus Dumbledore. For this, I want Alecto and Amycus to lead. Fenrir, Corbin, Gibbon, and Rowle will join. I do not want Severus to participate, as I need his cover to remain so that he may take over as headmaster of Hogwarts once Dumbledore is dead.” A raucous laughter arose around the table, as the selected Death Eaters smirked at their placement in this mission.“Once Dumbledore is dead, we will have claimed Hogwarts. The Potter boy will be withing my reach finally.” Another round of laughter, Bellatrix’s cutting across all the others. “Once the rest of our members return to us, the ministry will fall soon after. Even now they are crumbling under the weight of open war. Once the time comes, Pius will take over as Minister of Magic.” He gestured to a man Molly had never seen before, who let a little bow at his mention. “Pius Thickness has joined us from the ministry, under the Imperious curse of course, thanks to the talented work of Corbin.” Another round of laughter, Molly joining in quietly. “Now, my friends, is the final days of our work from the shadows. This summer we shall emerge and take the country.” Applause burst out around the table.“The rest of you have your missions for this month. You did well today, my friends. Panic has already grasped tightly across the nation. Magical and muggle alike are hiding, waiting for our next move. Yes, the road has been paved. You are dismissed.” Around the table people stood, leaving the dining room. The Dark Lord collected Nagini, making his way out and down a corridor through the back door. Molly and Narcissa left, returning to Walter’s room.“Thank you, Nia, for watching them.” Nia bowed lowly, leaving the room with a CRACK. “What do you think he does in his spare time?” Molly asked, shutting the door behind them. Narcissa closed her eyes, shuddering.“I do not want to know.” She responded, shaking her head.“Do you think he reads or, like, just pace his room muttering ‘Potter’ as he fumes.” Narcissa chuckled lightly, sitting against Walter’s bed. Molly sat down beside Walter who was playing quietly with Millie, handing blocks back and forth between her.“Your children are well behaved. I do not think I have witnessed two children play so peacefully before.”“Yes, I am very lucky with them. But I think that their environment has a factor in that, because at the Burrow I thought my children would kill each other or set the house on fire all the time.” She let out a laugh, accepting a block from Walter. “Thank you, honey.” He handed another block to Millie, taking one she handed to him. Her hair had grown longer over the last few years, now curling gently below her ears. Her eyes had darkened as Molly expected, her own brown looking back at her. She looked a lot like Ginny had, aside from her nose that matched Walden’s. Her mind wandered back to the paternity of her unborn child, her hand moving to rest softly on her stomach. Walter moved over to her, laying a hand just above hers.“Mumma gonna have anoder baby?” He asked, rubbing her belly gently.“Yes, Walter, Mumma’s going to have another baby.” She answered, pulling him in for a hug. He hugged her back tightly, before pulling away to play with Millie again.“Millie, Mumma’s gonna have anoder baby. You are gonna be a big sister!” Millie stared blankly at Walter. Molly laughed, handing another block to both of them. Walter began stacking his set of blocks, helping Millie to do the same. Molly looked at the clock on the wall, noticing the time.“It is time for bed, you two.” She picked Walter up, taking him to the bureau and pulling a set of nightclothes out.“Goodnight, Molly.” Narcissa stood to leave waving to Millie as she walked by.“Goodnight, Narcissa. Sleep well.” Narcissa returned the sentiment, closing the door behind her. Molly dressed Walter for bed, tucking him in gently. She sat beside him, stroking his hair gently as she sang him to sleep. She watched him fight it, eyes drooping gently as he lost the battle. Once he was asleep she made her way to Millie, picking her up. As she left the room she used her wand to extinguish the candles, darkening the room. She took Millie to hers, dressing her for bed as well and changing her cloth diaper. She laid Millie into the crib, humming softly as she closed her eyes and fell asleep right away. Not feeling tired herself as it was only eight o’clock, Molly made her way out towards the library. It was a room she had not visited often in her time here, but she missed the feeling of losing herself in a book. Unfortunately, as she scanned the massive shelves, they all seemed to contain the history of wizarding Europe, family trees, pro pureblood views, or were in languages Molly did not know. Pulling one off the shelf about the witch trials during the 1200’s Molly cracked open to a random page and began reading. The section she pulled open to was not one she expected, considering the other books on the shelf. For the past thirty years I havewatched the burnings of manyclose friends and even a fewfamily members of my own.And I cannot help but to wonderif maybe their may one daybe a world where this is not theonly outcome. It doesn’t seem so strangeto me, that we could live in harmony withone another. Even now, as I try to forgetthe screams of my sister I look and seemy cousin makes friendswith the muggle boy up the street.Sure, the child was born without magicso she never has to fear the flamesBut I believe that we are not so different,that muggle and me. No, I dream of afuture where we do not need to hide.But not as gods will we lord overthem, no. Hand in hand we will walk,making a better world for us all.An excerpt from the diary ofClíodhna, an Irish witchwho would face the stake herselfnot a year after this was written. Molly lowered the book gently into her lap, leaving a finger to mark the page as she shut the book. Seven hundred years, and yet views still have not changed. She was pulled from her thoughts as the door to the library opened. Molly crouched low in her seat, waiting to see who had entered. Narcissa waked out from behind a shelf, her back turned to her as she scanned the volumes silently.“Couldn’t sleep either, huh?” Narcissa jumped, turning to see where Molly was. She relaxed as her eyes fell onto the other woman, turning her back towards the shelf again and pulling an ancient tome off of the shelf, written in Latin.“No. Too much happened today, my mind won’t allow me to rest. What did you find to read?” She asked, setting herself into a chair beside Molly. Molly looked down to the book she held, before offering Narcissa the book with the marked page open. Narcissa read it slowly, sighing as she finished. “Do you know, I used to think blood purity meant everything. You have opened my eyes to that, and I thank you for this Molly. I do not think we would die out if we began marrying muggles, and the inter family marriages that continue to persist makes the blood pool smaller and smaller, not larger. And I think that the world has changed, for the better. We may have just destroyed any chance of magical and non-magical cooperation though. The Dark Lord views the muggles as less than. But as I watched them today, running and screaming, I realized. They are exactly the same as us. Living their lives, though without magic. But they are still human, and not to be looked down upon for the circumstance of their birth. If the Dark Lord fails, I hope that is the direction the world takes. Because after what we have done, and what we still have to do, I cannot see how the Ministry would wipe the memory of magic from the non-magical world.”Molly flicked through a few more pages of the book, but it seemed most of the passages were accounts of the suffering of wizard-kind under the hands of muggles and took the perspective of pro-magic rulership of Europe. Tearing the page out gently, to not damage those around it, she folded it into a small square and pocketed it.“Must you deface my property, Molly?” Narcissa asked, looking up from her ancient text.“Well, I could leave it in there for someone else to find. A nice bit of pro cooperation propaganda.” Narcissa chuckled quietly.“No, perhaps it is better to remove it then. Just make sure that it is hidden well, please. It won’t look good if they find it amongst your things, either.” Molly waved her off, returning the book to its place on the shelf.“Yeah, I know. I have hidden many things from them, this isn’t the first and it will not be the last.” Narcissa perked up at this, closing her book and setting it aside on the table in front of her chair.“Speaking of keeping things hid, how has your time with Bellatrix gone? Aside from that night on your birthday, of course.” Molly returned to her seat and settled comfortably.“Much better. The threat of any of my thoughts being known at a moment’s notice was helpful in maintaining the block at all times, as well as allowing others in when they seek. She hates me, sure, but she has no reason to doubt me. It has become second nature. As well as delving into other’s minds. Though, I would not suggest reading those of any of the men around here. They are all overflowing with filth.” She wrinkled her nose, shaking her head. Narcissa laughed.“I have seen more than I ever want to with them, yes. I do not delve in their minds unless I need to know something. But be careful with Bellatrix, she is very powerful with occlumency. She cannot distinguish very well, of course. She always took a more… Direct approach. Bashing her way into other’s minds and reading through their panic. But if you are practiced, and used to that sort of intrusion, she cannot perceive truth from lie as long as you present it as truth. Thankfully the Dark Lord seems to have that in common. He rarely looks deeper beyond what you present because he sees himself as infallible, that no follower of his dare lie to him. His arrogance may be his downfall.” Her last words were whispered, looking towards the door. Molly followed her gaze, but upon seeing no one there returned hers to Narcissa.“Always keep an eye out for Pettigrew. That little rat is fueled by fear, but it makes him very valuable to the Dark Lord. That is the only reason he is actually marked as an inner circle member. He will bring anything he sees that may boost him in the Dark Lord’s favor, regardless of the consequences for the other. That is why he sold out the Potter’s, because he found someone bigger to hide behind.” Narcissa looked to the clock standing on the wall, picking up her book and returning it to the shelf. “Now come, it is late Molly, and much more appropriate timing for bed.” Molly followed Narcissa out of the room, breaking away from her at the staircase.“Just remember, Molly. Trust no one here.” With a gentle squeeze to Molly’s hand, she turned and made her way up the stairs and out of sight.

Molly woke suddenly, looking around the dark room. At first, she didn’t know what had drawn her from sleep, but as she sat there looking out the window, she heard it again. In the distance, she could hear shouting. Throwing the quilt back, placing her feet onto the carpet. She dressed quickly, tossing her nightclothes haphazardly onto the bed behind her as she ran from the room. Squeezing her wand tightly and made her way down the hall. Too late, she realized she had never slipped her shoes on. The shouting was coming from the drawing room, where she recognized Bellatrix’s voice as the sleep that was clouding her mind dissipated. She entered the room to see most of the Death Eaters assembled, Amycus and Alecto hugging each other and Rowle slapping Greyback heartily on his shoulder. Snape stood in the corner watching the interaction, his eyes cold as he turned to sit in the corner. Draco was in the room as well, once he made eye contact with Molly he turned and left, slamming the door behind him. Narcissa made her way over to Molly, pulling her aside.“Narcissa, what the hell has happened?” She had an idea based on who was in the room, and the reactions of the others, but it was something she did not want to believe.“Draco killed Dumbledore. The school has been taken. The losses were minimal, on either side. Gibbon died, but those were the only two deaths. Draco completed his task and is safe.” Molly felt a brush against her mind and allowed Narcissa to enter. She was met with the visual of something else than Narcissa had told her. Instead of Draco casting the killing curse, Snape was the one to cast the spell. Moments after, the rest of the Death Eaters broke into the Astronomy Tower, to see Dumbledore fall to the ground far below. Retreating, Narcissa maintained eye contact with Molly for a moment. Molly nodded her head softly, not speaking. Snape stood from his chair and made his way over to her, pulling her aside.“We need to talk, Molly. Come with me.” She followed him out of the room and down the hall, entering a small spare room once he felt they had put enough distance between themselves and the others. “Muffliato.” The noise from down the hall silenced, leaving only the noises they made to fill the air. “I see Narcissa has taught you occlumency and legilimency. You are fairly gifted, but I must impress upon you the direness of anyone discovering that. Keep yourself well maintained.” Molly opened her mouth to ask how he knew, but he cut her off quickly.“I am much more gifted than Narcissa or Bella if you could call Bella’s use of occlumency a gift. No, I am even more talented than the Dark Lord when it comes to this. Very few are able to see into my mind, and everyone’s minds are open to me. I will not share your secret; this is not intimidation or anything of the sort. No, this is about the attack at the ministry last year. I wanted to let you know that Dumbledore received your message, and he has done what he can about protecting your family. Now that he is gone, however, I do not know that the protection will stand. I told him the circumstance of your entrapment here, and he decided that we would not act on trying to pull you free. With the Unbreakable Vow in place, it would be far too dangerous. However, should Potter succeed, all attempts will be made to rescue you and break you from the vow.” Molly sat against the bed, taking in Snape’s words.“Thank you, Severus.” Her voice sounded hollow. “Does… Does Arthur know? Or the children?” Snape shook his head.“No. We thought it best that the children do not know, to not be burdened with that knowledge. As far as Arthur, it was decided to be too risky. That if he knew you were alive, he would do anything to save you. It would present a danger to both himself and you, as well as provide opportunity for the Death Eaters to extract information from a member of the Order. No, it was far too dangerous to let him know you were alive. But Molly, it is almost over.” His eyes fell to her protruding stomach, sighing. “I am sorry, Molly. But we are very close to the end of this war. Just hold out a little longer.” Molly snorted, looking Severus in the eyes.“Just hold out a little longer? Do you know the things I have done here, Severus, in order to protect my children, my husband, from Death Eaters?” She let snippets of memories from the last five years to play. She could see the boredom in his eyes replace with horror as she skipped over her torture, her crimes, and the things that the Death Eaters had done to her. He stepped back, closing his connection to her mind.“I am so sorry, Molly. I cannot imagine living through those things. I will make sure that, should the Dark Lord fall, it will be made clear you were not responsible for your actions. And maybe, they will let you go home.” Molly shook her head, standing. Her voice rose, on the verge of breaking.“Severus, there is no going home for me! You have the cover of a double spy, an agent for the Order. All I am, is a desperate woman who sold her soul to save her children. It was still a choice.” Severus sighed, grasping her shoulder gently.“Yes, but remember, Molly. I was responsible for the deaths of the Potter’s by giving the Dark Lord the prophecy. And I committed many, more horrible crimes than you have during the first war. You, whose heart is pure enough you cannot cast the killing curse though you have tried, proves that you are not evil. You only commit those crimes in order to protect your children, and that is understandable even to me, though I have never loved another in that way. I promise that you will not pay for your crimes. Dumbledore has set something aside for those who were coerced, whether through the Imperious Curse or through other means, to serve the Dark Lord. I promise you will be ok.” Molly stepped away from him silently.“If. If Harry succeeds. If he fails, this is my life.” She stepped away, walking to the door. “Thank you anyway, Severus.” She opened the door and left, making her way back to the drawing room. She was making her way towards Narcissa when she was stopped, a brief moment of panic swelling through her when she laid eyes on Macnair. She knew that the escape from Azkaban had been planned for this month, but she hadn’t been given any details about it. He made his way over to her, eyes burning.“I have been gone a year, and I come home to find you pregnant?” His tone was dangerous, and Molly stepped beck as terror coursed through her veins. Narcissa’s attention was caught at this, which had been previously devoted to Lucius who was looking very pale, his once smooth face now covered in a scraggly beard. His eyes were drawn to the confrontation as well, as those nearby the two hushed their conversations, eyes drifting to Macnair. Molly placed her hand over her stomach as she backed into the wall behind her. She was spared from explaining, as the last person she expected to defend her stepped forward.“Now, now, Walden. Do not be angry with her, or do you not recall? You commanded her to obey the orders Death Eaters give her. You never gave her a way around certain orders. Or did you expect for these lowlifes to not act upon such opportunity? I may not know Molly as well as others here do, but I do doubt she is the type of woman to lay herself before just any man. Maybe you should be asking those who remained here this last year what they did to her, not what she did with them.” Silence met Lucius’ words as Macnair looked back towards Molly. He calculated his next words, his voice lowering.“Did they command you to?” She refused to look him in his eyes, focusing her gaze onto the floor. Her voice tremored as she answered him.“Yes sir.” A tear slid down her cheek as he stepped towards her, and she flinched as a hand cupped her cheek gently. His thumb traced a light path down the scar on her down across her lips.“Who.” His voice had changed, now holding a hint of sadness in the anger. She relaxed into his embrace as he wrapped his arms around her, pulling her into a hug. “Who did this to you?” She shook her head, sobbing. “Molly, tell me.”“Goyle was the first. The night of the infiltration for the prophecy… He was the most frequent… Selwyn… Yaxley… Rowle… And… And Greyback. That was it, though. They commanded me to… I… I didn’t w-want t-to! The scar, though, that was Bellatrix.” Her legs collapsed underneath her, Macnair catching her and holding her up.“Sshhh, Molly. It’s okay.” He petted her hair softly as she cried, holding her close to him. He shifted her in his arms so that he could look towards the others assembled, eyes burning.“I want to make something very clear to all of you. The point of that command was to obey orders given about missions. To serve the Dark Lord. NOT TO PLEASURE YOURSELVES WITH MY WIFE!” The named Death Eaters bowed their heads, looking away. A lone chuckle sounded into the silence, emanating from Greyback. Macnair let go of Molly, turning to face him. “You forget your place, Greyback. I cannot touch them, for their position amongst us. But you, you are fair game. You are lowly amongst us, and I can punish you.” The smirk left the werewolf’s face, anger flashing across it.“You dare threaten me?” He snarled, moving closer towards Macnair. Macnair held his ground, looking down his nose towards Greyback.“Yes. Because you, I can kill without repercussions.” Greyback bit out a growl before turning his back on Macnair and stalking out of the room. Now that the confrontation was over the others returned to their conversations, voices humming in the air. Macnair returned to Molly’s side, pulling her close. “It’s alright, Molly. This was not your fault; you are not in trouble.” She pulled away from him, looking into his eyes.“What about my child?” She asked. He sighed, leaning against the wall beside them.“It will be born soon, no? I think I will claim it. It is no more responsible than you are. No, the child will bear the name of their siblings.” Molly sighed in relief taking a seat nearby, her hand protectively cradling her swollen belly. Rodolphus entered the room, calling everyone’s attention. Once he had silence, he began.“Now that Hogwarts has fallen, the ministry is next. We will take it over at the end of July, our dear friend Pius taking the role as Minister of Magic. Scrimgeour will lay dead before the first of August. The night it falls, we will attack the house the Potter boy is staying at. Right now, we have intel that he is being moved. One tells us it will be a week before his birthday, the other on. Either way, we will be ready. We have teams in place to attack and kill him. If it fails, we know where he will be. The safe house they have chosen is the Weasley’s house in Ottery St. Catchpole.” His eyes glittered as he flicked his gaze to Molly before continuing. “We do not have orders to kill anyone there, just capture him. If we must wait to take him there, we will attack on the night of the thirty-first of July. Right in the middle of the wedding. Bill Weasley is marrying the French witch from the Delacour family, and a large mass of magical folk will be there. There is no doubt Potter will be present. By August, this will be over.”Loud applause met Rodolphus’ words, but Molly only felt sick. Her son was marrying, and she was taking part in the plans to hurt destroy his wedding. Macnair set his hand on her shoulder, drawing her attention to him.“You will not take place in the attack of the wedding, I promise.” She laid her hand against his arm sadly. She wondered where she would be now if things had been different. What the girl Bill was marrying was like, what plans she would be pulling together for the wedding. She wondered if any of her other children were in relationships, or what jobs they had chosen. The twins should be out of school, now. She knew those two were destined for something big, despite her attempts to dissuade them from jokes. If anyone could manage to make a living out of it, she had no doubts it would be them. Rodolphus left the room, signaling the end of the meeting. Macnair helped Molly out of the chair, walking her back to their bedroom. It was just the early hours of the morning, and she could see the moon hanging lowly in the sky a bare scratch across the pitch black. The stars were beautiful, smattered behind the moon shining in the night.“Molly, I promise that I will do what I can to punish the men who used you.” She shook her head, pulling the nightclothes back off of the bed and changing out of her dress. She sat on the side of the bed, watching Millie sleep.“There will be no point. The only one you can do anything to would be Greyback, and I can guarantee that he would find a much worse way to retaliate against us. Just leave it where it lies. What’s done is done, can we just please move on?” She could see that he was angry at her words, but he decided to drop the matter. He sat down beside her, kissing her softly.“Let us get ready for bed, Mollywobbles.” He stood and made his way over to the bureau, pulling his long untouched nightclothes from it. He changed quietly, the only sound in the room their breathing and the sound of clothes hitting the floor. Once he was done he joined her in the bed, pulling the quilt over him. It felt strange, his body in the bed next to her. Over the last year she had become accustomed to sleeping alone, the only ones laying with her leaving after they had satisfied themselves or her children on nights they had a hard time falling asleep. He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close. A thought crossed her mind, and she turned her face to look him in the eyes.“What is Azkaban like?” She asked, wrapping her fingers around the arm draped over her body. He looked at Molly, raising an eyebrow.“And why do you ask?” She shifted so that she was facing him fully.“Well, if the Dark Lord were to fail.” She saw him getting ready to sit up and grasped his arm tighter. “If Potter won, and the Dark Lord fell, we would go to Azkaban, would we not? I have no doubts the Dark Lord will succeed; I just want to know what it is like.” He thought for a moment before sighing.“Awful. Thankfully the dementors are aligned with the Dark Lord. They did not touch us unless we were starving, but that was enough.” He swallowed thickly before carrying on. “They suck the happy memories right out of you. Leave you with only your darkest thoughts. I never want to go back there.” He did look thinner, sallow skinned with dark circles around his eyes, but not nearly as bad as those who had returned after many years there. “I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. It is an awful place; one I hope you never have to see. The room is made entirely of stone, it is far in the northern sea. You have a window, very small with no glass, that is open to the elements.” He shivered softly, his fingers digging into Molly’s side. “Please do not make me recount it, my dear.”“I am sorry, Walden. It was not my intent to hurt you in any way. Let us go to sleep now, in our warm bed, together.” He kissed her softly on the ear, snuggling into her side. Molly rolled so that her back was against him, pulling his arm tighter over her. He fell asleep quickly, rolling away from her as he repositioned himself. Molly lay there awhile, thoughts rolling through her mind endlessly. Deciding she was not going to sleep anytime soon; she left the room quietly shrugging a robe over her nightclothes. Her wand in her pocket she made her way to the front doors of the manor and sat on the steps outside, the warm summer breeze blowing through her hair. She sighed, leaning against the stone railing of the steps, and breathed in the sweet wind. It smelled like the flowers growing a short distance up the path, hedging the walkway. A thought occurred to her, and she sat bolt upright. She had seen others do this in the past, using their patronus to send a message before. She wouldn’t send one of course, as she had vowed to not to send one to Macnair, but this would not necessarily be a message. It would just be a reassurance, she hoped. Pulling her wand out she looked at it for a moment, hoping she was right.“Expecto Patronum.” A silver whisp emerged from her wand, quickly taking on the form of a large bear. It walked around in front of the steps for a moment, before turning to face her. “Go to Arthur. Let him see you, and once he does disappear.” The bear turned and bounded down the gravel pathway, fading into a streak of silver once more and fading. She didn’t know whether it would work or that Arthur would even understand, but it was the only thing she could do to let him know she was alive. She hadn’t cast a patronus around him since their final year at Hogwarts while preparing for their N.E.W.T. exams. But she and Arthur had practiced hard, learning to cast a corporeal patronus to send messages to one another across the school. She couldn’t recall how many times she had been told off by teachers for improper use of the spell, and while Arthur’s small corporeal patronus of a weasel hadn’t been too distracting, her large bear form had caused some problems when it would burst unexpectedly into classrooms. She smiled at the memory, shifting to lean against the cool stone once more. She watched the moon in its track across the sky, the horizon lightening as the sun made its appearance. Soft orange and pink streaked the sky, the indigo of night fading in the dawn of a new day. It seemed, to Molly, like a promise.

Molly lay on the bed with a tiny child cupped to her breast sleeping softly. It had been a long night, the labor had been more difficult than her last two, but now her child was here. Walden had named him, Alcott Morten after some family members along up his line. She was grateful he claimed her son, though he was not the father. He had been gentler with her since his return from Azkaban. He no longer threatened her, and their nights together were not painful anymore. His time away seemed to soften him and, Molly guessed, her continued and increased participation in both missions and their home life seemed to make things smoother. She ran her finger along her son’s arm softly, relishing in the feeling of newborn skin. His hair was a lighter color than hers, but red all the same. His eyes were dark blue, like Millie’s had been when she was born. He had her nose, but not her ears. His face was sharper than hers as well, seeming to favor whoever his father was’ strong jaw. He stretched in his sleep, cooing softly as he repositioned himself against her shoulder. The door opened and Narcissa entered, followed by Walter and Millie. Walter held his sister’s hand as she toddled in. Walter was now four, his speech had become much clearer, and he had taken on a teacher like role for Millie who was nearly two.“Would you two like to meet your brother?” Walter helped his sister to the bed, lifting her up onto it before crawling into position beside Molly. “His name is Al.” Walter repeated the name as he looked to his brother, attempting to help Millie say it as well. Her attempts were not as clear as Walter’s had been when she was born.“Walter, can you name your family?” Molly asked. The boy brightened, one of his favorite topics was learning about his family. He asked her exhaustively when he would meet them. One day, hopefully had always been her answer.“Yes, Mumma. There’s Daddy, Dadda, Mumma, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, me, Millie, and Al.”“Very good, Walter.” He returned his attention to his brother, who was now awake and looking towards his siblings.“How are you feeling, Molly?” Narcissa took her usual chair at the desk, watching the four of them on the bed.“Tired and hurting, but I doubt its life threatening.” Her tone was lighthearted as she passed Al over to his brother, watching as Millie began poking his arm. Walter, ever the protector and teacher, reprimanded her softly and showed her how to interact with him.“Have you heard anything about the children?” She asked, repositioning to a more comfortable position.“No. Potter and the Granger girl are still missing; your home has been searched many times but so far the belief is that Ron is home with Spattergroit. I do not think they will go near enough to him to verify. You are lucky you had a ghoul living in the attic.” Molly laughed.“I hope they are ok. It took a lot of willpower to close of my mind when I found out they had just disappeared, but Severus assured me that everything will be okay. I hope he is right… I have no doubt that he is with them, though. That boy is loyal beyond understanding.” She stoked Millie’s hair softly as she crawled over to sit on Molly’s lap and watch Walter rock Al gently to sleep. “What is going on with the Ministry?” She turned her focus back to Narcissa. In the last few months as her pregnancy had progressed she had spent much of her time at home, a command that had surprisingly come from Bellatrix. ‘Protecting the future blood.’ She had said.“They have begun persecuting muggleborns in higher numbers. Taking their wands, torturing them, killing them. Andromeda’s husband is on the run, they called him for interrogation last month and when they went to enforce him to attend he was gone. Andromeda’s safe, of course, due to her blood status, but she is marked as a traitor due to Ted and then Nymphadora’s participation in the Order. As well as her marriage to Remus Lupin.” Molly looked up to Narcissa.“Tonks married Lupin?” She hadn’t seen either of them since the battle at the Department of Mysteries.“Yes, secretly over the summer. She is pregnant as well, I believe. Staying with Andromeda as far as I am aware. The dementors have entirely left their station at Azkaban. They have descended on the nation, feeding off of muggles. Despair has followed them, England is terrified. I do not think this will persist much longer, though. He plans to make his final attack in May. Kill Potter and take power. Even now, hundreds are amassing in preparation. We have new recruits every day. Most are sent out as snatchers, to hunt down the muggleborns. Greyback has done his work, riling up the werewolves in favor of the Dark Lord. Macnair won the giants over years ago for him. This war is swiftly coming to an end, whichever way it goes. For my family’s sake, I hope he fails. Azkaban seems better than living under him. The last time was not nearly as awful as this, he terrifies both Lucius and me. And now, I have Draco to fear for. He is just a boy, and he has far too much to bear on his shoulders. He is safe at the school right now. As a branded Death Eater, he is well watched for. Amycus and Alecto are there, torturing the students. But Severus is watching over them as best he can.” Molly shook her head in disbelief.“It astounds me that they believe this will make the world better. Everyone fears the Dark Lord. He is a tyrant, not a leader. He will not stop with Britain. He will not be content.” Narcissa nodded her head sadly. Daily, there were people coming through the manor. Swearing their allegiance towards the Dark Lord or being tortured for information. Her own family was being watched; she knew that. But her vow with Macnair kept them protected, to a degree. Unless they were caught during a mission they could not be touched. It even bought a slight buffer for Ginny at school, that they could not touch her simply for her affiliation with the Order. A few seconds of silence hung in the air. Just as Narcissa opened her mouth to speak, the door burst open. Bellatrix stood there; her wand drawn.“We need to have a chat.” She was looking at Molly, her eyes deranged. Molly set Millie down beside her siblings, standing to face her.“May we do this in another room? As to not scare the children, if we may.” Bellatrix rolled her eyes and waved Molly out, having her march in front. They made their way to the drawing room, which was now empty, and had her stop.“This is about your participation, prior and upcoming. While you have come far, it is not far enough. You still have not cast a successful killing curse, only managing to knock the target unconscious. You will participate in the final battle. In May, we will attack Hogwarts. We will kill the Potter boy. And you will fight, killing any man, woman, or child who stands between us and victory. Am I understood?”“Yes, Bellatrix. I hear you loud and clear.” Bellatrix narrowed her eyes towards Molly, raising her wand.“Crucio.” Molly fell to the floor screaming. Bellatrix walked over to her as she writhed on the floor in agony. Cackling, she kneeled beside her and held Molly’s head in place with nails biting roughly into her cheek. Molly’s screams became hoarse as her throat became raw, Bellatrix watching her eyes rolling back. “You speak to me respectfully, do you understand?” Molly struggled to nod her head, nearly impossible between the pain and Bellatrix’s hold on her face. Satisfied, Bellatrix dropped Molly’s face and walked away, removing the curse as she made her way towards the door. “Lovely chat, thank you for talking with me!” She cackled, leaving Molly to gasp on the floor as the pain receded slowly. Shaking, she struggled to her feet and made her way to the door. She needed to return to her children. She stumbled up the hallway and to her room, holding her weight up against the wall as her legs trembled beneath her. She finally made it to the room and entered, nearly falling to the floor as she lost her grasp on the door. Narcissa rushed over to her, helping her back up.“Are you alight, Molly? You are pale.” She helped Molly to the bed and laid her down gently, pulling the covers over her. She went to the bureau and pulled a healing potion from it, guiding Molly into a sip.“You are nearly out. I will send an owl to Severus asking for more tonight. What did Bellatrix do to you? We could hear your screams in here.” Molly took another sip of the potion, feeling strength return to her limbs.“She told me I would participate in the final battle. She did not care for the tone I used when I responded and used the Cruciatus curse on me, said that I will answer her respectfully.” Narcissa pursed her lips, anger flaring in her eyes.“She goes too far. I knew she was wicked when we were children, but I never thought she would become who she is now… I wonder what we may have become, had things gone differently. The paths we may have walked.” She looked to the floor, her lips trembling as she puled herself together. “I am very sorry, Molly. For everything.” Molly shook her head.“What others choose to do is never on us. She made her choices, you have made yours, I have made mine. In the end, the consequences will fall to us for what we have done. But it is in the past, and all we can do is look to the future. No matter what we do, whether we are ready or not, tomorrow will come. So, we have to face each day as it does. But never blame yourself for anyone’s actions. They have been chosen. I had a choice, and though I regret the circumstances that led to them, I do not regret protecting my family. I will take my consequences with peace.” Narcissa shook her head softly.“I wish I could be as brave as you.” She stood, taking Al from Molly. “I will put him to sleep, you put them to bed, and we will go.” Molly helped Walter and Millie up.“Where will we go?” She asked.“Somewhere. To do something. You need a break from all of this for a little while, and so do I. A few moments to pretend life is normal.” Molly took the children to the room next door, dressing them for bed. Laying them into the tiny beds she sat and sang to them while their eyes fluttered into a quiet sleep. Leaving them there she returned to her room, changing into warmer clothes, and pocketing her wand. It was after dark so she doubted they would leave the manor, but the old halls were still chilly during the winter. She followed Narcissa up a few flights of stairs, ending up in the kitchens. House elves looked to see the two of them and bowed, offering them many things. Nia approached and pushed them to the side, bringing cups of tea to them.“Mistress Molly, how are you feeling?” Molly took a sip of the floral tea, relishing in the sweet flavor.“Much better, thank you Nia.” Nia bowed once more, leaving the two of them to talk. Narcissa sipped her tea slowly, swirling the steaming liquid in her cup.“Do you want to get some tea to go, and find somewhere to talk?” Molly nodded, aware of how many ears were in here that were not below spreading information to their masters.“Nia, can you bring a tea tray into the library for me, please?” Molly asked. Nia bowed lowly, rushing to pull the tray together for them. They left their empty cups on the table as they left, heading to the library. “In my time here, I have seen no one else enter. Not exactly the most educated lot.” Molly laughed, limping down the stairs. Narcissa chuckled softly, taking her hand to help her down the last few steps. When they entered the library it was empty, but a pot of steaming tea and two empty cups sat waiting on the table. Molly shut the door behind them, casting a silencing charm over the room.“I sent Severus an owl while you were putting the children to bed. You should have new healing potions tomorrow if he is not too busy.” Molly poured herself a cup of tea, contemplating.“Narcissa, what would you do if you could leave? No repercussions. No punishment. You and your family free, to do anything.” Narcissa poured herself a cup of tea.“Find a hobby I enjoy. I tire of this manor. I would live in a simpler home, just Lucius and me. I would encourage Draco to pursue his desires. Lucius to find a job he enjoys. Money is not a problem, we have enough to live comfortably the rest of our days. I just want to see them happy, content. After all of this, I just want a life where nothing hangs over us. Where our biggest concerns were a bad day at work, or a project that did not turn out the way I had planned.” She sighed, taking a sip of her tea. “What about you? If there were no consequences for your time here, what would you do?” Molly set her teacup on her knee, staring into the dark liquid.“I would want everything to go back to the way it was before. Were my biggest concern was preparing dinner or making sure my children hadn’t forgotten anything when leaving for school. The quiet nights where Arthur and I would sit together in the living room, each doing something different but spending the time together none the less and enjoying it. But I don’t think that is possible. After what I have done, they could never view me the same way again. Even if I were free, I would be a stranger to them. I hope that vision of another life works out for you, Narcissa. I truly do.” She shook the cup gently, watching the tea ripple to the edge of the cup.“I do not necessarily think so, Molly. If they are how you describe them to me, I do not think they would cast you aside as you believe. Your actions were done to protect them. Your being here was not by your choice. Your actions were not truly even a choice, as it was between that and death. Your actions protected them, no matter how awful. You gave your life for them, and I cannot see a truer expression of love.” Molly shook her head at Narcissa’s words.“No matter the intent behind them, the actions were unforgivable. They would not have killed me. I would have remained locked in Walden’s room bearing his children. But he would hurt them to ensure my compliance. I do not have a higher moral ground for what I did, nor a lower, in my eyes. Motivation does not counter the effect. Whether they understood my actions or not, it would be their choice to agree or disagree.” A knock at the door caught their attention, Molly removing the silencing charm.“You may enter.” At Narcissa’s words the door opened, revealing Snape. He shut the door behind him, taking a seat on the couch beside Molly’s chair.“You may want to put that silencing charm back up, Molly.” Molly placed the spell around the room once more, setting her wand on the table.“What are you doing here, Severus?” Narcissa asked, pouring him a cup of tea. He took the proffered cup, setting it on the arm of the couch beside him but not taking a sip.“Your letter concerned me. I brought some of the potions with me, I gave them to your elf to bring them to your room. I wanted to make sure Molly was alright.” Molly set her cup on the table, leaning into her chair.“I am fine, Severus. I delivered my son today, and Bellatrix used the Cruciatus curse on me for being disrespectful towards her. Why was there concern in that enough for you to come see me?” She asked.“I am concerned for your mental state more than anything. Several times now you have had that curse used on you, more than is safe or normal for even Auror’s. After what happened to Alice and Frank I… I fear for you, Molly. Even from that alone, but paired with the torture and trauma of a… Personal nature… I am concerned for you. You have shoved all of it aside and are ignoring it for the most part. You are in a mode of survival, and that is fine, but once this is over, if Potter is to succeed, you will be out of this permanent state of fight or flight and have to face what occurred to you. That is a much darker place than this is. You will have panic attacks, remembering events. Even though you are safe you will have moments you are terrified for your life. The muggles call it post traumatic stress disorder. I believe that your… visits… with Walden, and even the others, will affect you. It can cause a fear of intercourse, or an increased desire for it. Both are likely, a revolving door.” Molly lowered her head as she remembered the nights she had thrown herself into sex to repress everything else. Snape allowed her a moment to think before continuing.“You have bouts of depression now, but it will increase when you are away from here as you have time to truly process what happened. Trouble sleeping, concentrating. You may become overwhelmed with shame or grief of what you have done. Irritability or aggression. Self-destructive behavior is common. Fear will always be lurking in you, easily startling at simple things. Nightmares. Hopelessness. You will want to push everyone away. You will need them the most at those times. Your memory will be affected as well, you will be forgetful. I can see your fear that they will reject you. I think those fears are unfounded. Even if you feel you are far to stained for them to receive you, don’t distance yourself when they try to help.” Molly wiped a tear from the corner of her eye, holding her breath as she fought not to cry.“I thought muggles were useless, why are you badgering me with some hogwash thing they preach.” She said bitterly, nails of her hand digging into the denim of her jeans.“You cannot try to redirect me from what concerns you, Molly. Your defenses are not enough that I cannot read through you. Magic may be useful, but the muggles have done incredible work when it comes to understanding the human body. I have hope that one day the magical community may come to accept that and integrate their knowledge with magic. I think amazing things could be done to help us. I think of Alice, and how if they would look into the workings of the mind they might bring her to remember herself, and her son. I know you are upset, but you cannot lose hope and resign yourself to this life simply because you believe you deserve it. You deserve so much more. Just remember what I have said today, when you are home safely with your family at the Burrow.” He stood and left the room, his tea untouched. Narcissa placed her hand over Molly’s as she tried to repress her sobs, her other reaching to take the cup of now cold tea off her knee.“He is right, you know. Even though you are not ready to hear it, you do deserve far more than this.” She set the teacup onto the table taking her free hand and holding both of Molly’s as she cried.

Molly laid Al into his crib after his feeding, changing his nappy out for a clean one and pulling his clothes back on. She placed his blanket around him to block out the cool air in the room, humming softly as he cried. Her hand flashed to her stomach as nausea rolled upwards, catching in her throat. She hoped that she was wrong, that she was not pregnant again so soon after Al’s birth, but as she rushed to the toilet and threw up her lunch it seemed like she would have to get used to disappointment.“Shit.” She muttered, wiping her mouth, and standing up. She flushed it down and rinsed her mouth, looking up into the mirror as she dried her hands. She could barely recall herself before. The woman that stared back was thin, dark circles under her eyes as they distantly looked at her. The scar across her face had healed fairly well, her fingers tracing down her right cheek the raised skin across her lips and to her chin. Her eyes traced the one running down her arm, watching her reflection move as she appraised the scar. The hem of her dress showed off the last bit of the scar across her abdomen. She no longer sported the bruises that had once been common, however. Her eyes may be what startled her the most, though. They had always been warm, but now as she looked intently at them they were cold and empty. The brown was no longer inviting but devoid of life.Turning her head away from the mirror she made her way to the drawing room and down into the cellar. Over the last few months a few people had become permanent residents of the manor, if even unwillingly. Ollivander had been the most shocking to her, along with a Goblin named Griphook. But During Christmas break a sweet young girl had arrived, by the name of Luna Lovegood. She recognized her, of course, from the battle at the Department of Mysteries. She had spent a considerable amount of time with the girl, befriending her. She had been shockingly kind, considering the circumstances. As she entered the cellar with a plate of food she had grabbed along the way, voices whispering deep in the cellar ceased. Locking the door behind her, she ventured further into the cellar. Luna peeked her head around a pillar, her face lighting as she saw Molly.“Hello, Mrs. Weasley!” When Luna had discovered who Molly was she had made a point to call her by her old name. ‘Despite what you think, you are still her.’ She had told Luna a heavily edited version of how she had come here, and the girl had been very firm that Molly was not a bad person for the choices she had made. She approached her with a little skip, eyes drawn to the plate of food.“I brought you guys some food.” She offered weakly, handing the plate to the girl.“Oh, thank you Mrs. Weasley! Mr. Ollivander, Mr. Griphook, we have food.” She went beck into the darkened reaches of the cellar, sharing the food with the two others who were still hidden. A weak voice rang out.“Thank you very much, Mrs. Weasley.” She recognized Ollivander’s voice, and a muffled and short ‘Thanks’ from Griphook. Luna made her way back towards Molly, her plate much emptier than it had been before. They sat together on the floor, Molly casting a heating charm to try and warm the chilled stone. Luna finished her plate quickly, setting it onto her lap when she was done.“How are your children, Mrs. Weasley?” She asked, warm eyes fixing on Molly’s gaze.“They’re doing well. Al is getting bigger every day it seems, and Millie is running around constantly. I am thankful I have Walter to keep an eye on her, or I would have lost her a long time ago.” She chuckled, readjusting as her knee began to bother her.“Children are always a handful, but it seems to me, a gift as well. As I grow older it is always refreshing to see their innocence…” Molly looked away sadly. This child had been forced to grow up, mature far beyond her years as she sat locked away as a prisoner of war. Sentenced for her father’s stance, though one she held firmly on her own as well. “Are you alright Mrs. Weasley?” She asked, pulling Molly’s focus back to her.“Oh, yes. I am alright, Luna, I just… I am very sorry, for what you have gone through…” She trailed off, unsure if there was anything even to say to Luna. Luna shrugged slightly, smiling.“You didn’t take me off the train and lock me down here. No, Mrs. Weasley. You are trapped, the same as me, though your bars are not physical. The only difference is that you see yourself as a crook, and not the victim. You are not evil for protecting your family.” Her tone was airy, but her eyes reinforced her words. She set her hand atop Molly’s, squeezing gently. Her hands were like ice. Molly wrapped them in her own, trying to share any bit of warmth she could as they sat there. Noise from upstairs startled her as she rose to her feet. Footsteps approached and as they started down the stairs Luna pulled her towards the back of the cellar.“Hide back here, Mrs. Weasley!” She pulled her behind a pillar and into the shadows. The cell door opened and the sound of someone being shoved inside met their ears. The door clanged as it closed, the sound of it locking firmly in place ringing out. The next words shook Molly to her core, freezing the air in her lungs.“NO! LET US OUT, DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH HER!” Ron. It was Ron’s voice. She knew it was Ron’s voice, even though it had changed. It was deeper now, and it sounded panicked, but it was her Ron’s voice. She stepped back, hand clutching over her heart as tears sprang to her eyes. Luna looked to her, concern in her soft eyes.“Ron?” She asked, stepping out from behind the pillar. The sound of banging ceased.“Luna? What’re you doing here?” Harry. That was Harry’s voice. They had captured them.“They brought me here after Christmas. What are you guys doing here?”“Snatchers caught us. We apparated right into a group of them in the forest. We tried to mess Harry’s face up, but I don’t think it fooled them too much since ‘Mione and I were with him. Gave them false names, though, so hopefully it will take them some time to figure it out. Who else is back there?” She could hear Ron growing closer. She began to hyperventilate as his footsteps grew louder.“Mr. Ollivander and Griphook.” She was against the back wall now, nails digging into the skin of her neck as she tried to quiet her breathing. He rounded the side of the pillar and directly in her sight. His eyes fell on her, confused for a minute as he looked into her eyes. Then cold shock ran through them, before tears sprang to his eyes as well.“Mum?” His voice broke. Molly couldn’t stop her sobs as he stared at her in disbelief. “Mum, what are you doing here?” He ran to her, wrapping his arms around her tightly. Slowly she unfolded hers and wrapped them around him as well, trembling.“Ron?” She asked, her voice barely a whisper.“I thought you were gone… I thought you were dead.” He was sobbing as he held to her. Over just past his arm she could see Harry staring at her in disbelief as well, tears in the corners of his own eyes.“Hullo, Mrs. Weasley.” He offered weakly. A soft chuckle escaped Molly as she clutched Ron against her just a little tighter. She stroked his hair softly, having to reach as he now towered over her. She pressed her face into his chest and breathed deeply, her sobs turning into hiccoughs. He pushed her away a little, looking over her face.“What did they do to you, Mum?” He traced his eyes over her visible scars. As he followed the one down her arm his eyes flicked over to the other, his body stiffening as he saw the Dark Mark on her arm. He pushed her away roughly, eyes flashing as he looked her in the eyes.“You’re a Death Eater?” He asked incredulously. He stepped away from her, a mix of emotions running across his face as he tried to process. She struggled to even form her story, a lump in her throat impossible to swallow stopping her from talking entirely.“Ron, I-” He cut her off.“No! I don’t want to hear it! We thought you were dead! DAD THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD! Do you know how badly that affected him? He was just gone for months after! He never gave up on you, he is still searching, and you were here? A bloody Death Eater? It would have been better if you were dead!” He put more distance between them as Molly began sobbing once more. She tried to lean against the wall beside her as she fell to her knees.“Ron, please… Let me-”“No! There are no excuses!” He turned to leave her there but was cut off unexpectedly by Luna.“Ronald Weasley! You listen to what she has to say! I have had the fortune of getting to know her, and you will listen to what she has to say!” Ron stepped back from Luna, shocked that she had yelled at him.“Luna, she is a-” Luna raised her hand, silencing Ron.“Not freely. Not willingly. You listen to her, or so help me.” Her eyes flashed dangerously. Ron looked back to Molly who had kneeled over herself, weeping. He approached her slowly, settling to his own knees gently. He placed his hand hesitantly onto her back, rubbing softly.“I am sorry… Please. Tell me.” It was a whisper she could barely hear over her cries. She sucked in deeply, trying to control it enough to tell him. Once she had regained control over her breathing she fixed her eyes on the floor, unable to look at him.“They day they took me… Rodolphus nearly killed me… I woke up here a week later. Macnair had asked for me… He had proposed before I left school, so that the Macnair family would be tied to the Sacred Twenty-eight. I refused because of your father. That’s why my parents disowned me… He took me to force me into marriage and… Produce him heirs…” Ron’s hand drew back suddenly, and she could hear his gasp. She closed her eyes and dug her nails into her arms to anchor herself. “I didn’t do anything willingly. I fought. I argued. He let Rodolphus torture me if I got too far out of line… Until he offered me something I couldn’t refuse. Your safety… If I followed the commands given to me, they would not harm you for your allegiance Dumbledore. To Harry. We made an Unbreakable Vow. That I would never try to escape, and I would do as they ask, if you all were protected. He commanded me to take the mark. Just before the attack on the Quidditch World Cup. I…” She dissolved into tears once more, drawing blood with her nails. Ron’s hand pulled hers away softly as he pulled her against himself into another hug.“It’s okay, Mum… I am sorry… You said he took you to produce heirs… Have you?” Molly tensed in his arms.“Yes… I have three children here, and I am pregnant again.” She expected him to push her away, but he didn’t, just letting out a pained noise as he held her, his forehead resting against the crown of hers.“I will find a way to get you out of here. Everything will be okay.” She shook her head, attempting to pull away.“That isn’t it, Ron. I… I have hurt people… Everything they told me to do, I did…” His grip tightened a bit at the realization of what she was saying hit him.“Did you ever kill anyone?” He asked, his voice tight.“Not directly, no… But I know several, through my actions have died. The attack on London alone, I watched two muggles die as a result of the spells I cast.” She expected him to push her away, but he held her tighter against him, his head resting against hers.“I love you, Mum… I am sorry for what you’ve had to go through.” She pulled away from him.“How? How can you love me after what I have done? I attacked you guys, I have hurt and killed people!” Ron’s eyes narrowed.“What do you mean you have attacked us?” He asked.“I… I was at the graveyard when the Dark Lord returned. And the Department of Mysteries as well. I never cast a spell to hurt you, and I paid for that dearly, but I couldn’t bring myself to hurt you.” His eyes softened.“I love you because you were willing to give all of yourself to protect us. You did horrible things, yes, but with the deaths of yourself and your family hanging over your head. And from what you have told me you have done your best to minimize damage as much as you could. I cannot imagine the things they did to you, and you’ve still held strong. “You have done amazing, and I am honored to be your son… I have to do something to get you out of here.” She shook her head.“I can’t leave, Ron. Until either I or Walden are dead, I cannot leave. I vowed I wouldn’t.” He closed his eyes for a moment.“Damn… DAMN IT! No, I will find a way, I swear.” She cupped his cheek softly, resting her forehead against his.“No… No, Ron, this was more than enough. I never expected to see any of you again, so this in itself was a miracle. But after this, I don’t think there is hope. If Harry loses, I am stuck here the rest of my life. If he wins, Azkaban or death await me. Already I have been ordered to fight in the final battle. If I survive, I will be declared an enemy. But you, my sweet boy, will be a hero.” She wiped away a tear that trailed down his cheek. Harry made his way over and kneeled beside the two of them.“Mrs. Weasley, may I?” He offered his arms weakly. She pulled Harry into a tight hug, nearly crushing him.“I always saw you as one of my own, Harry… I am so sorry-” He cut her off.“Absolutely not. You do not apologize about this to me. It wasn’t your fault, and I will do everything in my power when this is over to protect you. The word of The Chosen One goes pretty far, you know.” It was a poor attempt at a joke, but it had Molly laughing anyway. She stroked his hair gently, looking his face over. The swelling was going down, and she took in the details of both their faces.“Often I find myself wondering... I think about all the times we would have had as a family in another life.” Her voice was quiet as she looked the both of them over trying to memorize their features. Above them the sounds of screaming erupted into the silence. Horror washed over Ron’s face as he jumped to his feet.“Hermione! HERMIONE! What are they doing to her?” Molly closed her eyes against the screams.“Interrogating her, most likely. They do this to everyone who comes through.” She placed her hands over her ears until the screaming stopped. Hands shaking, she cupped one of Harry’s and Ron’s in her own. The sound of footsteps reached their ears. Molly stood, looking to Ron.“I have to leave, Ron. If they see me down here I will be in trouble.” She cupped her hand against his cheek once more, pulling him into a hug. “I love you so much.” He pulled her tighter against him.“How are you going to get out? They’re coming down the stairs.”“Anti-disapparation jinx. Only those with the Dark Mark can apparate on the grounds. I’ll be okay, Ron.” She felt fire flash across her forearm. They had called the Dark Lord.“I promise, Mum. I won’t stop until you are home.” She pulled away and with a final glance towards Harry, Ron, and Luna, she disapparated out of the basement. She apparated to her room, limping back down the staircase and back towards the drawing room. As she approached, she could hear voices yelling.“HOW DARE YOU DISOBEY YOUR MASTERS! YOU COULD’VE KILLED ME!” Bellatrix’s scream could be heard through the manor as she approached the door to the drawing room. As she opened it, the strangest sight caught her eyes. A houself stood with Harry, Ron, and a girl she recognized from the Department of Mysteries. The chandelier which had hung from the ceiling lay shattered on the floor, Bellatrix a few feet on the other side of it looking furious.“Dobby never meant to kill. Only harm, or seriously maim.” Molly made her way over to Narcissa, who was holding onto Draco. Molly barely had time to process what was happening as Bellatrix pulled a knife out and threw it at the group as Dobby grabbed onto Harry’s hand and disapparated. The knife flew into the whirling ball of their disappearance, vanishing. Bellatrix screamed into the silence that remained. Molly grabbed a hold of Narcissa’s hand, pulling her out of the room. Draco trailed behind mutely, terror in his eyes. She brought them to her room, closing the door behind her. Draco stood where he stopped, staring into nothing.“Narcissa, what happened?” She sat Narcissa on the edge of the bed, pulling her chin forward so she looked Molly in the eyes. She seemed shell shocked as she tried to focus on Molly’s gaze.“Bella, she… She tortured that poor muggle born. Demanding where they had found the sword of Gryffindor. She… I have never seen Bella that deranged. It terrified me.” Her gaze finally focused on Molly’s. “The Dark Lord is going to be angry. Harry Potter escaped, and we weren’t able to stop him. He is going to be furious.” She was shaking now. Molly turned her gaze to Draco who still hadn’t come to himself just yet.“Draco, come sit down.” She guided him to the chair by the desk, helping him to sit on it. He looked to her numbly, something she had never seen before entering his gaze.“I am so sorry, Mrs. Weasley. For everything that they’ve done to you. I am sorry for mocking you when I was younger.” Remorse. That was the look in his eyes. She shook her head softly, stroking the side of his head.“Already forgotten.” She whispered. She sat with them awhile as they waited for the fury of the Dark Lord to befall them and all she could think about was the blessing it had been that the kids had been here and were long gone now. Selfish as it may be, she was happy she had gotten to see them one last time.

Molly stood on a hill high above Hogwarts castle. She watched as the Dark Lord destroyed the blanket of protection that laid over the school, ripping apart at the force of his spell. He seemed to stumble back, Bellatrix running to his side to help him. He pushed her aside roughly, looking back at his handywork as the protection spells failed. He turned to them, a wide grin spreading across his face.“It is time, my friends. Enter the castle and aim to kill. Go.” Placing her mask over her face she limped down the hill and towards the fight. Far in front of her she could hear the sound of battle as the first wave of Death Eaters descended upon the castle. She followed Narcissa and Macnair, who had slowed their pace some to accommodate her. As they crossed the stone bridge and into the courtyard they pulled their wands, jumping into the fight. She followed them inside as they cut through the wave of people, seeking more important targets within the school. Children were not their priority; the snatchers could handle them. Their mission lay with the Order members. Molly cut her way through battling pairs with blasting spells, sending them tumbling out of her way as she made her way up the stairs. On the third floor they stopped, finally reaching the Order members they sought. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Bill. Her heart nearly stopped seeing her son, his face now bore long scars, claw marks, across it. Macnair turned to her, laughing.“Here is your chance, Molly. Take him out.” Kingsley and Bill turned to fight them, wands raised and faces set. Bill shot a spell towards her she barely had the thought to defend, stumbling back. “Kill him!” Macnair yelled, pushing her forward. Narcissa’s cry startled her, her actions stalling the two men in front of them.“Avada Kedavra!” Molly turned to watch Bill and Kingsley, expecting one of them to fall. Behind her, she heard the sound of a body hitting the floor. She turned around to see Macnair laying across the rubble. She leaned down to pull his mask off of his face to see his eyes open and unfocused. Dead. She turned to Narcissa, who had pulled her mask off as well. “There. You are freed of your Unbreakable Vow, Molly. From here out, your choices are your own.” Bill’s eyes flashed between them, his hand reaching out to stall Kingsley as he raised his wand to attack them.“Wait a moment.” Molly looked back to Bill, her heart pounding. She reached behind herself, unfastening the mask’s strap, and letting it slide from her face. It fell to the ground, clanging as it made contact with the debris. Her eyes locked on Bill’s, tears building in the corner. Bill’s face slackened as he took her in, wand dropping to his side. Kingsley’s expression was shock as he raised his wand once more.“What are you doing?” He demanded, moving towards her slowly.“I was taken six years ago. I made an Unbreakable Vow to protect my family, and the consequence was that I became a Death Eater.” Her voice was flat, eyes still on Bill. He was struggling to choose an emotion, a storm of them brewing across his features.“I killed Macnair to free her. Take her. Protect her. She needs your help. Molly, I am going to find my own family and get out of here.” Narcissa turned and left, leaving her with the two men. Molly shrugged off her black robes, lighting them on fire. She flinched as she felt someone approach her, waiting for them to cast a spell and incapacitate her. Instead, Bill’s arms wrapped around her tightly.“Are you okay?” He asked, cupping her cheek softly. She couldn’t look him in the eyes, so she focused instead on his lips as she answered.“No, Bill. I am not.” He nodded softly, taking her hand in his.“Stay with us, we will see if we can protect you. Keep you safe from the others, with that mark on your arm.” He turned and pulled her along behind him as they made their way through the castle. Molly readjusted her grip on her wand, readying herself as they entered into a hallway filled with flying spells. They pushed their way through, Kingsley stopping to duel with Dolohov as Bill got caught by Mulciber. Molly covered his back, firing at any Death Eaters who tried to hit him from behind. He pushed his way past Mulciber who now lay unconscious on the floor. She followed him down a staircase and back to the second floor, caught by another wave of snatchers. She was separated from him and pushed further up the hall dueling one she had never seen before.“Ascendio!” The snatcher was tossed high into the air before she sent him hurtling back into the ground. He remained there unmoving as she turned to face her next opponent. A familiar frame met her eyes and her breathing stopped. As Arthur finished his fight with a snatcher he turned around, eyes scanning those around him for another fight. They swept right over her before stalling, his entire body seeming to crumble as he turned back to face her.“Molly?” His voice broke and he took a step forward. Molly reached her hand out to him, realizing too late what her mistake was. His eyes fell to the Dark Mark on her arm, hardening in disbelief.“A Death Eater? A Death Eater?” He stepped away from her, raising his wand.“No, Arthur. Please just let me-”“No. You chose your side. Now raise your wand and fight me.” She didn’t move, prompting him to take a step forward.“Flipendo!” She barely deflected the spell, begging him to stop. Tears formed in his eyes as he cast it again, nearly yelling this time.“FLIPENDO!” She didn’t block this one in time, the spell knocking her back several feet and to her knees. She looked up at him as he approached, refusing to raise her wand in defense.“I am sorry, Arthur… I’m sorry! I love you so much.” She sobbed, lowering her head.“You don’t get to do that. Not to me.” He bit the words out, a tear slipping down his cheek as he prepared to fire another spell.“DAD, NO!” A spell flew over her head, knocking Arthur off of his feet. A pair of hands wrapped around her arms, helping her to stand. Bill wrapped her gently in his embrace, the sound of battle absent. As she looked around the floor was filled with snatchers who had lost, Bill and her the only two standing in the hall. Arthur pulled himself to his feet, his face dark red.“What the bloody hell do you think you are doing, William? She is a marked Death Eater. She is our enemy.” His voice caught in his throat as he said this, but he swallowed it away and raised his wand to attack Molly once more. Bill pushed her behind him, standing between her and Arthur.“If you try to hurt her again, you have to go through me. You have to hurt me first. Or you can listen, and we can have Mum back again.” Arthur hesitated, his wand dipping slightly.“Listen to what? I grieved for you, Molly. And you were there, serving You-Know-Who. How can you explain that away?” He raised his wand once more. “Explain it, then!” He yelled. A sob caught in her chest as she stepped out from behind Bill, tossing her wand onto the floor.“Walden took me. He and some others attacked me. He forced me to marry him, Arthur. I made an Unbreakable Vow to obey him in order to protect the family. That they could not hurt them for their allegiance to Dumbledore. It was the only thing I could do. But I swore not to leave. That I would stay. And I would do it a thousand more times, sell myself away like that, if it meant you were safe.” She stopped as her voice broke. Arthur had lowered his wand, his eyes following her sadly. “I did as they commanded me. Every order I followed. Even to take the Dark Mark… I am sorry, Arthur. If it makes you feel better to hurt me, do. Or to leave me here and forget about me, do.” His hand fell limply to his side.“If you made an Unbreakable Vow, why now. What changed.”“Narcissa killed him when we ran into Bill. He ordered me to kill him. She made it so that I did not have to follow through with it, and that I was free to leave. I am sorry, Arthur…” She lowered her head as she began to cry, her hand covering her face. She felt familiar hands that she had nearly forgotten wrap around her softly. She looked up to see Arthur as he barreled into her, pulling her into a bone crushing hug.“I thought I’d lost you.” He gasped, burying his face into her hair. With trembling hands, she wrapped her arms around him, her stomach dropping.“Please tell me this is real. Please. Tell me I won’t wake up and you will be gone.” He pulled away from her neck and pressed his lips against her forehead softly.“This is real, and Molly, I am never ever letting go of you again.” He whispered, squeezing her into another hug. “I am sorry. Please… Forgive me.” She pulled away from him softly.“I should be asking you to forgive me.” She said, refusing to let go of his arms as they held whatever bit of each other they could. He shook his head softly.“You never apologize to me, you hear? You did what you could with what you were given. And I can never fault you for that.” Their moment was broken as Bill made his way towards them.“Hey, there are more coming. You better get ready.” He handed Molly’s wand to her, hugging her tightly before letting her go.“Keep her safe, yeah?” He said to his father. Arthur nodded grimly, lacing his fingers with hers tightly.“I am never letting go of her.” Bill nodded with a sad smile.“Love you, Mum.” With a final wave he left them there as the sound of approaching footsteps met their ears. Just as another group of Snatchers entered the end f the hallway. Molly and Arthur raised their wands, back-to-back they stood their ground, the fingers of their left hands tightly entwined. Another walked into the hallway, Molly stumbling back a bit into Arthur. Arthur turned to see who had caused Molly to react as such, eyes falling on Greyback as he stalked around the Snatchers with a low growl.“Trying to escape, Molly? I wonder how the Dark Lord will punish your children for this.” Anger burned through Molly as she drew her wand, casting the Cruciatus curse on Greyback. He fell to the ground howling, the Snatchers assembled around them readying to attack. A horrific feeling overcame them, and Molly could hear the Dark Lord as if he were speaking directly into her mind.“You have fought valiantly. Bravery which I have not seen in many years. I command my forces to retreat. I speak to you, Harry Potter. You have allowed others to die for you. Meet me in the Forbidden Forest within the hour, or I will order them to kill every man, woman, and child who stands between me and you. The rest of you, collect your dead and dispose of them with honor.” The voice faded, leaving her head spinning. The Snatchers lowered their wands and left them there. Greyback pulled himself up off of the floor roughly, biting an insult out towards Molly.“When you return to the manor I promise you will pay for your actions. You thought the last round was bad, just wait to see how many steps forward at one time to hurt you.” Molly balked, backing herself against Arthur. He pulled her behind him gently, placing himself before Greyback. A twisted smile lit the corners of his mouth as he leaned forward to whisper in Arthur’s ear.“Yeah, you just protect that filthy bitch. You have no idea what she is capable of. Watch your back, blood traitor.” He turned and stalked down the hallway, leaving them alone. They made their way down to the Great Hall, helping where they could to bring fallen students and Order members to be laid in the Great Hall one last time. Finding it difficult to breath, Molly leaned back against the wall and settling a hand over her stomach as nausea overcame her. Arthur helped to reposition Lupin and Tonks, settling them so that they were hand in hand. He noticed that molly was no longer right behind him and turned, panic filling him as he looked around the room. He caught sight of her hunched against the wall, hand on her stomach. Something struck him like a blow. Her stomach was distended slightly, and he remembered that stance from years ago. She would always be in the bathroom in the early mornings of her pregnancy like this, fighting the urge to be sick. He made his way over to her, wrapping his arms gently around her waist end encircling her stomach with his hands. She jumped at the feeling of someone behind her but settled at the familiar feeling of his hands.“You didn’t tell me you were pregnant.” It wasn’t accusatory, instead a simple statement tinged with sadness. She turned to face Arthur, wiping a tear away from her face.“I promise you I fought. The Unbreakable Vow came later and had nothing to do with that. The very first night I woke up there he… He forced me. I tried to fight, Arthur, I swear, but he had taken my wand away from me. I tried.” He hushed her softly, pulling her into his embrace.“I am not going to blame you for anything that happened, Molly. I already told you, you don’t need to apologize to me. We have you back, this is almost over. In the morning, it will all be over.” She shook her head, pulling away.“And if he wins? I will be killed. If he loses, I am a branded Death Eater. I will be punished either way for my actions.” Her voice rose some as her breathing became heavier. “Arthur, you have to do something for me. Please!”“What, Molly. What’s wrong?” Whatever he had expected, it was not her next words.“My children. Whatever happens, please save them. They are at Malfoy Manor, there’s three of them. Please, don’t make them suffer for my actions, or Walden’s. Please.” She was crying again, and Arthur simply pulled her into his chest, letting her cry it out.“Of course, Mollywobbles.” She tensed slightly but relaxed as his hand traced invisible patterns lazily across her shoulder.“What is this collar on your neck?” He asked, fingering the leather strap. Her hand flashed to it, surprised.“Honestly, I had forgotten it was even there. He placed it on me as a mark of his ownership. I wasn’t allowed to take it off.” Shaking her head softly she let him break the lock, tossing the leather collar far into the rubble beside them.“Thank you.” She leaned against his chest, listening to his breathing. Their attention was caught by what sounded to be Percy crying loudly.“I tried! I tried to save him, but it was too late! Rookwood caught us right after an explosion and he killed him!” Molly pulled herself upright and stood, Arthur helping her to balance at the sudden change of position. Percy and Bill were carrying someone between them, settling him into an empty space between two fallen students. As Molly’s eyes fell onto the face of the dead they had brought back a scream escaped her, a heavy weight pushing her down to her knees. Arthur kneeled beside her, pressing her face tightly into his neck. Unable to look at the body of Fred himself he focused on comforting her as much as he was able to. At her scream many of the surrounding survivors looked to see the pair there but averted their eyes at the scene. The only ones that remained were the eyes of her children. Bill simply sat beside Fred, grasping his hand tightly. Percy and George stared at the wailing frame of their mother, disbelief in their eyes. Bill called their attention to him quietly, hoping not to bother his parent’s grief.“I found her a couple of hours ago, during a fight with Macnair. She had been taken by the Death Eaters, far as I know, and made an Unbreakable Vow. Her obedience for our protection. Narcissa killed Macnair and set her free. Dad looked ready to kill her when he saw her. Just be careful with her, you know? She has been through so much, and I don’t think we know even a small portion of it. No telling what they did to her.” Percy looked back to his mother, wiping away tear that fell. He made his way over to them, hugging onto his mother gently. She wrapped an arm around him, pulling him tightly in. George simply lay over his brother, hugging the lifeless form of his twin. Percy pulled away as the sound of others entering the Great Hall met their ears. Ginny stopped dead in her tracks at the sight of her mother, looking between her and the twins. She made her way over to her mother, holding her at arms distance and taking in her appearance. She noticed the Dark Mark but pushed past it as she pulled her mother into a bone crushing hug. No words were needed as Molly reconnected with her children. Shakily she crawled her way over to Fred’s body, pulling George into a soft hug. He wept against her shoulder loudly, nails digging into the fabric of her dress. With her free hand she grasped Fred’s cold fingers, running hers up and down his gently. George released her so that she could focus on saying goodbye to Fred. She divided her focus between them, stroking Fred’s fingers with one hand while the other she carded through George’s hair softly. He was missing an ear, which struck an odd chord with Molly, but this was not the time to ask him questions about it.Beside her, Ron dropped to the floor and wept over his brother. Molly looked up to see the girl with bushy hair, Hermione, cover her face with her hands and Harry turn to leave the room. She continued to comfort her children the best she could as she sat there, the sound of others speaking falling into a low hum that filled the room. She didn’t know how long she sat there before horrific cramps in her legs forced her to stand. Arthur pulled her towards himself, placing a light sweater over her. The sleeves fell to her wrists, and she understood the purpose of the jacket was not to keep her warm but to hide her Dark Mark. She squeezed his hand softly. Hermione made her way over towards them, leaning against the wall as she looked them over.“You must be Mrs. Weasley?” She asked, extending her hand. Molly took It and they shook gently. “Ron told us about you all the time. I wish I had the opportunity to meet you before… Well…” Molly shook her head softly.“I remember his letters from his first year. Always, thrown somewhere in, was a little passage about this ‘insufferable little know-it-all’ and then, suddenly, you were his best friend. He couldn’t go without describing how smart you were, or pretty. I had been excited to meet you too, Hermione. But it was not meant to be. Not the way we expected… It is, however, lovely to meet you now.” They smiled to each other as light filtered into the shattered windows of the Great Hall. The young man she had seen at the Department of Mysteries entered the room, panicked.“They’re crossing the bridge! All of them!” They filtered out of the Great Hall and into the courtyard, watching the approach of the Death Eaters, her eyes landing on Narcissa. The woman was terrified, standing erect beside Lucius. Draco was nowhere to be seen. Molly pushed herself as tightly against Arthur as she could, trying to hide behind him.“Harry Potter, is dead!” A horrified silence swept over them. To their left she could hear Professor McGonagall scream, panic erupting all over those assembled in the courtyard. He hushed them, speaking once more. “To any of you who wish to join me, the offer is open. Draco, come.” Behind her movement stirred. Draco stepped out of the line and made his way across the courtyard. The Dark Lord stopped him on his way over, hugging him. “Molly, are you going to come as well?” He asked. She could feel all eyes on her as Arthur gripped her hand tightly. “Remember those children of yours, snuggled all safely back at the manor. It would be a shame if they burned to death in their beds.” Molly froze. She turned to face Arthur.“I’m sorry.” She kissed him softly against his lips, pulling away from him. She started to make her way across the courtyard and to their ranks, slipping the cardigan off and revealing her Dark Mark. Bellatrix gave her a cold look, moving so that she could take a place beside her. One final person moved forward, surprising all of them.“And what is your name?” The Dark Lord asked, laughing,.“Neville Longbottom.” He replied, shuffling forward on an obviously broken ankle.“Well, I am sure we could find somewhere for you-”“I’d like to say something.” The Dark Lord took a step back, waving for him to speak.“So what if Harry’s gone?”“Stand down, Neville.” An Irish kid spoke, shaking his head.“No. People die every day. But we still have what he fought for. That’s not gone. So what if he is. His heart still beats for us!” With his final words he dropped what appeared to be a dingy leather bag, pulling a gleaming silver sword from within. It was marvelous, jewel encrusted and glittering in the dawn. To her left she could see Hagrid drop Harry, stepping backwards as Harry jumped to his feet. The Dark Lord yelled, backing away from Neville wildly. In the confusion Molly ran across the courtyard, in her peripherals she could see the Malfoy family doing the same and losing themselves into the crowd of people. A pair of strong arms caught her, pulling her into Bill’s chest tightly.“I’ve got you, Mum. It’s okay.” Behind them she could hear the sound of the battle resuming loudly. They made their way into the school, awaiting the arrival of the remaining Dark forces. Bill pushed her into the Great Hall, covering her back as she looked for cover. Snatchers broke through the lines and flooded the Hall, Death Eaters breaking through right behind them. Battle erupted all around them. Molly found herself facing a set of Snatchers, as well as Greyback. She grit her teeth hard enough she could feel her jaw pop, pulling her wand out and readying herself to fight. Before they could even raise their wands in defense, Molly hissed her spell.“Sectumsempra.” The two Snatchers fell to the ground screaming as gashed welled blood across their stomachs, entrails sliding out onto the floor. Greyback caught a bad gash across his arm but was able to cast a shield charm before any other damage occurred. He grinned wolfishly to her, lowering his wand.“C’mon honey. Remember all the good times we had. We can go spend some more quality time together if you want to.” Just as he raised his eyebrow to insinuate his meaning, Molly cast another spell at him.“Orbis!” Screaming, Greyback was pulled into the ground beneath him, the stone melting like liquid and returning into its solid form as he sank beneath the floor. A hand grasped her shoulder lightly and she turned, ready to fight, but dropped her wand when she was Arthur. He pulled her into a hug.“I heard what he said… Did he ever?” He trailed off, unable to form a question with the words in his mind.“Yes. When Walden went to Azkaban for that year, several of them took advantage of the vow. I had been ordered to take directions from any Marked member, her never gave me an out with that. Several of them… enjoyed that loophole.” She looked away from him, her attention caught by a fight happening behind Arthur. Ginny was battling Bellatrix. Bellatrix cast a killing curse towards Ginny, who barely managed to block the spell. Molly pushed herself forward, pulling Ginny out of the way and raising her wand.“Not my daughter, you bitch.” Bellatrix cackled, lowering her wand.“Oh, itty bitty baby can handle it. I already know your limits, and as fun as listening to you scream for hours was, I want to know her limits. Oh, how deliciously close I came to breaking your mind. Let’s see how long until I can break your body! Molly cast her spell as Bellatrix rambled on, surprising the other woman. Her eyes blazed as she returned a spell, nearly hitting Molly. Wordlessly they fought, sending flares of light after each other and hoping to gain any higher ground. Finally, Bellatrix missed as Molly cast her spell, hitting her directly over her heart. She watched in horror, and a little grim satisfaction, as Bellatrix fell to the floor, dead. Exhausted, Molly stumbled a bit and was caught by Ginny who helped her to sit against the piece of bench thrown up against the wall. Around them, the battle continued raging. In the center of the room, Harry fought the Dark Lord. Arthur found them and took Ginny’s place beside her, wrapping an arm around her protectively. They watched as Harry cast a final spell, countering the Dark Lord’s killing curse, and rebound the curse onto its castor. To their shock the Dark Lord fell, unmoving, onto the cold stone floor.Silence flooded the room as every fight stopped. Death Eaters and Snatchers fled the room, escaping across the stone bridge and into the woods across the clearing. Molly relaxed, leaning into Arthur’s shoulder as she tried to process what had occurred these last few days. Free. She was free. She would have to return to Malfoy Manor soon and collect her children, as well as Nia. But that could wait until tomorrow. She knew they were safe as long as Nia had them. She had told her whatever happens, when people began to arrive back at the manor, to hide the children and wait for her. She had nodded grimly, swearing to protect them with her life. Harry came over to them after a while, asking of he could sit beside her. She nodded, scooting over some so that there was more room on the bench.“I promise you; we will do everything we can to make sure you are safe. From retaliation for your affiliation with the Death Eaters, for you leaving them, for your time imprisoned. I will make sure they don’t come after you.” Molly placed her hand on Harry’s gently.“Narcissa, too. And Draco. They only did what they had to out of fear for their family. Lucius joined willingly, but they did not. She protected me all these years and taught me how to defend myself without breaking commands.” He nodded grimly.“I’ll do what I can, Mrs. Weasley.” She thanked him as he left, leaning into Arthur’s warm embrace. He nestled his head atop hers, kissing the crown of her head.“It’s over, Mollywobbles. We are done.” She sighed, thinking about Snape’s words to her the last time he had seen her. You are in a mode of survival, and that is fine, but once this is over you will be out of this permanent state of fight or flight and have to face what occurred to you. That is a much darker place than this is. You will have panic attacks, remembering events. Even though you are safe you will have moments you are terrified for your life. She closed her eyes and pushed her face into his shoulder in attempt to block everything out.“Is it?” She asked, too low for him to hear but endlessly it was bouncing around in her mind. Something else is coming. She tried to push the unease away and just relish in this moment of peace, but far too much had happened. The toll of the war had been high, and she doubted she was through with paying her fine.

Molly sat on the couch watching as Arthur played with her children. No, their children. He had taken to them immediately, melting entirely into tears when Walter has hugged him excitedly, shouting ‘Dadda!’ when they had arrived to collect them from the manor. Nia had done as she asked, keeping them safe until her return. Even she had acclimated well to the new home, taking to cleaning the Burrow thoroughly upon her arrival, to make sure it was ‘presentable’ for the children. Millie had been slightly more cautious around him but warmed quickly as Arthur played with Walter. He sat up from his position, hand sliding to his lower back as he groaned.“Molly, seriously, we are much too old for children this young.” He chuckled, pulling himself to his feet. Al sat on the floor beside Molly’s feet, babbling away as he played with a wooden horse Ginny had given him. Arthur took a seat next to Molly, entangling his fingers with hers and pulling her to lean against his side. His hand settled across her stomach, softly rubbing across the swell. She sighed and closed her eyes, wanting to remember this moment forever. Arthur stiffened a bit, pulling away to look at Molly.“Honey, did you send your patronus to me?” He asked. She opened her eyes and sat up, leaning so that she faced him as well.“Yes. I couldn’t sleep one night, so I went to sit on the stairs outside the manor. Walden had forbidden me from sending messages, but I kind’ve wriggled around on that because my intent was not to give information or ask for help. Moreso, it was just the intent to reassure you that I was alive. I didn’t think it worked; we had never tried over such long distances.” His grip on her hand tightened some.“I saw it. I couldn’t sleep that night either. These last few years have been difficult… Most nights I spent tossing, nightmares of what may have happened to you kept me awake. With the war heightening, I just couldn’t sleep anymore. I was in the kitchen, and I saw it. Through the window above the sink. It padded through the yard and stopped, looking directly through the window and to me. I rushed to get out the door, hoping it was real and not just my grief, that maybe you had sent a message. But as I opened the door it faded into an incorporeal form and dissipated with the wind. I don’t know how long I sat there in the yard crying. Bill found me there as the sun rose and took me inside. I convinced myself it was just a dream.” Molly reached her free hand up to wipe the tear from his cheek as he leaned against her.“I am so sorry, Arthur. For everything. Sometimes I think maybe things would have been better if Rodolphus had killed me that day, or if I had continued to fight Walden… But I cannot say I would have made a different decision. I would join them again every time if it meant my actions kept my family safe.” A thought occurred to Arthur, his other hand grasping hers so that both were held in his.“That day at the ministry when Walden stopped me in the elevator… With his wife.” His hands slackened around hers.“That was me.” She swallowed thickly, trying to remove the lump that had caught in her throat. “We had made the Unbreakable Vow that day, and he wanted to test me. To make sure I would obey… I wanted… I wanted so badly for you to realize, but I refused to put you in danger by angering him.” Her voice broke as she dissolved into tears, trying to pull away from Arthur. He pulled her close and tried to comfort her but she fought him, trying to pull away. “Please, just let me go… Please!” It wasn’t Arthur in front of her anymore. All she could see was Macnair. She fought Arthur, trying to pull away.“Molly, it’s okay!  I promise, I am not angry with you.” She fought harder, her breaths becoming shallow as she tried to focus herself on reality, here with Arthur. But the shadow of Macnair hung darkly over her, and he always would. She pulled her hands away from Arthur as she fought to breath, running up the stairs. She slammed the bedroom door behind her and fell against the wall, sliding down to the floor. She could hear footsteps following her and reached into her pocket for her wand to defend herself, only to realize she had left it on the table downstairs. Her mind drew her back to the last time she had been chased through her home without it. As the door opened she threw her hands up in a feeble defense, screaming.Arthur stumbled to the floor as he opened the door, the sight of his wife terrified and trying to defend herself breaking him. But as she screamed it felt as if a force ran into him. He could feel her in his mind. Her memories tumbled by; snippets of the horrors she had faced presenting themselves to Arthur. He gripped the frame of the door as he relived her time in captivity. Her first night with Macnair as she begged Arthur to save her. Torturing the child, with the knowledge that her children were nearby and would suffer her inability to comply. The child falling lifeless to the ground. Her standing face to face with Arthur as she held numbly onto Macnair’s hand. Her screams as Rodolphus tortured her, and the shameful thing he made her do. He was sobbing now, as the memories continued. Her nights with Macnair, her shame at finding pleasure in them. The memory of the Cruciatus curse used on her again and again until she thought that surely she would finally die. The terror of facing You-Know-Who and taking the Dark Mark. The resilience he saw in her as she stood tall to protect her family. And suddenly, he saw himself. Coming to her one night, drawing her from sleep. Arthur? What are you doing here? Silence meeting her as he forced her down and raped her. He felt a deepening pit in his stomach as she begged him to stop. No, my child is crying. Please let me get her! Her acceptance as he pleasured himself. You were supposed to save me. His heart shattered at those words as he placed his hands around his head, screaming. You aren’t Arthur, are you. Macnair’s cold response. He is dead. We are free to enjoy each other now, Mollywobbles. Arthur sobbed, leaning forward so that his face nearly touched the ground.He saw the Department of Mysteries, the fight that took place. Her best attempts to minimize her damage and protect the children. Her punishment afterwards, and her visits from Death Eaters after Macnair’s imprisonment. The sounds of her screams as Greyback hurt her. His nails dug into the carpet beneath him as he struggled to breath. The attack on London as cruelly she participated, knowing her actions would result in countless deaths. Her visit with Ron, and the brief warmth that hope brought her. Her numbness as she prepared for the Battle of Hogwarts, knowing what the possible outcomes would be. Then came relief, as Bill enveloped her in his arms and protected her. The terror as he stood before her, ready to attack as she laid herself before him, accepting whatever outcome came for her. As suddenly as it swept over him it was gone, and he was aware of other people in the room. Percy was shaking his shoulders, trying to get his attention. Ginny stood beside Molly, softly whispering to her as she struggled to focus on her words.“Dad? Are you okay?” Percy sounded terrified as he helped Arthur to sit up. His hands were trembling as he grasped on to Percy, unable to see much detail through his tears.“Is she okay?” He asked, attempting to push past Percy. He held tight, giving Arthur a moment to regain control over his breathing and wipe his eyes. He pulled his glasses up off of the floor, sliding them back over his face. Clarity came over the room and Percy let go of him, allowing Arthur to crawl towards Molly. She looked up from between Ginny’s arms, shame flooding her eyes as she met Arthur’s gaze.“I’m sorry! I’m s-sorry!” She gasped, looking away from him. He reached to her gently, Ginny releasing her hold on her and letting her father take over. He laid her against his chest and cried with her, rubbing soothing circles into her shoulder as she sobbed.“Shh, Molly. It’s okay… I am not mad at you. I could never be angry at you for that…” They sat their awhile, Percy and Ginny leaving them so that they could recover from what just occurred. He watched the sun shift across the room as they calmed, the light finally settling onto a picture of them from Christmas many years ago. Some time after Molly stopped crying and silence had filled the room, he spoke.“I just have one question. What the hell was that? How was I able to see what you were remembering?” He asked. She tensed in his arms a bit before relaxing.“Narcissa taught me occlumency, to protect myself from the others. The Dark Lord could use legilimency, as well as a few other Death Eaters. She knew I wasn’t wholly devoted to him, neither was she. So, she taught me to use it and shield my mind from them, only allowing them what I chose for them to see. She taught me legilimency as well, delving into the minds of others. To seek information or to share your own. I am so sorry, Arthur. I never meant to show you that.” He repositioned them into a more comfortable spot.“Did you ever plan on telling me all of that?” He asked, eyes watering as he recalled her memory of ‘him’ raping her.“No. Not all of it. And the things I did need to share, I don’t know if I would have entirely shared the details. It wasn’t something I felt you should have to bear.” His hand cradled her swollen stomach as he thought.“I am glad, then, that this occurred. No matter how awful it was, Molly, I promised when I married you that no matter what came our way, we would face it together. I am sorry you had to go through so much alone, but you aren’t anymore. As long as I am breathing, we will face this together.” He helped her to her feet, tossing the blankets to the end of the bed. He laid down on the mattress, inviting her to lay beside him. He pulled the blankets up over them and waited for her to get comfortable. Once she was settled her curled up behind her, hand still over her middle protectively as they drifted to sleep. Molly fell quickly into a deep sleep, but Arthur slept fitfully, waking every so often as she moved. As the light began to fade outside she finally woke, shifting to face him.“Is it possible?” He narrowed his eyes in confusion, shifting on his shoulder.“Is what possible?” He asked.“To go back to normal. To be what we once were.” He wrapped his arm around her gently, bringing her closer to him.“I don’t think there is a need to go back. Despite what you think, I don’t think you have changed all that much. You are still Molly, a fiercely devoted mother who would do whatever she had to, to save her family. All there is to do is pick up where we left off. Sure, things will be hard. But in the end, you will always be my Mollywobbles. A mark on your arm doesn’t make you evil. Nor does the lack of one make someone good. There is so much more to it than that.” She looked into his eyes deeply, searching him for hesitation.“Are you reading my mind to see if I am lying?” He chuckled. She turned her face away in shame, but he caught her chin as she retreated, pulling her back to him. “No. Like I said, you don’t apologize for anything.” He leaned forward slowly, allowing ample time for her to pull away before she pushed in, meeting him in a soft kiss. He grasped her arm firmly, holding her still as they reconnected.“I love you Arthur.” It was a breathy whisper against his lips. He smiled before kissing her chastely once more.“I love you too, my Mollywobbles.” They pulled away from each other and stood, readjusting their wrinkled clothes.“They’re going to think we did so much more than kiss if we go down like this.” She grumbled, straightening her skirt. Arthur laughed as he fixed his sweater.“Do you think it will be any better if we change?” He asked. She tossed one of the throw pillows at him, laughing. Hand in hand they made their way down the stairs and into the living room. It was empty, but the voices from the dining room led them quickly to find their family. Their children were gathered around the table, laughing as they ate dinner. One face surprised them, as he hadn’t joined them downstairs often over the last two months since Fred had died. George sat beside Walter, carrying on a lively conversation as they ate. Millie was sat beside Ginny, enjoying having an older sister to be around. Al sat in Hermione’s lap, babbling around a spoon he had stuck in his mouth. Harry and Hermione had joined them last week, as the cleanup of the ministry had begun, and they were no longer helping the restoration project at Hogwarts. Luna and Neville popped by frequently, Luna simply for visits since she still had a year at school left, but Neville often on ministry business. He had been kind to Molly since her return. They took their seats near the head of the table, joining in on the idle talk of her children. The door behind them opened, revealing Bill and Fleur. She had met Bill’s wife for the first time soon after her return to the Burrow. She had been gracious to Molly, helping her to readjust to life outside of the manor. They often came for dinner and Molly pushed her chair closer to Arthur’s, leaving room for the two of them. Fleur sat beside her, quickly beginning a conversation.“So, how have you been this week?” Her words were still slightly accented with French, but her English had improved much according to Bill. She shifted so that she was facing Fleur a little more, smiling.“It’s been a little hard, but much better than I could have ever hoped for. I expected things to be much… Worse if I ever left there. I am grateful that everyone has been so kind. How has it been at work?” She asked. Fleur had returned to Gringotts’s this week. She laughed, turning to look at Harry.“Much better, now that restoration is complete.” She laughed. Harry threw his hands up in defense, a grin bursting across his face.“I didn’t ask to break into the Lestrange’s vault, or to have to escape on a dragon!” He said, laughing. Molly dropped her fork.“You three did what?” She shrieked. Laughter erupted around the table as Ron and Hermione ducked their heads to try and hide their laughter. Harry threw his back, however, and howled.“There’s the mum we have missed. Glad to see you’re still here to get on to us!” Charlie roared, clapping Molly on the back gently as he passed. She rolled her eyes at this, picking her fork back up. “And by the way, Harry, we had to track and trap that dragon you released. I’m glad you did because it is in a much better place down in the Romanian colony, but do you know how hard it is to transfer them? Couldn’t have gotten it to fly south instead of north?” He asked, picking a plate up and taking a seat next to Percy.“Oh yes, Charlie, I do humbly apologize for not steering the dragon better!” Another round of laughter came from those seated around the table. Molly sat back in her chair some, watching her family interact. She felt Arthur’s hand slide onto her knee, his eyes fixed on her. She turned to look at him, placing her hand over his.“You alright?” He asked, lacing their fingers together. She nodded, squeezing his fingers.“Yeah. I just missed this, is all.” She smiled softly, eyes falling on George and Walter. George was laughing at what Walter was telling him, his grin an exact imitation of his older brother’s. They ate the rest of their dinner between bouts of laughter as they told stories from their time at school. Molly listened, enraptured, as she was given a glimpse into the years she had missed. Her eyes glanced to the clock on the wall. After they had returned home they had found Fred’s hand on the floor and gave it to George, who wore it on a cord around his neck. The remaining hands including her three children she had brought back, with the addition of one for Harry and Hermione, all pointed towards home now.“We are going to need a bigger clock, honey.” She said, resting her hand onto her stomach. Bill’s eyes flicked to her movement and his eyes darkened. She knew what he was thinking, he had made it clear when they had gone to the manor for her children. Neither she nor they were responsible for what had occurred, but he had wished it was him who had killed Macnair for what he had done. He had been so gentle with the children, however, excited for more siblings. He hadn’t let their age gap interfere as he bonded with them. She let out a yawn that she tried to cover, realizing how late it must me.“I need to get the kids to bed.” She stood, setting her plate in the sink.“We can put them down, Mum!” Ginny offered, picking Millie up and settling her onto her hip. Hermione stood with Al, taking Walter’s hand.“Goodnight, George!” He said, standing to go with the girls.“Thank you.” They waved goodnight as they took the kids upstairs. Nia appeared and began clearing the dishes away, cleaning as she went.“Come on you, to bed it is.” Arthur stood, taking her hand in his. She hugged each of her remaining children goodnight, not excluding Harry or Fleur as she left. She followed Arthur up the stairs and into their room, changing for bed. Curled up together, the fell asleep.

Molly sat in the armchair of the living room, attempting to knit by hand around her rapidly expanding middle. She had difficulty exactly seeing the stiches she was attempting, tossing it to the side in frustration. She tried to stand, barely making it up as the counterweight of her belly tried to push her back into the chair. Ginny had taken the children out today to bond with them, leaving Molly in an empty house. Everyone else had returned to work, attempting to repair the damage the Dark Lord had caused in his time in power. She made her way to the kitchen as her stomach grumbled, looking for something to eat. She heard the sound of someone apparating in the yard and reflexively pulled her wand out. Arthur popped his head into the door, startling Molly.“Merlin, Arthur, you gave me a fright!” She said, lowering the wand. He didn’t respond as he entered the kitchen, grabbing her hand. “Arthur, what is going on?” She could see that he was worried, wringing his hand around his wand.“You have to come with me, Molly. They’re forming a council. You are going to be put on trial, along with some others. I am supposed to take you in. But Harry and Hermione are there and are arguing in your defense. Ultimately the decision lays with the Wizengamot. I am sorry, darling, but I need your wand.” She handed it over to him, her shoulder sinking. So, this was the end of it. Her time had come, to pay for her crimes. She followed him to the fireplace, using the floo network to reach the Ministry of Magic as she was too far along to safely apparate. When they arrived, they were met by security, her wand confiscated off of Arthur and the two were led down to the courtrooms. At the door they were separated, Arthur being taken to a bench seat for viewing and Molly to a chair in the center of the room for interrogation. Once she sat shackles sprang to life, pinning her hands to the armrest of the chair. There were others present, the Malfoy’s among them. Others she knew who had been under the Imperious curse and not freely under the influence of the Dark Lord. She could see others from her family amongst the rows, watching.“Now that we are all present, I would like to bring forth today’s deliberation. Before us sit those who have been proven to serve the Dark Lord under duress only, whether through the Imperious curse, Unbreakable Vows, or threat upon life or loved ones. I will hear from the Wizengamot now.” An older woman stood, all eyes turning towards her.“For those under the Imperious curse, I say that they should be released. Their actions were not their own.” Murmurs of agreement rang out. The man sitting in the chair just before the accused banged his gavel onto the desk, the bonds of most of the accused releasing. They stood and left, some crying as they were acquitted. The empty chairs disappeared, the remaining pulling closer together and forward. “As for those who served under duress, their actions should be examined and decided.” A few more were told to leave, that their interrogation would continue in private. That left Molly and the Malfoy’s before the Wizengamot. Another wizard stood.“The Malfoy’s are known Death Eaters, during both wars. They should be cast into Azkaban for their crimes!”“Yes, but they did defect and aid us in the final battle. Their information could help to find the remaining Death Eaters who elude capture. And their son is barely an adult, forced to take a side he was raised to believe was correct. It is a proven fact that Severus Snape, acting as a double agent for Dumbledore, killed him at his request so that the boy would not be guilty of such a crime. His only proven crime up until this point was taking the Dark Mark to begin with. I say that they should go free, to remain under constant monitoring, and be used to locate other members.” Sounds of agreement sounded around them.“Do you agree with these terms?” The Malfoy’s nodded, deflating in relief as they were freed from their bonds. Leaving Molly alone before the Wizengamot. She swallowed thickly, watching the members assembled before her.“You alone have received the most pressure to be freed. And as much as I would personally like to let you go, nepotism cannot be the only reason you walk free. We will look at your crimes.” She lowered her head.“If you are going to send me to Azkaban, do it. I bear the Dark Mark, that alone is sufficient evidence. I did horrible things. I tortured a child. My actions killed several muggles. I fought for the Dark Lord. I am guilty, so just punish me.” She could hear an angry outburst from Arthur.“What I want to know is why you did it.” He spoke.“I made an Unbreakable Vow with Walden Macnair. That I would obey my orders as they were given if my family were protected.” He cocked his head to the side, his eyes flicking to someone behind her.“What happened before this occurred?” He asked.“I was abducted from my home in September of Nineteen ninety-two. He took me to fulfill a marriage proposal he had made our last year at Hogwarts. He forced me to marry him.” She pulled the hem of her dress, revealing his initials. “He branded me. Took my wand away. Beat and raped me every night. He gave me an option. I could obey and protect my family, or he could continue punishing me and they would pay for it. So, I sold my soul. I would again every time. Every day if it meant they were any safer. He forcibly impregnated me multiple times. And in the year he was locked in Azkaban, I was passed around between the remaining Death Eaters. So, if your question is if I chose to be a Death Eater? Yes. If it was that I was given a real option, the answer is no.” She sunk into her chair, awaiting his response.“How does the Wizengamot find the defendant?” He asked. A few raised their hands as he called guilty, but it was vastly outweighed by those who found her to be innocent. As the gavel banged and her hands were released, she bowed forward into a sob. Familiar hands wrapped around her own, pulling her into his chest. She felt her wand being placed into her pocket as he helped her to stand.“Let’s go home, my love.” He leaned her against him, supporting her as they made their way towards the fireplaces in the atrium. When they arrived the rest of her family were there waiting. Arthur helped her onto the couch, sitting beside her and pulling her as close to himself as he could. Conversations filled the air around them as they settled.“I mean just think about it though, I could’ve introduced you like this ‘Ah yeah, this is my mother, a convicted felon. She almost went to wizard prison but now she just makes us sandwiches.’ And then you come out, scarred, and tattooed up like, ‘would you like tuna or peanut butter?” Molly laughed, cuffing the back of Ron’s head. His eyes flashed to the Dark Mark on her arm. Soon after the Dark Lord’s death all the color had faded from it, now resembling closer to a scar than a tattoo.“Hey Mum, does that mean I can get tattoos?” He asked.“Absolutely not, young man!” She laughed. She felt Arthur squeeze her leg gently. She turned to face him, her smile dropping at the tears in his eyes.“What is it?” She asked, her hand covering his.“I thought I was going to lose you again today. Bill had to restrain me… I was so close to cursing the Wizengamot members who voted guilty… I can’t lose you again.” He started to cry. Molly pulled him close, her hand cupped around his cheek as she kissed him lightly.“I am here. I do not plan on going anywhere, Arthur. We have the rest of our lives.” She kissed him again, deepening it as he grasped her waist.“Oh, for the love of Merlin, go find a room!” George yelled, tossing a pillow at them. Arthur picked the pillow up and threw it back, hitting George in the face.“This is our house, George, and we will do what we like where we please. How do you think you came about?” He turned to Molly, winking. “Wasn’t that the time on the table?” He asked. She slapped his arm in shock, her other going to cover her mouth.“YOU DID WHAT ON THE TABLE?” Ron shrieked, his face green. Bill and Charlie were chuckling, faces red as they looked at each other shaking their heads.“We cleaned it well, of course, and you have been eating off of it just fine the last twenty years.” Molly mumbled. She smacked Arthur again lightly on the arm as he fell into another round of laughter. Molly buried her face into his shoulder, as bright red as her hair. The laughter around them abated some as Arthur wrapped his arm around her softly, kissing the top of her head. The kids let their gaze linger on their parents for a moment before looking away. Charlie watched a second longer before he too found himself occupied with the children on the floor. As wonderful as they were, he couldn’t help but think where their lives might have been if their mum hadn’t been taken. As he lowered himself to the floor beside Walter he looked the boy over, noting how different he looked from the rest of them. His hair was nearly black and his eyes lighter than theirs, favoring his biological father’s. But so much was the same as them, as well. And as far as their characteristics and mannerisms, they were as Weasley as any of them.Molly grabbed Arthur’s hand gently, leaning to whisper into his ear. They excused themselves from the room, trailing quietly out of the room. Molly followed behind Arthur up the stairs, Arthur slowing some to match her limp. They made it to the room, shutting the door behind them and changing quietly into their nightclothes. She sat onto the bed, exhausted from what had occurred today. Arthur sat down beside her, rubbing her aching back gently. She moaned a little as his hands worked her sore muscles, easing the knots under her skin.“Are you alright?” He asked, working on a rather large one as she leaned back against him.“Just tired. The last few years have taken their toll, and I was sure I would be spending tonight in Azkaban.” His hands stopped, instead reaching around to cup her abdomen softly. He leaned over her shoulder, placing a kiss against her neck.“I would have fought anyone who stood between you and me, if that had been the verdict.” She leaned her head against his, chuckling softly. He kissed her neck again, sucking for a moment on the pulse of her neck. She moaned, rolling her head the other way, and giving him more room. He stopped, pulling away.“What is it, Arthur?” She asked, turning to face him. He was looking at his hands, refusing to meet her eyes. She pulled his face up softly, stroking his cheek with her thumb. “What’s wrong?”“I can’t get that memory out of my head. Of Macnair hurting you, when he looked like me. The despair in your eyes as he, as I, hurt you.” She caught him as he tried to pull away.“It wasn’t you, though. And it never would have been. You could never do that to me, Arthur.” She leaned forward, kissing him softly. It took him a moment to respond but he kissed her back, his arm wrapping around her waist and pulling her closer to him. He was brought up forth, however, as her protruding belly stopped him. She laughed, breaking the kiss. “Replace his touch with yours.” She offered, drawing his free hand up to cup her breast softly. He held it there for a minute before pulling it away.“Are you absolutely sure you are ready for this?” He asked. They had not been together like this since her return, more than content enough to lay tangled as close as possible to each other every night. He didn’t ask again as his hand cupped her breast, kneading it as he kissed her deeply. He lowered her against the mattress, his hand sliding up her body to cup her cheek as he kissed her. She began unbuttoning his shirt, pushing it down his arms. He sat back on his knees, removing the shirt, and collecting some pillows to place behind her so she would lay angled upwards, so that the child wasn’t pushing so heavily on her lungs. He stood to remove the rest of his clothes, helping to slide her out of the nightdress she wore. He had seen her scars, of course, but not in this lighting he saw them in now. The air escaped his lungs as he looked at the one that crossed her entire body, sitting stoically onto the bed.“I am sorry, Molly, that I couldn’t protect you.” He trailed his fingers over the scar, slowing as he felt her skin tense beneath it. “Are you alright?” He asked, pulling his hand back.“I am fine, Arthur. That reaction wasn’t fear, it was pleasure. The skin around the scars is sensitive to touch and mixed with what we were doing I responded. I am sorry.” He shook his head, stroking down the scar softly. He moved up her abdomen to a dark but fairly small scar, circling around it. He looked to her, her eyes hidden behind her lashes. “Stab wound from Rodolphus.” She answered. She could nearly hear his thoughts aloud. He moved up and to the left, kissing along another thick scar that ran under her breast. “Goyle did that.” He traced further up, stalling on the initials under her collarbone. He didn’t need any explanation for that, kissing his way past it and across to her shoulder. He followed the long scar down her arm to her wrist with the trail of kisses, stalling at her fingers. He moves to her other hand, kissing upwards but pulling back unexpectedly.“What?” She asked, moving to sit up. He shook his head, running over to his chest of drawers and digging through it.“I had forgotten!” He said, searching for something. He pulled back with a laugh, returning to his spot beside Molly. “Will you marry me?” He asked, pulling out a ring. She nearly cried as she nodded, pulling him in to kiss her. He slid the ring over her finger, setting it firmly in the spot it had lived for over twenty years. “You know, this year makes thirty.” He told her, returning his attention to her body. He kissed the scarred remainder of the Dark Mark softly, before pushing himself down the bed and to her legs. The skin from her ankles to her knees were discolored some, a bright pink compared to her white skin.“Goyle burned me for failing a mission.” She stated. He kissed across the scars, moving his way up. He stalled at her knee, rubbing it gently as he looked to her.“I want the real story of how this happened.” She chuckled lightly, bumping him with her good leg.“Rodolphus did that. Broke my knee during that torture… He makes a shit healer.” She laughed, shaking her head. Arthur didn’t laugh as he continued to massage her knee. He began to move upwards again, stalling at the large scar on the inside of her thigh. “Same day my knee broke. He… He took a knife and cut a strip of skin off entirely.” Arthur closed his eyes, trying to push the image away. He kissed the border around the scar, his fingers tracing patterns into the opposite thigh. He could hear her breathing grow heavier as he neared her knickers, tugging on them softly with his fingers. He drew them off of her before settling between her legs, planting a soft kiss to the skin of her thighs on either side. She grasped the bedsheet underneath her, twisting her fingers into it as he settled his mouth against her slit. She cried out, hips bucking as he began to lick her.“Oh, fuck! Arthur!” She moaned. He wrapped his arms around her hips, holding her in place as he continued to suck and lick. He probed her gently, pushing his tongue into her as she gasped. “Merlin!” She was nearly breathless as she attempted to buck her hips again. One hand slid up her body to her breast and played with her nipple, drawing a strained moan from her. Something inside her seemed to click into place as he drove her headfirst towards an orgasm. She was home. She looked down towards him, finding his eyes focused entirely on her. She clenched a bit at that, a whine escaping from her throat. The hand still settled around her waist pushed a bit further down, his fingers sliding into her slick folds. She cried out, her hands releasing their grip on the sheets and tangling into Arthur’s short hair as she urged him onward. He slid a third finger into her, curling them gently as she broke around him. She was nearly screaming as she came, her thighs tightening roughly around Arthur as she arched her back. Her head rolled back against the pillows as Arthur thrust his fingers into her, prolonging her orgasm. Gasping, she came down, finding his eyes still focused on her through all of it.“Merlin, I missed this. You were beautiful, Molly.” He voice was a bit raspy as he pulled himself up her body, licking his way towards her mouth. As he settled himself between her thighs she could feel his erection, exciting her. She pulled him into a kiss, tasting herself on his tongue. She moaned as he rolled a nipple between his fingers, biting his lip softly. His hand came to rest on her cheek, his thumb tracing the scar across it.“Bellatrix.” She whispered. He kissed along the scar softly, his other hand moving down between them to reposition himself. Her head fell back as he pushed into her, his falling into the crook of her neck as they moaned. He gave her a moment to adjust, relishing in the feeling of them reconnecting like this for the first time in years. She bucked her hips gently, letting him know she was ready. He tangled his left hand with hers, holding tightly as he thrust slowly into her body. His other hand held her hip as she tightened her legs around him, pulling him as close as their bodies would allow. He groaned as he pushed into her as deep as he could, holding there for a moment. He set a moderate pace, torn between going full force and having her scream as she finished and taking this slow, reconnecting. She moaned as he readjusted his stance, rotating his hips some into a more comfortable position. The hand that had rested on her hip he placed on the headboard, changing his angle inside of her. She screamed his name, tightening around him some as he pushed her closer to her end. He wouldn’t last much longer either, he knew that. He leaned forward, kissing along the line of her neck before biting down gently on her pulse point.“Fuck, Arthur!” She gasped, her legs tightening around him for a minute. Her free hand reached up, pulling Arthur down to her by the back of his neck. She kissed him softly as he drove into her, her orgasm crashing through her body. She pressed her forehead against his as she screamed, her body tightening around Arthur’s in a vicelike grip. He came as well, moaning as his hand fell from the headboard. He rolled so that he didn’t lay on top of her, instead switching them so that she sat atop him. They both stayed there a moment, breathing heavily as they came down from their orgasms. As he softened inside of her she shifted, falling to lay on the bed beside him. He pulled his wand off of the table and cleaned the mess, pulling Molly closer to him.“Are you alright, Mollywobbles?” He asked. She nodded into his chest, the exhaustion catching up with her. He pulled the blankets up over them, repositioning the pillows to a more comfortable spot behind them. The door opened softly, Bill calling out.“Hey, Fleur and I are going to head home for the night. You two rest well, we will see you in a couple days, alright?” The answered tiredly and as Bill began to shut the door they heard quietly, “And for Ron and Percy’s sake, you may want to cast a silencing charm next time.” The door shut behind him as Molly pushed her face into Arthur’s chest, dark red.“Oh, Merlin, those poor boys.” She moaned. Arthur chuckled softly, pulling her closer towards him.“They’ll get over it, dear.” He said, tracing his fingers up her arm softly.“I love you, Arthur.” She whispered, readjusting so that she could kiss his lips gently before snuggling her head back against his chest.“I love you too, Mollywobbles.” He replied, kissing her softly on the top of the head, his hand settling to rest across her belly.

Molly entered the living room, a stack of presents tottering in her hands. Arthur rushed to help her, passing them to the named recipients as Bill stood to help pass them out as well. It had been five years since the Battle of Hogwarts and in that time, their family had grown. Molly had delivered twin girls that December, named Abigail and Lauren. The next summer, on the anniversary of the war’s end, Bill and Fleur had a daughter they named Victoire in remembrance of the battle. Since then, Dominique and Louis joined their family. George had married Angelina Johnson the next year, their son Fred coming soon after. Percy’s fiancée, Audrey, had joined them this year as well. Charlie had tried to bring his ‘children’ along, but Molly had firmly told him that baby dragons in onesies did not count as grandchildren, so he was attending alone. Ron had Hermione had married two years before, as they had pushed the wedding out as they continued to help rebuild the ministry in the years after the war. Harry and Ginny’s wedding was approaching in the coming summer, which had Molly hard at work preparing the back garden for the event.Walter was now ten years old, and excitedly waiting for his upcoming year at Hogwarts. The boy had grown much in that time, his hair somewhat shaggy, down to his ears. His eyes were still the spitting image of Walden’s but held the same humor as Arthur. Arthur had adopted all of the children just hours after the birth of the twins. Millie was now eight, her bright red hair curling below her shoulders. Her eyes matched Molly’s, but not much else had remained. She looked more like Macnair but held the personality of Arthur. Al had grown the most, towering over his younger sister. She still did not know who his biological father was, but at the lack of Lycanthropy she could safely assume it was most likely not Greyback. The twins had Macnair’s dark hair, but her soft brown eyes. Their faces were more rounded, like hers, as well, but their noses were angular and long.“Mum? You alright?” Charlie caught her attention as he took the remaining stack of presents out of her hand, helping her to sit beside Arthur on the couch.“Yeah, sorry. Just thinking.” She answered. Arthur grasped her knee gently, pulling her attention to him.“About what?” He asked quietly. She pushed the image of all of them into his mind, smiling as his eyes softened. “Yeah, they’re pretty good, aren’t they?” He responded, squeezing her leg gently.“I would surely say so. How could they not be? I made them myself.” She laughed. The assembled family members tore into their presents, excitedly pulling their Weasley sweaters out and putting them on. Molly helped Arthur shrug his on, laughing as it became stuck over his glasses. He helped her put hers on as well, settling her against him once she was done.“Thanks, Mum!” Bill said as he sported his, Fleur laughing. Her children helped their kids into their own sweaters, and soon, they all stood matching in variously colored Weasley sweaters.“This calls for a picture, huh, Mum?” Percy asked, pulling out a camera. He had been much kinder since both of their returns to the family after the war. He took every opportunity to spend time with her and making sure there were plenty of family photos to decorate their houses with. The kids stood and positioned themselves around the couch, the camera floating a few feet away as they smiled. The flash went off, signaling it was done. Abigail came over to her, pulling herself up into Molly’s lap.“Yes dear?” She asked, readjusting her some.“I love you, Mumma. And you, Dadda.” She stated, hugging the both of them. She slid off the couch and rejoined Lauren, playing with some of the toys their older siblings had gotten them. She watched them warmly, enjoying the interaction between the older siblings and younger, as well as the grandchildren. It didn’t escape her notice that her children would attend Hogwarts with her grandchildren, even causing her to laugh at the thought. Arthur turned to her; his eyebrow raised.“And what, may I ask, do you find so funny?” He asked.“Just that we are much too old to have children this young.” She stated. Her heart ached a bit at the absence of Fred, who should be here, with the rest of his siblings. Arthur shook his head a bit, chuckling.“As long as we are all together, I don’t mind too much.” He answered. Nia entered the room, cleaning away some of the trash from the morning’s festivities.“Thank you, Nia.” Molly said, handing her a bit of wrapping that was beside her on the couch.“Not a problem at all, Mistress Molly!” She said, taking the trash from her. “Dinner will be ready soon, Mistress.” She said, leaving the room with her trash. Hermione came to sit beside her, shrugged warmly in her Weasley sweater.“How are you doing, Molly?” She asked as she sat.“Well enough, I guess. I am enjoying having everyone over today. It’s nice just spending time with them.” She answered. Hermione nodded, watching Ron play with the twins. A smile crossed her face. “Thinking about some of your own?” Molly asked. Hermione shook her head a bit, blushing.“Not soon, no. But maybe in the next few years once everything is truly settled.” She responded. Molly nodded.“I am so grateful for my family. The way they welcomed the kids with open arms… I got pretty lucky.” She swallowed thickly, trying not to cry.“I wouldn’t say you were just lucky… I think a lot of that had to do with how you raised them. They are pretty good.” She laughed, watching Ron get tackled by Millie, who had snuck up behind him while the twins distracted him. Fleur sat beside Hermione, filling the couch.“How are you feeling, Fleur?” It had only been a few months since Louis’ birth, and it had been difficult for Fleur. She waved her hand softly.“Things are getting better. My body is finally healing, but I definitely think this is the end of children for us.” She answered, watching as Ginny doted on the baby.“Be careful, I said that and had five more.” Molly told her, laughing. Fleur shook her head, hands in the air.“Do not put that onto me, Molly Weasley!” She chuckled. Bill watched them contentedly, enjoying the relationship his wife had built with his mother. She had come for the birth of the twins, helping as Molly healed. In return, Molly had been there for every one of her births, doing anything Fleur needed the second she asked. Charlie sat on the arm of the chair beside him, earning a hard stare from his mother. Laughing, he waved to her before turning to talk to Bill.“It’s nice having her back, huh?” He asked. Bill nodded, his eyes falling to Victoire and Dominique on the floor.“Those few years she was gone was hard on all of us, but especially Dad.” He went quiet, thinking about his father during that time. For months after her disappearance, he had just been gone. Walking around with dull eyes, hard to get a response from. He knew it had been bad, the scene left behind from the attack and he never asked about it. He remembered one night when Ron had asked about it over the summer after his second year. Bill had been housing them during their trip in Egypt. His father had gone white as a ghost, his eyes held a horror Bill never wanted to understand. He had sent all the kids to bed after that, bringing a glass of firewhiskey to him. He had cried, the only time Bill had ever recalled him doing so before Mum had come back. A hand on his shoulder brought him back to the present. Fleur was standing over him, her eyes concerned.“Are you alight, Bill?” She asked. He nodded, placing his hand over hers. “Okay. Dinner is ready if you would like to join us.” He stood, scooping Victoire up in his arms as he made his way towards the kitchen. The table had been extended to fit their entire family; extra chairs added as they grew in number. Molly tried to stand, accepting Arthur’s proffered hand, and allowing him to pull her to her feet. She limped slowly behind him, bringing up the rear as everyone made their way into the kitchen. He helped her to sit before taking his chair beside her, his hand never leaving hers. Charlie watched them fondly, amazed by the absolute tenderness with which he had always treated her. Nia snapped her fingers, and with a loud CRACK the table before them filled with food. They dug in, filling their plates with whatever they desired as chatter filled the air around them. Molly pulled a bit of turkey and cherry sauce onto her plate, enjoying the taste as she dug in. Once she had swallowed her bite she turned to Nia, smiling.“It tastes delicious, Nia. Thank you.” More gratuities rang out around the table.“Not a problem, Mistress Molly.” She answered. As plates emptied she cleared them, the table before them thinning in selections. Once the last of the dinner plates were removed the table filled with desserts and once-full bellies seemed to empty at the new pickings. Molly took a bit of treacle tart for herself, picking at it slowly as she talked with Ginny. She had recently joined the Holyhead Harpies and was off of training for the week. Her first match was approaching in March, and she was asking if they would be joining some of her siblings in attendance.“Absolutely. I wouldn’t dream of missing out on watching my daughter wipe the field with the other team.” She answered, taking another bite of her treacle tart. Her attention was turned to Percy as he spoke about his promotion, surprised with the humility he had learned over the years.“Honestly I don’t even deserve it, but Hermione keeps telling them I am the only one for the job. I hope I can do right this time.” He answered his father’s question. Audrey grasped his hand firmly.“Well, Perc, I would say you have done a lot of growing in these last few years.” George replied, a grin breaking across his face. “Yeah, I can definitely see it now.” He picked up his hands, pretending to frame Percy for a picture. “Your body finally grew into that big old head of yours!” Laughter erupted around the table as Percy turned a light pink, laughing along with the others.“Well, I am glad to know it now fits.” He said, shaking his head. Molly laughed, watching the interaction, feeling lighter than she had in some time. Around the table, most couples had a hold of each other’s hands and Molly turned as Arthur raised hers, bringing it gently to his lips.“I just wanted to let you know that I love you, Molly Weasley, and I am thankful every day that you chose me. Even when we were apart, you found your way back.” He whispered, placing another kiss against her hand. She leaned forward and captured his lips with hers, her free hand cupping his face softly.“I love you too, Arthur Weasley, and I am grateful that you asked me to marry you, welcoming me home with open arms.” She answered, settling back into her chair. The kids watched the interaction as their parents settled, eyes never leaving one another. Hermione squeezed Ron’s hand softly, tears forming in her eyes as she looked away from them. He squeezed back, bringing their hands so that they rested on his leg. Conversations began to bubble gently around the table again as they broke eye contact, each drawn into their own discussions with separate children. A knock at the door caught Molly’s attention. She went to answer it, shocked as it opened to reveal Narcissa and Draco.“Narcissa! Please, come in. Where is Lucius?” She asked, opening the door wider to allow them to enter.“Hello, Molly. I am sorry to barge in unannounced like this, but we didn’t really have anywhere else to go. Lucius was taken to Azkaban a few nights ago since the rest of the Death Eaters have been captured. It was decided that his crimes were too many to allow him to walk free. They declared Draco and I free, however, and well. I just didn’t have anywhere to go. If you would like us to leave, of course we will.” She responded. Molly shook her head, waving for them to come inside.“Absolutely not. Despite what occurred, you befriended me and tried your best to protect me. You are always welcome here.” Narcissa bowed a bit as she entered, Draco nodding to her gratefully as they entered. She had told her family countless times about the kindness Narcissa had shown her, and they greeted her warmly as Bill pulled another chair up to the table. Draco stood awkwardly for a moment, unsure of what to do, before Harry moved aside and pulled a chair up beside him. Draco sat, nodding his thanks as he took his seat at the table. Conversation resumed as Narcissa interacted with Fleur and Ginny, Draco caught up somewhat uncomfortably in a conversation with Harry and Hermione. He seemed to relax some, however, as the night went on. As they returned to the living room he joined some of the siblings in a board game, easing into camaraderie with them. Narcissa watched on, a sense of peace emanating from her.“So, what have you gotten up to recently?” Molly inquired. She hadn’t seen Narcissa since the trial, as she had been under watch as they worked to discover the whereabouts of the remaining Death Eaters.“I took a portion of the money from Lucius’ vault and bought myself a little home up near Liverpool. I am enjoying it immensely, trying to make it into a real home. Draco has been dabbling in a couple of things, trying to find what he really enjoys. He is seeing a young woman named Astoria Greengrass, and I think that soon he may ask her to marry him.” Molly smiled.“I hope to hear about a wedding soon, then. I am glad that he is finding out who he wants to be. That he isn’t letting what happened keep him from being happy.” She felt Arthur’s hand on her leg and wrapped her fingers around his softly. Narcissa smiled in return, her eyes falling to Draco as he entered a mock-argument with Ron about the game that resulted in both of them laughing.“Me too. He deserves happiness, despite what he may think.” Her eyes turned to the twins.“They are beautiful, Molly.” She said, wrapping her hands around her knees. Molly yawned gently, Arthur setting his hand on her shoulder.“You are tired, my love. Time for bed.” He helped her to stand and led her from the room, saying their goodbyes to the family. Some would stay the night, others returning to their own homes for bed. She offered a spare room for Narcissa and Draco, which they politely declined. She waved to them as she ascended the staircase, hand in hand with Arthur. Once they were in their room he helped her to change into her nightclothes, setting her onto the sheets and pulling the blanket up over her. He changed and slid in beside her, pulling her close to him.“So, was it a good Christmas?” He asked. She nodded, curling into his warmth.“It was nice having all of the kids here, and I was glad to see Draco warm up to them. I think it would do him some good, to have friends like our boys.” He hugged her gently, kissing the top of her head.“Just think, Mollywobbles… The rest of our lives together.” He whispered. “I love you so much.” She pressed her forehead against his chest softly.“I love you too, Arthur. More than you could ever know.” She whispered back, entwining her fingers with his. As she lay there, listening to his breathing deepen into gentle snores, she couldn’t help but to think how truly lucky she was. -End-
