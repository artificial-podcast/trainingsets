  May 2, 2001

He can't feel or think or do anything.
It was all rather colorless. It is black and white, and Draco fucking loathes how bleak life has gotten.
It had never been sunshine and rainbows, but at least he had been able to know there was color, know that it was a beautiful thing. But, now it is dull. The faint tinges of color that once were are undetectable.
There used to be this ambition in him; it used to be his fuel. It made him burn. It was a sweet type of burn. It was what made him Draco Malfoy. But after a certain amount of pain and trauma, a person begins to wither away until they are a shadow of who they used to be.
He loathes this. Loathes his life, being here, loathes being surrounded by people who look so damn happy. He envies them for being able to move on. Envies them for being so resilient.
It's hard being resilient when he clings to things. He holds onto the torture he endured.
It pains him to hold onto the things that caused him pain, but if it were not for it, he would not be able to feel anything. There is no love for him. Not an atom. Mum died, and she was his only source of adoration, but she is long gone now. His father never truly loved him, if he is being quite honest. But then again, Draco never really loved him either. What kind of father forces his son to torture and kill for a sorry excuse of a man?
Remembering is what he has got going. Feeling the pain and guilt about everything is what he has. It is what gets him out of bed in the morning. It gives him a purpose. The only thing he wishes is for it to be a whole other reason.
He wishes he could feel some other emotion. Feel something that does not relate to the things he had seen happen in his home: the place that was stripped of its warmth and love.

  Glee, excitement, satisfaction, affection.

But happiness was never in the question. The only time Draco had seen even a glimpse of rapture was when he had seen her crossing the street to go to Flourish & Blotts a few months ago. He did not know why, or what it meant because since when? It just happened, and now it has left him confused. He can't explain it, never been able to read his own emotions.

  
    
  


  
    
  

It was like this burst of happiness that had been compressed finally exploded within him when he saw her curls move with the wind.
He does not openly seek her out or anything of the sort. He just admires her when he gets the chance — not that he has had many. Maybe twice since the war ended, because he'd never really had a chance before.
So, he stands here on Potter's porch — clutching his glass like a lifeline — trying to pretend like he is just as fine as them. That he has healed like them, the way he is supposed to.

  
    
  


  
    
  

The music blaring is a steady thrum against his back. He can hear them yelling to the music in sheer joy. Can feel the house move as they jumped to the beat of the song. It is all white noise in his ears, though.
Why did he come here? He forgot.
He doesn't feel like hanging around them, doesn't feel like he belongs. Not like he hadn't spent most of his childhood bullying them because he was jealous.
He doesn't even know why he is here. Doesn't know why he accepted the invitation. Doesn't know why the invitation was given to him anyway.
He had apologized to Potter and Weasley. He said the classic sorry for the shit I saidapology. And they had accepted it, so it must have been good enough. But he had been truly sorry for everything.

  
    
      
    
  


  
    
      
    
  

Then he got the owl asking him to join them in a remembrance party. To celebrate those who died because they would not want them to wallow. Because they know what fucking dead people would want. But he knew they would want him dead. That's okay, though, because he wants himself dead too.
His lips curl bitterly.
That's one thing they have in common.
But they would never know how disgusting he feels or how badly he wants to take it all back. They would never know the lengths he would go to.
There wasn't anything to celebrate when none of them would be dead had he taken Dumbledore's help, had he grown a fucking pair and said no, had Draco been a better person, had he just done something that would make him redeemable.

  
    
  


  
    
  

And he just feels bitter leaning against a wall while hearing everyone have the time of their lives. Because, although they lost loved ones too, they had been on the right side of the war, and they were welcomed in their society. Because of his actions, he has been made a pariah in a world he thought he would rule one day.
Standing inside had made him feel suffocated, and it felt like his lungs had been squeezed as punishment for his sins. Though he knows he deserves it, he still had walked outside and tried to set them free. Because, while he made all the wrong choices and chose to listen to all the wrong people, he still feels he deserves to breathe. Maybe he can be redeemed.
So, he stands on the corner of the porch, waiting until it is polite to leave.
She walks out the front door and gently sits on the steps. Curls bouncing and breath creating a cloud in the air.
It's cold.
The wind howls like a werewolf on the full moon. The wind whips through the trees, swaying like a wave. Snow crystals fall through the air, gliding, and landing on her umber mane.
She shrugs her coat off — gently sighs in the frosty weather. Probably loves that it chills her — needs it.
He loves the way it feels almost as much as he loves the way it looks. The snow falls — heavy and thick. It seems wet as it lands on her, and he can't help but love the way it looks on her. It falls gracefully all around her — magnificent.
A smirk plays on his lips.
"Trying to catch a cold?"
She whips her head towards his voice. She goes still when she sees who it is. And he can't fathom why it is she looks so beautiful when surprised.
She studies him. He's standing there with fire whiskey in one hand and the other in his trouser pocket. His pale blonde hair is tousled — looks intentional. He's got a smirk plastered on his face — one that he sure tells her he is amused. His eyes crinkle just in the slightest because of her.
She purses her lips.
"It's only May."
"But you can see your breath, so I'll hazard a guess and say it's freezing."
He doesn't know why he has just asked her that, but Draco figures he loves how she reacts and wants to see how many he can get out of her.
He snorts, and the cock of her umber eyebrow makes his smirk widen.
A few minutes later, he decides to walk towards her. His footsteps are soft and precise. She turns her head just as he sits by her. Not close enough to touch her but close enough for him to feel her body heat radiating from her like a candle. It's only just a bit.
He takes a sip from his drink, lets it linger on his tongue before it creeps down his throat.
She stares at him.
"Why aren't you getting pissed like the rest of the clan," he asks. He is genuinely curious. He never thought Granger would be one to dance on tabletops, but a light sway of her hips while drunk, he wouldn't put past her.
She looks quite annoyed. Perhaps, she doesn't want to speak to Draco, doesn't want to be near him. He couldn't blame her, but he just needed to hear her sweet voice. It'll be like honey to his ears, and he just wants to have something positive.
"They want to forget," she finally says. She sounds like she's honest, but Draco has never taken her for a liar, so it isn't a surprise. There was no malice or venom in her voice.
He cocks a pale eyebrow in question.
"I don't."
The statement was brief but spoke volumes to him. To someone who knows what Granger means. Who understands on a personal level.
He wants to tell her he understands, wants to do something to make her feel better. All their lives, he has done nothing but give her shit and make her life miserable. He wants to change that, he's decided.

  
    
  


  
    
  

He looks away from her — not her but the place above her shoulder. Looks at the trees that are scattered on the lawn. It's a few minutes before he says something else.
Showing her he understands feels like a good thing to do. He thinks it might even ease the tension.
"Pain's the only thing you're feeling right now. No pain, and you'll be numb, which is worse for you," he says quietly.
He says that knowing the feeling. Knowing that the one thing holding him here is the one thing that fucking destroys him. Knowing Granger is wrecking herself too.
She looks at him — confusion etched in her eyes. She contemplates saying whatever is at the tip of her tongue. And for a moment, he thinks she'll let it slip past her lips, but instead, she breathes out and turns her head to look at the steps near her feet.
"Why'd you follow me out here?" she asks.
He understands why she chose not to respond to his claim. She would probably rather not talk about something like that. It is too deep and too intimate in a way. Her feelings are private — she would rather keep them like that.
He doesn't know why he even tried. If it had been any other person on these steps, he wouldn't have initiated a conversation, but because it's Granger, he just felt like he had to. Like it would just give him something.

  
    
  


  
    
  

And maybe it's selfish — talking to her to make him feel something that isn't pain — but it was for her too, he thinks, because what if she needs this too? She's just too stubborn for her own good.
He snorts again like something she said is funny. "I was already here. You just didn't see me," he smirks.
She's cute.
She rolls her eyes.
When she looks at him, he knows she sees his splotchy nose and cheeks that only the cold can cause.
He can see her nose begin to redden from the icy weather, and he can't help but think how adorable it makes her look. The contrast from her freckles does something to him.
"Why don't you want to forget?"
"I just don't," she replies. Her face contorts into something of a misery.
His lips pull into a line, and pale eyebrow arches in the slightest.
"Your side won. Why is it that you look like you've lost? The world is still intact. You are free," he tells her. Somewhat forceful, but confusion laced his tone as well.
He doesn't understand her. She should be thriving, right? The world isn't being ruled by a tyrant. Why is she so miserable.
She goes still — utterly in shock.
"Not really," was all she could manage to say. She got all choked up talking about it.
He looks at her oddly. "How so?"
She frowns.
By the look on her face, she doesn't know why he's here, can't fathom why he cares enough to ask and listen. But he hasn't been heinous in any way tonight, but after everything, he knows that he can't expect her to believe he has changed.
She sighs in resignation. "So many people died, there's not much to celebrate. Wanting to drink and forget them is sort of a rude thing, you know?"
Confused isn't a strong enough word to describe how he's feeling: puzzled, dumbfounded, bewildered.
"I don't."
She moves her gaze from the steps to his grey irises.
"They all died because of me. And fuck because kids shouldn't have been involved," she breaks off. "Most of them were children. Some of them left as orphans." He sees the tears threatening to spill but doesn't do anything. Knows she would recoil from his touch.
"They didn't get to live much before their lives were cut short." A bitter smile graces her lips while she shakes her head, eyes gazing down at her feet. "Children," she whispers.
He didn't know what to say. It is his fault those children died at Hogwarts. His fault she feels this way, and it all just crushes him.
"I'm sorry," he croaks.
She turns her gaze to him — tears trail down her cheeks, carving a clear river. Confusion etches on her face.
"Why are you sorry? I don't need your pity, nor do I want it," she snaps coldly.
Malice finds his way in his words. "Well, you don't have it," he spits.
And he can see the faint glow of the fire in her doe eyes.
She exhales as if to compose herself.
"I'm — I'm sorry," her palms rub her eyes. "I just... fucking hate myself. And everything is so fucked."
He stays silent. Doesn't know what to say to that.
"I fucking hate myself too."
A tense silence settles upon them, a time slowing and breath-holding silence.
"Some wounds are just too deep to heal in a short amount of time or at all," she says quietly. It's like an end to the conversation because they both know.
 

  May 2, 2002

It's unseasonably warm. Usually, it'd be colder, would be able to see the puffs of their breaths in the air.
It is humid, and it made him feel sticky. He had to take his coat off. He'd thought he would need it.
He stands in the same place he did last year. Hand in his pocket with a glass of umber liquid in his palm. The same vibrations on his back and the continuous tap of his foot.
She's sitting on the steps, too. Curled up into a ball, clinging onto her coat like it isn't eighty degrees. He has tried to speak to her, attempted to get her to respond as he did last year, but she's been quiet all night, and he could see her shoulders twitch every once in a while.
He hasn't been able to see her pretty freckles or make her brows furrow. She hasn't looked back at him at all. She'd just slammed the door shut, nearly knocked it off its hinges, and puffed a breath as she dropped onto the steps.
Her hand is tucked in her curls, rubbing or tugging? He couldn't tell.
"What's got your tongue, Granger?"
It's so subtly he barely saw it. Only for his keen eyes and undivided attention is given to her, he wouldn't have seen Granger shrug. He wouldn't have seen the way her shoulders sluggishly lifted for a brief moment.
That's the first response he has gotten since she came outside. It was a rather pathetic answer if you'd ask him, and he isn’t about to take that from Hermione fucking Granger.

  
    
  


  
    
  

"That's fucking pathetic," he says under his breath.
And he hears her scoff, a noise low in her throat that almost sounded like a growl. One of anger or resentment, he couldn't tell.
Her head slowly creeps to the side, him in her periphery. He could see her chest puff in and out in a quick paste. It could have been because she's suffocating in that unnecessary coat or her attempt at controlling her reactions to the bait he's just thrown her.
"Come and kick me while I'm on the ground, Malfoy. I'm sure it'll get the itch you've been dying to scratch."
His brows furrow.
"The fucks your problem?"
A sound leaves her throat, manic and raw. He can't describe it in any other way besides unhinged.
He's never seen her this way. She's usually calm and collected with a fire to her eyes: determined and persistent.
"Yes, because there's always something wrong with me. Can't even get in an argument without it having to be me with a problem," Granger says in an incredulous tone. Her head's titled up like she's speaking to the gods.
"What're you on about?"
She swipes her hand over her lips. A bitter chuckle is the only noise that can be heard.
She fixes her gaze onto him, studies him.
"You truly don't know?" she asks, confused by his confusion.
"What's there to know?"
She shakes her head and turns to sit back down on the steps. And she's laughing. Her head's thrown backward as chuckles escape those pretty pink lips, her shoulders shake. She's hysteric.

  
    
  


  
    
  

He doesn't know whether it's a wave of pride at cracking her icy wall of anger by her outward mockery of his confusion that hits him.
He traipses towards her. She's still cackling like a crazed person. He sits beside her, far enough for her not to be able to touch him.
He goes to speak, but she beats him to it.
"No, you're fucking with me." She shakes her head like he's said some nonsense. "You're not one to play dumb, so just out with it. Mock me or insult me already and carry on."
He cocks a brow, fucking puzzled with everything spilling from her lips.
The only thing that's crystal right now is just how sure he is of never wanting to do any of those things to her. She doesn't deserve it.
"Granger, are you fucking pissed? I don't see what you find so hilarious, nor do I have any intention of fucking with you."
Her laughter turns to giggles and eventually silence.
Now, she looks confused and probably thought he is playing coy.
"You live under a rock, don't you?"
That's fucking rude.
"Do you even bother to keep up with what goes on, or have you isolated yourself from the world?" Though the questions she's asking are incredibly insensitive, the only tone lacing her voice is curiosity. The thing he only ever heard in the classrooms of Hogwarts.
Bitter. That's all Draco feels.
"Would you like to read all about how you're a supposed murderer who deserves to rot in Azkaban," he asks. "Read and listen to your name be slandered left and right by people who don't even know the actual story," he continues, and any signs of mirth on her face have fallen.

  
    
  


  
    
  

He moves his gaze to the leaves on the ground, shakes his head at the irony. Because this year it's him they're talking about, and he bets she felt just as uncomfortable.
"It gets tiring hearing all of this shit. Assumptions are created, and awful shit is said. It all gets to a point where it's too much," he sighs. "They may think I'm a crude, heartless ex Death Eater but they always forget about just how old I was. They forget to listen for my side of the story."

  
    
  


  
    
  

Years of bottling this up, and he's finally cracked the vial. Now, it's all spilling uncontrollably.
"Because I just fucking know they'd make all the same choices I did if it had been their families' lives in danger." He scoffs. "If you could even call it a choice."

  
    
  


  
    
  

It's an uneasy tension that surrounds them, but that doesn't stop him from telling her. Maybe if it's her that knows the truth, she'll think better of him.

  
    
  


  
    
  

"I was a kid that just wanted to save his mum." His throat slightly tightens, and there is a slight pain in his chest as he mentions Mother. "I did what I had to do for our survival. But even through all of that, Voldemort still fucking killed her. She was my only family, so wouldn't have anyone done the same had they been in my position?"
Sometimes, he forgets how biased and unfair the world is. They see black and white in a world with such a broad spectrum of colors. Colors he knows are there, but he can't see because they'd turned dull.
It's silent for a while. She knows just what to say or how to respond to Draco's confession. He said too much.
Nothing but the muffled sounds of the music and cheerful screams can be heard.
She sighs. Like she's resigned or regretful.
"Ron's broken up with me," she says, her voice a pitch higher towards the end of the sentence.
His eyes narrow in confusion because what kind of fool breaks up with a witch such as Hermione Granger?
"Said that I was dragging him down. All I ever do is mope around and that I've got to move on," Granger says, a hint of sorrow in her voice. "Afterwards, he went to Skeeter and got her to write about it on the Prophet." It sounds like she's in agony. "I've gone from being known as a hero to a psychotic ex-girlfriend. Gods, he said the harshest lies anyone has ever said about me." He can hear the tears in her voice but doesn't look at her, doesn't want to make her feel worse.
He can't blame her. Weasley's been her partner for years, and he just dropped her because she's having a hard time coping with the aftermath of the war. But to have it broadcasted to the world with lies that he's sure are ruthless must hit her the hardest. There wasn't any reason to get nasty with it. The war broke her. And the fucking carrot wanted to stomp on the pieces while he had the advantage.
"According to Ron, I'm inconsiderate of his feelings and needs. I should bottle this shit up and give him attention. But I didn't, and now here we are," she laughs sadly. She's fidgeting with her fingers, attempting to keep her emotions at bay. He knows because that's the fidget that kept him from breaking down at Mother's funeral.
He sees why she didn't listen to the Weasel. It's because she really couldn't contain emotions. It overwhelmed her, and she couldn't control it.
He breathes out. That's it.
They both have talked about their feelings. It's uncomfortable just sitting there without a clue on how to respond to each other because Draco doesn't know how to comfort another, much less the witch he bullied ruthlessly throughout their childhood. But by her lack of acknowledgment of his confession, she doesn't know how to comfort him either.
And it's all silent. The kind where you're on edge because just what is going to happen next? Who is going to speak first?
"I got in a heated argument with him inside. That's why I slammed the door and been ignoring you all night," she says quietly.
His curiosity peeked because he's never had the pleasure of seeing just how nasty the Golden Girl can get.
"What happened?"
"Told me it was all my fault. That if I continued to be the way I am, no one's going to want me. Because I'm not the golden snitch, I'm not a catch." It's a sound he fucking hates a sob that's being forced back down her throat.
"I never took him for a liar," he says simply. Because it is true, and he'd even given Weasley the benefit of the doubt, but what she had just told him shows how wrong he was. And he fucking loathes being wrong.
She gives him a look that means to continue because she doesn't trust her voice.
"Don't fucking tell me you truly believe that," he says incredulously. "You're the golden snitch. Every seekers dream. And don't you fucking forget it," he seethes because lies are disgusting.

  
    
  


  
    
  

Her eyes widen.
"And it's not your fault you don't drink your problems and feelings away," he adds. Just to top it all off. He's already walking along the edge, and he's decided that jumping is so completely worth it.
He's already summoned all the courage he can for tonight, already used it up. He can't speak again, not tonight.
But by the way her eyes are still wide and how she chews on her bottom lip, she isn't going to speak either. Because getting complimented by someone like him is like saying you're a direct descendant of Merlin. Ridiculous. Laughable. Unbelievable.
An awkward silence. That's how they spent the rest of the night.
 

  May 2, 2003

If the sniffles and shakes of her shoulders could tell a story, it'd say the one where she is still crying. But Draco doesn't know why. He can't fathom a reason that could have brought Hermione Granger to break down on Harry Potter's porch.
It was the same thing as last year except he found her by the steps when he arrived. Her nose was a light crimson, and her cheeks were splotchy. He could see the tears that stained her cheeks and the red rimming on her eyes. She'd been fidgeting with her fingers.
And when she saw him walking towards the house, she just sat there. Let him see her like that. Put her emotions on display for him, not knowing whether he'd spit in her face or wipe the tears.
But he didn't know how. He loathes showing his emotions and being comforted, so how would he know how to help someone? Showing how he feels only ever got him mocked.

  
    
  


  
    
  

So, he nodded in her direction, walked past her, went inside and got a drink, and took the place he'd declared his.
That was half an hour ago.
And she's still crying.
He tries to tune it out by listening to the muffled sounds coming from inside. Concentrate on the unsteady vibration against his back and sip on the drink that makes his throat burn.
But he can still see her. See her shoulders shake and twitch. See the way her hand moves to wipe the tears that fall down her cheeks. See the way she moves her curls away from her face.
He wants to say something to her. Something that'll make her forget about whatever it is that has brought her misery. An argument or rant he doesn't care. Anything that'll make her stop crying.
"What's wrong, Granger?"
He hears her breathe out. Sees her dismissively wave a hand at him. That's it.
He sighs.
"Granger, what's wrong," he asks again.
This time he hears a muffled sob.
"Listen, Granger, I don't know what's wrong with you, but I'll tell you this: you look and sound fucking pathetic." He twirls the umber liquid in his hand.
She goes still like she's in shock.
She's a rather petite witch. The first thought that would come to ones mind is just how kind and soft she looks. But the display in front of him fucking frightens him.
"You'd fucking know, huh," she spits with more venom than he'd ever shown her.
Bait. Draco has always thrown it out, but she's always been smarter than to take it.
"Can't even answer a question. I'd say it's simply one of the most pathetic displays I've ever had the misfortune of seeing," Draco says nonchalantly — like he isn't criticizing the witch he slightly fancies.
"Honestly, fuck off."
"Pathetic."
She laughs, but it lacks the mirth he wishes was there.
"Malfoy." She looks into his eyes. "The only reason you're invited to these parties is because Harry pities you. He pities the fact you're a pariah in the world you grew up in. You think he wants you here?" she asks. Venom's poisonous, and it stings as it hits him.
"Pathetic," he tries, hoping he masks the hurt, as well as he thinks he can.
"And you're here, for what? Need some company? You're so fucking lonely you have to come here and hang out with the people you once bullied and thought were beneath you," she barbs.

  
    
  


  
    
  

He just stands there because he didn't know she'd go to that extent. He didn't think she was aiming to kill instead of hurt. And it is killing him.

  
    
  


  
    
  

"That is fucking pathetic, Malfoy, and I'll be damned if I ever let myself go that low, so fuck off."

  
    
  


  
    
  

And it hurts. Granger's the person who made him feel some feeling that wasn't hurt. The only constant in his life — self-righteous, fair, and unproblematic Hermione Granger.
But although he feels this wave of content when she's around or when she smiles or uses that sweet, velvety voice to speak to him, he won't just let her get away without getting stung by the poison she fucking brewed and threw.
"Yet, fucking look at you," he spits. "Crying on the fucking steps like some pathetic child. Don't try and claim to be better than me when you're a fucking mirror of what I am."
She stands up so fast he barely has time to register it before she's prowling towards him. He could see the tear droplets on her cheeks when the moon shines on her honey skin.
Her face contorts into something of disgust and irritation; it's something he expected. He wanted that reaction from her, been trying to goad her out of her pitiful crying.

  
    
  


  
    
  

"Oh, don't you compare me to something as pitiful as yourself." She jabs her finger into his chest. "You're nothing, Malfoy. Nothing."

  
    
  


  
    
  

"And what makes you think you're something? Your reputation is shit after Weasley. No one wants anything to do with you." He moves closer to her. Chests touching, and he can feel her breath on his face as he sees her curls wisp away as his breath hits her. "Sounds just like me," he spits quietly.
She's so angry he could see it in the way a vein pops out of her forehead, how her eyes glass over with the frustration of him being right.
"Fuck you." And she's hitting him — pounding on his chest with all her might. He's letting her. Because he goaded her into this argument, now, he's letting her take her anger out on him.
Her brows are drawn together, and her lips are set in a line of anger. Sweat drops from her earlobe as her shoulders strain to make him hurt.
She's panting from the exertion of it all. She's slapping her fists on Draco's chest with every bit of strength she has inside of herself. Fighting against the burning sensation in her limbs, he knows is present by the way she slows down.
Her palm connects with his cheek. The force of it was so strong his face tilts to the other side. It makes his eyes sting, and he could feel the heat bloom on his cheek.
He gives her a feral look. Sneers at her, but she continues her assault on his body.
She lands a punch on his gut and makes him lose his breath. He nearly topples onto the floor. She'd used all her strength on this hit — his eyes bulge from the unexpected hit.
He places his hands on her shoulders, pushes her away from him. She's only a few feet away from him and makes her way back to him.
"You —"
He flips their positions; she's up against the wall of Potter's house. He grips her shoulders and slams her against the wall, makes her head knocks back against it, and her face contorts into one of pain. The noise it made as her body collided with the wall was a thump. Like an object was dropped from a high place.
"Don't you fucking touch me," he spits in her face.
He won't hit her. Men don't hit women; it's disgusting, but he can scare her. Make her think it and rough her up.
"You're a fucking coward," she says as she resumes her assault.
"And you're a pathetic piece of shit," he counters.
She continues hitting him. He lets her.
But when her fist connects with his jaw, he grips her wrist with a dangerous growl. He could feel his face redden by the force of her punch, and it warms and pulses at the pain.
He takes both of her wrists in his hands and puts them up by her head. He pushes them until he knows it hurts her, by the way, her eyes close for a moment.
They're both panting in each other's faces. Grange's wrists strain against his hands. Fists turn white as she struggles to escape from him. His fingers tighten around her wrists, and he brings her forward and pushes her against the wall roughly.
"Let me go. Let me fucking go," she growls at him.
"Calm the fuck down."
When she realizes he won't budge, she starts to kick him in the knees and shins. It makes new pain flourish in his body. She shakes her body in hopes of him relenting. He doesn't.
He didn't notice her knee come up until she put all her force into kneeing him in the groin, forces him to lose his breath as pain prickles all over him. It felt like a bludger hit him.
He struggles to breathe and stand up straight. He leans his weight on Granger and prevents her from moving. She continues to clamber against him, but he uses his height and weight as leverage and places his forehead on her shoulder.
"You're a fucking cunt," he says, voice strangled and lungs not filled with oxygen.
He hears her gasp. Like she's surprised he called her that. Like she doesn't fucking deserve to be called that after her little power play.
"How dare —"

  
    
  


  
    
  

"Just shut the fuck up."
"Don't ever call me —"

  
    
  


  
    
  

"And how would you fucking feel if I punched your tit right now?"
She shuts her mouth because he'd caught her off guard; she didn't know he'd retort in that way. He loves how she's at a loss for words.
She opens her mouth to say something. Closes it again because nothing comes out.
They're both breathing heavily from the struggling.
"Malfoy, get your hands off of me," she says dangerously low. He doesn't feel threatened, though. He has the advantage.
"Fuck you," he says through clenched teeth and squeezes her wrists tighter.
They're so close their noses are practically touching. Breaths collide, and chests pump against each other as they struggle to catch a breath.
There's a gleam in her eyes. Draco can't decipher it because he has never seen it before.
And between the breaths, she kisses him; connects their lips but stays unmoving, waiting for him to respond. But he's frozen. Surprised. Gobsmacked.
She'd been on the verge of popping a blood vessel. And now she's kissing Draco.
He moves his head back to look at her. Confusion etches on his face; pale blonde brows furrow, nose slightly scrunched, and his mouth ajar.
They stare into each other's eyes for a moment before she looks down. Draco could practically feel the embarrassment and regret.
She puffs a breath. "I apologize. I forgot people like me repulse you," she says quietly, shame dripping from her voice. She looks away from him, breathing heavily.
She doesn't repulse him. Not one bit. But she's been a bitch all night. Treating him like shit. He deserves it, of course. But she fucking took it too far. Getting physical with him hadn't been a part of his plan. Or at least getting kneed on the cock wasn't.
Irritation contorts his expression. Irritation with Granger's lack of thinking because her blood isn't the problem. So, he squares himself despite the prolonging pain between his thighs and sets his mind.
He transfers both her hands to his left hand and takes her chin to his right hand. He moves her eyesight to his. He could see the slight furrow in her eyebrows and the confusion in her muddy irises.
"I don't give a fuck about your blood," he tells her. He says it very slowly and ensures sure she knows.
And before she has the chance to respond, he crashes his lips onto hers. He puts all the pent-up want he has felt for her for so many years into the kiss. Kisses with fervor and desire, and passion. Dormant electricity courses through his veins. But it is no longer dormant because she lit it up. It crackles like a fire, and he loves the feel of it.
When she responds, it's equally as bruising as if she feels the same frustration as him. The aggravation and anticipation that has been piling up since the first time they saw each other after the war.
They kiss like they've been starved for years. Like they have this thirst that only each other's lips can quench. Like if they part, they won't be able to breathe. Their lungs would constrict under the duress of not being able to have each other's lips.
He lets her wrists go, and they immediately find his hair — buries her hands and tugs his head further towards her.
He licks her bottom lip awaiting entrance. When their tongues meet, they both groan. The sensation of her tongue sliding against his feels heavenly. It feels like the universe finally let him have something. Let him have something good, something that makes him content.
His hand slithers towards her chestnut mane. He wraps those curls around his fist like he always dreamed of and tugs her head upwards to deepen the kiss. A small moan that sounds involuntary escapes her throat. He swallows it and feels the vibrations of it against his tongue.
His other hand rests on her hip but slowly slithers upwards to her waist. His grip tightens, and he pushes her further into the wall.
Her fingers play and tug his hair, and it leaves him with goose flesh and a want for more; feel her on him. Feel her skin on his.

  
    
  


  
    
  

Their lips move in unison like they've done all of this before.
He feels her hunger by the way she devours his lips. Insistent. Persistent. Eager.
She nips his bottom lip, which elicits a groan from deep in his throat. He could taste the copper of his blood, and she sucks on his lip. The action in itself makes him moan. It is hot.

  
    
  


  
    
  

He wedges his knee in between her thighs and locks her into place. He lifts his knee to slightly rub against her cunt. It's enough to make her moan. He could feel the warmth of her.
"You like that?" he says roughly against her lips, grinds his knee with more pressure than he'd done the first time.
She groans against his lips. He takes it as a 'yes'.
Their lips never stop moving, and she slowly begins to grind on his thigh in her volition.
Their kisses get rougher and more urgent. And Granger moves like she's in heat.
They're both in need of each other.
As she continues grinding against his thigh, she groans and moans into his mouth. He feels each vibration through his throat. It feels amazing. He wants to get high with the feeling.
She pulls back, panting, and he takes that as an invitation to her neck and begins placing open-mouthed kisses along her throat. His grip on her hair hasn't relented, only increased to tilt her head back.
He nips her pulse point and sucks so fervently the skin might break. But it feels so good. He knows by the strangled moans she gives him and the tightening of her hand in his locks.
He smirks because he has found the spot. The one that takes her breath away. The one that makes her make those pretty noises for him.

  
    
  


  
    
  

He licks a stripe along her jaw with his tongue. Then goes back with open-mouthed kisses.
He feels her grip tighten and drag his lips back to hers. Their lips massage each other. It feels the way he thinks a dementor's kiss would feel. Except for the opposite because instead of her sucking his euphoria, she's filling him with it.
He feels her grind especially hard on his knee. So hard it makes her separate her lips from his and moan against his lips, such a beautiful noise.
She begins to slowly unbutton his shirt. He wants to let her continue, wishes to feel her hands roam around his body, feel her nails mark his back. But he can't. Not tonight.
He can taste the alcohol on her tongue. Whether it had been just a glass or several, he rather her be sober. Because then she wouldn't be able to regret what they could do in the future. She wouldn't be able to blame it on the alcohol she consumed.
He detangles his fingers from her curls and gently places his hand on the side of her head. He softens the kiss. Forces it to be more soft than hungry.
He brings his other hand to her cheek. Places softly as the kiss progressively get softer. But she's still slowly unbuttoning his shirt, and it pains him to have to stop when he has gotten this far. He doesn't know whether he will have this chance again.
He breaks the kiss and stops her hands from going any lower. Their faces are so close, and he can feel her panting.
"Not tonight," he whispers.
Her chestnut brows furrow as she tries to reach his jaw. They stare into each other's eyes.
He places a chaste kiss against her lips, to which she responds with everything she has. His thumb strokes her cheek, and he begins to back away from her.
He turns and begins to amble towards the apparition point. It's a slow and relaxed sort of walk. The kind only Hermione Granger can make him do.
He doesn't turn back to see her or whether there is regret or want painted on her features. He doesn't look to see whether she's still panting for breath or sitting down on the steps trying to collect her thoughts. He doesn't know any of it, but he still walks to the apparition point and goes home.
 

  May 2, 2004

They're both sitting on the steps tonight. There has been no talking or direct eye contact, a simple nod of acknowledgment, and the tension that grew as she got closer to the steps.
He did the usual routine: go inside, make his presence known, get a glass of fire whiskey, and go back outside.
He noticed she wasn't there yet, which was odd because usually, she'd be sitting on the chaise with white knuckles clutching a wine glass. They'd make eye contact, and it was always something new that happened outside by the steps.
He hadn't thought much of it, practically forced himself not to. So, he leaned his back against his spot and waited. But while he waited, he felt the urge to sit on the steps. Some could call it waiting for her, but he is not some. His feet had just begun to hurt, and the only logical thing to do was to sit.
So, he sat there sipping his drink, loving the burning sensation it left as it traveled through his mouth and down his throat.
He saw her stride towards the direction of the house. Felt his face turn hot, and he could just tell his face was coloring into a light shade of crimson. But he kept himself composed and gave her the yearly nod. She'd given him an odd look and returned the nod.
She walked onto the steps and sat beside him, just the proper distance. She didn't go inside or make her presence known, didn't get a glass of wine, or do anything but sit by him.
They've sat in awkward silence for half an hour, but it feels like it has been two.
Moments like this make him miss the vibrations that he would feel leaning on the wall. Miss the satisfying taps of his foot.
She's biting her nails. Draco notices when he looks to his left. She seems to be deep in her thoughts.
She doesn't notice his staring, so he takes advantage of it. Her chestnut curls are in a lazy knot with smaller curls hanging by the sides. The light of the moon made her complexion look creamy and honey-looking. He could see the light scarlet the cold makes on her nose. She sees the beginning of red splotches on her cheeks, the way her arm rests on her knee while she balances her head on her other arm, sees the way her eyes flit in all directions, and stares at those pink lips he longs to kiss again and longs to nip and suck on.
He looks at her, but it only makes him realize that he probably will never get to have her. Never get to love her. Never get to show her just how sorry he is. Never get to treat her the way she deserves.
But then he remembers just how unworthy he is of it all. He doesn't deserve to be able to do all those things.
She puffs a breath. "It's rude to stare, you know."
He feels his ears begin to warm, and he knows they're turning scarlet again. It's so fucking embarrassing.
He clears his throat and directs his gaze onto the trees that barely have leaves on the branches.
She hadn't even been looking in his direction, so how could she have seen him? She seems so concentrated on whatever it was she was staring at, so he didn't count her periphery. Dumb of him.
He doesn't say anything — can't fathom a reply. Not when he has been caught. It just stays silent, and the tension only increases as time passes by.
"Why didn't you fuck me last year," she asks suddenly. Nonchalance sprinkled all over her tone like the question hadn't been stated so vulgarly. Like she wasn't asking Draco the question.

  
    
  


  
    
  

He practically chokes on the sip of whiskey he'd been swallowing to ease his nerves. He coughs and hacks dramatically to give himself some time to think of an answer. Time to accept that she indeed wanted him to fuck her last year.
But the fact that she still thought about it all this time surprises him. They hadn't seen each other in all that time, and she still thinks about that night. The night she made him the happiest he'd been in a long time.
He can feel her stare burning holes in the side of his head from the intensity of it all.
"I tasted the alcohol in your mouth," he says, purposely not mentioning the altercation they'd gotten in. His voice wasn't weak but more strained.
He can see as the confusion etches on her features in his periphery.
"What does that have to do with anything?" she asks, puzzlement and disbelief evident in her voice. She has moved her body towards Draco, but he maintains his facing forward.
"You would've regretted it and would've blamed it on the alcohol. I'd rather you know that you wanted it and have you face that fact I fucked you. That it was me who made you feel all those things," Draco responds vehemently.

  
    
      
    
  


  
    
      
    
  

A noise he can't describe if his life depended on it. A mix between a whine, moan, and confusion came from those lips. It made his blush deepen.
"No, I wouldn't have," she scoffs at his assumption. "If my memory serves me right, I sought you out, didn't I?"
He breathes out. "Could've been the alcohol."
She doesn't know all the things he'd do to be able to repeat last year and have more than last year.

  
    
  


  
    
  

"It wasn't," she says intensely. Like she's trying to prove something.
"I guess we'll never find out then, hm," he says, attempting his best to make it sound nonchalant, although as the words left his mouth, it left a bitter taste on his tongue.
She has moved closer now he hadn't noticed. She takes his chin in her petite hand and shifts his face towards hers; muddy irises meet mercury ones. Their faces are so close that their noses nearly touch. He could feel her breaths against his face.
"And why is that?" she asks quietly. Her gaze is so intense Draco feels like she's staring into his soul. The soul that could be hers with just a simple, please.

  
    
  


  
    
  

His mind goes blank, can't form a coherent thought besides just how beautiful she looks so close. How lovely it is to be able to study her so closely.
"I doubt you'd want to tonight," he breathes.
She smirks. "Always so wrong, aren't you?"
She connects their lips before he could form a response or make an expression. He melts into the kiss he's been thinking of since last year. It's like a fire that has been dying has suddenly turned into an inferno.
Her hand travels to his cheek while his makes its way to her ribs, fingers splay and pull her closer to him. His other hand goes for her lower back, puts just the slightest pressure in hopes that she'll come closer.
Their lips dance together. Granger mirrors the desire he has been feeling since the year before in the way she kisses him so intensely and passionately.
He nips her bottom lip and slides his tongue along it. Licks the blood from the broken skin, which seems to spur her on; she connects their lips so quickly and roughly that their teeth clink together.
She doesn't ask or signal for it. Practically pries Dracos lips open and meets his tongue with hers. He doesn't complain, though, because he likes it. He groans when he feels it graze his.
She cups his face and lifts herself onto her knees, which forces him to tilt his head upwards to meet her. She runs her hand through his pale locks and tugs at it, deepening the kiss, which elicits a groan from each of them.
The hand on her ribs moves to her thigh, and he grips it like if he were to let go, he'd be taken from her. Like he'd never be able to touch her again. He carefully guides her leg over his lap, so she straddles him. He slithers his hand from her thigh to up her spine, splays his fingers on the nape of her neck — gently squeezes.
"Granger..."
She moves her torso closer to him. So close she grinds on his cock. She bites his lip as if to hold in a moan. Bites so hard she breaks the skin but soothes the stinging with a lap of her tongue and then sucks. He groans low and dangerously.
He separates their lips to catch his breath, and she takes that as an invitation to assault his neck. She places open-mouthed kisses but abandons that and begins to suck on his skin.
She pulls his bottom lip between her teeth and looks into his eyes and says, "Please."
Her grip on his hair tightens as she tilts his head upwards. She kisses her way up his throat and gently sucks on his adam's apple, which elicits an involuntary whimper to escape his throat.
She rocks her hips into his roughly. It's like his reaction to her spurs her on. Like she gets off to the noises he makes as he gets off to the ones she gives him.
Both of his hands move to her hips. His grip on them is sure to leave bruises, but he can't find it in himself to care. His hands slowly guide her hips. Each rock of their hips makes his breath hitch and makes her suck harder on his neck.
She finds this spot just below his ear and sucks. It's like his body freezes, and the only thing he can feel is her hot lips sucking. It feels like his fucking soul is leaving his body.
He whimpers when she stops. And maybe she has had just about enough because she rips open his shirt. Buttons go flying, and the clatter sounds of it.
She begins to kiss down his chest, but before she can touch any more skin with her lips, he tangles his hand in curls and pulls her face towards his. Their faces are so close, but they aren't touching. They're both panting in each other's faces.
"I'm giving you an out right now," he pants. Granger's fingers tighten in his hair, and confusion etches in her face. She tries to rock into his hips, and he has to forcefully stop her.
"N-no," she stutters, panting like she's run a marathon. She tries to grind on Draco again, but his grip stops her, much to his irritation.
"I'll ruin you, Golden Girl." She stares into his silver irises, breaths coming in almost evenly. He searches her face for a reaction or sign that she might want to stop.
Gods, he doesn't want to stop. He wants to get lost in her and feel her body on his. To taste her and to hear all the different types of noises she'll make for him.
He will ruin her, he knows, but he fucking hopes she ruins him. Make it impossible for him to ever be with another witch. It's too early but fuck if it's not the way he feels.
"Promise?" she asks as her grin widens. She yanks his shirt off his shoulder — it rests on his elbows. Her hands roam around his toned chest and shoulders, feeling his porcelain skin. They don't mind each others scars.
She knows what she's doing and how much she affects him. Knows she has the power to make him jelly in her hands and how he will do anything to please her. She has to fucking know.
He secures her legs around his waist and begins to lift off of steps. She sees him start to get up and clings onto his shoulders.
"Hold on. We aren't doing this on the steps of Potter's fucking porch," he says as he begins to walk them towards the apparition point. And he hears her giggle as she presses kisses on the juncture between his neck and shoulder.
She's insatiable. She would probably have fucked Draco into Potter's porch hadn't he stopped them. He doesn't know why but he loves that she mirrors his feelings.
It's not long before they're in his flat. He has Granger against his door, not phased by the intensity of the apparition. Wrists pinned up by her head and her legs wrapped around his waist as he grinds into her while their lips work in unison. Manic like it's the last time their lips will ever meet. Strangled moans leave her lips and enter his mouth.
He doesn't know where his button-up went. Maybe it got lost during their apparition, or it's on the floor somewhere forgotten. He doesn't care at all. All he cares about is the witch in his arms.
Her head is thrown back against the door, and she's panting up to the gods. He nips and sucks at the honey skin on her neck. Her thighs squeeze around his waist pulls him closer. She tries to touch him, but his grip keeps her arms up.
She brings her head down, which gives him less access to her neck. He pins both of her hands above her head with just one of his. He takes her chin in his hand. They look into each other's eyes, and he can see her dilated pupils. Maybe he looks the same.
He begins moving her head to expose her neck, but she stills her head.
"Malfoy," she pants quietly. "Fuck me already, will you?" A wolfish smirk graces his features.
"Patience, Granger."
He lets go of her wrists and places his hands on her arse, gives it a good squeeze which makes her breathlessly laugh. And he begins walking towards his bedroom.
When he passes his chaise, she separates their lips and gives him an odd look.
"Where are you going?" she asks.
"The bedroom," he says as he places a kiss on her chest.
"We'll have time for that later. Malfoy, just fuck me into your chaise," she practically whines. "I just want you to fuck me," she says against his lip, connects their lips, and kisses him sensually.
He makes his way towards the chaise and sits. She straddles his hips. They kiss fervently, and his heart begins to race because he finally gets to have the witch he has wanted for years.
Her hands are on his chest, and his are on her back. He grips her blouse and rips the material. It sounds like the ripping of parchment aggressively. She gasps into his mouth, and he takes that as an opportunity and grazes his tongue on her. He takes her tongue into his lips and sucks on it, makes her eyes roll back, fingers tighten in his locks.
She begins to kiss down his neck. Lightly grazes the pad of her thumb against the juncture of his shoulder and neck. She places a trail of kisses along his collar bone and chest, grazes her tongue along with his nipple, fucking loves having her warm tongue on him, might be his favorite feeling in the world.
He releases a strangled breath when her teeth graze his nipple, and he could feel the smirk on her lips, but he's so lost in the feeling of her he can't care.
Each kiss she places on his skin leaves a searing sensation in its wake. It arouses him more than it should. More than it has with any of the other witches he has been with.
She trails kisses until she reaches his sternum and begins to climb off his lap, and fiddles with the straps of her bra. Slowly takes a strap off her shoulder, and there's a danger to the smirk on her face. And it thrills him. She pulls the other strap and takes off the bra.
He drinks her, saviors it like she's the last glass of pumpkin juice he has beat everyone to. She bites her lip. A pinch of nerves is sprinkled onto her confidence. There's a slight flush on her chest.
He has never seen such a perfect pair; they're not small or large. They're just the ideal size with brown nipples. He wants to lick them, bite them, mark them, tease them.
He takes her in; round against the curve of her breasts and the subtle curves of her waist. Her trousers are still in place, but he knows they won't be in just a few.
"Fucking perfect," he says to himself. "Gorgeous." She hears by the look of it, and a light blush floods her cheeks. It's cute.
She bends down just a bit and spreads his legs, drops on her knees right in front of him, and starts to undo his belt as she looks up at him with a wicked grin on her face and her tongue sliding against her lips.
His eyes widen as he realizes what she's about to do. He can't fathom that he's got the Golden Girl on her knees for him. His heart thumps rapidly against his chest as she starts to unzip his trousers. And he could see how quick and precise her fingers move.

  
    
  


  
    
  

"Granger... you don't —"
He's cut off by just how quick she is to lower his trousers and take him out. She'd begun to stroke him when he had been about to tell her it wasn't necessary.
"Plan on finishing that sentence of yours?" she teasingly asks as she strokes his cocks slowly, fist tight and wrist-twisting, making sensations of pleasure course all through his body.
A strangled breathe escapes his lips when her thumb lightly strokes the tip. His body goes still, and it's hard to take in a full breath. It all just feels so good.
She's watching him. Carefully seeing his reactions and noting what he responds to and doesn't. She has this satisfied smirk plastered on her face.
Her pumps slow even more until she stops. She begins to lower her head as if to take his cock in her mouth. And he couldn't wish for a better view or better situation to be in but —
"I — I've never — no one has —" he stutters as her lips nearly wrap around the tip.
Her face stays so close to his cock. Eyes flit to meet his, and a knowing smile graces her face.
His face flames as she stares at him.
"No one has ever sucked you off?" Her eyes gleam with satisfaction. "Hmm, I think I like that," she says slowly.
She sucks on his tip, sending sparks throughout his body, traces a particularly thick vein all along with his cock but keeps her eyes focused on just how much he's enjoying her ministrations.
She takes him in her mouth. Gradually lowers, teases him because she just knows how good her hot mouth and wet tongue feel, knows that he's never felt such delicious pleasure before.
She takes him all, every inch.
He can feel her throat contracting around him, which makes it hard to get in a full breath.
She slowly begins to bob her head.
Her curls fall forward, so he decides to wrap them around his fist so a better view of his cock in her mouth. He's able to see her lips wrapped around his cock and her cheeks hollow out when she sucks and makes his legs shake.
He sighs. "Just... just like that," he moans. "Don't stop. Please."
He feels the smirk on her lips.
His grip on her hair only tightens. But he never pushes her down. It seems like a distasteful thing to do when she's doing so well on her own.
His breathing has become ragged.
Her tongue flicks his tip, and the strain on her scalp doesn't relent. He could feel her tongue on the underside of his cock. The slick and warmth of it.
He didn't notice her hand come up until he felt her cup his balls. She lightly massages them, and his head falls on the back of the chaise. His favorite chaise now.
Her hands are warm and soft, like how he imagines a cloud would feel. She works it with skill and precision. And the groan that leaves his mouth. He's sure his neighbors heard it.
Good. All of them should know just how well the Golden Girl is sucking his cock.
All the sensations he feels only add up to the growing tension in his lower stomach. It's a tight twist that he's trying to hold in. Trying to savor the feeling of Granger's lips wrapped around him, but it just feels so good.
He can feel it in the way his legs begin to shake uncontrollably and the way his heart thumps painfully in his chest.
But he doesn't want to finish in her mouth. It sounds like a lovely idea. Truly. But he plans on finishing somewhere else. Somewhere far more pleasant.
He pulls her by her curls and drags her off her knees. He brings her towards his mouth and crashes their lips together. Kisses her intensely, and he can taste the slight bit of precum that is on her tongue. But he doesn't mind, not one bit.
She moves to straddle his lap and runs her hands on every patch of skin she can find.
He grabs her waist and lays her on the chaise, goes between her legs, and looms over her. Her curls splay all over the pillow, and it reminds him of a lion's mane.
He lowers his head and licks a line between her breasts. Peppers kisses all over her chest then tease the skin close to the left nipple. It's pebbled, but he thinks she should be teased just a bit more.
Her breathing is rapid; the anticipation is getting to her. Like she doesn't know when Draco's lips will touch where she wants them. She doesn't know whether he'll make her wait.
He won't, not tonight. Because he has wanted and needed this for so long; he won't deny the both of them. Not when they mirror each other's feelings.
He lightly grazes his tongue on his nipple. Hears Granger's breath hitch. It's like even the slightest touch will make her react to him.
He breathlessly laughs. "Has no one ever paid attention to these glorious tits of yours?" He peppers kiss on them as he awaits her response.
"Not many men are as considerate," she says as she wraps a lock of his hair around her finger. Her breathing is a bit labored, but she speaks as if it isn't.
He cocks a pale brow. "Then, they aren't men, are they? Men care about the lady's pleasure before their own. You have only ever been with boys."

  
    
  


  
    
  

He closes his mouth and sucks on her nipple. Her back arches, a hand comes behind his head and tangles in his hair as a beautiful moan leaves her lips.
He leaves marks all over her left breast. Whether it be with a suck or a bite, she enjoys it, encourages him.
He kneads the right breast as he licks and sucks on the left. It fits perfectly in his palm — so soft, and the ways it makes Granger's body convulse spurs him on. It feels like she will rip out his hair with the grip she has on it. He likes it, welcomes it.
He moves his mouth to the right breast, and on the inner part of it, he bites it. It's not very hard, but it does leave a mark. And he can hear her whimper in pain. He runs his tongue along it to soothe the stinging, then closes his lips around it and sucks. It causes her to release a sigh.
He laves at her breasts until she's begging him, tugging at his hair until he feels like she's going to rip it off, and lifting her hips to attempt to somewhat grind against him.
He lifts his head from her chest to look at her. Her face is one of pure ecstasy, tears streaming down her temples as she says, "Gods, Malfoy, you're such a tease," in a strangled voice.
"My mission." A wolfish grin splits his lips.
He begins to pepper kisses down her torso until he gets to her trouser buttons, looks into her chestnut irises as he slowly undoes the buttons. Her chest rises up and down quickly, and her arms are at her sides, waiting for his next move.
The anticipation is killing her, he knows. He uses the zipper as a way to heighten the growing anticipation, undoes it slowly, and slides his tongue along his bottom lip, a mischievous smirk painted on his lips.
He hooks his fingers onto the waistband of her trousers and knickers, begins to pull them down but has a hard time because she's lying on them.
He's a bit more confident than he was when they first started this. He only says it to keep Granger needy for him. Only says it to experiment whether it's a kink of hers.
"Why don't you be a good girl and lift your hips for me?" he asks, voice a very low timbre, dangerous if anyone who wasn't them heard it. Confident smirk plastered on his features.
Her eyes widen, and even though the lights are out, he can see her face turn a darker shade of crimson. He just fucking loves that he caused that reaction with just a few words.

  
    
  


  
    
  

She scrambles to lift her hips and helps him slip off her trousers and knickers, slides them hastily but fluidly. And he can't help but laugh at her eagerness.
She's bare before him. Before him.

  
    
  


  
    
  

Her chest rises and falls rapidly. Hands dig into the cushions of the chaise, waiting for his next move. Eyes wide and glossy. Her legs are parted, and he's between them.
He avoids looking at her most vulnerable place despite her willingness, doesn't feel like it could be true.
If he looked at her there, it would change everything. The woman he bullied and hated has permitted him to touch her, permitted him to see her bare. But looking at her is difficult because he knows he doesn't deserve to see her so vulnerably and beautifully. He shouldn't get to do this.
He lowers his eyes to his hands.
"Listen, uh, if you don't want to it's totally fine," her voice cracks as she speaks. It's unsteady and not at all like Hermione Granger.
His eyes shoot to look into hers.
"No! I — I do," he says quietly but desperately.
He leans into her, places his hands on either side of her ribs.
"Then, why won't you look at me? You... you look like you've seen something horrible." She gulps. "Don't feel like you have to just because I'm naked in front of you."
He places his forehead onto her chest, takes in a trembling breath.
"No, I do. I want to," Draco murmurs against her skin, places a soft kiss between her breasts.
"Then, what is the problem?"
He breathes out. Short and remorseful.
"You — you shouldn't want this. Not with me," Draco says as his fingers rub tiny circles on her ribs. "I don't deserve this."
"I want what I want. It is my choice, Malfoy." She rubs her foot against his thighs reassuringly. "Look at me."
He doesn't, only squeezes his eyes shut.
"I'll taint you."
"Do it."
"Your friends will hate you."
"I don't care."
She cups his face and brings him a hair length away. "Stop overthinking," she whispers. She places a chaste kiss on his lips. "Look at all of me." A kiss. "You deserve this." Another kiss. "Please."
They look into each others eyes, a small smile on her lips.
He begins to kiss down her throat, between her breasts, and down her belly. He kisses a line across her lower stomach.
He lifts himself and looks at her, then looks at her cunt. There's a thatch of chestnut curls, sees her glisten from her arousal. It makes his cock twitch. Because it was him who caused that.
He lowers his head and begins to kiss the inside of her thigh, leaves open-mouthed kisses. Leaves bite marks in his wake and eventually reaches her mound.
He glides his tongue along her slit, hears her gasp and her legs twitch. She tastes fucking delicious.
She tangles his hair in her fingers and pulls him up to her.
"We have time for that later." She kisses him deeply.
"I want more," he says against her lips. It was only a tiny taste, but fuck, he wants more.
"Later. We have time for that later," Granger breathes out.
She crashes their lips together. Tongues dancing together as she slowly begins to rise. Draco gets on his knees, and she meets him on her knees too.
His hands travel to space between her shoulders. Both index fingers line up parallel to each other. Slowly glides them down, passes her back dimples, grazes her arse cheeks, and stays on the backs of her thighs. Fingers grip her thighs and begin to pull them closer to him as he leans backward until she is on top of him.
Her curls surround the both of them as she lowers herself in to kiss him. He brings his hands up to the sides of her head.
She leans backward and places herself in between his legs, places her hands on the waistline of his trousers, and begins to pull them off. He lifts his hips to help her remove them faster.
She places her knees on either side of his hips and takes his cock into her palm, strokes him a few times before aligning their centers.
He holds his breath.
She teases his tip along with her opening, a smirk on her lips as her eyes study him. He releases a hiss between his teeth.
He places his hands on her hips and sheathes her. A groan escapes his lips. Eyes wide as he watches her with parted lips. Her forehead creases as a wince leave her lips.
She is warm and slick for him.
She rocks her hips into his, slowly. She gets the feel of him as he enjoys the slow torture. He watches her hips move and curls swing.
He uses his grip on her hips to quicken her pace. Her eyes flutter as she lets go of a breathy moan.
She moves with his hands. Hands on his chest, fingers biting his skin, nearly breaks the skin. It's a pain he wants more of. It's delicious in that way.
"Just like that. Ride me until your hips hurt, and your thighs burn," Draco growls.
It feels like his blood is boiling. Scorching underneath his skin like the Cruciatus Curse was thrown at him. Electrifying his nerves and making him sweat. Heart pounding and panting.
It's a bittersweet pain, the squeeze of her as she clenches him. Just how tight she was when he first got inside of her feels like a glass of ice-cold water on a scorching day.
He moves his hands to her arse cheeks, grips them tightly in his palms. He knows it'll leave a bruise tomorrow. Maybe she'll let him study them for a couple of hours in the morning.
He releases a sigh at the thought. Smile on his lips as Granger continues to ride him like a fucking goddess. "Gods, you feel so fucking good," he says as he watches her.
Sweat glistens on her neck, and there's a faint blush on her cheeks from the exertion. Stray curls stick to her neck and temples.
He massages her arse cheeks vigorously, elicits a moan followed by a breathy laugh.
He lifts himself from his laying position, begins planting kisses on her chest and neck, laving at the sweat. A hand at her lower back guides her, another hand on the space between her shoulders — presses her into his face, so he could get more of her into his mouth.
"Ruined," he says against her neck.
He puts pressure on her lower back as he fucks up into her. Her nails dig into his shoulders as a long and guttural moan leaves her throat. Her head is thrown back with her eyes closed.
"J-just like that. Mhm, don't stop," Granger says against his fringe. Breaths moving his locks like it would on a windy day.
His breaths are harsh against her chest. Hands frigid as he clings to her body. Core muscles burn as he lifts his hips to meet hers.
He wraps her curls around his fist. Her head is thrown back as she screams for him, pushes her forehead against his. Feels her breaths collide with his. Both of their lips ajar as gasps and groans leave their throats.
The chaise creaks as it moves across the floor. Moves with the rock of their hips.
She tilts his head up and smashes their lips together. Teeth clink, and breaths are shared in each others mouths.
He slides his tongue against hers. He places his hands on the sides of Granger's head as he groans into her mouth. Her tongue finds the roof of his mouth as he strains his hips and thighs. She sucks on his bottom lip and nips it.
It's more of a sloppy kiss. Lazy and dirty. And if anyone saw it from a perspective that wasn't theirs, they'd think it distasteful. But they wouldn't know how good it feels, how it makes Draco's blood thrum and hum in satisfaction and pleasure.
He leans more in, hovers over her, and lowers himself so close their noses graze each other. Her legs wrap around his waist, and he sinks in deeper. His eyes roll back, and he groans against the skin of her neck. She tightens her legs and stretches her neck out as her lips shape into an "o" shape in silent pleasure.
"So beautiful. Perfect. Doing so good," Draco mumbles against her neck.
He places open-mouthed kisses along the column of her throat.
He pistons into her. A pace so quick he can't think. There's a burning sensation on his thighs and the strain of his hips.
The slaps of sweaty skin, creaks of the chaise, and their groans and moans fill the air around them. It's the only thing they can hear. The only noise Draco ever wants to hear.
His pace doesn't falter. And as he sucks on Granger's right nipple with fervor, he feels her flutter around him. He drops his head onto her chest as he chokes on a moan. He can't fathom she's about to cum on his cock.
He sucks on her pulse point — she thrashes against him, clings onto his body for support.
"I-I'm about... gonna come," she stutters mindlessly.
He ceases his movements, stops kissing her neck, stops moving inside of her, stops everything.
She whines against his lips, "No, please. Don't stop. Gods, don't do this to me."
Pride engulfs him as he registers her words, such glorious words. Because hearing her beg for him inflates his ego a little more than it should.
He scoops her back with his arm and twists her around. He puts her on all fours and enters her again, continues his punishing pace. He hits the places he couldn't in the position before.
His hands are on her hips, and the skin of her arse cheeks slaps his hips. The moonlight makes the sweat on her back and his torso glisten.
His head is thrown back, eyes closed as he relishes the feeling of being so deep inside of her. He slides his tongue on his lips and tightens his grip on her.
She meets his thrusts enthusiastically. Pretty noises dripping from her mouth as her hands dig into the material of the chaise.
"Don't stop. Never stop," Granger repeats like a mantra.
He quickens his pace. Her words do something to him, affect him. He has never moved this fast. Never fucked someone so hard his thighs began to shake and burn.
Her curls stick to her back. Looks so beautiful with her honey skin. Looks fucking mesmerizing as it sways to the rhythm of Draco's thrusts.
She begins to flutter around him again.
She releases a long, guttural moan. "Right there... there!"
He carefully teases the collection of nerves she so badly wants him to hit, hits everywhere minus there. And she whines in frustration.
He runs his fingers lightly over her spine, loves to feel her arch under his touch, feels the sweaty and sticky skin of her back.
He lowers his face onto her back, continues to fuck her as he does so, places a chaste kiss on her lower back. He starts at her lower hips and licks a stripe across her back to her neck.
He loops his left arm around her middle and lifts her, places her back to his front. The slap of the skin was loud, but it didn't overpower the groans of the chaise and her thunderous cries.
He pounds into the spot she's begging him to, going in as hard as he can. Making sure she feels the delicious ripples of pleasure course through her body as it does his.
He moves her curls to her left shoulder, begins to nip and suck at her neck. He wraps his fingers around her throat as he whispers dirty things into her ear.

  Such a good girl.


  So perfect.


  Take me so well.


  Look at you.


  Look so beautiful taking my cock.


  You sound like an angel.


  So needy for me.


  Clench around me one more time.


  Just like that.


  Do you like it when I whisper to you? Tell you how perfect and angelic you are?


  So good for me.


  I want you to remember who's making you feel like this.


  Let everyone hear just how good you're getting fucked right now. By who you're getting fucked by.


  Scream my fucking name like it's the only way to save your life.


  Yeah?


  Beg me, princess.

And she does scream his name until it makes her throat raw. Until he's certain it hurts. Until he hears it crack from the strain of her voice. Until he feels the vibrations against her throat cease from the stinging.

  Draco — Draco... so good.


  I'll be a good girl for you.


  Draco!


  Oh, please don't stop.


  Don't — don't, oh fuck.


  Just for you.


  Gods, it's all for you.


  Y-yes.


  Please, please.

It caught him by surprise that she used his given name, expected her to have ignored his request. But it sent thrills through his veins when she'd said it. And he is more than delighted in hearing her utter his name again with her sweet voice.
He licks the shell of her ear, sucks it into his mouth. Her hands come to his thighs, grounds herself, and digs her nails into them. He hisses at the sting but doesn't want to feel anything but it.
"You like that?" he breathes against her ear. Wisps of her hair move as his breaths hit them.
She makes a choking noise, slightly nods her head against his shoulder. Chest moving up and down rapidly, unable to catch her breath as he fucks her mercilessly.
"Use your words, Granger," he commanded, voice rough as he attempts to mask the bliss he's in.
"Y-yeah. I love it. Please... don't stop," she breathlessly begs.
He chuckles low in his throat. Raw and involuntary and genuine.
"Filthy, filthy girl."
She sobs in agreement because she can barely form words. Her mind is just a mess of incoherent thoughts.
His right-hand goes up to her right breast. He rubs the pad of his thumb against the nipple until it pebbles, pinches, and twists it. It makes her back arch, makes her drop her head against his left shoulder.
He kneads her breast whilst thrusting into her with all his might, trails his fingers lightly across her torso until he reaches her mound. Finds her clit and rubs slow circles on it as she flutters around him again.
He pinches her clit as, "Come for me like the good girl I know you are," leaves his lips. She gasps, and he feels her grip him like a vice as she cums around his cock. She releases a loud cry. Her nails break the skin of his thighs, and her back arches against him. Head thrown over his shoulders, and he sees her face contort as her orgasm overtakes her. Looks so beautiful — eyes clenched tight, mouth ajar with screams dripping from it, forehead creased in concentration of the sensations she's feeling.
He pumps in a few more times before he stills and groans into the crook of her neck, bites down as hard as he can, and breaks the skin. He tastes the blood on his tongue. Metallic. And she hisses through her teeth.
He buries his face in her curls and drops onto her. She lays on her stomach, and he lays on her back. Both are panting like they've just dueled for hours on end.
Her hand comes up to her face, wipes at the sweat on her temples, leaves it by her head. He places his by hers, and she interlocks their fingers lazily.
He kisses her shoulder sluggishly. Still inside of her as he softens. His heart still pounds in his ears with the exhilaration of it all.
"Didn't think you'd have it in you, Malfoy," she says when she'd been able to catch her breath.
He breathlessly laughs. "How so?"
"You kept your promise," she replies.
He feels a wave of pride wash over him. The things Granger says — she doesn't know how greatly they affect him.
He places a finger under her chin, guides her face towards his, and kisses her — slow and sensually. When they separate, they grin at each other.
They spend the rest of the night between resting and fucking. He’d fucked her on almost every surface in his flat.
  
    Chapter Text
    
  November 12, 2004

  He’ll never understand just why she’d fancy a read over him. Truly. 

  A romance book of all fucking books. 

  What attracts her to those kinds of books? The pretty things the guy says to their girl? The sex? Or is it the passionate love written in the pages most want to be a reality for them?

  Maybe he’d read a few books in the past. 

  Whether the book is exciting or not, he wants her attention. Kisses and just anything she’d give him is preferable. 

  To feel her admiration is the part of his day he always looks forward to. And today, that part hasn’t come. Because she’s reading a fucking book when he could say and do much better than the characters in those flimsy pages. 

  He could say things that’ll leave her speechless, kiss her and leave her stomach fluttering and utterly breathless, make her feel his intense feelings that’ll just leave her with a whole heart. 

  But interrupting Hermione Granger while she reads is like entering a lion’s den with a lion that hasn’t eaten in days. 

  Deadly. 

  No, it isn’t an exaggeration. 

  He’d nearly died the first time he’d taken a book from her fingers. 

  She refused to cuddle with him or kiss him the entire day. 

  Hell is the only word to describe that day. 

  But fuck if he doesn’t need her right now. 

  And so he thinks, thinks until an idea pops into his head. An idea that can solve his fucking dilemma. 

  Minutes pass. 

  
    Fuck. 
  

  More. 

  
    Shit. 
  

  Minutes or hours?

  
    Uhg. 
  

  How long has it been?

  
    She looks beautiful. 
  

  She can’t possibly read for this long.

  
    I just want to rip that fucking book out of her hands and bury my face in her neck. 
  

  Time. Time. Time. 

  
    Her eyes have flecks of sweet honey in them. 
  

  That’s when it hits him. 

  He heads over to the kitchen, grabs a bag of her favorite crisps. 

  They’re this muggle brand called 
  
    Doritos
  
  . It’s an odd name if you asked him, but he’d be damned if they weren’t the tastiest thing in the world. 

  He makes his way towards the couch she lays in. It’d be a lie if he said he wasn’t nervous. It’s ridiculous, really, and as much as he adores her, he is bloody scared of her. 

  Her hair is in a knot; it’s a proper mess. She wears his old quidditch jersey. It practically swallows her and fuck if she isn’t prettiest girl he has ever seen. 

  She has her lips between her teeth, enchanted by the letters that are love. Her brows are drawn together, probably at odds with what’s going on in the book. 

  He gets to the far end of the couch, stands in front of her, looking down as he gathers himself. 

  Gods, he hopes this works. 

  He wraps his fingers around her ankles, parts her thighs, crisps still in hand as he does so. Maybe it’s his lucky day because when his eyes met his favorite place, he’d seen nothing but emerald knickers. 

  Bloody hell. 

  He attempts to hide his grin. 

  Fucking cunt-eating grin. 

  And she’s watching him now. The novel is still in her hands but her eyes are on his. Chocolate irises bore into mercury ones and he forgets about his nerves for a moment, only focusing on the beauty he has been blessed with. 

  He can see her smirk despite the book covering her pretty lips. Her eyes say it all and it’s a relief she isn’t upset he’d interrupted her. 

  She isn’t shy at all, he’d expected her to close her legs or object to whatever he was planning. He should’ve known better than to think her smirk was anything but mischievous. 

  She’d spread her legs wider, showing off her knickers. The knickers he’s practically salivating over, wants to take the fabric between his teeth and slowly pull it off her long, honey legs. 

  He elegantly cocks his brow. 

  Now he’s desperate for her, always will be, but he’ll always win this little game she likes to play. 

  Teasing him until he’s begging her. 

  He’s all for begging, especially if it’s begging Hermione Granger. But the thing about games is just how much he loves to win, and seeing that pretty pout of hers when she loses is like drugs to him. 

  Fucking addicting. 

  But the best part is making that pout into a smile, then the loud moan that escapes her lips as he apologizes by lapping at her cunt like it’s a lolly. She would refuse to make any noise but when she does, it’s a reward. 

  It’s the high of the drugs. 

  “Little minx.” 

  “Have you got a reason for interrupting my reading? You know how I feel about that, baby.” It’s like she’s chastising a petulant child. But her voice is velvety, he’ll never get tired of hearing her. 

  Baby. 

  
    Fuck. 
  

  
    Call me that again. 
  

  He briefly squeezes her ankles, rubs the bone with the pad of his thumb. It’s something he does, rubs at where his fingers are. He thinks of it as giving her subtle affection. 

  He, then, let’s both ankles go, and begins to climb in between her legs. 

  “You remember what happened the last time you interrupted, isn’t that right?” Her voice is soft and velvety, and doesn't match the words slipping out of her mouth. If he hadn’t been enchanted by her, he would’ve worried. 

  It wasn’t supposed to be a slow and predatory crawl but it felt right since she’s the one that started this game. She bore her eyes into his as he crawled, glazed her tongue along her bottom lip. 

  His gaze never leaves her, taking in every subtle movement she makes. He watches as blood rushes to her cheeks, sees how her pupils dilate even as she teases and denies him.  

  And slowly, his head was aligned with her thighs. 

  
    What if…?
  

  He begins to lower his head, 
  
    slowly
  
  , 
  
    teasingly
  
  , eyes never leaving hers. 

  He plants a kiss on her thigh, moves a little higher and plants another. 

  She audibly exhales. The next breath she takes is cut off. His tongue trailing up her thighs is a weakness of hers. And he 
  
    loves 
  
  taking advantage of the fact that he knows that. 

  He puts both of her thighs over his shoulders. 

  His movements are slow and deliberate. He can’t — won’t — rush into this, especially when she’s so hellbent on making him suffer. 

  Then as if Merlin himself gave him a gift, he’d noticed the wet spot on her knickers. If that didn’t make his pride fucking overload, he doesn’t know what will. 

  His eyes flit up to hers, a devious smirk splitting his lips. Her blush reaches down the collar of his jersey, and he’s absolutely certain it reaches down to her neck and perfect tits. 

  He lowers his head and places his lips on the dark fabric. Fucking Salazar, he loves doing this to her. The noises, the pulls, the begging. It’s all so perfect when it comes to 
  
    her. 
  

  Her fingers tangle in his fringe, pulling his face hard and tight against her cunt. 

  “
  
    Malfoy…”
  

  He tightens the grip he has on her thighs, squeezing as hard as he can. 

  
    Just fucking suffocate me these thighs. 
  

  “That’s not my name,” he breathes against her. The exhale hitting her cunt and making her squirm around him. “Say my name, baby, and I’ll think about giving you a treat.”

  “I’m not a puppy, for fuck sakes, just 
  
    please
  
  ,” she whines over him, pushing his face harder against her sweet cunt. 

  “That’s how you talk to me,” he darts his tongue out against her knickers, finding her clit over the fabric and sucking so fervently, “when you’re here begging me to eat your cunt?” 

  
    Fuck. 
  

  The moan she released made him quake, sending a pleasurable shiver down his spine. She has never been this needy, and he’s starting to love just how needy he can make her. 

  So he decides that she has had enough pleasure as of right now. Maybe if she’d been nicer to him, he’d give her a little more. 

  And so, he places one last peck against her thigh and starts to move up to her neck, hands touching and teasing anywhere they can. 

  “No, no, no, please, baby,” she whines as she tries to push him back down. “I need you. 
  
    Please.
  
  ” She’s panting like they’ve just finished three rounds; he’d done that with just a few licks and kisses over a piece of fabric. 

  This feels better than it should. 

  He ignores her pleas much to his sorrow and begins to kiss up the column of her throat. The kisses are wet and slow, savoring the taste of her honey skin that he just loves so much. She wraps her legs around his waist, the book completely forgotten as he is the object of her attention. 

  He leaves her throat, it bobs as she swallows, placing  kisses to her chin and on her nose, connects their eyes and just admires the swirl of honey and flecks of green in them. 

  He’d die a happy man looking into those eyes. 

  Her fingers find his fringe, entangling them and tugging as hard as she can. She maneuvers his head and aligns their lips together, smashes her lips against his. 

  Their teeth clash.

  He doesn’t kiss her back though, moves back and watches as she attempts to follow him. When she realizes he won’t kiss her, she opens her eyes. 

  Her eyes flit between his, brows furrowing. 

  Now’s the time. 

  “I win.” An evil grin graces his face. 

  And then she realizes everything. 

  She slowly catches her breath and begins to unwrap her legs from his waist. Her eyes aren’t clouded by arousal anymore but of irritation. Her mouth shuts and she clenches her jaw. Her eyes trace every inch of his face. 

  “You cheated.” Her voice is low and hoarse. She hates losing. “You are so foul.” 

  He quirks a brow at her choice in words and he bites his lip as he throws her words around in his head. 

  “Ah yes, how did it go? ‘
  
    foul, loathsome, evil, little cockroach?’ 
  
  It’s not good to be a sore loser,” he chides, grinning so wide it could be considered a smile. 

  She smacks his shoulder but doesn’t respond, is too upset to even look at him. 

  “Aw, baby, don’t be upset. You started this, I just wanted to cuddle… possibly get a few kisses.” He brought his thumb to her cheek and stroked. It trailed down to her lip; he dragged it down so he could see her teeth. 

  She doesn’t meet his eyes, turns her head to the side as she crosses her arms over her chest. Her chest rises and falls as she clenches her jaw so hard he thinks she might truly be upset. 

  “You could’ve just told me that instead of getting me wet,” she sighs, leaning against the hand on her cheek. “And you won’t even help me now. I’ll just have to stay like this until it passes, 
  
    if 
  
  it passes.”

  She’s right. He won’t help, not this time anyways. He’d done all this to avoid upsetting her to the point where she’ll ignore him. And he truly just wants to cuddle, wants her to hold him, wants to lay on her chest. 

  “If I’d told you, you would’ve ignored me.” She rolls her eyes at him and he takes her chin in his fingers. “And if I’d taken the book, you would’ve ignored me for the rest of the day.” He gently kisses her lips. 

  She only stares at him. Her cheeks are still flushed and breaths are even though her nostrils continue to be slightly flared. 

  He sighs, starting to feel a bit guilty. He leans his head and buries his face in her neck the way he’d been wanting to. He places his hand on the side of her thigh and rests his weight on top of her. 

  “I just wanted to cuddle,” he murmurs, pecking her neck with his lips. “I only opened your legs because I was gonna make space for me to lay down on you.” Another kiss followed by another with a soft squeeze to her thigh. “I’m sorry, baby.”

  He feels her lips press a kiss against his crown. Her hands find his locks and massage his scalp as her legs wrap snugly around his waist. 

  “You have nothing to apologize for, Draco.” He lifts his face from her neck to watch her. She places her hand on his cheek and caresses his cheekbone. “Next time, all you have to do is use your words.” A small smile lifts her face. 

  He goes in to peck her lips before a wide smile consumes his face. And she smiles back. There’s this twinkle in her chocolate eyes that makes him feel all warm and brings a flush to his cheeks. 

  Then, he takes his hand from her thigh and reaches to the floor to get the book. He brings it to her and says, “Can you read to me?” He says it so sweetly and it’s something he truly wants. Listening to her speak is music to his ears. 

  A rather dashing smile splits her face. She looks so beautiful when she smiles. Her dimples, eye crinkles, lip biting, it’s all so Hermione Granger and he loves every part of it. 

  “Yeah, baby, I can.” She looks at him longingly; it makes his heart stutter. 

  The smile on his face strains his face, it’s so wide he can’t help it. 

  She takes the book into her fingers and returns to the page she was on before he’d interrupted. She adjusts herself on the couch before her eyes turn to him. 

  “Have you ever read 
  
    Pride and Prejudice
  
  ?” 

  “Yeah. A couple of times.” He watches her carefully. 

  Her eyes widen slightly and crimson overtakes her cheeks. Her tongue darts out over her lips and she leans in to kiss him. It’s soft and sweet and everything he could ever want in a kiss. 

  He brings his head to her neck once more and waits for her to begin. His fingers stroke soft circles on her thigh and he presses kisses onto her neck. 

  “
  
    Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humor, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been sufficient to make his wife understand his character..” 
  

  Her voice flows through the air like a melody. It soothes his mind and relaxes him. 

  And as she reads the words on the pages, he commits this memory to his mind to forever remember it. 

  
    April  13, 2005
  

  “
  
    Shh, darling, don’t cry. It’s only going to hurt for a few minutes,” Mum cooed, rubbing his back as he cried into her neck. “Mummy has got you, my dear boy.”
  

  
    He’d been practicing riding his broom, and had wanted to be ready for when it was his time to go to Hogwarts, but he’d done a rather hard dive thinking he could stick it. He ended up falling and breaking his arm. 
  

  
    She summoned her wand, pausing for a moment to recall the spell she needed to heal him. And she got it, his arm stopped hurting and it felt amazing. 
  

  
    It’d hurt and Father only stood there berating him for trying a trick he knew he couldn’t achieve, while he cried over the agony that coursed through his left arm. 
  

  
    Draco had believed in himself. Father did not. 
  

  
    He pulled his hand to his chest, feeling if it was truly alright. The pain was unimaginable, hurting more than anything he had ever felt. 
  

  
    He lifted his face from Mum’s neck, and her hand came up to his cheek, wiping away the tears that had stained his cheeks. 
  

  
    Then she placed a kiss on his forehead. “There, there, you feel better?” Her fingers combed down his locks, smoothing the disheavelness. 
  

  
    He only nodded, having not trusted his voice. 
  

  
    She pressed another kiss against his cheek. 
  

  
    He threw himself on her, throwing his arms around her neck and hugging her tight. Nothing felt as amazing as being in Mummy’s arms. 
  

  
    -
  

  
    Mum, 
  

  
    I love you. 
  

  
    I thought Hogwarts was supposed to be fun. 
  

  
    I hate it here. 
  

  
    I miss you so much. 
  

  
    My bed is always cold. Can I go back home and be with you?
  

  
    I love you, 
  

  
    Draco
  



    My dear boy,
  

  
    I love you. 
  

  
    We’ll see each other soon but, in the meanwhile, enjoy Hogwarts. It’ll be gone before you know it. 
  

  
    I miss you too.
  

  
    I love you, 
  

  
    Mum

    He softly shakes her from sleep, hoping she doesn’t get too upset with him. 
  

  
    “Mum, can I sleep with you? I don’t want to sleep alone.” It was a gentle whisper full of fear. “It’s too cold and I want you to hold me.”
  

  
    Father said he was too old to be sleeping in their bed and so he gave him his own. But Draco missed the warmth only his mum could give him at night. 
  

  
    So when Father was out of town on some business Draco always found his way to Mummy’s room, waking her up so she’d let him onto the bed, and sleeping in the arms of his mum. 
  

  
    “Come here, my dragon.” Her voice was sleepy and quiet, gentle arms. 
  

  
    He climbed into her arms, laying his head on her chest and throwing his arm over her middle. 
  

  
    She was his comfort and his best friend. 
  

  
    He had slept so peacefully. A sleep he hadn’t had in months because of Father. 
  

  
    He used to shiver in his empty bed and cry because he missed his mum. But tonight he didn’t have to. 
  

  
    -
  

  
    Mum,
  

  
    I hope you’re doing well and I love you. 
  

  
    I got into the Slytherin Quidditch Team. All that hard work paid off. I couldn’t have done it without you. 
  

  
    But some frizzy haired girl tried to tell me Father paid for my success. I called her a “filthy, little mudblood.” 
  

  
    I feel like I should apologize, but I doubt Father would approve of that. 
  

  
    I love you,
  

  
    Draco 
  
 
  
    My dragon, 
  

  
    I’m doing well, my dear boy, and I love you. 
  

  
    I’m so proud of you. You’ll be a wonderful player. 
  

  
    It was harsh for a little comment to call that girl a mudblood. I think you should apologize. If your father has something to say, he can talk to me about it. 
  

  
    I hope you have a good season, my dragon. 
  

  
    I love you,
  

  
    Mum
  

  
    -
  

  
    He hugged her tightly, squeezing in every bit of love into her he could. He kissed her cheek and said, “Happy Birthday, Mum.”
  

  
    Her birthday was in July, so he was able to spend it with her. 
  

  
    He’d woken her up at exactly midnight. It was her birthday after all. He’d helped the house elves make a cake for her, her favorite flavor and her favorite colored frosting. 
  

  
    He had carefully planned just how he’d surprise her: what to say, how to wake her up, what to do once she does. 
  

  
    Then, he walked with Dobby to her bedroom and gently shook her out of sleep. He sang her the happy birthday song and gave her a kiss on the cheek. 
  

  
    “My dragon… ” Her voice was full of sleep. “Come here.”
  

  
    He sat at the edge of the bed as she pulled him into her arms. And whispered happy birthdays and gave kisses. 
  

  
    “Dobby and I baked this, would you like some?” His voice was full of joy and eagerness. 
  

  
    She nods and has a piece in her hand in just a few seconds. She made sounds of delight once she tasted the sweetness. It had made all the difference because she rarely ever ate sweets, especially at this time of night. 
  

  
    She’d loved it; tears fell down her cheeks. He wiped them away, giving her a happy smile. 
  

  
    “Did you like it?” His smile radiated like a sun. He had felt so happy that she enjoyed his surprise. 
  

  
    “I loved it.” She kissed his forehead. “Thank you, my dear boy.” He smiled at the nickname she had always called him. He loved it when it was she that said it. 
  

  
    “I love you, my dragon.”
  

  
    “I love you too, Mum.”
  

  
    -
  

  
    Mum,
  

  
    I love you. 
  

  
    Are you alright? Has Father done anything? Tell me you’re alright. 
  

  
    Can I come back home? I want you safe. 
  

  
    I love you,
  

  
    Draco 
  
 
  
    Draco,
  

  
    I love you, my dear boy. 
  

  
    I’m fine. Don’t worry about anything. I’ll handle it. 
  

  
    You’ll stay at school. I must know you’re safe. 
  

  
    I love you,
  

  
    Mum
  

  
    -
  

  
    His arm burned. He sobbed into her neck, clinging onto her like his life depended on it. His body was on fire, sweat covered his body. 
  

  
    “Shh, it’ll be alright. Everything will be alright, my dragon.” Her voice was shaky. She was going to cry, too. She was scared and he could feel it in the same way she felt his pain. “There, there.”
  

  
    His body shook with the painful sobs that wracked his chest. His head throbbed as did his heart. 
  

  
    He hadn’t wanted the mark, but Aunt Bella held him down as The Dark Lord branded him. Parsel tongue and evil words slipping from his mouth and through his wand and to his forearm. 
  

  
    He cried like a child and he was ashamed. 
  

  
    Shouldn’t he have wanted this? Shouldn’t this have been an honor? 
  

  
    Father said it was the highest honor for a Malfoy but this feels like anything but. This feels how he imagined hell to be like. 
  

  
    He should be happy. He should be proud. 
  

  
    He closed his eyes and the only thing he saw was The Dark Lord’s snake-like eyes, red and evil. 
  

  
    “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” She repeated against his fringe, tears falling into his scalp. “We’ll be okay.”
  

  
    And even though he was taller than her by more than a foot, she was able to guide him to his room as he leaned his weight onto her. 
  

  
    She took off his sweat-soaked trousers and button-up, leaving him in his briefs. She took a cloth and dried the sweat of his temples and neck, placing a cooling charm on his body. 
  

  
    She lied by his side and held him in her arms, placing kisses on head and murmuring whatever she could say to make him feel better. 
  

  
    “My dragon, you must do what he says. You cannot disobey him or we’ll all die.” She was severe all of a sudden and it only intensified his sobs. “Draco, tell me you understand.”
  

  
    “Yes, Mum, I do.” His voice was hoarse and it hurt to speak. 
  

  
    He hated himself and what he had to do. He hated how he was forced into this because of Lucius. And most most of all he hated what Mum had to go through. 
  

  
    Draco Malfoy is a failure. Draco Malfoy is a coward. Draco Malfoy is a scumbag. Draco Malfoy should be dead. 
  

  
    -
  

  
    Mum,
  

  
    I love you. 
  

  
    I’m scared. Please tell me you’re okay. 
  

  
    Why can’t we just run away? Me and you?
  

  
    I love you,
  

  
    Draco
  
 
  
    My dear boy, 
  

  
    I love you. I love you very much. 
  

  
    Don’t be scared. I’ve got you from afar. 
  

  
    I’m just fine. 
  

  
    We cannot run away. I’m sorry, darling. 
  

  
    We’ll survive this, we’ll get through this. Me and you. 
  

  
    I love you always,
  

  
    Mum
  

  
    -
  

  
    Mum,
  

  
    I love you. 
  

  
    How are you? I miss you. 
  

  
    I wish I could hug you. 
  

  
    Tell me you’re safe. 
  

  
    Draco
  
 
  
    My dragon,
  

  
    I love you. 
  

  
    I’m well. 
  

  
    We’ll be together in a couple of months. 
  

  
    I'm safe. 
  

  
    Hurry up with the mission, my dear boy.
  

  
    I love you,
  

  
    Mum
  

  
    -
  

  
    Her arms wrapped tightly against his frame. It was long and he won’t ever complain, relishing in the way she felt in his arms and the way he felt safe in hers. 
  

  
    He missed her and the stress of leaving her in Malfoy Manor nearly fucked up the Vanishing Caninet mission. He still hadn’t finished it either, and it frightened him to the core. 
  

  
    She looked pale and there were tremors in her hands. There were purple crescents under her eyes and she didn’t look like Narcissa Malfoy at all. 
  

  
    “You lied to me.” It hurt. 
  
  
    She
  
  
     hurt. 
  

  
    “Shh, we are together now, Draco.”
  

  
    He couldn’t bring himself to say anything but, “I love you.” His throat hurt, his head hurt, everything hurt and he just wanted his mum to hold him. 
  

  
    “I love you, too, my dear boy.” She still called him that. And hearing it always brought a semblance of comfort. “We will be okay. We’ll go to Italy. I am going to keep you safe.”
  

  
    “Promise?”
  

  
    “I promise, my dragon.”
  

  
    -
  

  
    That was the last time he’d seen her, spoken to her. When she held him for dear life and quietly cried on his shoulder. He hadn’t mentioned it when he’d noticed because he knew she was trying to be strong for him. 
  

  
    The only other time he’d seen her was the day it happened. The day she was taken away from him, the day he’d lost the person he’d loved most in the world. 
  

  
    It wasn’t quick or painless, it was long, filled with pain, and ripped her dignity to shreds
  
  . 
  
    It ripped him to shreds. 
  

  
    Voldemort had determined that Draco was far too hesitant with things. He’d been lenient with him but that enough is enough and so he needed to be punished. 
  

  
    Punishment is getting crucioed. Punishment is 
  
  
    not
  
  
     being forced to watch his mum get raped and tortured. That is no punishment. That is cruel. 
  

  
    Cruel. 
  

  
    
      Cruel. 
    
  

  
    Because that was his mum and no boy should ever be forced to have to witness something like that. He was just a fucking boy. 
  

  
    Why? 
  

  
    Why me?
  

  
    Why 
  
  
    
      her
    
  
  
    ? 
  

  
    He would’ve preferred anything in the world than to have to see this, than for his mum to have experienced this. 
  

  
    Nothing would ever compare to the feelings he’d felt that night. The aching pain in his chest, the trembling in his knees, the tears that burned and blurred his eyes, the brick in his throat that choked him. 
  

  
    Every detail of that day was engraved into his head like spells and wand movements. And sometimes he wishes it’d been him, because Mum had not deserved that. She deserves the world and happiness and smiles and laughter that makes her ribs hurt. 
  

  
    She didn’t deserve to be humiliated, be violated, be carved into like a fucking pumpkin. Her last moments shouldn’t have been spent in agony. She should’ve died in peace, holding his hand. 
  

  
    It was disturbing. It made him sick to his stomach. 
  

  
    And Lucius. 
  

  
    That sorry fuck just stared. There was no wincing or reaction. Just a face that was there. No emotions because apparently his wife didn’t deserve it. 
  

  
    Watching this left a hole in his heart he doesn’t think would ever be fixed. It killed him. 
  

  
    He watched her bleed out, bare, tears staining her cheeks, and the flush of embarrassment tinting her hollow cheeks. 
  

  
    She deserved more than that. She deserved respect. 
  

  
    Her lost words, forever etched into his mind: “I love you, my dear boy. We’ll be in Italy soon. Me and you.” Those words have never hurt more. 
  

  
    Italy. The place they should be packing for, the place that he’d thought he’d get to go to, the place she promised to take him. And now he’d never get to go. 
  

  
    -
  

  He always wrote to his mum on this day. 

  It’s the anniversary of her death after all. Each year that passes, it hurts even worse. A larger weight buries itself into his aching chest. 

  So when he’d gotten up and headed towards his desk, grabbing a piece of parchment and quill and sitting down, he couldn’t do it. 

  He couldn’t fathom words to describe how badly it hurt. He couldn’t write, couldn’t think, and didn’t know anything but the pain that coursed through every vein in his body. 

  It’d hit him like a bludger.

  It has been six years since she died. Six years since she was taken from him. And six years since he’d been left alone to survive the war and survive the aftermath. 

  He misses her. Misses her smile, her hugs, her warmth, her infectious laughter, her nicknames for him, her everything. He misses everything that was Narcissa Malfoy. 

  It is exceptionally lonely being Draco Malfoy. 

  But it wasn’t just being him. It was being born into the world he was, having Lucius Malfoy as a father, having prejudices engraved into him as a kid. It was everything he could’ve changed but didn’t and everything he could’ve done to prevent his mum’s fate. 

  “Baby…” 

  He hadn’t noticed she was standing there, watching him cry over a piece of parchment. 

  What does she think? That he’s pathetic? Crying over some parchment like a child?

  But it isn’t just parchment. It’s the way he chose to cope. And his way has proved inefficient. He couldn’t describe how much he loved and missed her because no words would ever truly work. So he can’t write to her this year. 

  And that in itself crumbled him. 

  She took him out of his thoughts when she placed her hand on his cheek and turned his face towards her, stroking his cheek and placing her other hand on the back of his neck. 

  “Draco, baby, what’s wrong?” Her voice is soft and sweet, concern etched into it. There was no mockery laced into it and for that he is thankful for. “Why’re you crying?”

  He couldn’t fathom his voice or words to even say. It hurts to even think. He could only look at her, seeing her worried eyes and frown etched onto her lips. 

  There’s a lump in his throat, making it hard to swallow, hard to breathe, hard to even think. His heart thumps painfully against his chest. 

  He leans onto her hand, taking whatever comfort he can, tears in his eyes falling as he falls apart. 

  Her brows furrow and so she pulls him into her arms, hugging him as tight as she can. And he lets it all go; all the tears, all the sobs, all the screams, and everything he holds inside of himself year-around. 

  He holds onto her so tightly he thinks he’s hurting her but she only holds him just as tight or even tighter. 

  She strokes his hair and presses kisses onto his head and just stays with him. She rubs his back and murmurs pretty things onto his locks. 

  And that is how it is for a while. He doesn’t know how long, all he knows is that it was long enough and that at some point through the ticking time, she’d brought them to the bedroom. 

  She’d put him on the bed and layed next to him, pulling him close to her. He’d placed his head on her chest and listened to her heart beat. 

  It means she’s alive. 

  Alive. 

  A lucky person will never have to know the pain of losing a mother as a child, will ever know the pain of being forced to watch their mother suffer, but unfortunately Draco Malfoy has never had an ounce of luck throughout his meaningless life. 

  He hugs her tightly there too as she does the same. She strokes his cheek and cries into her neck, holding onto her like if he lets go she’ll leave. 

  Eventually he’ll fall asleep and wake up still in her arms. His head will hurt and she’ll give him a pain relief draught. He’ll put his hand under her shirt and onto her stomach, relishing in the warmth. She’ll glide her fingers through his pale fringe and smile at him. He won’t say a word but he’ll kiss her to show her how grateful he is that she was there for him when he really needed. 

  May 2, 2005

  They're not going to Potter's house this year. 

  Every year they'd go and feel out of place. Out of sorts. Because, while everyone chose to ignore the emptiness in their chests, he and Granger basked in the darkness and loneliness. 

  They never attempted to forget or ignore the ache that ran throughout their chests, pretended the stinging in their eyes wasn't actually there. 

  It wasn't healthy the way they dealt with it, but Potter and the rest of them are only adding to an already full cauldron. They are so close to exploding and that'll only cause them more pain. 

  They felt the pain too unbearable, so they pushed it away, ignored it. 

  The pain nearly destroyed him and Granger, but they found peace in one another. They held each other afloat, as the aching feeling in their chests pulled them under the surface. 

  They’d been dancing along the edge throughout the years and during those pointless celebrations. 

  Draco isn't much for shaming how anyone chooses to cope because his way wasn't very ethical when it came to his own well-being. It kept him in that dark hole he dug for himself, it suffocated him. 

  Some coping mechanisms are healthier than some. But don't they get them all to the same place? He can't fathom an answer. 

  This year has been easier than the last despite his breaking down a month before. 

  The guilt isn't suffocating him, his mind doesn’t haunt him with those terrible thoughts, and he can look at Granger without the tinge in his chest that has always repeated to him just how unworthy of it all he is. 

  Last month, he’d grieved the way he needed to. Before, he’d just ignored the ache in his chest and drowned in the painful reminders that sat in his flat.

  He didn’t let himself weep or mourn his mum, believed he didn’t have any right to because he’d done thing but stand there like some fucking coward. 

  But she did the one thing no one had ever done: she’d held and reassured him. It meant the most because she knew who he was and still said all those pretty things to him. 

  He needs his mum and he wishes for just a single moment more with her. She’d hold him and murmur how much she loved him. And that’s all he really needed. 

  Granger gave that to him, minus the maternal part of it all. 

  But Granger, she’s…

  She has  been struggling with herself as the days led up to today. She barely slept, ate, and there was never a day where she wasn’t overthinking or fidgeting. 

  Soon after, he saw as the dark crescents under her eyes grew, he saw how uncharacteristically quiet she got. 

  This all led to his own share of overthinking and a stream of questions Draco could never fathom an answer to. 

  
    Is she okay?
  

  
    Is this because of me?
  

  
    Is she ashamed of me?
  

  He tried to mask his hurt when he thought one of the reasons for her worsened state was because of the thought of being seen with him was worth worrying about. 

  He’d thought she didn’t want her friends to know about him and all the things they’ve done together. 

  Because, although he has proven himself to her, showed her how capable of giving and feeling love he is, said the pretty words he meant with every single emotion he could fathom, the world has never seen this side of him and neither of her measly friends. 

  Friends. 

  
    Friends. 
  

  But she'd said she didn't care for her friends' opinions, said that they didn’t have any right to have an opinion on who she decided to fuck and what not, said that if they had a fucking problem, they could go ahead and shove off. 

  “
  
    They haven’t been very good friends to me for a while. They chose to ignore and invalidate me when we should’ve been there to comfort each other.”
  

  And he couldn’t agree more. They don’t deserve a friend like her. 

  He won’t lie and say that he deserved her more than they did but the difference between him and them is that she picked him because she felt like he deserved her. 

  So, when she finally voiced her concerns, he drew her into his arms — feeling the warmth of her arms wrapping around him — and pressed a few kisses against her crown as he murmured little words of reassurance. 

  And then he’d asked her to stay. 

  He hadn't wanted to go to Potter's.

  Draco never has been a fan of going or being around the little clan for a number of reasons. But they were the only people that looked at him with nothing but welcome. They didn’t sneer or spit at him. It felt oddly warm because this certain group of people could look at him and invite him to a gathering meant to commemorate the people whose deaths he caused, so maybe there was some hope for him. 

  And they were familiar. He’d known that for years and that sense made it easier to overcome the weight of what that day meant. 

  It also never hurt that she was there. He’d never leaned on the fact that her presence was comfortable because as far as he’d been concerned, she hated him and everything he stood for. 

  He couldn’t tie himself to her, knowing damn well she hated his guts. That would’ve just been him setting himself up for failure. 

  But alas, he was wrong and for once in his forsaken life he’s willing to admit it. He’ll admit it because without him having been proved wrong, he won’t feel the amount of euphoria he feels on a daily basis. 

  But the days leading up to today weren't easy on him either. He still struggles with the guilt of what happened at Hogwarts and hates himself for being a coward. 

  He takes fault for all the children's lives that were taken as does she. And maybe no amount of words will ever make him forgive himself because the part he played in the war will never be pardoned. 

  Granger though, she was on the good side. She fought and did as much as she could. She was only a kid herself, juggling the weight of the world on her shoulders. 

  He’ll never say this to her but she couldn’t have saved everyone, couldn’t be there to prevent the unpreventable.

  She’d say something along the lines of, “
  
    I shouldn’t get to choose who lives and dies. That’s not something I’m supposed to have to choose.”
  

  She wouldn’t be wrong with that statement but she would be with the part on where she 
  
    gets 
  
  to choose. Because she doesn’t. No one gets to choose who dies and survives, especially not Hermione Granger. 

  It’s a misinterpretation of the scene that she’ll need to learn to view correctly. He can’t — won’t — help her with that. It’s something that she needs to figure out on her own so she could learn to forgive herself. 

  And so, they’re here at home, comforting each other. 

  He knows she isn’t at fault. She thinks he’s redeemable. 

  Now, they sit in silence. Her head rests on his shoulder as he twirls a curl on his finger. Her legs are curled up next to her, and he sits upright with his legs propped on the coffee table with his head rested on hers. 

  She strokes her fingers along his neck and places kisses every so often. And he nuzzles his cheek in her hair as he presses kisses every couple of minutes. 

  It's a peaceful sort of silence that has surrounded them, still and comforting. It lacks everything it used to before and has everything he always wished it had. 

  The only noise that can be heard is her soft breathing and quiet sniffles. He’s quiet, though. But the tears that silently slide across his cheeks onto her chocolate curls are ever-present. 

  Her friends never gave her an opportunity to grieve, because she’s Hermione Granger. She didn’t lose anything in the war, she didn’t make sacrifices. 

  But she did. She lost so much, lost just as much as them. 

  The things she’d seen and the things she’d sacrificed… she just needed someone to hold, be there for her. 

  And no one was. 

  It’s fucking selfish. 

  And he… he needed it like she did. Needed someone that didn't hate him, needed someone that looked at him with adoration and not contempt, needed someone who wouldn’t fake things with him, needed someone real. 

  When one of them was having trouble finding a steady ground to stand on, the other would offer a steady hand to keep the other steady. 

  And in a soft moment of silence, she lifted her head from his shoulder, and gazed at him as he gazed at her. 

  Tears stained her cheeks and he’s sure he looks the same way. He leans in to wipe her tears and she does the same with him. 

  In the next moment, she leans forward and presses her lips to his. It speaks volumes in only a few movements. 

  They finally got their peace. 

  June 5, 2005

  He's sitting on his chaise, mug in hand and right leg crossed over his left, when hands come up behind him to cover his eyes. They're warm and clammy and soft. He smirks, knows exactly who it is. 

  He feels light breathing on his right ear. 

  "Happy birthday," she says, placing a kiss on his cheek. 

  His lips split into a smile. "Why thank you."

  "I have a surprise for you." Her voice is low and he recognizes her intentions just by the tone and slow drawl of her words. She swipes the tip of her tongue slowly along the shell of his ear. A slight shiver courses through his spine. 

  "Yeah?" he asks, voice a bit strained. 

  "Yeah," she murmurs. 

  She peppers slow, open-mouthed kisses down his nape and licks a stripe up his neck as she makes her way back up. 

  His fingers tighten on the mug handle — taut and white. 

  "Keep your eyes closed for me," she says as she removes her hands from his eyes, lightly caresses her thumb along his cheek as she pulls away. 

  He obliges. His face flushes as the anticipation increases. 

  A moment passes, he hears shuffling from behind and then in front of him. Feels her take the mug from his fingers and hears the clink of it against the coffee table. 

  He feels her lightly trail her fingers along his thigh and upwards, massages his inner-thigh the same she does his cock. She gets very close to his cock but it seems like that was always her destination because she stops and cups him. 

  His breath hitches. 

  His eyes are still closed as he feels her lips touch his. She lightly brushes their lips together. A soft tease as she puts pressure on his cock. It's a good kind of pressure, making his hips jerk up involuntarily. 

  He struggles to keep his eyes shut. The anticipation is weighing on his self-control. 

  She slowly palms him once. He bites his bottom lip, eyebrows draw together, and clenches his eyes shut as the prickles of soft pleasure invade his senses. 

  "Those lips are mine to bite," she murmurs, tightens her grip on his clothed cock. "You'd do well to respect that." She lightly kisses him only to sink her teeth into the lip he bit and drags it out. 

  "Open your eyes." 

  He's met with her chocolate irises, bottom lip still in between her teeth. Freckles scattered all around her nose and cheeks, and wild curls hung over her shoulders just the way she knows he loves. 

  She bites his lip harder, enough to draw blood, and he hisses. "My lips to bite, understand?" She sucks on the blood, her favorite thing to do. 

  His face flames and his trousers tighten. "Mhm, yours." She has never referred to any part of him as hers, it left him an utter mess. He didn't think she was into that sort of thing, that she wasn't something someone could possess, so he refrained from saying such things to her. 

  She releases his lip but leaves the small amount of space between them. 

  The anticipation growing inside of him is slowly becoming less and less manageable. He'll lose his control soon enough and this little dominant act of hers will come to an end. 

  "It's your birthday." She comes just a bit closer, noses grazing and eye contact getting much more intense, if that's even possible. "Birthdays call for gifts and surprises." She smirks. 

  That fucking smirk. He has seen it before and fuck because he knows what it means. And double fuck because he's so impatient, he's about to ruin her plans and just fuck her into his chaise. 

  Her eyes sparkle. Not with that of innocence but of pure and utter sin. He has got a feeling today will be much different than those that they've spent together before. And the exhilaration of it has his blood singing with delight. 

  He gives her a smirk, one of understanding. 

  "But there'll be some rules." She tangles her other hand in his locks, tightens her grip on both hands, making him roll his eyes back. 

  "Can't even give me a break on my birthday," he whispers, cups her right cheek. He says it just to have it out there, knows that Hermione Granger has never been one to give if not earned. 

  "No." She places a chaste kiss on his lips. 

  He drags her closer to steal another kiss. The last one had been far too short for his liking. And of course she lets him. It's his birthday after all. 

  She pulls back, biting on the side of her lip like she's some nervous first year. It would've been cute if he knew just what's on her mind. But she's a mystery to him. The way her mind works is something he will never understand but maybe that's the beauty of it. Of her. 

  "Rules, baby." He lowers his hand to where hers is, on his cock, and squeezes. He clenches his jaw but his gaze never leaves hers. "Give them to me, or I'll just take what I want." His eyes flit down to her pretty pink lips and back to her eyes. 

  She leans in, nose grazes his cheek and runs along his jaw. Her lips touch his neck, wet and hot. She kisses it chastely, then sucks softly as her hand caresses his pulse-point. 

  "Number one: you'll enjoy yourself," she murmurs. Teeth slightly nibbling on his neck, ripples of want and absolute necessity glazes over him. "I want to hear and see it."

  Surely she's not —

  She tightens her grip even more. It isn't just bursts of pleasure that lessens as she speaks, it's continuous now. It's never ending, like it's constantly there. And she controls it... he finds he might like it. 

  "Number two: you'll be selfish." She grazes their noses together and slightly leans in. He goes for another kiss, but she backs away a few inches just before he can. 

  "Tease." His tone is a low timbre, filled with arousal, need, and slight irritation. It's all for her. 

  She smirks mockingly at him and not a second later leans in to swipe her tongue along his bottom lip. The devious glint in her eyes only proves him just how likely she is to make him wait, edge him. 

  "Don't interrupt me, baby, I don't want to have to punish you on your special day," she breathes, gaze stuck on his swollen and bruised lips. 

  She seems so affected by her own ministrations on him. Maybe it's his obedience... maybe he wants to be a good boy for her, maybe she'll reward him by breathing a little heavier, flushing a little darker, biting her lip a bit harder, tightening her hand on his cock a little more. 

  "You're so strict," he says breathlessly. 

  An evil smirk splits her lips. "I expect so much from you, baby, and disobeying me is not acceptable."

  His face flames. He'll be the fucking good boy she expects, might even be the best for her. Only her. 

  "I'll be your good boy. I promise."

  She looks so proud, so prideful, so utterly triumphant. 

  "Selfish, you'll be selfish," she repeats against his lips. He felt every motion of them on his and he just wanted to devour her. Bite and suck on them until they are bruised. "I don't want you to care about me."

  Confusion etches on his face as it does when she says  such vague things. He wants to care about her, wants to give her everything and anything he possibly can. 

  She rubs her thumb on the creases on his forehead, making them go away. 

  It's the sort of gesture he'll never forget. It comforts him when she does it, and makes him melt against her. 

  "Anything you might want from me, you'll take it. I'm here for you and only you. To please you, make you feel good, make you come, anything you want, baby." As the words slipped past her tongue, his cheeks grew hotter and his cock grew stiffer. 

  She looks and sounds like a goddess, and has him so utterly enchanted. She's a dream and he never wants to leave her side, wants to be near her and with her for as long as she'll have him. 

  "Am I understood?"

  "Yes, Ma'am."

  She connects their lips. It's a short kiss but she takes her time as she strokes her tongue against his. The nibbles and soft pecks they both do in between because it’s never just a kiss, it’s always a good snog when it comes to them. 

  Then she pulls away just the smallest amount and says, "you're such a good little pet for me, aren't you."

  
    Fuck
  
  . 
  
    That
  
   fucking name. She'll be the fucking death of him. And he wouldn't want it any other way. 

  "Yes," he breathes, willing to do anything to please her. "Always. Only for you."

  And with that she pulls away completely. 

  For a moment, he thinks his mind is playing tricks on him, that this is too good to be true. And so he blinks, blinks until it's quite obvious how very real this all actually is. 

  Salazar's fucking sake, Draco Malfoy is the fucking luckiest man to ever walk the Earth. Having the Golden Girl like 
  
    this
  
   for 
  
    him
  
  ? Fucking sheer luck got him to where he sits today. 

  He's in for a very long day and not one complaint will ever be thought of or heard of from him. 

  The first thing he'd noticed was the choker on her neck. It's emerald green with a silver pendant. His eyes widened when he'd seen it, nearly fucking lost any and all self-control he'd been clinging onto. 

  But when he sees what's engraved into it... his mind goes completely blank — still. Well no, still wouldn't be a correct way to word it because the wheels ran as fast as his mind would allow a thought to form. But if one were to open his mind and see those wheels, they'd look still. The speed they're going at is far too fast for one's eyes to catch. 

  
    Mine. 
  

  
    What is this minx doing to me?
  

  
    Why... why does my chest feel like that?
  

  
    Sweet fucking Circe, it's Slytherin colors. 
  

  
    Mine. All fucking mine. Fucking mine to keep
  
  . 

  D.M. is engraved into the pendant in emerald green. The letters are cursive and gracefully tilted. And everything about it just makes him all the more possessive over her. 

  She is his. Hermione Granger belongs to Draco Malfoy. And that choker is all the convincing he needs. 

  Fuck if she doesn't look utterly delectable with it on. 

  He took his time examining all of her, and knew there was something different about today. 

  And then his eyes traveled to her chest. 

  This is the moment he realizes. Hermione Granger's tits are his favorite part of her — besides her wonderful personality. 

  The Slytherin green pieces that cover her nipples are triangular. It really only covers her nipples and a little bit of skin. The rest is left on display for him. 

  The curves of every part of her breasts are in sight and he just wants to run his tongue along them. Leave bruises and bite marks as she pulls his hair and gives him those breathy moans that make him go absolutely feral. 

  When he looks a bit closer, he sees the pattern on the lace. It seemed to be squiggly lines but when he truly focused on it, he saw the tiny snakes slithering through the material. The pros of magic. 

  She paid attention to every detail just for him. Made it known that she is his. Fucking blew his mind away with everything. What did he do to deserve her?

  The Golden Girl is dressed in Slytherin everything. The Gryffindor Princess is dressed in Slytherin everything. 

  He just can't wrap his head around it. 

  His gaze roams lower, passes her broad rib cage and wide hips, his favorite place to cling onto while he fucks her into the next week, and his eyes land on the second piece of her set. 

  It leaves 
  
    nothing
  
   to the imagination. 

  The lace outlines her cunt, leaving uninterrupted access for him. 
  
    Only him
  
  . 

  There's a chocolate thatch of curls, trimmed and utterly perfect. It's just the way he likes. And he can see her slightly glistening for him. It's so much he can see it beginning to slide down her thigh. 

  He wants to get on his knees and swipe his tongue along it, keep his eyes glued to hers as he does so. 

  The delicious two-piece fits her like a charm and matches her honey skin perfectly. Like she was born to be fitted in Slytherin colors. Like she was born to be Draco Malfoy's. 

  And when his eyes traveled back up the length of her and to her chocolate irises, her pupils were blown wide, encompassing almost every inch of chocolate in them.

  "You like what you see, baby?" she asks, voice primal and dark. As if his hungry stare made her starved. 

  He can only nod, nod almost aggressively. No words are capable of forming in his mind. The only thing he can process is how fucking beautiful Granger looks. And how badly he'd like to make her scream his name in that pretty fabric she's in. 

  She slowly moves closer to him as if she isn't as needy as him. As if her cunt isn't fucking dripping right in front of him. 

  "Tell me what it is that you like?" she says, eyes gleaming with mischievousness. She has a plan, a downright evil plan. 

  "I don't want to play this game," he says, attempting to mask the nervousness that has suddenly encompassed him. "I want you. 
  
    Now
  
  ."

  She tilts her head to the side. "Oh and you think you get to demand anything?" She's surprised and he feels this sinking feeling in his stomach. It's slow but it's happening. 

  "You said —"

  "Don't," she cuts him off. He thinks he has angered her and being this close to her worries him. 

  She walks closer to him, until she reaches his knees and goes in between them. She cups his face and stares into his mercury irises. 

  "You're a masochist then, yeah?" she asks, confident that it's true. 

  "
  
    What?
  
  " His brows are furrowed and he can't fathom a thought as to how or why she even came up with that conclusion. 

  "Speaking to me like that... you must really want to get punished. And on your birthday of all days." She wraps a lock of his pale hair around her pointer finger. "You've got a death wish, baby."

  He starts to shake his head, just wants her, fucking needs her. She already said she'd give him whatever he wants, and he wants her. 

  "I'll grant it for you." Her hands are on his collar now, traveling to the buttons on his shirt. But before she can pull a button from its place, he places his hands over hers. 

  "Anything I want. That's what you said." Her grip on his button-up tightens, like she knows what's about to happen. 

  "Baby..."

  He grabs her jaw in his palm, brings her face so close to his, grazes the tip of his nose against her jaw, and traces his tongue along the shell of her ear. 

  "I 
  
    want
  
   you to straddle my thigh," he murmurs, other hand coiling in her curls and tugging ever so slightly. "
  
    Now
  
  ."

  And there's the shift in dynamics. She went from strict and dominant to obeying and submitting to him. His good girl. 

  He places his hands on her waist and guides her on to his left thigh. 

  She has told him many times how much she likes his thighs, how the muscles in them make him look so fit, and he'd noticed how she'd always bite into his inner thighs before she'd suck him off. 

  It's time she discovers another use for his thigh. It'll be his favorite one yet, because watching her feel good is what brings his pleasure. Hearing her scream and writhe for him brings him all the pleasure he'd ever need. 

  She only stares, probably doesn't know what to do. They've never done this before, but it's the same as when she rides his cock, is it not?

  He gently squeezes her waist and rubs slow circles on her thigh. Gazes never leave each other. 

  "You." He chastely kisses her lips. "Are going to fuck my thigh." He peppers kisses down the column of her throat, feels her swallow — it's the way she swallows his cum when she sucks him off like a good girl. 

  Her cheeks and neck turn a brighter shade of scarlet. She looks so beautiful like this; straddled on his thigh, a vibrant shade of red on her, tiny Slytherin two-piece, and those 
  
    curls
  
  . Gods he fucking loves those curls. 

  Her hands are wound around his neck, holding herself in place. He feels her warmth, his trousers growing wet at the place where she sits. 

  And then the thought hits him. With a smirk splitting his lips, he brought his fingers to her cunt. At first he teases his finger against her slit, her brows furrow and a breathy moan leaves her lips. She bucks her hips against his finger. 

  "I've barely touched you." He puts more pressure onto his feather-light strokes. "And you're already so needy." His voice is taunting, and loves that he has this effect on her. It's been months and she still gets so tongue-tied and red from his dirty words. 

  "Draco... 
  
    please
  
  ." Her grip on his shoulders tightens, leaving her knuckles white. She's so desperate for him and just a few minutes ago she was ready to punish him. 

  "I ought to punish 
  
    you
  
  ." His smirk turns into a grin, a fucking shit-eating grin or cunt-eating grin depending on how the night goes. He slides two fingers inside of her, doesn't have to move because she instantly begins to fuck his fingers. "You'd deserve it, isn't that right little minx?"

  She throws her head back, a loud, guttural moan escapes her lips. It's like he didn't even ask her a question. He doesn't like that she ignored him all that much, so he takes his fingers out of her. She cries out in frustration, bucks her hips in search of his delicious fingers. 

  "I asked you a question," he says pointedly. He tightens the fingers around his waist. "I expect an answer from you." His face is stoic and he watches as hers contorts into realization. 

  She looks down, as if she’s a child being chastised. Her fingers twiddle with the locks at his nape, while her teeth bite on her lip. 

  She’s nervous. 

  He brings the fingers from her waist to her chin, tilts her head until their gazes meet. 

  It’s a sudden change, from arousal clouding the air to… 

  She’s guilty and she knows it, is ashamed of it. 

  He doesn’t know how he feels about that. 

  He lightly caresses his thumb against her chin, only watches her as she knocks her response against the wheels in her head. 

  She begins to nod her head gently, jaw clenching as she admits it, but her eyes never leave his. Interesting, really. 

  “I do. I do deserve it. To be punished, I mean.” Her words are quiet and meek. But he’d be damned if that Gryffindor courage wasn’t laced in her tone. Even as she says her words so shyly, he could always hear the part of her that would never truly leave her. 

  A smirk pulls at his lips. “Didn’t think you’d admit it.” 

  “But… but just — I can be good. I promise I can be your good girl.” She begins to lift off his thigh to get closer to him, grabs his face in her hands and peppers kisses on his cheeks. “I’ve always been so good for you and — and I want to make you happy on your birthday,” she murmurs against his skin. “I’ll be good.”

  She trails her lips to his neck, laves his pulse-point before lightly gazing her teeth against it. He clenches his jaw, and tangles her curls in his fist. 

  “Yeah?” he says, voice strained. “You’ll be good for me? Be my good girl?”

  “Yes,” she murmurs against his neck. 

  She’s vigorous with the assault on his neck, never leaving him with a single spot not marked with a bite or bruise. Because he belongs to her and there is not a single thing that’ll ever change that. 

  Her hand comes to rest on his shoulder as she sucks his pulse-point harshly. His breathing becomes labored, eyes rolling back. 

  His chest rises and falls rapidly. She has always been good with her mouth, and fuck because she never disappoints. It’s so warm and wet and just the way he loves. He can’t help but imagine how delicious it’d feel to have her lips around his cock again, a whine leaves his lips at just the thought of it. 

  “I’ll be good,” she murmurs continuously. “I’ve always been your good girl, baby, I promise.” She takes his adams apple between her lips, and gently sucks. 

  A moan rips from his throat. That’s his fucking spot, gods she fucking knows that. And just knowing it’s 
  
    her 
  
  lips, 
  
    her tongue
  
  , and 
  
    her 
  
  hands on him makes the sensations so much more intense. 

  “Bloody — 
  
    fucking 
  
  hell, Granger,” he practically chokes out. 

  He tightens his fingers in her locks, pulls her up and smashes their lips together. It’s a desperate kiss, fucking needs her lips between his teeth. 

  There are times when this 
  
    need 
  
  comes over him. The sort of feeling where he can’t think if he isn’t touching her in some way. Those lips are always the remedy. 

  And as he practically devours her crimson lips, his other hand slithers in between them, between her breasts and towards home — her cunt. It’d be considered his, she does belong to him after all. 

  Her lips are soft against his but more demanding as ever. She stopped asking for entrance a while ago, forcefully parts his lips and fucks him with her tongue. Her soft and skillful tongue that he just loves so much, makes him feel things he has never felt before. 

  She is one of a kind, he doesn’t doubt it. And he is so lucky to be able to have her like this, be able to have all of these sensations that only she causes. 

  His fingers graze her slit, feeling her trimmed curls tickle him. She moans into his mouth and he swallows every vibration. Her hips move in search for more pressure, more of that delicious feeling only he seems to be able to give her. 

  One of her hands tangles in his fringe. She tightens her grip to assume control and tilts his head up, deepens the kiss. And everytime she does that, he can’t help but groan into her pretty mouth. 

  His fingers enter her cunt. She’s fucking drenched, warm, and the fact that he wants to watch her fuck herself on his thigh is the only thing prenventing him from throwing her on her back and devouring her cunt. 

  She breaks their kiss — her lips are red, swollen, and in need of being between his teeth again. He fucking wants to bite her lips and suck on the blood from the broken skin — and releases a quaking moan. 

  Her hips begin to move on their own accord, once again. This time he stills her with just one of his hands. He is the one in control, is the one who decides just how much pleasure she’ll get. 

  “I think you’ve forgotten your place, hmm?” He slowly moves his fingers, so gradual he can see the struggle in her eyes. 

  “I — I’ll be good.” She bites her lip and moves to kiss him. She strokes her fingers through his locks and begins to fuck herself on his fingers at a quick pace. It isn’t long before moans drip from her tongue. 

  And all he can do is chuckle. It’s a knowing chuckle. She really thinks she can outsnake him. It’s truly laughable. 

  He feels her hips stutter and takes that as an opportunity to grip her hips harshly and stop her movements completely. 

  “Lions will never be as sly as snakes, baby, and it’s about time you realize that.” He looks her in the eyes, a brow cocked, waiting to hear what she says. 

  “What?” Her chocolate brows are furrowed. “Draco —”

  He pushes her hips downward as if to sit. And she does but his fingers go deeper inside of her and he hears the whine from her throat. 

  “Trying to distract me, yeah? Trying to avoid getting punished.” He tilts his head to the side, practically taunts her. “Tell me you’ll be good but then completely contradict yourself.” He slightly shakes his head. “The Brightest Witch of Her Age isn’t as sly as she thought.”

  He watches her carefully. She has been caught and he waits for her response because it’ll dictate whether she gets punished or not. But he won’t tell her that. 

  “Draco, I just want to make you feel good on your birthday. I don’t want to be punished and I — let me show you how good I can be.” She doesn’t move, only begs him, and waits for his answer. 

  This is the way she should've begged him in the beginning. But he won’t deny how fucking sexy she looked before he had caught her.

  “I don’t think you deserve a second chance.” His fingers soften at her hip and slowly begin to trail up her spine. “Do you?” His eyes were stuck where his fingers were buried in her cunt but he forced his eyes to meet hers. 

  She shivers once his fingers reach her nape and wraps them there. She looks to his shoulder but he doubts she’s doing much thinking, his fingers are deep inside of her. 

  “No,” she murmurs, fingers untangle themselves from his locks and rest on his nape. “But I 
  
    can 
  
  be good. You know I can.” Her gaze reluctantly meets his and she leans in and places a kiss on his lips. “I’d do anything for you, Draco Malfoy.” It’s a low whisper. Like she doesn’t want anyone else to hear it because this moment is only for them. 

  And maybe they’re only speaking about getting punished and what not but what she said feels like it has a double meaning. 

  She’d do anything for him. 

  His chest feels weird again. It’s like there are these flutters, like butterflies have infested his chest cavity. That is such a muggle reference but it’s the only way he can think to describe how the words Hermione Granger uttered to him make him feel. 

  He brings his hand to cup her cheek, glides his finger across her cheekbone. It’s a touch of adoration. 

  There’s a smile on his lips.

  He pulls her in for another soft kiss. 

  They separate and just gaze at each other. 

  Until…

  He curls the fingers inside of her, touches that spot that makes her go absolutely feral. And she rolls her eyes back and involuntarily moans. It’s a loud and guttural one. 

  He could tell she didn’t expect it and it’s why he did it to begin with. Surprise on her is a pretty look, almost as pretty as she looks when she’s aroused. 

  He tangles his hand in her curls and directs her gaze to his, placing their foreheads together. He feels her breath on his face and watches as her chest rises and falls rapidly. She’s panting. 

  Slowly, he pumps his fingers twice more and takes them out of her. The warmth leaves his fingers and for a moment he wants to put them back in her precious cunt. 

  But he doesn’t. Instead, he slowly brings his fingers up and gently pushes her head back to make space in between their faces. 

  Once he’s sure her eyes are glued onto his lips, he moves his fingers to his mouth and tastes her. 

  And gods, if it wasn’t like pure heaven. 

  He’ll never be able to describe how she tastes but it’s nothing short of absolutely delicious. 

  She watches him closely, blood rushing to all parts of her skin, mouth watering and cunt getting impossibly wetter. 

  He passes his tongue through every crevice of his fingers, licking every single drop off of him, sucking for extra measure. 

  His eyes never leave hers and it makes it all the more exhilarating watching her get so hot from watching him slurp. 

  But the thing that intrigues him the most is how her eyes track the movement of his tongue. It glides and flicks showing her the things he’ll be doing to her cunt later on. 

  “You fucking taste,” he leans in closer, lips touching hers and nose grazing too, “like,” he pecks her lips and tightens his grip on locks, “what I’d imagine heaven feels like. You’re so fucking addicting. The taste of you.” 

  He guesses she couldn’t handle it because she crushes her lips on his, making their teeth clank together. It was hard and full of need, she was needy and probably on the verge of over-heating. 

  His lips return with much more fervor because he needs her and if he wasn’t to hellbent on fucking teasing her, he would’ve taken her on the chaise a while ago. 

  Then he parts them once again, panting in her face as she does the same and says, “You were honest before, and I’ll always reward your honesty.” She smiles despite her heavy breathing. “But don’t try and trick me again, baby, because I’ll punish you and I won’t care for your begging.”

  She knows how he means it, sexually. When he’s in control, he’ll be lenient with her unless she pushes his buttons.

  “No, it won’t have to come to that, Draco. I promise.” She looks at him through her lashes and it does something to him. 

  She has the power to destroy him, has him on her palm, has him wrapped around her fingers. You could use any fucking metaphor to describe how besotted he is with her and it’d be accurate. 

  It has only ever happened once before. She’d pushed and pushed until he snapped. He’d edged her all night, spanked her until her arse cheeks were red and raw, and didn’t let her come until two days afterwards. 

  Without letting her get another word in, he grabbed her hips and roughly ground her cunt on his thigh, further wetting his already soaked trousers. 

  The gasp that comes out of her lips is quick and breathless followed by a moan. She shut her eyes and dug her nails onto his shoulders. 

  Her cunt is so sensitive he couldn’t find it in himself to not tease her relentlessly. 

  Teasing is his favorite thing. The foreplay is what makes the sex intense and so enjoyable. The teasing leaves your nerves alight and sensitive to any touch. 

  She’s breathless. Always so fucking breathless for him. He’ll never let her catch a break, especially when she looks so beautiful like this for him. 

  He leans into her parted lips and traces his tongue along her lips. Tasting her and feeling her breath come upon his face. 

  It isn’t exactly kissing, merely him licking those pretty lips, sucking and making them even more scarlet than they already are. 

  He never lets more space between them, maintains their proximity and says, “Fuck yourself on my thigh. Enjoy yourself, touch yourself and let me hear you.” His voice is dark and predatory. 

  This is when he physically sees her pupils take over her iris. There’s no trace of sweet chocolate but only animalistic need and he just knows he mirrors her. 

  She places her hands on his shoulders and places his on her hips. Despite the arousal clouding her every bit, he could see her nerves. It’s the first time she does this and probably doesn’t know how to act. 

  He gives her a reassuring nod as he begins to rock her hips slowly against his wet trousers. The wetness seeps through and touches his skin. It’s warm and slick and he finds the sensation to be just about the best thing he has ever felt. 

  She shudders a breath at the first pull. And again when he pushes. It only enables him more as he rocks her harder but never changes his pace. 

  Push and pull, push and pull, push and pull. 

  It’s slow and a way to start her off. Though the chorus of moans that slips past her tongue makes it increasingly difficult to not move her faster. 

  Her nails dig into the fabric, bunching up the material as her cunt rubs against his thigh. Before she’d taken to bunching up his shirt, she’d dug her nails into his shoulders. 

  And everytime she leaves marks on him, he can’t help but feel giddy. She marks him as hers and just the thought of that is enough to make him feral. 

  Just like that she’s moving on her own, faster. 

  “There you go.” He smirks proudly as his witch. “Just like that.”

  He sits back and admires the view. Her tits bounce with every back and forth movement. She’s panting and moaning and it’s so loud and so fucking perfect. 

  Her curls bounce with her, curls sticking to her already sweaty temples and neck. Her hands tangle in her locks, as her moans grow louder and hip pace goes erratic. 

  Her chest goes in and out rapidly causing her bra to slip off revealing a brown nipple. And gods he wants to see her cum in that pretty green fabric but he just can’t resist her perfect tits. 

  He grabs the middle of her bra and rips the material off her chest, marveling at the greatness that are Hermione Granger’s tits. 

  She puffs out a laugh, throwing her head back and groaning so loud he thinks his neighbors heard her. Good, they should know how good his witch is getting fucked at this moment. 

  He’s out of breath, the arousal in itself exerting him, yet he wraps his hot lips around her left nipple. His hands slither to her lower back, just staying there as he ravages her nipple. 

  “
  
    Fuck. Draco, gods, fuck. Bite.” 
  
  She screams as her fingers come to tangle in sweaty fringe. Her head is still thrown back and she moans up to the gods. 

  And he does so, nibbling and sucking as her hips move at a pace he can’t even fathom. His nails dig into the small of her back. 

  This right here is the source of his euphoria. Her pleasure, happiness, everything.

  He moves a hand to her right tit, kneading it roughly. It fits perfectly in his palm and he just wants to devour it. 

  She tugs at his hair, pulling him up and crashing her lips onto his. It’s rough and both of them are out of breath so it’s a mess of panting and needing each other’s lips. 

  Moans, groans, and gasps leave her lips and go into his. He swallows them with primal need, needing her noises and chants. 

  She breaks the kiss and leaves him wanting more but he just goes on to give attention to her right nipple. Licking it like a lolly and nibbling. He knows she loves this, knows he’s the only one to ever give this to her and it sends delight coursing through his veins. 

  He kneads the left breast just as roughly as he leaves bite marks and bruises on her chest and neck. Marking her is probably his favorite part of having sex with her because she belongs to him and only him. 

  
    Mine. 
  

  
    Mine to keep. 
  

  Her grip on his locks is fucking painful and it only tightens as she comes closer to finishing. It’s to the point where he thinks she’ll rip his hair off but he can’t complain, not when this all feels so fucking good. 

  He leans on his back, admiring all marks on her chest and neck. They only enhance her beauty and his possessiveness over her. 

  He’ll never get over how beautiful she is, will never get over the fact that she’s his. She’d established it with that pendant. 

  Crimson is painted on her cheeks and neck. He trails his fingers from her lower belly to the valley between her tits and resting on her neck, squeezing gently. 

  He forces her to look him in the eyes, and she does, but she never stops fucking his thigh. She probably couldn’t stop even if he told her to, it feels too good to stop now. 

  He waits a couple of seconds, waiting until the perfect time, until he knows she’s about to come. Torturing her is his goal and he’s about to overachieve it. 

  “Don’t cum. Not until I tell you to.” He squeezes her throat harder but it isn’t too much. “You’re gonna be a good girl and 
  
    wait.
  
  ”

  “Draco… no, baby, 
  
    fuck.” 
  
  She couldn’t speak, only incoherent babbles of words slipping from her mouth, but she pulled at his fringe harder. “Please, I'm about to. I — I’m so close… 
  
    so close just please.
  
  ”

  A wicked smirk etches on his lips as he releases her neck from his grip, lowering his fingers to his belt and twirling a finger around the buckle. Her eyes find his tantalizing fingers. 

  “You’re going to hold it, baby. You know what those consequences will be.” Spanking, choking, edging, roughness, and a paddle engraved with her name awaits her if she cums. 

  She whines, loud and desperate. That’s just how he likes her; begging for him like he’s the only one that’ll ever be able to make her cum, like he’s the only one that can make her feel this fucking good. 

  He begins to unbuckle his belt, slowly, watching her every move and listening to the music that is her whines and moans. 

  “Baby… baby, 
  
    please.
  
  ” She throws her head back 
  
    screaming. 
  
  “I can’t — I can’t do this. 
  
    Please.
  
  ” 

  “
  
    Hold it. Hold it, Granger
  
  ,” he says severely. 

  He pulls his zipper down, opening it wide and pulling out his hard cock. It’s achingly hard. He doesn’t know how he was able to hold on for so long. 

  
    Fuck. 
  

  
    I need her. 
  

  He lifts his hand to her lips, dragging the bottom lip roughly, moans never stopping. “Spit on my cock, baby.” He smirks. “Please,” he purrs. 

  “You’re killing me, Malfoy.” She slows her pace. 

  “Be good for me.”

  Then she lowers her head, spitting on the middle of his shaft. She looks up at him and he wipes her lip. “Good?”

  “Perfect. Always so perfect for me.” He smiles up at her and strokes the pendant with his initials. “Go on then, continue fucking yourself with my thigh. You look so beautiful.” 

  She begins to move, losing herself to him once more. And he begins to stroke his cock as he drinks her in. 

  Her spit makes it easier, making his cock slippery. 

  He knows he’ll cum fast and that’s a good thing. She won’t have to wait any longer than she needs to. 

  His eyes flit to her bouncing tits — glorious fucking tits — and up to her face where her cheeks are crimson and mouth agape, panting up to the gods. 

  He tightens his grip on his cock, letting a moan escape past his tongue and rewarding her. He pumps rapidly, and as fast as he goes the less he can catch his breath.

  
    Fuck. 
  

  Her pendant moves with her, shimmering with the light of the moon. His initials have never looked better on someone. 

  As he goes to cup his balls, he feels another hand atop of his, guiding his hand up and down his cock. It’s tighter and so much more than he can ever think to handle. He’s fighting for his life, breathing is a chore. 

  “Draco… 
  
    I can’t. Please let me cum.
  
  ”

  He groans, but he didn’t intend on letting it go. He didn’t want to give her that satisfaction. “Yes, princess, I know, know… but you’ve got to wait.” He can see the tears of frustration starting to blur her vision. “But you will wait, isn’t that right?”

  She clenches her jaw, never stopping her pace on his thigh, knowing damn well he’d edge her for stopping completely. She nods, letting a stream of curses leave her lip as he starts vibrating his thigh against her cunt. 

  He smirks, loving the control he has. 

  He continues fucking his hand when his eyes travel down to where her cunt meets his clothed thigh. He focuses on how it feels — the wetness, the rubbing, the hand helping him stroke himself. 

  As he softly massages his balls, she glides her finger along the tip, causing him to gasp a breath. It was hard and unexpected and sent tingles all over his legs. 

  He feels it building up, knows it’s coming and it’s only a matter of time before they both jump off that cliff. They’ll fall and fall and it’ll be fucking heavenly. 

  And just as he is about to finish, he says, “Come for me, baby. Cum on my thigh like a good girl.”

  She does, cumming so hard her voice breaks with all the screaming she does. He physically feels it, feeling how 
  
    much 
  
  it is and feeling more of his trousers get wet. 

  He’s also cumming, cumming on her thigh and painting her white. It gets on her barely there knickers. 

  They’re panting like never before, it’s so fucking hard to even catch a breath when something this intense has just happened. Their faces are a deep red and sweat glistens on their skin. 

  Before he even catches his breath, he’s gliding two fingers over her thigh, getting as much of his cum as he possibly can on his fingers. 

  He examines it for just a second before he grabs her neck in his palm, squeezing just enough to make her gasp, and making her watch as he shoves his fingers into his mouth, sucking every last bit of cum. 

  And she watches, enchanted by it. Her cheeks get impossibly darker and her pupils begin to dilate again. It’s exhilarating watching her like this. 

  He doesn’t swallow. He strokes her cheek, feeling the warmth of them. Her eyes flit towards his mouth and throat and he knows what she's waiting for but he isn’t going to swallow. 

  He smirks at her, shoving his thumb into her mouth and forcing it open. Her tongue swirls around his finger like it does around the tip of his cock like it’s second-nature and he could feel himself getting hard again. 

  He’s spitting into her mouth, putting his cum onto her tongue. The contrast of pink and white is beautiful. He wipes the little bit falling down from her lips and brings his tongue to her skin to wipe it off. 

  She’s shocked he did this, hadn’t expected it. But she’s satisfied nonetheless. And the smile on her face is incredibly devious. 

  “Swallow. 
  
    Now.
  
  ”

  She does, showing him evidence that she’d swallowed every last drop. There was no resistance, just unadulterated willingness. 

  “That’s my good girl.” He leans in to press a kiss against her lips. “Such a pretty girl. You’re so good for me.”

  As if their momentary energy dissipates, she falls on him, practically boneless after that intense orgasm. She clings into him, panting into his neck as he throws his head back and pants up to the gods, holding her against him tightly. 

  He can’t even think to move at the moment. His bones feel like jelly and feels like sand when he tries to move. And his breathing isn’t any better, because Granger’s too sexy. She makes him turn into a puddle of nothing with just a simple smile. 

  And as their breathing evens out, he feels her shift against him, lifting her head up to look at him. Her face is a light shade of pink and there’s a smile so bright it blinds him. 

  “Was that too much for you or can you take another?” His voice is devious and challenging because he knows she’ll never back down; it isn’t in her nature. 

  He could see it in the glint in her chocolate irises and in the way she pulls her lip between her teeth. “I can take as much as you give me.” She places her hand on the side of his neck. “Go on then, Malfoy, do your worst.”

  He smirks and it has nothing but pure evilness. He grabs her arse and secures her around his waist, and begins to walk towards the bedroom. 

  He throws her on the bed and begins stripping his clothes off. He’s quick with it, not wanting to waste any time because the teasing has already been done and he doesn’t think he can wait any longer to take his witch. 

  Climbing onto the bed, he prowls towards her. He grabs her roughly, flipping her into her stomach and moving her curls off of her back and away from her face. 

  “You’re gonna get fucked within an inch of your life, Granger. Do you think you can take that? Hm?” His voice is predatory; it switches at times when he’s so fucking needy, he’s animalistic. 

  “Do your worst.”

  He lifts her hips up, arse up in the air, and massages her arse cheeks, feeling the soft flesh he’s about to bruise. He leans into her back, rubbing his cock against her arse cheeks and placing kisses on the space between her shoulder blades. He traces his tongue against the freckles on her back as he always does when they have sex. 

  Her hips push against him, making him breath out heavily. It feels good, too good. 
  
    Fuck. 
  

  He lifts himself up, smacking his palm roughly against her arse cheek. It leaves his hand tingling so he can only imagine how it feels for her. 

  This isn’t about what she wants or needs, it’s about him taking what he wants when he wants to. This is to comply with him, he’s merely using her for his pleasure, and she just loves that he’s doing that. 

  She moans against the satin sheets, gripping them like her life depended on it. It shouldn’t have been this intense of a reaction but she’s reaching for the minimum; if there’s any little ounce of pleasure she’ll take it like it’s the rarest thing in the world in this state. 

  “Don’t take more than I give you, baby.” He traces her spine, watching as she arches into him. 

  “Draco…” She lifts her arse higher for him and fuck he just wants to leave bite marks all over it. “Please.” He knows she’s begging for another spank, knows that she fucking adores it, but tonight she doesn’t get to get what she wants. 

  He parts her thighs impossibly wide and settles between them, teasing the tip of his cock against her wet cunt, relishing in the beautiful tickles of pleasure that encroach his nerves. 

  She whines against the sheets, bucking her hips and moving to meet his hips. 

  He grabs her hips roughly and sheathes his cock inside of her, fast and without any warning. He throws his head back, groaning deeply, as she yells her voice raw. 

  Tangling his fingers tightly in her fringe, he pulls her up against his front, watching her cling onto him for support. She’d gasped because she was surprised when he pulled her up but it was interrupted by a groan, knowing that she loves having her hair pulled, knows it makes her go feral. 

  He lays her head over his shoulder, wrapping his hand around her neck to keep her in place, listening to her breathing quickly.

  His nose nuzzles against her cheek, as his fingertips trail around her chest and into the valley between her tits, lightly teasing her nipples. 

  “I’ll never get over how beautiful you are. I mean look at you.” He takes a nipple between his fingers and pinches, hearing her breathily moan for him. 

  He watches her reactions. Catching how she bites her lips and how she wraps her hand around the wrist holding her neck, digging her nails into him. 

  His fingers find their own way around her belly, tickling and teasing as they travel lower, where his destination is. 

  “I'm going to destroy you. Will you let me, Granger?”

  “Yes,” she breathes, tilting her head to look up at him. “I’ll let you do as you please. Have your way with me, Draco.”

  He smirks sinisterly, watching closely to see how her face contorts as his fingers graze her sensitive clit, tightening his hand around her throat. 

  It isn’t much what his fingers do because the real pleasure will be given to her from his cock. The cock she loves and praises so damn much. The cock she begs him to suck at least once a day. 

  He releases her, pushing her roughly onto all fours and pressing his hand into the space between her shoulders. And she clenches around his cock, looking back at him. 

  His hand harshly meets her arse cheek once more, and she moans deeply. 

  “Try something with me again and I’ll get the paddle.”

  “What if I want you to?”

  “Oh, baby, you don’t.”

  He begins a slow and steady pace, relishing in the deliciousness that is her slick cunt and pretty moans. Being inside of her will never be tiring. It’ll never feel anything short of extraordinary. 

  He breathes short breaths, digging his nails into her hips and feeling the sweat form in his neck and temples. 

  That calm pace doesn’t last very long because he pistons into her five minutes later, not being able to take the fucking teasing himself, but she took is like a good girl. 

  He shoves his hand harder against her back, pushing her into the bed. He takes her wrists in his hands and holds them behind her back. 

  The only noise that can be heard is the bed hitting the wall over and over again, matching his thrusts, and their pleasurable moans as they lose themselves in each other. 

  He summons his belt and begins wrapping it around her wrists, like she’s at his mercy. She 
  
    is 
  
  at his mercy. The very mercy that he won’t be so lenient in giving tonight. 

  “Dr —- Draco… what, what are you — 
  
    fuck, oh, fuck. Right… right there. Mhm, baby, don’t stop.
  
  ” 

  He chuckles darkly, making sure the belt is on nice and tight, feeling pride flood his veins because of his ability to make her stop her little sentence. 

  If she’s able to even think a sentence while he’s fucking her, then he isn’t doing a very good job at making her feel impossibly good, at destroying her. 

  “What was that, baby? I couldn’t quite catch what you were saying?” he teases, never stopping his hips from moving in and out. 

  She only sputters and it’s one of the only noises he should be hearing. 

  He teases that collection of nerves once more, loving as she spasms and withers beneath him, wrists fighting against the restraints as he teases her relentlessly. 

  It’s fun watching her be like this for him, watching her be so desperate and needy for him she just doesn’t know what to do with herself. 

  He tangles his fingers in her curls and lifts her head up partially, enough for her to be able to breathe and speak. But he never stops slamming his cock inside of her, never stops his own noises and never stops his hips from clashing with the soft flesh of her arse. 

  “Was there something you needed to tell me, baby?” It’s difficult to speak, difficult to even think when she feels this good, when she’s doing so well, when she’s being such a good girl he can’t think of anything but how he wants to tell her. 

  “Please, 
  
    please, don’t stop.
  
  ” Those are the only words that leave her lips and he knows that wasn’t what she was going to say but he’ll leave it alone for both of their sakes. 

  She meets his thrusts, arse hitting his hips and lower stomach and it does something to him, emits this sort of concentrated nerves into his cock. 

  He’s about to cum. 

  He stops his movements all together, hearing her cry out in protest, as he unties the belt and flips her onto her back. 

  Her face is deeply flushed and her chest rises and falls so quickly. Her hands run over her body, over her breasts and neck, feeling the sweat. 

  He enters her once more, giving them both what they need, still feeling his impending orgasm. It’s like a breath of fresh air. 

  Like it’s second nature, she tightly wraps her legs around his waist and wraps her arms around his neck despite them being jelly like, because he just knows they are, and pulls him closer to her, skin-to-skin. 

  His hips move frantically and she meets his unearthly thrusts with equal fervor, gasping and breathing out with each one. 

  It’s a beautiful thing, really. The magic they make together, and the passion that burns within each of them for each other. It’s like electricity. 

  She scorches him with her touch and groans, showing him how good he’s making her feel and it only enables him more. 

  His forehead rests on hers, lips moving as frantic as their hips. 

  The bed frame slams so hard against the wall he’s sure it’ll collapse by the end of this but his hips just can’t stop, not when they’re so close, not when it feels this good.

  His fingers make their way between them, though it’s difficult, and reaches for her clit, rubbing slowly in circular motions. 

  “Draco, 
  
    Draco, fuck just like that.
  
  ” She flutters around his cock, making his control slip further. 

  “You’re going to cum so hard for me, baby. You’re going to shatter underneath me.”

  And as if he predicted it, she cums, thrashing and yelling her already sore throat, clinging onto him like he’s a rope holding her from falling off a cliff, and digging her nails nearly painfully into his skin. 

  He watches her face, the way it contorts and admires how beautiful she looks cuming on his cock, how beautiful she looks cuming underneath him. 

  Somehow she isn’t as jelly as he’d thought she’d be, because she grabs his face and kisses him harshly, shoving her tongue in hue mouth and fucking him the he fucked her cunt. 

  His hips still move but less so but he can feel his orgasm just there on the brink, waiting for him to give himself the release. 

  But he needs something… needs to 
  
    hear 
  
  something. 

  In between lips and shared breaths she says, “Come for me. Come inside of me. 
  
    Please, baby.
  
  ” There it is. 

  It’s like the gates of heaven opened right in his face, white light blinding him. He groans deep and exhausted, and his legs shake with the intensity of it all. 

  He came too hard. It isn't bearable. The pleasure feels so fucking good he can’t even describe it, can’t even fathom words to say or fathom an actual emotion that isn’t pure bliss. 

  Slowly but surely their high dissipates, leaving them boneless and an utter mess. 

  He lays atop her but is able to push himself off when he musters enough strength in his arms, taking her in his arms and pulling her up with him. 

  She lays on his chest, wrapped in his arms, breathing slowly and calmly, and he does the same. Both of them were too shocked at how truly good this was. 

  “You’ve destroyed me.”

  December 24, 2005

  When was the last time he had a pleasant Christmas? Did he ever? 

  Sure, he got dozens of presents as a child, but that never took away the feeling of abandonment. 

  Mother was there at times, held him when she could and got so excited as she watched him open his presents. But she was rarely around through most of the day. Not because she chose so but because of Lucius. 

  So, when he first started at Hogwarts, he stayed in for the holidays while most children went home to loving and caring families. 

  It eased the feelings of abandonment, but it never truly cured it. 

  A kid shouldn’t have to feel like that, parents shouldn’t have fucking kids if that can’t care for them the way they need. And in moments of weakness, he’d wished his parents had been fair and never conceived him. 

  He’d been born into a life meant only for pain. 

  There was only so much a boy could take. 

  And every year, he stayed in school. Every year after, he’d spent it in seclusion, in his flat, drinking until he passed out. 

  It was pathetic and sick and something everyone wished on him. 

  But this year… this year is different. 

  She’s spending Christmas with him. 

  But she’s been invited to Potter’s Christmas get-together. Because apparently, there has to be some sort of celebration for fucking everything. 

  
    “Are you going?” He swallows visibly, nervous that she’d choose her friends over him. She’d have every right to but it wouldn’t stop him from feeling hurt. 
  

  
    She didn’t look up from the letter. Her eyes flit from left to right rereading the sloppy words written by Harry Potter. Her jaw clenched and her fingers fiddled with the edges of the parchment. 
  

  
    His nerves grew as the silence stretched on. He over thought, and every one of the insecurities he’d buried rose up and crashed on him all together in full force. It was like being bombarded with dozens of spells at a time. 
  

  
    Several lengthy minutes had passed before she had moved her gaze onto his. It seemed as if it pained her to have to meet his eyes.
  

  
    Then he caught the expression on her face and it made a knot form in his throat. Her lips were chewed up and raw but she continued to bite on them as if they weren’t, her brows were furrowed and her eyes held a sparkle of something he didn’t quite know meant. 
  

  
    “I think I should.” She met his eyes with her face and shoulders set.
  

  
    It seemed like she had already made up her mind, so he didn’t question it, just nodded numbly as he bit his lip so hard he broke the skin. 
  

  
    Then he walked to get a glass of water, hoping it would relieve the aching feeling in his chest. 
  

  
    As he began to walk away from her, she called for him. But he ignored her and continued to get the water. He sat on the couch and just sipped at it. 
  

  
    His eyes burned and it was fucking ridiculous. A fucking grown man getting emotional because his girlfriend was not going to spend Christmas with him. 
  

  
    But it just happened. It hurt. He didn’t want to be alone again, not after all these years of being with her he didn’t think he’d ever have to spend another Christmas alone. 
  

  
    His vision swam. Fucking child. 
  

  
    He summoned a book because maybe reading would make this shit go away, maybe it’d save him the embarrassment. 
  

  
    And as if he wasn’t struggling already, she’d sat down next to him, gaze never left him and his horrid state. 
  

  
    She had placed her hand on his thigh and another on the space between his shoulder and neck, squeezed on both and he couldn’t move his eyes to anywhere but the book in his fingers. 
  

  
    He placed the glass on the coffee table and continued looking at the words he wasn’t processing. 
  

  
    “Draco…” Her voice was pleading and it only made him clench his eyes shut. “Baby.” Her hands traveled to his face to cup his cheeks. 
  

  
    His heart clenched when she’d called him that. 
  

  
    She tried to make him face her but he wouldn’t let her, did anything he could to ensure she didn’t know he wasn’t at the point of crying. 
  

  
    When she’d seen he wasn’t going to budge, she dropped her hands to his shoulders, ripped the book from his fingers and climbed onto his lap. 
  

  
    She’d grabbed his face and forced him to look at her. Her eyes flitted between his and he wished the tears away, wished for Merlin to do this one thing for him. 
  

  
    Draco?” Her voice was soft. “Baby, don’t be upset. I just want to see them, you know? They’re my family even if they haven’t treated me all that well.”
  

  
    It was hard and took courage he didn’t fucking have, but he met her eyes and saw how raw and genuine she was. He clenched his jaw. 
  

  
    “Listen, I 
  
  
    promise
  
  
     I’ll make sure you aren’t bored or feel left out. I won’t leave your side and I won’t let them say anything rude to you.” 
  

  
    “You want me to go?”
  

  
    “Of course I want you to go.” Her eyes were wide with shock. “Baby, I assumed you’d come with me.”
  

  
    “You didn’t ask nor mention my going to his house.” His heart hammered in his chest with relief and utter admiration for the witch in his lap. 
  

  
    Her eyes soften. “I wouldn’t ever choose spending Christmas with them over spending it with you. I’d never leave you to spend it all alone.” Her thumb strokes his cheekbone and it soothes the tension that plagued his shoulders. 
  

  
    It’s with that sentence that his heart had done a somersault. Her words did so much more to him that he cared to admit. They held a power over him that wasn’t normal. 
  

  
    He didn’t find it himself to care. 
  

  
    She leaned close to his face, ghosted her breath against his lashes, and placed a kiss on his forehead. 
  

  
    She lingered there for a few seconds and while she did so he found his voice and said, “I just didn’t want to spend another Christmas alone.” It was a soft whisper that contained vulnerability. He felt he could be vulnerable with her, felt he could trust her. 
  

  And so now he stands at the foot of Potter’s door. It’s cold and his coat isn’t doing it’s job in keeping him warm. She doesn’t seem to care because her mind is elsewhere. 

  It’s irritating and he wishes she would’ve chosen to just stay with him, spend the day in his arms with their limbs tangled together, give lazy kisses and dreamy smiles. 

  He distracts himself by looking at her. 

  She’s wonderful and perfect and beautiful and he couldn’t ask for more in a witch. It amazes him how he managed to get a hold of a witch like Hermione Granger. 

  All he knows is that he’s thankful. Thankful for Potter and his forgiving self, thankful for those stupid celebrations, thankful for having secluded himself because if he hadn’t, he wouldn’t have had all those encounters with her, and everything that happened in between. 

  He’s even thankful for Weasley and his inability to treat a witch the way she deserves. He’s so fucking incompetent that he’d driven his girlfriend —
  
     ex now — 
  
  to the person that bullied him relentlessly. To say it’s beyond hilarious is an understatement. 

  And gods did he want to see Weasley’s face when he sees that Hermione Granger belongs to Draco Malfoy, and there isn’t a thing he could do to change it. 

  Granger. He’s so thankful that Granger had found it in herself to forgive him for every hurtful thing he’d ever said and done. He could lay a thousand reasons as to why he’ll never deserve her or her forgiveness, he’ll never deserve anything she gives or says to him. He doesn’t even deserve a moment of her time. 

  But she gives it to him either way and he’ll make every second count. He’ll make it worth her time. 

  She’s it for him. 

  She’s it for him in the sense in which she completes him. She’s his other half. And he’ll stay with her for as long as she’ll have him. He just hopes she has the same intentions as him, because he doesn’t want to ever have to let go of her. 

  “… Draco!” She smacks his chest lightly and it interrupts his wandering thoughts. She’s breathing heavily and he could tell she’s nervous. 

  “
  
    Yes, 
  
  baby?” 

  “Are you even listening? Gods, this is gonna be fucking —“ She begins pacing, biting her lip raw and thumbing the thread on her jumper, head shaking and mumbled nonsense slipping past her lips. 

  “I don’t get why you’re so nervous. You’ve known these people for decades.” He breathes out, a breath made evident by the cold. “I’m sure this isn’t the first Christmas you’ve spent with them. Why are you having a freak out?”

  She still continues to pace as if he has said nothing, though her mumbling turns furious so he knows she’s upset now. 

  “Granger…”

  She doesn’t listen to him and so he walks towards her and interrupts her pacing, grabbing her by the shoulders and physically stopping her. He squeezes her as if to ground her in a way and he thinks it works. 

  He moves his hands to cup her face and bores his eyes in hers. There’s a glint of nerves evident in her chocolate irises. 

  “Breathe.” He takes in a breath so she could mimic. “Everything is going to be just fine.” Another breath, and another. 

  They continue this until her breathing is even and calm. 

  He strokes her cheek and she holds onto his wrists, squeezing ever so often, and her eyes never leaving his. Her eyes flit to all parts of his face, remembering what she already had memorized. 

  She’d told him that’s what she does when the nerves begin to be too much to handle.

  He leans in to kiss her, chapped lips but soft and comforting nonetheless. She lifts herself on her tip-toes and meets him in the middle. 

  They kiss slowly, savouring it because in just a few minutes they’ll have to go in. He licks her bottom lip and she parts her lips to let him in, tongues dancing in the way that makes his knees week. 

  She nips at his bottom lip but not hard enough to draw blood and glides her tongue along it to soothe him. 

  A feeling of nostalgia hits him. They’d snogged and fought and nearly fucked on this very porch. The thought makes him laugh into her pretty mouth. 

  “What?” she says against his lips though she never stops moving hers against his, hands leaving his wrists and trailing down to wrap her arms around his waist. 

  He pulls her closer, tighter if possible, and tangles a hand in her beautiful curls. “Nothing, baby.”

  She kisses him harder, tongue flicking against the roof of his mouth, pulling him harder against her. 

  And as quickly as their snogging started, he forced himself to pull away from the comfort of her arms. Both out of breath and wanting more of each other. 

  “Wait, wait,” she whines, pulling him in for another kiss. This time her hands trail lower to his arse, squeezing and cupping him. 

  He breathes a laugh at her groping. “Granger, we need to go in.” She only kisses him. “The sooner… we go in the… faster we can go home.” She interrupts him every couple of words, insatiable. 

  “You have a nice arse.” She kisses once more, squeezing his arse. 

  He opens his eyes and looks at her, a mischievous smirk splitting her lips. He glides his thumb along her swollen lips and places a chaste kiss. 

  “You can touch my arse all you’d like 
  
    later. 
  
  We’ve got to go in now.” She nods in agreement though she didn’t have a choice to begin with. 

  She interlocks their fingers together, squeezing, and they walk in. Granger had told him that Potter has wards around his home so leaving the front door open wasn’t much of a concern. 

  The music isn’t as loud as it usually was but maybe that’s because they’re early. Well, no, not early, just on time. 

  The only people here are Potter, Weaslette, and Luna Lovegood. They’re sitting on the couches and sipping brandy while having an animated conversation.

  But it all comes to a stop once their eyes land on Draco and Granger. And once their eyes travel down to their hand, everyone’s eyes widen like a saucer. He would’ve barked a laugh had it been less awkward. 

  She digs her nails into his hand, leaving painful crescents in their wake. He rubs his thumb over her knuckles hoping it gives her some semblance of comfort. 

  “Well are you just gonna sit there or are you gonna come over here and greet me like a good host, Harry Potter?” she playfully says with a smile he knows is her nervous one. 

  He smirks at them and their confusion. 

  Potter seems to have woken from his daze and got up from his seat next to Weaslette. He offers a meek smile to Granger, followed by a murmured 
  
    Happy Christmas Eve, Mione
  
  , and nods to him. He pulls Granger into a tight hug and rubs her back though she never lets go of his hand. 

  All he gets is a handshake, firm and awkward. “Happy Christmas Eve, Malfoy. Can’t say I expected you to be here especially with Hermione.” Potter’s smile is just the most awkward thing in the world. 

  He attempts a smile but it only comes out tight-lipped, nods his head because just what is he supposed to answer to that?

  “Erm, come sit… we’re just waiting on everyone.” And by everyone he knew Potter meant the Weasel and his new girlfriend. 

  She throws a smile at Weaslette and a murmured 
  
    Hey 
  
  to Lovegood to which they both return the sentiment. 

  She leads him to the couch where Lovegood sits, though he sits on the farthest edge, the corner. Everyone’s eyes follow them and it feels fucking uncomfortable. And she sits right next to him and drops his hand. 

  
    That
  
   upsets him and gives her a look because she isn’t the only one who needs some fucking comfort. He’s just better at hiding his nerves. 

  She smirks at him, having already gotten herself comfortable, and leans in close to press a kiss against his lips. She places her hand on his thigh, 
  
    very 
  
  high on his thigh and he quite enjoys the warmth of it. 

  He smiles at her. 

  “So, Mi’ you and Malfoy?” Weaslette says, breaking the awkward silence. 

  She laughs awkwardly. “Er, yeah, what of it?” She squeezes his thigh. 

  “Quite shocked is all.”

  “I think they make quite the couple,” says Lovegood, throwing a dreamy smile at them both. “I haven’t seen Hermione this happy since… ever.”

  “Oh Luna, we aren’t —“

  “I think I agree with you, Luna,” says Harry, sheepishly smiling. “Er, Malfoy looks like he’s treating her well.”

  A wave of pride engulfs him. He hadn’t thought Potter would be all for them dating, he wouldn’t have given a shit if he wasn’t, but it feels nice. 

  He moves his gaze onto her, finding her brows furrowed and a slight nervous expression etched on her face. Her thumb rubs against his inner thigh though it seems to be more for her than him. 

  He slings his arm over her shoulders, pulling her close against him. 

  She looks up at him, jaw clenching, though she gives him a smile, a weak one but it’s one nonetheless. 

  “What’s up?” he murmurs, only loud enough for her to hear. He brings his hand up to her cheek and strokes, she leans into his palm like it’s second-nature. 

  She breathes out heavily. “Nothing, baby.” She presses a kiss into his lips and turns back to the others. 

  “You wanna know what I think?” Weaslette asks suddenly, a smirk full of mischievousness, rubbing her hands together like some maniac. 

  “Gin —“

  “Ron’s gonna —“

  “Ginny, don’t even mention that wanker,” Granger interrupts, face set and serious. And she has every right to be. 

  “Mi’, he’s coming soon.” Weaslette shrugs. “All I’m saying is that he’s gonna be really pissed that Malfoy’s even here. And I bet he’ll be worse once he finds the both of you snogging and doing all that cute couple shit.” 

  Granger turns a dark shade of crimson, but her face never changes from anything but severe. 

  “I’m just glad I get to see him get all mad like he has any claim on you. He doesn’t even deserve you. I reckon Malfoy’s a better man than he’ll ever be.” She winks at him and she’s growing on him. It’s been maybe ten minutes and he’s already liking her. “He was shitty to you, way shitty than someone like you deserves.”

  “You might just be my favorite redhead,” Draco says, a prideful smirk etched on his lips. 

  “I’m flattered, Ferret, truly.”

  He laughs, really laughs. No one has ever made him laugh besides Granger. There’s something about that redhead. 

  Then he hears the door open, a laugh booming and then suddenly it cuts off. He’s sure the Weasel has just seen his pale blonde hair. The smirk that etches on his lips is fucking huge, could be even a smile. 

  “Ron,” Potter says to break the silence. “Happy Christmas.” It’s weak and it doesn’t do anything to break the loud silence that has engulfed the room. 

  Draco looks back, catching Weasley's eye. His face is red, it’s at the beginning of the red color wheel because Draco is just sure he’ll be purple by the end of the night. 

  “Weasel,” he greets. 

  Granger’s grip on his thigh tightens in warning but he wants to fuck with him just a bit more. He deserves it after all. 

  “What the 
  
    fuck
  
   is the Death Eater doing here?” His voice is loud and obnoxious and full of rage. Draco finds he quite likes that. 

  He stiffens, tensing at those two words that ruined his life, that traumatized him. 

  She looks up to him, bringing her hand to his cheek. “Let me handle this.”

  “No.”

  She didn’t try after that, knowing that he’ll do something either way. 

  “Are all of you just going to sit there and fucking ignore me?” His face has turned a darker shade of red, rage evident in the veins bulging out of his neck. 

  Weaslette sighs, rolling her eyes at her brother’s childish behavior. “What do you think he’s doing here? I mean really Ron, what does one do at a Christmas party? Fucking arsehole.”

  Draco can’t help but laugh; he tried to cover it up because the moment doesn’t call for it but everyone turned their gazes towards him so he knew that they heard him. 

  He hears her breathe out, preparing herself for the explosion that is Ronald Weasley. 

  “Can I kiss you?” she asks. 

  He raises a brow. “You want to because he’ll see.” It shouldn’t hurt him as much as it does. 

  “I want to show him why you’re here. And what better way than a visual?” She smirks, deviously. The pain went away and replaced itself with delight. 

  Weasel’s already walked in and closed the door by the time Draco cups her head and connects their lips. His fingers tangling in her fringe, reveling in the soft curls he gets to have wrapped around his fist and the Weasel doesn’t. 

  She kisses him softly and passionately, slipping her tongue into his mouth softly. Kissing with intensity instead blind need. 

  And as the kiss came to an end, Weasley’s yelling registered in his ears. He’d been in another world while kissing Granger, only paying attention to how her lips move against his. 

  “ — fucking 
  
    disgusting
  
  . Hermione really lowered herself to rubbish. I guess she just loves being called a filthy little mudblood. But she’s just earned another name: 
  
    Death Eater’s Mudblood Whore.
  
  ” He’s scarlet now, veins bulging out of his temples. 

  His body froze, feeling nothing but unadulterated rage for the sorry excuse of a man in front of him. 

  “Ron!” It’s a chorus between Potter and Weaslette. Both angry and disgusted by his choice of words. 

  He looks to Granger, who seems to have 
  
    just 
  
  processed what he’d just said. 

  “Ron, get the 
  
    fuck 
  
  out of my house,” Weaslette bellows, matching her brother’s scarlet face and bulging veins. “You’re disgusting.”

  This is when he blacks out. 

  He doesn’t remember having gotten up from Granger’s side, or the screaming or pulling against him, doesn’t remember the scared look etched on Lovegood’s face, doesn’t remember colliding his fist with Weasel’s jaw, doesn’t remember the crack of the bone, hitting him again and again and again, never remembering the amount of times his fist met Weasley’s face. 

  He only remembers waking up to being held by Potter and Granger. The latter whispering to him, kissing his jaw and pulling towards her as hard as she could.

  
    Baby. 
  

  
    Please calm down. 
  

  
    Let’s go home. 
  

  
    I’ll get you cleaned up. 
  

  
    Draco, please, that’s enough. 
  

  “I’ll kill you,” is all he could say. It’s the only thought running through the wheels in his head. His voice is deadly and it’s a promise. Promise. 

  No one helps the Weasel, everyone knows he doesn’t deserve it. 

  Then he’s pushed back, nearly falling back. Potter didn't let him but also pushed up against a wall, holding him there, afraid of what he’s capable of. 

  Granger’s stomping towards the Weasel, radiating the utter rage dancing along her veins. 

  He can’t breathe or think. The only thought coherent enough for him to decipher is his promise to Weasley. He’ll kill him. 

  He can’t hear what Weaslette is saying though he knows she’s yelling her throat raw. 

  How could Weasley call his best friends, the woman that saved his life countless times, whom he has known for years, call her that disgusting name. That 
  
    slur. 
  

  And maybe he’s a hypocrite because Draco has called her that before, but it’s different. It’s different because it’s Ronald Weasley saying it to Hermione Granger. 

  “Don’t for a second think you get to be upset.” Granger is kneeled down next to Weasley, holding his broken jaw in her hand. It’s painful and Draco reveles in that fact that he’s in pain. “Calling me that word and you think you’re somehow better than him?” She drops his jaw roughly, forcing him to elicit a 
  
    fuck 
  
  of pain. “Call me a whore but you’re the one who has slept with nearly every witch in fucking London.”

  She gets up, shaking her head at that boy she once called her friend, and begins to walk towards Draco. But she stops in her tracks and turns to look at him once more. “Draco will always be a better man. You’re no better than Tom fucking Riddle.”

  With that she begins walking away to Draco. She doesn’t look or say anything to anyone, only stares into his eyes, rage dissipating when looking at him. 

  She takes his hand, making sure to be careful of his bruised knuckles. Her fingers lift to his cheek and strokes him, leaning in to press a kiss onto his lips. Her eyes stay on his after she breaks the kiss, and it makes him more aware of his surroundings. 

  “Harry, we’re gonna go. I’ll drop by tomorrow and leave the gifts.” Her voice is soft and quiet, but loud enough for Potter to hear. 

  With that she takes his hand and leads him out of the house. 

  His gaze doesn't leave the back of her head, long chocolate curls. Though it does stray to Weaslette and she gives him a weak smile, apologizing for her idiot brother. 

  As they make their way, Weasley is still on the floor, groaning in pain and laying on it like he’s dying. Draco doesn’t move his path, stepping on his face and hearing another crunch and a shouted 
  
    fuck. 
  

  That feels good, stepping on a person who’s like shit on the bottom of his shoe. He’ll have to clean it later but for now he’ll relish in the sweet satisfaction coursing through him. 

  Granger doesn’t look back, knowing he would do that. 

  It’s quick as they step outside and aparate home. And it’s quiet as she walks him to the chaise. A silence so thick it makes him anxious. Maybe he’d done something wrong. 

  She conjures a cloth and wets it with an 
  
    Aguamenti
  
  , taking his hand in hers and gently brushing the cloth on his bloodied and bruised knuckles. He couldn’t complain because he has been dying to lay one on the weasel, he deserved as much. 

  He gazes at her, examining the way her brows furrow and teeth bite on her raw lip. She doesn’t look up, though, apparently his knuckles are very interesting. 

  “Granger.” It’s quiet and meek because he thinks she’s upset with him. Why? He hasn’t a clue but her mind works in ways he couldn’t dream to understand. 

  She breathes out a sigh and continues cleaning the blood off of his hands. Then she put this strong scented liquid on the other side of the cloth. It meets his skin and it fucking burns. 

  “Blood hell, Granger.” He tries to pull his hand out of her grasp but she keeps her grip firm. “That 
  
    hurts
  
  .” 

  “Malfoy, shut up.” 

  “Have I done something to upset you? If it’s because of the fight —“

  “I’m not upset.” She looks back down at his hand. “Just hurt, you know?”

  “Why?” Why?

  “It feels pretty shitty when your best friend calls you such a horrid name. 
  
    Death Eater’s Mudblood Whore.
  
  ” She puts the cloth on the coffee table, takes her wand out, pointing it at his knuckles. “It hurts a lot more than it should.” She sniffles. 

  She heals his hand, it’s perfect and back to the way it was; smooth porcelain hands with veins that never seem to not be bulging out. She traces them, it’s her favorite thing to do. 

  He takes her chin in his fingers. “You are none of what he called you. And I am not a Death Eater.” Her eyes begin to fill with tears. “We are far from  perfect but he sure as hell isn’t a saint either. The difference between him and us is that at least we 
  
    try
  
  . He’s a scumbag and a cheat, and a person that’s in need of being humbled.”

  And then he kisses her. Kisses away the pain the Weasel had no right in causing, making her forget her worth. 

  “Don’t ever let anyone tell you who you are. You know yourself. You know your worth. You are a good person, Hermione Granger. I could name just about a thousand good qualities you possess and barely any flaws. Because you do have your flaws just as any human being does.” He wipes the tear that escapes her eye. 

  She doesn’t say anything, only connects their lips, saying everything she doesn’t know how to put into words. 

  She never stops kissing him, eventually straddling his lap and snogging him senseless. Her hands running through his locks and tongue moving against his. 

  He places his hands on her arse and pushes her harder against him, getting up and walking towards the bedroom. Their lips never leave each other, completely and utterly consumed with one another. 

  Somewhere along the wall, she’d kicked her shoes off, hearing a clatter on the floor. He couldn’t care less though, not when she was kissing him so sweetly. 

  He lays her on the bed, beginning to gently strip her of her clothes.

  First he took off her scarlet and gold dress. It hugged her figure perfectly, eventuating her broad rib cage and wide hips. 

  Then came the knickers, emerald green, and the matching bra. It’s different than the one she wore for his birthday but fuck she looks beautiful. 

  As he slid her knickers off, his eyes never strayed from hers, watching as her patience slowly dissolves. It’s one of the most satisfying things to witness. 

  He bent down to press an open-mouthed kiss on her thigh. Another, and then another, and it went on as so until she was whining and begging for him; it was all just from him kissing and biting her thighs. 

  Pride trickles into his veins. 

  He moves up to her cunt despite her trying to pull him up towards her mouth, pulling his fringe so hard it truly did hurt. 

  He presses a sloppy kiss on her cunt. And that’s all she gets because he moves up to her lower belly, kissing and bruising wherever he can get his mouth to touch. 

  Her honey skin is soft and sweet. 

  His hands touch every piece of skin he can as he kisses his way up her belly, leaving bruises and bites anywhere and everywhere. 

  Marking her has always been his favorite thing; it means he’s claiming her, that she belongs to him in every way. And she knows that, he knows that she does. 

  He kisses in between the valley of her breasts, making sure to tease her a bit extra here and taking note of how sensitive she already is. 

  He slides his tongue against her nipple and she throws her head back, whining like he has been edging her since yesterday. And it makes him chuckle at just how desperate and needy she is for him. 

  Doing it again and again, moving onto the next nipple and repeating his ministrations there too. She’s crying out, groaning, and attempting to pull him up. 

  He leaves his marks as he finds his way up to her throat, feeling her heavy breathing. She wraps her legs around his waist, pulling him in as close as she possibly can.  

  Beginning to tease her again, he kisses and bites her neck as he pinches her pretty brown nipples. It makes her buck her hips in search of any sort of friction, grinding against the air and feeling as frustrated as ever. 

  “Baby, baby, please.” She takes his head in her hands, shaking as they may be, she still holds him firmly. “No teasing tonight, please. I — I just need you.” Pure desperation is etched into her eyes as she begs him to just take her. 

  And because it’s Christmas and he feels shitty for the way things at the Potter house went, he obliges. He doesn’t tease and doesn’t taunt, or make her wait, he only places a chaste kiss on her lips before he stands up. 

  He begins unbuttoning his shirt, slipping his shoes off as he does so, eyes never leaving hers because if there is one thing they both love about having sex with eachother is how intense eye contact makes it all. He stares into his favorite pair of honey eyes and it only makes their experience better. 

  His fingers move to his belt, unbuckling it and throwing it on the floor somewhere he doesn’t quite care enough to know. The buttons of his trousers are unfasten right after, pulling his trousers and briefs all in one go. 

  It isn’t as slow and sexy as he’d wanted to do but she needs him 
  
    now 
  
  not later when he finishes teasing her with stripping. 

  But he knows they’ll have time for that another night. 

  When he’s fully naked and bare, he steps in between her legs, grabbing and lifting them up so he could step deeper into her. She lifts herself up too, wrapping her arms around his neck and legs tighter around his waist and kissing him.

  He moves them farther up the bed, kissing as they go up. Her fingers massage his scalp and hands rubbing his back. His hands are on her thigh and cheek. 

  She breaks the kiss panting and with a face that’s scarlet colored. And in that moment he enters her, putting his cock in as slow as possible, wanting to savor every sensation he feels. 

  She gasps a breath, holding it in until he’s fully inside of her. It feels fucking incredible being inside of her pretty cunt; she’s warm and slick and just everything he loves. 

  He places his forehead against hers, grabbing her hands and intertwining their fingers, and bringing them above her head. 

  Then he begins moving inside of her, pumping slowly at first. Their breathing worsens, both gasping for breaths as they continue to stare into each other’s eyes. 

  He isn’t even doing much but it’s just 
  
    intense. 
  
  It feels different because they’ve never done something like 
  
    this 
  
  before. Usually, he’d tease and edge but tonight they went straight to the fucking. But it isn’t a quick fuck, it’s slow and sensual as unsaid feelings encroaches the air. 

  She digs the heels of her feet into his arse cheeks, making him move faster. The noises she’s making only increase with time, blowing them straight into his face and watching her expression up close. He’s truly enjoying this. 

  He’s moving in and out, in and out of her cunt; it’s quick now that so much time has passed. It’s only gasping and moaning and the slamming of the bed against the wall and the slap of their hips against each other. It’s the perfect chorus to listen to for hours. 

  “Fuck, baby.” She kisses him for as long as she can before the burning sensation in her lungs becomes too much. “R…right there, Draco, 
  
    fuck.
  
  ” 

  His cock slams into her spot, making her scream her throat raw, making her nails dig into his back. 

  She lifts her legs higher making him go deeper inside of her already throbbing cunt, willing to take more of him as if she’s some sort of superhuman. 

  He pistons his hips into hers so roughly he’s sure there’ll be bruises on both of them but that’s okay because he welcomes them. 

  “
  
    Fuck, you feel so good, baby. So wet for me. You take me so well.” 
  
  He breathlessly says to her, feeling his dancing along the edge of the cliff coming to the most amazing end. 

  She flutters around him and it’s seconds after she cums, screaming and digging her nails and heels into his arse cheeks. 

  And he cums seconds after her, gasping and groaning into her mouth as he connects their lips so quickly. He breaks the kiss just as fast, still cuming inside of her. How it has lasted this long is a mystery. 

  Panting like his lungs seized to work he says, “
  
    I love you. Fuck, I love you, baby. Gods, Granger.
  
  ” 

  Finally, finally, he said what he’d been dying to get out. And in the most euphoric of times. It’s quite honestly perfect. 

  She slams her lips on his, still panting but it didn’t matter because he needs this kiss, 
  
    they
  
   need this kiss. 

  He slumps on her, leaning his weight onto her body. 

  Fuck he loves her, loves her so much it hurts. And he has for so long; it just took him a bit of time to come to terms with it. 

  As they catch their breaths, relishing in the addicting high of said feelings and intense orgasms, he manages to flip them around so that she’s atop of him. She places her head into the crook of his neck and there they stay. 

  It feels different, feels like they’ve opened a new door in their relationship. They did, didn’t they? He gets to tell her he loves her as many times as he’d like and before he could barely even get it out. 

  He passes his hand over her back, across her shoulder blades, down to her arse, and everyone he can. But when his hand gets too tired, he rests his hand on the back of her, tangled in her curls. 

  There they stayed for a long time. Knowing what hour it was wasn’t a priority while basking in this feeling of completion, 
  
    almost 
  
  completion. All he knew is that throughout the time they spent lying together, it was the most comfortable silence he has ever felt. 

  But just when he thinks she has fallen asleep he hears her voice. “Happy Christmas, baby.” It’s soft and quiet, nearly murmured. 

  A wide smile splits his lips. “Happy Christmas, baby.” 

  She lifts her head to look at him, a smile etched into her pretty swollen lips. She moves herself higher and presses a kiss against his lips. And they snog as if it’s the first time their lips have ever touched. 

  “How’d you know it was midnight?” he says against her lips, curiosity peaking in him because he couldn’t even find it in himself to care about the time. 

  She giggles against his lips, gliding her tongue once more against his. “I set my wand to vibrate once it was midnight. I see it vibrating on my dress.” She smiles cutely, making his heart flip. 

  “My little swot.” He brings his fingers to her cheek and she leans into him. “I’ve got you something.”

  She gasps. “Draco Malfoy, I am 
  
    not 
  
  a swot for wanting to know when it’s Christmas,” she chastises, gaze withering as she stares at him. 

  He chuckles, shoulders and head shaking, pulling her into a kiss. 

  She lightly smacks his arm but doesn’t separate their lips, deepens it as a matter of fact. 

  Unfortunately, he breaks the kiss first, wanting to give her the gift he’d gotten for her. 

  He summons the small box. It’s velvet and navy blue and about the size of his palm. He holds it out to her saying, “Here, baby.”

  She stares at it, eyes wide and lips ajar. “Draco…”

  “Open it.” He smiles. 

  “Uhm, can you maybe open mine first? I, er, been really looking forward to seeing your reaction.”

  “Yeah, baby, I’ll open it first.” 

  She summons a small box along with an envelope. What could it be?

  “A few months ago, you told me the Ministry denied your request for a pardon for your mum.” She exhales heavily. “You’d wanted one because her memory shouldn’t be tarnished when she’d done nothing wrong. But they hadn’t cared because of her association with everything.” 

  Taking it from her fingers, his eyes begin to burn, hands shaking and heart beating so fucking fast. He traces the edge before he begins to rip open the envelope. 

  He feels her hot gaze on him but he couldn’t look at her, not yet. 

  He removes the folded paper and opens it, reading every single word, absorbing it all and committing it to memory. His vision blurs as he reads. 

  
    Narcissa Malfoy is officially pardoned. She is not a criminal. 
  

  As much as he tried to keep it in, a sob rips from his chest; fucking happy sobs. 

  “Baby… shit, I thought…” Worry is etched into her eyes. “Draco.” She grabs his face and wipes the tears already staining his cheeks. 

  All he can think to do is kiss her, melding their lips together, letting their tongues dance together; it’s 
  
    his 
  
  way of thanking her, of communicating how fucking badly he appreciates this, of fucking telling her how badly he loves her for this. 

  He squeezes her tightly against himself, never intending to let go of her. And she softens against him, realizing that his reaction was nothing but of pure and unadulterated appreciation. 

  
    I love you. 
  

  
    I’m gonna keep you. 
  

  
    Mine. 
  

  
    I fucking love you. 
  

  “It’s perfect,” he says against her lips, heart beating rapidly and breathing heavily against her. “Perfect, perfect, perfect. 
  
    Thank you.
  
  ”

  She giggles, bringing her fingers to his fringe and pulling him impossibly closer. “I’m glad, baby.” 

  Then she’s pulling away with an eager smile and handing him the other gift. He’s just as excited. 

  He smiles brightly, taking the small box in his palm and lifting the top off. In it is a Slytherin green band with her initials engraved onto them. 

  He moves his gaze to her, shock etched into every inch of his face, and she only smiles more as she brings her hand up and shows him her matching one with 
  
    his 
  
  initials engraved into it. 

  “Gods, Granger,” he mumbles to himself, totally at a loss of words as examines the beautiful band. “This —“ 

  She drops her hand from where it was in the air. “Do you not like it? I can… I can get you something else if you’d like.” Her voice shakes and she has got it all wrong. 

  “Baby, I absolutely love this.” He tangles his fingers in her curls once again and brings her close, resting his forehead on hers. “You’re incredible. Thank you.” 

  He kisses those pretty lips once more before he pulls back to give her his present. “I don’t think this’ll beat your gifts so I’ll get you something else.”

  “I think it’ll be just perfect. I don’t need anything else but this one.” Her eyes flit between the box, going from him to the box and back and forth. 

  “I’ll let you in on a secret: if you open the box, you’ll find out what’s in it. Mind blowing, I know.” He chuckles at his own sarcasm and she smacks him. 

  “Malfoy,” she warns and it’s hilarious, making him chuckle harder, holding onto his chest as it wracks through him. “Draco!”

  “Alright… alright, go on then.”

  She opens the box and out it goes, flying just in front of her face with its yellow wings. 

  He sees the confusion etched into her brows and he only smiles. 

  “You remember all those years ago when you told me, and I apologize for even speaking his name, that the Weasel said you weren’t a prize? That you weren’t a Golden Snitch” He looks down at his fingers, a smirk etched onto his face. “Then I told you that you were one — 
  
    are 
  
  one — and that left you speechless.”  

  Her face is set and there’s something in her eyes that sparkles as she watches the snitch fly around. 

  “You are a prize and I decided to give you this because I want you to always remember. I want you to always remember your worth and most of all I want you to know that you will always be better than an average Golden Snitch.” Exhilaration courses through him as he says all these things. He has been holding it all in for months. 

  Her face contorts again, confusion evident. 

  He lifts his hand up and the snitch flies and lands on his hand. “This isn’t just any gold or copper. It’s… well, I can’t actually pronounce that tongue-twister of a word but it’s the strongest, most rare material to ever exist.” She chuckles nervously. “I know you know the name.”

  He hasn’t moved his gaze just yet because he’s nervous, and doesn't know what she may think. But he forces himself anyway because he’ll have to eventually. 

  She’s got tears in her eyes, jaw trembling. 

  “I, er, got your name engraved into it, too. I want you to remember who the prize is and that you’re worth every struggle,” he whispers because it doesn’t seem like the moment to speak so loudly. 

  And in a flash she’s straddling him, hugging him tightly and crying into his neck while blubbering a chorus of words that make him feel wonderful. 

  
    Thank you. 
  

  
    I love it. 
  

  
    Fuck, thank you. 
  

  
    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
  

  
    You — you really are the sweetest person. 
  

  It’s a chorus of words, sweet words, and it just makes him so glad that she loves it. He really wanted to make her feel as special as she truly is. 

  “I love you. I love you. Thank you,” she says against his lips, and she’d said it back to him. 
  
    I love you. 
  
  She’d said it back. 

  She loves him, too. This is the best Christmas he has ever fucking had. 

  He cups her cheeks, breaking the kiss to get a few words in, nudging his nose against hers as she beams a smile at him. 

  “One more thing.” He makes more space between them, and brings the snitch in between them. “If you place it here.” He places it on her pulse point. “It’ll open.”

  He shows her it, holding it up to her so she could see. 

  She takes it into her hand and pulls out a note that was inside of it. She smiles, biting her lips, as her fingers unfold the note. 

  “Read it aloud, baby.”

  She skims it really quick, eyes brightening and looking up at him with nothing but adoration. “For my girl. I hope you love it as much as I love you. You’re 
  
    the 
  
  prize.You’re 
  
    my 
  
  prize.”

  Tears threaten to spill over her cheeks as she looks at him, no words at the top of her tongue. 

  “Say something. You’re making me nervous, Granger.” He pulls her in, pressing a kiss to her lips and stroking her messy curls. 

  “I don’t deserve you.” Her voice is low and is full of emotion. 

  “Baby —“

  “You’re too good for me, Draco Malfoy.” She wraps her arms around his shoulders, pulling him into her body tightly. 

  “I’ll never be too good enough, Hermione Granger, but I’ll try for you.”

  February 14, 2006

  To love someone is to never stop thinking of them, is to do something good with them in mind, is to try and better yourself for them because they deserve the best of you. 

  He never thought he’d love someone this deeply, never thought he’d get to love anyone at all. But most of all, he never thought someone would love him, never thought he’d get to feel those butterflies or flush so deeply like a first year. 

  It’s shocking how different his life is compared to how he’d thought it would be, but he wouldn’t change it for the world. 

  He loves her and it is an undeniable fact. 

  And funny enough, today’s the day to celebrate that love. 

  
    He’d been making tea for them in the kitchen, deciding on how to tell her about his plans. The scent wafted through the air around him. 
  

  
    It was quiet for a while, until he heard heels clacking against the wooden floor. She rarely wore those, he knew, so it must be a special occasion. 
  

  
    He’d turned once he heard that she was closer to him. She wore a short golden dress that accentuated her pretty waist and Golden Girl title. Her hair was pinned up and she had minimal makeup on. 
  

  
    It was an odd sight because he’d only seen her dressed like that a handful of times. And he doesn’t remember mentioning anything about what he had planned. 
  

  
    He only looked at her, looked until she met his eyes and lightly smiled. 
  

  
    “What are you doing?” he asked, it was the only question he could fathom. His confusion was evident in his furrowed brows and narrowed eyes. 
  

  
    She picked her coat up, throwing it over her arm. “Ginny and Harry broke up and she needs me, baby. I’m taking her out so she can try and forget.” She breathed out heavily. “It’s the least I can do since I’ve basically ghosted her for the last few years.”
  

  
    “Ghosted her?” His confusion only heightens. 
  

  
    “I’ve spent all my time with you, which I don’t regret at all, and she knows and respects that because she sees how happy I am, but she’s hurting and I think I should be there for her since she has been nothing but an amazing friend to me.”
  

  
    “I, uh, I had plans for us tonight,” he murmured, fiddling his fingers against the teacup in his hand. “It’s Valentine’s Day, you know.”
  

  
    He had meticulously planned this day. Sleep in, cuddle with her, press kisses where he could, and that lasted the entire morning. Then he’d force himself to leave her and make them some breakfast. They ate breakfast and then he’d eaten desert — her pretty, wet cunt — and then they slept until, well now. And once he would give her tea, he’d tell her to get dressed, take her to dinner, and surprise her with a little something in her champagne. 
  

  
    “Baby…”
  

  
    He shook his head, not trusting his voice. It was hard to speak when his throat closed up the way it did. He really had been looking forward to today. 
  

  
    “Draco, I didn’t even —“ She sighs, dropping her coat and walking towards him. “I didn’t even realize.” She was in front of him then, placing her hands on his chest. “I — I never celebrate today. I really did forget, baby, I’m so sorry.”
  

  
    He couldn’t bring himself to look at her, because he knew it’d just hurt. 
  

  
    It wasn’t her fault that she forgot because he never even mentioned the day. It wasn’t her fault that this day was cursed for her. It wasn’t her fault that she had made plans like it was another ordinary day. It was his fault. 
  

  
    “It’s… it’s fine. Enjoy your night, Granger,” he clipped, and walked to his room, never looking back at her. He wasn’t going to make a show about it. 
  

  
    And it was only because he knew he wasn’t the only person that existed to her, he was one of many, so he’d let her go, and didn't fight her on it. 
  

  
    She’d never know that he revolved his life around her like the Earth revolves around the Sun. It was something that shouldn’t be but he couldn’t help it. 
  

  
    It wouldn’t have been fair to argue with her, so he let himself hurt because he didn’t have any right to get upset with her, but he did have every right to be upset with himself. 
  

  
    He sat his tea down on his nightstand and slipped back into bed, summoned a book and began to read. The words wouldn’t stay in his mind even as he read it more than once. The only thing on his mind was how lonely he’d be on this day. Again. 
  

  
    There wasn’t much he could do, there wasn't much he even wanted to do. But sitting there and crying wasn’t going to do it, because he didn’t get to, he caused this. 
  

  
    It’d been a few minutes until he heard the door open, heels clicked towards his side of the bed. He never looked up, because he knew if he did, she’d trigger all the emotions he’d been trying to keep down. 
  

  
    He flipped the page he didn’t even read, had only stared at, and picked his tea up and took a sip of the scorching liquid. It didn’t burn, or it did but he just didn’t feel it. 
  

  
    A hand took the teacup out of his fingers and same with the book. He tried to resist but she was adamant and it was fucking irritating. 
  

  
    “Draco…” 
  

  
    He lied on his side and turned to face the opposite of her, going to sleep instead of listening to whatever it was she had to say. 
  

  
    It was childish to act like this, he knew, but he couldn’t fathom his walls and he never learned to control how he felt and he didn’t want her to see him like this. Because he just knows what’s next for him: tears and tears are weak and he won’t cry in front of her over something like this. 
  

  
    He lifted the sheets to his neck and closed his eyes, feeling the hot tears streak down his eyes and onto the pillow. It shouldn’t be like this, 
  
  
    he
  
  
     shouldn’t be like this. 
  

  
    He felt her climb atop him, and then drop herself in front of him. Her leg stayed over his, then felt her hand on his cheek. 
  

  
    “Don’t be upset with me,” she whispered, lips grazed him as she spoke. “I’ll be back soon and we’ll do whatever you want.” She wiped the tears that stained his cheeks. 
  

  
    He didn’t speak, only practiced on keeping his breathing even, for his sake, because he won’t have a fucking breakdown over this or in front of her. 
  

  
    “I truly didn’t know. I’ve hated this day for as long as I can remember and — and well, eventually, I forgot about it.” She pressed a kiss to his lips. “You didn’t mention the occasion at all today.”
  

  
    She was right. He’d thought a surprise would’ve been romantic, that he could’ve wooed her and made her feel special on this day. 
  

  
    And well…
  

  
    It was like his lips were incapable of moving and voice was dormant and nowhere to be found. 
  

  
    
      Stop being a child. 
    
  

  
    
      Be a fucking man and speak to her. 
    
  

  
    
      Why are you like this?
    
  

  
    She continued to stroke his cheek, pressing kisses every so often. It calmed him, it did. 
  

  
    A couple of minutes passed and those kisses had helped. He’d stopped crying and he breathed calmly. And he was able to open his eyes and look at her. 
  

  
    “I wouldn’t leave if it wasn’t an absolute necessity, baby. I’d never do that.” He felt her breath against his nose. 
  

  
    He had brought his hand to her cheek and leaned in to press a kiss and she kissed back. 
  

  
    “Where are you going?” It was whispered against her lips. 
  

  
    “I’m not sure. Gin gave me what to wear and told me to meet her at her flat.” Their lips met once more. “I’m sorry.”
  

  
    “I was just planning on taking you to dinner.” He attempted to give her a reassuring smile. But it wasn’t just dinner.
  

  
    “When I come back, we’ll do it.” Another kiss pressed  against his lips. 
  

  
    He shook his head. “I’ll leave it for another day.”
  

  
    She rested her forehead on his and breathed out heavily. “I’ll make it up to you. I promise.”
  

  
    “I have a surprise for you.”
  

  
    “And I’m sure I’ll love it, baby. Will you show it to me when I get back?” A hopeful smile had graced her face. 
  

  
    He only kissed her. He couldn’t contain the excitement because the surprise was life-changing. It wasn’t flowers or a necklace. 
  

  
    It was…
  

  And so, that’s what brought him here: knocking at a very familiar door. It’s black wood with one of those cliche brass knocking things. He couldn’t for the life of him remember what it’s called but at least he remembered it’s made of brass. 

  He stood with his hands in his pockets, trying to forget how bloody cold it is, because of course his friends would make him wait, like they don't have house elves to come and open the door. 

  He scowls outwardly at them even though they can’t see. 

  Minutes pass, extremely long minutes, and the door finally swings open, revealing a smirking Theodore Nott. He’s in club clothes. Why? He couldn’t think of a feasible answer. 

  “Were the pair of you making a script on what to say to me?” He glances down at his watch, calculating just how long he was out here. “Five fucking minutes I’ve been standing here.” 

  He looks him up and down. “Blaise,” Theo calls out, a smirk still plastered on his lips. “Baby, you’ll never guess who has risen from the dead.”

  Draco’s scowl deepens. But he inwardly laughs because this is all a joke. 

  “Theo, you truly have the likeness of a child.”

  “I guess that’s why you and I get along so well then.” 

  His facade cracks, making his eyes crinkle and his shoulders begin to shake silently. And Theo does the same as he brings his hand to cover his genuine smile. 

  Draco drops his head, laughing at the ground, shaking his head at the way his and Theo’s friendship is. It’s quite literally his favorite. 

  And gods did he love that man. One of his best friends and just the most hilarious bloke he has ever fucking met. 

  “C’mere, Your Royal Highness,” says Theo, clasping his hand on Draco’s shoulder and pulling him into a tight hug. Draco’s arms wind around the man and squeezes tightly. 

  He hadn’t realized just how badly he’d missed him. It’s like Theo’s absence in his life made this sort of hole form in him and it doesn’t just go for Theo, it also goes for Blaise. He completely and utterly missed his friends. 

  Out of nowhere, Theo pulls back, gasping dramatically, and dropping down onto his knees like some servant. 

  “I apologize. I didn’t bow first, King Malfoy. Forgive me.” His face is set solemnly, and he begins to kneel deeper like he’s going to kiss his shoes. 

  “Nott, you’re fucking unbelievable. Get your arse up, you dumb fuck.” He makes to kick him in the teeth and the wizard dodges, laughing his arse off. 

  “The way you ghosted Blaise and I it’d seemed like you thought you were too high and mighty for us.” There’s his sassy attitude. He doesn’t think he misses this all that much. “Fucking arsehole, get your arse in my house before I change my mind.”

  And they begin to walk in silence. But it wouldn’t be Draco if he didn’t call something out to Theo’s back. “You have such a way of showing me how much you missed me, truly. I feel so loved.”

  “Shove it.”

  It’s utter silence until they get into the living room. He sees Blaise sitting on a chaise with a glass of brandy in his long fingers. He twirls the liquid around as he looks at the two men entering. And upon seeing Draco, his wrist stops it’s movements. 

  Draco smirks as he sits on the chaise opposite of Blaise. “Where can a guy get a drink around here?”

  Theo raises an offended brown brow as he sits next to his lover, summoning a glass and throwing it at Draco. “There. Now you can get your arse up and get yourself a drink, prick.”

  “You aren’t actually upset with me, Theo, so cut the shit.” His voice is sharp though it has nothing but mirth in it. This is the way the lot of them fuck around and it’s quite hard to unetch the smile from his face. 

  Theo sighs a laugh, moving his eyes down to his hands for a moment then back to Draco, his shaking. “Fine, fine. We missed you, really.” This makes him think Theo’s being genuine. “It was saddening how we didn’t get to see your pointy face and chiseled abs.” Until that slips passed his dirty mouth. 

  “All these years of friendship and you still refer to me with such objectifications.” He raises his hand to his heart in mock offense. “I’m a person with emotions.” 

  “You know you love it.” Theo winks at him. 

  Draco adjusts himself on the very comfortable chaise, throwing his leg over his other one and summoning some fire whiskey. “So how have my favorite pair of —“

  “Malfoy,” comes Blaise’s silky voice. “Who’s the witch?” He’d been pouring alcohol into his glass and as if the words were physically there, the glass fell from his fingers. 

  “
  
    For fucks sake, Draco. That bloody carpet costs more than your life
  
  ,” came Theo’s enraged voice. “Bloody fucking shit.” He’s truly upset as he gets up and throws a 
  
    Scourgify. 
  

  He only stares at Blaise, can’t fathom words to leave his mouth. It was out of nowhere that he said that and he looks at him, 
  
    no
  
  , stares at him deeply, like he’s staring into his soul. 

  “I don't know what you’re talking about,” he says after a couple of minutes of silence, crossing his arms and looking away. He knows he looks like a child. 

  It’s like that for long moments and, eventually, Theo finally calms his shit and sits down, though he glares at Draco like he killed his cat. 

  “Cut the shit, pretty boy,” says Blaise, his voice is laced with incredulity, and his face communicates the same. His head tilts to the side as he bores his eyes into Draco. 

  “So what? You’ve skipped the part where you send me owls, so you 
  
    spy 
  
  on me. Bloody hell, the pair of you are bloody weird.” 

  Blaise’s face contorts like he’s trying to conceal his mirth. His eyes crinkle and he looks at him as if he’s being serious. “No, Draco, but it doesn’t take an Auror to see that big arse love bite on your neck.”

  It’s not as if he 
  
    tried 
  
  to cover up the marks she left on him, wouldn’t fucking dream of it. He wears the marks with pride as she does with his. 

  That breaks Theo’s glare and replaces it with widened eyes and then a knowing smirk. And Draco flushes like an idiot, like he hasn’t spoken about sex with his friends all his life. 

  “And let us not forget about the fact that we haven’t seen you in years, 
  
    bloody years
  
  , mate,” Theo chimes in, and just as fast his brows furrow. “Can’t believe you chose a witch over us. A mate you fucking are.”

  He sighs, looking down at his glass, because he’s ashamed. How could he choose a witch over them? But fuck he loves his witch. 

  He doesn’t meet their eyes, can’t meet their eyes. Because it’s never alright to abandon your friends because you’ve got a girlfriend. 

  “Hey.” It’s Theo. “It was a joke.” His voice is sympathetic and Draco just knows his eyes soften from their severity just a few minutes ago. “It would’ve been nice to see you but it is what it is. At least now you won’t go MIA on us again.” He gives him a reassuring smile. 

  “I really am sorry.” His voice is meek and he still feels shitty despite Theo’s reassurance, because he knows damn well that he’d be hurt if one of them abandoned him for a lover. “I’ll make it up to you both.”

  “Yes, you will. And the way you’ll do it is by telling us all about the witch. Details, sexy details, and just who the fuck it is.” Blaise is a true snake and those traits followed him out of Hogwarts. 

  “Start off with who it is.” Theo smirks. 

  He sighs. “No.”

  “No, no, no. If you’re gonna abandon us then the least you can do is tell us for who.” Theo raises his brows. “Don’t be an arse.”

  “C’mon, Draco, we’re your best mates. You’re supposed to tell your best mates about your witch.” Blaise smirks deviously, looking him up and down. 

  He sighs again, this time it’s because he gives up fighting them, and because he’s excited to tell his best friends about the witch that’s got him whipped. 

  He attempts to stifle a smile but just thinking of her makes him immeasurably happy. She’s the source of his every smirk, smile, laugh, and those stupid butterflies that seem to never go away when she’s around him. 

  “Tsk, tsk.” Theo shakes his head, smiling and laughing. “Mate, you're in love, aren’t you?“ He bites his lip, barely able to contain his excitement for his friend, Draco knows. 

  Blaise smiles too and Draco wonders what he did to deserve such supportive friends. He looks over at Theo and they share that look of pride and it truly warms his heart. 

  Their gazes set on Draco as they wait for him to start speaking. He’s nervous, really fucking nervous. Because the witch he’s besotted in, the witch he plans on keeping forever, is the witch he wasn’t all that kind to in their youth. And he doesn’t know just how they’ll react to it. 

  But he’ll tell them either way, and he’ll steel himself, ready to defend her if they even think to say a thing about her. 

  “Granger.” He clears his throat. “I’m with Hermione Granger.” He visibly swallows, eyes flitting between the wizards in front of him. 

  Their eyes widened and brows raised so high. And now he’s waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

  “Didn’t you…”

  “Hate her?” Theo finishes for Blaise. 

  It’s very uncommon to see Blaise at a loss of words and it worries him all the same. 

  “I did in the past. But you know, people change and feelings change.” He nonchalantly shrugs as if this is an everyday conversation, as if he’s isn’t internally panicking. 

  “I’m surprised. Didn’t think I’d ever hear her name again, especially when it’s you telling us 
  
    she’s 
  
  the witch you’re in love with,” Theo says, slowly wiping the shock from his face and replacing it with something he can’t quite decipher. 

  Blaise mirrors his partner, flitting his eyes from Theo to Draco. He twirls his drink, and it seems as if he’s thinking, thinking on to say or thinking about something. It’s driving him to the fucking edge. 

  Theo shares a look with Blaise and it seems like it’s nothing good. 

  “Listen, I don’t care if you don’t support it or still hold those disgusting prejudices but I love her and I’m not going to stop loving her just because my friends are a pair of racist arseholes.” It’s said and now he’ll wait for their outburst. Everything he said is true. He couldn’t leave her when he fucking loves her this damn much. 

  Theo and Blaise narrow their eyes, looking at him with disbelief and disgust. Theo sets his drink down and Blaise’s wrist stops moving. 

  “I’ve never held those prejudices, mate, and if fucking sucks that you’d assume that shit. Because if you’ve heard the things I have, you’d —“ Blaise places his hand on Theo’s, stopping him from continuing whatever it was he was about to say. 

  “Like you said, Draco, people change and feelings change. We don’t give a shit about blood. And you shouldn’t have assumed that.” Blaise’s voice is calm and collected, he has always been more of the kind of person to think first and then speak, whereas Theo will say exactly what he thinks. 

  “Well with the fucking the pair of you shared it felt like you were judging me or something.” He breathes out, letting go of the tension and anger in his bones. “What exactly was that look?”

  Theo and Blaise are quiet for a few moments, eyes looking at anywhere but him. 

  Draco sighs, starting to stand up so that he can leave. To say he’s disappointed is an understatement because he truly wanted his friends to be happy for him. Even if he is in love with a witch like Hermione Granger. 

  He sets his drink down on the table, giving a tight lipped smile and clenching his jaw as sets the teacup on the coffee table. 

  It’s a bitter feeling that encroaches him. It feels horrible and he wishes he’d just stayed home; it would’ve saved him the heartache. 

  His legs begin to carry him out of the living room and just before he is about to grab his coat he hears, “Draco, c’mon, we haven’t seen you in years.” It’s Blaise calling out from the living room and he hears as he comes closer until he’s just a few feet away from him. “Let’s just forget about this conversation and let’s go out like we used to.” He claps his hand over Draco’s shoulder, offering a smile. “Please.”

  Draco only stares at him. He couldn’t let himself continue to hang around people who thought negatively about his relationship, so he isn’t all that sure about this. “What was that look, Blaise?”

  Blaise sighs, pursing his full umber lips. “We were just surprised. That was our surprised face.” He offers a smile. 

  He’s hesitant as he watches the wizard in front of him, as he watches the uneasy wrinkle in between his brows and the slight down curve of his lips.

  And eventually, he drops whatever suspicion that lingers in the back of his mind, deciding that trusting his friends is the way that it should be. 

  When he does so, Blaise smiles at him but this time with no wrinkles in his eyes, slings his arm around Draco’s shoulders, and begins to guide him back to the living room. 

  Then he sits and stays quiet, eyes flitting between the two men that sit in front of him. His thumbs rub together as a way of calming himself; he doesn’t know why he’s so agitated and so he attempts to control himself. 

  “Draco, just how far off are you with Granger? I mean I know you love her but to what extent?” Theo’s voice is curious and it lightens Draco up. He could talk about her for hours and never get tired. 

  He looks down at his fingers, smiling to himself. “Well, I planned on proposing tonight but something with the Weaslette happened so I’ve got to replan everything. But she’s going to be mine forever.” He smiles and it strains his cheeks so deliciously. 

  Theo shuts his eyes, squeezing them together and Blaise brings his hand to Theo’s and intertwines their fingers. Theo smiles at him though it’s off and doesn’t look anything like how a happy one should and Blaise’s face looks strained, but he smiles nonetheless. 

  “That — that’s great, Draco. I’m so glad that you’ve found someone to love like that.” Theo’s voice is quiet and he bites his lip after he gets the words out. And Blaise nods his head in agreement. 

  Draco takes the velvet box from his trouser pocket, smiling at it as he shows two of the most important people in his life how he future will play out. 

  “Wow.” It’s said at the same time and it’s not a rare occurrence for the couple in front of him to have the same thoughts. 

  He opens the box and reveals the ring. It’s modest and something that he knows she’ll accept, because she isn’t the kind of person to want something extravagant or with diamonds that cost a vault and a half. 

  “I think she’ll love it.” And he doesn’t show this to them but he moves his eyes to the words engraved into the band. 
  
    My Golden Snitch. 
  

  He moves his gaze onto his friends and they’re speechless, only staring at him, and he cocks a brow at their sudden silence. He pockets the ring and settles his arm on the side of the chaise and the other on his thigh. 

  And he smiles like an idiot. He’s going to have a wife soon and it’s going to be someone he loves, not someone who he’d be forced to bear an heir with, but someone who he’ll willingly give a baby to. 

  “So…” Theo stands, gliding his fingers through his messy acorn curls and exhaling heavily. “Are we going out or are we just going to sit here like a bunch of lazy arses?”

  It’s only a few minutes before they’re out the door and apparating together to Merlin knows where, but he trusts them so he’ll let them lead him. 

  They land in front of an abandoned building. It’s… well it’s something but he didn’t expect it to be 
  
    this. 
  
  He looks around and looks to see what Theo and Blaise are doing, but he can’t even fathom what’s going on before his eyes, so he doesn’t even try. 

  Soon enough, they’re leading him through doors and into a loud, very fucking loud, club. But this isn’t any ordinary club, it looks like a… sex club? Most regular clubs don’t have people fucking on the couch just a few feet away from the entrance. 

  
    What the fuck?
  

  There are so many people dancing and laughing and having the time of their lives, along with people having sex and doing things he’d never think to do. There are trays of alcohol floating around for anyone to grab and naked dancers on tall platforms for everyone to see. 

  And he sees this girl with acorn colored hair and a pretty emerald dress that fits her well. She laughs and dances with no care in the world and she looks so free. It’s beautiful the way she is and he knows one day he’ll get to be like her. 

  Blaise and Theo sling their arms over his shoulders and it just further increases his anger. It’s truly fucking disrespectful of them to even think about taking him to a place like this. 

  “So I tell you I’m planning on proposing to my girlfriend and you both decide to take me to a sex club?” His eyes are narrowed and his rage grows as the seconds pass by. “This is so —“

  “Mate, relax. This is our club. We opened it a few years ago and we wanted to show you it. You weren’t around when he planned and constructed it,” Theo says into his ear and for a moment it makes his rage melt. “We’re really quite proud of how it has turned out.”

  “And many people adore the club.” Blaise begins leading them towards the bar to get a drink, he presumes, and he sees as they greet and wave at different people through the whole course. 

  He thinks he’ll just look around and mostly stay by the bar. He really has no business in this place but he’ll stay for the sake of his friends; Merlin knows they’ve been just the best. 

  Taking a glass of fire whiskey, he sips it as he listens to the music blaring around him. At least the music isn’t terrible. 

  “Mate, we’ll be right back. There’s been some problem on the other side of the club. We’ll be back here.” Theo clasps his hand on Draco’s shoulder, giving it a firm squeeze, and Draco nods and sits on a stool. 

  He sits there for a couple of minutes and it gets boring. Sitting still has never been his favorite thing to do and in a club much less. 

  So, he begins to look around. He has never been to a club like this and the curiosity is getting to him because there’s only so much self-control he can fathom. 

  It’s just mindless looking. He won’t stare at something or someone because it’s disgusting and he has his witch already. Looking at his glass of alcohol isn’t very interesting either. 

  His wandering eyes land on these sort of rooms. Rooms he presumes are for privacy, where people have sex. It seems like the only ethical thing in the club but he’ll keep that to himself. 

  No one seems to be around those rooms but it caught his attention and so he studies them from afar. The black doors are lined side by side with intricate patterns on them. The interior design class Theo took as a child really paid off. 

  When he saw it, he thought his eyes were deceiving him, thought maybe it was a coincidence that they’d have the same hair and the same style, thought the outfit might’ve been a common one. 

  But no. 

  No that isn’t the case whatsoever. 

  Because Hermione Granger is in this sex club. And she is being led into one of those private sex rooms by another bloke, and that same bloke has just kissed her lips. 

  
    Chapter Text
    
  Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side
  
  And tell, just tell me what you're doing with that other guy
  
  'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the pace
  
  All your girlfriends are wasted
  
  They need it, they chase it
  
  Face it, you want it, you crave it
  
  Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it
 
   

  
    All of your friends have been here for too long
    
    They must be waiting for you to move on (woo)
    
    Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone
    
    I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (woo)
    
    Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
    
    Running in circles, now look what you've done (woo)
    
    Give you my word as you take it and run
    
    Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now. 
  

  February 14, 2006 
Words will never be able to describe how he feels at this very moment. His heart thrums in his ears, music as loud as it’s blaring couldn’t remove his focus from the way her lips move against the man that isn’t him. The bloke's arms slide along her body like he’s familiar with it; hers do the same. And it reminds him of how  they  touched each other just a few hours ago. Their morning had been euphoric. Spent between making love and holding each other. They shared kisses and spoke of things he wouldn’t ever dare tell another soul. It becomes increasingly hard to breathe, or to even think. He wants to find some sort of reason or excuse as to why she's doing this. But he can’t. There isn’t anything to defend or explain because it is all clearly there. This is who she ditched him for, this is  what she ditched him for. This is what she’s doing. Cheating on him. Proving every word she uttered to him to be false. He breaks their kiss, taking her hand, and leading her into the room. That forsaken room. The door closes and it’s like something snaps in Draco. He begins to walk to the other side of the room, shoving passed anyone in his way. He refuses to let her do this to him, refuses to just stand there as she contradicts every single fucking thing she has ever said to him. Fuck her. Fuck her stupid promises. 
   Baby.  

   I love you.  

   I’d do anything for you, Draco Malfoy.  

   You’re one of a kind.  

   I don’t think I’ve ever felt this way about someone like I do with you.  

   I’m yours. Only yours.  
Liar.Such a fucking liar. She could’ve chosen to mess with anyone in this world, could’ve chosen to break someone else. Why did it have to be him? He’s at the door now, slamming every bit of his magic against it and knocking it off of its hinges. His hands thrum and pulse with the rage that bubbles inside of him. His face feels electric, like the rage bubbling is making a circuit in him malfunction. It’s probably what’s happening. His patience is deteriorating by the second, by each heavy breath she takes as she stares at him in shock. Her hair is tussled, chest rising and falling quickly, dress hanging by her waist, and tits out with the bruises  he left on her this morning and afternoon. But she’s glistening with saliva. It makes him gag, gag so fucking badly he nearly turns over and vomits at the sight in front of him. His chest aches, his heart pounds, his eyes are beginning to water, and it feels like it’s all crashing down. The little fort he managed to build around his life, protecting him and keeping him sane, has been infiltrated from the inside. The person he locked up with him, who he thought he’d spend the rest of his life with, has smashed it all open and left him bare to the world like he’s some sort of piece of scum. She’s scrambling to lift the sleeves of her dress up her shoulders, attempting to conceal the body he thought to be his. Only to be shared with some random bloke who doesn’t even deserve her. 
   She’s supposed to be mine.  

   Mine.  

   The initials on the pendant.  

   The words she’d say to me.  

   Everything.  
His eyes flit to the man standing next to Granger. His chest puffs in and out, a confused expression is etched onto his face, and it’s when he meets Draco’s eyes that he begins to walk towards her like Draco is the one that shouldn’t be here and he is her protector. 
   I’m supposed to be the one protecting her.  
The lights in the club flash blue and red, smoke coming through the floors, and magic sparkling through the roof. The music is… absolutely mute. All he can hear is the betrayal yelling at him in the face and it comes from her — the beautiful girl that was supposed to be his wife in a few months. “Draco,” she whispers hoarsely, it’s nearly a whine, a sad, pathetic, whine as her eyes blur and tears fall. “Draco, I promise —“His lips part and he goes to say something, but nothing leaves his lips. Not a sound. He doesn’t know what to say. There are many ways he’d imagined he would get his heart broken, but this never crossed his mind. Never thought she could be capable of something like this. The question echoes in his head over and over. There isn’t an answer, can’t fathom one, and all he feels is like this might just be his punishment for all of his sins. 
   Why? 

   How could she do something like this? 
The isolation and self-hatred had been inflicted by him, he did it all, but this? This is what has been coming for him all long. Tears cloud his vision. “Hey.” She’s in front of him now, hand on his chest and another on his cheek. “Can we get out of here?” Tears stream down her cheeks and she looks like she’s nothing short from falling to her knees and sobbing. “Maybe we can talk?”He hears her words, understands them, but the rage he feels coursing through him is raging a fire so damn powerful he can’t control himself. She’s lightly nudging him from the room, speaking through the sobs that threaten to wrack through her chest. She looks so heartbroken. Looks so sorry. So regretful. 
   If this hurts her so badly, why'd she come here in the first place?  

   Why didn’t she just stay with me?  

   Why couldn’t she just love me in our flat? 
His heart pounds quickly, so quickly he thinks it’ll jump out of his chest. It’s painful, everything is painful. Her touches have become painful. He hears her quiet whispers and murmurs promising to explain, promising that she loves him, promising to make this up to him. And then her lips meet his in a sensual kiss filled with salty tears, silent promises, and comforting squeezes. His lips don’t respond, his arms don’t wound around her frame, fingers don’t tangle in her curls. Nothing. Just nothing. The kiss acts as a reboot. It reboots his senses and places him on the ground, back in reality and back into the situation. He’d gone away, lost in his thoughts, and eventually lost himself somewhere far away. Until she kissed him. And reminded him of everything he truly wishes he could forget. His fingers wrap around her wrists tightly, removing her arms from his body and pushing her away from him. Her touch is like poison; it burns, hurts. He remembers when he used to crave it. It was only just this morning but it feels so distant now. Her chest puffs in and out quickly, brows furrow, and jaw trembling. She reaches for him, fingers shaking, and it’s like he can see her heart breaking through her eyes. Why is  her heart breaking?Their eyes lock. It feels like a punch in the chest. “What are you doing?” It’s a broken whisper, all he can manage. The tears can be heard through his voice and it hates how weak he sounds. “Gran —” “Please…”His eyes flit to the man behind her. He’s rigid, and looks as if he’s about to leave. And it only makes Draco realize that now isn’t the time to fall apart or to even speak to her. He refuses to be weak in front of a stranger. It’s like he’s frozen, can’t move, can’t speak, can’t do anything. All his body wants to do is crumble in itself. No. And so he turns, shaking his head and muttering words even he doesn’t understand. His legs take him anywhere but this room. One, two, three steps in, nearly out of the room, and a hand grabs his forearm. The fingers are wet and shake dangerously. The grip is nearly piercing and it makes him clench his jaw to the point where he thinks his teeth will break. The touch itself is like being set on fire. It’s like poison. The thing he once found comfort in is now the thing that hurts him. Poison. 
   Why does it have to be like this?” 
With that touch, the rage bubbling in the cauldron inside of him overflows, exploding like a volcano that’s long overdue. Violent reactions. He breathes, letting her turn him to face her. She looks like a proper mess, he guesses she deserves whatever she feels. “Please don’t leave me. We can talk and I’ll explain.” She begs with her last breath, so hopelessly, so ravenous.Seeing her like this, like she hasn’t caused this pain for the both of them, only further ignites the unadulterated rage that melts his veins. It completely strips him of his control. It takes away the feeling of heartbreak, makes it dormant, and razes his nerves with a temper he couldn’t dream of occluding. In the last moments, the lights in the room crackle and shatter, the others around them blink. Everything slows down and he watches as the bloke begins to creep out of the room, he senses his fear. Fear of the Death Eater. But he couldn’t find it in himself to care. The object of his attention is her. Because even if that man was involved, she  knew what she was doing, their relationship was kept in the comfort of his flat. Not because of any reason, just the fact that he isn’t welcomed anywhere and prefers his home to anywhere else. No one knew about them. Only she did. This thought only increases his anger with her. He is so upset with her, so upset he couldn’t even dream of a day where he could possibly ever forgive her. He promised himself to always forgive her no matter what happened. Because he loved her unconditionally, and people make mistakes.If you love someone, you’ll forgive them. No matter the mistake. But this isn’t a mistake. Far from it. “W-we can work… this out. Draco, I — promise —“ She tries to make this situation better, tries to trick him with her velvety voice. But he has seen the truth and there is nothing that could justify this. “Tell me what you’re doing on the other side.” His voice is deadly calm, though that doesn’t take from hammer pounding on his chest. He can feel angry, but that only stems from the pain blooming from his shattered heart. He asks only because he needs to hear  her say it, needs to have it confirmed, needs the satisfaction. Though he thinks, in the end, he won’t be satisfied with the answer. Who would be satisfied with getting cheated on?“And so, just tell me what you’re doing with that other guy.” His lip curls then presses into a line. It leaves a foul taste on his tongue. Words he never thought he would ever have to utter. Not to a girl like her. She doesn’t speak or go to answer. She continues to search his face for whatever she’s trying to find, sobbing and attempting to salvage whatever is left of them. He avoids meeting her eyes. It just  hurts.  He cannot look at her in the eyes after all the promises she broke before his eyes. Meeting her eyes feels worse than getting crucioed. It feels like the same way he felt watching his mum die. Because he’s watching their love drown in a pit of betrayal. Nothing hurts worse than being betrayed by the person you love most in the world. Her lips don’t move besides their tremble from her tears and it only angers him more. She can think to do all of this but can’t fathom words to tell him. The man she is betraying. “I don’t have patience with you, Granger.” He turns to start leaving again and he sees a glimpse of Ginny, sees how she watches the pair of them. He scoffs. She grabs his wrist, tugging him back, and says, “Can we go? Can we please just talk about this somewhere else?” He bends his neck to look at her, closing the space between them and gazing dangerously at her teary eyes. “Is this some kind of fucking set up? That’s why Ginny fucking Weasley is staring at us like we’re some kind of film?”Her eyes move to where his arm is, eyes flitting around for Ginny until she finally lands on her. Her jaw trembles at the sight and she squeezes his wrist. A tear falls and she looks back up at him, shaking her head and trying to suppress sobs that crawl up her throat. “I promise—”“What? You promise  what  ?” He rips his wrist out of her hand and takes a step back. “Your girlfriend is wasted. Did she influence you into this? Hm?”  Say yes, Granger. Say fucking yes and give me a way to forgive you.  “Her relationship has gone to shit, so she’s going to fuck up yours? She needs it, she craves it.”Her face contorts, making the agony she’s in so very clear. She passes her hand through her face, wiping the tears and smearing her makeup. And as everything plays out in front of him, he remembers the time where he’d thought they were going to be together forever. It was only a few hours ago but it feels so distant. The memories of their first night together flashes in his mind. When he’d promised to ruin her for any other guy. 
   “Are you sure this is what you want?” His hands traveled from her waist up to her back, pressing her chest into his and kissing her deeply. “You’ll never be able to fuck anyone and not think of me?” His voice is filled with pride and the smirk plastered on his face made her giggle.  

   She tangled her fingers in his hair, putting her tongue in his mouth and dancing with his. “No complaints on my part.” 

   He chuckled, then, darkly and it sent a shiver down her spine. “Face it, you want it, you crave it.” It’s gasping in her neck. “Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it.“ 

   She whimpered into his mouth, grinding into him as hard as she could. She felt manic in his arms. “I know. Now show me what I’ve been craving for years isn’t just all talk.” 

   He took this challenge and absolutely demolished it.  
Or so he thought. If he did, she wouldn’t have been nearly about to sleep with that guy. “Why did you spend the whole day with me if you were planning on cheating? Why did you tell me you love me? Why did you do all of this?” It’s ripped painfully from his throat. He has to be upfront with everything. She’s only crying and more questions continue to pile in his mind. “Baby…”Seeing her hurt, hurts him. He hates seeing her like this, hates that there isn’t a smile on her pretty cheeks. His rage crumbles, he couldn’t remain upset with her. No matter how badly she hurt him. “Just tell me,” he croaks, tears frozen in his throat that's making it impossible to speak. His chin quivers and the wave of rage that previously locked every emotion in, has died and left him in pieces. “I fell in love with you.” Her voice shakes and her chest moves up and down quickly. “But I —““Say it. Just say it. I don’t want the whole story. I just want to know what you were doing.” He takes in a shaky breath, preparing himself for what’s about to leave her lips. Her knuckles turn white and she struggles to get the words out. But he’ll wait for her to say it, he needs to hear it and she’ll give him that satisfaction. “Draco, you know what we were doing,” she chokes out, closing the space between them and placing her hands on his waist. “I am so,  so sorry.”A tear falls down his cheek, and the trembling in his chin becomes violent. His heart has lost its solidness. “ Why?” She sobs and makes his world quake. No matter what, no matter the circumstance or the way he feels, he’ll always hate when she cries. She is in so much pain, it is written on every part of her. Her voice, her eyes, her lips, her cheeks, her heart, everywhere. He thinks he wants to apologize. “We — we aren’t together. We never established anything, so — so I thought we were just… fucking.” Her lips are set into a line, attempting to conceal the way her face contorts. “I thought you were doing the same.”As those words entered his ears, the sorrow became forgotten and was replaced with rage. So quickly it went. It just doesn’t make sense. After all of the things they’ve said to each other, everything they have gone through, every single moment that ever involved them. He just doesn’t understand. He cannot wrap his head around how  she  couldn’t fucking decipher what they were, or  why  she couldn’t just fucking  ask.  “And what the hell were we?” He says, heart thrumming so violently in his chest. “Tell me we weren’t just friends. This doesn’t make much sense, no.”“No, no we weren’t but —“ She cuts herself off as she sees him, truly sees him. “I  never meant to hurt you,” she sobs, pulling him tightly against her. He tries to breathe, tries to keep his lungs from collapsing in this fucking club. He needs to keep himself together, at least until he gets home. She weeps into his chest, and he can’t find any strength in him to push her away. He feels weak, he can’t move or think. The pain of her words shreds every piece of him like it’s acid he’s being bathed in. He can’t handle any of this. He can’t — he just — all of this could’ve been avoided. “I’m not hurt,” he manages to lie after a few minutes, throat closing in on him. “Get the fuck off of me.” He doesn’t grab and push her away, he waits for her to peel herself from him. She does so, looking into his eyes with her blurry ones, and waiting for him to speak. She looks like a child who has been scolded. “How long?” Only to satiate his curiosity. He needs to know how much of their relationship was a lie. He needs to know if this has been one-sided. “Two years,” her jaw trembles as she can visibly see his heart shatter all over again. This time he couldn’t hide it, couldn’t hide the torture she’s inflicting on him. “I’m sorry,” she chokes out. Since the first night they’d spent together and so on. That’s how long. He remembers the saying his mum would always tell him.  Ignorance is bliss. He sways, legs threatening to give out on him. And he realizes there isn’t much he can take at this moment. He needs to leave, needs to fucking get her out of his sight. So he turns and begins to walk away. Tears burning his eyes and body shaking uncontrollably. 
   Two years.  

   Two years.  

   Two years.  
It rings in his ears over and over again. The entire time that she claimed to love him, claimed to want to spend the rest of her life with him, she’d been fucking other guys. He feels betrayed, feels like he’ll never recover from this. This whole thing has been a lie that he got used to. Everything has been destroyed and he has been left to pick up the pieces. The same pieces he has been trying to pick up for his whole life. She chases after him, calling his name and begging him to take her back. His chest freezes and collapses, making it impossible to breathe and keep himself together in the middle of the club. His magic lights his fingertips and as his emotions take reign of him, it becomes hard to control it. Some of the lights flicker and the music cracks. A sigh of relief escapes his lips when he finally sees the door. When he finally manages to step out of the club and drown out her pleas and cries. It’s raining and he’s getting wet but this is better than being in that forsaken club. He had a moment of peace, a moment of utter silence, then she’d bursted out through the door. She was a mess and it was so hard to not hold her, not console her. “I love you. I swear I do,” she gasps, holding her hand to her chest. “We can work this out,” she pleads. She doesn’t walk closer, knowing that he’ll just push her away. “You don’t.  You don’t.”  He has lost any and all will. He hates that she’s upset but he fucking despises that she continues to  lie  to him. “  Stop it.  You don’t love me and you never did,  Hermione.  Leave me the fuck  alone. ” His voice drips with malice and it is all for her. She flinches as she hears her given name slip from his lips for the first time. He had never said her name before and now is when he did. Now. It wasn’t in those moments of pure euphoria or when they lay in each other’s arms just loving each other. It’s when he finds her with another man, in a sex club, on the night he planned to propose. It all clicks now. Just some time it took for him to realize that she was busy fucking around with other guys, while he was at home, trying to be a better man for her. He is so angry, so sad, so fucking confused. But he doesn’t ask or speak again. He looks at her with finality and his lips set in a line. And when she goes to speak he apparates to his flat. On all days this could’ve happened, he wishes it’d been on an earlier day. A day before he’d gotten the ring. A day before he’d fallen in love. A day before he started to care for everything. 
  February 15, 2006
He sobs into the palm of his hand, muffling the gut-wrenching noise that escapes his throat . He squeezes his eyes shut, feeling all the doors crash open. His vision swims and blurs and darkens, eyes rolling back. A hand rubs at his eyes, combing into his hair, pulling back as he does so. It all just fucking  hurts. 
   Why does it have to hurt so fucking bad?  

    Why did he let her have this much power over him? 
His throat feels like he has just swallowed acid; it burns, feels like it’s raw. He thinks he’ll cough out blood at any moment. He gasps for breath, holding onto his throat, massaging it to attempt to dissolve the brick slowly piecing itself together. Times like these make him ask himself if it was really a smart choice to let her in so easily, to give her the power to cause irreparable damage. He should’ve known he couldn’t take anymore, should’ve known that even if the knife isn’t causing anymore bleeding, it doesn’t mean he’s healed. It doesn’t mean the knife can’t be twisted. But he thought she’d seen it that night they were vulnerable with each other, the first night they’d spent together. 
   Once their breaths evened out, they lay there holding each other.  

   Her head lay on his chest as her fingers danced around his abdomen. He lay on his back with a hand playing with her curls and the other stroking the mudblood scar on her forearm.  

   She let him.  

   Didn’t flinch away.  

   Only relaxed into his touch.  

   And that felt so fucking good. To be able to be this comfortable with the only person he truly likes to be around.  

   “How’ve you been these last couple of years?” she asks suddenly, it’s nearly a whisper said as she squeezed him just a bit tighter against her.  

   He sighed a very little sigh, could’ve been mistaken as just him breathing but he knew it wasn’t.  

   “I’ve been better.”  

   Truth is that this is the lowest he had ever been. He’d been like this for years. And every year he struggled to keep himself alive.  

   He’d tell himself that he had to come see her every May. That he sort of owed her the company her friends couldn’t provide for her.  

   And he told her just that.  

   “We’re very alike.” She lifted her head up to look at him, cupping his jaw and stroking his cheek. “But we’ll be better. We’ll get better.” She kissed him with so much emotion that it nearly made him forget this was their first time doing much of this.  

   “I hope so.” 
His hand supports his body against a wall, as his legs give out on him, forcing him to sit on the floor. Everything. Everything. And now he’s forced to be  here. After fucking everything. Every inch of this place is like a piece of a puzzle, every piece has a significance. It tells a story. It reminds him of all the pretty lies she would tell him, all the beautiful delusions. Because that is what they were: delusions that looked so damn enticing. So fucking beautiful. There’s a memory etched into every crevice, surrounding him, and it suffocates him. It’s an emotional whiplash. In these walls lived the memories of two people that loved each other more than the world around them. They were two people that couldn’t give a damn about anyone else as long as they had each other. 
   Then, he takes his hand from her thigh and reaches to the floor to get the book. He brings it to her and says, “Can you read to me?” He says it so sweetly and it’s something he truly wants. Listening to her speak is music to his ears. 

   She paid attention to every detail just for him. Made it known that she is his. Fucking blew his mind away with everything. What did he do to deserve her? 

   “I’d do anything for you, Draco Malfoy.” It’s a low whisper. Like she doesn’t want anyone else to hear it because this moment is only for them. 

   “I’ll never get over how beautiful you are. I mean look at you.” 

   Her eyes soften. “I wouldn’t ever choose spending Christmas with them over spending it with you. I’d never leave you to spend it all alone.” Her thumb strokes his cheekbone and it soothes the tension that plagued his shoulders. 

   She’s it for him. 

   “Of course I want you to go.” Her eyes were wide with shock. “Baby, I assumed you’d come with me.” 

   She lingered there for a few seconds and while she did so he found his voice and said, “I just didn’t want to spend another Christmas alone.” It was a soft whisper that contained vulnerability. He felt he could be vulnerable with her, felt he could trust her. 

   “My little swot.” He brings his fingers to her cheek and she leans into him. “I’ve got you something.” 

   She skims it really quick, eyes brightening and looking up at him with nothing but adoration. “For my girl. I hope you love it as much as I love you. You’re the prize.You’re my prize.” 

   “I’ll never be good enough, Hermione Granger, but I’ll try for you.” 
They loved, they argued, they cried. But no one could ever deny that they loved each other unconditionally. Outside of these walls were bitter memories. Memories he would do anything to forget. So, so many memories. But the one that stands out the most is the one that shook him to his core.
   But no.  

   No that isn’t the case whatsoever.  

   Because Hermione Granger is in this sex club. And she is being led into one of those private sex rooms by another bloke, and that same bloke has just kissed her lips. 
It’s the freshest one. He cannot. Even thinking of what happened is enough to bring him to tears, enough to shatter his heart all over again, enough to ensure his downfall. There isn’t much to think or to do because he can’t fathom any of it. He knows it happened, knows every detail of the situation, but his mind refuses to accept it. That doesn’t take from the excruciating pain he is in, doesn’t take away the acid in his chest or the crucio that rattles his bones. Like a flash of memory, all of the worst parts of tonight flash in his head. 
   “We — we aren’t together.” 
The firewhiskey burns his mouth, relishing in the simple pain of a drink. He wishes the pain he feels in his heart would feel like the firewhiskey. Maybe then it’d be more manageable. It brings bitter mirth to him thinking about what’s manageable. Because when has the world ever given him something he can handle? He barely makes it out of those rough patches. He’s afraid he might not make it through this one, though. It’s scary being alone with your thoughts, especially when they’re so destructive. It’s a wonder how he manages. 
   “I thought you were doing the same.” 
The wall supports his wracking body, giving him something to lean on as he sobs and drinks his sorrow away. It’s the only way he can attempt to stop feeling like this. Stop feeling like he’s drowning in a pit of his emotions, emotions that he’d covered in a beautiful blanket of Hermione Granger, the love of his life. Now, the blanket has been set on fire, tainting all their memories and love. Making things that were once a pleasure and comfort into poison and deadly. 
   “Two years.” 
His lungs cave in on him, restricting him from gathering a breath. He gasps for a breath, panicked and afraid. A hand on his chest, pressing like it’d do something to ease the pain. It feels like someone repeatedly punches his chest with a knuckle brass. Salty tears fall down his cheeks. His hand shakes so violently he drops the bottle, causing it to shatter and spill all of its contents. All the glass resembles him. 
   “I love you.” 
He slides his hands against his head, wiping the sweat that somehow formed. His body shakes uncontrollably and forces his head against his knees, huddling up into a ball. Breathing becomes something he must fight to have. It won’t fill up his lungs despite his begging. “Please, please, please.” He repeats it like it’s a mantra, like it’ll somehow save him from this agony. “Please. Just please.”He rocks back and forth, his head digs into his knees, squeezing himself tightly together. Every single inch of his body is in pain. He screams, an agonizing scream, filled with the pain he has felt since he was a child, filled with the pain The Dark Lord has caused, filled with the pain of his mothers death, and filled with the torture Hermione Granger has inflicted on him. It’s raw, containing every emotion he has ever felt. All of his magic shot out of him, shattering every single glass in the flat. It startles him and he looks around to see his destruction. Like a saving grace, he sees him. Sees him coming closer. His vision is blurry, but he knows it’s him, knows just fucking knows it. Then, he’s crouching down in front of Draco, a hand on his knee and another on Draco’s tear-stained cheek. His hand is soft and comforting. It’s comfort that he knows he doesn’t deserve. He worries his lip between his teeth, tears glistening in his eyes. He only looks at Theo, just watching as he moves. “Hey,” Theo whispers, wiping the tears that stream down his cheeks. His face is riddled with guilt. And it only makes him sob. “I know, I know.” He sits next to him, bringing Draco’s head to his neck. He melds into him instantly, wounding his hand around Theo and squeezing him tightly against him, sobbing into his neck but relishing into the comfort of him. Theo’s hands comb through his sweaty locks as he whispers words he doesn’t quite hear but appreciates whatever it might be. The glass that was pricking at his skin disappeared, the little fires that his magic caused were put out, his tears and sweat were dried, and a cooling charm was placed on him. Blaise. He’s also here. Doing all of these wonderful things for him. He really didn’t deserve these two And after it all, Blaise sits on the other side of him, throwing an arm around Draco too, and emitting every bit of comfort he can fathom into his friend. They hold him tightly, whispering reassurances and rubbing his back and arms in an attempt to calm the tremors that wrack his body. “You knew. You both fucking knew,” he sobs once he eventually calms himself enough to speak. “Why?” His voice is small and broken.Like they have the same thoughts, they tighten their arms around him and lay their heads on him; Theo’s cheek on Draco’s head, and Blaise’s forehead on his shoulder. Theo sighs. “We knew she was a regular at the club, but we didn’t know the pair of you were together.” A moment of silence comes and goes and he assumes it’s because Theo choked up, probably feeling bad. That’s the kind of person he is. “When you showed us how serious you both were, we thought it was right to show you. Telling you probably would’ve upset you and we didn’t want to lose you for something like this.” Blaise’s voice is just above a whisper. He’s afraid. Draco can hear it in the way his voice shakes. They’re both afraid. Theo and Blaise. 
   February 18, 2006 
Days pass. Many days. He spent those days curled into a corner in his flat since he couldn’t bring himself to sleep in the bed where all those beautiful memories were made. He couldn’t bring himself to be in any other part of the flat either. The corner is his makeshift haven, but only until he figures out what he’s going to do. Blaise and Theo continue to do their best in taking care of him. He knows he’s being difficult, knows that he worries them, but he just can’t bring himself to do anything. It’s pathetic, so fucking pathetic to act this way, but it’s the way his body is reacting. He hates it, hates it so much he wishes there was something he could do to change. Anything. Anything. 
   Please.  

  February 20, 2006
His shoes scuffs the sidewalk, further ruining his expensive shoes. His hands are in the pockets of his hoodie. Slytherin green cotton keeps his shaky hands warm against the frigid air. Walking down an alley only intensifies how cold it is; there’s something eerie about it, something creepy and cruel. He doesn’t care. The walls in his flat suffocate him; he needs some fresh air. He walks carelessly, feeling the air brush against his splotchy cheeks and chapped lips, drying the hot tears that stained his face. He’d heard many stories about this side of town. They were always scary stories that made him listen to his mother when he was a child. 
   “Draco, you know what happens to little boys that misbehave.” A slick, graceful brow raised. “They get taken to —“ 

   “Mum. Mum, no. I’m sorry. I’ll eat. Just please.” 
Looking back now makes him smile. She always took care of him; she would never take him to a place like this. No, she would take him to a beautiful place, like Italy. Shame she never got to visit. The streets are deserted. There isn’t a soul to be seen. He relishes in the quietness, a silence he has been deprived of. His thoughts never give him the satisfaction. Many minutes pass when he sees it: the delicate flicker of fire at the end of the block. He hears laughter and the sound of cans being kicked. It sounds like people are having fun. Curiosity peaks at him. It draws him closer, as if in a trance. He can’t resist. His legs take him closer and closer until he’s able to get a clear view of what’s happening. His brows furrow when he sees it. There’s some bloke there with something in his arm. But Draco’s too far to see what it is. He inches closer to get a look but he can’t unless he wants to be caught. And he doesn’t. Not while he’s unable to fend for himself. He’s weak. He hasn’t been eating, hasn’t been doing anything. And getting into a fight where he can’t use his magic is incredibly stupid.He sighs, admitting defeat and turns to walk away. But he does take another glance at the guy. And — and well he’s staring at him, watching Draco turn away. His face is blank. It makes Draco’s blood run cold. “Oí, white hair!” His voice sounds slurred and it pushes a sigh of relief from his lips. A drunken man won’t be able to do much without any balance. “Come, come.”Cautiously, Draco walks to the bloke, eyes flitting and examining everything around him. He’s alone and that’s about it. He wonders what’ll happen. His curiosity beats his fear and for some reason he thinks this’ll be a good night. Maybe something good will happen to him. When he’s close enough to the guy, he sees a needle on the bench, and the guy is rubbing his arm. That is —“Some send ya?” He’s American. “I’ve only heroin. Next week I’ll be restocked.” Draco notes that this man is rather sloppy when it comes to drug dealing. He didn’t even bother to check if Draco was working with law enforcement. His beard covered nearly his whole face, except his eyes and forehead. His teeth looked deteriorated and his clothes were ragged. He pushes his hands into his trousers, feeling juvenile to have them in his jumper. “Uh, no. Just walking around the block.” His voice is deep and ashy. “At this time?”“Mhm.”“Come here, boy.” He pats the bench, scooting over as if it was necessary. “Why?” He puts something in a little cup-like container and sniffles quietly. “My girlfriend cheated on me.” He breathes out, feeling the brick build up as he said it aloud. It’s the first time he has ever allowed himself to say it, to accept it. “For the entirety of our relationship. Two years.”He thinks he’s over sharing. But this is some muggle he’ll never see again that asked about his life, so he couldn't find it in himself to care all that much. “That fucking sucks.” He sniffles once again, slouching against the back of the bench and looking over at him. “Makes you feel like shit?” He nods, throat restricted from the heavy emotions weighing on him. His chin threatens to shake but he smothers it down. Not now. The guy gives him a pitiful look and clasps a hand on his shoulder. But he doesn’t say anything, only digs into his denim pocket and takes out a little bag. “For a rainy day,” he offers with a drunken smile, a small clear bag between his fingers with a pill in it. “Take this and it should make everything go away.”“It’ll make everything stop hurting?” he asks, desperate for a solution to cure the overwhelming emotions that course through him. “Yes.”This makes Draco think for a moment. Taking something from a stranger isn’t wise nor is taking drugs. But if this could make him feel less like shit then he wants to take his chances. “But don’t take that right now. Take this,” he offers him a needle with clear fluid. It looks well — how a needle looks. Scary. “Don’t be afraid. It’ll take you to heaven.”He’s hesitant for a moment. Studies it. There are so many things that could go wrong but so many things that can go right. He could stop hating himself and feeling like utter shit. He could forget about her. That’s all he wants. To forget. To feel better. And that is why he lets the guy inject him with whatever is in the needle. Why he takes it out enjoys it. And why he laughs when all of the aches leave and the lights turn bright. “Go home. And fucking enjoy. That’s a gift. Girls suck but drugs make it all better.”And so he goes home, lays on the couch, and relaxes for hours. It’s the best few hours he has had in weeks. He would do anything to feel like this everyday. It’s truly amazing. He owes that bloke. Eventually, his high begins to dissipate, and although he is sad about it, he relishes in the fact that he got to feel like this. And that he’ll feel like this again. He’ll make sure of it. “Draco.” It’s murmured and meek. He can hear the tears already. “Baby…”He hadn’t heard her come in. It startles him and turns his blood cold. Seeing her is like being exposed to radiation; it hurts, it burns. “Go away.” His hand slides against his eyes. “I don’t have patience right now.”“Can we please talk?” She pushes her luck, the luck that has clearly been sent to hell. She fiddles with her own fingers, teeth scraping against her bottom lip. “Please.”He leans his elbows on his thighs, bringing his head into his hands and breathing out deeply. He feels drained, doesn’t have the will to fight with her anymore. He just can’t. “Please, just go.”Steps get closer, they’re soft and hesitant, until they reach the front of him. Her hands are placed on his knees and she kneels before him. Memories flash in his eyes of her like this. Happier times. Times that should still be ongoing. She takes one of his hands and places it on her tear-stained cheek. She releases a shaky breath and places her forehead on his. “All I ask is that you listen.“His face contorts and he sobs. He’d been trying to hold it all in but he is too weak. Tears make ivers on his cheeks as the dam he’d been attempting to build gave out on him. He shakes his head, doesn’t know why, but he does. “I know, I know. I know I fucked up.” Her voice is written in tears. “But I need you to know that I love you so much. Unconditionally.”Her words force a sob from his throat. He wishes they could just be happy. But he can’t forget. He just can’t. Not of something like this. She cups his jaw and makes him meet her gaze. She glides her finger under his eyes and wipes his tears, pressing kisses under his eyes as a way to console him. He places his hand on her neck, pressing his head to her more tightly. He misses her touch, misses her breath, her kisses, her everything. “Why’d you do this to us?” It’s wrenched from him, leaving his chest mangled from the saw that ruined him. “Why didn’t you just ask?” he says, voice dripping with sorrow and hand tightening on her neck. “I was afraid of chasing you away. I’d rather have a piece of you than none at all,” she says through her tears, pressing kisses wherever she can. He brings her into his arms, pulling her onto his lap and slipping his into her neck. She melts into him, sobbing into his neck and holding him tightly. He holds her just as tight, entangling his fingers into her curls and just weeping. Their broken relationship cannot be repaired and that is the sad truth. They both know it. They both feel it. And it hurts like hell. “I don’t deserve this, Hermione. Not after everything,” he sobs, heart thumping in his chest painfully. It’s true and he knows it. “I know, baby. And I’m — so — so sorry.”She’s sorry but sorry doesn’t repair his broken pieces. It doesn’t erase what he saw and everything she has done. He wishes it did, though. 
   March 9, 2006

  All of your friends have been here for too longThey must be waiting for you to move on (woo)Girl, I'm not with it I'm way too far goneI'm not ready, eyes heavy nowHeart on your sleeve like you've never been lovedRunning in circles, now look what you've done (woo)Give you my word as you take it and runWish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (woo)
His wand heats the spoon, making the heroin bubble. His nerves tingle with excitement. There’s nothing that could possibly make him this happy, not as much as heroin does. It’s nearly done. Just a few more seconds. It’s been a while since something has alighted his nerves like this. And he is so content with the fact that it’s this, and not another witch that could hurt him so badly. He puts the liquid in a needle, watching closely to ensure nothing spills. It’s too precious to waste. This is his liquid happiness. And he’ll be damned if this isn't the best thing that has ever happened to him. He lifts the needle up, squeezing just a bit to remove the air. He wouldn’t want to make this anymore painful than it needs to be. A blue rubber string is tied above his elbow. He takes the needle and aims it to his vein, taking a deep breath and preparing for the ultimate stinging sensation that’ll invade his nerves. He begins to put pressure on the needle, puncturing the skin, and hissing at the stinging. It goes deep into his arm until there’s blood in the needle. Then, he puts pressure on the top, slowly injecting the liquid into his body. As he does so, the door to his flat opens. In she comes, saying words he doesn’t quite comprehend. But she stops dead in her tracks once she sees the needle in his arm. Her face is blank. And just as quickly, she’s walking towards him, face of disgust etched onto her expression, no words being said. She grabs the needle. “Granger, what the fuck?” It’s rushed out, worry evident in his eyes. “Stop, stop.  Fuck. ” She rips it from his arm, disregarding how painful it is to remove a needle, ignoring his cries and swears, and it is only until he pushes her that she finally looks at him. His vision is blurry, tears threatening to spill. A burning sensation blooms in his arm, encroaching and suffocating him. It hurts. It  hurts.  
   Fuck.  
“Fuck.  Fuck,”  he bellows, brows drawn together as he holds his arm, attempting to soothe the pain. “Why?  Why? ” He groans loudly, finger shaking with rage. “Where did you get this? Draco, do you know how fucking dangerous this is?” She sighs, bringing her hand to her head. His lip twitches. The unadulterated hate he feels for her at this moment is enough for him to want to kill her. He thinks he might. She doesn’t get to fuck him over and then decide to  care.  She doesn’t get to break him into a million fucking fragments then try to control his life when he can barely do it himself. She doesn’t get to do anything. She lost that right. He gets up quickly, towering over her, eyes deadly and looking right into her soul. His face is fucking frightening, he knows because of the way she slightly backs up and cowers under his gaze. He continues to slowly close the space between them, his neck straining as he looks down at her. “What the fuck give you the right to come into  my  home, take  my property?” His voice is deadly, so dead it lacks all emotion. “You are no one.”Her eyes water and her brows raise. “This isn’t how you should be coping with everything that’s happened, baby. This… this is —“Her back hits the wall and her teeth scrape against her lip, hands squeezing into a fist. “You.” He slams his hand against the wall right where her head is. “Don’t get to tell me how I choose to get over you,” he spits, hand colliding with the wall after each word. Her jaw trembles and she places a hand on his chest, against his heart, the heart that still beats for her, but it’s the heart she broke. He shakes his head, eyes never leaving her brown ones. “You don’t get to tell me anything. Not after what you did to me.” His voice is quiet and broken. It hurts to speak. “I love you,” she croaks, her hand traveling to the hand on the wall and wrapping her fingers around it. “I swear.” Tears fall down both of their cheeks. “You don’t. You love being  loved. ” He says harshly. “You love that I worshipped the ground you walked on. You love that attention,” he says, but his voice is barely a croak. She sobs, clinging onto his shirt, and she leans in to press a kiss against his neck. Another, and another. Her lips are rough but gentle. She was always so gentle with him, but he guesses she forgot his heart was what needed the most care. He pushes himself from the wall, making space between them. His back is to her and his hands roughly pull at his locks as he attempts to figure himself out. He’s upset with her but then all he wants is to hold her. She hurts him and he still can’t fucking hate her. “I never meant for any of this to happen.”“Hermione, just go.” He masks his pity for her. “Your friends must be waiting for you to move on. Fucking forget about me.” A brick pieces itself in his throat. “I’m not with it anymore. I’m too far gone.”She cries as she shakes her head. Somewhere along the few moments that passed, she’d broken the space between them. Her arms wrapped around his waist. “ Please. I just — please — I love you.”  She nuzzles her face into his back, crying and holding him tightly  .  Fuck. Just fuck. Nothing can be easy. He turns, grabbing her shoulders roughly and bringing her to his eyes level. He searches her eyes and clings onto her. His face is detached and emotionless. “You  love  me?  You love me?” His voice is filled with incredulity. She continues to repeat it, yet it meant nothing to him anymore. “I hate you.”She shakes her head. “No. You don’t, baby. Don’t say that.”“You wear your heart on your sleeve like you’ve never been loved. Like I haven’t been loving you — this whole time,” he says, voice cracking, eyes tearing up. “I didn’t know. If I did —”“Running in circles. That is what you did. Now look at what you’ve done.” He releases her with a push, throwing his hands up and showing her the flat she has basically lived in for years, though this time there’s a bunch of clutter and needles everywhere. He laughs manically. “Look at me. Look at everything.” Tears flood his eyes. “You’ve ruined me. You ruined my life.” His voice is bitter, so, so bitter. His emotions and tones change so quickly. One moment he’s upset and the next he’s emotional. Fucking whiplash. “Give you my word. I told you I fucking loved you. And you took it and ran. You faked it and ran away.” He passes his hand through his eyes. “You coward.”She never says anything, just stands there crying. She sees how badly she fucked up. How a lack of communication really messed up the one good thing in her life. How she managed to reduce to dust the one thing that kept him alive. He should’ve listened to his father, should’ve been a cold, bitter man, should’ve been a prejudice, pureblood. But she managed to peel back the prejudice, the hate, and coldness. She managed to make him feel more alive than anyone or anything. Love is for the weak. She made him weak. She made him trust her. Then she crushed him. Oh the betrayal. 
   March 14, 2006 
He’s alone. He’s earned it. He did this to himself.  I hate you, he’d said.  Being friends with you was nothing but a burden, he yelled.  Fuck you, he spat.  I wouldn’t miss you if either of you died, so stop giving a fuck if I do, he choked. He had said so many horrible things.  I’m glad your parents disowned you, he sobbed.  I’d be disgusted if my kids turned out like you, he whispered. He didn’t know things like that could even be said to a pair of the sweetest people he’d ever met. They were everything he doesn’t deserve and yet they still stood by him despite everything. They held him as he screamed and cried. They fed him, bathed him, dressed him, and even lay with him until he stopped trembling and fell asleep. Their fingers played with his hair and they rubbed his back. They did more than friends should, more than he deserved. They took more of his shit than anyone would’ve. Yet, he had still said all those things. It feels terrible. It feels like… like pure agony. Blaise and Theo. They deserve better than him. They deserve better than an ungrateful, self-loathing, piece of shit friend. A person who abandoned them when he found a witch to love. A person that managed to obliterate every bit of their friendship.It was the right thing. They could do so much better than him. He was holding them back. He gave them the much needed push they needed. They’re free of the burden that is Draco Malfoy. Now, he is alone, collapsed on the shower floor, with his knees up to his chest, his body trembling, and tears streaming down his face. This is what he deserves. The worst of the worst. And they deserve the best the world has to offer. He’ll love them forever, with his entire heart and soul, and they’ll never know, but — but he does and that’s all he has. 
   March 16, 2006, 6:34 p.m. 
He takes out the needle, rubbing the place where it punchered his skin. The drugs travel through his veins like it missed him for years. The welcoming feeling that encroaches him is nothing short of euphoric. It makes his heart beat faster and his eyes roll back. A groan tumbling from his lips as he relishes in this. Words will never be enough to describe how good this makes him feel, how good it feels to not have to feel a crushing weight on his chest, or have to feel like he can’t get out of bed. It’s a sort of freedom that can’t be described with words. It lights up his nerves, making everything more intense, making him more sensitive. It’s beautiful, really. So, so beautiful. His head falls against the back of the couch, biting his lip and breathing through his mouth. He summons his wand and performs a spell to quicken the effects. He hasn’t any bit of patience. And in that moment a wave passes through him, his heart beats just a bit faster for just a few seconds. He has reached his peak. A loopy smile graces his face. This is the happiest he has ever been. He lays there for just a minute before he begins to fiddle with the strings on his sweats, wrapping a cord around his finger and smothering a smile as he does so. His finger trails lower over his clothes, teasing himself just a little. What’s the fun in getting things quickly just because you can?He cups his cock, squeezing tightly and feeling the tingles of pleasure race up his abdomen and up to his heart. A warmth encompasses him, making his cock stir. A finger comes up to trail his jaw and slither down to his neck. He grips it in his hand, squeezing the way she would. Relishing in the pretty memories they used to have. They’re ugly now. He palms himself slowly, making himself work to feel like he’s on top of the world, like he needs to earn this. She always made him earn his pleasure. It was always his favorite thing. 
   "But there'll be some rules." 
The pleas he’d yell out, tears streaming down his cheeks as she edged him for the fourth time. The overstimulation and the burn of her hand as she punished him for cuming without permission. 
   "I expect so much from you, baby, and disobeying me is not acceptable." 
The memories trigger something in him, making his hand quickly move into his pants and grasping his cock firmly. He’s hard, hard because of the tainted memories of her. It should be wrong to still be able to be turned on by her. It should be wrong to even consider a wank from their memories.When has Draco Malfoy ever cared about what should and shouldn’t be?He strokes himself once, only once, and that is when he remembers he’s home all alone. He can do whatever the fuck he wants. When they were together, he wasn’t allowed to wank unless she gave him explicit permission. She was in charge of his pleasure.  Always. Just as he was of hers.Getting up swiftly and stopping for just a second when he gets dizzy, he hooks his fingers in the hem of his sweats and briefs and shoves them down to his knees, kicking them away from him. He looks down and watches as his hard cock bobs slightly. 
   She takes him in her mouth. Gradually lowers, teases him because she just knows how good her hot mouth and wet tongue feel, knows that he's never felt such delicious pleasure before. 
He rips his shirt off, just the way she would do when she grew too impatient. It was something she would do when he’d start to tease her. So impatient she would tie him up and do anything and everything. Dropping onto the couch, he combs a hand through his hair, making sure to pull. She always loved doing that and he loved it when she did. He spits on his hand, imagining it’s her spit, imagining she’s the one who’s about to touch him, the only who’s about to make his legs quake. He lathers his cock with it. Pretty soft hands that he loves are touching him. They are. His head rests on the back of the couch and he begins to stroke himself. Up and down, up and down, up and down. Just the way her hand would, just the way her head would go. They’re slow strokes, because she would never ever give him something. He would have to suffer and beg until he couldn’t take it anymore. He licks his thumb and pointer finger, bringing it down to his nipple and rubbing it; her tongue would be doing this. She loved to do this to him, loved to see him squirm. The fingers pinch and twist so roughly he makes a choking sound, though he doesn’t release, she wouldn’t. His back arches into his hand, a cry leaving his lips.  “I know, I know. Just a little more… there, there, you see. Felt good, didn’t it?” she’d say, then lave and soothe his nipple with her tongue. The same tongue he’d suck into his mouth. His hand pumps quicker. “Please, fuck. Just please.” He twists and pumps, forcing his legs to shake like it was her who was doing all of these ministrations to him. “Gods,  Granger.” He cups his balls, massaging them ever so slightly, keeping in mind that he’s already susceptible to just the lightest of touches. The knot in his lower abdomen begins to unravel and thoughts and memories of the love of his life begin to flash in his mind, bringing him closer to cuming. Her curls bouncing, bright smile, doe eyes, scarlet cheeks, and everything that is Hermione Granger. Suddenly, everything goes dark and a scream ruptures from his throat, as he cums in his hand. He imagines it’s hers, imagines that she’s kissing his neck and murmuring pretty little things to him. It feels great, feels amazing. But it could’ve been better. His chest rises and falls rapidly, panting and sweat dripping from his temple. It has been a very long time since he had done this. But it was only just a few weeks ago that she had touched him, kissed him, held him. Only a few weeks ago when she told him she loved him and promised him the world. Good times they were. Now he’s stuck here. With a heavy realization with what he has just done, his eyes water and a choking sound escapes his throat. It feels like he is being choked and the only thing that can be heard is his whimpers. He weeps for everything and nothing. Weeps for his broken heart and broken trust. Weeps for his dependency on the drugs when he swore it wouldn’t happen. Weeps for the broken promises and tainted memories. Weeps for it all. 
   7:26 p.m. 

  Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready nowI'm not ready, eyes heavy nowWoo
He stirs in his sleep, a finger stroking his cheek and lips. A blanket was set upon his body. And he hears quiet murmurs and sniffles. He had passed out after all his emotions came tumbling down on him like a tsunami. It was overwhelming and he’d felt like utter shit, more so than usual. It was exhausting, the physical and emotional toll of being in love with her and the aftermath of another high. He goes so high but ends up lower than where he’d started. It’d been months since he felt this bad. It chips at his fragile person. His eyes flutter open and he sees her. Brown curls, chocolate eyes, splotchy cheeks and nose, teeth biting her bottom lip, and a worried expression etched onto her face. He clenches his jaw, she’s a sight for an addict, so beautiful, so soft. He wishes things were different. Waking up to her looking at him is something he wishes had never stopped. Silent moments where there’s no hurt between them are rare, so rare that this is the very first time. Maybe if he could just forget about everything she did, everything she said, they’ll be able to move forward and be together. They would be able to have all of their moments and share the love that burns so passionately through them. But if he could forgive something as treacherous as cheating, then he could forgive Voldemort of killing his mother. He can’t. He fucking can’t. He can’t get over it even if that’s all he wants. Because he cannot look at her. All he sees when he looks into those beautiful brown eyes is all the pain she has caused him, another man getting to do the things he thought only he got to do. She clears her throat. “I found you here, naked.” It’s meek and edges on the cliff of worry. “I thought something happened to you.” She places a kiss on his cheek. His hand fastens on her wrist, pulling her away from him and wiping the kiss from his cheek. He looks at her with contempt but only because he wishes that kiss would’ve been given under another circumstance. Her eyes blur with tears, jaw beginning to tremble uncontrollably. She puts some space between them and visibly swallows. “I’m fine. You can leave.” A very cold tone. Colder than what he’d shown her at Hogwarts. How the times have changed. “I saw the needles and you just laying there and —” Her voice shakes and tears begin to stream down her cheeks. “Draco, I don’t know what I’d do if you died,” she says brokenly. She looks tired. Her under eyes have dark, heavy crescents, her cheeks are hollow, her skin is pale, and she has lost her fire. This isn’t the witch he once knew. “You don’t get to care.” He averts his gaze to the needle on the coffee table. “You gave up that right when you started fucking other guys.”“But… but I always,  always  meant what I said to you —““I’m sure.” He breathes out heavily, wanting to just stick a needle in his vein and fucking forget about this conversation. “Get the fuck out.”“Please, Draco. I — I'm so sorry. Just... just give me another chance. I love you. I always did," she croaks, face wet with tears and red lines form as she creases her face. He meets her sad gaze with a hard stare, fresh with rage and bottled up feelings. He takes her chin in his fingers, making it so that she sees his eyes. "I  can’t. I'm not ready. I'm too far gone," he says voice hard and chest aching as the hammer breaks his diaphragm. The dam that has been threatening to collapse finally does. Unleashes the tears he doesn't want her to see. She places her hands on his wrist and lightly squeezes. "Please. Please, baby.” She sobs in a way he’d never seen before. "I — I'll help you. Please, Draco. I fucking need you."He nods his head lightly, regretting what’s about to slip past his lips. It hurts to admit but it’s true. It’s something that he’d promised himself would never happen.  “And I need the drugs,” he says simply. “It's you or the drugs; I can’t have both, one has to give. And I fucking need the drugs, Granger.” 
  9:19 p.m.

  I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (woo)Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready nowI'm not ready, eyes heavy now (woo)Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (woo)
His eyes flit between all parts of the living room, as he sees the front door open and all he can do is stay. He hears his pulse through his ears, feels how fast it goes then slows down in less than thirty seconds. It’s an odd feeling that makes him want to throw up. She comes running to him, dropping to her knees and dropping a bunch of papers by his side. His eyes follow the papers and just barely he reads the word  rehab in it. Just barely. And he’d seen. She brought him papers to take him to rehab. She’d spent an hour gathering information on rehab to bring to him. But look at him. “Hey, hey, hey.” She’s already in tears, touching his head and feeling the cold of his body. He is so fucking cold, fucking wracking with tremors. “Get up. Get up. Fucking, Draco,  get up. ”When she finally understood how deeply into the drugs he was, she accepted it. She’d stayed quiet for a few minutes, lost in her thoughts and wouldn’t look him in the eyes. 
   “Okay,” she’d said, but he heard how much it hurt to hear him say that with only a word that she’d uttered. “I love you.”  
Then she’d left. And he’d injected himself with a needle, relishing in how much it hurt when it broke his skin.  But it was like he’d grown accustomed to it or something. Because it didn’t make the throbbing sensation in his heart  stop.  
   That’s all he fucking wanted.  

   “For a rainy day,” he offered with a drunken smile, a small clear bag between his fingers with a pill in it. “Take this and it should make everything go away.” 

   “It’ll make everything stop hurting?” he asked, desperate for a solution to cure the overwhelming emotions that course through him.  

   “Yes.” 
So, he’d summoned some firewhiskey, and swallowed the pill. Then, he drank all of the firewhiskey. He chugged it and the burning made him forget for just a minute. A minute of heaven. So he did it again. And again. Till he had to use the loo, till he got up and collapsed onto his back, till he couldn’t get up, till she found him like this. It's not that he wants to turn to this. Drugs. But the world has treated him poorly and there's only so much he can take. He covered all of his burdens in the comfortable and secure blanket that was Hermione Granger. Now it has been ripped and everything is flooding and overwhelming him. He tried. He really did. But letting himself finally be happy and be content with his life and with his person is only the climax of his story. Because it ends with him being left to pick up the broken pieces and dust of his own downfall, caused by everyone. “Shh. Stay with me. Stay. Don’t go. Don’t you dare leave.” She’s frantic and shaking violently, trying to turn him or get him up. Drugs were never a part of the plan, yet it became the only way. And now he’s paying the price with his life. It’s hard to breathe, sometimes he can take in gulps of air and other times he can barely suck anything in. A croaking sound escapes his lips. She conjures a cloth and dries his temples of sweat. But only more comes down. Her wand is in her hand, fingers trembling as she summons something. He doesn’t know but he does know how it looks to summon. “Help is coming. You’ll be okay, my love. We’ll be okay.” She strokes his cheeks and presses kisses to any place she can. “We’re gonna fix us. We’re going to get married. We’ll have kids and we’ll grow old together.”He gasps for breath, seeing his vision darken at the sides. His eyes roll back at the excruciating pain that plagues his body. “You’re okay. You’re okay. I love you.” He has never seen her like this. It makes him scared. Will this be the end?His head softens and rests on its side and her hand comes to his cheek. “Stay with me. Don’t leave me. You’re not allowed to. Please, baby.”He fights to keep his eyes open but the heaviness of his eyelids is difficult to fight. “ Fuck. Why haven’t they come yet?” she yells at the gods, facing the roof and clinging onto him like if she let go, she would lose him forever. He forces his hand up, forcing himself to lightly wipe her tears. Even with all the pain she has caused him, he still loathes seeing her cry. She’s too beautiful to be crying. His lips part to speak, but a croaking sound is all that escapes. But when he finally manages to get it out, she nearly collapses from grief as she sobs in the most earth-shattering way, though he doesn’t see her expression because his eyes have already lost their fight. “I… l-love you,  my golden snitch. ”
