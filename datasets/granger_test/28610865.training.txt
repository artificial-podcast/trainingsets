It was a turbulent period in history when James and Lily Potter had their first and only child, and some might have argued that it was rather irresponsible to bring a child into a world that was being ravaged by war. Some would quietly claim that they should have waited until after the fall of the Dark Lord who was, at the time, doing his utmost to destroy every pillar and foundation of magical society in an attempt to plunge the entire world into chaos and anarchy. There were even a few whispered comments from their closest friends that the two were being quite selfish and that they should have thought of what would happen to the child if they were to be killed or incapacitated, given that they had repeatedly opposed the Dark Lord already and were currently sitting at both the number one and two spots on his list of eye-twitching annoyances. They never did quite find out which one of them was actually at number one in the end, however they debated about it frequently and James especially enjoyed creating a playful competition for the coveted (or for those who were sane; feared) spot at the top of the Dark Lord’s kill list. They were Gryffindors after all; they didn’t spend seven years in the ‘House of the Courageous’ at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry without learning a thing or two about reckless and brash behaviour. When they had learned of Lily’s pregnancy however, the couple were forced to abandoned their guerrilla warfare tactics and bold battles with Death Eaters, focusing instead on keeping Lily, and their child, out of harms way. It was difficult for both of them to do, however James especially found his wand-hand itching whenever he read the ever-darkening news of the magical world. It took more than a few words of comfort and reassurance from his wife to keep him from charging off into the frontlines once again and it was merely the knowledge that he needed to protect his child, who was peacefully growing inside of his beloved wife, that caused him to keep his feet planted within their charming little cottage.Despite what may have been said about the two young adults and their boldness (or perhaps recklessness), one thing that was never even remotely considered by any who knew the couple was the idea of their child growing up in an unloving or uncaring home. James and Lily had already begun to lavishly pile love and affection upon the future heir (or heiress) to the Potter line while still in the womb; before Lily was even six months into her pregnancy, the child had a spot reserved and paid for at Hogwarts and James had already excitedly begun preparing his quidditch lessons and training regime, while Lily would lovingly caress her growing belly with fondness and excitement. The magical world may have been in a state of civil war, and the Potters placed deep in hiding from it, however that didn’t stop the couple from dreaming of the world they had been fighting for and eagerly planning exactly how their child was going to grow up when the Dark Lord was defeated.Unfortunately the Dark Lord wasn’t defeated before the birth of their child, as they had hoped, yet they were still in awe of the life that they had created regardless. They had realised prior to their child’s birth that it would be a home delivery, conducted in secret away from the eyes and ears of the Dark Lord’s spies, and they were protected by some of the most powerful charms that the magical world had ever seen, courtesy of Albus Dumbledore. Now that the Potters were in hiding to protect their child, the aging (though powerful) headmaster of Hogwarts was the only other living thing standing between the Dark Lord and his domination. Dumbledore was far more powerful in magical ability than the Dark Lord was and everyone knew it, yet it was also well known that he was getting older, slower and frailer. The Dark Lord had all the time in the world and he knew it, while Dumbledore was sitting squarely on a ticking clock that reminded him constantly of his own mortality. With a surprising sense of patience, the Dark Lord had managed to avoid Dumbledore entirely during the war and instead used his followers to strike at places of importance before retreating from the battle when a fatigued Dumbledore would arrive. The Dark Lord may not have been able to best Dumbledore in a duel, but with how he played the battlefield; he didn’t have to. Where once James and Lily would show up to heroically save the day and best the Dark Lord’s elite, now it was up to Dumbledore to be everywhere at once and he simply could not be. With one side having far superior numbers and complete control of the board, it was an inevitability that either through time or strategy, the Dark Lord would eventually win out in their little game for control of society. James knew this and he crumpled newspaper after newspaper in his hands; day after day, week after week.On the eve of the 31st of July 1980, inside their cosy little cottage with a medi-witch who had been sworn to secrecy, Lily and James held their newborn daughter and cried tears of joy.“You are the brightest star in this; the darkest of nights,” Lily whispered through her fatigue to her daughter as she cradled the newborn child in her arms, “I love you so much.”James simply stared down at his daughter and felt a pure, unequivocal desire to protect this child from anything and anyone that would seek to harm her. He had never felt anything like it; he knew that he loved Lily and he knew that he loved his friends, but as he stared down into the small, delicate, beautiful face before him, he realised that he hadn’t truly known what love actually was until now.A year passed by before their eyes as their daughter rapidly grew, to their immense pride and joy. She advanced faster than they had expected; magical children tended to mature at a much faster rate than non-magical children however their daughter was something else entirely, even by magical standards. She was clearly intelligent and creative, even at her very young age, which caused no shortage of pride from James who puffed every time she demonstrated any kind of creative thinking.On the 31st of October, the two were alerted that the protective wards on their cottage had finally failed as the Dark Lord comfortably strolled through the barrier, courtesy of a certain friend of theirs who had enabled his entrance. Neither James nor Lily knew why the Dark Lord had suddenly been able to walk right into their front yard, despite not having been able to find them for over a year, however they didn’t exactly have time to question it.“He’s here!” James cried out to Lily from the front door as Lily scrambled to her feet in the living room, “take her and go! I’ll hold him off!”Lily turned and ran for the upstairs bedroom with fear pounding in her heart, stumbling slightly over the first few steps as she went. She reached the landing at the top of the stairs and burst into their daughters room, startling the girl who had been sleeping rather peacefully. The sounds of loud explosions and unsettling crackles in the air echoed up the stairs and brightly coloured flashes of light illuminated the entire house like terrifying bursts of lightning in a raging storm. The sound of the fighting didn’t terrify Lily however, nor did the flashing lights. What terrified Lily was the sudden cessation of noise as the sounds and lights stopped almost as soon as they had begun.“No…” she gasped out as she looked back to the bedroom door, knowing within her heart that James would have never stopped fighting, not while he still had a single breath in his body left. She knew what that meant, even as she denied it vehemently to herself.The floorboards outside of the bedroom creaked slightly and Lily knew that she would not be able to make it out in time, not through the doors. She placed a hand on her daughters arm and closed her eyes, however she realised that there was an anti-apparation ward around the house, preventing her escape. The sound of footsteps behind her let her know that her time was up and she simply turned to her daughter in her crib, who seemed quite aware that something was not right. Lily smiled fondly at the unusually intelligent girl, even as a single tear spilled from her eyes.“You’ve always been so smart,” Lily whispered as she stroked her daughters cheek, gazing down into the emerald green eyes that were so similar to her own, “you are so clever. Now I need you to be brave too. I need you to be strong.”A noise behind her alerted Lily to the fact that she was no longer alone in the room and with one last squeeze of her daughters cheek, she stood to her full height, turning slowly to face her husband’s killer.“You will never win,” she said simply to the cloaked figure that towered over her within the colourful and warm bedroom. The dark and imposing presence was starkly out of place within the childish and slightly silly environment that had little moving snitches painted on the wall and brightly coloured books in all directions. Lily took one last look around the place that she had so lovingly crafted with James over the last year; this room was the home of everything that they valued, and not a penny was stored within it.“You will meet your end. If not by my hand, then by the hand of another,” she said flatly.“There is no end,” the cloaked figure said coldly, “for I am legendary, and legends never die.”“You aren’t a legend,” Lily said with a humourless laugh as she stared into the bright scarlet eyes before her, “you are a ghost that is still walking among the living. You are already dead, you just don’t know it. But you will.”The cloaked figure responded only with two words and upon completion of those words, Lily Potter lay crumpled in front of her daughters crib. She let out one final breath as the world was stripped of one the greatest witches that it would ever hold, and one of the greatest mothers that it would never know. She departed the world to find her husband in the great beyond, leaving behind a confused girl who simply stood in her crib, holding onto the small side rails to support her wobbly legs.The cloaked figured peered down at the child in the crib who stared back with wide, innocent eyes.“Nothing personal,” he said quietly to the girl, “but only I can live forever.”Without hesitation, he cast the same spell that had just ended both her mother and father, pointing his long, black wand down at the child without mercy. Without compassion. Without regret. The girl raised a confused hand in his direction, opening her palm out to him at the very last moment. Was it a sign of surrender? Defiance? Perhaps even forgiveness? The Dark Lord did not know.What he did know was that it was the last thing he saw before he was ripped from his body in the most painful experience of his life. He screamed and thrashed wildly as pure agony terrorised his every nerve and every sensation. It was as though hot knives were piercing his body while his skin burned from the fire of a dozen suns. He could feel his very mind being destroyed as his body crumpled and he was ejected like a virus or a plague; expelled as mere unneeded waste to be disposed of. He no longer knew where he was, nor if he was even alive or dead, as he was cast away from his former body and sent screaming out into the night. He fled in no particular direction, not even knowing how he was traveling or where he would go, simply knowing that he needed to be anywhere that this girl was not.He had been a legend mere moments ago, yet in one fell swoop, he was now nothing but a ghost.The child simply stared at the strange occurrences that were happening in front of her eyes. She did not know what was going on; she had been contentedly asleep and having a rather pleasant dream about strange, flying, winged balls that needed catching when all of a sudden she had been rudely awoken and now, two people lay on the ground outside of her crib, unmoving.To add to her confusion, another man that she did not know entered her room a moment later; a man with long, black hair and a large, sharp nose. He looked rather funny to her, however there wasn’t anything overly amusing about the way he fell to his knees as he observed the scene and sobbed tears of raw pain and anguish. The man, weeping openly, crawled forward and cradled Lily’s body as sorrow and regret poured forth from his very soul. She could almost see the energy pouring out from him and she reached out towards him with her palm open, but once again, she was denied as the man ignored her completely. At the sound of a loud crack from outside the cottage, the man suddenly got to his feet and wrapped himself in a strange cloak, disappearing from view entirely.How bizarre.While her tiny mind was struggling to comprehend what was happening, another person entered her room shortly after the first man had disappeared. This man also had long, black hair and this man was also crying openly as he entered, however he did not cradle Lily’s body as the first one had, nor did he pour the same kind of energy out into the room. He simply cried over the scene for a moment until the child found herself being abruptly lifted from her crib by this strange man and she began to cry; he was unfamiliar, he stank of smoke and he had a strange beard. It was all too much for her but she could do little more than loudly complain about what was happening in the only way that she knew how. A strange rumbling that came from outside only served to confuse and overload her senses even further.Her cries were ignored and she was swiftly taken outside, however she became aware of a very large man who was blocking their path through the front yard of the cottage. Broken pieces of glass and wood lined the formerly beautiful garden as the front half of the cottage had been blown outwards during the violent struggle between James and the Dark Lord, however the large man simply trampled all over it without concern, knowing that the state of the garden-bed was not his priority right now.“Sirius,” he said gruffly, “I’m here on Dumbledore’s orders. Gotta take the girl back to ‘im.”“Hagrid,” the man who was carrying her spoke at last, “she… she has no-one else… I’m her godfather… I promised them I would look after her…”“You gotta trust Dumbledore,” Hagrid said softly, “he knows what to do with her. What do you know about lookin’ after a kid? Think about what’s best for her.”The man who was carrying her, Sirius, laughed at that, and he turned the girl around in his hands to look at her for a moment.“I’ll see you soon kiddo,” Sirius said with a teary laugh, “I just gotta do something important first and then I’ll be back. Promise.”He reluctantly handed her over to the large man, who wrapped her in a rather fluffy blanket. It was quite warm and cosy, and the very fatigued girl found herself slowly drifting off to sleep, her right palm held open loosely with a deep, star-shaped scar displayed in the middle.

Albus Dumbledore truly believed that he was making the right decision when he left the girl on the doorstep of the Dursley residence later that evening. After spotting the very distinctive scar on the child’s hand and understanding what it meant, Dumbledore knew without a shadow of doubt that he could never again rely on the Fidelius charm to protect her. He had been reluctant to delve into any form of dark magic in the protection of the Potters and he knew now that it had cost Lily and James their lives. He knew far more about magic than most and he knew that if he had of cast the blood wards that James and Lily had both asked him about, it would have protected them against anything, even the Dark Lord Voldemort. Blood magic was dark and dangerous however, it was widely known, and rather than risk such magic he had reassured them that the Fidelius charm would protect them and keep them safe instead. He had put all of his faith entirely in the good nature of humanity, using loyalty and love as the strongest line of defense against the darkness by tying the Potters fate to that of their close friend, Peter Pettigrew. He had of course been planning on doing so with Sirius Black as the Secret Keeper, however Sirius raised a rather excellent point that he would be a clear and obvious target, while many did not even know that Pettigrew had been one of their closest friends at all.He shook his head at his own foolishness as he reached down and painlessly drew a drop of blood from the sleeping child with his wand. He levitated the drop of blood through the air and placed it on the front door; sealing it in with a powerful curse that would ensure her safety, so long as she called that place home. It was entirely dark magic at its core, however as he mourned the passing of Lily and James within his mind, he realised that he must be willing to do whatever was necessarily to protect this child from any further harm. He had failed to protect her parents and he owed it to her to ensure that she, at least, got to grow up and experience a world without Voldemort, just as her parents wanted. She would grow up in an ordinary home with her non-magical relatives; she would live a normal, peaceful life until the time came for her to attend Hogwarts and when the time came, he would honour her parents reservations of her place within the hallowed castle walls.He rang the doorbell and disappeared from sight, hovering only for long enough to see that the child was safely taken indoors.“Do you think this is wise?” Professor McGonagall asked the headmaster, “these people are awful. I’ve been keeping an eye on them.”“She is family,” he said confidently, “and besides… she is well protected within those walls; even from them. She will never have any harm befall her while in their care and they will do their utmost for her, I assure you.”He was completely and utterly right; the girl was well looked after for the entirety of the time that she was with the Dursley family. They fed her, changed her, wrapped her in new blankets and gently patted her on the back, even as they drove out of town and left her with Vernon’s cousin, who was a highly successful businessman and had controlling interests in several major companies. Naturally, the man was exceeding wealthy and highly-organised so the child was clearly better off in his care than their own, when they only had Vernon’s meagre salary to look after two adults and two children with. To the Dursleys, it was objectively the right thing to do by the girl.It seemed that Dumbledore was right in the end and that the Dursleys did everything in their power to give the girl a better life. Such was the twisted nature of dark magic and Dumbledore simply continued with his own life for the next ten years, blissfully unaware that James and Lily’s daughter was not, in fact, at number four, privet drive.Unsurprisingly Vernon’s very wealthy cousin, who had more money than he knew what to do with, had very little interest in looking after a child that was not his own. After discovering the child at the gates of his estate, he had one of his staff escort the child to the house of his sister in law, as he knew that she had miscarried last month. Unfortunately, the woman struggled to think of any way that he could have been more insensitive and so she took the baby to the first orphanage she could find, before returning home to angrily shout down the telephone at the man about the thoughtless and unwanted act.So it was that the beloved daughter of the Potters was found on the doorstep of a run-down old orphanage on the outskirts of London. She was found by the Matron; an old, world-weary widow, who simply pursed her lips at having had yet another child dumped upon them. Did people not know the nightmare that was involved in attempting to leave a child like this? There was paperwork, legal proceedings, medical costs… as if she didn’t have enough trouble and children on her hands already.The orphanage was one of the last of a dying breed; as legal conditions began to tighten, more and more orphanages were being shut down in place of ‘foster parenting’ or ‘care homes’. The Matron, Beatrice, was entirely on board with the program and was more than happy to give the children into the state’s care for rehousing, however, for all of the ‘lip service’ that the government gave about their dedication to putting children into loving foster homes, they were rather slow at actually taking the children off her hands or giving them anywhere else to go. It was all well and good to determine that children should be with their own loving carers by law, yet most people still wanted their own flesh and blood, not to adopt some stranger’s child and in order to house children in the ideal situation, money was required. A lot of money; a lot more money than people were actually willing to part with, even though they supported the ‘idea’.She had heard it all before; people supported adoption in theory because it made them feel superior as human beings, but they just ‘didn’t want to adopt themselves’. The children were obviously damaged from abuse, or had bad genetics because their parents were clearly meth-heads, or didn’t have the right hair colour that they wanted, or the right skin colour, or eyes, or body proportions…Beatrice could do little more than scoff whenever people spouted propaganda at her about modernising foster homes. She had almost two dozen children within her care of all ages and for the three that had been adopted in the last two years, she had gained six more. Seven now, including this one. She couldn’t even lie to the older children anymore and was rather brutally honest about the fact that if they were over the age of ten, they were probably not going to be adopted anymore and had best start thinking about what they were going to do when they turned eighteen. It was a horrible fate, and she was all too aware of the children’s plight, but there was little more she could do than give them a roof and whatever she could afford to give them with their measly donations and grants (that were themselves at risk of disappearing in favour of these elusive ‘care homes’ that were spoken of, yet never actually seen).On the positive side, a very young child tended to be a lot easier to unload onto new parents so she had that going for her, even if it meant that it had just reduced the chances of adoption for every other child in the building. An unfortunate truth, but, a young child offered the promise of potential; you didn’t yet know whether it would be tall, or pretty, or funny. A young child offered the dazzling promise of all of those things that prospective parents desired, while an older child had already removed the charming ideal of potential by existing as they were. How dare they.Her thoughts were interrupted and she did a double-take; were her eyes mistaken or was the child, who was formerly on the top step, now down at the bottom? How did it get there?She shook her head, she must have been mistaken. The stress was clearly getting to her.“Let’s see, do you even have a name?” she wondered aloud as she moved down to pick up the child who was surprisingly sleeping quite peacefully in her bundle of blankets, despite the chilly morning air. Her exposed (and rather cute) little nose was even warm to the touch, which was rather odd.“Of course, no note, no money… always the same…”With no other choice, Beatrice simply sighed and took the child back inside with her, along with the newspaper that she had actually gone out to collect in the first place. She laughed as she realised that the postman would have seen the child and casually ignored it.What a charming world they lived in.“What are you chuckling about, Beatrice?” A young woman asked with a slight smile as she mopped the floors in the entrance hall of the old building. She had beautiful auburn hair and a warm nature about her, even as she sloshed away with a very old mop and some water that didn’t look any cleaner than the floors she was attempting to improve. The only charming thing about the floor was the smile of the woman who was mopping it.“Oh, nothing dear, don’t trouble yourself with the thoughts of this old woman,” Beatrice said with a wave of her hand. The young woman, Sarah, was a new addition to her team and had started volunteering just last week at the orphanage. Beatrice was not in a position to turn any help down, although she clearly pointed out to the young woman that she was unable to pay her and would probably never be able to do so. It hadn’t troubled her at all however as she had simply said that she wished to help the children. Beatrice occasionally got ‘good samaritans’ like her coming through, however none stuck around for more than a few months at best; once they realised that the work they were doing hardly ever led to actual positive outcomes they tended to move on to something that felt more rewarding, like community firefighting or putting band-aides on people at festivals.“Here, take this,” Beatrice said airily, “I think it needs changing.”Sarah’s eyes widened as she realised that Beatrice was holding out a bundle of blankets that looked suspiciously like-“Is, is that a-”“A headache is what it is,” Beatrice huffed, “we’ll need to report this immediately. The police can do a check to see which births occurred that match her age and who knows, they may get lucky and find something that stands out.”“And if they don’t?” Sarah asked, shocked at what she was seeing.“Then we have another mouth to feed it seems,” Beatrice said, rather annoyed at the thought.Unfortunately for Beatrice, it turned out that James and Lily Potter’s daughter was not easily found in the muggle databases and, with no name or knowledge of who she was, the police were rather baffled about what to do with the child now.“I’m not really sure what we do here,” one of the officers admitted to the other quietly, though Beatrice’s hearing was a lot sharper than people gave her credit for, “don’t we have to fill out a form-eight for this? Take protective custody of the child?”“Can’t consider it a missing child if no-one has reported it,” the other officer countered, “and what are we going to put on the form? It doesn’t have a name and we have zero details about it. We could file it as child abuse, but we have no-one to charge. These cases can take years to get sorted in the courts,” he added with a small sigh, “especially for one with no identification.”“I have a solution,” Beatrice said, interrupting the two, “how about I just take the child back, find an appropriate carer and have her adopted with some creative paperwork. I bet I can get this girl to a family within a few weeks, given her age. All I need you to do is to create a file that gives her a date of birth and an ID of some kind, so that I can use it as a reference to fudge through adoption forms later. No-one is going to look closely into something like this, don’t worry. No-one ever does.”The offices looked at each other for a moment.“Or,” Beatrice said pointedly, “you can send this child down the legal rabbit-hole of which she will never come out of by attempting to submit a report of having found an unidentified child, and effectively ruin her chances as she will probably be several years old by the time your department has finished chasing its own tail and the courts have had their back and forth. What’s it going to be for this little one? Adoption? Or state-ownership?”Fifteen minutes later, Beatrice strolled from the police station with a child that now had a very vague file on record of her birth. She had been given a randomly selected name and a randomly selected date of birth by the two officers for the file and only Beatrice knew it for the paperwork; however she elected not to share it and in the end, she took that secret with her to her grave.“Why not give her a name?” Sarah asked when Beatrice explained that the child was to stay with them in the hopes of adoption, and that she was to remain nameless for now.“This little one will be in and out of here, given her age,” Beatrice explained, “it’s a benefit not having a name; prospective parents will be far more drawn to the idea of giving her their own name. It makes her feel more like their own child. Trust me, it’s very effective. People do it with puppies all the time.”“Yeah but this is a little girl…” Sarah said slowly.“... that we are trying to get adopted out,” Beatrice finished, “whatever works.”Sarah had to begrudgingly agree that in a twisted way it did make sense, but she felt rather bad for simply called her ‘the child’ or ‘the girl’. Despite electing to avoid giving her a name just yet, Sarah couldn’t help but grow attached to the young girl anyway. She was remarkably quiet, incredibly easy to entertain and had the most beautiful emerald green eyes that Sarah had ever seen. Her black hair was surprisingly long and thick for such a young child and it almost seemed unnatural, yet it was quite charming in its own way. Sarah knew that it was a terrible idea to grow overly fond of the young girl but, she simply couldn’t help it. The girl was an absolute delight to be around.As time went on, both Sarah and Beatrice began to notice that there was more unusual things about the girl than just her luscious hair or excellent behaviour. Beatrice had been holding the girl in the lobby one afternoon, who had been completely empty handed, when she looked down once again to see that the girl was suddenly holding a toy car. Beatrice had no idea where she had gotten the car in the first place since they didn’t have choking-hazard toys in the building as a flat-rule. Besides, unless the girl had extendable-arms, there was no way she could have reached the floor or desk to pick it up. It was slightly unsettling but she did her best to brush it off. Sarah had her own odd experiences with the girl as she noticed the flowers in every room becoming more lively and visibly brightening whenever she walked past them with the girl in her arms. They sometimes even changed their position entirely, which was incredibly disturbing. It wasn’t that unusual for plants to change in order to follow the source of sunlight or to avoid certain temperatures, however it was very unusual in the orphange since all of the plants were fake and shouldn’t have been doing anything at all, in any capacity, ever.Beatrice continued to grow more and more concerned about the child’s behaviour and odd occurrences over time, however she didn’t think that she had anything to fear as the girl was quiet and rather friendly, with beautiful eyes and an infectious smile. It didn’t take long until there were soon several prospective parents that were interested in adopting her, to Beatrice’s immense relief. Unexpectedly, Beatrice found herself being in the unusual position of having to narrow down her choices of prospects, although the couples were only interested in the bubbling young girl and didn’t even bother to look at any of the older children at all.Everything went smoothly with a few couples that she picked out; background checks were cleared, proper forms were filed (with some creative problem-solving when it came to the girl’s details) and everyone absolutely adored the quiet, young and friendly girl……right up until they had their ‘meetings’ with her.In order to finalise any adoption, it was required that the prospect parents had several ‘meetings’ with the child, in order to get to know them better and to ensure that both were a good fit for each other. They were supervised by Beatrice and were usually harmless bond-building exercises like playing with blocks together, or reading a book together. It was an important process for the older children who were capable of forming their own opinions, however for a girl this young it was more of a formality than anything else.Unfortunately, the formalities all turned rather sour as there were many strange things that happened at each ‘meeting’. As soon as the child got excited or began to play, bizarre occurrences would happen; blocks would float in the air, lights would flicker on or off and crayons would start to draw on the walls of their own accord. It was an utterly terrifying experience for both Beatrice and the prospective parents, only made worse by gleeful cackles of laughter coming from the young child as she happily played with her toys.“She’s cursed!” the final couple yelled at Beatrice as they hurried for the door, “she’s evil!”“No, she’s just…”Beatrice didn’t even have the heart to disagree anymore, as she wasn’t sure that she actually did.After she had exhausted all of the best applicants, Beatrice was forced to accept some of the more ‘questionable’ parents who had come seeking the girl. Even those prospects quickly fled however, and it didn’t take long before the girl had developed something of a nasty reputation for herself. The other children did little to aid the girl; they would eagerly spread the rumours to anyone they met or would casually let slip that the girl had been through a dozen prospects already, and that she clearly had something wrong with her that was stopping her adoption.Beatrice was forced to reluctantly come up with a more permanent home for the child as it became clear that no-one was interested in adopting the ‘demon-child’ as she was starting to be known as. It was admittedly rather scary for Beatrice to be under the same roof; she had lived her life by the word of God and found herself being torn between a desire to help the charming and misunderstood child and a desire to dump the demonic child on another orphanages door in fear of retribution from above. The child had never actually harmed anyone and had only ever looked at Beatrice with a fond or playful expressions, which only served to confuse her more. ‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’ was a little harder to enforce when faced with an apparently demonic, yet very friendly and rather cute, orphaned child. Against her better judgement, she prayed for forgiveness and squeezed an old, decrepit crib into one of the bedrooms that housed another younger girl. The girl wasn’t particularly happy about it, but, what else was Beatrice to do?And so the only daughter and sole heiress to the line of Potter began her strange journey in the orphanage where she would spend the next ten years learning about life, and how she hated it. As the young child lay in her cold crib by a dusty and broken window, she stared up into the sky and saw a shooting star dart past, winking to her slightly as it bid her farewell, good luck and goodnight, before fading into the dark and falling to earth, with none aside from the drowsy child in the crib being aware that it had even fallen at all.

Beatrice often came across as a very stern matron on the outside and many of the children at the orphanage feared her, despite the fact that she kept them fed and clothed when no-one else would. She found it very unfair, however it was only natural behaviour for the children to fear her whenever she shouted at them in anger or when she cried in frustration; they didn’t understand what she was going through in order to simply keep the lights on and food on the tables, what meagre food that it was. They were children at the end of the day, and Beatrice had never been particularly adept at expressing her feelings with other adults, let alone communicating complicated sentiments to young minds. Still, she believed that she was adequately expressing her affection for the children by ensuring that they continued to have a home to live in, especially as time passed and Sarah, like all of the others, eventually moved on to other things. Beatrice didn’t begrudge her; Sarah had apologetically explained that she had been offered a lucrative position in Paris and would be departing shortly, but Beatrice had waved her off entirely, telling her to go and make something of herself somewhere else. With no others volunteering their time or energy, Beatrice was forced to make do on her own and her stress level increased dramatically with the doubled work load and the new problems that she was facing.Aside from the essentials that were required in order to survive, there was one other precious commodity that was in short supply and high demand; space. Something that, unfortunately, the new resident ‘demon-child’ required a lot of.The girl was only small, of course, and occupied very little space directly. She could have easily fit into any of the bedrooms that were available at the orphanage, or bunked with any number of people, were it not for the unfortunate fact that she had a slight problem; whenever she shared a room with another child, her strange powers began to affect them in many ways and it made sharing a room almost impossible. It had been smooth sailing for a few days as the girl simply spent her time quietly laying in her crib, staring up at the sky through the broken window of the run-down room she shared with another girl, who was seven years old. The older girl had even commented to Beatrice how eerily quiet the new girl was, which was a relief as Beatrice had worried that the young child would disturb the older girl regularly.The good times didn’t last however and after tossing and turning for an hour, the seven year old suddenly awoke and positively screamed the orphanage down in fear at the things she was seeing. Naturally Beatrice arrived in her oversized nightgown and hushed the child to sleep, reassuring her that it was just a nightmare, yet when the same thing occurred three times over the next hour, she realised that this wasn’t a simple nightmare at all. Beatrice was quick to figure out that it must have been the presence of the child and so she tried several things; she tried creating a wall between the two with hanging sheets cast down the middle of the room, she tried soothing both girls before bed, she tried providing a night light and more. Nothing seemed to settle either girl however and night after night, screams would shake the foundations as terrifying and traumatic images were sent rocketing through the older girl’s brain, courtesy of the completely unaware ‘demon-child’ she shared a room with. The older girl was soon babbling about green lights, explosions and hooded monsters, and she had become too afraid to even go to sleep at all.By the time her third birthday rolled around (not that anyone knew it was) Beatrice had long since given up on the idea of combining the child with others and had given her a room all to herself. While it sounded nice at first, it did absolutely no favours for the child when it came to the bitterness the other children had begun to feel. A new arrival at an orphanage was never popular, especially one that was younger than the existing residents. The children were smart enough to know that the youngest child among them was the most likely to be adopted first, yet when the new arrival was also given special treatment, purely because she had an unnatural ability to torment the others who attempted to sleep in the same room as her, bitterness soon gave way to anger and eventually, outright hatred. Beatrice knew what the other children were thinking and saying about the new arrival, however she could do nothing about it and even she had to admit herself that the other children did have valid points; it was rather unfair on them no matter which way you looked at it.Beatrice had tried, Lord knows she tried, to get get the girl adopted quickly. It was the best solution for everyone (the girl included) to get her out of there as soon as possible. Yet, she was growing at an unusual pace and she had already started to look much older than she was. She was rapidly progressing beyond the age that was highly popular and was starting to become harder and harder to find potential parents for, even when Beatrice had lowered her (already low) standards. Worse still, the girl had not only begun to talk, but had taken to forming disturbingly well constructed sentences that sounded rather disconcerting when spoken by a small child. It was admittedly adorable at first when the small child asked something like, ‘could you tell me the time, please?’ yet it hadn’t taken long to progress into more complicated comments or questions that were simply unsettling. When she had asked two prospective parents, ‘do you know why I am here?’ it had proven too much for them and they had bolted for the door, never to return. Of course, there was also the fact that she had asked the question while the lights flickered, children’s books swirled in the air around her head and two blocks clapped loudly against each other in the corner; it did make for an understandably upsetting experience.The girl had reached four years old when she had her first experience with the ire of the other children. She had been planning to enjoy her wholesome breakfast of a piece of stale bread and a slightly soft apple (the standard fare at the orphanage) when a much older boy had taken the apple straight out of her hands. He was quite imposing as he was rather stocky and had short orange hair, with freckles that lined the bridge of his nose and an ugly expression upon his face.“I wanted to eat that,” she said with a frown, not understanding why he had taken it. It was her apple, why had he taken it? He already had an apple, lodged firmly in his other hand.“Yeah well I wanted a good nights sleep but I’m forced to share with THREE other boys now,” he said aggressively as he bit down onto her apple, “if you didn’t occupy the entire top floor with your weirdness, we would all have space to ourselves.”“I don’t have a whole top floor,” she said in confusion, “I have one room.”“The nightmares are spreading,” the boy said angrily, “and now they are moving everyone down to the lower floors to be safe. We are all living on top of each other because of you. Maybe it would be best for you to go and kill yourself. I bet that will stop the nightmares.”The boy finished off her apple in front of her, before throwing the core squarely in her very shocked and rather distraught face. With tears in her eyes, she had tried to ask Beatrice for another apple, yet Beatrice, in growing frustration, snapped at the girl and told her not to be greedy.“Don’t you have enough?” Beatrice sighed exasperatedly, “how much more do you want from us? You already have half of this place to yourself now!”The girl felt tremendously guilty and didn’t ask for more food again, even as the large boy continued to take her apple every day. With only a bit of bread and the occasional few bites of fruit per day, the girl would have likely starved to death at some point in time, or at least become a complete mess from malnutrition, however she managed to pull off an astonishing feat that even she didn’t understand at all. She had been lying in her bed, having long since outgrown the crib, and clutching at her stomach as pain gnawed at her insides. Her body was screaming for sustenance yet she did not dare and go and ask for more food. She simply tried to ignore the pain and go to sleep, yet as she rolled over in bed, she suddenly found herself falling in the air. Panicked, she quickly held her hands out and she landed painfully onto a solid tiled floor, although thankfully the drop hadn’t been from a particular high height.With confusion, she looked around to see that she was no longer in her own bedroom and was… well, she didn’t quite know where. There was something strangely familiar about the place but she didn’t know why it would be. Her attention was stolen before she could think too much about it by the tall glass displays around her that held all manner of bread and cakes in them, and she was overwhelmed by the sudden wafting smell of freshly baked goods in the air. It was heavenly and her mouth began to water at the scent, while her stomach grumbled loudly. So loudly in fact, that a strange man appeared from around the corner, startling her.“What the-!”The large man, who had a big belly and a strange white hat on his head, peered down in confusion at the child who was currently standing within his closed and locked bakery.“How-how did you get in? We’re closed right now,” he said slowly, “you’ll… you’ll have to come back when we open. Where are your parents? Are you lost?”“I don’t have any parents,” the girl replied, “I am from the orphanage.”“Oh, that place…” he muttered grimly, “nasty business that. A shame for the kids there, well… for you, I guess. But how did you get in?”“I guess I was hungry,” she said quietly, “I didn’t mean to come here. Honest.”His expression softened as her stomach grumbled very audibly in front of him.“You don’t get much food over there?” he asked her. She simply shook her head in response.“No and my food gets taken away all the time too.”“That’s rough… Well, look, I can’t just give everything away to every kid who comes sneaking in here,” he began, “but… here, you can at least have this.”He handed her a large loaf of bread and a few small cakes, to her great surprise.“Now, you best be off,” he said as he shuffled her towards the door with her arms full of her new treats, “you know your own way back?”“Oh… I’m sure I can find it,” she replied with a shrug, currently rather distracted by the strange scent of the freshly baked loaf of bread. It was like nothing she had ever experienced; now that she had it up close she could feel it was warm within her hands and it almost smelled… sweet. It was the most comforting thing she had ever held and it almost moved her to tears. She felt a strange urge to hug the loaf but she resisted, knowing that baker would probably think she was crazy.“Well, it’s not too far, you just follow this road straight down and turn left at Rosemary. It’s the first one, you can’t miss it.”The baker unlocked the door and shuffled her out with a slightly sad expression. To run a business within a fast-paced and cut-throat city one had to be firm and strict in their dealings, yet it wasn’t every day that someone had to turn out a young child in the middle of the night. She didn’t seem phased at all however, which was perhaps the most upsetting thing about the whole ordeal. He knew that the city had its share of vagrant children and she wasn’t the first to come begging for scraps (although she was the first to somehow get around his alarm). He simply sighed and tried not to think too much about her as he busied himself back in his work. Life was a cruel mistress in this city and it always had been; London was the city of trampled dreams and calloused fingers. You worked yourself to the bone for a pittance or you perished. The city didn’t discriminate when it came to which dreams it crushed in that regard, and it had always been like that. London may be ‘open’ but many of the doors within it remained firmly ‘closed’.The girl, blissfully unaware of the cultural and economical struggles of the city, took a few steps down the road in the direction of the orphanage, however after a moment she looked around and, when she saw that no-one was watching, she absurdly hugged the loaf tightly in her arms, pulling the loaf up against her cheek. It was unbelievably warm and cosy; she wondered if this is what it felt like to hug another person. After taking a moment to recover herself, she continued to wander down the road and curiously looked around as she went; she hadn’t seen much of the outside world beyond the borders of the orphanage and the park that they visited sometimes (though it had been Sarah who had taken them and she was now, sadly, gone). She was so lost in the world that she almost walked straight past the street that she was meant to be turning down. She quickly spun on the spot to turn back and-She blinked repeatedly as she realised that she was standing in her bedroom once again.‘That’s neat,’ she thought to herself as she sat down on her bed. She felt a bit strange, but she couldn’t really tell whether her dizziness and nausea were from what she had just done or whether it was from the gnawing hunger that she felt in her stomach. Wasting no more time, she simply shrugged and began to pull apart the loaf of bread. She excitedly giggled for the first time in memory as she watched the super soft and spongy bread pull apart in awe. It was light, fluffy and reminded her of the clouds she would often watch float by from her window. She had never thought of the clouds as being bread before, yet now, she couldn’t help but wonder if she could go up and eat them too.‘Maybe I can make myself appear up there too,’ she thought to herself happily, ‘I would have enough food to last forever.’Unlike the clouds, her loaf of bread and single serve cakes (that she enjoyed, but found painfully sweet) hadn’t lasted forever and she had eventually made her way through the loaf over the next few days. She found herself lying in bed once again with the all-too familiar sense of gnawing hunger scratching at her insides. Unfortunately, unlike her blissful ignorance that she previously held, all she could think of now was the soft, pliable bread of that baker who had kindly given it to her. It was an irony of sorts; the act of kindness had only given her a renewed sense of longing and desire, now that she knew just what she was missing out on. She resisted for several more nights, until she eventually caved in and once again, found herself desperately twisting on the spot within her bedroom. Thankfully, it worked and she appeared right in the middle of the bakery to her delight. She was prepared this time however, and she immediately ran to the side and hid behind a silver trolley that perfectly obscured her small frame.“Hm? Someone there?” The baker asked as he rounded a corner to inspect the area, but she stayed quiet and simply waited with bated breath. Eventually, the baker shrugged and returned to the rear, leaving her alone with all of the bread she could ever need. She began to grab the loaves; she took one, two, three, four even-!She stopped with a frown. It didn’t feel right to take so many and she remembered the baker’s kind face when he had given her the first loaf while admitting that he probably shouldn’t. With a soft sigh, she put three of the loaves back on the rack where they belong and after a moment of internal debate, decided that she really didn’t need a full loaf if she was being honest with herself. She pulled the loaf in half and put half back on the shelf with the others, thinking that she was doing the right thing.Satisfied, she spun on the spot and disappeared, returning once again to her bedroom with a happy smile at having mastered the useful little trick, and she began to carefully ration out her bread for the following few days, knowing that she needed to be disciplined with how much she was eating.**The girl blinked and before she knew it, three years had passed since her first trip to that small bakery on the outskirts of London.She had settled into a comfortable rhythm over time; she had learned that the bakery was closed on Sundays and that the baker was only there in the evenings, while a woman ran the shop-front during the day. She had taken to using those precious Sundays to ‘twist’ (as she called it) into the bakery and take a very limited amount of food that, with careful planning, would sustain her through the week. She kept her plunder carefully hidden in her room, but thankfully no-one particularly wanted to step foot into her room and the other children only ever seemed to accost her in the dining area during meal times. The top floor of the orphanage had developed something of a taboo over the years, although now that the floor was empty, none of the other children were experiencing any unusual nightmares.It hadn’t escaped Beatrice’s notice that the girl was somehow managing to survive off a ludicrously small amount of food. Beatrice was no fool; she had seen the other children taking the girl’s food and had seen them throw things at her or call her unspeakable names when they thought no-one was watching. She took it as yet another sign that the girl was simply unnatural in every way; the girl was certainly skinny but she didn’t appear to be starving and Beatrice could only assume that it was because of her demonic traits she clearly possessed. Several years ago Beatrice may have felt pity for her situation, yet now she was starting to feel a rising anger towards the girl and just how poorly the girl had integrated into the orphanage.Beatrice had grown more and more stressed over the years and quite simply, she was getting older. She was tired; she was tired of fighting with children, she was tired of dealing with complicated paperwork and she was tired of dealing with unnatural occurrences happening around her. She was growing tired of the nameless girl who, despite having started to grow up and become quite pretty, was at the same time growing less cute or innocent with every passing day. Beatrice had given up on the idea of the girl being adopted entirely and didn’t even bother doing any viewings any more, since they all ended the same way, no matter what she did. In her bitterness, Beatrice had started to blame the girl for more than just the lack of adoption, even if the girl didn’t do anything else intentionally. Whenever the power went out, she would assume that it was because of the girl or whenever a child had a nightmare at all, it was clearly her influence spreading. Thankfully the girl didn’t do anything specific to antagonise the other children or even defend herself against them in any way. She would quietly hand over her food after eating what she could and head back to her room. Any time that she wasn’t eating, or using the grimy shared bathroom, she spent in her room reading whatever books she could get her hands on. She had started with simple children’s books; picture books that linked words to images or visually explained what a word was. Beatrice didn’t mind her taking those books as she was the youngest and the other children didn’t use them anyway. The children were technically all home-schooled, although their ‘education’ was mostly Beatrice teaching them the basics of English and maths and then letting them figure out the rest on their own. None of the other children had any interest in learning regardless, so Beatrice didn’t waste her precious time on forcing it down their throats. Unlike the others however, their newest addition to the troop was rather interested in learning and she was rapidly advanced beyond the learning material that was made available to her. Beatrice had even caught the girl snooping around the books in the entrance hall; old novels and short stories that were far too advanced for her years. The books were mostly there to make the place look distinguished, not to actually encourage any form of linguistic flexibility among the children. Still, Beatrice didn’t mind if she wanted to flick through adult books that she wouldn’t understand; whatever kept her in her room, kept her quiet and kept her out of their way.The fragile peace (if you could call the bullying, starvation and isolation ‘peaceful’) eventually came crashing down upon a very ordinary Tuesday morning. The older ginger boy who had been a thorn in her side for a long time, Lewis, came along to once again take the ‘demon-child’s’ food (though he had taken to calling her some far more unpleasant names than that lately). She didn’t care at all and simply handed him her fruit without complaint, as per usual.“Nah I don’t want that,” he said with a grin, “I want whatever you got hidden away.”Her heart began to thump loudly at his words; how had he known?“I don’t have anything hidden away,” she said with an outward appearance of calm and quiet, “you take everything I have.”“Bullshit,” the boy said flatly, “old Batty Beatrice even said the other day that she don’t know how you ain’t starved yet. I got to thinking, you must have a stash of some good shit, right? I bet its in your room, isn’t it?”“No!” she replied, a little too quickly.“Knew it,” he smirked and with a brief look over at Beatrice, who was sitting on the other side of the dining area and tiredly reading a newspaper, he began to run off in the directions of the stairs. With fear in her heart, the girl began to race after him, crying out “wait!” as she went.“No running inside, I’ve told you all this!” Beatrice yelled out in anger, but her complaints fell upon deaf ears.Lewis had much longer legs and far wider strides so he was able to reach the bedroom faster that the girl ever could have, however she wasn’t actually as far behind as he would expected her to be. He burst into her room and immediately began to rummage around; tossing her pillow from her bed and lifting up the mattress before throwing open the wardrobe doors and tossing aside the grey, rotten clothing, which was all the girl had ever worn. She thought for a moment that her hiding may have been enough, however her heart sank as he emerged triumphantly with her remaining portion of bread.“So this is what you were hiding… this ain’t the cheap shit they give us,” he said curiously as he took a bite directly from the loaf, “… not bad.”She watched him sit down on her bed and eat his way through her loaf of bread, and she felt strangely violated. It was as though he had not only taken her food, he had taken the only thing that she owned for herself, the only thing that gave her any kind of hope or purpose. It wasn’t really about the bread; he was taking her secret. He was taking her little slice of the world that was just purely for her, and chomping straight through it with every rough bite.“Why?” she asked him with growing anger, “why must you take everything of mine? Why can’t you leave me be?”“Because you’re an evil witch,” he mumbled through his mouthful of bread, “and as I’ve always said, you should leave whatever you’ve got here an’ go kill yourself. Best for everyone, really.”Tears began to form in her eyes as she watched the boy enjoy the last morsels of her bread. Was it really so wrong for her to just want to have something for herself? The boy clearly didn’t appreciate the delicate flavour or the soft texture of the beautiful hand-made bread, he simply chowed it down as if it were nothing and continued to rummage through, finding a few old cakes at the bottom of the wardrobe and almost squealing in delight as he ate them whole. She wasn’t as upset about the cakes, but, they were still her cakes. She had only taken a few over the years as she found them to be too sweet, but, she still likely to occasionally nibble on the edges.“I… I don’t think it’s fair,” she said in a shaky voice, “I don’t think it’s right.”He turned around and laughed in her face, and she winced slightly as crumbs came flying out of his mouth.“What are you going to do about it?” he laughed, “nothing, that’s what.”He pushed her roughly and sent her sprawling out onto the ground. She was shocked; he had thrown things at her before but he had never actually directly hurt her like that before. She slowly rose to her feet, yet before she could even comprehend what had happened to her, he had one again pushed her and sent her back down to the ground.“Pathetic,” he laughed.She tried to get up again, and once more, she found herself back on the ground where she had started.“Stop it!” she cried out with tears in her eyes, “you’re being so mean!”“Like I said, what are you going to do about it?” he laughed. She paused; she didn’t know what to do about it. What could she do about it? He was so much larger than her and she couldn’t even get to her feet. The knowledge made her angry; it simply wasn’t fair. He wasn’t fair. None of this was fair!She glared at him from the ground, however he simply snickered at her expression. That was, until his laughter slowly began to fade and was suddenly replaced by sounds of horror as his hands sprung to his throat and he started to gasp loudly for air. She was quite shocked, and rather intrigued, as she stood up slowly and watched him spluttering before her. He was starting to turn a different colour in his face and it was rather fascinating.“Right, what the hell is going on here-” Beatrice began as she finally reached the room on the top floor with an exhausted huff. The stairs seemed to get steeper and steeper every day for Beatrice.Her eyes landed on the choking boy and she gasped with her hand over her mouth.“What are you doing?” she hissed vehemently to the young girl, “let him go this instant!”“I’m not doing anything!” the girl cried out indignantly, “I don’t know what’s wrong with him!”Lewis’ eyes began to roll back into his head and at this point Beatrice, in a panic, turned and smacked the small girl hard across the face. The force of the hit left her seeing stars and she fell down once again, too shell-shocked by the blow to even comprehend what was happening. It seemed to be effective however as Lewis immediately drew in several loud, rasping breaths in an attempt to fill his lungs with as much oxygen as he could drag into his screaming body.“She’s-she’s-crazy-” he panted out between breaths, “tried-to-kill-me-”“I didn’t!” she replied as she got to her feet, “I didn’t!”“You,” Beatrice said in a low, dangerous voice, “you’re coming with me. I’ve had enough of this.”Beatrice grabbed her by the hair and painfully dragged her across the room, to the satisfaction of Lewis as he watched on, still panting heavily. She was dragged all the way to the stairs and roughly escorted, in front of the growing crowd of children who had come to watch, down into the cellar that was below the orphanage. It was originally a storage space for valuable commodities, although the orphanage hadn’t possessed anything valuable enough to store down there in some time. The ‘security systems’ were still in place however, which turned out to be a set of iron bars and an open gate. There was a small flight of stairs prior to the gate, which Beatrice roughly tossed the girl down, sending her rolling painfully into the barred off area. Once she was in, Beatrice slammed the gate shut and, for good measure, sealed the padlock while the children behind her cheered and jeered at the sight.“Enjoy your new room,” Beatrice said bitterly, “maybe now we’ll both have some peace around here.”She turned and took the stairs back up before closing the outer cellar door, leaving the confused girl in complete darkness.**It was dark, cold and rather filthy in the cellar that she now called her room. Her eyes adjusted to the lack of light over time and she discovered that there were a few things within the cellar that she could use. A few old straw sacks became a makeshift bed and there was a sink to the side that had running water she could use to drink or clean herself with (though she didn’t know if drinking it was the best idea since it tasted a little… metallic). There were large drains in the corner and she could remove the cover do her business, as unpleasant as that was. She got used to it over time however, since she had little other choice. She was grateful for the large sink, since the source of running water had become the lynchpin of her entire life both for drinking and for cleanliness. She even had company now; though it came in the form of a few mice that curiously watched her disturb their habitat with suspicious eyes.She had never truly appreciate the finer things about her old bedroom before, but she certainly had begun to miss it now. It had a bed in it, for one thing, even if it was hard and very damaged. Here, she simply slept on the painful stone floor and her assortment of worn, old, straw bedding did little to relieve the pressure. She had none of her books in here, although she didn’t have the light to read them anyway and if she really wanted to, she could practically remember those books word-for-word by this point. She did find a light switch and even a power socket during her exploration, however unsurprisingly the light didn’t work and she doubted that the power socket did either, not that she even had anything to put in there anyway. At least she was no longer having her food taken from her and since it was quite cold in the cellar it even seemed to be keeping for longer than it used to. She would cover her eyes every morning when Beatrice would arrive at the top of the stairs and throw some scraps of food down to the bottom in anger. She didn’t care about that at first since she had her access to the bakery of course and for the first night she simply threw the scraps of food down one of the industrial sized drains in the corner.She visited the bakery once again while it was closed to take her usual serving from the shelves, however she was met with an unexpected sight and sound when she arrived this time. The baker was not there, however there was the slightly uncomfortable sound of sharp nails scratching on glass and she looked over to see that there was a large black dog sniffing around the door and attempting to push it open.She was confused at the sight, however she couldn’t help but notice that the dog was rather frail and she could see the dogs ribs sticking out against her skin. It reminded her of herself; whenever she would strip and clean herself she would run her hands over her gaunt sides and bony hips, wondering if that was what everyone felt like underneath their clothes. She hadn’t noticed or cared in the slightest before, however as she continued to grow she had become more and more aware of the presence of her body and the many features that it had (or lacked). It hadn’t escaped her notice that Beatrice was quite large around the stomach and had very large breasts that visibly hung on her chest, while she did not. She wondered about that; would she develop them when she was older? Would her stomach get larger and her legs get thicker? As she looked at the thin dog attempting to work out how to get in the door, she sighed and took pity on the poor creature. She took some of the bread and moved over to the door, seeing the dog pause for a moment as it realised that someone was actually inside.“It’s okay,” she said kindly as approached the door and began to fiddle with the lock, “I’m not going to hurt you.”It took some maneuvering but eventually, she figured out how the little lock worked on the door and she was able to open it up. The dog backed up cautiously when she swung the door open, but she simply tossed the bread out to him and after a moment, he began to wolf it down eagerly.“You’re very cute,” she said to the shaggy dog.“Woof.”“Do you not have parents either?”“Woof.”“I live at the orphanage. It’s a place for children without parents.”“... woof.”“I don’t get much food there so I have to come here and steal it. I feel bad about it but…”“Woof…”“It’s okay though, because do you know what? I can teleport! That’s how I get in here!”“Woof?”“Our little secret though!”“Woof! Woof!”She laughed at the dog as it happily panted and stared back at her. He tilted his head and looked at her curiously, which only caused her to chuckle even more. Perhaps it was her laugh that startled him; it had startled herself since she had almost forgotten how to laugh. In fact, she wasn’t sure that she remembered laughing at all. She probably sounded ridiculous.“I think-”She began to speak once again, however she was cut off as a car arrived out the front of the bakery. She knew what cars were (in theory) but this one was quite strange; it had bright red and blue flashing lights on the top of it and two people in matching uniforms quickly got out of the car as soon as they pulled over.“Stop right there! Police!”The dog growled in their direction and raised its hackles at them, which told the girl everything she needed to know. She didn’t wait around to see what they wanted; instead she turned and ran to the back of the bakery once again before turning on the spot and disappearing. She arrived safely back in the cellar in a panic, however as she slowly began to calm down she realised that she wouldn’t be able return any time soon. More than anything else, she grew concerned about the dog; what if he needed help? She should have brought the dog with her or… something… She hoped that he was okay; surely those people would have just shooed him away. Unless… what if he ended up like her, trapped in a cage somewhere? What if they killed him? It was a depressing thought and she regretted having it as soon as it entered her head, but somehow, she thought that was probably the most likely outcome and it festered like an infected wound, sending her into a downward spiral of negative thoughts and emotions. With the knowledge that she couldn’t go to the bakery again, she instead focused on carefully rationing her own portion of scrap food throughout the day, and she simply did nothing more than pass the time, alone in the dark.A few weeks after the alarm had been tripped, the baker wondered why his ‘mystery thief’, who had been humorously taking half a bread loaf every week for the past few years, hasn’t shown up again. He had enjoyed coming in to find that half-torn loaf every Monday, because he knew it meant that the girl he had once caught within his shop was still doing okay. It was always the same; half a loaf of bread and occasionally, just occasionally, a caramel tart or apple pie. Now however, with his stock perfectly intact for several weeks, he wondered whether something had happened to her and his heart sank at the thought. He could only hope that she was no long coming because she no longer needed to steal, but somehow, even he doubted that.He sadly broke a fresh loaf in two and left one half sitting out just in case, but she never did come back to take it.**“Oh, who is it?” the girl wondered loudly, as if there was any doubt as to who would be entering her cellar in the morning, as per every morning.“It’s me,” Beatrice said tiredly, as if she hadn’t answered the question a thousand times before, “here’s your breakfast.”Beatrice no longer threw scraps on the ground as she used to, she instead handed a paper plate to the girl through the gate. A small mercy, but one that the girl rather appreciated.“Thank you,” she replied politely, “I read once that you should always be polite. It’s a nice feeling, isn’t it?”“Sure,” Beatrice said dismissively, knowing that the girl would chatter away about nonsense for hours given the chance, “anyway, I have a surprise for you.”“A surprise?” she asked suspiciously. She does not like surprises; by its very nature, a surprise is unexpected and unexpected is usually unpleasant.“Here she is,” Beatrice said as she stepped away from the gate.The girl peered out at familiar face, who moved around Beatrice and peered back in.“... Sarah?”“Oh my god,” Sarah exclaimed as she looked at the girl, “look at you, you’ve gotten so tall, and so pretty!”“Oh. Thank you,” the girl replied, “you look like you are doing well.”Sarah did look rather fabulous as she was dressed in rather fashionable business attire; a bright blue skirt and blazer with a white collared shirt and shiny black heels that clicked and clacked when she walked. Her hair was tied up in a neat bun and her cheeks had a rosy blush upon them.“I didn’t think that you would still be here,” Sarah admitted, “I was in the neighbourhood and I thought, for old times sake, I would come by. What… are you doing down here?”“This is my room,” the girl replied lightly.“It’s uh…” Sarah began as she tried to peer around in the dark, “don’t you need some light down here?”“The lights don’t work,” the girl replied, “broken. But I don’t mind it. I’m like an owl. Hoot. Hoot.”“Right…” Sarah said slowly.“Well, you’ve said your hellos,” Beatrice said briskly, “time you said your goodbyes.”“Wait-that’s it?” the girl asked quickly, “but… but-”“I’ll come see you again,” Sarah replied sadly with a knowing look towards Beatrice, “I’m only here for a one-day conference but I’ll visit again before I go, if that’s what you would like.”“I would love it.”Sarah smiled fondly before she turned around and was ushered out by Beatrice, who closed the cellar door and left the girl alone in the dark once more.“That is inhumane,” Sarah said immediately after they closed the door, “I can’t believe you keep her down there.”“Well we both know she isn’t human,” Beatrice said with a frown.“Don’t pull that shit on me, Beatrice,” Sarah said sharply, “she was certainly… odd, but it doesn’t give you the right to be cruel.”“You wouldn’t understand,” Beatrice said with a shake of her head, “after you left things only got worse. Floating toys were the least of our problems! She almost killed Lewis! Almost killed him!”“So you cage her like a dog?” Sarah asked incredulously, “instead of getting her the help she needs?”“What would you have me do, Sarah?” Beatrice asked exasperatedly, “I’ve tried everything, even tried having her exorcised and she just looked confused.”“She clearly needs her own space and proper care,” Sarah said pointedly.“You… of all people, you show up after years and suddenly decide to play the defender of the downtrodden? Tell me; what have you done for these children since you left, hm? Campaigned for greater funding? Advocated for more adoptive parents? Hm?”Sarah said nothing in response and simply stared at Beatrice with sad eyes.“You left like everyone else and as always, I was the one who stayed and looked after them. You don’t get to be high and mighty with me, I’ve done more for her than you ever did.”Sarah pursed her lips, but she said no more as she left.She had to admit that there was truth in Beatrice’s words; she had abandoned the children many years ago and she didn’t really have a right to suddenly stick her nose in and criticise what was going on. Beatrice was right in her assumptions; Sarah had been so caught up in her work that she hadn’t done anything good lately. She hadn’t volunteered, she hadn’t advocated for anything, she had simply gone to work, put in her overtime, went home and slept. Until she returned to London for this conference, she had hardly thought about the children at all.As a small way to make amends, she did the only thing that she could think of doing.“What’s this?” the girl asked curiously as Sarah handed her a strange object the following afternoon.“It’s a lamp,” Sarah pointed out, “I know it doesn’t look like the ones you are used to but it works just the same. It’s battery powered and has very long lasting batteries in it. If you need more later, I’m sure Beatrice can work something out.”Beatrice simply grunted, not offering anything in way of a committed response.“Oh, that’s really cool!” The girl sounded happy, albeit still slightly confused. Sarah had to admit that the lamp was a bit out of the ordinary as it was shaped like a cube and had to be pressed in to be turned on or off, like a button, but Sarah though it was cute and fun and it seemed that the girl agreed.“And here,” Sarah pulled a stack of books from her large bag and handed them to the girl, “now I know that these are going to be too advanced for you right now, but I think if you keep practicing and working at it, then one day-”“Books!” the girl exclaimed happily, “oh, I do love to read.”Sarah smiled fondly at her and placed her hand gently on the girl’s shoulder.“You take care of yourself,” Sarah whispered quietly, “I’m sorry I can’t do more but if Beatrice gives you any trouble… don’t be afraid to use those powers of yours, you hear me?”“I… I hear you,” the girl replied quietly.After a moment of hesitation, Sarah leaned down and pulled the girl into a hug. It was the first time that she had been properly hugged before and it was an overwhelming sensation, to say the least. Sarah was much taller than she was, yet she still crouched down to match her height and she was very soft and warm. She smelled sweet, and kind, and it was a very pleasant experience, even if the girl was simply standing there, clutching her books to her chest while being hugged.Sarah gave one final sad smile and departed, followed out by Beatrice who gave the girl an unreadable look before turning and closing the door.Excited, the girl hurried back over to her makeshift bed and placed the cube down, slowly pressing it down until it clicked and lit up with a gentle glow. She giggled happily, and immediately began to work her way through the books that she had been given. Sarah wasn’t kidding; the books were quite difficult for her and unlike anything she had read so far, but she endured. After all, it wasn’t like she was doing anything else with her time.‘In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and…’She spent the next year reading and re-reading the books that she had been given, over and over, until she could almost recite them from cover to cover. What she lacked in vocabulary she made up for with imagination, and she only needed to understand a few key words from the stories in order to add the rest in for herself. It was like a brand new adventure every time she read the same stories as her shifting imagination grew and adapted, adding in vibrant colours to the scenes or dramatically re-imagining the landscape. Each time she read through a story, she found a new word, or read the same sentence a different way, which completely changed her understanding of the story.It was perhaps the most pleasant year of her life so far; which said everything that needed to be said about the state of her life.**The girl was mildly content as time went on. Perhaps not exactly ‘happy’, nor loved or welcomed, but she was alive and had something to occupy her time with. It was enough for her incredibly low standards of living that she possessed and she figured that she could simply continue living like this if she must. She had even learned a neat little trick when the batteries in her lamp had finally died; she knew there was no way that Beatrice would ever get her new batteries but, now that she had the books to read, she was inspired to try and ensure she had a source of light. She had first done it accidentally and shocked herself when she had woken up to find a tiny ball of light floating in the air. It had disappeared as soon as she realised that she was the cause, however she spent the next few months attempting to recreate it. She had reached the point where she could summon enough light to read by, though she did wonder just how big she could actually get her little floating orb of light.Overall, things were going okay for the girl as she quietly read her books in the cellar by the light of her magic. That was, until Beatrice came down to the cellar one night with a strange look to her face and with a disgusting smell in the air.“I should have known,” she slurred slightly as she pulled open the gate, “black magic. No doubt.”“What do you mean?” the girl replied carefully, “are you okay, Madam Beatrice?”“Oh go on, call me by what you all say,” Beatrice said with a very loud laugh, “I know what you all call me. I know what you all say about me.”“I… I don’t say anything about you,” the girl said. Had Beatrice forgotten that she didn’t talk to the other children and hadn’t for a very long time? Who would she say anything to?“Bullshit,” Beatrice spat, “it’s all your fault in the end, as it always is.”“What did I do?”“They’re stopping the grants,” Beatrice said with a dry laugh, “they’re ‘phasing out’ the orphanages and going to their ‘care home’ models. Bah! Good for the posters and the slogans and the voters, but not for the kids. You’ll see. You’ll all see. It will be the kids who suffer for it in the end while greasy politicians line their pockets and their privately owned construction companies build these ‘care homes’ while skimming off the top. It’s a lie, all of it!”The girl was on edge as she realised that something was not right with Beatrice. She was stumbling slightly, she was slurring her words and she was speaking much louder than she normally did.“Madam Beatrice,” she asked once again, “are… are you sure you’re okay?”“Twenty years!” Beatrice suddenly shouted out of nowhere, “twenty years dry. Not a sip. Not until now.”“I don’t understand,” the girl said carefully.“I don’t understand,” Beatrice mocked in a sing-song voice, “of course you don’t. All you do is hurt people, don’t you? That’s all you understand. How to murder people and terrorise people and-”“I… don’t do those things…”“You know I used to think you were a demon; the devil in disguise.”Beatrice stumbled slightly, but she continued.“Now I think you’re just a stupid little girl who gives people nightmares and doesn’t appreciate what I’ve done for you.”“I thought everyone would be happy,” the girl said quietly, “I’m down here and out of the way, isn’t that the best thing for everyone?”“You are a god-forsaken curse,” Beatrice said aggressively, though she laughed humourless and added, “just like me. Why have you forsaken me?”The girl had no idea what Beatrice was talking about but she was growing concerned about her behaviour.“Have I not suffered for my one moment of mercy?” Beatrice suddenly moaned out in despair, “she was but a babe, do you despise me for not being cold and cruel like yourself?”The girl said nothing as she was completely and utterly baffled about what Beatrice was talking about.“Is that what you want?” Beatrice slurred with a hiccup, “because if that’s what you truly want, it is what I will do…”Beatrice suddenly began to approach the alarmed girl, who rapidly retreated for the corner.“Wait, what are you doing? No, stop!”Beatriced reached forward and grabbed a handful of the girl’s hair.“Ow! Let go!”“We will both repent together,” Beatrice said with determination and the girl gagged on the overwhelming small of potent fumes coming from her breath, “yes, it is only fitting…”“No!” “I said NO!”A strange shockwave burst forth from the small girl and Beatrice was sent flying across the room in pure shock. Beatrice was getting old and her body was not what it once was, so she cried out in pain when she landed harshly on the cold, stone floor. There was a strong possibility that something had broken, however through her anger and intoxication she somehow managed to get to her feet once again.“You ungrateful little bitch!” Beatrice roared, “how dare you!”Beatrice moved towards the girl once again, however as she backed away in fear a strange, ethereal barrier appeared between the two. Beatrice paused in horror.“What is this black magic?” Beatrice cried out, “the work of the devil himself!”She tried to kick the barrier and push her way through, yet it stood as strong as steel; unrelenting, unyielding.With no way to pass the barrier, Beatrice inflated with rage and did the only other thing that she could think of doing; she took out her anger onto the girl’s possessions.“No!”Beatrice grinned vindictively as she stomped violently on Sarah’s lamp, crushing it under her feet and plunging the room into darkness.“Take that!” Beatrice exclaimed victoriously, “and that! That’s what you get you stupid whore! Question me in my own house!?”The girl was shocked at the sight and tried to run forward, however the barrier was also blocking her own entry through it. It was completely impenetrable, despite the girl’s best efforts to force her way through and all she could was watch on in horror. Beatrice soon realised that the girl was trapped by her own barrier and grinned as another idea came to her.“You love your books, don’t you?” she said as she picked up one of them, “well lets make sure you have some light to read, then!”Beatrice pulled a lighter from her pocket and ignited the flame, slowly lowering the corner of the book down with taunting glee.“Stop it…” the girl cried out, “stop it! I haven’t done anything wrong! Anything! Why are you doing this?”Beatrice ignited the book before her eyes and laughed as she dropped it down onto the stack. The girl would have rather been beaten than watch this; yet she couldn’t move forward at all or take down the accursed barrier and had no choice but to stare at the sorrowful sight.Satisfied at seeing the girl’s horror and pain, Beatrice scoffed and finally departed, holding her sides as the pain of her fall started to make itself known to her.The small fire that had started with the books did not extinguish itself and the girl realised with a growing sense of fear that there were other flammable things down in the cellar. Just about everything was made of wood and all it would take was for the fire to spread to the timber frames, and after that…“Go away you stupid thing!” she shouted angrily as she pounded her tiny fist against the shimmering wall of light that blocked her path, “go away!”The fire was growing and the air was starting to become filled with a thick smoke. It was, admittedly, slightly hypnotic to watch the smoke rise and form the gentle bands in the air, however she knew that she couldn’t just sit there and watch it happen.“Go away! Go away!” she shouted repeatedly, “GO AWAY!”She hit the barrier with her open palm and the barrier suddenly burst forward. An intense gust of wind exploded outwards and the girl was sent flying back from the recoil. She looked up from the ground to see that the fire had been extinguished due to the sudden flood of air, and with relief she slumped back down again, exhausted. Eventually, she had no choice but to get up and start cleaning up the mess in her room, and that was practically all the girl did for the next two years; sit in the dark and occasionally clean it with nothing but elbow grease. Her books were gone, her lamp was destroyed and now she had nothing.She spent a lot of time alone with her thoughts after that, while playing idly with her magic from time to time. Sometimes, she thought she could hear a strange voice telling her that she was nothing but a ghost that was still walking among the living.“How fitting,” she would mumble to herself quietly, “a ghost. Nothing but a ghost.”

The girl was sitting alone within the dark confines of her ‘room’, idly bouncing a basketball sized orb of light back and forth against the wall with two hands. She had been forced to come up with new and creative ways to keep her mind from slipping away and as a result, she had been regularly pushing the boundaries of what she could achieve with with her strange powers. What had begun as a simple source of light had turned into her main source of amusement; each time that she threw the light back to the wall she would try to make it bigger and brighter before it returned to her hands, until it would inevitably grow too large and she would struggle to keep its form, causing the light to flicker and fade into the darkness where she would begin with her tennis ball sized light once again. With precious little else to do, it gave her some kind of dexterous mental and physical task to do and she often switched things up by bouncing it off different surfaces, or attempting to throw and catch it with her eyes closed. It was a far more difficult task than it sounded, given that the ball made absolutely no noise when it struck a surface, although sometimes she did wish that she had a real ball purely for that satisfying ‘thud’ that she was missing.At first, she had been quite upset about her predicament and had mourned the loss of her books and the loss of the only precious item that she had ever owned. Yet as time thoughtlessly powered forward, she found that her formerly powerful emotions had begun to fade into a cathartic apathy and a sense of dispassionate disregard. When she had first been unceremoniously dumped into the cellar, she had felt a certain anger and discontentment within her soul yet as everything around her was stripped away by the darkness that nibbles at the edges of her vision, she felt herself slowly slipping away without a care in the world. Her deep thoughts and vivid imagination were not aided by the intense isolation and over time, they began to transform into vague musings and existential questions that poked and prodded at the delicate veil that guarded the soul.Why am I here? Is this all that there is for me? What purpose does this serve?She began to see herself as nought but a shattered reflection to be observed from afar; a pane of fractured glass that warped time and twisted life around its sharp, broken edges until something unrecognisable eventually emerged from the cracks of light with a polite smile, asking kindly if it was allowed to pass through to the other side, and each time a chorus of darkness and silence would slam the dangerous shard back in place and cry, ‘no.’The days melded into weeks and the months stumbled into years, although the girl hardly noticed the passing of time at all. She occupied her body with pointless tasks that served no real purpose, although she struggled far more with generating any kind of stimulation for the mind. Her mind wandered into strange and surreal places; she hadn’t seen a mirror in quite some time and she wondered what she would see if she was to look into one. Would she even know the girl on the other side? Perhaps she would be kind and thoughtful, with an infectious laugh that spread joy and happiness to any she drifted down upon, or perhaps she would be cold and dangerous, a ticking time-bomb that threatened to violently detonate and ruin everything that the world held dear. Perhaps, she would see neither and instead, she would simply see the vacant, silver eyes of a ghost who was still walking among the living.Her sense of time had become so completely distorted that she didn’t even know what age she was anymore, nor how long she had been in the cellar. Time is a highly underrated construct; to be without a sense of time is to drift dangerously beyond the thin fabrics of the world that give one a sense of purpose and meaning. The tiniest strands of security that keep the most volatile of people calm and connected to their environment; the ticking of a second or the leaping of a year, all carefully constructed to ensure that every person had their place and knew their value. An age is provided on good faith as a careful collection of currency and traded for peace and serenity.‘May I purchase a year of life, good sir?’‘Certainly, that will cost three hundred and sixty five days.’‘Do you mind if I pay in minutes?’‘I only accept hours, I’m afraid.’The girl had no idea at all but it was, in fact, her eleventh birthday that she was quietly spending bouncing a magical orb off a dirty wall within a locked cellar. A rather poor trade, however the month was rather weak at the moment and was trading poorly against the day. Such was the case of Great Depressions; perhaps when a boom hit, she would be able to short the year in exchange for a few valuable hours. If only.The only concept of time that she still possessed was whenever Beatrice opened the door to throw some scraps of food down into her abyss. The heavens opened above her as light flooded inward, and just as quickly, retreated back once it had seen the darkness and despair below. At first, she believe that it signaled the morning and the start of the day, yet the hours blended together into such a painful whirlwind of time that she was no longer even sure that was the truth. Who was to say that there was any form of regularity to her arrival of food? All it would take is a different hour, or a different day, and every system of measurement that she had provided for herself would come crumbling apart at the seams. Whenever the heavens opened she had begun to ask all sorts of questions about time, yet the heavens rarely replied. Their place was within the light after all, not down in the dark depths with her.Instead of following a pattern, she began to simply sleep whenever she wanted; her sleep cycle constantly rotated through the day and night. She would sleep to numb the pain, she would sleep from fatigue, she would sometimes simply sleep because she couldn’t come up with anything else to do. The lack of any kind of sleep pattern was, unsurprisingly, not particularly helpful to her mental state and it only served to cause her to withdraw even further into her own shell as her mind struggled to find any kind of grounding in the world.For the first few months of her renewed life sentence within this dark space, she had toyed with the idea of using her teleport to go outside, even if for no other reason but to simply see the sun, yet every time that she considered it, a strange and unusual fear crept over her. It had been so long and she longed for the warmth of its embrace, yet at the same time, she understood this dark and cold world that she was in. She understood that time had no meaning here; she found a strange comfort in drifting peacefully through the days as they speed up, and slowed down, at will. Down here, she knew that she was her only friend, her best friend and her worst enemy, all wrapped up into one fractured girl who peered back at herself through the shattered reflections of her past and her future. The thought of going outside became beautiful; a place of endless potential and limitless possibilities. It represented the ideal of hope and conquest, of power and glory, of achievement and finality. She could see the sun in all of its splendor within her mind, and she felt that the day she saw the sun would be the day that she finally, blissfully passed from this world. It was a reward that was waiting for her on the other side, and she knew that she couldn’t just go look at it now. Not yet, not until it was time. The sun was potential and therefore it was beautiful; not because of what it was but because of what it could be.She paused in her thoughts as she realised that something was distracting her from her usual musings. Something was off. She continued to bounce the ball of light as she wondered just what it was causing her to stir. Perhaps she was truly, finally, blissfully, losing her mind as she desperately wished that she would but, no, there was definitely something unusual happening.She looked down as she bounced the light and realised that something was sitting on the ground right in front of her bare and calloused feet. Her eyes were being caught by a shimmering reflection with each rhythmic passing of the gentle blue light. The light was being reflected off the surface of a deep, black ink that almost looked as if it had been freshly written up the front of an envelope that had, somehow, found its way down to her at some point in time. She peered down at it with a mild interest growing in her mind; for the first time in a long time, her curiosity had began to shyly peek out from behind a closed door and stare at the strange sight.It was a letter; a very fancy looking letter at that, which was strange enough on its own. Why would a letter be down here? It wasn’t here yesterday, nor the day before, as far as she was aware. Who was it intended for? It certainly couldn’t have been for her. She didn’t exist after all, and only a few misguided fools wrote letters to the ghosts who walked among the living.She released her orb of light and instead reached out to pick up the letter, however she was forced to pull her hand back immediately. It was as though she had been electrocuted by the strange letter; as soon as her fingers had touched the paper she felt a rush of power and energy like she had never felt before. It was intoxicating and she could feel her entire body drowning slowly within the addictive feeling of crackling energy that now permeated the air around her. She had been lethargic and apathetic for so long that the sudden burst of life from within the letter had shaken her very mind awake. As the dust began to be brushed out from the corners of her brain, she peered down once again with renewed, and very alert, eyes.She knew; this letter held a strange power that was not unlike her own. Her right palm was painfully throbbing and she held it to her face with a feeling of awe and excitement. This letter had come to her specifically, it was surely no coincidence that this letter possessed the same kind of energy that she had. No-one had placed the letter here, nor dropped it in their mailbox, nor asked Beatrice to pass it on. This letter was for her, and for her only, and it had ensured through the application of physics-defying force that it reached her. She knew it.After taking a moment to steady her trembling hands, she reached down once again and slowly picked up the letter, this time avoiding any sparking of strange powers or illogical chemical reactions. She wondered for a moment if perhaps the strange sensation she had felt had merely been from her own body suddenly waking from its emotional and chemical slumber, stirring as it made contact with something that it finally recognised as a familiarity. The floating ball of light surprisingly zoomed to her head without instruction, as if it knew that this was an important moment for the girl. Perhaps the light itself was simply eager for its own purpose and place in the world. It had been there for her in her darkest moments, and she felt it only fitting that it light the way for her once again as she inspected the letter, starting with the first two words on the front.“Is that...?”She gasped with shock as she inspected the extravagant, flourished letters that swirled in beautiful loops across the front of the perfectly sealed envelope that she held within her small, delicate and suddenly trembling hands.“... is that my name?”She stared down at the two words and for once, her mind was too stunned to race wildly around her head. Why was her heart pounding so rapidly? Why did she feel so much… fear? She realsed that she was utterly terrified at the thought of those two words being her name. Yet, she already knew that it was; as soon as she read them she knew that it was her. Her fear wasn’t of the name itself, but of what it represented; she feared what it might mean to accept those two words as her own and to take on the burden of responsibility that she now suddenly felt. She found herself facing a new question that rattled through her struggling mind;Do I really want to open this letter?She had no answer to that question, however she could hear a strange, distant voice telling her to be brave, to be strong. She laughed a single, tiny laugh at the thought that she had finally gone mad, that she had finally succumbed to the dark. Once the first laugh broke free she found that she could no longer stop; she began to laugh loudly and wildly, with tears forming in her eyes and she struggled to breath, despite knowing that there was nothing funny about it.When she would look back upon this moment many years later, she could never quite recall why she had eventually decided to open the letter. She knew only that she was glad she did.The letter was an offering of acceptance to a school that apparently taught ‘witchcraft’ and ‘wizardry’, of all things. The mere notion would have been ludicrous to anyone else and would have been immediately dismissed as a poorly disguised scam or rather elaborate prank, but not her. Her heart pounded as she realised that this was what she needed. This was it; this was the answer to understanding her life and why she was here. This was her ticket to the sunlight.“... term begins on the 1st of September…… three sets of plain work robes (black)…… the Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk…… students may also bring, if they desire, an owl OR a cat OR a toad…

Yours sincerely,Minerva McGonagall,Deputy Headmistress.”It was as though the letter had been written in a foreign language as she didn’t even understand half of what was said within it, however she clutched it to her chest regardless with tears in her eyes. There were other people out there like her! She couldn’t possibly be the devil, if there was a whole community of people out there! There was even enough to form an entire school!Her burst of excitement faded as soon as it arrived, however. She had no idea where to go, or what to do. Where was this school? There was certainly no way that Beatrice was going to allow her to go or to help in any way, and she had no money, nor transport. She had nothing.She slowly realised that the idea of going to the school was a nice fantasy, but that’s all it was. A fantasy.Still, she at least she had the comforting letter itself and that was more than enough for her. The knowledge that she wasn’t the only one and that there were others out there like her was a bright flame of comfort within her chest. She slipped the letter back into its envolope and tenderly ran her fingers over the black letters on the front, which in perfect cursive letters formed the words;Skyla Potter,The Cage in the Cellar,Wool’s Orphanage,London.

Skyla (as she was still getting used to calling herself) sat within her room and continued to bounce her little ball of blue light off the wall as she sat and thought deeply. She hadn’t heard the name before, since any of the the other girls she had know were called “Sarah,” or “Hannah,” or such. She rather liked the way it rolled off her tongue and even let out a small giggle as she thought about how it was quite fun to say. She enjoyed exaggerating the second syllable and extending it out as she repeated her name to herself multiple times with an amused voice. She thought that it also looked quite nice in the fanciful, cursive characters that were on the front of her acceptance letter, though she wouldn’t have a clue about how to actually write in such a way. She wondered if the others would make fun of her if they found out what her name was, but surprisingly, she found that she didn’t really care anymore. It was a strange feeling to her, but she felt as though she had suddenly gained something back that belonged to her, something of tremendous importance. It wasn’t just a name that she had reclaimed; she had gained the beginnings of a sense of self, something that was far more important than the name on its own.The positive thoughts that she was having left her running on a high for several days, however she slowly began to settle down as her thoughts once again turned to her state of being within the dark cellar. She may have a name now, and that was a tremendous comfort to her, yet it wasn’t as though she could share that fact with anyone, and it wasn’t as though that actually changed anything about her life.Just as she began to fall back into her emotional slumber, a loud noise from outside the cellar caused the ball of light to drop from her hands and disappear as she sprung to her feet, like a startled deer. She could hear an unfamiliar man shouting very loudly from outside, and she could hear the sound of something being thrown and smashed outside the door. The disturbing noises got closer and closer until-“THE NERVE!” an absolute giant of a man roared as he physically kicked the outer door of the cellar in, flooding her room with painfully blinding light and shards of broken wood, “THE DAUGHTER OF LILY AND JAMES POTTER KEPT IN A CELLAR!?”Skyla stared in absolute shock as the largest man she had ever seen in her life tried to squeeze down into the small, enclosed space. The cramped conditions (for him, at least) seemed to only make him angrier as he aggressively demanded the key to the gate from a red-faced Beatrice who hovered in the back.“Forget it!” he said angrily after waiting for only a split-second, “stand back!”He reached forward and placed two hands on either side of the gate, grabbing hold of the iron bars and he pulled with a mighty heave. Skyla quickly scrambled for the back of the cellar as the stone crumbled and with absurd strength, he managed to pull the entire combination of gate and bars from their foundations. Thankfully they weren’t load bearing as they had been added after the construction of the cellar, however as the dust settled Skyla did wonder for a moment if she was moments away from having the entire orphanage collapse upon her. It was quite terrifying, as was the man who was responsible.“Right then,” the man huffed with exertion as he shuffled into the cellar in a very uncomfortable looking crouch, “where you at?”Skyla said nothing at all as she hugged the back wall in fear. She hoped that the large man wouldn’t be able to see her as she clung to whatever shadows she could still find, however he pulled out, of all things, a small pink umbrella and the cellar was suddenly flooded with more light.“Oh…”He stared at her with a shocked expression plastered on his face.The girl looked terrible; she was covered in muck and grime, despite her best efforts to keep herself clean with merely tap water and she wore what could only be described as tattered rags, since the holes in her clothing were now so large that it made it hard to see where the clothing was actually supposed to end. Her long, black hair was matted and filthy, and her face was just as dirty as the rest of her body was. What truly shocked the man however was the thinness of her face and the gaunt way in which her eyes sat within her sockets. Her legs were exceedingly thin and she wasn’t much more than skin and bone in any part of her body. She hadn’t needed to use many of her muscles for a long time and so they had atrophied in a way that made him slightly ill to look at.Incidentally, as her eyes slowly adjusted to the new source of bright white light, Skyla thought that the man in front of her looked very bizarre and out of place as he was so tall, wide and plump. His dark brown hair was almost as long as hers was and it was just as wild, if not more-so as it was frizzy and stuck out from his head like a lion’s mane. She wondered if he was like the stories Beatrice had once told her of Samson; she had a sudden strange urge to cut the hair and see if he lost his strength. In addition to his bushy hair, he had a large, untamed beard that obscured the entire lower half of his face. She couldn’t help but remember the exaggerated illustrations she had once seen in a children’s book of dangerous and wild looking vikings who raided coastal villages and drank endless amounts of alcohol with rough mannerisms and energetic dispositions.The man certainly looked as though he was capable of raiding a village by himself, although she couldn’t help but think a small pink umbrella wouldn’t be a vikings first choice of weapon.“What have they done to you?” he asked in low voice.Skyla said nothing and simply tried to process exactly what she was looking at and how her world had suddenly flipped upside down.“You never replied to your letter, so Dumbledore, he… but then the address…” the man began, but he faltered when he realised that Skyla wasn’t listening to a word of what he was saying and she was staring up at him with wide and fearful eyes.“I’m not here to hurt you or nothin’,” he said quickly with realisation, “look, here,” he maneuvered himself around for a moment until he awkwardly sat down on the floor in the middle of the cellar. It did help Skyla to relax; with how much difficulty he had getting himself down she was quite confident that it would take him a solid minute or two to get up again.“Are you quite finished making yourself at home!?” Beatrice demanded loudly of the man in shock and anger, “who do you think you are!? Look what you have done to my door, you are barking mad if you think that I’m paying for tha-”With a terrifying scowl, the large man turned around and pointed his pink umbrella at Beatrice. To Skyla’s (and Beatrice’s) immense shock, a giant wave of flames shot forth from the umbrella and Beatrice screamed loudly in fear. The flames engulfed her entirely and for a moment Skyla thought he may have killed her, however the flames vanished after a moment and Beatrice was left standing with singed clothes and burned hair, with a look of pure astonishment and fear on her face. She took a small step backwards, before suddenly turning and running away with a loud scream.“Whoops, er, didn’t mean to do em that big,” the man said, though he didn’t sound like he deeply regretted the action.“Anyway… I’m Hagrid,” he explained as he turned back to Skyla, “the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. You know all about Hogwarts, right?”Skyla eventually found her voice, although she was still attempting to process what she had just seen.“That’s this… witchcraft school, isn’t it?”“That’s right,” Hagrid said with a nod, “Since you’re eleven now it means you’ll be going this year to study magic, although you’re only just barely in this batch of intakes cause your birthday is at the end of July, which is why we needed to process your entry quickly to get you in on time before school starts but when you didn’t reply to-”Skyla shook her head slightly as she tried to process what was being said.“Wait, I’m sorry… I’m eleven?” she asked.“Uh, yeah?” Hagrid said with a slight chuckle, “what you don’t know how old you are? Forget your birthday or summin’? Be the only person in the world who did.”“I don’t know what my birthday is, no-one does.”He chuckled slightly as he thought that she was pulling his leg, however he slowly realised from her serious expression that she wasn’t joking.“You really don’t know?” he asked seriously.“Well you just said it’s the end of July, so… I guess I know that much now,” she shrugged.“The 31st of July,” Hagrid said with a nod, “crazy that you don’t know that. Practically a public holiday in the magical world! And, the happiest day of your parents’ life, I’d wager.”“You know my parents!?” she said with shock as she stepped forward several paces.“Well… yeah I knew them,” he said blankly, “but… you know all about them, right?”“Not a thing,” Skyla said, “Beatrice said they were probably drug-addicts who dumped me at the steps, it happens from time to time-”“WHAT!” Hagrid bellowed loudly, causing Skyla to shrink back in fear.“I’m sorry!” Skyla said quickly, though she didn’t really know what she was apologising for.“You really, you really don’t know about them?” he said as he tried to lower his voice after startling her.“No…” Skyla replied carefully, “… should I?”“Your parents were two of the finest people who ever lived,” Hagrid said flatly.“Were?” Skyla asked as she picked up on the implication, “meaning they aren’t alive any more?”“No…” Hagrid said quietly, “they died a decade ago, on the night you got that scar on your hand.”He pointed towards her right palm and with surprise, Skyla opened her hand and looked at it.“How did you know about that?” she asked, confused.“Everyone knows about tha’!” Hagrid said with a laugh, “that scar is famous. Ain’t no-one out there in the magical world who hasn’t heard of Skyla Potter or her famous scar.”“Me? Why would anyone have heard of me?”“Well, you were the one who brought about the fall of… You-Know-Who,” Hagrid said, though he lowered his voice at the last part, “I was there, you know. I took you back to Dumbledore after… well, ‘it’ happened. I… I might have told a few people at the pub later about what had happened, but… well, we were celebratin’, you see.”“I don’t understand,” Skyla said in confusion, “who are you talking about?”“I guess you’re too young to know about all of that… Well, You-Know-Who was an evil wizard and your parents stood up to him at every turn. He eventually found them and murdered them… mind you, judging by the state of the house when we found you, they put up one hell of a fight. Anyway, he tried to kill you and-”“And?” Skyla asked when Hagrid didn’t continue.“Well, he died,” Hagrid shrugged, “don’t think anyone but Dumbledore knows what actually happened in there since no-one saw it, but you were the reason he died. People see you are the saviour of the magical world, ya know?”Skyla thought deeply about the story for a moment. It sounded unbelievable, yet she had just witnessed a giant of man rip the bars off her cellar door with his bare hands and engulf a woman in flames from a small pink umbrella, so…“Who is Dumbledore?” Skyla asked, “you mentioned him a few times now.”“Who’s Dumbledore?” Hagrid replied with a laugh, “why, only the greatest wizard of all time! He’s the headmaster of Hogwarts. He’s the one who sent me down here, when you didn’t reply to confirm your place at Hogwarts. Looked positively shocked when he saw the address, mind you. Never seen him make a face like that before…”“I wasn’t really sure how to answer,” Skyla admitted, “I’ve never sent a letter. Besides, it’s not like I will be allowed to go anywhere so there’s not much point in accepting.”“Oh don’t you worry about tha’ none,” Hagrid said darkly, “I’d like to see that old woman try and stop Skyla Potter from attending Hogwarts. Riots on her doorstep within a week, I’d wager.”Skyla couldn’t help but laugh slightly, “right. Riots on my behalf, sure.”“If people knew what happened here, they would definitely riot,” Hagrid said with utter confidence, “you’ll see, come on.”“What?”“Your parents have had your name registered for Hogwarts since before you were born,” Hagrid chuckled, “there’s no way you aren’t attending. Now come on, we better get you… ready. I don’t really know any magic that can help with this kind of thing, but, do you have any nicer clothes?”Skyla shook her head. She had only ever worn one of the old, grey uniforms and once Beatrice had locked her in the cellar, she had stopped giving her bigger clothes despite the fact that she was rapidly growing. The bizarre thing was that the uniform still fit somehow; it was almost like the clothes had expanded on their own as she grew. It was tattered and full of holes in many places, but, it provided some sense of comfort to her by at least preventing her from being completely naked.“Well... I guess we can go get some muggle clothes,” Hagrid said with a furrowed brow, “that will do until we can get you properly dressed. Gotta be somewhere around here we can do that.”“Muggle?”“Non-magical folk,” Hagrid explained offhandedly, “like your… Matron. Now, let’s get out of here before my back is completely done for.”With a sigh, Hagrid began the arduous process of extracting himself from his seated position on the ground. Eventually, with a rather awkward crouch-walk, he managed to get himself back out of the cellar. After a drawn out moment of indecision, Skyla eventually decided to run after him.“That’s better!” he exclaimed as he emerged with relief into the entrance hallway and stretched out to his full (and rather impressive) height. He spotted Beatrice hovering in the back behind the stairs, where she had ushered the rest of the curious children.“We’re going shopping,” Hagrid announced loudly to the woman, “she’ll be back whenever she’s back. And there better be a damn good bedroom waiting for her when she gets back. If I see any bars again, so help me-”“Whatever you want!” Beatrice squeaked out in fear as she recoiled away. She definitely had no desire to invoke the ire of the man who had just bathed her in ungodly flames and pulled iron from stone as if it were nothing.“Damn muggles,” Hagrid grumbled as he guided Skyla to the front door, “now, there are some mighty fine muggles out there, don’t get me wrong. But some of them…”He exhaled loudly as he swung the front doors of the orphanage so hard that he broke the hinges. To Skyla’s immense surprise, it appeared to be morning and it was so bright outside that she had to shield her eyes for several minutes before they could continue.“Am I dead?” Skyla asked curiously as she felt the warm rays of the sun on her very pale skin and squinted vaguely up to the sky.Hagrid simply chuckled and replied, “nah... I’d say you’re just about to start livin’.”

Skyla was experiencing an intense sensory overload as Hagrid took her from the outer suburbs of London towards the inner city districts in the sidecar of his very powerful motorbike. He had strapped a helmet onto her head that was far too big, and given her goggles that didn’t stay on at all, but she didn’t care in the slightest as she hung out of the sidecar like a excited puppy who was on its very first car ride. She eagerly drank in the sights and sounds of the city as they passed by; a playground full of laughing children climbing on shiny play equipment, towering buses that roamed past with loud honking noises and a countless number of strangers walking in all directions. Some were clearly heading to work wearing business suits or formal skirts, while others seemed to be running in sportswear for enjoyment or bringing in the newspaper while having a joyful ‘chat’ with their neighbours. Many of the people stopped what they were doing and looked as they passed by, since the tall and wide Hagrid sitting on a booming motorbike with a small girl in the side car attracted quite a lot of attention. Hagrid didn’t seem to particularly care that everyone stared at them as they rode by, so Skyla simply shrugged and ignored them too.Even as she stared out into the city with awe and inhaled the fresh air as deeply as her lungs would allow, she still wasn’t entirely sure that she wasn’t dead or dreaming. It was so surreal, and she couldn’t help the niggling suspicion that she had actually died at some point along the way. The sun was simply too warm and comforting upon her cold and pale skin, the air was astonishingly fresh to her lungs that had only ever breathed in the stale, lifeless scraps that filtered through the walls and the sky was such an unbelievably bright blue and so endlessly expansive that she realised there was no way any of it could be real. She must have either died or finally gone insane, although she wasn’t entirely sure which one was the superior option between the two.She eventually came to the conclusion that even if she had died or lost her mind, this was still far more preferable to living in the cellar, so she might as well enjoy it while it lasted.Eventually Hagrid pulled into a car park and stopped his motorbike directly outside the entrance to a rather trendy department store. A few muggles looked at him with scowls on their faces while muttering scathing words under their breath as the large and rough-looking Hagrid got off the bike while a ragged Skyla climbed out of the sidecar, however none were brave enough to actually approach the giant man about his rather creative choice of parking. Many muggles returned to their overpriced sports cars that day with strongly worded complaints to their wives or girlfriends (or both) about the decrepit state of their proud country and the filth that was ruining it for everyone.Oblivious to the devastating plight of the wild muggle, Hagrid and Skyla entered into the building and Skyla was immediately overwhelmed with the sights and sounds that struck her as she walked in. Several screens at the front displayed a variety of strange images and she could hear music playing, though she didn’t know where from as it seemed like it was all around them. There were so many brightly coloured clothes on display and the first floor of the building seemed to be entirely dedicated to clothing and accessories. She was sure she could easily spend all day looking at the pretty dresses and brightly coloured T-shirts if they had the time to spare, which she doubted that they did. Some pieces of clothing were almost painfully colourful and were quite astonishing, while others had some sort of picture on the front with a message or a logo for brands that Skyla didn’t recognise. She didn’t know how she felt about those ones, but all of the clothing was a long way from the tired, old, tattered uniform that she was currently wearing, that was for sure.Hagrid approached a young woman in a store uniform who was organising a few clothes on a free-standing display, while Skyla happily stood there and looked around with interest at anything, and everything.After a short discussion, the staff member eventually walked over to Skyla with a kind smile on her face. She was fairly young herself and had deep brown hair that was neatly tied back behind her head, with thin glasses on her face that gave her a gentle look.“Hello, Skyla,” she said softly, “my name is Olivia. Your… ‘teacher’… said that you need some help in looking a little more presentable.”“Hello,” Skyla replied with a little shyness to her voice. She was feeling quite overwhelmed already and this was the second stranger that she had to speak with today, “I… I’m meant to start school soon.”“Oh, are you starting secondary this term?” Olivia asked with a smile, “it’s quite a big step up, but I’m sure that you will love it.”There were several things that Skyla didn’t fully understand about what the woman had just said, but, she simply nodded along anyway.“Well, how about we do something to get this hair out of the way first?” she offered kindly, “then we’ll make sure you have some nice clothes for when you make all of your new friends.”On the list of strange experiences that Skyla had endured during her life, this was certainly up there as one of the oddest. Olivia gave her hair a quick brush before tying it back and guiding her to a changing room, where she was repeatedly passed several items of clothing over the door. To Skyla’s surprise, there was a large mirror in the changing room and for the first time in many years, she looked at her own reflection intently.As she stared at her frail body, even she thought that she looked very skinny and rather unpleasant to look at, and she could see why Hagrid had wanted to get her appearance sorted. When she thought about the various other people that she had seen in the store so far, she realised that she looked very worn and ratty in comparison and she began to feel quite guilty about having forced Hagrid to be seen with her. Olivia managed to provide a constant distraction from her thoughts however as the woman bombarded her with all manner of clothing.“... this one is cute, don’t you think…?”“... hm I think those two clash a bit, lets try something else…”“... Oh, it’s called a training bra and you wear it under your shirt, you see…”“... These trainers are very popular, both stylish and comfortable…”“... hm, let’s try another colour, you have such pretty eyes that I think we should build around that…”When Skyla had finished popping in and out of the changing room, after dressing and undressing many times, she finally emerged for the last time to reveal her new look.“Look at you!” Hagrid said fondly, “completely different!”She truly did look completely different after her miniature make-over. Her long black hair was tied back in a simple ponytail and held in place with a dark green scrunchie. She had a simple, clean white T-shirt with a colourful splash of green that traversed over the shoulder and a plain black skirt that complemented her hair. She had dazzling white trainers on her feet and Olivia had also given her a white training bra to wear under her shirt, along with fresh cotton underwear and socks that she had voluntarily ripped from the packet and given to the girl. She figured that if Skyla’s outer clothes were in such a state of disrepair, then, she didn’t really want to think about the rest. She’d buy the girl some underwear and socks herself if she had to.“How do you feel?” she asked Skyla with a warm smile.“I… I feel… human,” Skyla said quietly.Olivia chuckled, “I’ll take that to be a good thing, then. You can throw away your old clothes in the bin over there, unless you want to keep them. I can take the tags off the clothes you are wearing to scan them.”Skyla most certainly did not want to keep her old clothes and she found it rather cathartic to dispose of them, with perhaps a little more aggression than most people tended to have when they put things in the rubbish bin.In addition to the clothes that she was wearing, Skyla had collected a stack of various T-shirts, skirts, shorts and trousers that Olivia had said she looked good in, along with plenty of clean undergarments and a few different hair-ties in assorted colours.“Alright, all done?” Hagrid asked cheerfully.“All done!” Olivia replied with a smile, “shall we go to the registers and put it through?”“Do people normally register their clothes?” Hagrid asked curiously.“You don’t do much shopping, do you?” Olivia laughed.Skyla realised as they approached the registers that all of her new things would require payment. This was a problem as she severely doubted that she had enough money for them, seeing as she had no money at all. She had been so caught up in the whirlwind of the department store that she hadn’t considered how she was actually going to pay. A sense of dread rose within her; with how long the woman had spent helping her, how could she possibly turn around and suddenly say she didn’t have any money? She would feel utterly awful and she already felt guilty enough as it was.“Hagrid,” Skyla whispered in a panic, “I don’t have any money.”He simply chuckled in response.“Oh don’t you worry about tha’,” he said happily, “now, how much is this stuff?”“... one hundred and ten pounds, sixty five pence for the lot,” Olivia replied after working the final price out from the packaging and the tags she pulled from Skyla’s clothing, “and worth every penny, I assure you. It’s all excellent quality.”Hagrid dug into his pocket and fished out a handful of notes with a little confusion at the currency.“Is this enough?”He gave the handful of notes to the assistant, who stared down in shock at the fistful of cash.“This… this is more than enough,” she said as she realised that he had given her a multitude of fifty pound notes, “in fact… this is way too much…”“Oh? Well, then keep whatever is left for your help,” Hagrid said happily, “you certainly earned it.”“There’s no way that I could-”“I insist,” Hagrid said with a nod, “you’ve been very helpful. Now, we best get on with things, a lot to do today and time’s tickin’.”“Wait, I can’t accept thi-”Hagrid wasn’t listening as he picked up the bags of clothes and guided Skyla back to the motorbike with her purchases in hand.“She was nice,” he said airily as they departed the store, leaving behind the flustered assistant who was still holding more money than her entire weeks worth of pay.“Alright, next stop, The Leaky Cauldron,” Hagrid said fondly, “and a good thing too; getting a mite thirsty. Gotta be near lunchtime already. Hold these for a sec, would ya?”He handed the bags to Skyla while he dug around in his pocket, eventually taking out a small key that he used to open a compartment on the back of the side-car. He took the bags back from Skyla and placed her new purchases in the compartment for safe keeping, before sealing it once again with a satisfying ‘click’.“Where did you get all that money?” Skyla asked as she climbed back into the side-car once again.“You don’t think I earned it with hard work?” Hagrid teased slightly as he sat down on the motorcycle and the entire frame dropped several inches.“Oh, no I didn’t mean to imply-”“I’m just kiddin’,” he said with a chuckle, “Dumbledore gave me some muggle money in case I needed it. Got a few more notes somewhere if we need it, but we’ll be back in the magical world soon and we’ll be right from there. Now pop that helmet back on, there’s a good girl.”The two departed with a loud roar of the exhaust, which caused more angry scowls from the surrounding muggles, and they were soon dodging and weaving their way through traffic as they headed into the heart of London, heading for ‘The Leaky Cauldron’. From the name, Skyla had been expecting to find some kind of strange ‘witches coven’ that was down a dark lane and populated by shadowy figures who had two heads and large warts on the tip of their noses. What she hadn’t been expecting to find was a simple little pub that looked rather poor and run down, with a broken sign out the front and old windows that were covered with so much dust it was impossible to see anything through them.“Don’t let the look deceive you,” Hagrid said knowingly as he parked the bike out the front, “second best mead you’ll find in all of Great Britain here.”“Second best?”“Aye,” Hagrid said with a slight grin, “only cause the best has to be served by Rosmerta.”Skyla didn’t understand, but simply nodded along anyway.“Hello Tom,” Hagrid said airily as he led the way into the pub while Skyla quietly shuffled in behind him.“Hagrid!” the bartender called back cheerfully, “the usual?”Skyla couldn’t help but stare at the bartender; he had a large, hunched back and beady little eyes that followed their every move. He hadn’t addressed her at all, however he was clearly aware of her presence as he inspected her for a moment with a deep, appraising look.“Oh… go on, just a quick one,” Hagrid said as he sat down at the bar, as if he hadn’t been planning on having one this entire time.“What brings you around today?” Tom asked as he began to pour a pint of Hagrid’s preferred mead.“Hogwarts business,” Hagrid said with a knowing tap on his nose.“Hm… who’s this little one, then?” Tom asked as he peered over the counter and down at Skyla. She looked to Hagrid, but Hagrid said nothing and simply looked at her with a small smile.“I… I’m… Skyla Potter,” she said slowly, as if she didn’t quite believe it herself.“Merlin’s beard,” Tom said quietly as his eyes flicked down to her hand and lingered on her open palm, held loosely by her side. The pint he was filling began to overflow into the sink, to Hagrid’s great dismay, however Tom had forgotten all about it entirely. In defense of the mead, Hagrid leaned over and snatched the drink from his hand, using his own sleeve to wipe the side with a small huff at the wasted liquor.“THE Skyla Potter…? Could it be…?” Tom quietly spoke in wonder.“Did you just say Skyla Potter?” two older men with strangely coloured hats wandered across from their stools and looked between her and Tom repeatedly, “surely you jest?”Their eyes wandered down to her hand and spotted the distinctive star-shaped scar on her palm. Skyla immediately closed her fist self-consciously as soon as she realised what they were looking at, however the damage had been done.“By Merlin it IS her…” the first man said in awe, “she has the scar and look, she even has Potter’s hair. Remember? He had dark hair too, black as night-”“Aye,” the second one agreed excitedly, “and look, those green eyes! She would look just like her mother if you gave her red hair…”“Welcome home, Skyla Potter,” Tom said directly to her, cutting across the two excitable old men, “I’ve been waiting to say those words for a very long time.”“Skyla Potter…?”“... ‘the’ Skyla Potter…?”Murmurs and whispers ran throughout the small group of daytime drinkers that were suddenly beginning to encircle her. It was a little intimidating and Skyla backed up slowly from the advancing crowd towards Hagrid, who was sitting on his stool and watching on with a knowing look.“Bless you Skyla,” an old man with a rather flamboyant purple suit said tearfully as he walked up, “we owe you so much.”“Oh… um… you don’t owe me anything-”“My condolences for you loss,” another man said who approached from the rear of the pub.“I… didn’t lose anything-”“We’re all here now because of what you did, your bravery…” an older woman said as she joined the group, “Merlin’s beard, Skyla Potter…”“I didn’t do anything-”Skyla wasn’t sure what to do, so she simply looked to Hagrid for help, who chuckled slightly and downed the rest of his pint.“Alright, that’s enough of you lot!” Hagrid said loudly with a slight belch, “lots to do. Can’t have her out here signing autographs all day!”“Oh, Merlin’s balls!” One of the old men swore, “I should have brought a quill! Anyone got something she can sign for me-”“Dedalus!” Tom reprimanded, “I will not have you swearing in front of The Girl-Who-Lived.”A few angry murmurs permeated the group in his direction and Dedalus held up his hands in surrender, while Hagrid chuckled and escorted Skyla away from the group.“To the Potters!” One of the men said as he raised his beer in her direction, causing a small rallying cheer to carry around the pub as everyone raised their drinks in response.“That was bizarre,” Skyla said to Hagrid as he led her out the back into a small, empty courtyard.“Told you, you’re famous,” Hagrid said, “you best get used to that response. You’re gonna see it a lot.”“I didn’t even do anything though,” Skyla pointed out, “nothing that I remember doing anyway.”“Don’t matter,” Hagrid said with a shrug, “not to those who remember. We remember how it used to be, back then. Back in the dark days… no matter how you did it, you brought our world back into the light and those who lived through it won’t ever forget that, or forget you.”He frowned for a moment, before shaking his head to clear the thought.“But, no more of that dark talk here,” Hagrid said as he forced a smile back on his face and took out his pink umbrella. He tapped three very specific bricks on a rather ordinary looking brick wall and Skyla was astonished to see the wall suddenly begin to mould and change before her eyes. The bricks rotated of their own accord and begin to retreated back into each other, pulling away from the center and leaving an open archway in the middle.“Welcome… to Diagon Alley,” Hagrid said proudly as he held out his hand in a sweeping motion.Beyond the enchanted archway that separated the magical and muggle worlds, Skyla could see a bustling, busy street that was full of life and vigor. Groups of families walked from store to store while vendors peddled their wares on the street with catchy slogans and bold claims of never-before-seen effects. The sudden bombardment of noise startled Skyla, but she continued to stare down the alley with a growing sense of awe. The shops looked utterly magical; many of them had moving signs and displays that repeatedly performed colourful demonstrations of their products in action, while others had enchanted advertisements that quite literally grabbed the attention of the customer by reaching out and tapping them on the shoulder. It was chaotic and wild; there was so much noise and activity happening before her eyes that part of her felt a sudden, bizarre urge to run back home and lock herself in the dark cellar. Yet at the same time, she was in awe of the unusual place and she almost felt a giddy sense of excitement at the idea of running through the alley and looking at all of the strange and wonderful things on display.“Now, before we get you any of your school stuff, we best visit Gringotts and get some money,” Hagrid pointed out, “that’s the bank, the white building down the end there.”“Alright, but I don’t know how I’m going to pay for-”“Like I said, don’t worry,” Hagrid said with a slight smile.The bank was on the opposite side of the alley which meant that Skyla got to have a brief look at many of the strange displays in the windows along the way. It was all very fascinating and she couldn’t believe just how bold and busy everything was; it was as though every possible product or shopfront was competing to be the loudest, the most colourful or the most obscure. Unlike the grey and desolate world that she had known within the orphanage, this world was full of constant noises, sound and colours yet the people didn’t seem to bat an eyelid at the excitement and merely busied themselves from one shop to the next, deeply absorbed within their own needs and wants.“Here we are,” Hagrid said as they reached the large marble building that had ‘GRINGOTTS’ written on the front in big, bold letters made of what appeared to be solid gold. Skyla thought that it was rather absurd for anyone to throw that much gold into writing their business name out the front in such an elaborate display of wealth and excess, even if it was a bank. She briefly wondered if anyone had ever tried to steal the golden letters, but since they were still there, she figured that there must surely be a reason that no-one had made off with them yet.They stepped inside and unlike the chaotic, whirling crowds in the street outside, the inside of the bank was neat, orderly and exceptionally clean. The tellers sat behind elevated marble desks that towered over the customer, and Skyla was intelligent enough to realise why when she saw the various staff members walking around. They were all exceptionally short, with sharp, pointed ears and all possessed a variety of skin colours, ranging from an almost human pink to a few that were very dark green.“Goblins,” Hagrid whispered quietly to her, “very temperamental, but excellent with numbers. And spears.”“I guess they want to remind people who is in charge,” Skyla whispered back as she pointed between the very tall desks and the obvious presence of rather dangerous looking weapons that lined the walls behind them.“Well spotted,” Hagrid said, rather impressed at her perceptiveness, “goblins have a very… complicated history with magical folk. A lot of bad blood there.”“But they control the money? And magical people don’t mind that?”“Well... like I said… complicated history.”They stopped talking as Hagrid led them up to the front counter where a goblin was stamping pages on an unknown document.“Hello,” he said cheerfully to the goblin, “got someone who wishes to claim a family account.”“And that would be?” the goblin asked, without looking up at them as he continued to work.“Skyla Potter.”Apparently she was famous among goblins too, as a chorus of whispers suddenly rang out among the staff and she spotted a few goblins running off into other rooms, presumably to tell other goblins about who had just arrived at their bank. She shook her head in disbelief at the sight; it was just simply unnerving for so many people to know her name when she had only just learned it herself.The goblin before them however didn’t seem to have quite the same reaction as the others, though he did stop his stamping to peered down at the two.“And does Miss Potter have her key?” the goblin asked pointedly.“Ah, no she doesn’t,” Hagrid said quickly, “her parents had the key you see, and no-one knows what they did with it, but you can get her a new one, can’t you?”“Perhaps,” the goblin said as sat back and peered down at her right hand, “if she is who she says she is.”After a moment, the goblin turned around and whispered quietly to someone behind him, who immediately ran off through a side door. A minute later, a different goblin emerged and walked around the front desk to visually inspect Skyla. He had quite dark green skin with intense, jet black eyes and he intimidatingly stared at her for a moment, before he eventually jerked his thumb in the direction of a side-door to their left, clearly indicating for her to enter it.Skyla shrugged and she began to head over towards the door with Hagrid in tow, however the goblin held up a hand, causing them to stop.“Only she can verify her identity,” the goblin said firmly to Hagrid, “you must wait out here.”“Are… you gonna be okay alone, Skyla?” Hagrid asked with concern.Skyla shrugged hesitantly, “ I… guess... this doesn’t, uh, hurt or anything does it?”“Only at first,” the goblin said with a vindictive grin as he bared his teeth and lightly pushed the now much more concerned Skyla into the room before closing the door behind her.Skyla’s head was swimming with images of strange torture devices, iron chains and all manner of creative contraptions that her over-stimulated imagination generated as she entered, however she was surprised to see that inside the room was merely a marble desk with a few chairs and some parchment in the middle with a black quill resting on top.“Sit,” the goblin instructed as he indicated toward one of the customer chairs, while he moved around to the other side of the desk and sat on a slightly taller chair. The almost petty action amused Skyla, despite her concern about her current predicament. She sat down in her allocated seat and waited patiently for him to continue.“Before you is some parchment and an enchanted quill,” he said dryly, “you simply need to write your name at the top of the parchment and the enchantments will do the rest.”“That’s it?”“That’s it.”With a shrug, Skyla took the strange quill and, using it as she would a ballpoint pen, she started writing her name in shaky letters.“Ow...!”She felt a sharp pain on the back of her hand and she was surprised to see that blood was appearing on the page instead of ink. She quickly realised that several small, shaky cuts had appeared on the back of her hand which perfectly matched the letters that she was writing.“Oh? So that’s how it works…?”The goblin leered at her for a moment, however in the end she shrugged slightly and continued. It was a little painful, but it wasn’t actually all that bad. She watched with fascination as she continued to write out her name, and in her own handwriting the cuts formed a messy, ‘SKLYA POTTER’, on her hand. It began to rapidly heal as soon as she stopped writing, and she almost felt a little disappointed at having the words fade from her skin.She placed the quill down when she was finished and the goblin picked up the parchment, inspecting it closely.“Do I… need to do anything else?” Skyla asked hesitantly.“Merely review your assets,” the goblin said as he handed the parchment back to her. She looked at it and to her surprise, words had appeared on the page below her writing.

I still don’t understand what that means.”“You will be treated as ‘matured’ by goblins and the bank, for better… or for worse,” he said with a small, vicious looking smile that showed his sharp fangs.“Humans have their own laws about such matters,” he added with a shrug of indifference, “but that matters little to us. When it comes Gringotts’ gold, our law is absolute.”“Now,” he continued, “your accounts have been kept active through the automatic subtractions of our account keeping fees that your parents established. If you wish to cancel the automatic subtraction you may do so, but you will be responsible for ensuring that the appropriate fees are paid on time.”“I… whatever you think I should do?” Skyla said, unsure. She was feeling incredibly overwhelmed and she didn’t really understand what he was saying. She had once found a fifty-pence coin and she had struggled for weeks about what to do with it.“It would be logical to maintain the automatic subtraction,” the goblin said flatly, “the rest is a listing of family assets, which have all flourished healthily within the last ten years due to a booming post-war economic growth, and your mother’s particularly sharp investments.”Skyla’s head was reeling as she tried to process what any of that actually meant. The goblin used words that she had never heard before and she found that she could do little more than nod along in confusion.“I think it best that we show you to your vaults,” the goblin said, “you can withdraw some money if you desire while you are there too.”“O-Okay…”It was all very confusing and Skyla didn’t feel particularly connected to any of it. The strange words and numbers meant nothing to her and the only thing that she had paid any attention to on the parchment had been the names of her parents, listed below her own. Seeing her own name next to theirs had made everything sudden feel very real, and very daunting. She didn’t know what she had expected when she came into the bank, but it hadn’t been this. Her head spun painfully as she tried to process any of it.She was so distracted and lost in thought as they left that she was hardly even aware they had regrouped with Hagrid and were taking some very strange mine-carts down into the underground levels of the bank, guided by the goblin as he directed the cart at a ludicrously high speed. To Skyla, it hardly felt any different than being in the side-car of Hagrid’s motorcycle, yet he looked extremely uncomfortable and rather ill as they aggressively zoomed down along the extremely thin small rails.They arrived at their first destination and Hagrid had to take a moment to hover nauseously over the side of the cart. Skyla was okay however, and so she stepped out onto the platform with the goblin.“Vault 687,” he announced as he ran his long finger down the center of the vault entrance, which caused the many locks and gears to start turning and twisting loudly behind the solid iron doors. The doors slowly pulled apart in the middle to reveal an exceptionally large vault that Skyla was able to walk into, though she hardly had any space to move around. Within the vault were towering piles of gold coins that formed an almost endless sea of wealth. It was an utter mess, yet the swarm of money was up to her shoulders in height and she could have easily swum in the coins if she had so desired.“The vault requires a re-count,” the goblin said as he shuffled some coins out of the way with his foot, though more simply fell back from the pile in their place, “but that required authorisation as it will cost you to do so. Your dividends over the years have been dumped here by the vault staff and, as you can see, there is no requirement for the private exchange of gold to be stacked neatly or tidily, it merely need be the correct amount, with the Gringotts fee deducted.”He kicked some of the gold with his foot in attempt to push it back into the pile, however all he succeeded in doing was spilling more over the floor in front of them.“There has been a lot of coin placed in here over the years,” he added, unnecessarily.Skyla thought that he seemed rather annoyed as he looked around at the vault. Perhaps it was simply the fact that it was messy, while the rest of the bank was spotlessly clean and efficient.“I would certainly recommend a re-count,” he said as he looked around distastefully.“Sure, go ahead,” Skyla said with a shrug. She felt more like it was his money than hers as she didn’t even know it existed until now. She didn’t really mind what he did with it and she privately wondered if she might prefer to not have to deal with it at all.“Very well, I shall organise it immediately upon your departure,” he said in an almost happy tone. Well, as happy as any goblin was capable of sounding.“You should take what you’ll need for today,” Hagrid, who had finally recovered, said as he rejoined them and peered into the overflowing vault with awe, “do you mind if I take the replacement for the muggle money we spent earlier to give back to Dumbledore?”Skyla shook her head, “take whatever you want. Really, please do.”She was surprised when Hagrid only picked up a small handful of coins and stashed them in his pocket.“You don’t want some more?” Skyla asked.“That’s plenty,” he said with a dismissive wave of his hand.“What are these even worth?” she asked as she picked up a gold coin and inspected it. It was quite heavy for a coin and it did have a rather nice feel to it as she weighed in her hand.“One gold galleon is worth 21.43 pounds stirling at the current muggle exchange rate for gold by weight,” the goblin recited flawlessly, “and one galleon is worth 17 silver sickles, while 1 sickle is worth 29 bronze knuts.”Skyla furrowed her brow as she tried to process the numbers. It had been a long time since she had done any math practice.“There must be millions of pounds in here then,” Skyla realised eventually, “why is there so much money? Where did this all come from?”“The Potter family is an old family that has been building this vault for generations,” the goblin pointed out, “and your parents added their own sizable wealth to the vault after your father’s parents died and he became Head of House, not long before you would have been born. In addition, your mother was a clever investor and co-developer of a range of magical products, to which she took shares in the business instead of outright pay.”“I didn’t know that part,” Hagrid said in surprise, “I thought Lily made and sold potions.”“She did,” the goblin said, “in addition to investing and consulting on the side. She was in high demand for her charms expertise and enchantment abilities. I distinctly remember them arguing within my office over whether she should take direct gold or business shares as payment for her work. Businesses were failing across the country and shares were being sold off left and right due to the war. She insisted however and it paid off, once the economy had begun to rebound following the defeat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. She was certainly very clever and she was a pleasure to work with.”Skyla ignored the complicated business matters and instead asked about the main thing that had gotten her attention.“You knew my parents?”“I have managed the Potter accounts for my entire matured life,” the goblin said flatly, and Skyla almost thought she could hear a sense of pride in his voice.“That’s really cool…” she said with a smile, “what’s your name?”The goblin blinked for a moment before replying, “Krylk is my face-name.”“Face name?” Skyla queried.“The name given to me by Gringotts so as not to scare customers with my earned name,” he sneered slightly.“Earned name? I don’t understand,” Skyla said apologetically, “sorry…”“Goblins must earn their name through a great trial or notable deed when they reach maturity,” Krylk explained, “either through combat in the arena or through war against our enemies. Since we have not been to war in some time, most earn their names through the arena, although there are more nameless among us now than there ever has been before in goblin history.”“I know what it is like being nameless,” Skyla said quietly, “and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. I sometimes think it is worse than dying.”“Indeed,” Krylk said with some surprise in his voice at her words, “it is truly a tragedy for a goblin to live their entire lives as a nameless. A glorious death is far better than a nameless life.”“What is your earned name?” Skyla asked curiously. She kind of liked the idea of earned names, as devastating as it might be to not have one. At least with an earned name, it wasn’t up to someone else whether you had one or not.“Bleeding Eyes is my earned name,” he sneered slightly with a rather sadistic grin that showed his sharp fangs, “for the tears my final arena opponent wept when I tore out-”“Alright that’s enough!” Hagrid said quickly, looking almost as green as Krylk, “she’s too young to hear stuff like that.”Skyla wasn’t overly concerned however. If that was his name, that was his name; only made better by the fact that he had earned it himself.“I think that’s a great name,” Skyla said, surprising him, “if that’s the name you earned, then it’s the name I will call you, Bleeding Eyes. You are not nameless and you shouldn’t be treated as such.”He stared at her in astonishment for a moment, however he eventually bared his teeth and gave her a genuinely smile after that, which was almost more terrifying than his dangerous looking sneer that he had displayed earlier.After filling a moderately sized coin purse that Bleeding Eyes had provided for her, he led them onward to the next vault, number 921. Inside this vault there was no gold; instead, as the vault doors peeled away and revealed the contents, Skyla found an assortment of strange items scattered all around the vault, seemingly organised by category due to the small, hand written signage next to each pile. The items didn’t look particularly valuable or overly interesting as most appeared to be things like walkers for young children, tricycles, free standing mirrors, hair brushes and more.“This was a vault opened to house your mother’s experiments,” Bleeding Eyes explained, “she was working on adapting muggle products and technology for the magical market, though I believe she ran out of time before she could complete her projects.”“This all belonged to my mother?” Skyla asked in awe as she slowly walked over to one of the piles of odds and ends.“Some of it is unchanged and harmless,” he said, “but some of it is experimental or potentially dangerous. I would advise you not to touch anything until it has been certified by a consultant, which Gringotts can provide… for a price.”Skyla nodded and left the items alone, although it wasn’t as though she had intended to disturb anything anyway. Instead, she walked over to the small little signs that were propped up against wooden frames in front of each pile, as if they were an artist’s easel. They certainly felt like precious artwork to her as she slowly ran her fingers over the parchment of one of the signs, and carefully inspected the beautifully constructed words. She knew that this had to have been her mother’s writing as she doubted that anyone else would have created such beautiful signage for what was likely perceived by most as mere rubbish or waste products. From the little that she knew of goblins so far, they didn’t strike her as an overly artistic culture. Her mother had flawless handwriting and each letter was crafted lovingly with long loops and delicate flourishes that made even the simplest of words a wonderful expression, full of vibrant personality. Skyla knelt down in front of one of the signs and gently traced a long flowing ‘L’ with her own finger. She felt tears begin to form in her eyes as she imagined her mother kneeling in the very same place, though she knew not what she looked like, using ink and a small, thin brush to carefully write out the signage for her passionate projects that no doubt had big, expansive plans.Skyla had never felt a particularly strong desire to know who her parents were before. She had been mildly curious, of course, but something about kneeling where her mother knelt and tracing the letters she had drawn out years ago made Skyla’s heart yearn painfully in a way that she didn’t know was possible. She felt a sense of sudden loss for the first time in her life as she realised that she would never be able to speak with them about any of this. She would never see how her mother constructed her perfect brush strokes, nor ask her father about how any of the vaults worked. A single tear dropped down onto the old, tired parchment in front of her as she rested her forehead against the frail wooden frame and tried to stop herself from completely falling apart.“We need to keep moving,” Hagrid said regretfully after a few minutes, “you can always come back here another time.”Skyla sniffled slightly and nodded, eventually getting back to her feet with a soft sigh. A handkerchief appeared beside her and she took it appreciatively, although surprisingly it was Bleeding Eyes who handed it to her without looking at her.“Thanks…” she said quietly, though he didn’t quite meet her gaze.“We goblins do not have family in the same way that you do,” he said to her as he gazed off absently into the vault, “but we do understand loss and grief better than perhaps anyone.”He turned to her and finally met her emerald green eyes with his own. His black eyes burned with a malice that Skyla had never seen before, and she could feel a wave of intense emotion radiating from his core.“Turn your pain into anger and your loss into vengeance. Defend the names of those who died earning them.”She stared at him in surprise for a moment, however he said nothing more and returned to the cart in silence, waiting for her to gather herself and rejoin him.After another high-speed cart ride, with Skyla finding herself completely disoriented and utterly lost, they arrived not at the main entrance as she had expected, but at a third and final vault. Hagrid was so nauseous by this point that he simply hung over the side of the cart and heaved his pint of mead down into the depths below.Bleeding Eyes opened the vault door that had nothing more than the number ‘4’ on the front and, surprisingly, he revealed what appeared to be a completely empty vault. As Skyla stepped forward and peered around in the empty space however, she noticed that there was a single letter lying on the ground; a single sealed letter, that looked absurdly out of place as the only thing in the large vault.“Your parents opened this vault in secret,” he explained quietly to Skyla, “they paid a hefty sum to ensure that it was protected with the most secure enchantments that money could buy, and your mother added her own on top of our own extensive warding. It took our vault staff six months to build and ward, and they no longer remember constructing it. No eyes but your own will penetrate this vault and only myself and the director know its location. If we die, its location will be lost with us.”“All of that, just for a letter?” Skyla asked curiously.“I have no idea of the contents within the vault,” he said with a shrug, “it was not my place to know, only that the vault upkeep is paid for and that the vault remained secure.”“You don’t know what’s in here? But… it’s right here.”“I see only a few stacks of gold, a few pieces of mediocre artwork and some family heirlooms,” he replied, “exactly as intended. I imagine your friend sees much of the same. It looks completely and utterly uninteresting to me.”Skyla stepped into the vault with awe and picked up the lonely letter, which had her name on it in the exact same handwriting that she had just tearfully traced. She thought about opening it on the spot, but she decided to take mercy on Hagrid and allow them to finally leave the deep underground labyrinth which was clearly giving him no end of trouble, physically and mentally. She emerged from the vault with the letter in hand and Krylk offered her small backpack that he had, once again, managed to pull from nowhere.“You can store any amount of items in this bag,” he explained briefly, “it is bottomless and impervious. It will be useful for holding your gold and your shopping.”“Oh?”Skyla peered down into the bag, but she only saw an impenetrable darkness inside.“That’s… pretty cool!”She slipped the letter into the backpack along with her coin purse, before placing the bag on her back and tightening the straps to fit.“Thanks,” she said, giving Bleeding Eyes a fond smile.“Not a problem,” he replied airily, “I’ll charge it to your vault, along with the handkerchief. And the tour. And the history lesson.”Skyla ogled him for a moment, until she eventually realised as he bared his teeth that he was making a joke. She couldn’t help but laugh and shake her head slightly at him in response, although it wouldn’t be until much later in life that she realised just how rare the interaction she had with the goblin had been, and that she had just joined a very exclusive list of magical people who held something no amount of wealth and influence could ever truly buy; a goblin’s respect.“Alright, let’s get out of here,” she said with a sigh, “I think Hagrid is going to pass out.”“Don’ worry ‘bout me…” Hagrid groaned out quietly, “I’ll… I’ll be right…”Despite his words, he seemed positively relieved when they had finally said farewell to Bleeding Eyes and departed the bank. He eagerly gulped in the fresh air as colour returned to his face and a renewed sense of energy radiated through his body.“Right,” he eventually said as he slapped his face lightly, “now that’s over with… let’s go get your school stuff. We still got a lot to get done today.”Skyla shrugged and let him lead the way, with her overflowing coin purse at the ready and a large shopping list still to be obtained.It had been quite the productive day and for the first time in her life, she felt as though she may just have a place within the world after all.

Skyla and Hagrid had burned through a significant portion of their available daylight by the time they had finished at the bank, so the two were slightly hurried as they began their magical shopping. They certainly had enough time to get everything done; however they still needed to be mindful of the gradually setting sun that was slowly, but steadily, making its way down towards the horizon.Shopping in the magical world turned out to be a significantly different experience for Skyla than what she had experienced with her (very limited) muggle shopping. Unlike the anonymous crowds that filtered through London without a word, it seemed that most of the people in the magical world were very familiar with each other and most witches or wizards regularly stopped to greet old acquaintances or work colleagues along the way. The people in the alley all wore strange and brightly coloured robes and some even wore tall, pointed hats with striking patterns or prints upon them. Some of the strangers even spoke to her occasionally; offering casual warm greetings in passing or asking questions about her well-being, though they did not ever seem to wait for an answer.Skyla was in awe as they made their way through the various shops in the alley and browsed through all that they had to offer; large pewter or iron cauldrons for brewing potions (which, for an extra charge, could be conveniently shrunken down for transport), strange insects and unusual plants that were used as ingredients for exotic potions, glass phials and scales of all sizes along with strange tools that were used in ‘alchemy’, whatever that was. She even saw a shop that exclusively sold broomsticks, of all things, though they didn’t enter it as it wasn’t required for first year students (in fact it was the complete opposite and first year students were not allowed to own their own brooms).“Right, we’re making good progress now,” Hagrid said as he squinted up towards the sun to roughly gauged their remaining time, “I think we can afford to stop for a spot of lunch.”From the way that Hagrid was licking his lips and looking in the direction of The Leaky Cauldron, Skyla suspected that it wasn’t purely food that he was interested in, but she said nothing about it as she followed him back through the magical barrier into the pub.“Done already?” Tom, the bartender, asked as he spotted them walking back in from the rear courtyard.“Just hoping that you haven’t closed the kitchen yet,” Hagrid said eagerly, while guiding Skyla over to a table in the corner.“Well for Miss Potter, the kitchen here is always open,” Tom said with a smile.“Oi, what about me?” Hagrid asked indignantly.“You still haven’t paid off your tab,” Tom pointed out.“Ah well, you know…” Hagrid said airily. Tom just rolled his eyes slightly.“What would you like?” Tom asked Skyla, “anything you want, Sam can whip it up for you. Isn’t that right?” he called out behind him.A noncommittal grunt came from somewhere out the back.“Well in that case, I’ll have-” Hagrid began.“Not you,” Tom said briskly, “you can have a bowl of chips until you actually pay off your tab. Now, what’s it going to be, dear?”“Oh…”Skyla hadn’t been prepared for such a question, so she defaulted to the easy way out.“I’m… not hungry… thank you…”Her stomach rumbled loudly at the mere thought of food and Hagrid raised a questioning eyebrow toward her.“But, I mean… if you have an apple that you don’t mind parting with…” Skyla added after a moment.“An apple?” Tom scoffed, “that’s not a meal. Look at you girl, skin and bones. SAM!” he shouted suddenly, “give her the works! And make it special!”“I’m meant to be finis-” a gruff sounding man began to call back, but Tom cut him off.“Just do it!”A few grumbles came in response, to which Tom and Hagrid both chuckled at. The grumbling murmurs made Skyla feel absolutely awful however and incredibly wracked with guilt.“I’m so sorry!” she said, feeling rather ashamed of herself, “I didn’t want to cause any trouble. I really don’t need anyth-”“Huh? Oh, don’t worry about him,” Hagrid said dismissively, “I’ve known Sam for years. Grumpy old bugger but he’s got a heart of gold really. Same with Tom.”The two sat in silence for a time as Skyla shifted uncomfortably in her seat. Thankfully, she still had a coin purse full of galleons so she could at least pay for it all, even if the money still didn’t really feel like it was hers. The purchases so far had all felt so impersonal as she was simply buying things off a list that she didn’t make, for a school that she didn’t really know, with money that she didn’t understand. Sitting in a pub and buying an afternoon lunch however felt very different as it felt more like a personal expense; something unnecessary or selfish, that Skyla was not used to in the slightest.“What’s on your mind?” Hagrid asked, noticing that she was very distracted. She had no idea how to put any of her thoughts and feelings into words however.“It’s all just… a bit overwhelming,” she said quietly.“Well, we’ve only got a few more things to get,” Hagrid said kindly, “then we’re finished.”“That... that doesn’t make me feel a lot better,” Skyla admitted, “I… I’m not looking forward to facing Beatrice.” Her heart began to race at the thought of the confrontation that was no doubt waiting for her when she got home. Part of her just wanted to bury her face into the worn and tattered chair and never leave.Hagrid frowned slightly at her obvious discomfort, but said nothing further about it.Eventually, the mysterious Sam arrived and brought out their food. He was quite a large man, not as large as Hagrid, but still quite tall with a large belly that protruded out through his grimy apron that looked as though it may have once been white in colour. He had a poorly kept beard (that looked to be more due to a lack of regular shaving than any adherence to a particular style) and he looked a little rough and dangerous, however Skyla was distracted from all of that by the plates and bowls of food that he was floating out towards them with his wand in hand.“What is…?” Skyla began in confusion.He floated the half-dozen plates and bowls down onto the table that were all filled to the brim with piping hot food. Skyla had never seen anything like it before and she curiously stared down at the strange assortment of items, none of which she recognised.“This, this is too much…” Skyla said in shock.“Hm? Ah d’n worry ‘bout it,” Sam said with a sniff, “I hear that we did well pretty well today ‘cause of your arrival.” He indicated to the booths on the far side of the pub where a group of old men were snoozing softly in their seats, surrounded by empty mugs and pint glasses. It appeared that her former cheer squad had continued their celebration and ended their own party rather early from a very excessive amount of alcohol.Sam retreated back into the kitchen without another word and left Skyla staring down at the food before her. Her mouth was watering in a way that she didn’t know it could, and the smell was invading her mind and overwhelming her conscious thought with a delirious giddiness. Each plate had something different on it; one plate had two, thick, juicy-looking cuts of steak that were both steaming slightly into the air while another had two positively gigantic burgers that Skyla knew she would never be able to fit into her mouth. There were bowls of salty deep fried chips, crispy roasted vegetables coated in herbs, thickly battered onion rings, and even a large bowl of very creamy-looking pasta that had bacon, cheese and two large forks twisted into the middle. Skyla didn’t even know what most of the food was; she was almost content to just simply look at the display in admiration as she didn’t even know food like this existed in the first place.“I thought I was just gettin’ a bowl of chips?” Hagrid asked Tom who had wandered over with a pint of mead in one hand and a glass of a strange orange liquid in the other.“Yeah,” he said seriously as he pointed out the bowl of chips, “see? That one is yours. The rest is hers.”“She’ll never eat all of that.”“Well, whatever she does with the rest is up to her.”“Told you, heart of gold,” Hagrid said fondly to Skyla as he reached forward and picked up the pint of mead with eagerness while pushing the other strange drink in her direction. Skyla was still slightly confused as to the interactions between Tom and Hagrid; she didn’t understand the two at all, but then, she didn’t exactly have a lot of experience with human interaction to fall back on.Without touching anything, Skyla took out her coin purse and began picking out coin after coin.“I’m sorry for troubling you,” Skyla said quietly as she held out a fistful of galleons to Tom, “is this enough to cover all of this? I have more if you need it.”Tom waved her off however.“Ah, I’ll hear none of it,” he said airily, “you’ll never pay me a coin in this establishment, Miss Potter.”Before she could protest any further, he had departed and shuffled his way back behind the bar, where he continued to wipe down the counter with a small, self-satisfied smile on his face.“Gon’ get cold,” Hagrid indicated towards the food from around his own mouthful of burger that he had already dug into.Skyla carefully picked out one of the hot chips from the bowl and sniffed it like a wary fox, to Hagrid’s amusement. It smelled salty and it was quite warm in her hand, so with small, careful bites she nibbled lightly at the end of it. The end was crispy, crunchy and it had a satisfying texture as she nibbled away with a growing sense of euphoria. She was surprised when she got to the middle to find that the inside was quite soft and fluffy, which contrasted nicely with the crunchy exterior.“This is delicious!” she exclaimed.“It’s just a chip,” Hagrid laughed.It wasn’t just a chip to Skyla however, it was a brand new experience and she excitedly picked away at the various plates and bowls of food, taking a little of everything and trying it. She needed some help with the steak as she wasn’t sure how to go about cutting it, and she stuggled to figure out how to get her pasta onto her fork, but when she did… it was heavenly. She didn’t know whether all the food here was this good, or whether it was just Sam’s food that was this good, but she adored it either way.Due to her constant state of near starvation, which her magic had only just barely managed to compensate for, it didn’t take long until she was feeling fuller than she had ever felt in her life, despite having only had a tiny portion of what was available.“Go on, have some more,” Hagrid said encouragingly, as she stopped eating and sat back.“I couldn’t eat anything else,” Skyla said with a shake of her head, “that’s more food than I have ever eaten at once. I think I’m going to burst.”Hagrid blankly stared at her following the statement, since she hadn’t eaten very much at all.“Alright,” Hagrid said with a hesitant shrug, “well, if that’s the case…”He polished off the rest of the food in her stead, while she watched on with surprise at the sheer volume of food he could consume at once.While Hagrid ate the rest, she sipped lightly on her strange drink. It was very sweet; far too sweet for her, but she appreciated it all the same. She wouldn’t be inclined to drink it regularly and she probably would have rather been given a glass of water, however she was certainly wasn’t going to bring it up and she had no desire to ask for anything more when she had already been given so much.“Okay, Hagrid said after he polished off the last morsel, “just gotta use the men’s and then we can head on.” He got to his feet and gave Tom a nod as he walked past, which caused a sudden thought to appear in Skyla’s mind.“Mr Tom, sir,” she said as she approached the bar once Hagrid had departed.“Just Tom, my dear,” he said with an amused smile.“Oh, sorry. Well… I know you said you didn’t want any money,” she said quietly, “but do you think I could at least pay whatever it was that Hagrid owed you?”“Oh, that. I just like making fun of him,” Tom laughed, “I don’t actually mind about all of that. He’s been a good friend for years, I’d give him a few pints even if he didn’t pay it back.”“I’d still like to pay it,” she said insistently, “at least for his sake. Please.”Tom peered at her curiously, but in the end he simply shrugged at her desperate expression, “if you insist.”Skyla grabbed her coin purse and began dumping gold coins onto the counter, however Tom simply plucked out a few and pushed the rest back across to her.“Done, all even,” he said with a smile.“That’s it?” Skyla asked incredulously.“He owed a few pints,” Tom laughed, “he didn’t buy the property.”Skyla shook her head at the strange currency and the odd concept of wealth that magical people had, however she at least felt slightly more comfortable now that she had given something back, even if she still didn’t feel it was ‘all even’ at all.“Alright, ready to continue?” Hagrid asked as he returned, to which Skyla nodded. With a brief farewell to Tom, the two headed back out into the alley for the remaining items on their list, though both were walking slightly slower due to their well-fed state of being.“Now, this one over here is where you’ll get your wand,” Hagrid said as he pointed out a rather unassuming shopfront, “you go on inside, this is somethin’ you’ll have to do on your own, but Ollivander will look after you. I got something that I need to do while you’re in there anyway.”He clasped her briefly on the shoulder before turning and heading off down the alley. With a slight shrug, Skyla stepped through the old, worn door that chimed gently as she entered.No-one appeared to be inside upon her entry, and she looked around to find that it was a rather small and desolate shop that was slightly unclean. A thick layer of dust was visible upon the counter and a few scattered cobwebs in the corners gave the building an almost abandoned feeling. If there was anyone here, Skyla couldn’t see them and she wouldn’t have been surprised to learn that no-one had been inside within the last fifty years, judging by the state of disrepair. A small chandelier hung overhead, however only a few of the candles were lit and it simply made the place feel more eerie with the soft, gentle orange glow, since the windows were so covered with dust and grime that they hardly let any light into the building at all.“Hello?” Skyla called out hesitantly.No-one responded at first, however after a moment an old, frail man with wispy, grey hair and a rather worn face peeked out from around the corner at the back of the shop, appraising her through his thin, half-frame spectacles.“Ah…”He stopped what he was doing out the back and slowly made his way to the front counter with a rather unreadable expression on his face.“Skyla Potter… the time has come at last, I see.”“You know me?” Skyla asked in surprise. It was obvious that most people in the magical world knew her name, however she had quickly realised that if she hid the distinctive scar on her hand, people didn’t seem to recognise her from her face alone. All except for this strange old man.“A spitting image of your mother,” the man, who must have been Ollivander, said with a knowing look, “the same confused eyes that reflect a deep pain. The same posture that screams of loss and burden. The same energy that hides something deeper, something… different.”“Uh…” Skyla wasn’t really sure what he was saying, but then, she was starting to get used to that feeling by this point.“Hold out your dominant hand,” he instructed. With a shrug, Skyla complied.“Left-handed, hm?” he said with a hint of surprise, “interesting.”She hadn’t been gifted with many chances to practice her writing, not since the early days of Beatrice’s home schooling. Even when she had been writing, she had very quickly learned not to let Beatrice see her using ‘the devil’s hand’, or her pencils and crayons would be quickly taken away. She had never understood why it had been so bad to use her left hand for things but it simply felt more natural to her this way. Bleeding Eyes hadn’t said anything at all about her using her left hand when she had written her name, yet this old man seemed rather fascinated by it; it must have been a human thing she realised and she unconsciously withdrew her hand at the reminder of how different she was to everyone else, in every way. He had seen all that he needed to see however since he turned away to rummage through the shelves, while a measuring tape appeared and did a rather good job at distracting her, since it was floating around and taking all kinds of measurements on its own that seemed very unnecessarily and irrelevant. What possible use could the distance between her nostrils serve?“Chestnut and dragon heartstring,” Ollivander said as he handed her a long, thin wand made of a very smooth and clean wood, “ten and a half inches.”She took the wand from him and simply stood there in confusion.“Well? Give it a wave,” he instructed idly.She loosely waved the wand in no particular direction and the counter in front of her proceeded to burst into large flames.“Aguamenti,” Ollivander said in an unconcerned tone as he casually doused the flames with jets of water that poured forth from his own wand, while Skyla backed up quickly in shock.“I’m so sorry!” Skyla exclaimed with despair as he extinguishing the flames, although once the flames had disappeared, it turned out they had, surprisingly, caused no visible damage at all.“Think nothing of it,” Ollivander said absently, apparently lost in thought. He disappeared to the back of the shop and Skyla very carefully put the wand down on the counter as if it were an explosive waiting to detonate.“Red Oak and unicorn hair,” he said as he handed her a different wand, “nine inches.”She very reluctantly took the slightly shorter, maroon coloured wand and gave it a small wave. Nothing happened at all this time (to Skyla’s relief) and Ollivander simply took it back with a frown.“Hm… I wonder…”He departed and once again returned with another wand in hand, however that was even worse than the first one. As soon as Skyla took it from him, she let out a yelp of pain as the handle burned her hand and she was forced to drop it entirely.“Curious,” he said, seemingly to himself, “I thought that one might… given the circumstances… well, no matter…”He continued to hand her wand after wand that either had a disastrous effect when waved, or no effect at all. He seemed to be growing frustrated as he began to work his way through some of his rarer stock, though even those did not have the desired effect. “Maple and unicorn hair!”The bright, almost orange coloured wand did little other than shoot a small tuft of smoke into the air.“Sycamore and dragon heartstring!”The light green and slightly jagged wand refused to co-operate, and to Skyla’s shock seemed to jump right out of her hand of its own accord.“Applewood and phoenix feather?” he asked questioningly, sounding slightly desperate by this point, “ten inches. An old project of mine; imported wood with very strange properties… not unlike the girl in front of me, I suppose.”Skyla thought that this wand was definitely the prettiest of the wands so far, at least. It was a soft, pastel pink that had been sanded and worked down into a very smooth and clean texture, with a detailed and precise coating applied to the outer wood that gave it a gentle shine whenever the dim candlelight in the shop reflected off the surface. Where Ollivander had gotten the wood, she didn’t know, but she adored the colour and the obvious detail that had gone into its making.It was when her fingers closed around the smooth handle of the delicate piece of refined wood, however, that she knew.“It’s this one,” she said immediately, without even needing to wave it at all. The wand felt incredibly exhilarating to hold in her hand as she could feel the charged currents of magic crackling through her fingertips. She had felt something loosely similar before; when she had first touched the letter from Hogwarts, however this was a feeling on an entirely new level. She had felt a small shock at the touch of the Hogwarts letter due to her body suddenly reacting to the unfamiliar magic, however this magic felt very familiar and it felt as though she had known and used this wand her entire life. Shivers ran up her spine as her body tingled and physically responded to the strange calling of the wand. She inspected the wand in her hand with curiosity, sensing that the magic emanating through it was vastly different than the kind of magic she had been doing on her own thus far. Feeling rather adventurous due to the sudden rush of euphoria and finding an odd sense of trust in the beautiful wand, she decided to wave it.At first it seemed that nothing was going to happen, just like the other wands, however Ollivander and Skyla both let out matching gasps of surprise as the messy and dusty shop suddenly began to spring to life before their eyes. The dust on the counter began to whirl itself into a neat little pile in the corner, the cobwebs were blasted away by an unknown force, the various wands that she had tried thus far suddenly floated in the air before packing themselves neatly into their boxes and even the few indoor plants on the windowsill that were looking limp and lifeless began to brighten and look rather vivacious and lively. The windows set about cleaning themselves and by the time the room had stopped moving itself around, it looked like an entirely new shop; the comforting afternoon sun was streaming in from the outside through the now flawless windows and Ollivander almost looked slightly blinded by the sudden flood of warm light.“Woah,” Skyla said softly, “I didn’t know I could do that.”“Very unexpected,” Ollivander admitted, “that is magic well beyond the usual experimentation of children. A single spell cast in confusion, fear or anger is very common, but to use several advanced spells at once…?”He peered at her intently and she could almost feel his eyes burning straight through her own.“It seems that your mother’s talent for charms resides within you as well,” he said slowly, “I expect great things from you.”Skyla shifted uncomfortably in front of him while he simply stared at her, before eventually clearing her throat in an attempt to move on.“How much do I owe you for this one?” she asked as she clutched the light pink wand to her chest in a protective manner.“Hm, I’m not quite sure just yet,” he said thoughtfully, “as I said, it was a bit of an experimental project that I constructed years ago and I hadn’t expected to sell it until now. Phoenix feathers are exceedingly rare of course, but I was interested to see how they would react with the unusual wand wood.”Skyla reached into her bag and pulled out a fistful of galleons that she spilled out onto the counter.“Will this do?”Ollivander stared at the money on the counter in surprise.“Yes, I suppose that will do,” he said regretfully, although the way he immediately begun to scoop the coins into his hands suggested that he may not have actually been all that upset about the sale.“Do I need anything else?” Skyla asked as he counted up his coins, “or is that it?”“Oh of course there’s more my dear, there’s a whole range of accessories you can buy to go with your new wand,” Ollivander said eagerly, “made by yours truly. I’d recommend a holster and a cleaning-kit. The cleaning kit ensures that you don’t accidentally discharge any magic while caring for your wand and the holster attaches to the inside of your off-hand for easy access. You just place the wand in reverse, like so- and then you can draw it quickly as needed. In addition, you can also purchase…”After a brief demonstration, and a significant amount of up-selling, Skyla stashed her new wand into her holster that wrapped around her right forearm with a sense of satisfaction. There was a definitive sense of comfort and reassurance that came from having the wand pressed against the inside of her arm and Ollivander pointed out that when she is wearing robes, which were typically long sleeve, she will have an edge over anyone who has to dig around for their wand between the layers of the billowing and flowing clothing. Those few seconds could be crucial and Skyla could ensure that she always had the edge by merely needing to draw her wand out from her wrist at any moment.“That is, of course, if worst comes to worst,” Ollivander added, “and I do hope that you never find yourself in such a situation.”She was grateful for the additional items and she was in love with her new wand already, however she was starting to feel rather fatigued from the strange old man and she was quite eager to move on. She paid for her accessories and with a final look at the unusual wandmaker, she exited the shop to find Hagrid waiting outside.“All done?” “Yeah,” Skyla said absently, still a little lost in her thoughts, “he’s… a bit strange, isn’t he?”“That he is,” Hagrid chuckled, “but there aren’t any better wandmakers in the country. Perhaps in all of Europe. Go on, let’s see it then!”Skyla revealed her wand and Hagrid gave a low whistle of approval.“I haven’t seen a wand that looked like that before,” he said curiously, “that looks pretty rare. Make sure you don’t lose it.”“How come you don’t use a wand?” Skyla asked as she stashed her wand away and they headed for their next destination.“Ah, well… technically I’m not supposed to use magic,” he said quietly.“Why?”“I was expelled when I was at school,” Hagrid said with a dark look, “and they snapped my wand.”“Who did? The school?”“The Ministry,” Hagrid explained, “The Ministry of Magic oversees our laws and use of magic. They have the power to arrest, imprison or snap the wand of anyone in the magical world, if they are convicted in the Wizengamot. Since I had no magical family and I hadn’t finished school, I couldn’t keep my wand.”“Can’t you just buy another one?” Skyla asked, not really seeing the problem.“I would be arrested if they knew I was using one,” he said sadly, “I’m not allowed to use magic at all. I don’t really need magic to do my job at the school anyway, but… it would be nice…”“That seems cruel,” Skyla said with a frown, “to be in the magical world but not be allowed to use magic. You have to look at something you can’t have every day.”“Ha! Well, you say that now,” Hagrid chuckled slightly, “but you aren’t allowed to use magic outside of school either, once you start your first day. You’ll be in the same boat as me.”“But I’ve been using magic already?” Skyla asked, confused.“Accidental magic is different,” Hagrid pointed out, “when you are young you are allowed a bit of leeway until you start school. After that, you can be expelled like me if you use magic at home.”“Is that what you did?”“Well, not exactly,” Hagrid said evasively, “but, let’s not talk about such things today.”“Oh. Okay.”“Come on, let’s get your books.”Skyla’s favourite shop of the day was, without a doubt, the incredible bookstore that they visited to obtain her school books. Unlike the strange and disturbing wand shop, which had been sombre and eerie (until Skyla had unwittingly decided to change things), this one was still quite full and lively as people popped in and out with armfuls of all kinds of books. The bookstore itself wasn’t overly large, yet it wasn’t small by any accounts either; it was a two-story building that had a wide, open staircase to their left as they entered, and both floors were filled with rows and rows of books. Thick leather-bound textbooks, small and dainty journals, feature-length hardcover novels, shrunken pocket-guides; they were all to be found within the bountiful supply of endless knowledge held within the colourful rows that Skyla excitedly rummaged through.“This looks really interesting!” she said as she eagerly picked up one of the novels, “‘The Adventures of Cane Wright and his Hell Hounds’. Sounds intense!” “Oh, this could be really useful,” she mused as she inspected a thick and slightly dusty textbook, “a thousand spells that you never knew you needed… how am I going to know if I need them otherwise? I better get it…”“A guide to magical beasts?” she considered thoughtfully, “some of these look dangerous. This could be useful to have, especially since I don’t know much about this world…”Hagrid watched on with amusement as Skyla happily browsed the many books that were available, her arms steadily filling with book after book.“Are you opening a library?” Hagrid joked as he eventually helped Skyla take her school books, and her personal selection of books, to the front counter.“I love books…” Skyla said quietly, “I would buy the whole shop if I could.”“Well you probably can…” Hagrid pointed out, “… and you basically have.”Skyla gave him a slightly sheepish smile as she fished out her coins to hand to the assistant. She was starting to get more confident with this shopping business, although she still handed the assistant far too many coins. She happily tucked the many books into her backpack, already thinking about how she might hide them to protect them better than the books she had once let down…“So it’s just robes left,” Hagrid said as they left the store. Thankfully, Skyla’s bag was still holding steady and she didn’t notice the weight at all, although she moved her coin purse to separate pocket to ensure that she could actually find it. She was quite impressed with the very useful bag and she wondered privately just how many coins that Bleeding Eyes may have charged the Potter vault for it. Not that there was any shortage of money within her vault and it had already proven to be extremely useful. She was now, finally, starting to understand just how much money was actually available to her as she had bought so many things, yet her coin purse still had a decent weight to it, and that was without taking into account the absolutely overflowing vault that was likely being cleaned up under the eager supervision of her account manager.“There’s either Madam Malkin’s or Twilfitt and Tatting’s,” Hagrid mused aloud, “most people go to Madam Malkin’s since it’s cheaper but there’s no doubt that Twilfitt and Tatting’s are the better quality, just more expensive. Although that’s not really a problem for you now, is it?”Skyla just shrugged, “I guess I won’t be able to come back here very often will I? So I should probably get the better quality stuff, right?”“A reasonable point,” Hagrid said with a nod, “they do need to last you all year. Although I suppose you can always mail-order something if you really need it at school.”Twilfitt and Tatting’s turned out to be quite a fancy boutique on the inside, however the mediocre looking outside didn’t do well to represent the stunning interior. Most shops on Diagon Alley were made of wood and stone, with archaic styles of construction and more than a few pieces of architecture were clearly only held together with the use of magic. Twilfitt and Tatting’s seemed to be one of the only shops that had embraced tiling and modern construction materials, which led to the inside appearing very sleek and shiny from the white tiled floors and minimalist interior design. Ironically, the shop was frequented by the rich and the elite within the magical world, yet the interior design seemed to be based upon the layout of high-end muggle stores. Perhaps it was because the noble elite were so far removed from the muggle world that they would never know the ‘creative’ designs (both of buildings and clothing) were being borrowed from the very people they often despised.At first Skyla thought that they might be only customers in the shop, however she spotted two women standing in the corner, apparently waiting for someone who was changing inside of a small, curtained off area. Skyla and Hagrid walked over towards them, since they both figured that one of them must be the staff member.“-amount of muggleborns,” one of the women was in the middle of saying as they approached, flicking her long blonde hair in apparent annoyance, “increasing every year. Very soon there will be none of us left, and all of our traditions and history will be lost forever.”“Oh yes, hm, I see,” the assistant replied in a placating tone. She was of a similar age, however she had shorter brown hair and while the first woman carried herself with elegance and dignity, the assistant looked rather tired and perhaps a little bored of the conversation.“Mother this doesn’t fit at all, it’s far too tight!” A boy’s voice huffed loudly from inside the changing room.“Well come out and show us, I can’t do anything from out here,” the woman with the blonde hair (and the boy’s apparent mother) called back.The boy emerged from the changing room and Skyla was surprised to see that he had strikingly blonde hair, just like his mother’s, although much shorter in length. He was quite a handsome boy really, however the scrunched and annoyed look on his face did his appearance no favours as he emerged and pointed down towards himself.“Look!”His mother inspected the boy and his black robes closely, however she merely tilted her head slightly at the sight.“Look’s alright to me,” she said after a moment, “the stitching could use a lot improvement and the fabric is clearly on the cheaper side of things but, what can you expect from Diagon Alley. You have to be accepting of some things here, Draco, as distasteful as it is.”“Well I certainly-”The boy stopped talking as he noticed the presence of Hagrid and Skyla standing slightly in the back.“A GIANT!” He suddenly exclaimed in a very loud voice, “in Diagon Alley? Aren’t your kind illegal? How grotesque!”The women turned and were both startled at first by the presence of the large man behind them, however the boy’s mother seemed to recognise Hagrid and her initial surprise turned into a sneering and disdainful look.“I didn’t know you sold to rabble like this,” she said with an exaggerated sniffle, peering down her nose at the pair, “and what is this… thing, Hagrid? Find another creature to adopt? You always did choose bizarre pets.”Draco cackled with laughter at his mother’s comment, though Hagrid swelled with anger in response. Skyla simply watched on in confusion, not really sure why everything had turned so hostile, so quickly.“Don’t you dare speak of her like that,” Hagrid warned angrily, “she’s worth a thousand of you, Narcissa Malfoy, and not just in money.”“I highly doubt that,” Narcissa sneered in response, “she’s clearly muggleborn and she looks like she hasn’t eaten in weeks. Are you even feeding your new pets or do you just leave them to starve? Do I even call the aurors on you two, or should I call animal control?” Draco guffawed loudly as he stared down at Skyla’s thin frame with obvious disdain, causing the girl to step behind Hagrid in embarrassment. Hagrid seethed with anger and he drew himself up to his (intimidatingly) full height as he said, “you can say what you want about me, but there are two people you don’t insult in front of me. This girl right here is one of them.”“What makes her so special?” the boy asked as he walked over and stood beside his mother, “she’s just a mudblood, isn’t she?”“She’s no-one, Draco,” Narcissa said quickly as Hagrid stared at them in shock, “they are both no-one. Let’s just get out of this dump before we have to wash out their stench.” She took out a few coins and roughly pushed them into the assistant’s hands.“See that the additional robes are actually mailed to the right address this time, won’t you?”Narcissa appeared to suddenly realise that she had immensely angered a seven foot half-giant that she was currently inside a building with, so she wisely guided Draco around Hagrid’s gradually inflating frame and quickly darted for the door.“You… you…” Hagrid said as his voice trembled with anger. They didn’t wait however and quickly ran off, sensing his impending explosion of outrage.“What was all that about?” Skyla asked, feeling rather baffled and out of the loop.“The Malfoys,” Hagrid scoffed angrily, “they think they’re so much better than everyone else because they’re what’s known as ‘pureblood’; people with magical ancestry that they can trace back for generations. It’s all codswallop. There wasn’t anyone who didn’t start as a muggleborn at some point anyway, even when you go way back. I can’t believe they said that, though…”“They’ve said much worse than that before,” the assistant said with a sigh, “but despite their criticisms they always shop here and always spend a lot of money, so I can’t really afford to anger them. It’s frustrating, but there’s not much I can do about it. Well… anyway… how can I help you?”So far, the magical world had seemed to be made up entirely of sunshine and rainbows to Skyla, however between the strange behaviour of the goblins, the elitist nobles that she had just seen insulting her and the strange laws regarding the management of magic, she was starting to get an idea that maybe there were a lot of things happening in the magical world that went far beyond the surface image. Still, it wasn’t as though she was any stranger to being insulted so she brushed it off very quickly and easily, unlike Hagrid who took quite awhile to calm down. The shop assistant was quite sympathetic however and she did a very good job of calming Hagrid down (while also upselling more than a few additional items at the same time). Skyla ended up walking away with several sets of robes in different colours (in addition to her black school robes), as well as dragonhide gloves, dragonhide boots and a variety of accessories that she got talked into. “It’s soooo cute! It goes with your wand too! That’s super adorable!” “Oh that matches your eyes, you look much older and more mature with that!”Perhaps the Malfoy order had been nothing but boring, simple clothes, as once the assistant had discovered that Skyla liked bright and colourful clothing, she had almost become more excited than Skyla was. In the end, she spent far more gold than she had anticipated on clothing, although given her personal stake in the stop it was, at least, theoretically discounted (not that she considered that in any way).It was with a bittersweet feeling that Skyla walked back down the alley for the final time towards The Leaky Cauldron, knowing that her adventure had come to an end and it was time to return to the orphanage.“This has been wonderful,” Skyla said quietly to Hagrid as they reached the magical barrier, “very strange and completely overwhelming, but wonderful. Thank you.”Hagrid chuckled, “oh, it’s not over just yet.”Skyla looked at him questioningly, but he said no more as they walked back into the pub once again.“Ah, Tom,” he said happily, “is everything all sorted?”“All sorted,” Tom said with a nod, “here you go.”Tom handed a key to Hagrid who took it with a grin, before he turned and handed it to a surprised Skyla.“And… here you go,” he said in a satisfied voice.“Huh?” she asked in confusion.“Third floor, room nine,” Tom said with a mischievously smile.“... Huh?”“Everything is ready for you,” he said, “it’s all yours until you leave for school in September.”“What do you mean?” Skyla asked.“Hagrid explained your situation,” Tom said with a nod towards Hagrid, “he said that there was some trouble at home or something like that. Well, I won’t let Skyla Potter live unhappily in the muggle world, not while I have a roof and a bed to spare. I can’t offer much in terms of living conditions; the pub can be noisy and busy sometimes, but I can offer a safe and secure room with regular meals. From the sound (and look) of it, that’s more than what you’ve been getting, at least.”“... is that what you were doing when I was getting my wand?” Skyla realised as she turned to Hagrid.Hagrid grinned slightly, seemingly quite pleased with himself, “I was going to go and get you something else for your birthday present but… this seemed like a better idea. Unless you want to go back of course, you don’t have to stay he-”He stopped talking as Skyla impacted with his side like a missile, wrapping her arms around him as far as she could reach in an attempt to hug the large man. Her eyes had begun to fill with tears at the thought that she didn’t need to go back to Beatrice and the cellar; she had been so worried about how she would possible return to that life after discovering that all of these wonderful things were awaiting her in the magical world. She never wanted to leave again and even if it was a cardboard box in the corner of the bathroom, she would gratefully live in it if it meant being able to stay in this place. Hagrid patted her gently on her head as she sobbed softly.“I have a whole vault of gold,” Skyla eventually mumbled out to Tom, “you can have it all-”Nonsense,” Tom said with a smile, “the entire magical world owes you their lives. If not for you, the children of this generation would have all grown up in a far worse environment than whatever you did, I can assure you. You don’t owe me a single coin.”“I… I promise I won’t be a bother at all, you’ll hardly hear from me and I don’t need much, you can put me anywhere you want and-”“Relax,” Tom said gently, “it’s not a bother at all. I had a few spare rooms anyway so you really aren’t imposing. Just… don’t expect too much of the room, they were only ever meant to be overnighters for the truly intoxicated.”Skyla needed several minutes to sit and calm down before she could even be guided to her room, which Hagrid used to fetch her muggle clothes from his motorcycle, in case she wanted to use them to explore muggle London at any point. With her backpack and her clothes in hand, she was led up to the third floor and Tom used his master key to open the door for her.Skyla had been expecting something similar to the bedroom at the orphanage; a single bed against the wall with perhaps an old wardrobe and a broken window if she was very lucky, and she had been positively thrilled at the idea. She had disliked the old bedroom in the past, but after her time in the cellar, even that would now be an absolute dream come true. What she found, was (to anyone else) a very ordinary guest room that had a double bed, two old bedside tables, a simple wooden desk with a rather rickety chair and a slightly cramped en-suite attached to the room, where a small shower had been squished in next to a toilet and sink. The room wasn’t overly clean, but Tom had tried to sweep the floor and dust a little bit at least, though the carpet was very old and damaged and the small window that overlooked Diagon Alley was still quite rusty and covered in cobwebs. For most, it was a mediocre stay at best, almost exclusively used for a big night that involved too many pints and a disgruntled spouse at home that didn’t want to be disturbed in the early hours of the morning.“This is incredible!”To Skyla, it was an absolute palace and she couldn’t even believe that she had this entire space to herself. It was the biggest bed that she had ever seen in her life and there was not only one, but four pillows for her to use in addition to a fitted sheet, flat sheet, woolen blanket and an old, but very cosy-looking comforter. The thought of sitting at the desk and reading through her books (or even possibly doing some writing) filled with her with a sense of hope and she could even open the window if she wanted to (and even close it when she wanted to). She earnestly thanked Hagrid and Tom once again for everything, and she practically begged Tom to let her pay something towards it, anything, but he just waved her off with a smile before he departed, telling her to get herself settled in.“Alright then, so I’ll see you at school,” Hagrid said fondly, “remember; King’s Cross station, platform nine and three quarters, first of September, eleven o’clock. Give yourself plenty of time ‘cause you don’t want to miss the train!”“I won’t,” Skyla promised.Hagrid gave her a final smile and squeezed out through the door frame, leaving Skyla alone in her new room.She stared at the double bed for a moment, hesitating, but eventually her caution gave way to excitement and, with a gleeful giggle, she ran forward and dove on top of the covers. She snuggled herself into the soft and comforting bed, sighing loudly at the luxuriously soft and cloud-like embrace as she rolled into the blanket like a cocooned caterpillar.Tom and Hagrid both smiled slightly from outside the closed door as they listened to her excitedly laughing and enjoying her moment. Their smiles eventually faded however as they met each other’s eye and headed down to the bar.“She’s very troubled, that one,” Tom said as he poured Hagrid a pint, “you should have told me earlier how bad she had it.”“Didn’t have a chance until she was in Ollivanders,” Hagrid said regretfully, “I don’t think she’d want people to know how she lived, you know?”“Yeah, I get that,” Tom agreed, “and I won’t tell a soul, but… she’s gonna need help. More than I give.”“I think what she needs is to just live a little, be a happy kid for a change. What better place to do that than in Diagon Alley with a vault full of gold?”“I must admit I was very surprised when you first asked if she could stay here,” Tom said, “this isn’t really the place for a little girl to live, you know, and she can’t stay here forever.”“Trust me Tom,” Hagrid said darkly, “she is better off here than where she was. We’ll work something out for her during the school year.”“Who’s idea was it to put her in that, what did you call it? Orpha-range?”“Orphanage,” Hagrid corrected, “and that’s something I’m very curious about myself.”He downed his pint and began to rummage through his pockets for any money of his own that he had buried in the corners, however Tom just chuckled and stopped him.“She paid your tab off, you know,” he said with a smile.Hagrid blinked in surprise, before he laughed and looked at the stairs with a strange sense of fondness and sadness for the girl.“She doesn’t really understand money, or much about the world at all,” he said ruefully, “I worry for her at school.”“At least she’ll have you there to help her, eh?” Tom said with a chuckle. Hagrid privately wasn’t that he would even be that much help, since he was technically just a groundskeeper. He shrugged and downed his pint anyway, deciding to worry about that later.“Alright, I best be off,” Hagrid said with a sigh, “gotta go talk to Professor Dumbledore about more’n a few things now. Put that one on my tab then,” he winked as he passed his empty pint glass to Tom, who rolled his eyes with a hint of a smile.After Skyla had spent some time excitedly rolling around on her bed, or inspecting the bathroom, or swinging slightly on the rickety chair, she had eventually begun to pull out her various magical items, one by one, and set them up around the room. She followed her instructions for her new cauldron and tapped it with her wand, which caused it to immediately return to its full size. She decided to place it in the corner, along with her stack of books that she had no idea what to do with. She didn’t even know what she was supposed to do with a cauldron, but, she had a bought a pretty looking one at least and it was very new and shiny.Eventually, she had emptied her backpack of her new clothes and magical items, and finally pulled out the letter that was still sitting at the very bottom. She had almost forgotten about it in all of the excitement of the day, yet now, she took it to the bed and lay down on her stomach, staring at her mother’s handwriting on the envelope with a growing sense of apprehension.She gulped slowly as she gently broke the seal and took out a very long, double sided letter, written entirely in her mother’s beautiful cursive hand writing. It took Skyla a bit longer to read than usual because of it, but she loved the style regardless.‘To our beautiful baby girl Skyla,’… was as far as she got into the letter before her tears returned and she had to take a moment to recover herself once again.‘If you are reading this, then it is because your father and I are gone. We are so sorry to leave you in this world without us, but we hope that you being alive to read this means that our plan to bring down Voldemort was successful, and that you have grown up in a loving and caring home, among our friends who we know will love you and cherish you just as we would have.And, that Sirius has kept his promise of never taking you on that damn motorbike. If you are reading, Sirius, you better not have endangered my precious girl on that flying death trap.In order to keep you safe from Voldemort, we have placed a very powerful rune within your hand. This wasn’t an easy decision for us; I have done a lot of experimenting with ancient runes and alchemy and it is never without risk. I can only hope that you aren’t experiencing any negative effects from it. You may experience some difficulty with your magic, or you may experience some phantom pain; I can’t really be sure what will happen as no-one has experimented with this kind of magic in the way that we have. It was a necessary sacrifice I’m afraid in order to keep you safe and I can only hope that it hasn’t caused you any undue stress. It is a single use, highly-charged shielding rune that I have overpowered with our blood; if we are no longer alive, then its power will be increased a thousand-fold. It will protect you from the darkest of magic, though it will only react to the most powerful of spells, and it will only activate once. We are putting all of our hopes into this defense, and I can only pray that he is foolish enough to act as we suspect he will.We have left everything we own to you, without exception. If my investments have gone as planned, you should have a healthy account to play with. We don’t want you to be greedy, nor to lord your wealth over anyone else, but we do want you to use it, sweetheart. Your father grew up with that vault and he said that all they ever used it for was a… throwing contest with other families. Slightly paraphrased.Anyway, I know that Sirius, Remus and Peter will look after you so if you have any questions you can always ask them. We trust them to guide you in our stead, to instill the values of truth, honesty and integrity within you.‘They better guide you right, or I’ll haunt them for a thousand years,’ - your father. Sigh.I think that you may also like to know why we called you Skyla. We haven’t told anyone this as this is just for you to know when the time is right; we called you Skyla because you represent endless possibility and unlimited freedom, just like the sky promises us every day as we look out of the window of our little cottage we share with you. We shaped your rune like a star because you are that bright light in the darkness for us, and whether it is night or day, I know you will shine.(Your father would also like you know that ‘la’ was his addition and he is very proud of that.)(‘At least she’s not another _ constellation,’ - also your father.)Goodbye my beautiful daughter. We will always love you; whether from beside you, or in the sky above you.Mum and dad.’Skyla thought that she could hear the rain gently tapping on the roof above her, however she soon realised that it was the sound of her own tears falling gently upon the old parchment that she cradled tightly to her chest, as her fractured heart once again shattered into a thousand familiar pieces.
