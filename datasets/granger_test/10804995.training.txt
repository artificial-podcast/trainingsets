Author's notes: Just a reminder here on the Britspeak: when Harry refers to fanny, its not the backside he's discussing.  UK slang for the sweet V.

Luna didn’t attempt to extricate herself from Harry’s iron-clad clinch, merely gaped at his heated demand with her saucer-like eyes. She felt no compunction to lie to Harry; on the contrary, she had every intention to give him his answer, but the words couldn’t seem to connect to her voice. She was starting to get a little bit nervous now that she was up close and personal with the Chosen One’s notorious temper. Their posturing was near enough for her to feel his racing heartbeat thudding into her chest like hooves. It was the wrap of his arms around hers secured tightly to her back and the hardness pressed into the apex of her thighs that caught Luna’s senses, however, and she let her mind linger over the pulsing between her legs at the thought of him pinning her to the floor.   “It started with a few Ravenclaw boys, if you must know. Marcus Belby and a couple of his friends caught me coming back late to the common room after curfew one night. I had been out to the lake to leave some treats for the Giant Squid. We’d had treacle tart that night and it’s one of his favorites. He was very happy I visited.” Luna’s attention wavered as she rambled and her gaze shifted to Harry’s neck. The bulging cord coursing down his throat throbbed, the vein standing out in a purplish bas relief. “The boys didn’t seem to care about that, though. They told me I would have to pay them a favor if I didn’t want to get reported. And so I did. They were quite particular, you know, but acted pleased afterwards, so I expect they…um...they enjoyed it.” Luna faltered for a moment as Harry’s hot breath lapped over her. He was almost panting now and it sounded like he might be grinding his teeth, but his dark, emerald gaze never left hers.   “They left me alone after that, but I guess Marcus must have said something to a few Slytherin students,” she grimaced at Harry’s imperceptible squeeze on her wrists, “Their group cornered me near the entrance to the Forbidden Forest not soon after. There were more boys this time. It was mostly,” she paused again, preparing herself for what was sure to be an explosive reaction, “well, it was Draco Malfoy and his lot, I’m afraid.”   Harry didn’t disappoint.  “WHAT?!” he blasted into the night.

 His wild eyes flashed an emerald fire before shutting tight.  “That fucking, low-life, piece of… SHIT.”   Gnashing his teeth viciously, he suddenly let go of Luna as he raised himself to his feet. She fell back against the stone while Harry began pacing, his fingers flexing in and out as he tried to control his need to strangle someone. That someone being a white-haired ferret fuck who was destined for a world of hurt when Harry finally caught up to him, he thought darkly.   Harry ceased his steps and turned towards the dirty blonde. She lay crouched where he’d dropped her. His mind couldn’t seem to process what he was hearing and some part of him shook in denial. “You sucked Malfoy’s prick?” his hardened voice inquired tonelessly, needing her confirmation before he could manage to wrap his mind around the news. He wished that she’d never divulged her secrets to him now; he could do without these revelations. The Boy-Who-Lived had had his fill for the night, and this girl was dragging him deeper into the abyss. At her timid nod, another wretched thought occurred to him.   “So, he raped you, Luna?”   The silvery orbs in her eye sockets did that Luna thing again, catching the light of the moon like a shard of glass in the sun. He was briefly reminded of the shining spheres along the shelves of the Hall of Prophecies. She shook her head side to side slowly and Harry let loose a breath of relief he hadn’t realized he was holding.   “None of them had sex with me ever, Harry.  He never…did that to me.”  The implication that whatever had taken place had happened more than once was not lost on the boy.   “What do you think ‘performing oral sex’ is, Luna? It’s still sex. And Malfoy and his goons forced themselves on you, right? Just because the wanker didn’t shove his filthy knob inside your fanny doesn’t make it any less of a rape.” Harry rubbed at his face as he tried to reason with her.     He justified his coarse language in the hopes of rattling her composure. The young hero wanted to see her fuming about this, not passive and accepting of their heinous deeds. Although he found the subject matter uncomfortable and distasteful, Harry felt a certain responsibility to light a fire under the girl. He could bear the rage for the both of them, he expected, and as he seized onto this new disturbing bit of crisis, images of dead, watery faces and moaning, begging Headmasters were pushed to the recesses of his consciousness. Here was a cause that he could manipulate to his sense of justice. The sniveling, pasty, reluctant assassin that Harry had felt sorry for in a moment of compassion was once again revealed as the hateful, vindictive bully he knew and despised. Harry mentally thanked Luna for restoring some semblance of familiarity to his situation. Malfoy was a thug who deserved no pity whatsoever, it mattered little that he cared for his family.   “I know what rape is, Harry, and I understand the concept of sex, thank you,” the witch explained in a remarkably bitter retort for her. “But while it was an unfortunate encounter, I was at least somewhat in charge of the proceedings. Mum would always say that you can’t hold back the river, but you can swim with the current. They may have been rather unpleasant in their demands and perhaps, it’s true, that I didn’t have much choice about the whole arrangement, but I’m the one who gave them their pleasure. They saw that. They knew who I was. Draco was pretty angry with me and my part in getting his father put away, but by the last visit he’d taken to using my surname like it was a badge of honor. He didn’t make fun of me so much anymore.”  She shook her head mournfully at Harry’s baleful glare. “All of them are just scared little boys trying to live up to their fathers’ legacies,” she imparted wisely.   “I see, so I suppose that makes it alright, then?  Did you even try to fight them?”     His curiosity waged battle with the sheer gall rising up in him with her words. He conjured forth moving pictures in his head of Luna on her knees bowing over Crabbe or Goyle (they seemed a safer choice than the ferret) while her pink tongue swirled around their cocks as her eyes darted like Cornish pixies in that dizzy gaze she held so often. Harry’s own hardened prick made its presence known as it throbbed in anticipation of her answer.   Instead of getting angry, Luna gaped at him as if he was quite daft. It was such an unusual look for her that for a moment the messy-haired boy thought he might laugh at the sight. He stifled it with a strangled cough, however, as he watched the skin on her tits glow under starlight.   “They may be sad little boys, but it doesn’t mean they’re not bigger and stronger than me, Harry. They have fists and they’re cruel and the five of them had their wands out and directed towards me. I mean, their actual wands, ready for hexing.” Now it was the ethereal girl’s turn to narrow her eyes at him in disdain. “What would you have done, o’ savior?”   Harry couldn’t understand why her biting sarcasm was getting him hotter. The girl had subverted his idea of her and flipped it several times on its head. This quirky, dejected little wisp of a thing who allowed her roommates to steal her belongings with nothing more than a sigh of resignation was somehow leading a double life as the Blowjob Queen of Hogwarts and he’d had no clue. He really needed to stop being so self-involved and start paying more attention to his friends.   Harry ignored her snarky question and turned away from her as he scanned the skies again. He could detect a faint bit of light looming on the horizon and he idled over the lateness of the hour. When he gazed back at her again, there was a quiet strength in his pose that declared his resolve in this matter. He regarded her very carefully, his hopeful plans for the remainder of this twisted night propelling him into action before the dawn could greet them.   “Are you a virgin, Luna?”    He was surprised by his forwardness, yet it persisted. Luna bent her head and cast her eyes downward demurely, but shook her head again silently. Harry noted with something akin to tenderness that there was pain in this admission, the girl’s slumped form broadcasting her shame. If his heart hadn’t already taken a beating tonight, Harry might have been able to muster some more pity for his friend, but in all the tumultuous emotions he was feeling for her right now, pity had taken a backseat to desire.    “Are you still cold?” he asked suddenly. He really didn’t want to hear the grisly details of her first time. The change in subject was noted by Luna with a raised eyebrow as she searched his expression.     Harry glanced around his feet to locate the discarded cloak and as he grabbed it where it lay he kneeled to the floor and flapped the magical material across the stones. He urged Luna to shift her rear-end onto the fabric and they both briefly marveled at the effect it created over the solid rock. It was like peering into nothingness, a flat shapeless void. As she tentatively rolled on top of the make-shift blanket, Harry cast a warming charm across its surface. “Thank you, Harry,” she smiled up at him. “I like your Hallow.”   “My what?” he wrinkled his nose in bemusement. “Nothing,” she sighed. Her nightgown had by this time slipped down far enough to settle around her waist, leaving her topless in the crisp twilight air. He scooted over to her feet and laid his sweaty hands on top of them, rubbing back and forth to bring her some heat. The teen’s eyes caught sight of pink flesh under her skirt and the tight ache in his jeans renewed with vigor. Did the Ravenclaw not believe in panties, he wondered in amazement?    “I want you to lie back, so you can get warm all over,” he directed patiently.     She immediately followed his command without question and for an instant Harry felt that ache move up to his heart. He still wanted her, wanted to fall into her sadness and weave in his own despair. The two of them had to be the most messed up people in the entire school; the bloody planet, even. Ginny popped into his mind’s eye for a split second, but he quickly dispatched her face from his thoughts. It wouldn’t do to worry about her now. The youngest Weasley had his heart, but she would never understand the comfort that he craved. He couldn’t even understand it himself. Her happy face and happy kisses and gusty challenges were like something out of a dream to Harry. He had been kidding himself to think he could belong in her world.   “Can I lie down with you, Luna?” he made a point to ask her.    His voice remained quiet and steady as he spoke. The girl merely lifted up her hand in an invitation. With a sure grip, Harry grasped the hem of his shirt and tugged upwards, pulling it over his head and glasses deftly with one hand. He tossed it to the side as he clasped her wrist and let her pull him to the ground. The boy oomphed into the iridescent cloak and a tiny cascade of giggles erupted beside him. He bore a lopsided grin as he raised himself on one arm and contemplated the figure lying next to him further. She really did glow, he mused.     Harry watched her face as his hand reached out to stroke the soft milky skin of her belly once more. This time when he bent down for a kiss, he made sure to move slowly and leisurely. His lips closed over hers in a wet, plush, spill of tongue. He licked the corners of her mouth and across her teeth, he sucked on her bottom lip and tugged, he plunged into that sweet opening to let his pink probe sweep every inch inside. She tasted of pudding, he decided; butterscotch or pecan, he couldn’t quite tell.     Luna simply let him plunder her mouth in a yielding gracefulness that spurred on his eagerness. His touch continued to appraise her flesh as he sought out her body’s secrets. Luna was ticklish near her armpits and along her collarbone, he determined, but she moaned into his mouth when his hands crept around her throat. Subconsciously, the implication seemed to do a number on his ever suffering hard-on, and he wondered if any more blood could possibly pump to the region without causing him brain damage. His fingers spread open wide as he brushed them lightly across the tops of both breasts, her nipples now hardened peaks that were driving him spare. Unbidden, he bit down on her lower lip again as he pinched one of those rosy points between his thumb and index finger experimentally, but almost exploded a second later when Luna arched up her back towards him in a deep groan. They were both practically shaking now. Harry tentatively resumed his exploration of her body, but this time when he placed his palm on her stomach he deliberately pointed downwards, and as his fingers wound their way down her pelvis like a snake in search of prey, he sucked in a gasp.     The smell of her...well, her cunt wafted over him like a summer afternoon by the lake, the salty breeze ruffling his hair and trundling up his nostrils. He thought of freshly baked bread served outside at the Burrow and ripe, bursting fruit full of sweetness and tang. He felt his whole body reach towards her core as his hand slipped under her lacy gown and dipped into salvation.   When the tips of his fingers curved over her pubic bone, the terrain became slick and more varied. Her flat belly’s smooth glide in the descent now gave way to fleshy folds and ridges with a light tickle of fuzz. It was…wet, she was very wet, was his first impression. For a scary second, Harry had thought it might be blood or urine, and his cheeks burned hot when he realized just what substance he was soaking in. The wide-eyed boy let his hand circle that forbidden flower a few times while his breath abated in awe. The bit of hair that he’d detected seemed to be exclusive to a small patch above that bony jut. He could feel thick, padded flesh run parallel on either side of her drenched center, but as his fingers moved to explore, the sleek skin parted and he gained entry in the throbbing gash. Luna moaned and writhed underneath him and Harry thought he might faint from want. Those two middle digits had plunged into her heat before he could even understand what was happening, and as it dawned on him that he was inside Luna, he mentally cheered himself on.   Feeling the velvety grip of silky muscle was a fascinating revelation for the rookie wizard. He pushed in and out a few times lightly to elicit a response, and the squelching sound of fluid accompanied the panting girl’s cries. He removed his sticky fingers and brought them under his nose inhaling deeply, the powerful scent providing another kick to his groin. Without a moment’s hesitation, he slipped them in his mouth and sucked. The tangy bite on his tongue was more than he could have imagined and he gave his ardent approval with a grunt. Oh, Merlin, he had to get out of these jeans before his weeping, petrified cock broke in half.     “Luna, I’ve really got to strip, okay?” He had his hand on his buckle before she could offer a reply. The belt was already free and his top button undone when he heard her rejoinder. He gripped the corners of his jeans and pants together and pushed down in one fell swoop, tripping backwards in his haste to slip off his trainers. The night breeze swirling around his erection cooled the burning, tender skin and he slowly exhaled in the relief. He lost any shyness he thought he might possess in his nudity and turned back to the witch with a wild fervor. He needed to feel more of her. “Let’s get this gown off of you,” he said as he swiftly reached for the lace. Luna was already lifting her hips while her feet planted firmly on stone and the two teens quickly removed the final impediment to their lustful demands.   “Harry,” the girl called to him again as he straightened up from the floor on bended knees, “Harry, look at me.” He paused with his hands preparing to spread her legs open and stared questioningly at his friend. She rolled up and curled her right hand around his bicep, the left moving to caress his cheek. Those big, glittering eyes pierced deep into his with a beseeching mixture of need and melancholy and something inexplicably haunted that brought home the horrors of that evening. The boy felt his morbid reality brush up against his back again, returning that flinty edge to his nerves. “You will be careful, please?”   Her voice rose up slightly on the ‘please’ and its plaintive sound struck an alarm deep inside the boy. Yet, he nodded with an assuring smile before something clicked in his overcharged brain and he suddenly blushed with understanding. In a halting stretch, the aching teen reached for his dungarees to fish out his wand from the back pocket. He furiously tried to recall the prophylactic charm that the twins had teasingly taught him using a green banana last summer at the Burrow. He chastised himself now for not taking better notes because he’d been too embarrassed at the time. “Um, you might have to show me the hand movement again, Luna, I haven’t really used this in practice,” he confessed.   Luna’s baffled expression suggested they weren’t talking about the same thing.  Harry tried to clarify.  “The, uh, Prophylaxis, I’ve only seen it done once before.” He knew it worked much like the Bubble-Headed Charm, encasing the caster’s ‘designated area’ in some type of protective coating, but Fred and George had insisted you couldn’t feel it at all, unless done with some augmented versions which served to heighten the pleasure involved. He was thankful that he’d had the two of them acting as surrogate older brothers, so at least he wasn’t completely clueless. His roommates knew squat in the realm of practical sexual data, he’d gleaned from their late night chats. Seamus was all talk, and lewdly so at that, whereas Dean still seemed to rely on the Muggle world for relevance. He wasn’t even going to bother wondering what Neville could possibly offer on the subject, and Ron…well, let’s just say the two friends avoided any talk revolving around how ‘bits’ actually worked. Harry couldn’t quite ascertain the nature of the discomfort in that area. They talked shite about everything else.   “You don’t have to worry about that.”  Harry’s eyebrows flew high to his forehead.  “Really?” he intoned.   Luna shook her head while her skin flushed pink. “I won’t be having any children anytime soon.” There was bitterness in her words that suggested Harry leave the matter alone. “And I’m free of any contagions that could harm you. The potions see to that. I’m assuming you haven’t been with anyone else sexually, then?”   The casual inquiry chafed at Harry’s ego and he felt a sliver of annoyance return. “Right, whatever. Go on then.” Not bothering to confirm Luna’s query, he drifted his focus back to her legs, bent in half like gates barring a glorious garden. Clutching her ankles, he pulled open those gates with a brusque jerk to either side of him. As he peered down, Harry employed his personal inner choir of angels to sing once he beheld the sight between her thighs.   The visual was almost as empowering as the tactile sensation. The golden down of her mons looked trimmed and tidy, he noticed, nothing at all like the mass of wiry black curls surrounding Harry’s heavy package. The pink folds now glistening under the moon’s beam were full with the promise of heady fragrance and pleasure untold. “I thought girls were supposed to have more hair,” he muttered curiously before inwardly cringing at how ridiculously young the remark made him sound. He had come face-to-face with monsters and crazy men, for fuck’s sake, he didn’t need Luna thinking he was a complete tosser. But Luna took it all in stride.   “One can never be too careful with Nargles, Harry,” she cautioned. “It’s imperative one remove all temptation to possible infestation.” Harry grew suddenly worried what she would think of his own unkempt bush. Then the beginning of a smirk pulled up one side of his mouth as his palms pushed her thighs further apart, ready to detail his own inspection. He dropped his face close to her core as he bent low from his waist, shifting his knees and elbows into a more comfortable position. Meanwhile, the swollen head of his cock tapped the cold stone and he leapt back from the touch.   “Uh, how about we spread this out some more,” and he pulled Luna up on her bum while he cast an Engorgio on his cloak. The material grew double in size and Harry was able to redirect their bodies in a diagonal line inside the square, his head between her legs and above her twat, while still giving him some protected space below her arse with which to lie on his stomach. “This is much better.” He felt satisfied that he was calling the shots again.   The two students both lay propped on their elbows, she on her back and he pushed up from his waist, regarding each other over Luna’s midsection. The-Boy-Who-Lived-For-This fixated on her cunt once more, deciding that the matter of taste had not been investigated fully and warranted further research. His hand palmed her pubis again and he stroked it lightly like he was petting a small kitten, delighting in the way Luna mewled at his touch while her juices slicked his fingers again. “Has anyone ever gone down on you before?” he asked nonchalantly while inside his body thrummed with expectation.   A girlish giggle caused him to look up, and he was surprised to see her grow bashful as she gazed coyly down at her breasts, her long lashes fluttering like a butterfly basking in the sun. She shook her head shyly as she murmured her answer. “No, Harry, that has never happened to me.”   He smiled devilishly. Good.   “No one has ever been interested before now.”   Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously and frowned. Well, he didn’t really want to hear that, but highly doubted it was true, at any rate. Ugh. That just made him think of Malfoy, which made him think of Dumbledore, which made him think of a bunch of shit he wanted banished from his mind. It was a good thing he had a sopping wet snatch right in front of his face to distract him then, wasn’t it? Harry decided. Yet, even as he attempted to close off that cacophony of battle sounds and protests that lingered in his ears with a determined shake of his head in order that he may fill it with the much more favorable hymns of Luna’s breathy moans, Harry felt a wash of misery sink deep in his bones. The desperation propelled him in a haphazard lunge to her crotch, until the bridge of his nose bashed into her pubic bone, his glasses digging into his cheeks.   Luna yelped as her body jerked forward. Harry swore under his breath then uttered a quick apology with an abashed roll of his eyes. He rubbed the offended area to mitigate the sting, but as she relaxed and eased into his touch once more, the boy watched as his fingers slid over that fleshy hood and settle onto a wrinkled nub of skin. Her bottom moved upwards again, but this time in a thrust for more contact. He licked the pad of his thumb before pressing against that tip and rubbed harder. Harry astonished at the way her sex seemed to redefine its shape before his unblinking eyes. This close he could see her juices secrete from her depths like the very spring of life. His tongue responded before his mind could catch up, and in a second he was licking and slurping his way into oblivion. He gulped her pearly issue like a starving man and swirled it around his mouth, mingling it with his spit then spreading the mixture back across her slit.   He could hear some kind of meandering chant from somewhere above his head, and wondered if Luna could possibly feel as hungry as he was right now. It was a high he’d never before experienced, this dominating force that hovered around him as he took control over someone else’s pleasure. With a gradual awareness, Harry felt a tightening grip around a raven lock of his hair and a tug upwards. There was a hand at the side of his face urging him back to that protected pith of flesh and he lavished it with their combined fluids as he nibbled and sucked it just as he’d punished her lips earlier. In a detached sense of analysis, he supposed her female folds were much like the lips of her mouth, and he approached the idea with relish as he increased his tempo of suction. Without stopping his worship, the boy slid his two fingers back into her swollen hole. She felt so fucking deep, he thought gobsmacked, and a guttural timbre climbed up from his throat. The girl under his power moaned in reply and Harry’s fingers pumped in and out of her with a reckless glee.   “Oh, Morgana!  Don’t stop, Harry!  More! Please!”     As Luna’s cries echoed into the lightening sky Harry could barely register the faint twittering of birds greeting the new morning. He added a third finger and pushed them as deep as they could go to the tops of the knuckles, his hand butting against her, soaked with her essence. Even amidst all the frenzied action, he felt her slickness roll down his skin in fat dewy beads. The whole of his being curved up around this mysterious girl as he let his body listen to hers, in the same way he was attuned to his broom, flying through the air like he was a part of the wind. It was an intuitive act and he drew from that well now as he heard the tiny flutters signaling the girl’s spiraling rise towards her release. He sucked hard on that nub, his mouth feeling like it was wrapped around her beating heart, and as he brought his teeth to her pulse they bit her instinctively. The sudden slam of her cunt into his waiting maw was like a bolt of lightning for the boy as her gargled scream rent the early dawn. White points of light danced behind his eyes as his scar burned in solidarity and he actively gulped down his reward from her gushing cunt.    Harry was transformed.    Luna’s crumpled body wracked with sobs and expulsions of deep breaths. The boy stared at her in a mixture of pride and veneration. He glanced down at his prick hesitantly, expecting to see his own emissions scattered over the cloth (would he even be able to see it?), but was surprised to see its still stiffened form standing in drooling attention. Harry appraised Luna again as she tried to regain control of her breathing. He supposed it was now or never.   The girl was lying with her eyes shut whispering a prayer of thanks. As he pulled closer to her face, he heard his name repeatedly in a tumbling mantra of gratitude. It felt fucking magnificent. For the first time this evening, Harry noticed the absence of her ever-present butterbeer necklace and it occurred to him that she looked different to him now. She no longer possessed the air of silliness and whimsy. She was really a young woman, one with a sexual knowing that delineated her from the other girls he knew. And he wanted to fuck her now, fuck her hard, fuck her into the ground. The chant grew louder in Harry’s head.     There was something indefinably delicious about admitting what a dirty, dirty boy he truly was at heart. It was a part of him that absolutely no one in the wizarding world had any knowledge of, all except this girl underneath him. It was a bit of an epiphany, really. He wondered again in an unfamiliar voice how far he could push her, even as he sought out ways to protect her.   He leaned down to kiss her in her afterglow, her face positively beaming in a rushing euphoria. He captured her lips again and rubbed his cum-soaked face against her own. She pulled back a little at first with the pungent aroma assailing her, but Harry reached up to hold her head in place and sighed in her mouth. He adjusted himself on top of her while settling between her thighs once more. “Open your legs more, okay?” he motioned to her and she obliged his command, those sparkly gray irises never leaving his countenance.   “Harry?”   “Yes?”   “Are you okay?” she asked in a concerned hush.   “I’m,” he searched for the words for a second, “I’m bloody elated.  I hope to be even better in another two minutes.”   “Harry?” she repeated, seemingly unaware of Harry stroking his rigid cock against her opening.   “Yes, Luna?” he responded, growing steadily irritated with this style of questioning.   “I’m sorry about Dumbledore tonight.  You must have witnessed some awful things.”   Thud.   It was as if time stopped for a moment while he held himself over the girl with his having-endured-all-it-could pecker in one hand ready to penetrate, figuratively and literally, into the unknown. This was about escape. This was about controlling one’s own fate. He didn’t need her pity. He needed a good shag. He’d thought she’d understood. That terrible fury rose up in him again and he closed his eyes to a seething mass of reds and green strikes as the night’s failures flashed in his head like lurid pictures out of an old comic book. He swallowed.   “Luna?”   “Yes, Harry?”   “For once, why don’t you shut your fucking gob.”  He plunged his ramrod prick into her wet heat and pushed deep.   Sound disappeared but for a whooshing in his ear drums as soon as he entered her. As he leaned his palms flat against the stone, he straightened his arms and used his bum like a pendulum swinging into that place of silent pulsing, while a tight pressure built up in his spine and traveled down behind his bollocks. He stared down at Luna’s blank gaze in a hungry rage. He imagined that this was what Professor Lupin might feel as he ripped at his skin while the beast burst forth. Looking in those saucer eyes was like falling into silver pools of reckoning and he tried to reach for that calm he’d had moments after her orgasm. Shame waved its red flag again and he fought it like a bull in an arena, his imaginary horns driving his head into Luna’s chest. His hands pulled up and he reached for her thighs again, pushing them wide as he rode her into the enchanted floor, her hips meeting his as he reached ever deeper, ever further for his escape.   “God, I need to get deeper. Let me get deeper, okay?!” He shouted to her in a frantic plea. “Harry, I’m trying,” came her reply, and he looked up to see that he’d pushed her legs up against the sides of her breasts, her ankles and feet flailing over his shoulders as he rammed into her. Her face was twisted in want, but as Harry stared in horror, it morphed into a cavalcade of the adults in his life molding his very existence. “Stop!” he shouted. Those ghostly masks swam before Harry’s eyes and he shut his lids against their demands and their expectations.   “You don’t own me! You don’t! I can’t be everything you want!” His voice rang through the last wisps of blackened sky as his relentless shaft searched deep in the willowy, wanton, woeful girl locked in this savage union. And as those faces taunted him, even the twinkling blue emanating from his mentor, the man who set him on this road and taught him to take back his fate, his mind whirled with the thousands of words he wanted to express. He wouldn’t hold back anymore, his destiny was calling.   “Fuck! You!” he wrenched out in great heaping sobs. Somewhere in the background of this miasma of loathing, he could hear Luna’s voice steering him back to safety. She hooked her feet tight around his neck, her toes pointing to the evaporating moon and howled while Harry hit a wall so hard his sight went white and then popped in little eruptions of light with the sound of rushing water against his senses. His cock shook its spasmodic release before floating into blissful nothingness as his body fell upon the girl.    After a few minutes of groggy silence, Harry rolled his heaviness off of Luna and lie beside her. He could see tears streaking her cheeks, but her expression was serene and sported a beatific smile. He studied her face in reverence and awe as the moment of his purging clung to him in sweat. She was a miracle, he decided. He had hold of a miracle. He knew the demons were still there, could feel them jostling for attention in his subconscious, but for right now he was sated and sane. Clarity enveloped him like a cheering charm and he smiled at Luna’s peaceful state of being.   Peace.  He could make peace with this.  He could finish the job Dumbledore had begun, no, Voldemort had begun.  Harry would find a way to defeat him.  He could feel it as sure as he felt Luna’s hand pressed into his.

Luna half-heartedly listened to her roommates sluggishly drag their bodies about the room as they dressed for breakfast in the Great Hall. Classes had been suspended and the school year was at an abrupt end. One of the girls noisily spelled her dresser empty while the contents flew to her trunk, as many parents had already begun their descent upon the castle in their haste to bring their wards home. Hidden behind the lush blue curtains of her bed, the undisturbed witch wallowed in deep reverie as her mind replayed the night’s events which had culminated in such a powerfully emotional denouement. She had never actually fallen asleep once she’d made her way back to her quarters, but she felt as wide awake now as she’d ever been in her life and reveled in the tingling sensation still reverberating under her skin.   After Harry had properly clothed the two of them on the rooftop, they’d Alohomorad their way through the exit and proceeded to shuffle their way down the long staircase, both teens quiet and lost in their thoughts. Luna retained a steady throb in her center, and her limbs burned with the ache of torn muscles, but she couldn’t wipe the misty smile plastered to her face. She kept peeking sideways at the boy walking next to her, her buoyant steps ever lighter, the corners of her mouth rising higher. It was as if she’d sprung tentacles from her chest and they weaved and hovered about his compact form absorbing the very strength he emanated like rays of the sun. She was filled up and it felt really, really good. Luna tried to remember the last time she’d experienced this kind of giddiness and it seemed very long ago.     Perhaps it was a time when her mother was alive and her father was still well. They’d been a merry self-contained unit back then, her mum’s peals of laughter always ringing through their home. In moments of jocularity, the family of three would try to outdo each other with zany escapades in an attempt to bust up the other two. The little girl would give a valiant show, but she could never match her dad’s inspired lunacy. Luna recalled fondly her father dancing a madcap jig on top of the dining room table with a fishbowl of Plimpies floating atop his head, warbling a risqué little ditty out of tune all the while. Selene had rolled on the floor shrieking in her mirth at the absurd spectacle of her husband’s act. Sometimes, Luna thought their devotion to their work in theory and experimental spellwork was really an excuse for them to find ways to prank each other in an endless ping-pong of outrageously clever design. It had been a decidedly spontaneous and whimsical household.   Not so much now, she thought, though Merlin knew her father tried. As a naturally intuitive and hyper-aware child, Luna sensed even back then the dark layer of dread that descended whenever her father would retreat to his lab for extended periods. One time he stayed in there for a month, and Selene had spoken to her daughter in hushed whispers and tight smiles while they waited it out. But he always returned from that self-imposed exile more robust than ever. Then her mother had died, the lab had been boarded up, and the resulting depression had almost killed him. The girl shuddered for an instant, the slight ebb in her rapture translating to a chill across her back. Harry had suddenly noticed her again and wrapped his still warm Invisibility Cloak around her shoulders.     “You might as well wear this to your dorm room. At least I’m fully dressed, so if someone catches me this early in the common room, I can pretend I just woke up,” Harry reasoned.   Luna delighted in the way her body disappeared from sight when she crossed the material over her arms. With the cloak back to its original size, she could just make out her pink toes wiggling independent of their host on the floor below. She turned up her decapitated head to Harry and beamed in her joy. Harry grinned back in return and not for the first time the witch noted how much beauty he radiated in that smile. Although she had to admit to herself, even when his expression looked serious and grim, she found him lovely to look at.   “Just shrink it down and return it after dinner. I’ll meet up with you outside the Great Hall and we’ll talk, okay?” Harry gave her a guarded look before his hand reached up unexpectedly and stroked her hair back from her face. His expression turned sheepish and he appeared embarrassed by his action.   “Thank you, Harry.  What time is it, anyway?” she wondered.  “I left my wand by my bed.”   “Er, yeah, I noticed,” he muttered before pulling free his own and striking a Tempus in the air watching the clockface shimmer forth. “It’s already 5:30. We won’t get much of a chance to sleep, I’m afraid, before everyone’s up and about.”   “That’s alright, I couldn’t close my eyes if I tried,” she enthused.   Harry had watched her again, his eyes gleaming, while he escorted Luna the rest of the way to Ravenclaw tower. When they had arrived at the spiral staircase that headed up to the dormitories entrance, Harry had pulled her aside into a shadowy doorway, bending down for a passionate kiss. It had taken several attempts for him to part from her lips and then he’d flipped the cloak up over her head and was gone. She had floated up to the door and just barely riddled her way in before slipping inside the Common room to glide toward her own, feeling for all the world as swift and silent as a Jobberknoll in flight.      Once she was back in the haven of her shrouded bed, she had tied the cloak around her legs, leaned back against her pillows, then pulled out her journal to jot down her impressions for an hour. This was an exercise she’d been doing since she was eight. Luna would close her eyes and breathe deeply making sure to clear her mind before letting quill hit paper to begin its scrawl across the page. She would let the ink fill the off-white space with whatever flowed out of her, no fixed thought in her head. In this way, Luna would feel assured that she could never lie to herself, the contents that spilled forth always an impetus for reflection. When the bright-eyed witch had ceased her writing for the hour, she ran her eyes over the page briefly and then tucked the bound pages away. She still managed to catch several references to ‘beautiful boy’ and ‘glittering green fire’ in her scan. The ebullience from earlier enveloped her again and she hugged herself tight to keep the feeling from releasing through her pores. Then she pulled out another parchment of loose paper and began to write to her father.   HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Harry ghosted into the Hall with the rest of the somnambulant horde. It was evident that most of the throng of students had not slept soundly after the horrific news had spread through the castle. The empty seat at the staff table loomed large like a lit throne on a dais calling attention to the loss of its king. Heads turned to the spot in a weary acknowledgment, while others stood transfixed by the space, as if poised for the arrival of their beloved Headmaster clearing up the matter of his absence as nothing more than a misunderstanding.Harry had headed down to the congregation with his friends and girlfriend in tow. Ron had awakened the drained teen from his sprawled slumber on the divan of the Common room a few hours after he’d crashed. His mate had regarded him curiously at his choice of resting spot, but made no further comment other than to suggest a good, hearty meal might be in order. Harry had to agree; he was famished. However, he made sure to shower and change before embarking for the Hall with the rest of his team. Under the steaming hot water, Harry rinsed the grime and sweat of his trauma away, as well as the musky odor of sex from his skin. After slipping into fresh clothes and his scuffed trainers, he felt like a new man, albeit one who was fairly numb.He had expected to be buried under a mountain of guilt once he’d laid eyes on Ginny, but aside from a twinge after they settled on her wistful face, he felt strangely devoid of anything. It was if he’d boxed Luna and their fevered coupling into an area of his brain that had nothing to do with the rest of his life, although he was willing to concede it was not that simple. Yet he maintained that empowered charge from last night throughout the morning and continued to draw from it like a battery. Ginny slid her warm hand around his as they clomped down the steps together and the serene smile he gave her was genuine and heartfelt.Sitting at the Gryffindor table, the foursome plotted their day around the sunny weather while they ate. Harry theorized that if there was some sort of heaven, certainly the gorgeous day was given in thanks after having one of its brightest angels returned. He knew there was still anger for the professor harbored deep in his heart, but for all of Dumbledore’s maddening idiosyncrasies he trusted that the wizard was a great man. Part of him could appreciate just how lucky he was to have had the Headmaster as a benefactor and that they’d been able to share the relationship they did. Nevertheless, his rebellious other half refused to surrender the notion that Dumbledore had chosen to keep him in the dark too long, had kept too many secrets from him no matter if it was under the guise of protection. Even after witnessing his terrible demise, that niggling doubt persisted, a resolute belief that the Headmaster had never truly come clean, that something momentous was waiting in the wings. He could feel it in his bones, more lies and secrets abounded. He expected that before this chartered course of expedition for Horcruxes ended, Harry would uncover more truth than he could stand.“Are you ready to go visit Neville and Bill in the infirmary?” Hermione inquired of Harry directly. At the mention of Neville’s sickbed, the young wizard looked up to glance over the Ravenclaw table’s occupants. His eyes zeroed in on that tumbling, straggly blonde mane almost immediately. He assessed Luna’s back as if he could ascertain her mood from behind. He momentarily wondered what it would be like to brush those tangled tresses until they gleamed. The tip of Harry’s tongue peeked out to swipe across his bottom lip. It was starting to occur to the teen that he might just have the beginnings of a hair fetish, as strands of Cho’s raven, Ginny’s fiery red, and Luna’s pale yellow locks flowed over his imaginary fingers. He carded his own to break up the thought before it got him into trouble once his visions highlighted some other places those long silky hairs could fall.“Yeah, I’m ready.  Why don’t we head to the lake after, then?” he posed.“I thought we might get a bit of studying done in the library before we can’t use it as a resource anymore, Harry. You know,” her voice quieted down to a hushed tone, “after the information you gave me, there’s a lot to research.” Hermione had that determined look on her face at the prospect of deep immersion into a table full of books for the day. She and Ron had been filled in on the letter in the locket right after Harry had dressed. He had pulled them up to the boys’ room and told them briefly what he could about the cave and RAB’s deception. He would save the rest for later.Harry felt sure in his decision to take up the path laid out for him and knew what he needed to do, but for today, he wanted to pretend he was a carefree boy just a little bit longer. There was already that knowledge tapping in the back of his brain that he would have to separate Ginny from the equation, that he couldn’t have her marked for danger by association. It sickened him that he couldn’t even be allowed a proper girlfriend, so mired in Voldemort’s perverted reach for power was he, but it wasn't as if he could claim his life had ever been proper.“Bloody hell, Hermione, fuck the library and let’s have fuck all to do with studying for now. We can work on that later.” He demanded.Hermione and Ginny both raised their eyebrows high, Ginny’s mouth in a perfect ‘o’ of surprise, while Ron tried to disguise his grin behind a cupped hand. “Honestly, Harry, there’s no need for such vulgar talk. When did you start feeling the need to use profanity all the time,” she scolded.“When I realized we live in profane times, ‘Mione,” he exhorted. He leaned over the table, looking deep into her miffed stare and intoned a litany of swear words designed to make her blush. “Arse, shit, wanker, fucking cocksucker, bollocks, bloody cunt, bitch, cack-licking bastard, bugger, fuck fucking fucker.” He then gave her a satisfied smirk. “There you are, luv, you can have a go at me all in one sitting and then we can move on, okay?”Harry began to pull his stuff together to leave, pushing his empty plate away and purposely ignoring his best friend’s apoplectic stuttering while Ron openly barked his laughter in admiration. A few students at their table gave sharp looks as if offended by their good spirits in such a time of mourning. A quick glance to the faculty table caught McGonagall’s glare as she honed shrewdly in their direction. He didn’t mean to be such a nasty git, but Hermione had to learn that now was not the time to be concerned with propriety. Ginny, meanwhile, had turned bright red while her lips tucked inwards trying to contain the mirth fighting for expulsion. Her eyes were a little dazed sweeping over Harry’s insouciant pose as he stood waiting for them to follow.Hermione still batted at his bicep with a muttered “prat” as they headed towards the large doors. The young man was unfazed. He had abstained from saying what he really felt: that watching dead husks of souls crawl out of a black lake, or watching an act of murder for the third time in as many years, or feeling your heart tatter in shreds as the strongest wizard you’d ever known fell apart in your arms had left him hard and cold in the way he saw the world. For all of Hermione’s brilliance, she still wore the idealism of youth like a talisman around her neck, whereas he’d outgrown that ability sometime around the Department of Mysteries fiasco. After the triple whammy of last night’s life-changing ordeals, he felt like the adult in their set, but not in a manner of condescension. He simply understood better than they what it meant to face evil and come out of the other side. It had marked him as profoundly as Voldemort’s curse. A certain morbid pragmatism had altered his perceptions, just nigh of fatalistic. The boy wished he could protect them from such a harsh place like a parent would, wanted to let them enjoy the last lingering remnants of their childhood worrying about Quidditch tryouts and NEWT scores, but he still needed them selfishly to keep alive his hope. Harry couldn’t indulge in nostalgia, but neither could he move forward without the support of his companions.Maybe there was something to this love thing after all, Harry wondered, because he knew that he loved Hermione and Ron without question, and he couldn’t lie to them the way he felt he had been shied from the truth. They would discuss everything at the Burrow. He just needed this little space in time before he put away the last of his childhood things, before he would send Ginny away. Instead of casting his eyes in the red-head’s direction, however, the thought caused Harry to swing a glance back toward Luna when a brief flash of her breast invaded the pictures in his head. The preoccupied girl still faced away from him.Harry clapped his hand around Ron’s shoulder, inserting the suggestion of a little flying in the sun into the trio’s banter as they headed for the Hospital wing.HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Later that evening, as Harry had detached himself from the group with the promise to meet them in the Common room after taking care of some errands, he loitered about the hallways waiting for Luna to exit from her supper. He hadn’t held eye contact with her since he’d left her in the early morning, although he’d seen her at various points throughout the day, ambling across the grounds lost in daydreams with seemingly no particular destination in mind. He’d briefly considered calling her over to their group a few times, but the idea seemed awkward and disparate. He preferred to think of time spent with Luna as his alone, and the thought gave him a nervous energy around his friends as jitters hit his midsection.The witch floated out of the Great Hall a few minutes later, those protuberant eyes roving over the students mingling outside the doors as she searched for a face. With classes cancelled, robes and uniforms had been ditched in favor of casual dress, but Luna still managed to stand out amongst her peers in her outfit of choice. She wore a peasant blouse of loose cotton, but instead of a scooped neckline, the material bunched just off her shoulder and cast a straight line across her collarbone. A bright red cross-stitched design on the front panel looked like tulips or some kind of flower and the shirt cinched snug at the waist before descending over her hips. The skirt underneath was voluminous and bright aquamarine and it fell to her shins with a bit of petticoat showing under the trim, but the fait accompli were the flaming orange high-top trainers she wore on her petite feet with checkered strings tied across the tongues. Harry also noticed her butterbeer cork necklace was back, but the radish earrings appeared to have been switched to some new shape he couldn’t make out. He decided that overall, it was quite a good look for her. He liked the fact that she never looked like anyone else, nor seemed to care whether she conformed or not. The off-shoulder top exposed just enough skin to give Luna her own brand of sexiness, he thought. He waved her over with a soft call of her name.Once Luna’s gaze locked onto his, she seemed to only have eyes for Harry as she made her graceful glide over to where he was standing. Harry felt a bit off-balance staring into those silver irises and he dropped his own eyes to course over her body. Up close, her breasts looked amazing in that blouse, he couldn’t help noticing. The realization stirred definite movement down below his waist.“Harry,” she spoke soothingly, “I have your Cloak in my bag. Do you want me to hand it over here?” Luna kept her voice to a minimum.“Uh, let’s do it elsewhere,” he suggested as he looked around, his cheeks tingeing pink at the double meaning. He grabbed her hand and pulled in the opposite direction of the swarming students as they gathered in cliques for gossip and comfort. Most would be making their way back to their dormitories to prepare for their departures the next day, right after the funeral. Harry took the girl away from the marble staircase and headed towards the first floor’s west wing. He had decided it best to take advantage of an empty classroom for their transfer and “chat” if he wanted a bit of privacy. He avoided Firenze’s bucolic room, but grabbed the handle of the door next to it and cast the spell to let them inside. The room was unrecognizable to him, but it looked similar to the Potions layout in that instead of desks there were benches and long tables. He pulled Luna inside and firmly shut the door, waving a locking charm over it before turning to the girl. Flames flickered in their sconces, casting a low light around the room.She stood there expectantly, but made no move to retrieve the item meant for exchange. Harry took a few seconds to ponder what he might say to her now that he had her alone. He felt suddenly like he was outgrowing his skin, a prickling itch running from behind his neck to a patch in the small of his back. He scratched under his hair and cleared his throat.“Well, I suppose we both have a few things to say about last night.  Did you want to start?”  Harry asked hopefully.Luna just gave him her secret smile again. He supposed he could see why some people might write off that blissed-out expression she so often wore as representing a disturbingly vacuous presence, but they’d obviously not taken notice of the shining intelligence in her eyes that always accompanied her composed demeanor. Having been privy to the variations of nuance that mouth could conduct, Harry thought he could now detect subtle gradations in her eyes and lips that suggested volumes about her inner thoughts. The girl was an enigma, plain and simple, but he was finding her a fascinating study. And he was starting to think of her ‘weirdness’, her ‘otherness’, as a big turn-on judging by his hardening prick. But he tried to steer his mind away from sex when she spoke.“Whatever you did with your mouth on my womanly parts was exceedingly pleasurable,” she opined bluntly, and that got Harry going again.“Er, that’s not exactly what I meant, but thank you, I enjoyed it, too,” he gushed. He attempted to get serious with her and cleared his throat.“Luna, I can’t even begin to express how much you, well, you really helped me last night. And I don’t just mean because of the…the sex,” his hand dithered in the air in front of him while he grappled with the words. “I felt totally out of my mind when you found me. You’re right, I was angry, but I was terrified, too. It was really rough going, like a nightmare that I couldn’t wake up from.” He looked up to her glowing face again while the girl silently bade him to continue.“But---that was absolutely no reason for me to take it out on you like I did. I said some things that were right foul. I-I was shocked by what you told me, but please don’t think I was judging you. I was mad at those arseholes because you don’t deserve to be treated like that.” He let the words rush out in a tumble as he felt that missing guilt suddenly rise in return. He’d been as bad as them, taking over her body so violently as if she was simply there for his use.“And then I went and got all—um, I was a complete prat and a loathsome pig. I shouldn’t have been so rough with you. Honestly, Luna, I’m terribly sorry. I hope—well, please tell me I didn’t hurt you?” By the time he’d finished, he had made his way across to her and was now reaching for her bare shoulders. He made sure to touch her gently as his fingers landed on her soft skin, all the while beseeching her to assuage his conscience.He’d been completely earnest in his appeal, but then Luna snorted loudly, dispelling the sober mood.“Harry, you could never hurt me, you’re my friend. I trust you completely. You just had some things you needed to get out of your system. Daddy says that you have to let your demons out every now and again if you ever hope to slay them,” she finished sagely.“He says that, does he? And has your father slain a lot of demons?” The boy added with some chagrin. Considering the stories her father published, and considering how his daughter adored him, Harry imagined the man as a doting, loving figure; harmless and eccentric, maybe, but certainly not one potentially dangerous the way he’d felt recently.“Some. He’s had his fair share,” she offered, but then left it at that. Harry seemed surprised, but then remembered that the man had suffered the loss of his wife.“But you’re okay?”  Harry sought her assurance once more.“Yes, of course, Harry. I’m more than okay,” she purred in such an uncharacteristically sexy voice, that Harry visibly jolted. He looked at her again in amazement. Was…was Luna flirting with him?  The very idea of it was making his head swim.“Would you like to feel even better?” he suggested huskily. Merlin, he did NOT just say that! However, there was no missing her distinct ‘come hither’ expression at his offer.Yet, while his inner dialogue groaned, Harry became attuned to his heavy breathing and his tongue’s sudden insistence to be buried deep down Luna’s throat. Before his mind could register what he was doing, his body had her up against the wall and was kissing that luscious mouth. He wanted to eat that Cheshire smile of hers, it was driving him mad. He could hear himself grunt as he pushed her form flat against the stone with his own, his arms gripping those small wrists and pinning them up over her head. His hips were already snapping in motion, winding into her pelvis with desperation; that frenzied flapping in his gut driving him up to a dizzying arousal once more. Stop! You can’t go off on her like that again, his mind tried to caution, and with some difficulty the boy peeled his body back away from hers. He inspected her face for signs of distress, but only saw his surging desire mirrored there. Good Lord, she looked infinitely fuckable like that.Without even checking behind him, Harry backed up to a bench with his grip still fast around her wrists. When the wood hit the backs of his knees, he sat down with a thump then proceeded to slide his hands up under her skirts as he pulled apart her thighs to straddle him. She scooted into his lap as her legs adjusted around him, the shins folded flat on the bench while her feet rested against his knees. The teen was officially randy now and he pushed out all other voices in his head while he concentrated on her form.Harry felt greedy all of a sudden. He wanted to put his hands everywhere on her at once, but he only had two of them and one mouth. Best to spread them out, he decided. First off, let’s get things out in the open, he thought practically, and pulled at the elasticated ruffle atop her blouse, his fingers like pincers as he dragged it down. Hu-llo, what’s this, then, randy voice marveled, as Luna’s bare breasts were revealed in the dim, flickering glow of the lamps, no dainty bra in his way. Even as he had adored those peaked globes of soft glory last night with his hands and mouth, Harry didn’t think he had fully appreciated just how perfectly shaped they were until seeing them like this on display. Although he had nothing much to compare them to, the young wizard didn’t need the visual cues in order to recognize what an exemplary pair he was about to take hold of. He encircled them with nimble fingers, kneading gently while gauging the pleasure of their heft and silky texture against his palms. Luna coaxed him on with a pliant moan.Right.He stopped to pull her arms free of their sleeves, pushing the blouse all the way down till it tucked around her waist. She looked good like that, he noted, like a water nymph surrounded by petals. He pulled her head down to him by long swatches of her hair so that he might occupy that mouth again as his left hand pinched and played with her nipple. Her breathy ahhs’in between his lips were like biscuits offered to an obedient dog. He snatched them up even as his addled brain seized on the idea of obedience and how much he liked that word in conjunction with Luna and what he wanted to do to the girl. His hands moved to a new breast and another place of refuge. While one kept busy inflicting more punishment to her right tit, the sneaky left traveled down to the hem of her skirts and tucked underneath, groping for that nexus of nectar, that rosy crucifixion. When he finally reached that core under layers of petticoat, his hand stroked skin and nothing else.“You have got to be kidding me,” he groaned into her lips.But there it was. It was one thing to be pantyless under pyjamas in the dead of night, but this had been going on all day surrounded by daylight and people. This girl had floated over to him with every intention of meeting him in secret. She was plum naked under her clothes and Harry knew, absolutely knew without a doubt that she’d done it for him. His emerald gaze burned intensely into hers while a fire licked his innards, and he conveyed his understanding of her gift through the darkest points of his pupils, the black pinpricks widening from his rapaciousness as though they’d been exposed to the night.Luna responded to his message by leaning her body back as her head tilted towards the ceiling, gyrating her cunt into his hand with a long whine. The pure wantonness affected Harry like nothing he’d ever encountered. His whole frame lit up as he lost the last of his reserve. He only hoped he could get out of his pants in time.He gripped her behind her back and twisted around in one go, feverishly throwing her down to the worktable in a heap as all concern for tenderness flew from his tenuous hold onto reason. One hand held her delicate wrist against the grain while the other fumbled hard to get the buttons open down the strip of denim in his cousin’s hand-me-down jeans. It was a tricky endeavor, but as soon as he could get free he was herding the material to his knees in a savage haste. Meanwhile, he growled his demands to his partner-in-lust.“Luna, lift up your skirt and spread open your legs. Oh fuck, do it now.” His need flecked his throaty issues in a keening rise. Luna quickly followed his heed like a horse with a bit being directed by reins. Harry wasted no time guiding his prick inside her moist slit, but stilled himself on top of her a moment to let his heart rate slow down. His face burrowed into her neck as he breathed hard puffs of air, the thumping in his chest echoing in space. When he was able to get himself back under control, he slid the subdued girl’s remaining arm above her head as well and then leaned his own across them both, grinding them into the table as he pushed his hips up to start moving inside her. He looked back into her eyes again as he fucked her slowly, the gushy sounds from their joining that crept into his ears providing a soundtrack to their sex.It felt as good as last night, but it was different. Different in a good way, though, in that he felt in charge of his emotions, in that he could sense a reciprocal flow between them like two magnets drawn to mate. There was an implicit surrender in the way Luna opened herself to him, as much as in a spiritual sense as the physical. In that moment, Harry thought he could ask anything of this glowing girl, his special friend, and she would grant it unequivocally. This unspoken agreement wrapped Harry in swaddle, safe and protected as a babe in the womb. So he urged his thrusts deeper as he gained momentum, that unreachable, unnamable spot in her body calling to him like sirens at sea. Her moans only heightened his yearning and he started to speed up his pounding into her core. He felt as if he was coming undone.“Ohgodohgodohhhhhhhhhhhh……Bloody….fuuuuck.” The girl’s body shuddered against him as her cunt closed tight around his cock and he came hard in a series of shocks to his balls as they emptied their seed. It felt like his body was cumming for a long time, and he lost touch with the planes of reality for a moment as the tension spewed out with his spunk. The two teens lay heavy and panting in the aftermath, Luna’s suddenly free limbs creeping around him in a hug.“I’m glad you wanted to talk to me, Harry,” she said in an exhale. He looked at her with hopeless affection. He was going to have a hard time parting with this, with her, after tomorrow. It was like his stress had evaporated. He wished he had known before what a calming influence sex had on the body. Although he sincerely doubted he would have been able to get Ginny to consent.Oh.  Bugger that..Ginny was waiting up in the Common room for him. He broke away from Luna’s embrace as he started to worry over the time. Just how long had they been in here? He moved his focus to getting out of there quickly. His friends might start to worry. Or get suspicious.“Er, Luna, we’d better get going. I wasn’t supposed to…uh, never mind. Let’s get that cloak before you need to use it again,” he warned.Luna sat up and put her clothes back to rights, their wrinkled folds giving her a sloppy air. Her hair was a mess. Merlin, he must look a fright, too, and he reached up to slick his wild tufts back so he might appear somewhat decent again. He ran his palms down his shirt in a straightening motion. A small, glittering suggestion of a square was handed to him like a kerchief and he took hold of it to tuck in his back pocket alongside his wand. Then he froze. Those swinging earrings that he hadn’t been able to describe earlier were now clearly in his sight. They were miniature gold snitches. He gaped at her again slightly confounded. How was she doing this to him? What the bloody hell was he doing with her? And could he even continue this? The questions whirred around his head like canaries as he mentally attempted to bat them away.“Uh, right, thanks. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow at the funeral?” Luna nodded her assent absentmindedly as she pulled a black hair from her front. He tried to get together the right words to approach his next question delicately.“Luna, this is…well, you understand this is just between us, right?” he asked guardedly.“Well, of course it is, there isn’t anyone else here,” she pointed out.Harry blushed.  Shit, let’s try this again.  “No, I mean, after we leave this room, we’ll keep it to ourselves, er, what’s been happening with us.”She stared at him plainly. “If that’s what you wish, Harry, I won’t say anything to anyone about the fact that we keep having sex.” The teen wasn’t sure how to interpret that, but he ran with it.“That’s what I wish, Luna. This is ours. No one else has to know. You understand me, right?” A forceful tone had surged in his words. He added a bit more softly, “I don’t quite think our friends would understand, least of all, Ginny. Okay?”“Yes, Harry.”“Good.” He sighed as he unlocked the door and shepherded them out into the quiet hallway. Now, if he could just get through tomorrow.   

     

“No, no, no, of course not! I haven’t even been sitting down with them since I’ve been back, but taking food up to my room, so we’ll be okay. Dudley’s off his diet this year, so there’s actually some decent food in the house and they don’t really ration it out to me anymore. I’ll bring you up whatever you want. Please don’t be angry. I know it’s not on, but I wouldn’t be able to see you otherwise. You have to believe me.” The young man finished his impassioned plea by leaning forward and grabbing her by the shoulders.   “I believe you, Harry.” Her eyes grew bigger at his petition. She always believed Harry; it never occurred to her to do otherwise.   “It’s just that…I didn’t know if…when, I’d be able to see you again. Once I get to the Burrow, the wedding is only a few days from that, and then….” He left the partial explanation hanging, hesitant to proceed, and something slid into formation in Luna’s brain.   “You’re going to find You-Know-Who,” she stated, recalling Ginny’s words on the train. “You’re not coming back to Hogwarts, are you?” Her expression was placid and smooth, but inside there was a sudden schism in her chest and it hurt to breath.  Harry stared at her gravely.  “Luna,” he whispered, “I don’t know if I’m coming back ever.”   Luna lifted a shaky hand up to brush the hair from his face. “You will, I know it,” she insisted quietly into the room, the enormity of what Harry was going to undertake threatening to crush them both. He ensnared her wrist with his middle finger and thumb then turned to bend his head to press his lips to the pulse underneath them. Luna focused her mind to the point, hearing it grow louder as the kiss lingered.    When he brought his head back up, he didn’t look at her, but cast his eyes over her body again. He backed up on his knees then grabbed her ankles and pulled hard, jerking her bum out from under her and landing her flat across the bed. He dropped his body on top of hers, molding each of his limbs to her own and pressing his weight down on her. His fingers gripped her wrists again and pulled them up over her head. She could feel his heaviness squash the oxygen in her lungs out, but concentrated on the feel of his balls resting at the mouth of her sex, his tumescence poking up towards her belly.   “Let’s not talk about that now,” he growled as his breath breezed over her face.     He looked down at her chest then scooted his body so that his mouth hung over her nipple, his hands sliding in the action to hold tight the white undersides of her forearms. His puffs of air over the hardened peaks caused Luna to squirm, but he pushed against her to stop her from moving before swirling his tongue around the tight nib. He coaxed it until Luna could feel an intense pressure building underneath the pleasure, his warm mouth pulling away every so often so that the air chilled her wet flesh, but then descending in a suck until teeth grazed around the nipple in a slow bite.   Harry bit down in a tightening grip and then just held it for several minutes, the pain sliding through Luna as she tried to move out from underneath him. Her mouth opened to protest, the moans rolling forth in a tumble, but Harry let go of his death grip only to move his teeth to the rest of her breast. Now he let some of his neediness inject into his attentions as he furiously bit and suckled at her tender flesh, letting the growls swell as he tore at her.     “Harry!” she cried, starting to worry at his wildness.  He looked at her with a dark gleam in his eyes, but he spoke almost tenderly. “Your skin is like fucking milk,” he cooed, staring down at the blood red marks like bright neon light against her porcelain hues. “I love how my teeth marks stand out so much.” He stared at her as if daring her to complain. Luna stayed quiet, though, transfixed by his green gaze as her cunt throbbed in the background of her thoughts.   Harry moved again, though this time when he pulled his body up, he sat on her pubis, his full weight settling down on her as his arse nestled in the v of her thighs. He let the bottoms of his legs rest to either side of her as he played with her breasts some more. He watched her responses carefully.   “Luna, bring your arms down,” she started to move them and he pulled them where he wanted, “now slide the back of your hands under your neck, like that.” He arranged them so that she was clasping them, palms up under the nape, then the boy pressed down on her elbows so that her breasts jutted upwards. He made her stay like that.    “I love your tits. They’re absolutely charming, did you know that?” he asked her rhetorically before he went on to expound. “They’re not too small, not too big, they’re just fucking right. So perfectly shaped and the swell of them is glorious.”     He continued to praise them even as he went about pinching and tugging at them. He twisted her right nipple hard until Luna arched up her body with a groan. “Was that too hard, then?” he asked roguishly, but then did the same thing to the left. Luna started to wonder how she was expected to react. Did he want her to moan and thrash about? Or was he testing her to see how much she could handle? She didn’t think she could win in a battle of wills with the fiery teen and she wasn’t much for exaggeration. She deduced that if Harry was just being his natural self, then she should act accordingly. Luna would do whatever she felt in the moment; and in this one she felt the need to absorb all of his pain. It was not lost on the pensive girl that Harry’s whole attitude had changed at the mere mention of Voldemort and the mission he’d set for himself.   Harry made to lay down on her again, although holding himself up with his hands this time as he hovered above her sternum again. This time he abused the opposite breast with his teeth so that the pair might bear his matching tattoos of carnality. He was purposely rough and savage with her, and the girl could not contain her fight against the onslaught, but her hands remained in place behind her neck as if tied there. Her moans were long.   When he sat up again to follow his noshing with some more punishment from his fingers, his expression was even more spirited and intent; ferocious in his delight, and out of nowhere he smacked his fingers flat against her nipple. The sound of the slap shocked them both still for a moment. Luna had her mouth open and breathing hard in needy whines. Harry stared at her hard and then did it again. The girl arched her back into the pain once more, letting another cry fly from her lips. Harry grew downright wolfish as he leaned over her.   “Oh, yeah, you liked that, didn’t you? Want some more, don’t you, little girl. Answer me,” Harry demanded of her. Luna scrunched up her eyes and let out a breathy “yes”, but that wasn’t enough for him.   “Tell me that you want me to do it again, Luuuuna,” he hissed.  The girl responded right away.   “Do it again, Harry.  Please.”   “Tell me that you want me to fuck you. You want me to split you open with my hard cock,” his voice rasped close to her ear now. She hesitated, but he pulled back his hand and smacked her harder on her other breast.   “Aaaahh!  Yes, Harry, fuck me.  Fuck me!” she shouted, but Harry was dogmatic.   “Say the rest of it.” Luna felt dizzy and flushed at Harry’s control of her now. But she struggled to give him what he wanted to hear.   “Please, split, ahh, split me—split me open with your cock. Your hard cock, Harry. I want you,” she added, fully in the flow of their exchange now as her pussy insisted on pleasing his command. Her hands started to unclasp as she made to reach for him, but Harry pushed them back.   “Leave your hands where I told you,” he issued, his voice gruff with an arrogance that would brook no argument. He pulled her legs up into the air roughly, his grip around her ankles as punishing as the force he usually reserved for her wrists. Then he opened them so they were resting against each shoulder and tugged her bottom forward as he pressed his rock hard shaft to her re-doused opening.   “I’m going to give you what you need now, Lu. I’ll fuck you so deep my prick will be in your throat, do you understand?” his voice was clear and domineering, but his eyes looked crazed and sparked with emerald fire.   Luna could only nod in a daze as she felt the slight roll of tears trickle down the sides of her temple. Harry’s hand trailed down her belly until it sat upon her pubic bone and dipped down to pinch her pulsing nub. Luna gave another breathy moan. Then Harry’s knob was piercing her wet gash once again.   For a while, the only sounds to be heard were the teens’ labored breathing, their raspy moans twirling in the sunlit stagnant air of the room. Soon, however, Harry was pushing her legs backwards towards her head and the girl let out another whine as he attempted to bend her in half with a fair amount of success. He now had his hands pressed to the backs of her shins and he was veritably bouncing into her cunt, his feet up on the points of his toes as he bobbed and wound his way into her passage.   “Ohhhh, yesssss, fuck yes, dear God and Merlin and fucking all, I need MORE.”    Luna could hear his shouts, but her head was caught up in the pain twinned with her pleasure as he scandalized her cunt with his persistence, deepening his thrusts until she thought he might slam into her heart. Small bursts of light kept popping in her peripheral vision and then Harry was right on top of her as he pressed her legs down against her in a final assault, his sharp hip bones cutting into her haunches. Soon Luna felt her walls ripple around him and moaned into the release while Harry shouted to another deity and filled her with his hot seed in his slowing pumps against her swollen folds.   The two young lovers each let out a great whoosh of breath as they came to the end. Harry rolled off of her with a slump, but then swiftly covered his face with his hands. Luna gingerly lay her legs back to the bed, but she turned to the boy with concern. Harry groaned through his fingers.   “Holy shite. What the fuck..? I don’t know what the devil is wrong with me, Luna!” he despaired. Luna took his wrist and tried to pull it away from his face. She tugged, but he wouldn’t let himself be seen.   “Harry, please, look at me,” she begged. She wouldn’t relent in her tugging until he finally complied. He turned to her with a face lit in shame and he rolled his eyes upward so he wouldn’t have to look into hers. He gave another shaky exhale and his eyes turned glassy.   “Jesus, I am seriously fucked up,” he wailed into the walls of the room.   “Harry, what is it?  What’s the matter?  It was okay, I’m alright.”  She tried to comfort him with her assurances.   When he finally turned to her, he looked into her confused face with a sheepish lopsided smile. His hand tucked a stray hair behind her ear before he opened his mouth, spending a few seconds trying to let his thoughts come out in the open.   “I’m so sorry, Luna. I feel terrible when I just mow you down like that. I don’t know why I can’t just be…you know, normal about it.” His gaze was beseeching, actively hunting for some glimmer of damnation in her eyes. Or maybe he was looking for approval, she thought.   “I like the way you are with me, Harry,” she told him in a measured tone. He seemed to catch some hope in her expression.   “Really?  It’s alright, then?” he asked, appearing completely surprised by her concession.  Luna tried to think about the ramifications of his actions and how it affected her. She wanted to be truthful to Harry; she felt he deserved it.   “Um, it’s very intense. You never come to anything half-hearted, Harry, which I enjoy watching. I feel like you’re pushing me to something, making me see a truth about myself that I didn’t know was there. It’s sort of like when you taught us in the DA. You’re fair and you’re encouraging in your tone, but you have a demanding way about you that I find very exciting to be around.”   Harry stared at her a bit warily before he snickered at the image she painted. “The DA? Right. Of course, I remember now insisting Neville take my hard cock before he could learn a proper Expelliarmus, how silly of me to forget,” the boy joked.   Luna curled into his arm and snuggled against his torso. She let her fingers slide over his toned chest, relishing the feel of its hardness under her palm.   “I feel very safe with you, Harry Potter. I know you wish me no harm. I want you to feel safe with me, too.” She tilted her head to look up at him and gauge how her words soothed him. He appeared somewhat humbled.   “You’re really something, you know that?” he whispered.   Luna pondered some more over his inclinations. “Perhaps the Knashers are affecting you. Have you checked lately for any rashes around your penis?” she thought it might be part of the problem, but could recall no spots of evidence around his bits. She moved to check him out before Harry stopped her.   “Er, what are the Knashers, pray tell?” he asked guardedly.  Luna gave him one of her patented Luna stares.   “Well, they’re small creatures that feed off your most primal lust. They have very sharp teeth and tend to swarm around any area that produces the most desire. I think they may be attracted to the pheromones. Daddy says they often heighten one’s passion to the point of recklessness and warns that a steady diet of Gurdyroot and asphodel keep them at bay.”     Harry just stared with a hint of amusement in his eyes. “I see.” He waited a beat. “Luna, I’m not drinking any of that Gurdyroot crap. It’s vile.”   Luna gave a small smile in agreement.  “You get used to it,” she suggested.   Harry suddenly curled himself over her as he pushed her flat against the bed. “So, you don’t think I’m a disturbed nutter who needs to lock himself away, then?” She shook her head sagely.   “Would you mind if I tried some other things with you?” He approached the suggestion hesitantly, his eyes darting around her face to watch for the first sign of discomfort.   “I wouldn’t mind, at all.” Luna locked onto his eyes and imparted all the consent she could muster through her protuberant orbs.   Harry visibly gulped; she watched his throat bob. He appeared to be culling the remnants of his bravado as he attempted to give voice to his next wish. Finally, he just went for it.   “I would really, really, really like to tie you up, Luna,” he admitted with a grave insistence. He held his breath while he waited for her reply.   Luna merely looked at the boy with her blank stare.  “Why?”   “I have…no idea.” He appeared as perplexed by the information as she. “But it is a really fucking powerful bent,” the boy finished in awe. He flicked his eyes as if fearing he had given away too much.   “What would you do with me once you did that?” she asked, still showing no sign of anything other than a mild curiosity. Harry fixed his gaze at her and stopped fidgeting before he tonelessly rattled off his fantasy scene in quick outtakes, as if he had been thinking about the matter a long time and had prepared a speech.   “I want to tie your hands up to your feet behind your back, then pleasure you for hours until you’re insane with it and I can see your juices literally pouring out of your cunt, and then I want to have you suck me off while I bury most of my fingers in your sopping twat,” he stopped for a moment as he further puzzled the logistics of that one. “I haven’t quite figured that position out, but I will. I want to spank your beautiful lily white bottom until its flaming fire, and then I want to bounce you on my prick while you’re still hogtied until I’m swimming in a river of your cum.” He finished finally with a heavy heave and swallow of breath. Harry appeared to be ready for her disgust, but there remained a glimmer of innocent appeal in his eyes as he waited to hear her reaction.   Luna, for her part, ruminated over the details very thoughtfully as she wondered to where the impetus for the Chosen One’s fascinations lie. She considered him seriously before asking him about the one part that made her most nervous.   “Why spanking?  Is there something you like about giving pain?”   The boy tried to be as honest with her as he could, but seemed to have a hard time explaining his kink. “I don’t know, Luna. It’s—hard to say why, exactly. I think it has something to do with you, though. Something about the way we seem to…connect. It’s like,” and here, Harry paused as he tried to summon up the best answer, “like, I want to take care of you, but in a really bizarre, sexual way. Does that seem remotely logical?” he asked her openly with a hope that she might know.   Luna tried another angle to the discussion. “Have you ever been through intense pain, Harry? I mean, physically, your body under enormous strain as you felt besieged by it?” She was very intrigued to hear his answer. Harry replied instantly.   “Yes.” The patient girl waited for him to illustrate the scenario further. “Um, in the graveyard with Voldemort. He used the Cruciatus on me. It was the most painful thing I’ve ever felt; like hot blades flaying open my skin and slicing the nerve endings.” He continued in a manner as if talking about someone else.   “And the headaches are unbearable. When I get these flashes of his presence, he invades my consciousness with daggers in my brain. It’s absolutely excruciating. The slices in my hand from that bitch Umbridge were no picnic, either, come to think of it.” He regarded her with concern, however.   “Look, Luna, I would never go that far.  You do trust me, don’t you?”  His eyes opened wide affecting a childish innocence.   “How did you manage that?” she wanted to know. She was supremely shocked by his reveal on the Unforgivable, and Luna was a girl who did not shock easily. “And of course I trust you. I just want to clarify a few things, is all.”   Harry tried once again to be as candid with her as best he could. “I guess I just work through it. Pain isn’t anything to be afraid of, Luna,” said the boy who must have held an all-time record for visits to the infirmary. “I know it’s going to end, and I know it will only make me stronger when I beat it.”   While the dreamy girl was not quite surprised by his answer, she felt her admiration for him grow, regardless. He was someone she could learn a lot from, she acknowledged, and she felt a stirring at his fierce hunger and desire to do these things with her.  It made her feel warm and special.   “Okay, Harry,” she breathed out.  Harry’s dumbstruck expression at her acceptance quickly split into a bubbly grin.   “Yeah?” he asked enthusiastically, barely able to contain his excitement.   “Yes.”  The girl was suddenly scooped up into a massive hug, full of squeezing boy arms and legs.   “Omygodohmygod, ohmygod, Lu, thank you, thank you.” He looked back at her with a wild joy and then kissed her in a tight embrace, lavishing her mouth with his appreciation.   Luna felt giddy being next to this happy person that was rarely this expressive. Harry looked around to the floor all of a sudden, searching for something that didn’t appear to be there.   “Oh, shit.  Shite!,” he exclaimed.  He gave Luna a frightened stare as some dangerous thought flashed across his face.   “I left my knapsack downstairs in the kitchen. Fuck, I hope Dudley didn’t notice it,” he worried. Harry sprang around to look at the clock on his bedside. “Shit!”, he muttered again.   “Um, look, my aunt will be back from her garden club meeting pretty soon. I’m going to run downstairs, grab the cloak, and make us a quick spot of lunch, is that alright?” He looked her over again. “Damn, you must be starved. Um, did you need to use the loo while I’m down there before anyone is home?” he queried.   Luna nodded her head and then Harry jumped off the bed to pull on his jeans. He threw his shirt on over his glasses and went to grab her hand as they made their way to the door. After unlocking the bolt, he poked his head out of the door into the hallway. Luna stood behind him still nude.   “Okay, down this way.” He walked her to the strangely lit Muggle bathroom and quickly showed her how everything worked, although there weren’t too many differences. He ran away and she heard him clunking down the stairs much like his cousin’s group earlier. Luna marveled at the bathroom’s shiny interior. She thought it quite posh compared to the little space she had in her own house. There was a lot of glass about, she noted. Everything sparkled.   She moved slowly through the hall with an utter lack of concern over her nakedness and peeked into a few of the rooms before coming back to Harry’s. There was a lot of ticking throughout the house. She had observed the much grander scale of the other bedrooms with some bemusement and wondered again why they were threatened by their nephew.   Luna sat back on Harry’s bed and took in more of the details of the space, his sole haven away from Hogwart’s and the Burrow. She dawdled over the locks she had noticed on the outside of his bedroom door. She watched Hedwig rustle in his open cage. She reached over to pick up the framed moving photo of Harry’s mum and dad. She hoped that they could see wherever they were what a beautiful, strong, special boy they had given birth to. Luna set the picture back down as she heard Harry’s ascent on the stairs.   In another moment, he was walking back into their private lodging with a tray of food and glasses, his knapsack hung over one shoulder. He kicked the door shut behind him, then walked over to the bed to place the tray down. He smiled at her before turning back to bolt the door again. Luna looked over their repast on the tray and tickled at the sight of a red rose lying across the top of their plates. She picked it up by the stem carefully and inhaled deeply of its cloying scent.   “What’s this?” she asked Harry as he sat down across from her.  He blushed and looked at his knees, muttering a brief for you.  He attempted to save face by clearing his throat and making a grand show of their late lunch.     “Um, well, I don’t know how hungry you are, but I’m not feeling terribly peckish, so I brought up some light fare.” He started to open a small tin with a strange top that popped off and handed it to her with a spoon. She regarded the item most curiously.   “What is it?” she asked with her saucer eyes.   “Pudding,” was Harry’s reply. “I hope you like vanilla.” Luna looked down at the creamy substance inside and then looked up at Harry again. A beat later, she burst out into a tinkling laughter, clapping her hands in her glee. Harry’s slow grin moved across his face like a sunrise.   “I have some bread and butter and some apple slices, too. And I found some orange pop if you’d like that, but I brought water, too. I suspect we’ve used up a lot of sweat. Can’t have you getting dehydrated on me, can I?” Luna was touched by his caring attention to her body’s needs.   “I didn’t know how you would feel about lemon marmalade, so I just made it butter.  Hope that’s all right.”   “Oh, of course,” Luna enthused.  Then she added in a whimsical tone, “It was, after all, the BEST butter, you know.”   Harry looked at her strangely for a moment then tipped his head back and laughed loudly. When his eyes met hers again, he was in high spirits and amused by the notion that Luna knew more about Muggles than she let on.   “And I suppose YOU know why a raven is like a writing desk, eh?” he teased, as he comprehended the source of her quote.   “Silly boy, Carroll insisted there is no answer. He’s just poking fun at your need to have every question make some sort of rational sense.” Harry looked at her coyly and then gazed over her long locks.   “You know, the first few times I spoke with you, I envisioned you as a bit of an Alice,” he admitted. Luna lowered her eyelids in consternation.   “Really? But Alice strikes me as more of a Hermione type,” she reasoned. “You know, never truly accepting of the things she can’t explain all around her and insisting the inhabitants on the other side of the rabbit hole are all silly and wrong for tossing out the rules of her understanding.” Harry appeared surprised at her appraisal, but was willing to concede the point.   “I suppose I can see a bit of that. But you know, I take Hermione’s brilliance for granted, I don’t really question it too much. She’s saved my arse more times than I care to admit.” He thought some more about his friend. “Although, I can see what you mean about her unwillingness to accept certain things. We got into some right nasty tiffs this school year. I know I’ve made some bad calls before, but my gut is hard to fight. It’s kept me alive, more often than not. Her bossiness can be trying at times, but I’m no saint, either, am I?” He looked to Luna as if she would be best to provide the answer to that.   “Well, barring that willful streak of yours, I think you listen to a lot of what your friends counsel. It’s not as if you’re ever dismissive of them, right?” Harry cast his eyes downward with a pink tinge in his cheeks and coughed. “I sometimes think Hermione limits herself on purpose.”     “What do you mean?” Harry asked with a quizzical expression.     “Like, she’s afraid to see beyond a certain realm because she doesn’t know what she’ll do there. I suspect she’s had a hard enough time fitting into Wizarding society.” Luna ripped up her bread and noshed as she pondered the bright girl’s cleverness.   After a sip from his drink, Harry changed subjects.  “How do you know about Alice in Wonderland? I only read it because of regular school. I’m not one for books, normally, but I remember how much I enjoyed the world in that one. I guess I was about ten,” he recalled fondly.   “Daddy read it to me often as a little girl. It’s one of his favorite books. Although Daddy’s read everything so he has a lot of favorites. He’s a big enthusiast of Muggle literature, especially Shakespeare and Kafka. Mum was more into her Greeks.” It felt oddly comforting being able to share these things about her mother with Harry.   “Well, I suppose I see you as Alice mostly because of the long blond hair, and the, you know, um, creatures no one’s ever heard of.” He had enough sense to look somewhat abashed at that. He peered closer to her, though, and let his hair flop into his eyes.   “Er, Luna, can I ask for a favor?”  Harry was definitely skittish now and picked at his pants and jostled their tray.   “Of course you can, Harry.”   He looked up at her and gulped.  “Will you let me brush your hair?”   The girl immediately put her hand to her crown and covered it. She knew it was always a mess, but she just didn’t feel up to dealing with it. It dawned on her that Harry might not like that about her; it wasn’t very pretty, bit ratty, actually.   “Oh, sorry. I know it’s not very becoming this way. My mother was always the one who would spend every morning getting it straight. I suppose I sort of lost interest in tending to it. Is it that bad?” she grimaced.   “What? No!, No, no, absolutely not,” he denied. He looked alarmed that he might have insulted her. “I love your hair, really. It just needs to get some knots out and bring back a bit of gleam.” He tried another tactic. “I mean, it’s my fault it needs brushing right now, isn’t it, the way I’ve been tossing you all over my bed.”   Luna brought her palm down from her head and let it curl around her throat. Harry immediately let his half-lidded gaze drop to her neck with something dark clouding his eyes. Luna relented.   “It’s alright, I suppose. But I will warn you it’s a nasty tangle. There’s so much of it. I don’t know what to do with it,” the girl complained self-consciously.   “Oh, I can think of a few things I’d like to try,” murmured Harry in a low rumble. He was getting his pouncey look on his face again.   There was a door slam downstairs. Harry tuned into the loud entrance and listened for the reveal of the person’s identity. He held his hand up to her to signal silence. The teens heard much traversing of footsteps back and forth on the lower floor. The boy turned to her then and mouthed the words, Aunt Petunia, before slowly and as quietly as possible he slipped off the bed and went to retrieve the cloak out of his bag. He grabbed it, Luna’s bag, and then a hairbrush from the top of his dresser, and stole back to the bed with barely a creak from the carpet.     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Several hours later and Harry was still fussing with Luna’s hair as they sat above the din of the dining room, catching snatches of conversation from his uncle’s bellowing bray over everything infernal in his daily workload. The two of them giggled as Harry rolled his eyes over the inane chatter around the dining room table. “I told you,” he whispered in her ear, as he brushed another sleek strand down her back. It had taken him a long time to separate the tufts of clotting hair, but he’d pulled her colorful barrettes out and committed to it completely. Luna felt touched by his attentiveness once more. Plus, it felt positively luxurious to have this strong boy sliding the bristles back along her scalp, breathing over her and murmuring sweet declarations into the mane.   The boy had stopped sometime in the middle of his styling to make an appearance downstairs. When he came up, he had brought them some slivers from the roast chicken and the two slopped up the succulent chunks with gusto. Then Harry had licked the smeared juices from around her mouth. He would stop every so often in his duty to her now somewhat sleek tresses and run his hands lovingly over her breasts and belly, letting his fingers slide down to her core. He would pull her hair to the side and kiss her shoulder, up and down her neck, lick the nape and inhale. He would trail light fingertips down her spine until she arched her back.   After a while of this, neither one could control their ardor. Harry started to pull up on her thighs so he could sit her on his lap and bite at the flesh on her arms. Luna, in her tremulous need for him, tried to turn into his embrace and grab at his prick, her mouth already absorbing his tongue. The sounds from the domesticity downstairs only served to heighten their desires as the delicious secretive nature of their demands for each other grew in its silent intensity.   Harry was breathing quite heavy now, and had not bothered to turn on his light yet, the dusk of the evening settling shadows around the room. He pulled her ear close to his mouth again and requested of her in a heavy timbre if she would do what he asked right now without question. Luna let out a soft, pliant, but affirmative moan.   Suddenly, he was off the bed and pulling out a dresser drawer. He really was very stealthy, she admired. He clicked on the small lamp by his bed and a soft glow filled the room. Harry had pulled a handful of his school ties from his stash. He slipped them on the bed before moving over to his desk. Luna turned to him, trying to ascertain his plans by whatever he was doing in the corner. It appeared he was emptying the flat space of its contents, hurriedly but silently moving them to the floor. He came back to the bed and grabbed her hand, leading her over to the small writing table.   “Let me know if this gets too uncomfortable, okay? I just want to see if it’ll work.” Luna only stared at him and let the boy move her about at will. He set her bum on the top of the desk and then reached behind her to lift up the window. The coolness of the late night breezed in on a flurry of rustling leaves. Luna shivered.   She could just make out Harry’s face with his back to the light like this. He was showing a bit of apprehension mixed with a persevering resolution. He gulped at her before reaching for the ties in one grip.     “This is just an experiment,” he whispered to her, his warm breath mingling with the chilled, sweet odors of night grass. Harry pulled one of his ties around her mouth, until it was between her teeth and against her tongue. He knotted it behind her head, mindful to keep it from twining in her hair. He looked at her in appeal, summoning a nod or a shake as to the acceptance of the proposed activity. Luna was starting to get a clue and she put her hands out to him to do with what he wanted. Harry pulled his desk out just a little, the creak absorbed into the carpeted floor.    He then pushed her backwards until she was laying across the desk by the width. Her head leaned onto the window sill, and Harry disappeared from view as he bent low under the small table and pulled her wrist to a leg. Luna could feel one of the ties bind her in a fairly tight knot. He then slipped over to the other side of her and did the same to the other hand. Having the twilight air ghost over her breasts as they stood pert and willing, feeling her arms stretched their full length on either side of her; the girl let the sensations build across her flesh in a tingling ferocity.     She was now aware of Harry pulling her legs open to accommodate the front spindly poles of the desk with more ties. Her back smarted a bit, but she ignored it, so caught up was she in the stimuli of her immediate environment: Harry’s hands working diligently but carefully; the gusts of fragrance billowing over her; the tightness of the cordlike material rough against her mouth. She finally sensed him standing before her, even though her eyes were closed, and he moaned at the sight of her. He shifted her arse forward on the desk until it hung over the edge, and then as he wrapped his hands to her thighs, let his comforting stiffness penetrate her once again.    There was a loud, beefy laugh downstairs as the Dursleys’ activities now wafted from the sitting room. Harry looked over her tenderly as he slowly slid in and out of her, avoiding the wincing of the desk under its duress by his careful movements. She could hear his slight moans as he took her, trying to keep their lovemaking volume to a minimum. The sound of it traveled out the window on the tufts of wind. His fingers scaled her peaks and stroked delicately, he ran them all over her hips and her sides, making her ticklish in the light touch. He rubbed her exposed cunt, sucking on his fingers and coating them with spit before sliding them over that electric nub of flesh in a faster motion than he allowed himself. Luna felt her body jerk upwards even with the restraints as he pinched her clit again. Her body felt on fire and the cool air did nothing to slake her fevered thirst.    Before too long, Harry was getting restless in his cautious pumping. He put his head down to rest on her chest for a moment before dragging his face close to hers.   “I need to move you, okay?” he whispered.  She nodded her gagged assent.   Harry pulled himself out of her, and Luna could see the early rise of the moon glisten across the dewy coat of his prick. It was a vision to behold, she decided. He bent out of sight again, and she could feel the tugging on her appendages as he tore at the knots to break her free. Once he was done, he meticulously rolled her upwards, and the girl could feel the cricks in her protesting back, but Harry wrapped her legs around him and picked her up, his hands cupping her bottom.   After moving at first to the bed, only to hear it groan a little too loudly for his liking, Harry settled on moving them to the floor. He raised himself up on his knees and turned her around, no longer speaking but confidently taking hold of her like a doll being propped for a tea party. The colorful Gryffindor ties were still wrapped to her wrists, and now Harry brought them up to her neck, working behind her to take the wide strand of one and tie the material around her neck, then tying the ends to each other, so that she was affixed by the two with her hands at her throat, but leaving enough slack for her to not feel choked. He moaned in her ear brazenly in light of their furtive activity.   “You’re absolutely glowing.  You’re a fucking Goddess, Luna.”     She could only respond to him by her own low whine against the gag. Then he split her apart over his lap again, hefting her up enough to spit her with his cock. She let a rather heavy groan escape her as she felt herself be speared, but soon Harry was holding on to her waist with white knuckles as he bounced her up and down in a fast jog of fucking. He was moving her with such speed and Luna could only make out a blur in front of her, her senses akimbo and her reason long ago left behind. Soon Harry’s rasping breath ached with need and his hands traveled under her armpits and over her shoulders as he bent her forward, pulling her back on his pounding prick with such force Luna felt cracks in her shell.   Her muffled scream came in a long burst as she felt her orgasm eclipse her and then Harry was pushing her front down on the ground and he slowed his thrusts, going as he deep as he could with a winding viciousness as he fucked her into the very tasteful, beige carpeted floor of the Dursley household. Harry grunted into her ear and then bit her neck as he let the shockwaves run through them as his cum flowed, stilling finally after they ran their course. The young lovers lay that way for a few moments, their harsh gusts from the exertion blowing against each other as they tried to catch their breaths.   At long last, Harry pulled himself off of Luna and then set upon the ties still waiting to be unknotted. Luna moved groggily once she was free, but Harry rolled her over on her back and kissed her deeply for a long time. When the girl could find no more breath left in her lungs, no more energy to meet his unending passion, he curled her up in his arms and then brought her to his small, perfunctory bed. The two teens lay curved against each other and fell asleep almost immediately as the television cackles of tinned laughter rose up from the depths of the house.   

She gave him another warm smile.  “I know.”   “So…you want it, then? Let’s make this absolutely clear. You like what I do to you? For real?,” and he raised his eyebrows as if he still unbelieving of his good fortune.   “Yes, Harry.”   “Why?”Luna thought about it some more. “It’s like….like I’m very small, I’m just this tiny little thing, like a hummingbird or a Pygmy Puff, and you scoop me up into both of your hands, letting me sit in the hollow of your palms and you bring me up close to your face and whisper to me,” and by now she was acting out the metaphor, “everything’s going to be alright, Luna,” she hushed into her cupped hands.  Harry swallowed deeply as he stared at her mesmerized.    “You tie me up and I feel protected by you, like nothing could ever hurt me again. And by that, I don’t mean like a physical injury, because you’re right, I should stop being afraid of that. I don’t mind if you teach me, Harry. You’re a very good teacher. But,” and here she picked up her thread of thought, “I mean, no one can hurt me inside, anymore.” She cocked her head to the side and sighed deeply.    “Oh, Harry, I know it’s not very realistic, maybe we’re just in a fantasy, but reality has never been of much comfort to me.”  He felt visibly affected by her words, and his voice sounded rough as he spoke. “I can appreciate that. Reality has pretty much kicked me in the teeth since I was a baby. I should be used to it by now,” he frowned at that, “maybe I AM used to it, too much so, and I just want to get away from it for a while. I just want…control of my life,” he shrugged. “Is that why I like to control your body?”  She stared right into him and he saw her hunger there, hunger for him.  “You own it, don’t you?”    Harry flushed at the reminder of his demonstration on the train. “Oh, well, um,” he stumbled, “I was a bit, um, nutters. I don’t know why I said those things to you. I suppose I was trying to make a point. I wasn’t really, you know...” He couldn’t finish, as he realized he didn’t really understand what the hell he’d meant when he said that. He had been pretending, right? For Luna’s own good. Did she want him to keep up the charade? Was she still keeping their agreement to offer herself completely to him? She’d certainly kept up her end of the bargain since then, he noted wryly.    “You didn’t really want me?” she asked him softly.   Harry’s eyes grew huge in his face. “What? Of course I want you. I want you all the time, are you joking?” He looked at her as if she were suddenly mad. “Apparently, I can’t get enough of you.” Luna gave him that seductive smile again and he had to stamp down his wildness. He considered her for a moment before asking the real question he wanted answered.   “Do you want me to own you?”   Instead of speaking, she merely folded her hand around his and then dragged it between her legs, slipping his fingers to her petals and fitting her cunt into the crook of his palm. He leaned over to kiss her and just held her like that for a good while, loving the feel of her handed over to him in such a gesture.   When he leaned back from her, he smiled in a daze, a laugh breaking free as he tried to piece together how they'd come to this place and why hadn’t it happened sooner. He wanted more time with her. He looked at his clock at the thought. Vernon would be getting home from work shortly; he didn’t know when his aunt would be arriving. Harry wondered when they might get word from Luna’s father. He needed her another night.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It was early evening by the time Luna and Harry were sitting on the floor chowing down on hot, greasy pepperoni pizza. It was quite a treat for the both of them. Harry rarely got it and Luna had never tried it, and he was still amused at how he’d gotten the slices smuggled up to his room.   Soon after Vernon had arrived home, Dudley had come knocking on his door. The rest of his friends had gone home for a bit to get changed for their night out, but Piers was still hanging about with his bezzy mate and both boys had been downstairs watching telly. After Harry had covered up Luna, he’d slipped up to the door and opened it a slight crack. Dudley was waiting to tell him his mum would be back much later and dad was springing for pizzas for dinner. As his cousin asked him for their preference of topping, Harry marveled further at the odd change of attitude. Who was this person? Dudley was being quite gracious at this point. Later on, once the delivery had made its way to Privet Drive, it was the large teen that had snuck up the slices for the couple. Harry was almost touched.    Luna had gotten dressed again and the two were goofing about as they enjoyed their meal. Harry would smear grease across her cheek and then lick it off, while Luna would hold a pepperoni slice up in the air over his nose and dangle it like bait for a seal. He would make the appropriate leap to snap it up. It was during these shenanigans that Hedwig flew up to the window waiting to be let inside. Harry offered the owl some pepperoni for his troubles and Luna tore open her letter, already expecting a reprieve for her departure. She wouldn’t read aloud what her father wrote, but told Harry he had her until tomorrow afternoon, when her father would need her by 3 o’clock. This was very, very good news for the randy boy, he could do a lot to her in that time.   But even as his puerile thoughts drifted over scenes of sexual deviance that he’d like to visit upon her, his mind felt troubled. He kept looping back to her quaking state after the boys caught them in flagrante delicto. There was something wrong there, he could feel it, but he was loath to bring it up. He thought about their conversation earlier, before the 69 they’d attempted, and how Luna had compartmentalized the acts with her molesters at school.    Her words came back to him from her explanation of the safeguarding Harry provided her, how there was a hint of tragedy intertwined with her revelations. None of it sat well with him, but he didn’t know if he could handle hearing her story, didn’t know if he could ruin their time together when the clock was ticking. Yet, he somehow felt he owed it to her, anyway.   “Luna, I need to talk to you about something,” he started hesitantly. The girl merely waited for him to begin. Harry thought of a way in.   “When you get back to Hogwarts, I’m not going to be there. I won’t be able to protect you. You remember what I told you before, about how I wouldn’t let anyone mess with what’s mine, and I mean it. I just want you to understand that you can’t let them win, that we have to find a way to make sure you’re safe from The Twits or those Ravenclaw pricks who think they can use you whenever they want.” He was forceful enough, he thought, that she listened to him, yet quietly maintaining that he cared for her and only had her welfare in mind. “I can’t have that happen again, Luna, I won’t stand for it. Just the thought of any of them touching you makes me bleeding insane.”  But then he pulled back a little from his intensity. “Mind you, I’m already a little mad, as it is, so we really need to be careful about this stuff. You wouldn’t want to push me over the edge, would you?”   Luna looked at him curiously then smiled. She shook her head ‘no’ emphatically. Harry pointed at himself and whispered, as if warning her.   “Bit touched in the head, I am.  You can ask anyone.”   “You’re as sane as I am, Harry Potter," Luna grinned.   “Oh, well then, we make a perfect pair, don’t we?” He suddenly realized what he was implying with such a remark and watched her response carefully. Luna’s eyes were shining.   “I’ll do whatever you want of me, Harry,” the girl confirmed. He had an idea bloom in his head just then.   “Perhaps I can show you some more defensive moves when we’re both back in Devon, before I leave,” he suggested. “I can sneak over to see you while we’re waiting for Bill and Fleur’s wedding to happen. You’re pretty close to the Burrow, aren’t you?”   “Yes, not far at all.”  Luna’s smile grew broader.   “Good. So, it’s settled then.” That persistent feeling of dread still sat in his stomach like acid, however, and he proceeded with his questioning very carefully.   “Luna,” he gulped, “you recall when I asked you that first night we…we were together, I asked you if you, well, if you were a virgin.” He watched her start to grow uneasy, her eyes cast down and she fidgeted with her hands around her feet.   “Yes, I remember.”   “You said it wasn’t Malfoy or any of his band. I believe you, I do, but I just have to know…” Harry licked his lips, his mouth very dry as he spoke, “was your first time…was it a pleasant experience?”   The girl continued to play with her toes and kept her gaze affixed to the floor. After a while, she peered up at him through a flop of hair and moved her head slowly from side to side.   Now Harry was having a hard time drawing air into his lungs, but he fixed his stare to hers and forced himself to ask the next question.   “Was it consensual?”   Luna let her long silvery lashes fall forward, her movements coming to a finish as she held herself very still. Harry was aware of every little sound in the room as he waited for her answer.   “If I tell you, you might not like me anymore,” she said.  He was shocked out of his stance for a moment, at that, but adamantly refuted the notion.   “No way, Luna, that won’t ever happen. Nothing you could tell me would change how I feel about you.” Once again he was struck by how his words left an implicit suggestion of something deeper in their relationship, how he might have a stronger kinship with the girl than perhaps even he realized.   Luna sighed, her eyes back on her feet.   “Did you know that my father has only had The Quibbler for the last five years?” Harry looked at confused at the non sequitur, but shook his head. Apparently, Luna was going to tell this story her way.   And then she began to talk.   “Before he started it, he used to work for the Ministry. He and mum, both. They were Unspeakables for the Department of Mysteries. That’s all they ever told me, I wasn’t allowed to know what they were working on. My dad had been there for many years before my mum showed up; he was regarded very highly and quite esteemed for his brilliance. He’s advanced a lot of new spellwork in his career.” The boy couldn’t help but feel surprise at this.   “They were several decades apart in age. Dad’s still in his prime, but he’s no spry Graphorn anymore. But he was well established when my mum got out of school. She came to the Ministry as his assistant. She said she fell in love with him at first sight. She thought he was the most extraordinary person she’d ever met. It took a while for Daddy to admit to himself how he felt about her, though. He told me he felt like a schoolboy when faced with her beauty. Daddy! Feeling like that? He’d already accomplished so much by then.” Luna still seemed tickled by the idea.   “My father took his NEWTs in sixth year and left Hogwarts early. He was the Golpalott Scholar for a year, and traveled to many different magical schools to study, even a full term at Durmstrang. He knows seven languages, including Mermish, German, and Goblin. Mum insisted it was she who would get so nervous around him, sure that he would throw her out of the Ministry every time she made a mistake. But he was kind to her and patient. Daddy doesn’t always have an easy time of it with people, but he was special with her. Mum said it’s because he’s a genius and his mind is different to everyone else, that we’re concerned with what we can see and touch, but he lives somewhere in another stratosphere of knowing, so infinite is his knowledge. They were perfect together.”   Harry was now firmly caught up in her spell.   “When I was born, Mum stayed home to take care of me, but she still helped Daddy with his theories and work. We had a laboratory that she would use while I painted and studied my lessons, developing charms and spells at home while Daddy was at headquarters. Sometimes, when they were close to breaking something, they would be on firecall for hours and I’d go play in the forest with the fairies. It had been like that for weeks, when one day I came back from my walk and heard a loud boom from the Rook. I went in and called Mum’s name, but it was quiet, deathly quiet. I could see some smoke drifting into the kitchen.”    Harry held his breath as he watched her deliver the news in an eerie monotone.   “When I found her, there were charred bits of wood around her and a hole in the wall. But she was lying still on the ground, and…and the spell, whatever she had done,” the girl’s voice started to waver, “it had…gutted her. There was blood all over the floor underneath her and I could see the cave in her side, the tinge of pink mass, the…the bone jutting out of what used to be my mother. I knew she wasn’t getting up, knew she was dead, but I…couldn’t…understand…why. I went back to the kitchen and finished my painting. Then I just sat there until it grew dark inside. When Daddy came home, I didn’t know what to say, so I just pointed.”  Luna paused as she remembered something and shivered.  Harry put his hand on her knee to still her.   “The screams went on for hours. Daddy was very distraught. Very, very sad. The weeks after that were a blur. There were so many people traipsing through our home that I didn’t know and they all looked at me the same way. My nana was there, she was my Mum’s mother, but Nana was very sickly and couldn’t help us much. She had been under constant care at a special facility. She held on to me so tight when she cried at the funeral, but I couldn’t let the tears come. I couldn’t feel anything. Then finally it was just me and dad again. He was on leave from the Ministry, indefinitely. I didn’t know how to help him, I wasn’t like my mother. She could usually snap him out of his depressions whenever they happened, but now, now he would spend an entire day sitting in that lab staring at the hole in the wall and he wouldn’t hear me. I would look right into his face and it was as if he had gone somewhere else, somewhere that she was still alive. So, I would go back into the forest and talk to the creatures there. They were always comforting, my only friends, really. Something I could talk to.”   “But he was my dad and he was all I had left. I had to take care of him, for both of us. When the people from St. Mungo or the Ministry would show up to see his progress, I would lie and say he was doing better, that he was eating meals now. The nurse would come once a week to give him his potions and she would help me with the wash or to cook dinner. She was very nice to me, but I could tell she was worried about something.”   “He did get better, though. Sometimes, I could even get him to take walks with me. Other times he would wander around by himself and come home just as it was getting dark. I would try to keep up with Mummy’s lessons and I started to read the books in Dad’s library. One night he came in with this big light in his face, like he’d just seen the most amazing thing. He told me that he’d come across a most incredible creature, that it was truly a great find. Borne out of legend, but now he knew it was true. He wouldn’t tell me what it was, but only said that he had lots of research to do. And so he did. For weeks. He bought more books on every magical creature ever written about. That’s how he came across witness accounts of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack and he would whisper to me how it was out there, he knew it existed, and that it was up to us to prove it to the world. He started to write lots of papers and submit them to various magazines, but no one was interested in his field of study or what he had to say. That’s when he started to get that mad gleam in his eye. One day I came home to find him dragging in a printing machine.”   Luna looked at Harry fully now, a small spark of a faded happiness in her eyes.   “He was consumed by it. He had boarded up the lab and now spent all of his time in his study writing and researching, contacting noted naturalists and scientists on the Floo. It was good to see him so full of life again, so fired up in his new passion. But he was busy all the time now. I took care of him as best I could, but I was still lonely. It had been almost a year since her death, and I only had school to look forward to. That seemed like so far away, but I would daydream about all the children I would meet and make friends with, how we would always have so much to talk about. Maybe I could even have a party for my birthday and invite them over. Daddy had forgotten all about mine.”   She suddenly gained a crease in her forehead and she shook her head at Harry. “But that was just his way, you know. He would forget a lot of mundane things, I understood that, I didn’t mind.”   Harry hadn’t spoken in all this time, and he thought he might have been unable to at this point, he somehow knew they were arriving at something. He stroked her skin and bid her to continue with a nudge of his head.   “One day, I had been doing my regular walk in the forest, doing my own research now, on the animals I found. You know, mostly drawings, but charts on their habitats and such. I had found a fairy hill in the northern patch. It was a bit farther away, but it was a beautiful day out. I was almost there when I could hear talking coming from somewhere close by. I followed the voices until I found them. Two men, sitting at a campsite. It looked like they were arguing, about what I don’t know. They had bedrolls still out, so they must have camped there overnight. I was thrilled to have someone to chat with, so I went up to them, without even thinking. I wanted to tell them about the pixies I’d found just that morning. I caught them up in a tree close to their nest. They were the funniest sight.”   Luna’s voice caught at that, and she looked down in haste. Harry could feel the air being squeezed out of his lungs slowly and a feeling like his head was swelling up three times its size.   “The men appeared delighted to see me, and they let me ramble and go on with big grins on their faces. I guess they thought I was funny, too,” she said in a strange voice. “I asked them what they were doing out here and they told me they were hunting. I didn’t like that thought; too much, but I smiled at them anyway. People have to eat, I suppose. But they didn’t have any food left, they were saying, and they were getting a bit hungry. So, I told them I could bring them something back, if they please. And I did, I brought them the sandwiches I had made for mine and Daddy’s lunch, because I could always make more. I told Daddy that I was going back out, but I didn’t tell him about my new friends.”   “When I got back, they were very happy with my gifts, and gave me hugs and ran their hands through my hair. They offered to share their food with me, but I was fine, I said. They agreed and laughed in a strange way. I started to feel funny around them. But when I tried to say goodbye and head home, one of them grabbed me. He had a scar over his eye and long brown, wild hair. He said I wasn’t going anywhere until they said so.”   Harry was definitely having problems breathing now and it was disturbing him greatly that Luna still continued to sound as if she were merely reporting the weather. There was a dull flatness to her voice that sounded nothing like her usual self.   “Then they started ripping me into little pieces. I could feel their hands tearing at my clothes, but I didn’t know what happened to my voice, like it had abandoned me. One of them pushed me to the ground and my head hit a big rock, I felt groggy and weakened, I couldn’t see very well. But they were all around me and I couldn’t get away, couldn’t keep their smells and their hands from invading me. They…they made me do things. I didn’t want to, but I didn’t know how to stop it.” She paused here and closed her eyes, keeping them shut tight as she began again.   “They hurt me very badly, Harry, very badly. I don’t know how long I’d been lying there but at some point Daddy found me and brought me back home. I didn’t know, though. I didn’t wake back up until I was in St. Mungo’s. I had already been there for a while, apparently. But I ended up staying for almost three months to recuperate. Even still, the healers said I had been damaged so severely they might never be able to repair my insides, I might never be a mother unless there were advances in the field of my…ailments.”   He felt sick to his stomach listening to her, but he couldn’t leave her, couldn’t look away from her.   “Daddy was back to his distraught self again, but he rarely left my bedside while I was in hospital. When we finally got back home, he worked very hard to make sure I was taken care of properly. He even hired a tutor to help me prepare for Hogwarts. Daddy would worry about me all the time, would worry when I was out of his sight for too long, or if I wanted to walk away from the house. But he was especially attentive to my studies about animals and creatures and he would talk to me for hours about what new beast or pest he had discovered in his reading. He told me that the sides he was printing up to hand out to the masses were now including information on the under dealings of the Ministry departments, news that he expected people would be shocked to find out. Just like the Heliopaths. He needed to make the paper bigger, have more format and content, and he was thinking on expanding it to a full sized publication. It made me happy to listen to him. But Daddy needed me to be alright, so he could move forward, I could see that. I told him I was fine, when he asked, every day. And I buried everything away and made it true. I was fine.”   She looked at Harry as if daring him to argue the point.  But Harry never moved, never uttered a sound.   “And then finally it was time to go to Hogwarts. I was so excited. Daddy had a hard time letting me go at the station, but I assured him it would be good for him to be able to get on with his work without me as a distraction. I was so proud of him, but I worried about him, too. I didn’t want anything else to set him back, I couldn’t bear it. But I wondered about it. If he was really okay, was really getting better. But I had school to take my mind off it, and then there I was, sitting in Ravenclaw and trying to talk to all the children there. I would tell them about my studies and Daddy’s work, but they would look at me strangely, as if I had just landed from a faraway place and was speaking Gobbledegook. They made fun of the way I dressed, and my jewelry. I couldn’t understand what went wrong.”   She glanced up at him again as if he might know the reason. He wanted to hug her fiercely, but let her go on uninterrupted.   “When I got back for holiday, Daddy was happy to see me, but he seemed different. He would forget a lot of things. His mind didn’t seem as sharp anymore. I started to wonder if something had happened. He was taking a lot more potions by now, although I was, too. Then my father told me the Ministry had severed all ties to him; that he had to sign several magical documents on the matter of his Unspeakable position and not being allowed to discuss any of the work that had happened. They’d given him a sizable recompense. But he was agitated now. His moods were erratic. I wasn’t sure what to do for him.”   She broke off for a moment and then looked to be readying herself for the remainder of her story. Harry had her wrist in his grip now and was afraid to let go.  “Then I found his Pensieve in the library. He had gone out of the Floo for a bit, he said, to pick up some supplies. I knew I shouldn’t do it, Harry; that I didn’t want to see it, but I had to know. I found the memory, I could tell by the color. I poured it in the bowl and looked inside. I saw my father leaving the house, mad with worry, running around the woods calling for me in a panic.”  And that was when it finally happened.   Luna started to fall apart.  Her face turned to him with her eyes bright with tears and blazing out of her crumpled face.   “Then he found me, Harry. I was…lying there, broken,” her sobs were starting to wrack through her, “my limbs all twisted the wrong way like a doll in the rubbish. And my father, my beautiful father was….oh, Harry, he…was mad, he was so lost. He kept screaming my name, and I couldn’t answer him, I couldn’t help him, I could only lie still like my mother, and then he was ripping his hair out of his head, insane with his grief and shouting to the sky in a rage. Harry, I couldn’t bear it!” the girl gripped him tight, “I couldn’t watch it anymore, I had to leave, because I knew that I had done that to him. It was my fault, Harry, I crushed him; I broke him. I can’t ever let it happen again, Harry. I won’t do that to him!”    Luna let her shudders run through him as she cried with her torturous grief, clinging to Harry as he held on to her like a rock in stormy waters. He could feel his own tears flowing down her back as she buried herself in his chest, wrapping her legs around him, and the two were molded together. She moaned his name over and over into his shirt, while Harry soothed her with shushes and rocked her in his arms.    They stayed like that for a while, letting the room grow dark as they sat there. When Harry finally thought he had her calmed down enough, he picked her up and carried her to his bed. He whispered that he would be back in a moment, that he would bring her back some water and a cloth for her face. He slipped out through the door as quietly as he could as he listened to his aunt, who was now home, and his uncle arguing over the telly about some nonsense. Everything sounded like nonsense to him now.   When he stepped into the bathroom and turned on the light, he looked at himself for a few moments, frozen as he gawked at the pale boy with blotchy eyes and cheeks, barely keeping it together, and then he suddenly threw himself at the toilet and landed on his knees, emptying out his stomach in one go. He let his own sobs rip through him, as he struggled to keep quiet, his body shuddering as Luna’s had done in her anguish. Harry hated the world in that moment, hated it with the heat of a thousand fiery suns. How anyone could want to damage such a beautiful spirit was incomprehensible to him. No, it was profane, is what it was. But he knew without question that he was her fiercest protector now. No one would ever touch a hair on her head again. She belonged to him now.   Harry crept back to his room; he bolted the door and shuffled to the bed in the blackness with only the light of the moon at the window to guide him to her. He sat beside her and helped her drink from the glass, he wiped her face clean, then he tucked them under the sheets with their clothes still on and pulled her back to him, holding her tight, his face in her neck.   “Don’t hate me, Harry,” the girl let out with her sigh.   “I could never hate you, Luna."   

Author's notes: In which Dudley makes breakfast and more truths are revealed.

Luna’s gaze swung from him to Harry and back again a few times. She was none too nonplussed by Dudley’s ignorance, however.   “Why, it’s your cousin. That’s what everybody called him after he defeated You-Know-Who as a baby.” Now it was the turn of the blonde, stocky boy to turn to Harry and goggle. Harry merely continued eating his food, his eyes cast down at his plate.   “What?  Who the fuck is you know who and how could Harry defeat anything as a baby other than a bad case of gas?” The boy shook his addled head as he tried to understand what Luna was telling him. “Do your people even have normal names or is it all hyphenated?” he asked with an exasperated shake of his head.   “She’s talking about Voldemort, Dudley; the one that’s coming after me. You know, the reason why you and your parents have to leave the house for a while,” Harry explained in a monotone. His cousin turned an intense face toward him.   “I thought that old guy who came to take you to your school was going to take care of it. Mum always talks about him in whispers like he’s a bad-ass.”   Harry just stared blankly across the table.  “He’s dead,” came his flat reply.   Dudley looked like he wanted to change the subject very quickly.   “What about you, luv? Do you get a hyphenate, too? Do they call you Luna-With-The-Smoking-Body, or is it just Luna?” he smirked as he went to put out his joint.   “It’s just Luna, but sometimes they call me Loony Lovegood,” she answered truthfully not quite understanding his moniker for her. His face wrinkled in consternation.   “Why Loony?  Is that some sort of wizard slang I wouldn’t get ‘cause I’m a Muggle?” He seemed confused by the arbitrary tag.   “Because the people who say it are arseholes, Duds. Just drop it, okay?” Harry demanded as he stood up to clear the table of their empty plates.   “Whaaa? You mean they’re taking the piss? What a bunch of chuffers if they’re calling you names instead of asking you out,” he insisted but Harry turned again from the sink to glare at him. “Yeah, alright…you cleaning up, then? I got places to be and schedules to keep, you know,” he said casually as he pulled out a shiny object from the pocket of his track suit. His thumb started to pad across the buttons and then he was holding it up to his ear.   “Piers, you ponce, wha’chyu doin’?” he spoke into the piece. There was a pause and the big teen laughed. “Yeah, me head was throbbing this mornin’, too. But I’ve got these big, lovely pools of silvery splendor I’m looking into right now, fixin’ me up, right quick.”  Dudley looked straight at Luna and winked. “Nah, I’m looking at her eyes, you twit.” There was a loud clanging over from the sink as Harry threw the frying pan in amongst the dishes and cautioned Dudley with a scowl, his green gaze narrowed to slits.   “Yeah, I’m not going to answer that. My mad cousin is already looking at me like he’s about to pull a Bateman,” Dudley laughed again. Luna got up to help Harry out and brought the rest of the debris on the table over to him as she went to grab a towel. Muggles had a strange sense of humor, she decided.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Much later, after Dudley had left, and the teens had cleaned the kitchen. then themselves as they sat in their bath, Luna and Harry went over plans for the rest of their few hours together before they’d have to take Luna to her pickup point.He had fucked her hard in the bathtub and it had left quite a sopping mess for them to clean up as water had surged up over the sides in great waves while they went at it. Afterward, he had dried her hair again, brushing it in long strokes lovingly as he watched her in the mirror. He had dressed her back into her tight, flouncy outfit once they got back into the bedroom, fitting her in a lacy bra first but insisting she put her clean knickers away in her bag. He even put her trainers back on her feet and tied up the checkered laces for her. Luna felt very cared for.It was Harry who suggested that they might as well spend the rest of their day at the park, basking in the glorious sun and bringing a picnic lunch for later. He said he didn’t have the energy to be arsed to do much of anything other than have sex with her and make out and perhaps chat. She had simply given him her dreamy smile at the idea and he had then grabbed her neck to bring her lips back to his.Whenever Harry kissed her, everything inside Luna fluttered. She had never felt so alive until when she was with him, all of her nerves singing together in some kind of discordant tune. Shel didn’t know what she was going to do without his body around her at all times, without being able to feed on the current of power shooting from his fingers and tongue and cock, nor feeling him grab for her tightly throughout the day and relishing that pulsing aura as it folded into hers. It was going to be a difficult process to resume her regular life.When the two were set to head out, they clomped down the stairs and made up sandwiches in the kitchen. Harry went to look for a picnic basket, and Luna followed him out into the foyer, watching him open the cupboard door under the stairs and start to pull away old suitcases and boxes in his search. She came up behind him to help move the items around as they hunted for the weaved case.As she slid back a long colorful box with some sort of netting inside, Luna saw a picture on the wall. It was a child’s rudimentary drawing of a boy, scribbles of spastic dark lines in a halo around the head with two circles representing glasses on the face. There was a frown in place of the mouth. Underneath the crude artwork, was a title scratched out in wobbly capital letters. It said, FREAK.“What’s this, Harry?” Luna asked, her voice calm and mildly curious, but her insides feeling funny. She knew who the drawing was meant to be.“Oh, um, I guess I must have doodled it when I was a kid. Must’ve been bored,” Harry mumbled, clearly uncomfortable at the discovery. He tucked his head under some coats and hauled out the object of his hunt, smiling tightly at her in victory, but ready to back out of the closet in a hurry.“Why were you in the cupboard drawing pictures?” she asked, needing to investigate the matter further until she had a proper explanation. Harry clearly did not want to discuss it any longer and he bristled at her gentle probing.“It’s nothing; I was…staying in here for a while, is all.  It’s not a big deal.”He seemed torn, not wanting to elaborate but at the same time not wanting to brush her off. Luna thought about how he’d helped her the night before by just listening, and she tried to stay patient as she waited for him to finish. She peeked back at the dark space that followed the upswing of the stairway and noticed that some of the boxes were sitting on a cot. When she looked back at Harry, tears had pricked her eyes and they were blinking to hold them back. Harry watched her face and shook his head righteously.“No you don't, don’t do that, Luna. Stop that right now. It’s just a bloody cupboard; they didn’t beat me and toss me in a dungeon, for fuck sake.” He looked away from her and visibly swallowed, his anger making his body glimmer before her.“How long did you have to stay in here?” Luna ventured quietly. She couldn’t give it up; she needed to know what kind of life he had grown up in now.“Till my Hogwarts letter came,” he replied in a throaty mumble.He stared at her blankly. “It’s hardly comparable to the nightmare you went through, so don’t even bother getting all upset about it, Luna. Yeah, it was creepy, yeah, I didn’t like it much, yeah, I’m probably more than a bit claustrophobic because of it, but so what; I’m a big boy. I’m over it. It was hardly the worst thing to ever happen to me,” he finished darkly.Luna felt some of the tears escape and trickle down along the side of her nose. She thought about how the little boy, Harry, had been trapped in this god awful space so far away from her, the two of them both lonely and sad in their fates but not aware of each other, and she wished with all of her heart that she had met him then, had found him so she could love him from the start.“What did Hermione and Ron say about it?” she wondered, expecting that Harry had pulled much of the same fit.“They don’t know anything about it,” he acknowledged.  Luna was surprised at that.“But they’re you’re best friends. Don’t they ask about your past? Aren’t they curious about how you grew up with your family?” she insisted.“We don’t talk about that shit, Luna. The only reason I know about Ron’s family so much is because of all the time I’ve spent with them. I couldn’t tell you the first thing about Hermione’s parents other than they’re dentists, or what she does when she’s on summer hols.” He explained it to her as if one would be daft to discuss these things with your mates.Luna started to imagine terrible things in Harry’s upbringing with his odious wardens and she felt a swell of bitterness rise in her gut at their likely treatment of him. She continued to press Harry who only stared at her in forewarning.“Did they hit you?”He sighed and looked up at the ceiling with a shake of his head.“What do you want me to say, Lu? Yeah, I got spanked whenever I did something they didn’t like, which was pretty often, but it wasn’t so much once I had them figured out. Vernon liked to think the belt would straighten me normal every now and again, but that’s only when I did something to really scare the shit out of them; you know, my magic out of control and me having no clue how it happened. It all tapered off before I started school, though, and they were too afraid to touch me after I started, so it was water under the bridge by then.”There was a fierce flare of anger in her chest and she breathed heavy with the pain, wondering what it had felt like for Harry and how he was able to bury all that resentment of his aunt and uncle. She started to understand something about Harry’s temper and suddenly felt the urge to know more about its roots.“What did it feel like?” she pried in a hushed awe.  Harry watched her carefully trying to read her purpose in asking.“What do you mean? How did it feel to be swotted on the arse?” Luna slowly nodded her head while her big vacant eyes held his gaze with an intense expectation. She wanted Harry to show her how it had felt for him, wanted to feel what the little boy had gone through at his uncle’s hands.Harry had taken a few steps towards her, that pouncey look of his back full in his face, his burning green irises stalking her minute moves. His voice came out in that deep timbre thick with his desire.“Would you like me to show you, Luna?” The two teens regarded each other for several minutes as the crackles of something invisible in their flowing energy rose up around them. Luna moved her head in that same slow hypnotized nod as she tried to breathe while the pressure between them pushed up against her sternum.Harry stepped up against her and put his hands to her waist, pushing her backwards into the darkness under the stairs. When he had backed her against the cot, he reached behind her and pulled off the boxes, turning to toss them out into space at the door. He looked back to her and demanded she turn around to bend over. Luna pulled up her skirt from her knees and bent on the rickety cot as her hands moved up further to lay flat. The dust was thick in the air around her, stuffy and cloying in the musky aroma of old, hidden away nostalgia.Yet she didn’t think about any of that when Harry’s hands were pulling up the skirt of her dress up over her back and he was feeling her arse like he was testing out fruit in the market. He let one hand slide between the ravine in her backside and he brushed his fingers over her wrinkled bud and then down to her already soaking folds. He sounded happy to feel her wetness.“I’ll show you what it’s like, alright. When you’re bad, you take your punishment and you save it up. You concentrate on every bit of feeling and you remember it. Then you savor it for when you really need it,” he instructed. Luna listened with rapt attention.  It was quiet for a few minutes, and her anticipation felt suspended in some kind of limbo as she waited for him to say something else.Then she heard the resounding smack of hand on flesh throughout the little dark nook and the pain of it caught up a second later. She grunted at the sharpness of feeling but Harry was rubbing her skin where he’d hit her, his fingers rough while kneading the sting out of it. He gave a slow exhale. Then came another slap and the shock of it surprised her even more than the first time.The third strike felt even more intense in its delivery and Luna started to squirm. He kept going, however, and pretty soon shel had stopped bothering to count as she tried to do what he’d told her. Harry was starting to acquire a pattern to his spanking, but he grew frustrated as the encroaching walls interfered with the swing of his motions, limiting how much wallop he could part in the impact.Luna felt her body being lifted up by her waist and she allowed Harry to move her about at will, eventually being settled on his lap as he sat underneath her on the cot and turned her partially sideways. He now appeared to have more freedom in his movements and the first thing he did was spread her open wide as she hung there. She held on to the side of his leg and let her head droop down against the bar of the smelly, poor excuse for a child’s bed and when Harry began smacking her again, much harder this time, she soaked up everything she could about the experience, relishing the way he lavished his attention on her and the way the burning against her arse melded into the sexual thrill of her open cunt. She could hear her whines grow louder, but all the while her body moved into his hand and she rutted her crotch against whatever part of his leg she could come up against.Soon, Harry noticed her winding hips and he moved the slant of his legs so that his knee was right against her sex. She promptly humped his leg like a dog and Harry purred to her with encouragement as he spanked her with a hand that felt like a wooden board at this point.“Yeah, that’s it, you want it, kitten. You want me to fuck you again, don’t you? Your fanny is gaping at me. Even while your arse blisters and burns, you little sex freak. Gods, the things I’m going to do to that arse,” he moaned against what she imagined was quite a bit of pain in his hand.At a certain point, Luna was simply lost in the pain of it and let it wash over her as she fixated on her body’s center, that throbbing between her open legs calling to her. As Harry’s slaps came up against various parts of her hindquarters and up around the fleshier globes, Luna reached for her orgasm in a blinding push, feeling like she was trying to break the surface of an ocean as she swam up from its depths.She heard her cries eclipse the smacking sounds in the dank little space and she thought about Harry, just a scared little boy, laying in here at night wanting his mother, and the ache she felt at the image tore her up, tore that climax from her throat and she rammed Harry’s leg into her crotch hard, wanting to make him happy, wanting to show him that she could be there for him. Her eyes saw nothing but stars for a moment and she felt a great shudder run through her from one end to the other.  She slumped over in one more cry, going still with the last expulsion of breath and not even noticing that he had stopped moving except for a trembling in his limbs.An exhausted Luna felt his fingers curl into her hair and pull her head upwards, pulling her mouth to his as he kissed her like a man on fire. “Oh, Merlin, Luna, my god,” he kept muttering between breaks in his assault of her lips. Then Luna was letting her body fall to her knees as she reached for his bulging jeans and Harry quickly followed her train of thought and opened his pants, the two pulling them down together again and Luna devouring him in one go. He grabbed the long hair that he had so carefully groomed into clumps around his fingers and pulled her head back and forth toward his pelvis.Luna didn’t even feel like she was on Earth anymore, but hurtling somewhere beyond the troposphere as she prepared to break into the cold void of space. Yet her physical body felt aflame, as if the zero temperature of nothingness was the last resort to extinguish her burns.Harry’s running commentary continued.“Oh, fuck, you dirty girl, suck me just like that, yeah, yeah, deeper, take it deeper, unnnnhhg, fuuuuck, good…gawwwwwwd, fucking gorgeous cocksucker, you’re mine, Yes!” and he exploded into her mouth with a shout, Luna gobbling up what didn’t shoot straight down her throat with all the fervor of her last meal.It was much later before the two finally made their way outside, Luna’s belongings hanging over shoulder and the cloak ready to be slung over her head. Harry had taken her up to the bathroom after their passion was spent in the cupboard, insisting that he alone would put away the assortment back into the closet, then running up to dust off her now slightly dingy white dress with a wet towel, brushing the cobwebs out of her hair and generally straightening her appearance. He had cooed over her neck as he watched her in the mirror, praising it as a piece of art for its elegance and promising to find a way to complement it with the appropriate adornment. His eyes took on that wicked green glimmer as he mused over possibilities. Luna had purposely left her butterbeer necklace at home, but somehow, she didn’t think that was what he had in mind.  She smiled at him airily, nonetheless.Then the couple headed down to the kitchen and stepped out into the dazzling sunshine.

 Harry had finished putting away the last of his clothes and items he was bringing with him in his rucksack and was now trudging it down the stairs. Not being able to use his magic really sucked. He’d sorted everything out the day before, and the pile waiting to go in the dustbin sat in the floor of his room. Hedwig’s cage sat waiting on the first floor with Harry’s Firebolt.It was finally time to be gone from this place, he tried to comprehend. Dedalus Diggle and Hestia Jones had taken the Dursleys and were en route to their new hideout. It had felt bittersweet for Harry to see Dudley go. Why the two couldn’t have become friendlier sooner was unfortunate, but he shook Dudley’s hand and promised that he’d contact him as soon as things were safe again. Dudley had wished him luck, with everything, he had added with a wink.Vernon had remained his usual arsehole self, but for some reason, Harry had hoped that perhaps Petunia would have something to say to him about his mother before she left, some word of comfort to her nephew or just an acknowledgment that he was even her family. Alas, she had waltzed out the door with nary a look back at her pseudo-son, leaving a chill in her wake that Harry ignored and quickly dispersed in his refusal to be disappointed.It had been a difficult adjustment getting used to Luna’s absence these last four days, as sexually charged as he'd felt with her.  She had only been with him briefly, but it had been an intense visit, and even though he’d gone right back to his furious masturbating the day after to make up for the loss of her body, it had been wholly unsatisfying.He’d spent the remaining time waiting for his cavalry in a sort of sexual limbo, theorizing over the possible reasons behind his quirks while wondering how soon he could be inside her again. This had all conspired to leave him in a rather restless state, and now his body virtually hummed with anticipation for the next wave of operation.When a roaring sound had surprised him, he’d headed to the kitchen to watch as a host of witches and wizards had suddenly appeared in the back yard. He stared at his friends and cohorts, now gathered around him in the shiny white space, with a buoyant heart. Yet, even as his affection bubbled up in his chest, it was tempered with a maturity that observed them in their real faces. Their vulnerabilities were as evident to Harry as their strengths, and he wondered if this was part of his knowing, that his journey with Luna had imbued him with the wisdom of a man finding his way in the world.He listened intently as Moody explained the means for their flight and the circumstances surrounding their early departure. Harry had put up the usual resistance when the crusty Auror had pulled out the Polyjuice Potion, and his companions were quick to make light of his worry while imparting a silent insistence. Harry couldn’t help but notice Professor Lupin’s discomfort, however, and when Tonks suddenly flashed a ring in his face announcing their betrothal, the discomfiture grew to out and out embarrassment.Harry found it curious; shouldn’t his old teacher be grinning from ear to ear? If he’d just been married to a hot piece like her, he wouldn’t be sheepish about it, that’s for sure. Harry’s eyes glanced over the woman’s breasts as he pretended to admire her small diamond, her loud tee-shirt tight enough to highlight them in a most flattering degree. Yeah, Lupin was weird if he didn’t take full advantage of those and to hell with what everybody else thought.But then he’d had to put up with his mates’ transformation into his doppelgangers and that was when things got even weirder. It was bad enough when Hermione suggested with a squeal that Harry, in golden potion form, looked tastier than Crabbe and Goyle and Ron’s face had burned. Of course, Harry’s mind immediately went to an image of his bushy haired best friend sucking him off and getting a mouth full of his “taste”; he felt his nipples harden at that.He closed his eyes and his mind chanted in a steady beat, stopitstopitstopit, but then people started to switch clothes and seeing himself in various states of undress with his flesh exposed like that started doing a number on his prick. The sexy picture of having seven of him surrounding Luna and being able to do all the things he wanted to try all at once was overpowering and to his mortification he was soon exhibiting an erection through his pants.He choked and tried to use a chair as a screen, standing behind it while they finished.  Then all of a sudden there was a general titter around the group. Hermione’s bespectacled Harry eyes got really, really big as she froze in a bit of shock, while Ron’s Harry face just got redder and the twins started chuckling like mad. Even Fleur gave a startled mon dieu! before adjusting her face to a sexy grin, and it was pretty empowering for Harry to see his face look like that when she snickered to her husband-to-be's perplexed face.Harry got a very funny feeling. But when the whiny Mundungus gave a saucy cry and declared, “Oh, hoho! Haven’t felt wood like that since me days with the Frommer sisters!” the boy knew he was busted. How he was sharing the effects of his arousal he wasn’t so sure, but his face flushed all the same.“Er, you eager to get a move on, Harry?” George, or maybe Fred started to smirk, his twin quickly adding to the teasing.“Yeah, does the threat of imminent danger give you a boner often? That would explain a lot,” and the two suddenly speccy, raven-haired brothers cracked up at the idea.It was now becoming clear to the rest of the uninitiated, non-Harry’s just what was happening and a few looked at the original with some pity. Harry was sure he must be the color of lobster in a pot. He tried to calm himself down as he stumbled through an apology.“Er, uh, sorry. Really sorry about that. I-uh-don’t know where that came from.” The twins only laughed harder and now Ron was starting to join in their guffaws. Hermione still looked appalled. If possible, Lupin looked even more uncomfortable as he gave Harry a funny look.“Well, that’s very odd. I’ve not seen a reaction in the counterparts before,” the tattily-dressed werewolf informed them. Harry's oversexed brain got a vision of Remus buggering his new bride and he audibly groaned into his hands as he covered his face.“Sorry!” he exclaimed again at his fortified stiffy.Perhaps he needed a nice cold shower before they left. He thought about just how dangerous a mission this could be, what he would do if any of his friends were hurt as they fleed, and that snapped him out of his heightened state right quick. He took slow breaths and managed to bat down the raging surge of hormones, only looking at the rest when he felt completely under control.He knew his face bore a guilty expression, but there wasn’t much he could do about things now. He moved on and asked Moody how the cluster would pair off. The amused gleam in the Auror’s good eye was not lost on the boy.Moments later, Harry was stuffing Hedwig and her cage into the sidecar of Hagrid’s motorbike as best he could and praying to whoever would listen to keep his friends safe as they all prepared to steal away into the encroaching darkness.
