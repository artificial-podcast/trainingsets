“Sweetheart, slow down!”Adele Corden ‘s arm was almost being ripped from it’s socket as her daughter, 11-year-old Adelaide Corden, was dragging her along the narrow path between other families on the stones leading up to platform 9. Her husband, Faustus, was leisurely strolling behind them, pushing the cart full of his daughter’s belongings.“We’re almost there, mama!” Adelaide beamed with joy. She could not wait to get through to the other side – to finally see the Hogwarts Express – and to attend Hogwarts.She had been so happy upon receiving her letter in the mail early that summer. Adele was almost positive that the word most spoken by her daughter was either Hogwarts or magic. For the entirety of the summer months, Adelaide focused herself on learning as much as she could about what she would be learning during her time at Hogwarts.Her mother, Adele, told her all about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry the different houses. The majestic school sat in the highlands of Scotland and to this day, Adelaide’s mother is extremely adamant about it being her favorite place of all time.“Remember what I told you?” Adele would question her daughter, a bright smile on her face as she would continue sweeping the front porch of their home, that was nestled in the beautiful village of Ottery St. Catchpole.“Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus!” Adelaide would chirp happily, licking the tip of her forefinger as she turned the page of the book in her lap.“And what does that mean?”“Never tickle a sleeping dragon, Mama.” Adelaide giggled.Adelaide was a bright young girl. Putting aside the fact that their family home was rather small, Adelaide came from two very well-off pureblood families. For the first eleven years of her life, she learned about magic from both of her parents. Adele, her mother, and her father Faustus Corden.Faustus and his wife Adele were opposites. Having met while studying at Hogwarts, Adele in Hufflepuff, and Faustus in Slytherin.Polar opposites.Neither adult had a clue what house their daughter would be sorted into. Truly, she had so many qualities that could help sort her into any of the four Hogwarts houses.At a young age, Adelaide has already shown courage and bravery – like Gryffindor. She is loyal and honest – like Hufflepuff. She certainly values intelligence and wisdom – like Ravenclaw. And just like her father, Adelaide was a natural born leader full of determination and ambition – like Slytherin.“Oh! Is this it? Is this where we have to run through the wall, Mama?” Adelaide had stopped running now. Her large blue eyes were wide with wonder. She was turned to look up at her mother, who truly was just an older version of her daughter. They shared the same eye and hair color. Adele often made the joke that she created Adelaide all on her own. Her father, Faustus, was a tall, olive-skinned, and dark-haired man. His wife and daughter were fair skinned, blonde hair and blue eyed. He had always hoped that maybe one day they would have had a boy, a son to look just like him. But that was not the case. Faustus and Adele were blessed with one child only – and that was Adelaide.“Want me to go first?” Faustus was now standing behind his wife and daughter, ready to walk through the wall to step onto platform 9 ¾.Adelaide let go of her mother’s hand and turned to look at her father. A smile formed on her lips as she moved closer to him, grabbing hold of the cart beside him. “Can I go with you?”Adele smiled, stepping back, and allowing her husband and daughter to rush forward, disappearing directly through the wall. Adele swore she could still hear Adelaide’s giggles from the other side.Once the entire Corden family was standing on platform 9 ¾, Adelaide spun around to get a better look at her surroundings. The entire platform was bustling with families, first years saying goodbye to their parents and younger siblings, older students who had been through this process many times. Adelaide was amazed by it all.She was even more amazed at the girl, who looked to be about the same age as her, standing not too far away with her own parents with bright pink hair.“Mama, do you think she is a metamorphmagus?”Adele looked over to see what her daughter was talking about. “Yes, baby, I think so!” Adele smiled.“I’m going to be friends with her!” Adelaide proclaimed with a nod. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► After a happy, yet tearful goodbye with her parents, Adelaide found herself wandering the corridor of the Hogwarts Express. She came upon an empty carriage and slowly slipped inside before plopping down by the window. The train had already been moving for a little over a few minutes when the door open to the bright pink-haired witch.“Wotcher! I’m Tonks.” The bubblegum pink tresses tied back loosely in a messy bun at the crown of her head. “Can I sit in here with you?”Adelaide grinned widely, slamming the book on her lap shut rather quickly at the aspect of becoming friends with this girl – just as she had told her parents.“Yes! My name is Adelaide Corden. It’s nice to meet you.” Adelaide couldn’t help but wonder if Tonks was her real name.“I know what you’re thinking. I can see it written all over your face.” Tonks chuckled, but had done so with an extremely serious look on her face. “My real name is Nymphadora Tonks. But I hate my name. Don’t call me that. Understand? It’s Tonks.”Adelaide blinked. “Oh, yes. Yes of course, I understand!”At this point, she would do anything and everything to have a new friend. Even if it meant ignoring the rare and beautiful real name of the pink-haired witch sitting across from her.The two girls were getting to know one another and it had already been halfway through their journey to Hogwarts when the door opened up again.This time, it was a lanky, red-headed boy standing there with wide eyes.“Hi.” He cleared his throat, shifting his weight from foot to foot nervously. “My older brother Bill didn’t want me to sit with him and his friends. Can I sit with you?”Adelaide nodded while Tonks shook her head ‘no’.The blonde-haired witched looked over at her first new friend, giving her a look. “Of course you can. My name is Adelaide Corden. It’s nice to meet you.” She held her hand out to him, a wide grin forming on her lips. “And this is Tonks… Just Tonks.”Tonks raised her hand in a greeting before looking back out the window.“Hiya.” The boy reached forward and shook her hand. “The name is Charlie.” He took a seat beside her before continuing. “Charlie Weasley.”Adelaide smiled, “It’s nice to meet you, Charlie Weasley.” ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►  The rest of the journey to Hogwarts was quick. Adelaide got to know her two new friends and vice versa. She explained how her mother was in Hufflepuff and her father was in Slytherin. That had gotten her two odd stares from both of her companions. She had a feeling that they may be nervous that she would be sorted into Slytherin.Would they not be her friend if that were the case? She remembered her Papa telling her that many people didn’t like those who were sorted into Slytherin. Adelaide remembered asking, “Well what about you and Mama?”Faustus had laughed, giving his daughter a quick kiss on her forehead. “Your Mama was special, my little dove.”The boat ride was something out of one of Adelaide’s storybooks. Her eyes were still blown wide, her fingers toying with the loose strands of her hair as she took in all of her surroundings.The rather large man – she thinks she heard him introduce himself as Hagrid – gathered all of the first years and brought them into the castle.Tonks was on her left, and Charlie on her right.“This is incredible!” She beamed with a smile.Charlie nodded in agreement. Tonks shrugged.“I can’t wait to see what I can get into around this place.” There was a smirk now creeping up onto Tonk’s lips. She glanced over at Adelaide and Charlie with a laugh.“I’m afraid I’ll get lost!” Adelaide sighed, chewing on her lower lip as the crowd stopped moving. They were now waiting outside of the great hall. A tall, thin witch stood in front of them, introducing herself as Professor McGonagall, explaining the sorting process.It had gone by too fast. Before Adelaide knew it, the sorting hat – the thing was just plain creepy, honestly – was already close to calling her name.“Corden, Adelaide!”Stiff with nerves, Adelaide stood still and didn’t make start making her way towards the hat until she looked to Tonks and Charlie, both of whom smiled and nodded to her.“Good luck!” They chorused, grinning ear to ear and clapping their hands with everyone else.Slowly walking towards the hat, Adelaide tucked hair behind her ears and took a seat on the stool. Professor McGonagall placed the hat on her head and Adelaide had to bit her tongue from screaming out once she started hearing the voice inside of her head.What was happening? Was she being taken over?“Mama and Papa didn’t tell me this part…” She thought to herself, closing her eyes for a moment.“Adelaide Corden. My, My…” The voice began, “You are already quite the witch…”Adelaide felt like this way taking too long. Was there something wrong with her? Before she knew it, the hat was ready to announce to the rest of the school what house she would spend the rest of her time here at Hogwarts in.“Ravenclaw!”Adelaide smiled warmly, relief washing over her as Professor McGonagall took the hat from her head and showed her where to go.The rest of the sorting ceremony went slow now that Adelaide was sitting at the Ravenclaw table, alone.Tonks was sorted into Hufflepuff, and Charlie – just like his older brother – was sorted into Gryffindor. They waved to one another once they were all sorted.Adelaide had never eaten so fast, eager to get into Ravenclaw Tower to see what the next seven years of her life would look like.She had a feeling adventure was lurking right around the corner.

S E P T E M B E R 1 9 9 0“Charles Weasley!”Adelaide was moving as fast as she could through the crowded corridor. Her perfectly tailored, blue school robes billowed behind her as she rushed through the crowd of students.The red head whom she was chasing after turned slowly, leaning against the opening of a little alcove at the end of the corridor. He had a wide grin on his lips and hands tucked down into his pockets of his messy robes.“Hello.”With a raised brow, Adelaide reached forward and slapped Charlie’s arm. “Where were you on the train?” If anyone knew Charlie better than he knew himself, it was Adelaide. It was not like Charlie to not sit with her, and Tonks. Ever since meeting each other in their first year, they made a pact to always sit with one another during their journey on the Hogwarts Express.Charlie blushed, rubbing his arm after Adelaide had slapped him. He knew it was out of character. And honestly, he was glad it was Adelaide who came after him and not Tonks. The Hufflepuff could really pack a punch.“I was, uh, sitting with Percy. Mum wanted me to spend some time with him.” Charlie nodded. He thought maybe that would be a believable lie. He felt bad, although Adelaide was extremely intelligent – she was quite gullible. At least when it came to her friends.“Why?” The blonde witched demanded, her eyebrows raising high onto her forehead as her arms delicately laced within one another over her chest. “Is he having trouble making friends, still?”Charlie nodded, almost too enthusiastically. “Yeah… yep! Poor bloke. He’s been so snippy and can’t seem to keep any of his old friendships. Mum is really worried about him.”Adelaide seemed to buy the story Charlie was telling her. But the truth was – Charlie had been sitting with another seventh-year student who he knew had relatives working at the Romanian dragon sanctuary. It was no secret that Charlie had an intense love of dragons and all things magizoology. He had not even told his family his plans.Plans that would take him very far away. Indefinitely.He knew Adelaide would be heartbroken with him leaving. They had been extremely close for the last six years. After having met on the Hogwarts Express during their first year they had been quite attached. And although they were sorted into different houses, they realized that they had always lived nearby one another and that their fathers worked together at the Ministry.Every free moment during the school year, they could be seen together. Outside on the school grounds, in the library, even in the Great Hall. Adelaide always climbed onto the bench beside Charlie at the Gryffindor table. Professor Snape was not a fan of her blue robes clashing in a sea of red. And would always be known for deducting house points from both Ravenclaw and Gryffindor because they refused to part ways with one another.Adelaide did whatever she could to spend time at the Burrow during the summer months. Molly was like a second Mum to her – though nobody could take her Mama and Papa’s place - she loved the entire Weasley family something fierce. Charlie, especially. He was just the only one too blind to see it.“Well, anyway,” Adelaide took in a deep breath, “I guess I should be heading to the common room. It’s getting late.” Her blue eyes scanned the corridor that was slowly starting to empty out. The first feast of the school year was finished, and curfew was about to start. “Unless you want to take a walk. To our usual place?” Adelaide asked lowly. A hint of hopefulness could be heard in her voice as she spoke up, fumbling with the ends of her hair that had been tied back into a braid, slung over the front of her shoulder.Charlie smiled warmly, “Sure. Let’s go.” Charlie nodded his head in the direction of their special place. The “Come and Go Room” as Charlie called it. Adelaide did not like that name – but could never come up with anything better.As smart as she was, Adelaide was not completely sure how this room worked. But she knew that anytime she would walk along the seventh-floor corridor with Charlie and Tonks, or even by herself, the doors would always appear. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► It had only taken a few paces back and forth for the doors to appear. The room materialized within was cozy. Sofas and armchairs with throw blankets and pillows had furnished the floor in front of a dimly lit fireplace. Adelaide slipped herself free from her robes, now just donning the skirt, button up shirt  and tie that made up her Hogwarts uniform.“Can you believe this is our last year here?” The blonde witch draped herself over armchair dramatically, letting her head hang over the edge.Charlie smiled, watching his best friend make herself at home. He would miss these moments, of course, but he was also excited to leave it all behind for Romania. And the dragons. Especially the dragons.Taking off his own robes, Charlie plopped down onto the sofa and leaned his head back against the cushions. “It’s bloody crazy, that’s for sure.” Charlie sighed. The past six years had gone by quickly. Charlie and Adelaide barely spent any time apart. They were attached at the hip – during school and out of it.Spending the summer holidays between the Burrow and the Corden residence was something Charlie would miss the most. Late nights laying on the grass, counting the stars. Adelaide reciting all the research she had read earlier that day about the constellations nestled high in the sky.“Have you a clue about what you’re going to do after this year is over?” Adelaide lifted her head and looked over to Charlie with a small smile. “I know Kettleburn is itching to know what you decide to do. I think he considers you his eventual replacement.” She giggled.Bloody hell, she is wasting no time. Charlie thought, chewing on his lower lip. He lifted his head as well, making eye contact with Adelaide for a moment before looking back up at the ceiling. He was trying to imagine looking up at the star-covered sky outside of the burrow, instead of the relatively high and ornately decorated ceilings of the magical room he was in now.“Dragons, Addy.” Charlie whispered, barely loud enough for her to hear.“What?” She pushed herself up and dropped down onto the sofa besides him now. “Dragons?” She inquired. Her head tilted off to the side, causing some hair to fall into her face at the angle change.“Yes. Dragons.”Charlie sat up, turning to face Adelaide now that she was sitting beside him. “I feel so connected to them. You know I love magizoology more than anything else.”Adelaide smiled sadly. “I know, dragon boy.” She reached forward and brushed some of the curls from his forehead. “Are you going to leave?” Adelaide questioned him.She really didn’t want to know the answer, though. A part of her already knew that he would leave. Charlie had a wild spirit – wilder than Tonks even. She knew Tonks wanted to become an Auror, so she would never be too far away. But Charlie? She knew he was destined for adventure. More adventure than she could probably handle.The silence was all Adelaide needed to know his answer.“Mama wants me to become a healer.” She quickly changed the subject, looking down at the wand in her hands. She twirled it around for a moment, letting out a sigh. “She said I’m too good at it to choose another career path.”In truth, Adelaide was not sure what she wanted to do. She was probably the only student in all of Ravenclaw who did not have the rest of their life already mapped out.“And I know she is probably right.” The blonde continued, absentmindedly shooting blue sparks out of the tip of her wand before placing it down on the cushion beside her.“You are really good at healing, Addy…” Charlie reached over and grabbed onto his best friend’s hand with a smile. “But what do you want to do?”“See, that’s the problem!” Adelaide groaned, lacing her fingers with Charlie’s and holding his hand on her lap. She never thought it was weird that they were close like this. Though, Tonks always got weirded out when Adelaide and Charlie would show affection to one another. According to her, they were too weirdly intimate and might as well shag and get it over with.That had never happened, though. The relationship was strictly platonic, no matter how hot and bothered Charlie’s touch had made her. It was like some kind of unspoken rule between the two of them. They were terrified of ruining their friendship – something that meant more to Adelaide than a quick shag with the Gryffindor quidditch captain who just so happened to be her best friend.And that was the thing – if they had ever decided to test those waters would it be a one-time thing? Adelaide had to shake her head to remove all thoughts of a shirtless Charlie beneath the Ravenclaw blue sheets of her four-poster bed.“I don’t know what I want to do.”“You have time to figure it out, Addy.” Charlie gave her hand another squeeze. “You have time.”   ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►   J U N E 1991 “Wotcher Addy!”The final day of classes had finally come to an end. Tonks was beaming ear to ear, her hair a bright bubblegum pink. The short strands sticking up all over and it was evident that she had just rolled out of bed to meet Adelaide in the great hall as they had promised one another.“Were you just napping?” Adelaide grinned back to her best friend, wrapping one arm around her shoulders in a half-hug. She gestured to the messy bed head the metamorphaghus was sporting.Tonks smirked, “I had to catch some shut up so I could be ready to party tonight. I already bet some Gryffindors that I could out-drink them. I can’t lose now.”Adelaide giggled with a quick shake of her head. She knew Tonks would not be the only one partying that hard. “Can you believe it? We’re finally finished!” The blonde cried with excitement, though her eyes were still roaming around the clutter of other students around them. She was searching for Charlie, who was nowhere to be found.“I just can’t wait to start my Auror training,” Tonks moved to sit down on the stone bench, making sure to leave enough room for Adelaide to sit down beside her. “We’re finally going to be adults. No more rules, no more studying.”Adelaide raised a brow, “Tonks, you do know that you will probably have to study during your Auror training, right?” The blonde laughed softly, though her eyes were still searching for the familiar redhead.For a split second she thought she saw him, but it was just Percy.“Perce!” Adelaide called out, waving her hand up in the air to get his attention. Once she had it, Percy made his way over to them with a sheepish smile.“Hi there, Adelaide.” He then glanced to Tonks. Honestly, she was quite scary, so he gave a quick nod before looking back to Adelaide.“Do you know where your brother is?”Percy shook his head. “Haven’t seen him. But if I were to guess, he’s probably outside with Professor Kettleburn.”Adelaide smiled. Why didn’t she think of that? “You’re probably right. Thanks Percy!” She watched him walk away before turning back to look at Tonks.“Weasley is so far up Kettleburn’s arse.” Tonks rolled her eyes, “I’ll meet up with you later, Addy. Go find him….” Tonks paused, pushing herself up from the bench and turning to look at her friend. “And do everyone around you a favor?”Adelaide raised a brow, her head cocked to the side as she waited for Tonks to continue.“Tell the bloody bastard you love him already. The goo-goo gaga eyes are making me sick to my stomach.”“What!” Adelaide gasped, “I don’t love him… I mean, I do. He’s my best friend. But so are you!”Tonks smirked, already walking backwards and away from Adelaide. “It’s not the same and you know it!”Adelaide sighed, staying where she was as she watched Tonks saunter off through the crowded corridor. It appeared to her that everyone had the same idea. It was time to celebrate. She could hear the hushed whispers from the students that were successful in sneaking alcohol back to their dorms from their latest Hogsmeade trips. Adelaide knew each house was throwing their own end of the year party. Adelaide would attend Ravenclaw’s before slipping into the Gryffindor common room with Tonks by her side – those lions always threw the best parties. She was not afraid to admit that. And after studying so much and working so hard all year, Adelaide knew she deserved a break. A reward, really.She found herself walking out of the castle and down towards the courtyard.“Addy!”Hearing her name being called, Adelaide looked up and smiled. Charlie was waving up to the blonde witch, walking up the hill towards the castle after having met with Professor Kettleburn.Safely tucked away in the pocket of his trousers was a small silver spoon. It was a strange object to have chosen, but Charlie looked up to Kettleburn and wasn’t going to question his choices. He knew the spell to use to transform the simple object into a portkey.Having failed his apparition test a few times, Charlie felt it was necessary to utilize another mode of transportation to get to Romania. That is where Professor Kettleburn came into play. He was helping Charlie start his dragon studies. He had provided the portkey, assisted in housing, and set him up to meet one of his dear old friends who was head of the sanctuary. Charlie was set.Well, almost.Now all he had to do was break the news to his best friend.

By the time Adelaide had made it back to her dormitory, changed into a royal blue – shocker – sundress and walked down into the Ravenclaw common room, the party was already in full swing. Drinks were being tossed back and forth and typically Adelaide tried to stay away from anything involved firewhiskey when she was not with Charlie and his older brother, Bill, but tonight she had once again concluded that she deserved to celebrate.She deserved to unwind and enjoy herself – or at least try to do those things, anyway.“Addy!” Charlotte Winters was standing by the armchair in the corner of the room, waving her arms excitedly up in the air to gather the attention of the blonde witch.“Char!” Adelaide grinned and slipped through the crowd to walk up to her roommate for the last seven years.“Tell me you’re not going to leave us for those Gryffindors again?” Charlotte teased, nudging Adelaide in the ribs with her elbow before handing her a cup full of the amber liquor she had just been thinking about.“Not right now, no.” Adelaide took the cup, thanked Charlotte, and sat down in the chair with a loud, dramatic sigh. “You know I love you, but Charlie is my best friend. I can’t help that we were sorted into different houses.” Adelaide laughed softly, tucking a wild strand of hair behind her ear as she turned to look at her friend.“Aye…” Charlotte rolled her eyes teasingly, “Best friend. Right.”“Not you too…” Adelaide sighed again, taking a rather large gulp of the liquor before scrunching up her nose in disgust. Merlin, that stuff just did not taste good. Why was everything always drinking it?“I see the way you look at him, Addy. Bloody hell, everyone sees it. Except him, of course.” Charlotte teased her.Adelaide sighed softly. She knew she had been having those forbidden feelings more often recently. She refused to act on them. No matter how close Charlie would lay beside her… No matter how long he would hold her hand for or how he would kiss her forehead. Thinking of the little touches and looks caused butterflies to flutter around Adelaide’s stomach. Was she in love with her best friend? Or did she just not know any better?She had a few boyfriends throughout the years at Hogwarts, but none of the relationships had ever developed any further than just innocent hand holding and some kisses. Ok – maybe a few heated snogging sessions in dark and empty corridors…and that was it!“You all drive me insane. Every, last one of you! You know that?” Adelaide rolled her eyes, finishing the cup of firewhiskey with another large gulp. She was already feeling the effects. She was what Bill called a ‘light weight’. Bloody Bill Weasley, Adelaide thought to herself with a grimace.“Gah! That stuff is disgusting.”

◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►

Reluctantly, Adelaide spent the next two hours chatting with the rest of the Ravenclaw seventh years. She had finished three cups of firewhiskey in total and was heavily feeling the effects now. Her eyelids felt heavy, but she fought to keep them open as giggles escaped her lips. She allowed her feet to carry her, clumsily, out of the common room and down the corridor.“Charles!” She screeched happily, seeing the familiar redhead waiting by the staircase for her, just as they had planned earlier that night.“Blimey, are you wasted Addy?” Charlie was concerned, but he also could not help but laugh as his strong arms wrapped around his best friend’s waist once she got to him after running the rest of the corridor, holding her up against his side.“Yes!” She giggled, wrapping her arms loosely around his shoulders, holding herself up against him. “Mmm, Charlie. You’re quite fit, you know that?” She whispered, wagging her eyebrows at her best friend. She was too busy trying to remain upright to spot the blush crossing his neck and cheeks as he helped her down the staircase.“I’ve been told quite a few times. Mostly from Mum.” He joked, a laugh escaping his lips as he hurried them along the shadows of the corridor. The last thing he knew Adelaide wanted was to get caught out of her common room after curfew, not to mention she was intoxicated – even if it was the last day of school before the end of the year.“Come on, you’ve got to be quiet.” He whispered, pressing his finger to his lips, signaling to Adelaide that she needed to stop making noise.They made it to the portrait of the Fat Lady which opened to the Gryffindor common room. Charlie looked up to the Fat Lady and while ignoring her condescending and judgmental stare, he spoke the password.“Caput Draconis.”Luckily, she decided to keep quiet and let the two students in. Charlie dragged Adelaide beside him, hurrying over to the couch before letting her down onto the soft cushions with a heavy breath.“We did it!” Tonks quickly jumped over the back of the couch to land beside Adelaide, grinning up at Charlie once she realized she had stolen his spot.“Nymphadora!” Adelaide exclaimed, leaning into her friend, and hugging her tightly. “How did you get here?”“Adelaide Rose Corden.” Tonks grumbled, glaring at her friend though a hidden look of amusement was on her face. “It’s Tonks. Just Tonks!” She told her, patting her head.“And I’ve been here waiting for your sorry arse! I can see the Ravenclaw party had plenty of firewhiskey.” Tonks leaned forward to sniff Adelaide’s breath with a grimace.“How much has she had to drink already?” Tonks was now looking up at Charlie.“No clue. Probably not much, Bill always said it took a few sips and Adelaide would be ready to… what did he say again,” Charlie took a second to think, “Oh, yeah. Paint the town red.” He shrugged, grabbing himself another drink. “Whatever that means.”Tonks let Adelaide rest her head on her shoulder, though she knew it would not last long because Tonks was infamous for being unable to sit still.“She’ll get a second wind, I’m sure. You mind watching her? I’ve got some…friends to meet.” Tonks grinned deviously.Charlie knew what she was referring to, of course. “Have fun. And be safe.” He warned with a laugh.Tonks gave him a two-finger salute, gently slipping from beneath Adelaide’s head before sauntering off to find the person she was looking for.Charlie replaced her spot on the couch quickly. He slipped an arm around Adelaide to help keep her up. Letting his eyes roam over her soft features, he let out a sigh. This was going to be a lot harder than he thought. He should have left as soon as Kettleburn gave him the portkey. Instead… he decided to let the night play out.Maybe Adelaide would be too intoxicated to remember their conversations. Maybe he should not tell her. Maybe he will just write a letter. Yeah… a letter is good.“Charlie?” Adelaide blinked and looked up to her friend slowly.“Yes, Addy?”“Can I sleep over tonight? I don’t think my legs will make it back to my dormitory.”Charlie chuckled. “Of course, you can stay with me. Bed is big enough for the both of us. And it’s not like we haven’t slept in the same bed before, either.”Adelaide blushed. “Charlie, I think the last time we shared a bed we were twelve. Seventeen and twelve… that’s a very big difference.”Charlie shook his head, “Ah, not really. At least not to me.”“Yeah, it is. I have boobs now.” She stated matter-of-factly. She nodded and crossed her arms over her chest, almost accentuating her breasts now.“Yep… You’re right. You’ve got uh-boo…” He stopped himself. He couldn’t continue with a straight face. He burst out laughing and threw his head back.Adelaide joined in. “What is so funny!” She cried, looking down at her chest now. “If you are making fun of my breasts, I will have to find something about you to laugh at you know. It’s only fair.” She raised a brow, letting her eyes roam over him for a moment. “Or I’ll tell your Mum that you were being mean. I’m sure she’ll find some awful chores around the house she can make you do this summer!”

Charlie laughed again, shaking his head. “I’m a bloody angel in Mum’s eyes, Addy. You know that!”She stayed silent though, tapping a fingertip to her chin as she tried to look deep in thought. “You’ve got…”Charlie tried not to blush as he felt Adelaide’s heavy gaze on himself. What would she say about him? Merlin, this was embarrassing. He hoped nobody was listening in on their conversation.“Well, I don’t know. You’ve got something.” She reached over and poked his abdomen. “Like that! It’s like you’ve been secretly working out. Where did the muscles come from? Because I’m pretty sure you don’t get like that from flying a broom.”Blushing at the feeling of Adelaide pressing her manicured fingernail into his stomach, Charlie shrugged. “What can I say? I am a ruggedly handsome stud. I was born this way.”At that, Adelaide let out a loud guffaw. “No you most certainly were not born that way.” She said, shaking her head.“What the bloody hell does that mean?”“It means you weren’t always so fit!” She told him with a shrug.“Well, that’s just rude.”Charlie knew she was joking around and did not let her statement affect him negatively in any way.“I’m sorry.” Adelaide turned serious quickly. She leaned over and pressed her lips against his cheek. “You are my handsome best friend. Now can we go to bed?” She pulled back and pouted her bottom lip out as she waited for him to respond.“You’re lucky you’re cute. C’mon, let’s go.” Charlie sighed, pushing himself to stand before helping Adelaide stand up after him.It had taken them ten minutes to walk to his dormitory. He was tempted to just pick her up and sling her over his shoulder but decided against it – people would probably talk more about seeing that then they would about them casually walking up the stairs together. Right?“Do you want a change of clothes to sleep in?” Charlie turned to face Adelaide after he closed the door. She dropped down onto his bed and slipped her sandals off.“Just a shirt, maybe?” Adelaide started pulling her hair back from her face into a braid, tying the ends and flinging the hair behind her shoulder.“Sure.” Charlie nodded and quickly walked to the trunk at the end of his bed. He pushed the top open and found the largest shirt he owned before handing it over to Adelaide.“Thanks.” She smiled and twirled her finger around, indicating that he needed to turn around.Obliging the command, Charlie stood up and turned around completely, his back now facing the bed.“I think I want to visit Paris before my healer training starts in a month.” Adelaide spoke softly, slipping the sundress from her shoulders before pulling it down until it pooled around her feet on the floor. She had not noticed that there was a mirror on the opposite side of the room so Charlie having turned around didn’t really do much.And being the gentleman that he was, Charlie only stole a quick glance before closing his eyes and hanging his head low so that if he did open his eyes again, he would be looking at the ground.“Paris? What made you chose Paris?” Charlie questioned.Adelaide slipped the shirt over her head and let it fall down her body, the bottom hem hitting the middles of her thighs. She leaned down slowly, trying not to fall over, to pick up her dress. She neatly folded it and walked over to Charlie before dropping the dress on top of his trunk.“It’s the City of Light.” Adelaide shrugged, tapping his shoulder to let him know he could turn around again. “I wanted one last adventure, I guess.” She turned around to crawl into Charlie’s bed, slipping her legs beneath the blankets as she propped herself up with the pillows.“I was going to see if you, or Tonks, wanted to come with me. I think we could have a lot of fun.”Charlie smiled sadly. He kicked his shoes off, reaching into his back pocket to grab his wand. He went over to the empty, clean glasses on his bedside table.“Augamenti.” He whispered, conjuring water from the tip of his wand to fill the glasses. He handed Adelaide one, insisting that she drink the entire thing.“Thank you.” She whispered to him after finishing the glass of water. She was already feeling a bit better, not having had any alcohol in over an hour or so now.“You’re welcome.” Charlie finished his own before setting both glasses back down. “Now move over. And don’t be a blanket hog tonight.” He teased.Adelaide giggled, shifting over a bit, curling up on her side as Charlie slid into the bed behind her. Her discussion of visiting Paris seemed to have left her mind because she rolled over now to face him. “Can you believe we’re never coming back here? Well, I mean, you might. I truly think you would be a bloody wicked care of magical creature’s professor.” She told him with a nod.Charlie laughed softly, reaching over to brush some hair from her face. “Yeah?” He shook his head, “That sounds too boring for me, Addy.” He admitted, chewing on his bottom lip as he shifted to get comfortable with the pillow beneath his head.Adelaide sighed. “I know, Charlie.” She told him, snuggling just a bit closer before she found herself wrapping her arms around his waist, laying her head against his chest.At this contact, Charlie stiffened just a bit. He sucked in a deep breath, letting his arm drape over her waist as she laid against him. “You know? What do you mean?”“Yeah, I mean I know that you’re meant for bigger and better things.” She told him with a nod, her forehead rubbing against the crook of his neck before she pulled back to look up at him.“And that’s why I love you.”Charlie sucked in a deep breath and held it in. He looked down and made eye contact with Adelaide. He smiled and without thinking, he leaned down halfway, Adelaide had already been leaning up the rest of the way. Before long, their lips met with soft pressure.Charlie moved his hand to the side of Adelaide’s face, cradling her cheek gently as the kiss slowly began to deepen. Her lips parted against his and he let his tongue dart out to taste her.This was wrong. She had been drinking and he knew this was wrong. Reluctantly he pulled away, his forehead pressing against hers for a moment before he let out a deep sigh. “I think it’s time for bed, Addy.” He whispered down to her, shifting to press his lips against her forehead.Trying to banish the tears that started to well up in her eyes, Adelaide nodded. “Goodnight Charlie.” She whispered, rolling back over now with her back facing him.

 ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►

It had not taken Adelaide long to fall asleep. Charlie found himself watching her back and waiting until she was completely asleep before sneaking out of bed. He sat at his desk, shifting things around as quietly as he possibly could. He took out his quill and two separate pieces of parchment.Dipping into his inkwell, Charlie quickly scribbled a letter to his Mum. Using magic to quick dry the ink, Charlie folded the letter, placed it into an envelope before setting it off to the side.Taking in a deep breath, he shifted back in his chair and glanced over to the sleeping girl – no, woman – in his bed. She looked so peaceful. Beautiful, really.He was a coward. He could not say goodbye the normal way. Well, he could. But he was refusing to. There was a difference.After watching her sleep for what felt like hours, Charlie went back to his piece of parchment and quill.

“Dearest Adelaide,

I’m sorry that I’m writing you to say goodbye. I know that you will be angry with me,so I guess I’m being a coward, taking the easy way out.

This is something that I need to do. It’s my calling.”

Charlie paused and let out a deep breath. He was not sure what else to write. How else could he explain to his best friend that he was leaving and never wanted to come back? Romania would be his new home. The dragons, his new family. He set the quill down and looked back over to his best friends sleeping form. She really was beautiful. Her pale skin and blonde hair looked like they belonged tangled in his Gryffindor red bed sheets. It was a shame that he will never get to see this again.

“Dragons, Addy. Dragons.

With all the love in the world,

Xx Charlie”

“Addy?”“Addy? It’s time to wake up, come on.” At the sound of her name and a gentle shove against her shoulder, Adelaide rolled over and let out a groan. The spot on the bed beside her was already cold to the touch.“Hm?”Slowly opening her eyes, she was expecting to see Charlie standing over her, but it was actually Percy. He looked confused and a bit upset. “Perce?” Adelaide shifted to sit up, making sure the blankets were pulled up to cover her bare legs. “What’s wrong? Where’s Charlie? What time is it?” The blonde started riffling off questions, blinking a few times and looking around to see what was going on around her. The curtains hanging around the bed, for privacy reasons, were tied back on one side so all she could see was Percy standing there.“I’m so sorry, Addy.” Percy began, sucking in a quick deep breath. “I…” He sighed and slowly handed her the folded letter that he had been holding behind his back. “This was addressed to you, and I read it. I’m really sorry, I didn’t mean to read it.”Adelaide raised a brow but took the letter from his hands. “What are you talking about?” She shifted a bit more up in the bed, opening the parchment and glancing down at the writing. It was Charlie’s, she recognized it, too, from the moment she saw the word ‘dragons’.It was like everything around her stopped progressing forward in time. Her hands froze as she clutched the parchment and her eyes scanned the letter over, and over, and over again.What was this? Was this some kind of joke? Where was Charlie?“I don’t understand…” She whispered, though the feeling of uneasiness started taking over as her stomach churned and her chest started feeling tight.“He left?” She looked at Percy. “W-Why would he do that? In the middle of the bloody fucking­ night?” Her voice was started to waver, tears brimming at her ears as she pushed the blankets off from her legs and stood up.Out of respect for her state of undress, Percy turned around and crossed his arms over his chest.“There’s a letter for our Mum, too. I think he went to Romania to that sanctuary he had been talking about.” Percy explained, squeezing his eyes shut as he heard Adelaide rush around behind him, the shirt going flying in the air past his head as she pulled her dress from the night before back on.“I got that much, Percy.” She snapped angrily. Reeling herself back in, she took in a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t snap at you. I’m angry.” She let one hand rest on the side of Percy’s face before forcing a smile. “And not at you.” She finished, slipping her feet back into her sandals before she snatched the letter up again and before Percy could blink – Adelaide escaped the dormitory and fled down the stairwell to the common room.Tonks had spent the night – where, Adelaide was unsure, but she was still lingering about. Most likely waiting for Adelaide and Charlie.“He left.” Adelaide exclaimed, shoving the letter into Tonks’ chest before she frantically started pacing in front of the sofa. “He bloody left in the middle of the night. Bloody dragons, Tonks. Dragons.”The Ravenclaw witch was doing her best to remain calm, but the panic was starting to set in as she began remembering the night before.“Oh Merlin… I kissed him last night. I told him I loved him.” She cried, covering her face with her hands before she dropped onto the sofa next to her friend.Tonks remained quiet, her eyes roaming over the letter before she looked over at Adelaide once she was no longer pacing back and forth like a mad man. “Deep breaths, Addy. Relax. We’ll figure this out. Did he leave anything else? I mean, where exactly did he go? Romania?”Adelaide nodded, keeping her eyes shut as her head leaned into Tonks’ neck. Tears were breaking free from behind her eyelids, and the sniffles had already started, too. “He left that letter for me, and one for his Mum. That’s it. I just don’t understand. Why didn’t he tell us? Why didn’t he say goodbye? Do you think I scared him away?”Tonks was never too good at comforting Adelaide when she got flustered like this. Though, to be fair, Tonks had never seen Adelaide this way before, so this was like entering on new territory. “T-There there, Addy.” Tonks robotically patted her friend’s back. “Let’s get some food in ya, and then we can figure out what to do.”Adelaide was not even close to being hungry. The last thing on her mind was food. All she could think about was Charlie. And Dragons. Then more Charlie. It was like a never-ending cycle. Why couldn’t he had just told her his plans? They were supposed to be best friends, after all.Was it because she told him she loved him? No, that couldn’t be it. They told each other that many times over the past seven years. She had just never kissed him before. But the more Adelaide thought, as she aimlessly walked back to her dormitory, the more she remembered. Charlie had kissed her back. He had met her halfway. He was the one to deepen the kiss. Could she have done or said something to have made him stay? Or at least not leave the way he did. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► S E P T E M B E R  1993“Poppy?” Adelaide pushed open the large, and quite heavy, doors to Hogwarts’ Infirmary. Her blonde hair was tired at the base of her skull in a bun, and bangs had been cut to hang against her forehead.“I mean, “Adelaide quickly corrected herself, “Madam Pomfrey?”Poppy was standing beside her desk, going through some paperwork. “Ah, Ms. Corden! Look at you!” Madam Pomfrey was beaming, looking over to her new assistant for the year. Although she swore she did not need the help, Professor Dumbledore thought it would be a good idea to have Adelaide come finish her healing studies with Poppy at the school.“And please, darling,” Poppy grinned, “You’re an adult now. You may call me Poppy. After all, that is my name, no?” She teased, giving Adelaide a warm hug before pulling back at the sound of someone else entering the infirmary.“Ah, Professor Lupin.” Madam Pomfrey gave him a nod. “I’ve got what Dumbledore requested for you over here. Give me one moment to gather everything together.” Poppy then left the main waiting area, walking into the glass door that led to what Adelaide assumed was her office.Adelaide turned to face the man who Poppy greeted. He did not look familiar to her, but she had called him Professor. He must be new. Adelaide found herself assuming he was this years Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Her and Charlie always swore that position was cursed.“Good Morning.” Adelaide greeted gently, a small smile forming on her lips. She took a few steps to get a bit closer, extending her hand out. “Adelaide Corden. I’ll be working with Poppy this year for training.”Remus looked to her hand with a gentle smile, reaching out, he grasped her hand in his and gave it a firm shake.“Remus Lupin. I’ve taken up the Defense teaching position.” He introduced himself.While Adelaide was listening, she couldn’t help but do a quick once over of the scars on his face. The wheels were already turning in her mind, if whatever Dumbledore requested from Poppy were to do with why he had the scars.“I figured that much. I’ve only been gone from Hogwarts for a few years now.” The blonde laughed softly, turning back to face Poppy who walked over with a small bag, gently handing whatever was inside to Remus with a solemn nod.“Just let me know when you’re running low.” Poppy whispered, now walking back off to count inventory. Adelaide watched her go, knowing she should follow along to help as much as she could.“Well, I believe that’s my cue. They’re not paying me to stand around now, are they?” She joked, though took a moment before letting out a laugh. “Actually, I don’t think they’re paying me at all.” She shrugged, awkwardly tugging down at the hem of her black jumper.“It was lovely to meet you, Ms. Corden.” Remus smiled, giving her a nod. “I’m sure we’ll see each other around.”“I’m sure we will. I think we may be the youngest staff members. We’ve got to stick together. There are a few students I know that will give you a run for your money.”Little did she know, the newest professor had already met Ronald Weasley and his friends, Harry Potter – yes the boy who lived - and Hermione Granger, on the Hogwarts Express.  

J U N E 1991 Once the portkey was activated, Charlie began to feel the tight pulling sensation just below his navel as he was swept into nothingness. Just as fast as he vanished, Charlie had appeared outside of the Romanian sanctuary having landed roughly on his feet. The last thing he remembered seeing was Adelaide sleeping soundly in his bed, Charlie blinked and knew the portkey was successful.He blinked a few times, rubbing at the back of his neck before looking up at the building before him.“You must be Charlie Weasley?” A rough voice called out from the dark.Charlie jumped a bit, turning to look behind himself as he came face to face with a tall, olive-skinned man.“Yes, sir.” Charlie nodded.“The name’s Hugo.” The man reached forward, slapping Charlie on the back. “Welcome to Romania.” Hugo grinned widely. “Let me show you to your cabin.”Charlie followed along in silence, already in awe of his surroundings. It was quiet, which he was surprised. Honestly, he was not sure what he was expecting. Dragons making noise all the time, maybe?“I know what you’re thinking, mate.” Hugo laughed, glancing over at Charlie, dangling a set of keys in front of his face. “It’s quiet.”Charlie laughed sheepishly, a small blush appearing on his cheeks. He hoped these people would not think he was just a kid and that he should not be there. After all, he was eighteen years of age. And he really was well versed in all thing’s dragons, but he had no idea what to expect from a sanctuary.“Yeah, honestly, I was thinking it would be a bit noisier.” Charlie admitted with a grin.Hugo handed Charlie the keys. “Aye, it’ll get noisy. Just wait another…” Hugo pulled out the watch from his pocket, glancing at the time. “Let’s say another hour. It is still early. Our lot likes to sleep in.”Charlie took the keys and walked to the front door. Upon entering, Charlie noticed that everything was already furnished, and the kitchen was stoked with the essentials.“Get yourself settled in. Breakfast is in thirty minutes in the main mess hall.” Hugo went to walk out of the door, though turned back to Charlie to explain where he could find the main mess hall.This was it. The beginning of the rest of his life. Unlike other professions, Charlie was not thinking of this as just another job. This was going to be his life – he would make sure of it.After unpacking what he brought with him, which was not much, Charlie sat down at the kitchen table and quickly penned two letters.One – to his parents. He wanted to let them know that he was safe and that he would check in as often as he could. That he would find out if the sanctuary had any floo network connection so he could at least see their faces and they could see his.Two – to Adelaide. He knew the letter he left her, explaining his absence, was not enough. He knew she would be angry. He had a feeling he would have to send quite a few, probably unanswered, letters to her before he got any kind of response.Checking the time, Charlie ran his fingers through his messy curls, pulling them back from his face before standing from the table and stuffing the letters into his back pocket.He was dressed in an already dirty pair of blue jeans, and a black t-shirt. Nothing fancy. After all, he had a feeling he would get messy his first day of learning the ins and outs of working at a dragon sanctuary. Making sure his boots were tied tight, Charlie locked the front door behind himself and headed off in the direction that Hugo had directed him to.The sun was starting to rise slowly along the horizon. It truly was a beautiful sight. Charlie had only wished Adelaide were there to witness it with him. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► D E C E M B E R 1991 “Charles Weasley!” Molly’s voice was loud and shrill. Her hand was raised and before anyone around them could blink, she had slapped her second eldest son across the cheek.“How…dare…you…leave…like…that!” She exclaimed, smacking his upper arm now in between each word.Ginny, Charlie’s ten-year-old sister, stood beside their father, Arthur. Giggles escaping her lips as she watched their mother wail on her older brother.“Ok, Ok, Molly, dear…” Arthur spoke up, walking closer to remove his wife from Charlie’s side so she would stop smacking him. “It’s his birthday, darling, we don’t want to ruin the day.” He whispered to his wife, a smile appearing on his lips as he clasped his son’s hand in his, giving it a firm handshake.“Happy nineteenth birthday, my boy.” Arthur beamed.Molly sighed, glancing to her youngest, who was still giggling away as Charlie rubbed his arm – the second oldest child of Molly and Arthur swore he could already feel swelling. Molly Weasley, nee Prewett, sure packed a punch.“Thanks Dad.” Charlie smiled, shaking his father’s hand in return. He then hugged Ginny, kissing her forehead.“You’re almost on your way to Hogwarts. I can’t believe it.” Charlie said, shaking his head.Molly sighed again, crossing her arms over her chest for a moment before she threw her arms up in the air and busied herself in Charlie’s kitchen – preparing them some sandwiches and tea for lunch.After lunch, Charlie found himself under interrogation from Molly.“You’ve made that poor girl sick to her stomach. Leaving like that. Let’s not forget your poor Mum…me!” Molly exclaimed, a hint of sadness in her voice. The matriarch had that deep feeling that her son was never returning home again. And al though she could come visit him, and vice versa, it just was not the same.Plus, his line of work as a Dragonologist was extremely dangerous. It worried Molly to the core.Charlie felt ashamed of the way he left, but he knew it was easier on himself to do it the way he did.At the mention of Adelaide, though, he perked up. “Adelaide?” He spoke softly, chewing on his lower lip. “How is she?”Molly rolled her eyes, “You would know if you hadn’t run off to… this place. It’s so dangerous, Charlie, I’m worried for you.”Arthur stayed silent, his eyes following Ginny who was investigating the living room and the shelve of books Charlie had. There were pictures he made sure to take with him.One, of the entire family taken during last years Christmas festivities. Then there was one of him with the entire Gryffindor Quidditch team, when he was captain. Another with Adelaide and Tonks. And then one with just himself and Adelaide. It was one of his favorites and had been taken during one of their summer holidays.Adelaide was perched delicately on the homemade swing Arthur had built himself the muggle way (because he was so fascinated with muggle tools that summer, but let’s not go into that, he still had a few scars to prove he was not a ‘handyman’). Charlie was behind her, hands wrapped tightly around the ropes that were tied to the plank of wood. They both had smiles on their faces and truly looked happy.That was the summer Adelaide turned Sixteen. The summer Charlie started to notice she was… well, that she was a girl. And not just his best friend.“It’s safe here, Mum.” Charlie spoke up, glancing to his father – almost silently begging the man for some support on this. He wasn’t going to get it, though.“I’m getting used to their behaviors. Hugo said I’m picking things up really quickly. I’m happy.”Molly sighed, reaching forward and patting Charlie’s cheek gently. “I know that you’re happy… I just wish you could be happy at home. Or at least closer to home.”“Has she asked about me?” Charlie questioned hopefully. “She…She hasn’t answered any of my letters.”Molly shook her head. “Not since the summer, no. She just started studying at St. Mungo’s. Just the other day, she stopped by. She looks good. Happy, I think.” She shrugged, nervously playing with her fingernail now.“She doesn’t want us telling you about her, Charlie. You’ve hurt her.”This time it was his father who spoke up.“Faustus thinks she just needs some time to cool down. It’s only been six months, so… just give it time.” Arthur continued, glancing between his wife and son. Ginny, still being nosey, now entered the kitchen to sit at the table with them.Charlie nodded. He would give her whatever time she needed – he had just hoped that eventually she would speak with him again. He missed his best friend.They had left a lot of things unsaid. Charlie knew that was his fault. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► D E C E M B E R 1991“Happy Christmas, Addy!” Tonks leaned over the edge of her chair, pecking her best friend’s cheek as she slid her a gift across the table.Adelaide grinned, “Happy Christmas!”The two, both busy with furthering their education and training for their careers, had agreed to meet in the Hogs Head for lunch the day after Christmas. They wanted to exchange gifts, like they usually did, but since this was the first year after leaving Hogwarts, it would look a little different.“How is Auror training?” Adelaide questioned, sipping her butterbeer slowly before slipping a gift across the table to Tonks.The witch’s hair was bright bubblegum pink still, a grin spread wide across her lips.“It’s bloody brilliant, Addy! Tough, but Merlin, this is everything I thought it would be and more.” Tonks went into further detail of everything she had already learned, explaining how much of a hard ass her supervisor was, but that she respected him for it… at least until he called her by her full first name. At the recollection of said memory, Tonks’ hair turned a deep red.Adelaide explained how her studies were going. She still was not sure what type of healing she wanted to pursue. There were so many options, and while she was undergoing the schooling, she would at least get a chance to learn and participate in all of them to see where she would best fit.After opening the gifts, Adelaide ordered herself another drink. Absentmindedly looking at the third empty chair at their table, she sighed.“Thinking of Charlie?” Tonks questioned bluntly.Always straight to the point, Tonks was.“Fuck.” Adelaide groaned, covering her face with both hands for a moment. “I just can’t help it. I’m still angry, you know?” She admitted with a shrug.“Molly and Arthur took Ginny to see him for his birthday. They asked me if I wanted to come… and when I said no, I also told them not to tell him about me and what I was doing.” Adelaide chewed on her lower lip for a moment before she took a hefty swig of her butterbeer.“Is that childish of me? I mean, it’s not like we were together… Romantically, I mean.” She explained.Tonks shook her head. “No, it’s not childish… I don’t think it is, anyway. Charlie was a bloody git for the way he left. I mean, “Tonks finished her drink, licking her lips to remove any of the remaining foam from the sweet beverage. “He didn’t even say goodbye to me at all.” She joked, trying to lighten the mood.“That’s not really the same thing, Tonks.” Adelaide groaned.With a raised brow, Tonks looked over at the blonde. “No? How come?”Now she was just playing dumb.“You know why.”“No. I don’t. Well, ok, maybe I do. But I want to hear you say it.”Adelaide rolled her eyes. Glaring over at her best friend, who now had strands of purple hair hanging messily in her face, Adelaide let out a sigh.“Because I loved him.”

S E P T E M B E R 1993The grand feast to celebrate the beginning of another school year was already underway by the time Adelaide reached the Great Hall. She had promised Poppy she would finish up counting the inventory for her so she could attend the opening remarks from Dumbledore.With having taken her hair out from the bun, her long tresses now curled down her back and tucked behind her ears. She pushed the heavy doors open, a bright smile on her lips as she watched most of the students turn to watch her walk in.She found herself gravitationally pulled to the Gryffindor table – even after having been out of school for some years now…some things never really do change.“Ronald Weasley.” She spoke sternly, narrowing her eyes at the redhead. Whispers could be heard surrounding the youngest male Weasley. Other students wondering who the woman was who was seemingly getting ready to scold Ron.Gulping quite loudly, Ron turned at his full name being called. Once he spotted Adelaide, he physically relaxed.“Bloody hell, Addy!” He cried, the look of terror that had been on his face slowly fading.“I couldn’t help myself!” The blonde giggled, grinning down at Ron as he stood up to wrap his arms around her and give her a tight hug.“You look so grown up.” Adelaide sighed, teasingly ruffling his hair before turning to look at his friends, whom she had heard of but never got the pleasure of meeting yet.“Oh, right!” Ron blushed, pulling himself away from Adelaide before turning to Harry and Hermione.“Harry, Hermione, this is Adelaide. She’s best friends with my bro-““Was, ickle Ronniekins! Was best friends with our dearest brother Charlie!”“And dumb! Don’t forget dumb!”Turning at the intrusion of not one, but two voices, during her introduction, Adelaide gasped.“Fred and George. Look at how bloody tall you both are!”Adelaide was now squeezed between the twins in a tight embrace.“We were always taller than you, Adelaide.” George joked.“He’s right!” Fred chimed in.Adelaide rolled her eyes, “Yeah, yeah, very funny you two.” She then turned back to Ron, Harry and Hermione.“Where’s Ginny?”That was the sibling she was most excited to see. She remembered first meeting the sweet, innocent little girl her first time at the burrow. All of the boys doted on her, left and right, and Adelaide remembered making fun of Charlie for the entire summer because all he could talk about was teaching Ginny about dragons when she was old enough to understand.“I’m right here!” Ginny spoke up sheepishly, raising her hand so Adelaide would notice her. She was seated a few students away from her brother and his friends.“Merlin!” Adelaide stepped around Ron and gave Ginny a half hug while the girl stayed seated. “You’re all grown up… almost!” The blonde laughed softly before quickly looking up at the long table with all of the teachers. She made eye contact with Remus, smiled when she noticed he was already watching them, before turning back to Ron.“As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted,” Ron began again, glaring over at Fred and George.“Percy!” Addy spotted the third eldest Weasley boy, giving him a wave. He smiled and waved back, though Adelaide could tell that he had become much more reserved in the years she had been out of the Weasleys’ lives.Ron huffed, letting out a deep sigh. Once he was seated back beside Harry again, he rested his chin in the palms of his hands. “Everyone always talks over me. This is just like back home.” He grunted.“I’m sorry, Ron. It’s been a while since I’ve seen all of you. I almost forgot how many there are of you bloody Weasleys.” Adelaide teased, resting her hand on top of his head before letting go and smiling over at Hermione.“As I was saying,” Ron cleared his throat, ruffling up his hair, making it even messier after he swore Adelaide ruined the style. Whatever it was.“This is Harry. And Hermione.” He gestured to both of his friends as he spoke their names.“It’s a pleasure to meet you both.” Adelaide nodded, giving them a little wave.“What are you doing here? They already announced the new DADA teacher is Professor Lupin.” Ron explained, his hands now holding a fork and knife and he was gesturing wildly towards to the front of the Great Hall with the hand that was holding the fork.“I’m studying under Madam Pomfrey in the hospital wing this year.” Adelaide smiled, “So don’t get hurt or else you’ll have to deal with me.” She teased.Hermione let out a soft laugh, “Telling Ron to not get hurt is like telling a niffler to not steal shiny things.”Adelaide snorted. This girl was funny. She liked her.“Ha ha, Hermione. Very funny.” Ron grumbled, stuffing his mouth full of chicken and mashed potatoes. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►  O C T O B E R 1993 With the dementors running all over the grounds of Hogwarts, Adelaide saw her fair share of pale and sick students in the hospital wing the first month that school was in session. Whenever she felt one near her, she would quickly rush down the corridor (or wherever she was) to get away from the sinking, dreadful feeling. She wished they would find this blasted Sirius Black already.Not like she was a happy person or anything (the dementors didn’t have much happiness to suck out of her), at least not as happy as she used to be. She still liked to blame Charlie for that.She had met up with Ron, Harry and Hermione a few weeks ago to talk them down from a plan that they were trying to set in motion after Buckbeak the Hippogriff had bitten a student who had provoked him. Apparently the student’s father was a powerful man and was involved in trying to put Buckbeak down.Now, she found herself walking with purpose down the corridor towards Professor Snape’s potions classroom. Poppy had sent her on a mission to collect a few ingredients for something in which Snape had in his own inventory.“Ms. Corden!”Turning at the sound of her name, Adelaide smiled warmly when she spotted Remus leaning out of his classroom door.“Good Morning, Professor Lupin!” She called, giving him a wave. “How are you?”Remus smiled in return. “I’m doing well. I actually stopped you for a reason.” He paused, turned back to the class, held up a hand and called, “Class, I’ll be right back.”He stepped out, letting the door close behind him as he met Adelaide halfway. “I thought I would teach them about boggarts today.” He began, clearing his throat and nervously tugged at the collar of his wrinkled white button up. “From what Minnie has said, you were a gifted student. I thought it would be nice for you to join us, maybe? If you’re not busy, that is.”Adelaide blushed. Damn Minerva McGonagall and her big mouth. “Of course she did.” Adelaide laughed softly, “Defense was one of my strong suits, so I guess she wasn’t wrong.” She shrugged, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. “Sure, I’ll join.”She followed Remus into the classroom, closing the door behind her as she then continued to follow him to the front of the classroom.“Good morning again, class.” Remus made sure to extend his voice loudly for the students who seemed to be just waking up in the back of the classroom.The mirrored chest standing tall beside Remus started to creak and shake, and Adelaide almost found herself regretting saying yes to Remus.She eyed the students, a sea of red and green, as Remus began to speak.“Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?”“That’s a boggart.” One student spoke up.“Very good.” Remus had his hands clasped behind his back as he strolled around the group of students. “Now can someone tell me what a boggart looks like?” He questioned.Hermione spoke up now. “No one knows. They’re shapeshifters.”Adelaide smiled proudly, giving the brunette a nod before glancing at Ron and Harry with a bit of a motherly glare – they were whispering to one another, and Adelaide just thought that was rude.“They take on the shape of what one fears the most.” Hermione continued, chewing on her lower lip as she heard Harry and Ron whisper to one another, watching her. “That’s what makes them so –“Remus cut her off, “Terrifying, yes.” He looked to Adelaide with a smile. “Luckily a very simple spell exists in order to repel a boggart.” He explained, now stepping closer to the chest – the current home of said boggart.Adelaide tucked her hand into the inside pocket of her robes slowly, feeling for her wand. Wrapping her fingers around the wood, she pulled it out and held it by her side as she watched Remus explain ‘riddikulous’ to the students – having them try it out without their wands. She truly missed Hogwarts. Watching Remus with the students made her wish he had been her professor.“This class is ridiculous.” Said a male student, dressed in Slytherin green, and his right arm in a sling. She remembered healing his hippogriff bite last month. Quite a crybaby that one. What was his name again? Oh, right. Malfoy. She scowled for a moment, remembering the discussion with Ron and his friends about how his father, Lucius, had gotten that poor creature sentenced to death.She wanted to speak up, tell him that it was rude to say such things and to interrupt, but she closed her mouth in a firm, straight line. Remus did not seem to hear him, anyway. Technically, no harm – no foul.“Neville, why don’t you come up here?” Remus gestured for the nervous looking boy to walk forward. Once he did, Adelaide gave him a bright smile, ignoring the laughs coming from the Slytherin students.“What are you most afraid of, Mr. Longbottom?” Professor Lupin questioned.“P-P-Professor Snape, sir.” Neville stuttered out, his eyes darting around almost as if the real Professor Snape was standing behind him.Professor Lupin chuckled at Neville, seeing Adelaide smile from the corner of his eye. The blonde witch seemed to have nodded in agreement with Neville’s fear. He then moved to Neville, whispering a few things to him, before pulling out his wand.The knob turned and clicked and within a moments time, the door opened to reveal Severus Snape. Well, not the real Severus Snape. The boggart version of him, anyway.“Riddikulous!” Neville exclaimed, alongside Professor Lupin. Instantly, the boggart (though still remaining in the form of Professor Snape) shrunk just a bit and now the faux Snape was wearing Neville’s Grandmother’s clothing.The class laughed and Adelaide covered her mouth for a moment to stifle her own laughter.A few more students lined up and after a handful of them had gone, Remus nodded to Adelaide to jump in the line.“I feel like I’m in class all over again. I’m wearing yellow underneath these robes,” She laughed, pulling out her wand now. “Does that count as house pride?” She joked.Remus smiled, “Of course it does!” He told her with a laugh of his own.“Ok, class. Now watch Ms. Corden. You haven’t already seen your own fear already in another students’, have you?” He questioned her.Adelaide shook her head. “No, don’t think so.”To be frank, she was not exactly sure what her number one fear was. But as she stepped up once the student before her casted the spell to turn their boggart into something humorous, Adelaide took in a deep breath.The shape was quickly twisting and turning until the hairs on the back of her neck stood up. Long, sharp talons. Metallic grey, rough scales. Impressively large wings. Angry, red eyes.Tightening the grip on her wand, Adelaide stood tall and stared up at the boggart that took on the shape of her worst fear.A bloody, fucking, dragon.

“Riddikulus!”Adelaide projected her voice, gently pointing her wand towards the boggart in the form of a Dragon. A bloody, fucking dragon. Of course that is what the boggart would turn into. She wasn’t bloody afraid of those creatures. She wasn’t afraid of any creature, really.Once the spell was released from the tip of her wand, the large dragon shifted until it shrunk down, just a bit, in size and turned into a canary. The bird fluttered around singing a gentle song, and a few students let out laughter at this.“Very well done, Ms. Corden.” Remus smiled warmly, gesturing for her to step aside.Adelaide let out a sigh, stepping off to the side to watch the rest of the students take their turn.It was soon the time for Harry Potter to step forward. Adelaide could not even comprehend what was happening because it happened so fast. Harry’s boggart seemed to take shape in the form of shape of a dementor.The room quickly grew silent. In the blink of an eye, while the boggart lurched forward and Harry stumbled back, Remus stepped in front of the boy and now the boggart assumed the form of what Adelaide took as a full moon, lurking behind a set of dark clouds.“Riddikulus!” Remus shouted, and just as soon as the moon started to rise higher above the clouds, it turned into a balloon and danced across the air letting out a loud puff of air.Again, the class erupted in laughter.Remus banished the boggart back into the cabinet and dismissed class. Adelaide stayed behind, noticing the way Remus eyed Harry – almost as if to make sure he was not in any distress.Once the room was free from the students, Remus turned to look at Adelaide with a smile.“Well,” He began, clearing his throat. “That turned ugly far sooner than expected.”Adelaide frowned, “Yes, it did. But I guess that is the chance you must take when learning about boggarts. Nasty little buggers, they are.” Adelaide sighed, crossing her arms over her chest as she leaned against the desk beside her.“I think some fears are unexpected, Professor.” She spoke up again, now picking at the nail polish on her fingernails as Remus gathered some documents on his desk. She had already completely forgotten that she was supposed to be gathering supplies from Professor Snape. Now after seeing boggart Snape dressed like Neville’s grandmother, she wasn’t sure she would be able to keep a straight face or not.“What do you mean by that?” Remus inquired.“Well, for starters, I am confident in saying that I am not afraid of dragons. Now, I have never come into contact with a dragon but it has never been something that I have sat down and thought about being in fear of.” The blonde shrugged her shoulders as she continued, “I mean, is that normal?”Remus took in a deep breath. A part of him wanted to go into further examination of why his fear was the full moon. Now, he was not afraid of the moon itself. More so – he was afraid of what it represented. What it…did to him. What it would continue to do to him for the rest of his life. But he chose not to. After all, his lycanthropy was a terrible secret that he would take to his grave (or at least try very hard to do so).“I do not believe it is unheard of, Ms. Corden.” Remus began, shaking his head. “I trust you not to think too much about it?”Adelaide let out a soft laugh, giving a nod to Remus as she walked out into the hallway with him. “Yes, I’ll try my best Professor.”Remus blushed, “Please, call me Remus. At least when the students aren’t around.” He told her, closing the classroom door behind them.“Of course, sorry. Remus.” She smiled. “Well, I bet be off. I still have to gather up some ingredients for Poppy… But now that I’ve seen boggart Snape in old lady clothes, I don’t know if I’ll be able to keep a straight face. The man already hates me because I think I gave him a run for his money when I was a student here.” She joked.Giving a wave to each other, both Remus and Adelaide ventured off into separate parts of the castle. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► Later in the month, Adelaide found herself watching the students gather around to attend their first Hogsmeade trip of the year. Smiling to herself, Adelaide remembered fondly all of the trips she would take with Tonks and Charlie.She noticed Harry being turned away, sullenly walking away from his friends as they continued on towards the carriages that would take them to Hogsmeade.Remembering the article in the Daily Prophet that announced Sirius Black being spotted in Dufftown, a village close to Hogwarts, Adelaide found herself being glad that Harry could not go to Hogsmeade. She usually kept to herself, other than spending some time with Poppy and with Remus, but she kept up with the news and the search for Sirius Black.Rubbing the upper portion of her arms after feeling a chill, Adelaide turned and headed back into the castle. She wasn’t sure what to do with her free time – Poppy had let her go to enjoy the day. Originally, she had planned on writing Tonks and seeing if she would like to meet up in Hogsmeade but knew her friend was terribly busy with her training.The castle was quite creepy to Adelaide now that it was empty. She wandered around each floor, speaking to a few of the portraits as she passed by.It wasn’t until she stepped onto one of the staircases and it shifted to the left did she heard the commotion. Portraits were screaming and man’s deep voice was all she could hear.“Hello?” She called, not recognizing the voice as a professor, student, or even a close by portrait.A shrill scream echoed throughout the corridor and Adelaide froze on the middle step. Her hand clutching the railing tightly as she stared up at the torn-up portrait. The Fat Lady was nowhere to be found but standing with his back to her was a straggly looking man.Within the blink of an eye, the man transformed into a black, shaggy dog. Once turned into the dog, the being turned and made eye contact with Adelaide.The witch felt like the breath she was trying to take was slowly being taken from her lungs. She felt woozy, and as her body felt towards the ground, the dog ran past and if she had not lost consciousness, she would have noticed that he stopped to sniff her, nudging her hand with his wet nose before rushing off. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►  “Move at once! Give her space! Do you hear me?”Adelaide listened to the whispers that were above her, surrounding her. She no longer felt the cold, hard marble of the staircase, but instead in it’s place she felt the soft, fluffy mattress of one of the beds in the hospital wing.Opening her eyes slowly, blinking a few times, Adelaide recognized Harry, Hermione, Ron, and the twins hovering over her bed.“She’s awake!” Fred hissed, nudging George to get his attention.All five of the students turned to face Adelaide now that she was slowly pulling herself up into a sitting position.“Merlin, my head hurts.” The blonde groaned, reaching up to feel a small gauze bandaged to the right side of her forehead. She must have busted the skin open when she fell and lost consciousness.“How are you feeling?” Hermione questioned.Before Adelaide could respond, Poppy made her way through the crowd around the bed and shooed them away.“You can all come see Ms. Corden later. Please give her some space.” Poppy narrowed her eyes, waiting for them all to walk out, though a hint of a smile appearing on her lips as she watched them all give Adelaide a wave and a smile.She turned back to the bed, “How do you feel?” Poppy asked, shifting to fluff some of the pillows behind Adelaide’s back before handing her another potion.Adelaide assumed it was something for the pain, downing it quick without question.“I’m alright, I think. My head hurts but I guess I hit it when I fell down?” She proposed that more like a question than a statement.Poppy smiled warmly, “Yes, you hit your head. Not too deep, though, you were lucky. But anyways, Dumbledore would like to speak with you. I told him to give you some space until you felt like yourself again.”“Thanks for that, Poppy. I appreciate it, truly I do.” Adelaide smiled warmly up to the healer before shifting to lay her head back down against the recently fluffed pillows.At some point Adelaide had fallen asleep. Once she woke up from her nap, another figure was seated beside the bed, a book held in his lap and head hung low as he was reading by the faint light being given off at the end of his wand.“Remus?”Startled by the sudden whisper in the dark, Remus sat up straight in the chair and looked over at Adelaide.“Oh, you’re awake!” He said softly, clearing his throat and closing the book now sitting in his lap. “Forgive me if I’m overstepping any boundaries by being here.”Adelaide shook her head, “Oh, no. No, don’t worry Remus.” Adelaide smiled and rested her hands, clasping together, in her lap. “Just surprised Poppy didn’t kick you out.”“Ah, well, she tried I’ll give her that much. Truth it, I wasn’t feeling too well myself. I think that’s what got her off my back.”Adelaide frowned, “Are you ok?”“Yes, no need to worry about me, dear.” Remus waved off her concern with a smile.There was a comfortable silence between the two for a moment more before Remus spoke up again. “Do you remember what happened?”Adelaide bit on her bottom lip. There was something inside of her that was screaming to not tell him what, or who, she saw. But Remus had been so kind to her since the start of the school year. Not to mention he made her feel safe.“Sirius Black.”“What?” He choked out. Obviously, he already knew this, but he was not aware that she had actually seen him.“Sirius Black. That’s what happened to me.” She told him with a shrug. “I mean, I guess not really?” She let out a soft laugh, flinging herself back into the pillows and winced when she realized the sudden jolt was not the right move.“Did he hurt you?” Remus questioned, turning now to fully face Adelaide, watching her intently.“No. He didn’t hurt me. At least he didn’t mean to. I remember hearing a deep voice, yelling at the Fat Lady. It stopped when I called out.” Adelaide starting aimlessly playing with the edge of the blanket that was laid across her lap.“That must have been when he slashed the portrait, and she went running. I never got to see his face. And, I don’t know what it was, but I just felt drained. I guess a bit scared, maybe? And then before I knew it, I hit the ground, and everything went dark.”Remus tilted his head to the side, the scars on his face a bit brighter in the dark, illuminated by the dim light being provided by the moon (which was not full, of course). “How did you know it was him if you didn’t see his face?”“I mean, I’m not dumb, Remus.” Adelaide laughed softly. “He was looking worse for wear just from the back, I can only imagine what he looked like head on.” She turned away from his gaze to look up at the ceiling. “He turned into a dog.”“A dog, you say?”“Yep. He must be an animagus. A large, black scruffy dog.”It was like the breath got knocked out of Remus’ lungs. It was him. This gave him all the proof he needed that Sirius was on the hunt for Harry. He needed to do whatever he could to keep not only just Harry Potter safe, but the rest of the students here at Hogwarts.“You’re quiet.” Adelaide looked back over at Remus again. “Do you know Sirius Black?”Taking in the question with some more comfortable silence, Remus let a smile form on his lips.“I knew him once, yes.”

A U G U S T 1993, E G Y P T Egypt was hot. Like dragon fire hot. As the second eldest Weasley sibling looked up to the pyramids before them, he squinted his eyes and held his hand over his forehead to try and create a barrier between the sun and his eyes. Fred and George had been acting up, having pushed into Charlie making his sunglasses go flying off his face and down the hill – lost forever.“Boys!”Molly Weasley stood beside her husband, waving her arms in the air to signal her children.“Gather ‘round, kids! It’s picture time! Oh Bill! Look how handsome!” Molly was always the first to get side-tracked. She was too busy gushing over Bill since it had been quite sometime since they had seen him.Fred and George wandered off, but not too far, though Percy, Ron and Ginny stayed near their father and Charlie.“It was nice that you were able to get some time off for this family vacation, Charlie.” Arthur grasped his son’s shoulder, giving him a squeeze. “I know your Mum is happy to have you here.”Charlie smiled, giving a nod. His hair was a bit longer now, tied messily behind his head in a bun. “I know she is, Dad.” His hand was still over his forehead, blocking the sun from his eyes.“Have you talked to Adelaide or Tonks recently?” Charlie spoke up after a minute of silence.“Not directly, no.” Arthur smiled fondly. “But I still see Faustus at work every day. Do you want to know how she’s doing?” He had let go of his son’s shoulder but turned to look at him fully.“Is it bad if I say yes?”“No, my boy, it’s not.” Arthur chuckled, shaking his head. “She’s doing well. She’s almost done training at St. Mungo’s to become a healer.” He told Charlie, now turning to watch the other children who was busy trying to keep themselves busy and out of trouble at the same time.“And, now this is something I haven’t even told the others, but Faustus says that she’s going to study under Madam Pomfrey at Hogwarts this year.”Charlie’s eyes widened, glancing over at his father. “Really? That’s wonderful. I’m really happy for her.” Charlie spoke softly. He was happy, that much was true, but he was still angry that she decided to cut him out of her life for good. He had written her so many letters, all of which – to this day – remain unanswered.“Fred! George! Get back up there this instant! It’s time for a picture!” Molly called to the twins, her voice echoing a bit which cause both Arthur and Charlie to wince, sharing a laugh.After smiling, quite painfully with the sun in his eyes, Charlie began the descent down the hill, following the rest of his family in silence. He could not stop thinking about Adelaide (and even Tonks), and what they were doing right now.Was Addy in a relationship? Did she find someone who deserved her in all her radiant glory? A part of Charlie wished the answer to that was yes – but another part of him, hidden deep down within, wanted the answer to be no.She did not owe him anything, of course. He was the one that left. And without a word, too. Maybe things would have been a bit better if they had not kissed the night before he left. Maybe it would have been better if she had not told him that she loved him.He knew she meant it in a different context to what she usually did whenever they said that they loved each other.Once the trip came to an end, and Charlie was back at home in Romania, he pulled out a piece of parchment and began writing out a letter to Adelaide. This would be the first letter in one year. He had sent so many the first year after school, to this day she still had not responded. He eventually gave up, of course, but a heart to heart with his Mum before he left Egypt helped change his mind.Scrapping the parchment repeatedly, one after another, Charlie must have thrown out a dozen pieces of messed up letters to Adelaide. Truthfully, he did not know what to say. But he knew he needed to say it. He needed to say something. Anything. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► D E C E M B E R 1993, H O G W A R T S Fall quickly turned into Winter. And winter at Hogwarts was simply magical. After the incident with Sirius Black, the Fat Lady, and a random fainting spell, Adelaide found herself working longer hours in the hospital wing, giving Poppy some much needed rest and relaxation.In the past months, she had found herself treating Harry after a fall during his Quidditch match. She was not surprised at how accident prone these quidditch players were. She could not help but remember, fondly, patching Charlie up often after almost all his matches when he was captain.Now this fall was different than all the others she had treated in the past. Harry had fallen because of the dementors. He was extremely lucky that he did not get seriously injured, or worse.It was now the Saturday before Christmas, and Adelaide found herself following along after students heading towards Hogsmeade.She had made sure Tonks was available and begged her to meet her in Hogsmeade. Luckily, Tonks had some free time and would be able to meet for a quick lunch.Tightening the scarf around her neck and the jacket around her chest, Adelaide watched her feet make indentations in the soft snow beneath her. This was one of her favorite times of year. She had only ever spent Christmas with her parents, and this would be the first year that she would be remaining at Hogwarts.She didn’t mind much now that she was an adult. She was single, so with not having a significant other to spend time with, she found herself eager to stick around and spend time with Remus. Not romantically, of course. He was smart, like her – if not more than her. She truly enjoyed his company.They’ve traded books back and forth with one another, and he had put her onto a few muggle authors that she had never heard of before.Being pureblood, Adelaide did not know much about the muggle world. She had no prejudice in her heart – she just did not know enough about them. Though having Tonks as her best friend helped since her father, Ted, was a muggle-born wizard which made Tonks a half-blood witch.“Wotcher Addy!”Grinning widely, despite the cold, Adelaide looked up and rushed towards her best friend who was standing outside of the Hogs Head Inn.“Nymphadora Tonks!” Adelaide giggled, wrapping her arms around her friend tightly.“Adelaide, please. Tonks.” Tonks groaned, though a grin was spread wide across her lips as she hugged her friend back in return.They entered the Inn, quickly warming up by the fireplace with some warmed butterbeers in front of them.“How is training going for you?” Adelaide tilted her head to the side, watching Tonks explain how her training was going. Adelaide was confused at how the process of becoming an Auror worked – it seemed a bit too complicated for her.Tonks was training diligently and hard, but still was not sure if she would officially qualify for a position until next year.“I think that’s bloody ridiculous!” Adelaide groaned, rolling her eyes as she took another sip of her drink.“Well, I will do whatever it takes to get in so it’s just something that I have to deal with, Addy.” Tonks shrugged while finishing her drink and waving her hand around to get the bartenders attention – signaling that she and her friend wanted another round.At this point, Adelaide was not going to put up a fight. Reaching back into the pocket of her jacket, she pulled out a sealed envelope and set it on the table between them.“What’s this?” Tonks tore her attention away from the bar as she watched Adelaide drop the letter between them.“It’s a letter I received this week. It’s from Charlie.” Adelaide sighed softly, rubbing at her face with both hands before her fingers raked through her hair, pulling the strands away and out of her eyes. “I’m afraid of opening it. He hasn’t written to me in over a year.”“And you still haven’t sent him anything back? All this time?” Tonks rubbed at the back of her neck, inspecting the envelope for a moment before looking back to her friend.“No. Nothing. I mean…” Adelaide sighed and took the envelope from Tonks before she could open it on her. “I was just so angry, Tonks. You would know, of course.” She forced out a laugh, shaking her head at how stupid she had been. “I’m sure one of the kids told him I was here.”She hated to admit that she had memorized the way he wrote her name. Her eyes roaming over the curved letters, her teeth nibbling away on her bottom lip. Merlin, she hated him. She hated him so much.“Trust me, I know how angry you were. I had to deal with-“Tonks paused, “I’m sorry. I meant… I listened to you cry over the bloke when he didn’t deserve your tears.”Phew. That was a close one. Smoothe, Tonks, Smoothe.“Thanks.” Adelaide sighed, choosing to ignore the fact that her best friend was just about to complain about having to be there for her in her time of need.“I think I’m just going to throw it out. What do you think I should do?”“Don’t do that. I think you’ll regret it later.” Tonks said, shaking her head. “Read it. You don’t have to answer. But… just read it.”“Fine.” Adelaide gave in quickly, slouching back in the chair with her head titled back and her eyes shut.“Adelaide?”“Hm?”“Do you know that man at the bar?”Adelaide opened her eyes and sat up, turning to face the bar now. A small smirk appeared on her lips. Without responding to Tonks, she stood up and headed over to the bar.“Remus!” She greeted cheerfully, resting a hand on the man’s shoulder to get his attention.“Oh! Hello Adelaide.” Remus grinned, closing his book, and turning a bit more to face her. “Enjoying your day off?”Adelaide smiled, “Yes, very much so. Why don’t you come and join me?”“Oh, I wouldn’t want to impose.” He shook his head with a sad smile.“Nonsense. After all, I am inviting you over, aren’t I? My friend Tonks is harmless. She won’t bite. Unless you provoke her.” She joked, turning to head back to the table, tugging Remus’ jacket sleeve to make sure he was following her.“Tonks,” She cleared her throat, choosing to ignore the blush on her friend’s cheeks for the time being (she would most definitely bring this up in private afterwards). “This is Professor Remus Lupin. He’s the new defense against the dark arts teacher at Hogwarts this year.” Adelaide smiled, nudging Remus forward, gesturing for him to take a seat between the two.“And Remus,” She sat down, sipping her butterbeer quickly to lick the foam off from the top before it melted too much into the sweet, warm beverage. “This is my best friend, Nymphadora Tonks.” The blonde gestured to the woman across from her.“Nyhmpadora, it’s nice to meet you. You have a lovely name.” Remus extended his hand and as they shook, Tonks held on just a bit longer and just a bit tighter.“Do not call me Nymphadora,” She sent a glare in the direction of Adelaide, “It’s just Tonks.” She let go of his hand and as she finished another sip of her butterbeer, she forced a smile on her lips, “Please.”Tonks was trying – at least she was slowly learning how to be not as blunt. Adelaide had tried her best all throughout Hogwarts but there was no changing the witch.Giggling softly, Adelaide watched the interaction between the two with a grin. “Yes, Remus, I apologize. Tonks is very serious when it comes to her name.” She teased, kicking her friend’s shin gently under the table.Tonks groaned, kicking Adelaide right back before turning to look at Remus.“Tonks here is training to become an Auror.” Adelaide smiled.Remus smiled after setting his mug down on the table before them, “That’s fantastic. I’ve heard it’s hard work.”Tonks nodded, trying to hide the blush on her cheeks by ruffling up her bright bubblegum pink hair to hide her face. “It’s extremely taxing, but I was born for it.”They spent the next two hours talking about almost everything, and Adelaide found herself removing herself slowly discussion by discussion and just sat back to watch Remus and Tonks interact. She could not wait to tease her best friend about all the blushing she witnessed.Once she realized that they had not been paying any attention to her, she looked down at the sealed envelope in her hands. Looking up for a moment, Adelaide slipped her jacket and scarf on.“I’ve just remembered that I needed to owl my parents to let them know my plans for the holidays.” She lied, clearing her throat as she ignored the “I know you’re lying” stare coming from Tonks.“Will you be alright heading back to the castle alone?” Remus went to stand up, as well, to put his jacket on.Adelaide smiled and rested her hand on his shoulder, “I will be just fine. No need to worry. Stay and enjoy yourself.”As she stepped around the table, she sent a wink to Tonks before leaning down to kiss her best friend’s cheek. “We’ll talk later.”With that, she hurried out of Hogs Head Inn and wrapped her scarf around her neck tightly – just not too tight, of course. Once she was situated, Adelaide started the trek through the snow and crowds of students towards Hogwarts.Once she got further away from most of the crowd, the letter found its way back out of her pocket and in her hands.“I hope I’m not going to regret this.” She muttered to herself, tearing open the seal and unfolding the parchment. ”Adelaide,

Dad told me you’re at Hogwarts, training with Madam Pomfrey. I wanted to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, no matter where life leads us know that I am always proud of you.

I hope that one day you can forgive me, Addy. I miss you.

With Love,

Charlie xx”

Reading the letter a few more times, each time the lettering getting blurrier with the tears filling her eyes and streaming down her cheeks. Adelaide took in a deep breath and held the piece of parchment to her chest.She had walked further down the pathway which ultimately led to the shrieking shack. She wasn’t paying attention to where she was walking to – she was alone, and only after falling against a snow-covered rock did she let out a sob that she had been holding back since she first read Charlie’s handwriting.“Bloody fucking idiot.” She groaned, throwing her head back and squeezing her eyes shut for a moment before she wiped at her cheeks to remove any, if not all, evidence that she had been crying.She folded the letter back up, neatly, and tucked it away before moving to stand. It was at that very moment that she heard a twig snap, not too far off from where she was standing.“Hello?” She called, wiping some more at her cheeks. The last thing she wanted was Tonks, or Remus even, to find her crying alone in the woods nearby the supposed most haunted building in all of Britain.“Bloody hell…” She muttered, squeezing her eyes shut for a moment before opening them again. Not even twenty feet away from her, nestled between the trees was a large, black-haired dog. She knew she could not be seeing things. Unless that butterbeer was spiked with something much stronger than any alcohol she had ever had in her life.She stood tall, mentally preparing to run the opposite direction if the dog attacked. But deep down, she had the feeling that he would not be attacking her. They stood in silence (obviously for him seeing as he was a dog, and all).After a moment more, Adelaide stepped forward, chewing on her lower lip. She continued walking until there was only ten feet between the two. The dog, however, took five steps back as Adelaide got closer.“I-“ She cut herself off. “Are you ok?”She paused, a laugh escaping her lips before she quickly covered her mouth. “Merlin, I’m standing here talking to you, a fucking dog. You can’t talk back. At least… not right now.” She sighed, tilting her head to the side as she watched him, trying to study his body language.“Your secret is safe with me, uh, for the most part.” She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear as she moved to lean a bit closer, now kneeling in the snow with a hand outstretched to him.“Are you staying around here?” She turned to look at the shrieking shack, further off in the distance. “Do you need anything?”Adelaide paused again. What the bloody hell was she doing? This man – though dog now – was a murderer! Why was she acting like he was some simple, wounded animal who needed a home?The dog stepped forward some more, leaning his snout forward to brush against her outstretched hand.“I know who you are.” She whispered, turning her hand to slowly run her fingertips along the dog’s head, rubbing behind his ears. “This is now a bit weird, since you’re not really a dog though, right?” She sniffled a bit, pulling herself back and moving to stand.“I’ll meet you by the shack tonight.” She told him with a small smile. “I’ll bring you some food. Because if you look like this, as a dog,” She turned to look around as she heard laughter and familiar voices in the distance, “I know you’ll look even worse once you’re back as a human.”She started to walk away, turning back to glance at the dog before he ran off.“Don’t make me regret this, Sirius Black.”  

D E C E M B E R 1993, H O G W A R T SAdelaide was not sure how much time had passed since she arrived back at her room from the outing in Hogsmeade. She was sitting, cross-legged, in front of the fireplace in her room, warming herself up. The letter from Charlie laid delicately on her bedside table. She was contemplating responding to him, but she had no clue where to begin.After all, she was still angry at him. Though – there was a small part of her who felt like she may be acting a bit dramatic. She could have visited him. She could have answered at least one letter. Right? Maybe Charlie was not the only one in the wrong in this situation.Once she felt the feeling back in her fingers and toes, Adelaide changed into more comfortable clothing. She grabbed the darkest colors she could find. If she was going to successfully sneak out of the castle and bring Sirius food at the shrieking shack, she had to look the part. Part of what? She didn’t really know.She sat at her desk, scribbling onto the parchment before her. It had taken a few rough drafts, but after an hour she was satisfied with the letter she had written back to Charlie. She made sure to keep her emotions, most of them, out of it, and kept it short and sweet. She folded up the parchment, stuck it into an envelope, scribbled Charlie’s name on the front before sealing it completely.During the past hour, she also had come up with the plan on how to get to the shrieking shack undetected. There was still a soft light across the horizon, but the sun was slowly setting. She grabbed her robes and an extra cloak, layering herself up because she was sure it would be much colder out at night without the warmth of the sun. She had charmed her bag with an invisible extension charm, ensuring the ability to gather as much food as possible to give to the murderer who escaped Azkaban.After slipping out of her room and heading towards the owlery, she sent her letter to Charlie off and soon slipped back out to head down towards the kitchens. Luckily, the corridors had been empty. It was already dark outside, and curfew was beginning in a few minutes so she knew she would be in the clear.Once she got to the kitchens, she was able to get through the portrait door, slipping in and greeting the house elves.Pippin, an energetic elf that had been there since Adelaide was a first year, ran forward. “Mistress Corden! Oh, we has missed you.”Adelaide giggled, grinning from ear to ear. “Oh Pippin! How are you? I’ve missed you, as well.” She knelt by the elf and watched them all scatter around, still cleaning up from dinner.“Can I grab a few things if it’s no trouble?” Adelaide knew they would not ask questions. All throughout her time at Hogwarts, she used to raid the kitchens after every Gryffindor quidditch match with Charlie and Tonks. Charlie would hop up onto the counters, usually still hurt from whatever quidditch affliction he had that game, and munch on some muffins while Adelaide moved around him, healing what she could with just her wand. As the elves got things together for her, Adelaide found herself smiling fondly at the memories.“Of course not. Take whatever you want!” Pippin nodded, waving at Adelaide as she walked off to finish her job.Adelaide took in a deep breath, opening her bag and started grabbing whatever she could get her hands on – at least whatever still looked edible and was untouched. She piled in muffins, cookies, a loaf of bread, and a few other things, into her bag. Grabbing what liquids she could seal with her wand, she tossed them into her bag as well before pulling the strap over her shoulder.She pulled her cloak up over her head and quickly made her way back out into the hallway. It was not long before she found herself rushing through harsh winds mixed with snowfall and trekking through the snow that had already accumulated on the ground to get to the shrieking shack. At one point she stopped walking and stood for a minute or two. What was she doing?Was she making a mistake? After all, this man was a convicted killer. She did not know much about his crimes, but she knew enough to understand that he was a dangerous man. And now knowing that he was also an animagus – well that answered a lot of questions. Like how he escaped Azkaban, for starters. He has also been undetected by the dementors. She attributed that to him consistently being in his animagus form.In her head she began fighting with herself, one side was for helping Sirius while the other was against it and wanting to turn him in. At least to Remus. He was older and wiser. He would know what to do.“Mama did not raise me to fear the unknown. I am strong. I am capable of handling this. I can do this.” She found herself saying out loud, shifting the bag on her shoulder before continuing the walk to the shack.Once inside, Adelaide had to ignore the dread seemingly seeping through every nook and cranny. Merlin, this place really was as creepy inside as it looked on the outside. Adelaide took in a deep breath and ventured up the stairs that were laid out before her, chewing on her bottom lip as she glanced around.Once upstairs, she saw a long-haired man seated on the bench of an old busted up piano. She could not help but be curious about how long all these things had been in this building. The dirt and cobwebs were making her stomach turn. She hated dirty things. All things considered, Adelaide was a bit of a clean freak.“I’m surprised you came.” The man spoke up though did not turn around as he lightly played around with the keys of the piano before him.If Adelaide had to guess, she would have thought this man would have – at one time – been able to play her a beautiful melody.“Honestly, I’m quite surprised myself.” She joked, a soft yet nervous laugh escaping her lips as she moved forward. She set the bag down and started digging through, picking out everything she had brought for him.“I’ve brought you whatever I could get my hands on. And some pumpkin juice, too. To help wash it all down.” She walked to the piano, setting some of the things down on the table beside it before turning to go back to her bag. She did not get far though, as Sirius – who she now recognized from his mugshots that were plastered everywhere in Hogsmeade – reached out and grabbed her arm.Rather than put up a fight, Adelaide closed her eyes and froze. At this point, she was just going to accept her fate. Tonks always said her good heart would get her killed one day.“Open your eyes.” Sirius whispered. His voice came out raucous. Most likely from all the screaming he did while locked away in Azkaban.Adelaide obeyed. Slowly opening her eyes, she turned herself inward to face him. Adelaide tried her best not to grimace at his appearance. He was dirty, and he looked sick.“Why?”“Why w-what?” Adelaide whispered. Her voice coming out soft and unsure. She didn’t want him to know she was frightened, but she always had a hard time hiding her emotions.“Why are you helping me? Feeding me? I’m Sirius fucking Black, darling.” He laughed a deranged laugh.“Have you always questioned when someone was nice to you, Sirius fucking Black?” She asked, raising a brow. She glanced to his dirty hand on his arm. “Please remove your hand. I do not want to have to remove it myself.”At this, Sirius found himself smirking. “As you wish.” He let go of her and moved to the food, finishing an entire muffin before picking up a scone and looking back at the blonde witch again.“But to answer your question, yes. It’s been a very long time since anyone has been nice to me.” He admitted, now sitting back down on the bench with a satisfied sigh. “The muffins are just as delicious as I remember them.”Adelaide smiled. She was not sure why, but she felt compelled to stay. To ask him more questions. To find out his story. To understand him.Sirius took a sip of the pumpkin juice and turned to face her. The striped prison pants were hanging loosely off his thin body, torn at the ends. Adelaide felt bad for him – for a moment, anyway.“Aren’t you going to tell me who you are you before we get down into the nitty gritty of it all?” He questioned.Adelaide sighed softly. “Well, I guess it’s only fair.” She continued watching him. “Adelaide Corden. I would typically say pleasure to make your acquaintance, but I’m not sure about that yet.”Sirius smiled, bowing forward. “Well, let me say it for you. The pleasure is all mine.”“Yes, well, let me get straight to it then, yeah?” Adelaide moved to sit in another, very obviously dilapidated, chair near the fireplace. A fireplace that has not been used in a very, very long time.“Why did you escape Azkaban?” Adelaide questioned, tilting her head to the side. “Actually, how did you escape is more like it. I mean, you are the first person to do so, ever.”“All it took was twelve long years of insanity and sheer will power, darling.” Sirius smirked.“Very funny.” Adelaide sighed, leaning back in the chair as she studied the frail man before her. “Next question,” She began, leaning forward and prepping her chin up in the palm of her hand. “Are you here to kill Harry Potter?”Sirius blanched, staring at Adelaide in disbelief. “No!” He exclaimed, a look of anger coming over his face now. He shot up and stared pacing. “I would never harm Harry.”“Why should I believe you?”Sirius was glaring at her now. Deep down he knew he had no right to be angry. The whole wizarding community probably thought that was what he was doing. That could not be any further from the truth, though.“I am here to kill someone. But it’s not Harry.” Sirius told her, his arms crossing tightly over his chest. “An old friend, if you will.”Now it was Adelaide’s turn to grow pale. No, no, no, no. It could not be Remus, could it? She would have to stop him now if it were. She would not let anyone harm her new friend.She stood up quickly, almost tipping over the chair she was just sitting in. “You will not lay a finger on him. Do you hear me?” The tip of her wand was not pressing into the side of his neck.Sirius stood up as well, his hands raised in the air. “We can’t possibly be speaking of the same individual, love.”“You’re not speaking of Remus?” She asked, though not letting up with her wand pressing into the side of his neck.Sirius let out a loud laugh. “Bloody hell woman, no! Dear old Lupin is a true friend of mine.”The way Sirius spoke of Remus made Adelaide think that they were still in contact and close friends. On the other hand, when she asked Remus about Sirius, she had gotten the complete opposite feeling from the professor.“How can I trust you?”Sirius sighed, his hands now hanging by his sides. They did not know one another in the slightest, how could he get her to believe him? Sirius stood in silence, trying to wrap his brain around the situation that he was in. Actually – the situation that they all were in. He was no longer alone in the fight to avenge the death of James and Lily Potter.“Are you going to answer me?” Adelaide asked again, her hand shaking just a bit as she kept the tip of her wand pressed against his flesh. She could almost feel his pulse on the other end.“I’ll tell you the name of the one I’m going to kill.” Sirius told her.“If you do that, I’ll do whatever I can to stop you. I’m no murderer, Sirius Black.”Sirius smiled, his eyes raking over her face as he saw the courage behind her eyes. She was being truthful. She was not a murderer. Only having just met her and Sirius could already see she was a right and just person. But she had no idea what this man did. How he betrayed everyone who cared for him. How he served the Dark Lord.“His name is Peter Pettigrew.”

Charlie found himself pacing his cottage, left and right, for a better half of the month of December. He had first written the letter to Adelaide when he got back from the vacation in Egypt. That was in August. He had tossed out well over three dozen drafts of said letter, which had all but taken him until December to come up with the “perfect” letter.It was short and sweet. Charlie did not want to bore her by droning on about his life – or lack thereof. Though Charlie was extremely happy with his choice of career path, he was struggling on a personal level. His only friends were the other dragonologists living on the sanctuary and the dragons that they took care of.He felt quite pathetic, really. Aside from a few romantic flings with some of the Romanian locals, Charlie found himself to be quite a bit of a hermit. He would wake up before dawn to get ready for the day. He would always be the first one awake, therefore the first one to feed the dragons. He did not mind it, of course. He felt extremely bonded with most of the dragons they had on the sanctuary.He had just gotten back from dinner in the mess hall with the others when an owl he had not seen in over two years swooped into his kitchen window. The creature was truly beautiful. Black and brown feathers, groomed to perfection.“Well, hello there Fozzy.” Charlie chuckled softly, reaching forward to pluck the letter from the owl’s beak, stroking the feathers gently. “Boy, am I glad to see you.” He whispered softly, moving to the closest cabinet, and picking up a few treats to feed the owl before sitting down at the table while Fozzy swooped right back out of the window.A sweat was starting to break out over Charlie’s forehead. His fingertips brushed against the writing on the front of the envelope. He could recognize the writing a mile away if had to. Adelaide always had the neatest, and prettiest, writing out of their group.It took Charlie a few minutes of just staring at the envelope before he gathered up the courage to tear it open and unfold the letter within. “Charlie,

Thank you for your support. Even if you are still so very far away. If I am being quite honest here, I was not going to write back. I have struggled with your decision to run off to Romania without telling me for far too long.

Happy Christmas, Charles Weasley.

Adelaide”

While her letter was quite…formal, Charlie was thrilled that she even took the time to write him back. The last thing he had ever said to her was telling her to go to bed after she said that she loved him. He was struggling with understanding where she stood on their friendship, though. While it was a good thing that she responded to him, Charlie could not help but worry that she still did not forgive him. Maybe he would try to keep the line of communication open between the two of them. Maybe that would help.

M A R C H 1994, H O G W A R T S Adelaide was quite proud of herself in terms of her matchmaking abilities. Though Remus would agree to disagree on that. With each passing Hogsmeade trip, Adelaide found herself meeting Tonks with Remus in tow.Everyone who knew Nymphadora Tonks knew that she was extremely blunt. She never tried to hide herself, or what she was feeling. She was very open with her flirting with Remus. Al though Adelaide found this to be enjoyable to watch, she was always worried because Remus would – very politely, mind you – turn Tonks down.Even with the rejection, they all remained friends, which Adelaide was glad for.She had kept up with meeting Sirius at the shrieking shack, bringing him food and drink. They were getting to know one another in the process, and Adelaide was surprised to find herself actually enjoying his company. Even when he was out of his animagus form, he still smelt like a wild dog, which she had no problem telling him.She had never spoken a word of their meetings with Remus, Tonks, or anyone else. Everything she knew about the Dark Lord, Peter Pettigrew and the Potters she had learned from Sirius. She was too afraid to ask Remus, or anyone else for that matter.They would most likely wonder why she was snooping around about something that had nothing to do with her.Charlie had also written her a handful of times since Christmas. She answered him but continued to keep things short and sweet. Tonks thought she was absolutely bonkers for doing this.“Adelaide Corden, you’re stringing this poor boy along and it’s not fair.” Tonks would tell her.“But I’m not. I’m not really writing about anything personal. He’s asking about you, about work. Asking me to keep an eye on his bloody siblings. I’m like…like a glorified nanny, or something!” Adelaide would groan, glaring at Tonks until she got the hint that she no longer wanted to talk about Charlie.The conversation would soon be history once Remus joined in. Adelaide would take her cue to leave, and rush through the crowds until she was back in her room where she could plot on how to get out of the castle to see Sirius later in the night.It did not take her long to come up with a solid plan – one that she used most of the nights she would sneak out. With a simple extension charm on her little bag, she would stock up with things from the kitchen, throw the hood of her robes up over her head and stealthily sneak out of the castle when it was dark enough to not be seen.This night in March was different, though. This night, Harry Potter had decided to take a stroll throughout the corridors with a special little map. Harry had seen a name, a very peculiar one, and did what he did best – he investigated.Adelaide was unaware of this, of course. But of all nights for Harry to get caught, and the map confiscated by Remus, it had to be the night Adelaide took a bit too long in the kitchens. She was a bit hungry herself, so she grabbed a few extra things to munch on when she spent the night with Sirius.Unbeknownst to Adelaide as she slipped along the darkened corridors, Remus had the map open, flush against his desk, eyeing her movement with curiosity. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► A P R I L 1994, R O M A N I A

The last thing Charlie needed was to sit at his kitchen table and read a letter from his parents about the dementors, Sirius Black, and Hogwarts. Those three things did not go together, or at least should not go together.He found himself wondering why Adelaide had not mentioned any of this to him. He wanted to make sure she was safe, as well as his siblings. Though his parents confirmed the latter’s safety in their letter, Charlie was still worried.He felt so out of touch in Romania. He spent his days dodging dragon fire and talons the sizes of the sword of Gryffindor. He loved it, but a part of him did miss home. And no, he did not mean the burrow, or Hogwarts. But the people. That’s what he considered home.Not bothering to respond to his parents, Charlie found himself writing to someone else. “Adelaide,

Mum and Dad have told me everything about what is going on at Hogwarts. How are you doing? Have they spotted Sirius Black again? I know you can take care of yourself, but I cannot help but find myself worried for your safety.

Please be careful.

With Love, Charlie xx”

Charlie was not sure why he felt compelled to write to her about this. He knew Adelaide better than he knew himself – though since it had been so long he was no longer so sure about that. But he knew one thing – and that was that she was not telling him everything going on at Hogwarts.  Folding up the letter and shoving it messily into an envelope, Charlie sent it on its way with the owl perched by his window. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►A P R I L 1994, H O G W A R T S

Adelaide had noticed Remus was not feeling himself, so she had decided to bring him some tea and biscuits. She had just left the courtyard where she spent some time speaking with Harry, Hermione, and Ron. They were going to speak with Hagrid to see if there was something they could do about Buckbeak. Adelaide did not want to get their hopes up, so she kept her mouth shut and wished them well.“Remus?” She called, entering the classroom slowly letting the door shut behind her as she walked as quietly as possible. She knew that sound often bothered her when she was feeling under the weather, so she knew the sound of her heel clacking against the marble floor was most likely going to bother him.She heard some movement from the room above and continued on her way. Once she followed the staircase up, she found herself leaning against the doorway to keep a better look into the room.“Remus! Merlin’s balls you look bloody awful!” She cried, rushing in now to set her things down and move closer to him.“D-Did you just say Merlin’s balls?” Remus choked out a laugh, turning to look up at the blonde witch as she towered over him, moving her hand to his clammy forehead as if to check if he had a temperature.“Yes, I did. I trust that you won’t speak a word of that to anyone.” She laughed back, shaking her head. “But truly, I’m sorry, you really do look like hell. What’s wrong?” She brushed some hair from his forehead before moving back around to the other table. She prepped some of the tea for him.“You should be in bed, you know. Not doing paperwork.” She whispered, moving back over to his side, glancing at the folded up blank parchment in front of him. It looked like a map of sorts, but she chose to not say anything about it.“Here, drink some of this. It should help.” She set the teacup before him, resting her hand on his back.“Thank you, my dear.” Remus smiled warmly to Adelaide as he watched her fuss over him. The truth was the full moon was tonight. He had been so lucky enough to have Severus brew him wolfsbane each month. He was so riled up about having found Peter’s name on the map that he was not completely aware of the fact that he did not take it.“I won’t keep pestering you, Remus. But you need to rest. If you are not feeling any better by tomorrow, come see me in the infirmary. Please? Promise me you’ll do that.”“I promise, Adelaide.”With that, Adelaide left Remus’ room and slowly started to make her way back towards the hospital wing.She had almost made it but ran into Professor Snape, who did not look thrilled to have been physically bumped by the healer.“Sorry Professor, I wasn’t watching where I was going.” She spoke softly, glancing down at her feet for a moment before looking back at the dark, greasy-haired male.“Try not to make a habit of it, Corden. Now, if you’ll excuse me.” Snape gave her a curt nod and continued on his way.Adelaide turned slightly, watching him with curious eyes. She had been prepared to be violently berated by the man not simply brushed off to the side.Merlin, she was just too nosey for her own good.

A P R I L 1994, H O G W A R T S Faustus Corden once said curiosity killed the cat. In this situation – Adelaide was most certainly the cat. Her curiosity always got the best of her. She felt compelled to follow Professor Snape, so she did. She made sure to walk as slow as possible and put as much pressure on the balls of her feet so that her heels would not click against the stone flooring of the castle. Severus looked like he was a man on a mission. The cape of his black robes bellowing high in the wind behind him as he rushed through the corridors and out onto the school grounds. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► “Why don’t we just set him free?” Harry looked out of Hagrid’s window beside the half-giant. Hermione and Ron seated inside behind them at the kitchen table.Hagrid sighed. “They’d know it was me, Harry. Then Dumbledore would get into trouble.” He shook his head, glancing down for a moment before looking back up and turning to Harry with a sad smile.“He’s coming down, ya know. Says he wants to be with me when they…well, you know.” He cleared his throat and stood a bit taller, “When it happens.”Hagrid was currently fighting back tears, turning away from the window so he could no longer look out at Buckbeak. “Great man, Dumbledore… Great man.”Hermione instantly stood up from the table as she saw Hagrid looking distraught. “We’ll stay here, too. With you.”Hagrid shook his head, “Absolutely not. D’ya think I want ya seein’ somethin’ like that?” He exclaimed, waving his hand around – most likely gesturing to the beheading of the poor Hippogriff.“But before you go,” Hagrid started towards the cabinets by the opposite wall. “Ron,” He opened up a tin and reached in to pick something up.“Scabbers!” Ron exclaimed with relief. “You’re alive! Bloody rat…” He sighed, scooping the creature into his hands as he took him from Hagrid.“I think that means you owe someone an apology, Ronald.” Hermione stood up, a set determination in her eyes.Ron turned to look at Hermione, “Right.” He scoffed, “Well, next time I see that bloody cat of yours… I’ll let him know!”Harry stood in silence watching the two bickering back and forth, his eyes a bit wide as he debated on breaking the two up.“I meant me!” Hermione spat, glaring at the redhead.At that very moment, an urn burst apart on Hagrid’s table. Sand and dirt spilled out and caused all four individuals to jump and turn to try and find the source.Hermione picked up the rock that was not on the table before, assuming it was what was used to break the urn. She took in a deep breath and looked up to Hagrid before she heard Harry double over in pain with a loud, “Ow!”“What was that?” Hagrid shifted to walk towards the window, checking to make sure Harry was not injured.Harry rubbed at the back of his head and turned to look out the window. “Uh…Hagrid?”Hagrid walked over and sighed deeply. “Ye all must go. Now!” He peered out to see the minister, Dumbledore, and the executioner walking down the hills towards them.Hermione, Harry and Ron rushed out the back door as the minister began knocking on the front.The trio rushed out, keeping as low to the ground as they could before coming to hide behind the large group of pumpkins that were off to the side of Hagrid’s hut.They were able to get back up the hill before the adults came out of the hut. Ron held tightly onto Scabbers, glancing over at Hermione warily before making eye contact with Harry. They were all upset that this was happening, but the Weasley boy knew that it was affecting Hermione much differently than them.Once the axe went down, slicing clean through Buckbeak’s neck and ending his life, Hermione gasped loudly and quickly turned into Ron’s chest. She buried her face into his shirt, soft sobs escaping her mouth as she clutched onto him with Harry huddled on the other side.The trio held tight to one another, providing comfort in a time of need. Unfortunately, though, Scabbers had other plans. The rat bit down deep on Ron’s finger, causing him to jolt and send the rat flying.“He bit me!”Once the rat landed on the ground, he went running off down the hill.“Bloody hell!” Ron cried, instantly moving to chase after his pet, whom he had only just been reunited with. He was not about to lose him again. “Scabbers!”“Ron! Ron!” Harry and Hermione both started yelling after their friend, rushing to follow the redhead until they stood before the whomping willow. The thick branches were already whipping through the air, turning at every angle and leaning side to side.Honestly, if the tree weren’t so dangerous, it would be considered beautiful. Hermione found herself, though frightened, staring at the tree in awe.“Ron, run!” Harry called, pointing to the tree behind his friend.Though Ron didn’t bother looking back. There was something far scarier than the whomping willow behind Harry and Hermione. “I-It’s the Grim! Harry, Hermione… Run!” Ron cried, his face contorting in sheer, honest fear as he started to shuffle backwards, still clutching onto Scabbers tight to his chest.Turning quickly, Harry stared down at the Grim. The dog bared its teeth, glaring towards the trio. Growls began reverberating from deep within the animal’s chest before he started galloping towards Harry and Hermione.Before either of them could blind, the animal leapt up in the air but sailed right through them. He was headed directly towards Ron. The poor redhead gulped loudly, squeezing his eyes shut as he started hollering for help.The Grim grabbed onto Ron’s leg and began running towards the base of the tree, Ron dragging alongside him – still screaming and crying for help. “Harry! Help… Harry!”“Ron! Ron, wait…” Harry and Hermione both started off to following the animal and Ron, hoping to stop him but did not make it in time. Harry dove to the ground and reached forward, his fingertips only skimming Ron’s as he was sucked into the opening of the tree roots. Scabbers was still being held tightly in Ron’s other hand.Harry and Hermione had to fight off and somehow outsmart the whomping willow. A lot of screams, bumps, and bruises later, the duo were finally able to break free and slipped beneath the tree’s roots, piling into one another before gathering their wits.“Are you ok?” Harry spoke softly, helping Hermione stand up as they both brushed themselves off.“Yes, are you?” Hermione countered her concern.Harry nodded and looked ahead with a heavy sigh.“Where do you think this leads to?” The witch asked, chewing on her bottom lip out of sheer nervousness.Harry started walking, urging Hermione to follow him with a nod. “I have a hunch… Just hoping that I’m wrong.” He admitted.Before long, they found themselves climbing up through open floorboards. Harry soon realized his hunch was right.The Shrieking Shack.Once they were both out of the hole in the floor, Hermione looked around taking everything in around them.“We’re in the Shrieking Shack, aren’t we?” She asked, reaching forward, and grabbing onto Harry’s hand. Hermione was a brave witch – but the fear of the unknown was the worst of them all.“Come on, let’s go.” Harry whispered, moving forward and letting go of Hermione’s hand as they both rushed up the stairs. Groans and grunts, seemingly from someone in a lot of pain, were coming from the room above them. “That’s probably Ron.” Hermione whispered, following close behind Harry as they entered the room.“Ron!” Hermione cried, glad to see that the boy was not hurt more than he was – or worse. “You’re ok!” She knelt beside him, placing a hand on his arm.“Where’s the dog?” Harry demanded.Ron pointed, his hand shaking out of fear. “It’s a trap, Harry. It… He’s the dog! He’s an animagus!”Harry turned slowly, looking up after each set of paw prints on the dirty floor. The set of prints stopped, and Harry could see why. He was now staring at a dirty pair of boots, attached to the gangly limbs of none other than Sirius Black. The man looked absolutely deranged.Before the convicted killer could speak, Hermione leapt forward and protected Harry with her body. “If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us, too!” She snapped, hoping she did her best at keeping confident and brave. The last thing she wanted to do was sound like she was scared – even though that was exactly what she was feeling on the inside.Sirius smirked, his dark grey eyes narrowing in on the trip. “No.” He shook his head, taking another step forward. “Only one will die tonight.”Harry could not take it any longer, he rushed forward pushing Hermione to the side. “Then that one person will be you!” He wrapped his hands around the man’s throat, struggling with him before he was able to knock him down to the floor. Harry attributed his sense of strength to the fact that Sirius was gaunt and weak.They struggled, but it did not last long. Harry had taken his wand out and pointed it at Sirius.Laughing loudly, Sirius stared up at Harry with wide, bloodshot eyes. “Are you going to kill me, Harry?” He was still laughing.Before Harry could respond, the door burst open, and Remus shouted “Expelliarmus!”Harry’s wand went flying from his grip and he glared up at his professor in anger. A look of hurt, mixed with confusion, crossed his face.“Looking rather ragged, aren’t we, Sirius?” Remus could not help but smirk, his wand remained pointed at his old friend and he stepped closer and closer.Harry, Hermione, and Ron huddled close to one another watching the scene before them unfold.“Finally,” Remus began, staring down at Sirius. “The flesh reflects the madness within.”Sirius grinned a bit, staring at Remus as his hands remained by his chest. “You would know all about the madness within, wouldn’t you, Remus?”At this, Remus smirked. His hand, the one clutching his wand, was now pointing towards the ground, and no longer directed to Sirius. The professor reached forward and grabbed Sirius’ hand, pulling him up before engaging in a tight embrace.“Bloody hell!” Ron cried, staring in shock as he watched their professor hug the blasted murderer who had ripped his leg apart.“I found him! It’s him!” Sirius cried, happy tears were brimming in his eyes as he grabbed onto Remus’ shoulders, looking up at the man.“Let’s kill him.”Hermione shot forward, “No! I trusted you!” She cried. Her anger was directed towards Remus now. “All this time,” She took another step forward, “Y-You’ve been his friend!?”Harry and Ron stayed silent, staring at what was happening before them in awe.“He’s a werewolf.” Hermione sneered, turning to face Harry and Ron now. “That’s why he’s been missing classes.”Before Remus could respond, a gasp could be heard from behind them.Standing there in the doorway was Adelaide, her wand clutching tightly in one hand while the other held onto the busted doorframe for support. She had heard Hermione’s werewolf claim.How did she not see this? How did she not put two and two together? She was shocked, but more so angry at herself. She was supposed to be smart but now she felt absolutely idiotic. She stepped forward, looking between the two old friends before looking past them towards the trio.Remus turned back to Hermione, “How long have you known?”Adelaide made eye contact with Sirius, but soon rushed forward to kneel beside Ron. “You’re hurt.” She whispered, inspecting his leg, and letting out a sigh.“It was h-him!” Ron pointed to Sirius.Adelaide turned and glared at the man. Ron, however, watched this interaction and shifted back on the sofa more. “You know him.” He said, looking at Sirius and then back to Adelaide. Adelaide sighed, “It’s a long story, Ronald. Just… try to relax right now.”Hermione stood her ground, “Since Professor Snape set the essay.” Her explanation directed towards Remus and the question he had posed.Remus chuckled. “You really are the brightest witch of your age, Hermione.”“Enough talk, Remus!” Sirius cried out, limping from side to side as he tried to take a few steps forward, closer to Ron and Adelaide.“Wait!” Remus held his arm out, stopping Sirius from moving any further.“How could you?” Ron pushed Adelaide’s hand from his knee, Scabbers still nestled tight against his chest with his other hand.“I did my waiting, Remus!” Sirius’ voice echoed loud throughout the broken room. “Twelve years of it… In Azkaban!”Adelaide stood up, bowing her head at the feeling of shame that quickly overcame her. She felt as though she had betrayed the trio. She glanced over at Remus and could see the sense of understanding behind his gaze.“Very well.” Remus shrugged nonchalantly, handing Sirius his wand. “But just wait one more minute. Harry deserves to know why.”Adelaide glanced back at Ron. Her eyes narrowed in on the rat in his arms and while Harry spoke back to Remus and Sirius about his parents’ betrayal and their death. Remus explained that they were betrayed, but that it was not Sirius.Adelaide stepped forward, grateful for the conversations she had with Sirius. She knew who it was.“I’m sorry, Ron.” She whispered, reaching forward and roughly grabbing Scabbers out of Ron’s grasp.“Peter Pettigrew!” Sirius exclaimed, a sick grin growing on his lips, his rotting, dead teeth now on full display. “And it’s our lucky night! He’s in this very room.” He turned to Adelaide and bowed towards her.“Ms. Corden,” Sirius spoke softer now, his eyes even softening as he looked to the blonde-haired witch.“Come out, come out Peter!” Sirius called, his eyes narrowing in on what Adelaide was holding in his hands.Before Adelaide could do anything, Professor Snape rushed forward and shouted, “Expelliarmus!”Remus’ wand that Sirius was wielding was now shot out from his grasp and flung across the room.Adelaide and the trio stayed silent as they watched the heated discussion between Severus, Remus, and Sirius unfold.“Now if you’ll excuse us, Remus and I have some business to attend to.” Sirius spoke towards Severus, but before he could move towards where Remus’ wand had landed, Severus had his wand pressed roughly into his neck.Adelaide wasn’t sure when it happened, but Remus and Sirius began bickering like an old married couple. Severus had said as much, his wand still digging into Sirius’ neck.“The dementor’s are longing to see you, Sirius.” Severus spat, pressing his wand down even harder. Stepping forward as Sirius stepped back, Severus smirked. “Do I detect a flicker of fear?”Adelaide, still holding tightly onto Scabbers, slipped her hand beneath her cloak and slowly grabbed a hold of her wand. She could not believe what she was about to do, but it had to be done. She would rather it be here to cast the spell than Harry. She could see him reaching for Hermione’s wand out of the corner of her eyes.“Expelliarmus!” She exclaimed, her wand pointing to Snape now, her eyes wide as he went flying and collapsed into an old bed frame. She knew he was not hurt, other than maybe a few bumps and bruises, but she still felt sick to her stomach at what she had done.“Adelaide!” Harry breathed out, nodding to her as if to thank her for doing it before he could.Sirius looked to Adelaide, almost with admiration. He was about to open his mouth to speak before Harry started asking about Peter Pettigrew.Remus explained who Peter was to them, going back and forth with Harry after Harry exclaimed about Peter’s death and Sirius being the one behind it.“How do you explain seeing his name on the map?” Remus questioned, ignoring the fact that Harry was pointing the wand directly at him now.“I- I don’t know. The map was lying then!”Sirius growled, “The map never lies!”Sirius stepped forward, walking right up to Adelaide. He smiled to her and gestured to the rat in her arms.“Pettigrew is alive, Harry.” Sirius turned to look at his godson now. “And he’s right there.” He pointed back to Adelaide and the rat she was holding onto for dear life. She wasn’t sure why he had not bitten her to get away. She was terrified that Remus and Sirius were wrong and that the rat in her hands was just Scabbers and not Peter Pettigrew.“You’re mental!” Ron exclaimed, trying to get up but Hermione kept him down. “He’s been in my family for-““Twelve years.” Sirius finished, raising a brow as he watched the confusion wash over Ron’s face.“Ron, it’s true.” Adelaide said, turning to look at the redhead with a sad smile. She held the rat up, staring at him. “He’s missing a toe.”“And all they could find of him was-“Remus began, but was cut off by Harry.“His finger.”“Yes.” Remus agreed.“Alright then.” Harry, waved the wand a bit, gesturing for Sirius to take the rat from Adelaide’s arms. “Show me.”Adelaide let Sirius take the rat from her hands as she stepped back. Sirius set him down on the piano – the same piano that he had jokingly played for Adelaide on one of their recent meetings, even though most of the keys were missing.The rat tried to run off, Remus was quick with his wand. Within a blink of an eye, the rat transformed into a grotesque looking man who got stuck in the middle of the wall as he had tried to escape.Adelaide felt sick to her stomach watching the newly transformed man try to reunite with his old friends. She glanced over at the trio, watching the sudden realization wash over them – Ron especially.Peter tried to get away, but Remus and Sirius pushed him back to the center of the room.Peter turned to look around at everyone around him before homing in on Harry.“Oh! Harry! Harry, you look so much like your father.” Peter said, his hands outstretched towards the boy who lived.“How dare you speak to Harry!” Sirius growled, stepping forward to pull Peter away.Unfortunately, Peter set his marks on Ron next. Begging Ron to save him, explaining that he had been such a good pet.Ron looked utterly disgusted, shifting back as far as possible away from the man.Peter cried for help, trying to explain to Remus and Sirius that he had no choice in selling out their best friends, James and Lily, to Voldemort.“Remus? Sirius?” Peter whined, “What would you have done, huh? What would you have done?” He was pointing at Sirius, stepping closer and closer to him.“I would have died!” Sirius cried out in anguish.Adelaide covered her mouth to try and stifle a sob. This was extremely taxing on everyone in the room, but especially on Harry. She could not imagine what he feels, listening to the man who sold his parents out to the Dark Lord.Peter tried getting away again, but Harry stepped in his path. He begged Harry to spare his life, turning back around to face Remus and Sirius as they pulled him away from the boy.Peter stumbled towards Adelaide. “Oh, Addy!” He cooed, reaching forward for the girl. “You have grown up so nicely. P-Please tell them not to kill me. I was a good pet, I was. You sued to hug me and kiss me. You were a nice girl.”Peter was now kneeling before her, his grubby hands reaching forward and pulling on her cloak. He was leaning into her legs and Sirius could feel his blood boil as he watched him.Adelaide felt her stomach churn at everything Peter was saying. Her hand covered her mouth again, mentally willing away the bile that was rising quickly in her throat.“You are foul.” She breathed out, her eyes narrowing in on the dirty man before her before she watched Sirius roughly grab him and pull him away from her.Harry stepped in. He was a good kid, Adelaide thought, watching him discuss with Remus and Sirius about how they would bring him to the castle and let the dementors have him.Adelaide brushed off her cloak, gagging a bit at the stench that Peter’s hands left behind. She looked back over to Ron, quickly rushing to his side as she helped him to his feet. Harry, Remus, and Hermione left the room first, dragging Peter along after binding him.“Here, let me…” Sirius spoke up, moving to wrap Ron’s other arm around his shoulders as they helped him down the stairs. “I’m sorry about the bite.” He told Ron, “I… Well, I was really aiming for the rat, you know.”Ron grimaced, trying to ignore the pain. “Yeah, Addy is a great healer. I’ll be good as new in no time, right Addy?”Adelaide let herself laugh softly. It was a genuine laugh as she held onto Ron’s hand, keeping his arm slung around her shoulders. “Yes, Ron. I’ll have you all patched up in no time.”The group had all made it out of the Shrieking Shack, now standing before the Whomping Willow. Everyone but Adelaide and Ron were discussing what to do with Peter.The blonde witch knelt beside Ron, ripping at his jeans to move the fabric out of the way so she could get a better look at his leg.“It’s not bad, Ronald. Just try not to scream anymore, yeah?” She teased him, ruffling his hair a bit. She had always looked at the rest of the Weasley siblings as part of her own family.She pointed her wand to the deep gash in his leg and began reciting “Vulnera Sanentur” in a soft, melodic voice. She figured it would be best to fix that wound first.The gash was beginning to close as she recited the incantation. Unfortunately, she was running out of time. Before the gash could close completely, a soft light lingered over them from above. Peeling her eyes away from Ron’s leg, she looked up and let out a gasp.“Sirius!” She cried, standing up and turning around to face the others. She could see Remus staring up at the moon, in all its full glory, finally no longer hidden by the clouds.“Remus, please! Listen to the sound of my voice.” Adelaide begged, starting to walk closer to the man.“No!” Sirius stepped between them, his hands grabbing Adelaide’s and giving her a tight squeeze. “Get them out of here.” He whispered, nodding to the trio.Remus was already beginning to transform. His cries of pain were loud, echoing in the dark night as he doubled over in pain.“Run!”   

“You heard the man, move it!”Adelaide let go of Sirius’ hands as he moved to Remus’ side. She turned and rushed to the trio, bending down to help Ron up.“We have to get out of here. Now!” She hissed, nodding to Hermione as a thank you for helping her lift Ron up and provide support.Hermione looked over at Peter, “What about Peter Pettigrew? What can we do- Oh!”Adelaide turned and watched the filthy man wiggle his fingers in a wave, quickly taking advantage of the situation and transforming into his animagus form and scurrying away.“Remus!” Harry moved towards the older men, looking to provide support – or something, Adelaide had no idea what he was thinking.“Harry, no!” Adelaide let go of Ron and rushed forward to grab a hold of his arm, trying to pull him back. She was not that strong, but she did her best to nudge him back into Hermione’s grip.She turned in time to see Sirius, in his animagus form, lunge towards Remus, who was now completely transitioned into a werewolf. She tried her best to not show fear, especially for the sake of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. She needed to protect them.Remus had roughly thrown Sirius out of the way, slowly creeping towards Adelaide and the trio.She turned around, spreading her arms out and pressing back into the three of them, “Move back.” She hissed, trying to get them out of view of the wolf.She was wracking her brain around what she had learned about werewolves.She knew one thing, which may be the most important factor. Remus did not know who he was. He was no longer Remus J. Lupin – he was just another werewolf. A blood-thirsty creature that would kill even their best friend and not think twice. Not even think at all. Adelaide could not imagine the torture Remus went through with each passing full moon. She did not know his story. She did not know how long he had suffered from his lycanthropy. Maybe one day she would find out. Maybe one day he would feel comfortable enough to tell her.“He must not have taken his potion.” Adelaide whispered, more so to herself than to the others. She straightened her back, trying to stand as tall as possible as she stared up and over at the werewolf. A small sob escaped her lips as she made eye contact with him. His eyes, she was surprised, remained to be more human-like than the eyes of a true wolf.Remus stood tall, freakishly tall really, and started towards Adelaide.“Run!” She cried over her shoulder at the trio, glancing quickly before turning back just in time to be met face-to-face with the wolf.His breath was foul, and the saliva was dripping from his sharp teeth as his mouth hung open.She tripped backwards, though was able to remain standing. A loud growl distracted Remus, and before Adelaide could blink, Sirius bounded forward and tackled Remus. This gave Adelaide the chance to turn and grab Harry’s arm. “Let’s go! It’s not safe out here!”Hermione nodded in agreement but froze as she watched Harry pull himself from Adelaide’s grip. He rushed towards the cliff at hearing a whine of pain coming from Sirius. “He needs my help!” Harry continued rushing forward. Adelaide had a feeling that he would not change his mind.“Fuck, Harry…” Adelaide groaned, turning to run after him but Hermione spoke up first. “Go. Take Ron back to the castle. I’ll go with him.” Hermione shifted Ron’s body into Adelaide’s before rushing off after Harry.“I don’t feel too good, Addy.” Ron groaned, leaning his head off to the side before Adelaide hiked him up against her side. She slung his arm around her shoulders and started to make her way back towards the castle. It was hard to concentrate. The sky was extremely dark, and the wind whispered around them as they limped towards the courtyard. Adelaide tried to ignore the chill that ran down her spine at the distant howling.Even though Adelaide knew the howling was not close by, and that right now they were safe, she could not help but force her legs to move just a little bit faster to get into the castle.Blasted Hogwarts and not letting apparition on the school grounds, Adelaide thought to herself as she hobbled along the dark and empty corridor. She had just about made it to the hospital wing before she started calling out for Madam Pomfrey. She could not bear to be quiet for much longer.“My word!” Poppy exclaimed, still rubbing the slumber from her eyes as she rushed out of her room to help lay Ron down in the closest empty bed.“What happened?” She whispered to Adelaide, who was as pale as a ghost.“We must get Dumbledore. Right away.” Adelaide told her, moving to pull out her wand from beneath her cloak before getting started on healing Ron’s leg. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► “You’ll be good as new before you know it, Ron.” Adelaide gently brushed some hair from his forehead as she glanced down at Harry and Hermione with a nod. She could hear heavy, but at the same time light as a feather, footsteps nearing the hospital wing.“That must be Dumbledore.” She sighed, rubbing at her eyes. She had only slept for a total of two hours and was completely exhausted. She needed – no, wanted – to make sure Remus was ok. And Sirius… she needed to see him. She needed Dumbledore to tell her where they were keeping him.She tucked her wand into the back pocket of the jeans she had changed into and bid farewell to the trio as she rushed through the doors. She was luckily able to stop herself before a head on collision with the headmaster himself.“Ah. Ms. Corden.” Dumbledore smiled knowingly down at the young healer. His smile was mischievous, really. It usually was. Adelaide assumed it was because he really was always up to something.He tapped the end of his nose with the tip of his finger as he bowed to her. “Just the witch I was looking for.” He spoke softly, glancing around before looking back down to Adelaide.“Listen, Professor, if this… if this is about Professor Snape…” Adelaide had almost forgotten about what she did just a few hours ago. She felt sick to her stomach and had hoped that her actions would not affect her future as a healer.Dumbledore shook his head. A giggle even escaped between his lips as he reached forward and pressed his hand against the side of Adelaide’s face. The gesture was quite paternal, and it made Adelaide miss her father. She had not spoken to either of her parents since Christmas. They would probably be upset that so much has happened involving their little girl that she kept hidden from them.“My dear girl,” Dumbledore began. “Do not fret about Severus Snape. He is doing just fine.” He told her, removing his hand from the side of her face to come up to his own face, stroking his beard a bit.“Then, what is it you wanted to speak to me about?” Adelaide tilted her head to the side and looked up at the man before her.“You’ll find your answer at the top of the dark tower.”Dumbledore smiled and stepped around Adelaide as he shuffled his way into the hospital wing. Most likely to speak with the trio.Standing there for a moment or two after Dumbledore had walked away, Adelaide was not sure what to do with herself. Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard she had ever known. Was he really somehow all-knowing? Did he know who she was looking for?“Here goes nothing.” She whispered to herself, tucking strands of hair behind her ears as she started off towards the location Dumbledore had just provided her.The castle was alive again, but Adelaide found herself tuning out everyone and everything around her. She was not paying too much attention to where she was going, like her feet had a mind of their own. She would always know the castle like the back of her hand.Once she got up the stairs, she tried to ignore the winded feeling she had. She really was out of shape and was glad nobody else was around to witness her struggle to catch her breath.“Sirius?” She whispered, moving out of the doorway, and quickly walked towards the metal bars of the cell door before her.“Hello love. How did you find me?”“Dumbledore.” She answered with a laugh. “If you have to ask, the answer is probably always going to be Dumbledore.”Sirius groaned a bit as he shifted in his position on the ground. He pulled himself all the way up from laying on his back and was now seated with his back against the wall for support. Turning to face the door, Sirius forced a smile when Adelaide came into view.The blonde quickly knelt by the door, grasping onto the bars as she leaned forward to get a better look at the prisoner.“Sirius, I am so sorry.” She whispered. She started chewing on her lower lip, lowering her gaze to the ground between them.Almost having his entire soul sucked from his body last night had done quite a number on Sirius Black. But he mustered up what strength he could and crawled over to the door. He reached forward and grasped the same bar as Adelaide, letting his fingers run against her soft skin.Adelaide sucked in a deep breath at the contact, once again ignoring that his hands were extremely dirty. She chose to forgo such trivial details but not until she cracked a joke, “I dreamt about what you would look like when you were all cleaned up. I wish we had time for that.” A soft laugh escaped her lips and she smiled up at him.“Darling, I don’t think your young heart could handle it.” He teased back, a laugh escaping his lips as he held onto her hand.“I am sorry, though. Sorry that you’re sitting in here… Sorry that Peter got away.”Sirius sighed and shook his head. “Nonsense. Those are both things that you don’t need to apologize for.”Adelaide smiled sadly, shifting to now let go of the bars and just lean her head against them. Her feet curled up beneath her and she started playing with the bottom hem of her shirt. “I could break you out of here. I can help you run.” She looked over at him.Sirius shook his head. “I won’t ask that of you. You have your whole life ahead of you, Adelaide Corden. You don’t need to go down with the sinking ship.” He leaned against the inside of the door, watching her intently.“Let’s not talk about things we cannot change. Tell me about yourself. More than what you already have.” Sirius told her with a small smile. He wanted to take his mind off of what was in store for him.“It’s all quite boring really, Sirius. I’m training to be a healer. I’ll be official in June.” She shrugged, still playing with the hem of her shirt. She had to fidget with something whenever she was nervous, or sad.“What about the Weasleys?”She stopped playing with her shirt and looked up at him. “What about them?”“Well, Peter mentioned about how much you’ve grown. You must have spent a lot of time with the Weasleys.” Sirius mentioned innocently.Adelaide sighed softly and nodded. “Charlie.” She smiled sadly. Sirius was a dead man – she really did not want to talk about this but the least she could do was humor him.“Ah. Your beau?”Adelaide laughed. She rolled her bright blue eyes and looked over at Sirius. “No, Sirius. Not my beau. My best friend. All throughout school. I spent every bloody summer at the Burrow.” She paused, “It’s what they call their home, the Weasleys.” She explained, a smile still lingering on her lips as she thought about all the good times she spent with Charlie and his siblings.“Ron’s a good kid. Harry is lucky to have the Weasleys’ in his corner, Sirius. I can promise you that much.”Sirius nodded. “Good. Good. Promise me you’ll keep an eye on him, though? If you can. Maybe ask Remus… once I’m gone, that is.”“You have my word, Sirius.” She told him, glancing around for a moment. She caught the sun starting to rise higher in the sky. It was crazy that she felt such a connection to this man. They barely knew one another, other than quick late-night meetings in the Shrieking Shack. Most of which were just her dumping food out for him, telling him that he smelled bad, and then leaving.The last few times they had met were nice, though. They talked about their lives. She learned about Regulus and the rest of the noble and ancient house of Black. Sirius had made the joke that, since Adelaide was a pure blood, that they may be related to one another.That one she did not find too funny. But she humored him in calling him Uncle Sirius. He did not like that much. Thinking back on all of this just made he feel worse about the events of last night.“You should get going. They’ll be coming at any moment to take me away. I don’t want you getting caught up in any of this.” Sirius reached forward now. His wrist was thin enough that he was able to fit his hand through the bars.She didn’t pull away from him. Letting his hand rest on the side of her face as she leaned as close to him as she could.She did not want to leave him just yet. 

Leaving Sirius was a lot harder than Adelaide could have ever imagined. They said goodbye in silence. There were so many things she wanted to learn about him, about Remus and the rest of the Marauders. Longing glances between the cell door were all that they had in the short amount of time they were given. Hands clutching the metal tightly was as close as they were able to get to one another.Adelaide refused to let Sirius see the tears accumulating in her eyes. She made sure to keep her head bowed low and her eyes squeezed shut. It was not until she was walking back down the staircase within the castle did the tears flow down her cheeks.A part of her felt like she was betraying someone. Charlie, maybe. Even though she has barely spoken to him, let alone the fact that she had not seen him since their last night as students in Hogwarts. She felt almost embarrassed about the connection she felt with Sirius Black. The man was much older than her, but not quite old enough to be her father (thank Merlin for that).Each night she would spend sneaking out to him at the Shrieking Shack, she felt a rush of adrenaline and danger. Again, she felt embarrassed. It was a turn on. The excitement of danger, maybe even of being caught. She had no idea what had come over her. She was never this adventurous when she was younger. If only Charlie could see her now…Actually, scratch that thought. Adelaide did not want Charlie to see her now. No, definitely not. Here she was crying over another man. But not just any man. Sirius Fucking Black. An innocent man who was going to lose his life for the crimes that a supposed friend had committed and framed him for. That was something she still could not understand. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► J U N E 1994, H O G W A R T S“I still can’t believe you’re leaving.” Adelaide sighed, folding a pair of trousers for Remus, much to his dismay. He refused her help countless times since everything with Peter and Sirius happened. Remus had been avoiding her since that night and Adelaide could not understand why. All she wanted to do was help him.Since that night, Adelaide had kept a close eye on the trio. Hermione had provided all the details of what happened with the time turner. About Sirius’ escape with Buckbeak. Adelaide felt the tips of her fingers tingle when she thought of Sirius living as a free man. But she knew he would not be a free man, at least not yet. Not until Peter Pettigrew was captured.“Well, it is what’s best, Adelaide.” Remus told her, a sad smile forming on his lips as he watched her fold a few more articles of clothing for him. He thanked her and closed the suitcase before moving back to his desk.“Will you at least stay in touch?” She asked hopefully, moving to look at a few more things around the room. “Tonks will most certainly be asking about you. I think she’s got a schoolgirl crush on you.” Adelaide smirked, looking over at Remus with a chuckle.“Of course, we’ll stay in touch.” Remus told her with a nod. Fingertips tapped against the blank Marauder’s Map that lay out in front of him on his desk. He made a mental note to get the map back into Harry’s hands. It was only fair that it remains with someone in the family – Harry was, after all, the son of James ‘Prongs’ Potter.Remus could not help but blush at the mention of Tonks. To be fair, he had a bit of a crush on her as well. He was far too old to be having ‘crushes’, though. He was too old, too poor, too dangerous to spend his life with someone.“Well, while we’re on the subject of crushes, Ms. Corden…” He trailed off, peering up at her from the map with a smirk.“What?” She asked, doing her best to act confused about what he was speaking about. She knew exactly what, though. She just chose to deny it.“A certain shaggy dog caught your eye?”“Absolutely not!” She guffawed, glaring over at Remus before she heard the shuffle of two feet that were not her own, nor belonged to Remus.“Harry!” She smiled over at the dark-haired boy before moving over to the table. “I’ll leave you two be. Remus, I’ll catch up with you before the end of the day.”“Thanks Addy.” Harry smiled before turning to look at Remus. Adelaide could tell that Harry was angry that Remus was leaving. She, of course, did not blame him.  ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► J U N E – A U G U S T 1994, R O M A N I A “Addy,

When the bloody hell were you going to tell me about Sirius Black?

Xx, Charlie”

An angry letter was the least of Adelaide’s concerns, Charlie knew that much. But after speaking with his father about what went down at Hogwarts, Charlie was a ticking timebomb. The Adelaide he knew would have never gotten involved in the things that she did. How can one person change that much in just under two years? “Charles,

I’m afraid I have been too busy to tell you what has been going on. If it makes you feel any better, I didn’t tell Tonks, either.

Yours Truly,

Adelaide”

Charlie rolled his eyes, staring at the letter in his hands. That was all she could say? Knowing that she also did not tell Tonks about her scheme to help Sirius Black did not make him feel any better. She had put herself in harms way and for what? For a man. A man she didn’t know. A man, whom until recently, the public believed to be a mass murderer. What in Merlin’s balls was Adelaide thinking? “Adelaide,

Father tells me you’re starting work at St. Mungos. Will you get time off? Look at this letter as my official invitation to come stay with me for a few days. Maybe in a few weeks time?

I miss you.

Yours,

Charlie”

“Charles ,

I’ve only just started this job. It’s not proper etiquette to request vacation so soon. Maybe next summer.

Yours Truly,

Adelaide”

“Trouble in paradise, eh, Weasley?” Hugo peered over the redhead’s shoulder, grinning as he read the letter.“Hugo!” Charlie groaned, snatching the letter up from the table and holding it to his chest. “Last I checked I didn’t invite you over to read through my mail.” He glared up at the man. Hugo was his boss, but also his friend. One of his closest here on the sanctuary.“There is no paradise for there to be trouble in, Hugo. You know that already.” Charlie sighed, crumbling the letter up and tossing it aside. He didn’t know what else to say to Adelaide. He could tell by her correspondence that she had very little interest in coming to see him, or even remaining in contact with him. They had traded weekly letters with one another for three months.“Well, cheer up buttercup.” Hugo nudged his friend roughly. “I’ve got good news.”“Good news?” Charlie looked over at Hugo curiously.“Heard from old Dumbledore earlier this morning. Something big is coming to Hogwarts. They need dragons.”“What do you mean they need bloody dragons?” Charlie shot up, his hands pressing firmly against the table as he stared down his boss.“You need to promise not to tell anyone. They’re not announcing this until a few weeks into the school year.” Hugo began, a look of amusement crossing over his face as he watched Charlie try to figure out what he could be talking about.“Yeah, yeah. You have my word.” Charlie nodded enthusiastically, sitting quite literally on the edge of his seat as he waited for Hugo to tell him what the good news was.“Hogwarts is hosting the Triwizard Tournament.” Hugo continued with the explanation of the tournament. The men were already arguing about what school would win. Charlie obviously had his vote on Hogwarts, but since Hugo attended Durmstrang Institute, he had all bets on them taking the win. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►N O V E M B E R 1994, H O G W A R T S

Looking up at the castle brought chills to Charlie. Sucking in a deep breath, he glanced over at Hugo with a smirk before he ventured off to find his siblings before the first task began. The last few letters he had sent to Adelaide went unanswered.Maybe he took it too far with asking her to come stay with him. He was curious if she had read his latest letter. If she did, she would know he was there at Hogwarts for the tournament. At least for the first task.He spent a few minutes talking with the twins and Ron, getting to know about Harry and how he had been chosen, making an extra champion for Hogwarts and entire tournament itself.“Can you make sure Harry gets the least likely to kill him dragon?” Ron gulped.Charlie let out a laugh, his hands reaching up to grab his youngest brother’s shoulders and give him a gentle squeeze.“I’ve watched these dragons grow up, Ron. They’re not evil, or anything, but they can certainly do some damage. Especially Lucy. She’s the Hungarian Horntail.”Ron groaned. “Well, with Harry’s lucky, that’s the one he’ll get!” He muttered, crossing his arms over his chest with a deep sigh.The siblings separated when Charlie’s name was being called by Hugo – signaling that the first task was about to begin.“I’ll catch up with you lot later!” Charlie called over his shoulder as he rushed along through the crowd of eager students who were fighting to get good seats in the arena to watch the task. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► D E C E M B E R 1994, 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE

“Remus, have you returned any of Tonks letters?” Adelaide tucked her hands deeper within the pockets of her cloak, and as she continued walking the cobblestone streets of London, she glanced up at her newest confidant with a frown.“Uh,” Remus sighed, blowing breath into his hands before rubbing them together. “Not all of them, no.” He admitted sheepishly.The two were going to grab a bite to eat since it had been a while since the last time they saw each other in person. She had asked him where Sirius was hiding out at, but Remus was being too hush-hush for Adelaide’s liking.“I’m too old and poor for her, Addy.” Remus continued, his hands tucking into his pockets as they kept walking.Remus had met Adelaide outside of St. Mungos when her shift at the hospital was finished. Remus had promised her a nice, hot meal but was keeping the location a secret.“Don’t say that Remus. You cannot be afraid of love. Or… at least afraid of something that can turn into love.”The witch could not help but be a hopeless romantic. Even though her relationship with Charlie did not work out (or even start, really), Adelaide knew there was someone out there for her. Someone that she could spend the rest of her life with. Someone who would appreciate all her flaws. Someone who would love the way she always…always drooled in her sleep. Or the way that she could read an entire large text under four hours.Remus sighed, shaking his head. “Let’s not talk about me right now.” He told her. “How is work?”Adelaide smiled. “It’s wonderful, really. I hate to admit that Mum was right, but I do make a really good healer.” She laughed, reaching up to brush some hair from her eyes as the wind whipped viciously around them. As she continued to follow Remus down the street, Adelaide began to realize that she had no idea where he was taking her.“Where are we going for dinner, Rem?” She spoke up, glancing around as the street started to become a bit more residential. “I’ve never been this way in London before.” Something for a bit off with the street, or maybe that was just her. Ever since that night in April with Peter Pettigrew, she had become increasingly afraid of rats. If she ever saw something scurrying about, her mind would instantly go to Peter. She just wished they would catch the rat bastard already.“It’s a surprise. Now hush.” Remus glanced over at her with a smile.He stopped walking after another few minutes, gently taking Adelaide’s elbow in his hand.“Hey, wait where is number twelve?” Adelaide raised a brow, looking up at the homes before them. To her left was number eleven Grimmauld Place, and to her right was number thirteen.“Right…here.” Remus stepped closer by another foot or two and before Adelaide could blink, the space between eleven and thirteen grew and there, standing in all its grim glory was number twelve Grimmauld Place.“Wow.” She laughed, moving to hold onto Remus’ arm as he brought her through the gate, grimacing at the loud screech the rusted metal gave off.Once through the front door, Adelaide started unbuttoning her coat, and jumped with a loud screech when a weathered house elf walked out from the first sitting room.“Nothing but half blood, mudblood, blood traitors in this house. Misses would not be happy.” The elf complained, glaring up at Adelaide for a moment before sneering up at Remus.“Oh, uh… Hello.” Adelaide bowed a bit to the elf.“That’s Kreacher.” Remus spoke up from behind her, “And he’s not needed tonight. He’ll be on his way.” The older man glared down at the elf, who glared right back before continuing his way up the dirty, old staircase.Adelaide hated to think that someone, someone like Remus, was living here. It didn’t look like it had been lived in a very long time.“Remus?” She spoke up, unraveling the scarf from her neck as she hung it over her arm along with her coat. “Is this your home?”“Oh, goodness no.” Remus laughed, shaking his head. “It’s a close friends family home. Well, I guess now it’s his since he is the only one left.”Adelaide quirked a brow. Who else was Remus friends with that came from this kind of money? She continued walking through the corridor, looking up along the walls to see that the large portraits had been covered by thick blankets and sheets. She had never seen anyone do that before. She had always wanted to see and hear from the portraits of her lost loved ones. She never had something this grand, though. Her grandmother, Eleanor, did. But she was someone who Adelaide barely spoke to. She, unfortunately, did not see eye-to-eye with her son, Faustus, about a few very important wizarding beliefs.“Which friend?” Adelaide questioned, glancing over her shoulder at Remus with a smile. “I hope he isn’t a five-star chef cooking in a place like this.” She teased.“Sorry, love, but you won’t be finding a five-star chef in this dump.”At the sudden intrusion of a new voice, Adelaide jumped and spun around. Standing before her, a man with clean and styled long brown hair leaned himself against the doorframe with a large smile on his face. His clothes were proper, clean and although a bit outdated, they were in extremely great condition. The top few buttons of his shirt were unbuttoned, and Adelaide could spot the tattoos and small bit of chest hair peeking out from below.It was like the wind got knocked out of her. She was not expecting this. She turned to look at Remus, her eyes starting to water, before she spun back around and launched herself into the man’s arms.“Sirius!” 

D E C E M B E R 1994, 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE

Adelaide sat on the sofa, across from Sirius, her eyes still blown wide. She could not believe she was in his presence. In all honesty, the healer thought she may never see him again. Her eyes flitted to Remus, who had this pompous, proud grin on his face.“This is where you grew up?” Adelaide turned her attention back to Sirius, a small smile appearing on her lips.“Yes, for the first sixteen years of my life.” He brought the tumbler up to his lips, full to the rim with brandy, before taking a small sip. Sighing happily from the pleasure the brandy was bringing him, Sirius leaned back to get comfortable. He could see the wheels turning in Adelaide’s head. She had so many questions. She looked quite adorable when she was thinking so hard – Sirius would do his best to answer all her questions.“Where did you go after you turned sixteen?” She questioned, taking a sip of her own glass of brandy. Her nose crinkled at the bitter, burning sensation running down her throat. She made the decision long ago to stick with butterbeer and butterbeer alone. It was the safest option for her.“I moved in with Harry’s father James, and his parents, Euphemia and Fleamont. They were truly my real family.” Sirius smiled sadly, looking over at Remus who was standing by the bar counter, checking his pocket watch.“Have somewhere to be, Moony?”Adelaide looked up at hearing the nickname, “Moony?” She repeated, shaking her head. “Merlin, that is such an obvious nickname!” She teased, a giggle escaping her lips as she took another, this time larger, sip of brandy. She sat the glass down and turned a bit, looking up at Remus as he closed the distance between them all.“Actually, yes. I told Tonks that I would meet her for dinner.” The tips of his ears were bright red, though luckily for him the messy ends of his hair covered. “I thought, well why not, it’s Christmas tomorrow.” He explained with a shrug.Adelaide gasped, “You are a filthy liar, Remus Lupin!” She exclaimed, pointing up at him before leaning over and stabbing his side with her finger.“Pardon me, Ms. Corden, but I haven’t a clue what you mean!” Remus laughed softly, waving his hand at her trying to move her finger away from his side. He glanced to Sirius with a nod.“Enjoy dinner, you two. Don’t drink too much, Sirius. I’ll be back in a bit.” Remus chose to leave out the front door. Sirius still had not been successful in attaching his fireplace to the floo network, so the only available mode of transportation to and from number twelve Grimmauld Place was to apparate further out and walk.Once Remus was gone, Sirius took his cue to bring Adelaide into one of the dining areas. This was the only room he attempted to clean up as best as he could. He knew how obsessive Adelaide was with cleanliness, it was one of her many quirks that he found himself smiling about whenever he was alone.Sirius had spent twelve, lonely years in Azkaban. He never thought there would be something, nor someone, to look forward to. He had begged Remus to bring Adelaide by. He wanted to see her, to spend time with her. Not to mention he was going mad, all over again, being locked up in this house with nowhere to go and nobody to see.Dinner was simple, but delicious. Chicken, potatoes, and string beans. Adelaide lit up when Sirius made her plate for her and set it before her.“How did you know string beans were my favorite?” She asked with a grin, plucking one piece up to bite into half of it, licking her lips from the leftover butter that they had been cooked in.“I didn’t.” He admitted, shaking his head as he started digging into his plate now. “But now I do, so I’ll make sure whenever you are here there’s enough string beans to go around.” He teased, sipping at the brandy again before leaning back in his chair.They had both eaten fairly quickly and while dinner was digesting, they found themselves seated next to one another in a loveseat in the sitting room.“It’s so gloomy here, Sirius.” Adelaide sighed, looking around the dark and dusty room before letting her eyes settle on his face. “How are you holding up?”Sirius shrugged, shifting to stretch his arms out across the back of the seat, one arm brushing against her shoulders as he did so. “I’m surviving. One day at a time. Remus has been quite helpful in providing some company.”Adelaide smiled sadly. She reached over and slipped her hand onto his knee. She gave him a tight squeeze before trailing her hand further up onto his thigh to squeeze again. She pulled back and stood up.“Can I get a tour?”Sirius’ cheeks warmed up at Adelaide’s touch. He shook his head for a moment, shaking the few dirty thoughts that ran through his mind, before standing up.“Of course, love. Follow me.” He grinned, offering his arm for her to take as he started towards the staircase to head upstairs.Sirius was far too old to get nervous and embarrassed by the touch of a woman. It had been quite some time since he had felt the touch of a woman, though, and having Adelaide so close to him was certainly awakening the beast within.He took her around to each room that held at least some kind of significance to him, or the house itself. They had walked by the music room and instantly Adelaide let go of his elbow and brushed past him to walk inside.“This piano is gorgeous.” She told him, pulling her wand out and whispering a few cleaning spells to gather and banish the dust and cobwebs.“Do you play?” Sirius leaned against the doorway, watching her with a smile.Adelaide chuckled, nodding over to him as she tucked her wand back into her pocket before sitting down on the bench before the grand piano. “Of course. I am a pureblood witch, Mr. Black.” She teased, glancing over her shoulder at him, shooting him a quick wink before she turned back around and started testing out the keys. “It’s been a few years. I don’t think I’ve truly played since I moved out of my parents’ home.” She admitted, “So I may be a little bit rusty.”She began playing a soft melody. Surprising to Sirius, she was playing Federic Chopin. Thanks to Remus, Sirius knew that this composer was a muggle. Maybe times had changed since Sirius was growing up. He was strictly taught music created by magical composers. If he dared play anything created by a muggle, talented or not, he would have most likely suffered the consequences from ol’ Walburga Black.“Rusty?” Sirius repeated, standing up now and walking over to her. He took a seat beside her on the bench, his thigh completely pressing against hers as he watched her thin fingers move with ease. “You play beautifully, Adelaide.” Sirius spoke softly, his eyes remaining on her fingers as they continued dancing across the ivory keys before them.“You know Chopin?” Adelaide stopped playing, though kept her fingertips on the piano as she turned to look up at Sirius. She studied his face from the side, the damage she had witnessed last year was no longer apparent on his face. He looked healthy and albeit a bit sad, Adelaide could still see the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes when he had a genuine smile.“Remus schooled me in all things classical music when we were kids.” Sirius reached forward and began playing a little something, though messed up a few notes in before removing his hands and letting them fall to his lap. “I was too much of a badass to truly pay attention in my lessons.” He teased, glancing over at Adelaide. She was already watching him, and he found himself blushing under her gaze. It was foolish, really. He found himself understanding how Remus felt about Tonks – who was his actual bloody cousin, mind you.“This one is my favorite to play. There’s something so romantic about it… About most classical music, really. Father taught me everything he knew. Originally I had no interest in learning.” Adelaide laughed softly, glancing back to the piano with a soft sigh. “But I wanted him to be proud of me. I didn’t have any hobbies. I was smart, but I didn’t want studying to be the only thing I could be good at.” She chewed on her lower lip for a moment.“Here, let me show you.” Adelaide stood up and nudged Sirius to sit a bit closer to the edge of the bench. She stood behind him, resting her hands on his shoulders for a moment before she knelt one knee on the back of the bench before she leaned down and ran his hands along his arms until she reached his hands.“Relax.” She whispered to him, doing her best to ignore the fluttering of her heart deep within her chest.Sirius froze up immediately at the intimate position they were in. Her perfect, supply breasts were pressing into his upper back as she leaned against him, her hands finding his on the ivory keys of the piano. Sirius closed his eyes and tried to ignore the feeling of her body up against his. The heat from her breath ghosting across his neck as she leaned down to him.“I am relaxed!” He complained, a laugh escaping his lips as she pressed a bit harder against him, grabbing his hands and pulling them off the keys.“No, you’re not! Your fingers are stiff as a board! Relax!” She giggled, pulling at his fingers to try and loosen them up. “How am I supposed to teach you if you won’t help me?” She teased, turning her head a bit to look down at him with her lips turned up in a smirk.Sirius kept his head forward, letting her play with his fingers as she loosened up the joints before placing them back on the keys.“Ok, now, here,” She leaned further in, slipping her hands beneath his. His hands were much larger than hers, but she would make this work. “Keep them loose but keep them over mine.” She instructed him, her hair was tied back behind her face a braid, but the shorter strands had escaped the plait and were hanging down tickling the side of Sirius’ face and neck.Sirius followed her instructions, keeping his hands over hers, keeping the joint lose but made sure to have each of his fingers hovering over hers as his fingertips pressed a bit further into her own.Adelaide began moving her fingertips, going a bit slower than normal to make sure his fingers would follow suit.“Nocturne in E-flat major,” She whispered, continuing to move her fingertips to play the melody. “My favorite.”Sirius followed her movements, trying to keep the rest of his body completely still as she continued playing. He thought maybe he was thinking too much with the wrong head, but all he could think about was how amazing her body felt pressed against his.“Adelaide?” Sirius basically croaked, his fingers now wrapping around hers to pull them up from the keys, halting the beautiful melody ringing out within the four walls surrounding them.“Yes?” The blonde breathed out, gasping softly at the tight grasp Sirius held on her hands.“I want to thank you.”Adelaide quirked a brow, attempting to pull her hands from his before sitting down beside him again, this time facing the opposite direction. “For what, Sirius?”“For believing in me when nobody else did.” The older man turned to face her, his hands reaching up to gently cup her face. “You have shown me kindness that I haven’t seen in a very long time.” He leaned forward and gently let the tip of his nose nuzzle against hers before he pressed his lips against hers. It was a quick kiss, as he pulled right back to look down into her eyes.Adelaide froze. She wasn’t sure what the right move next should be. Her eyes remained shut as she felt Sirius rest his forehead against hers. There was a part deep down within her that knew she should not try to explore anything romantic with him. He was older, for starters. He was also on the run, hiding from the ministry because he was still believed to be a mass murderer.What on earth would she say to her parents? “Hey Mum and Dad, this is my boyfriend, convicted mass murderer Sirius Black! Oh! Did I mention he is closer to you in age than he is with me?” Letting out a soft sigh, Adelaide opened her eyes to find dark gray ones staring back down at her.“I’m sorry. Was that too much?” He whispered, though he did not bother pulling away from her. His thumbs brushed against the soft skin of her cheeks, keeping his forehead against hers.“No, No.” She shook her head, a soft giggle escaping her lips as she pulled back and pressed her fingertips against her lips. “I’m sorry. Just took me by surprise is all.” She told him, a smile forming on her lips as she looked up at him.“Let’s finish that tour?”Adelaide nodded, reaching up to take his outstretched hand before following him out of the music room.It had taken Sirius about a full hour to guide Adelaide around his ancestral home, explaining the little things still sitting on shelves or hanging on the walls. He purposely left out the family tree room, ensuring that the door remained shut as they passed by. Remus was still out at dinner, and Sirius brought Adelaide back down to the sitting room to gather her scarf, coat and gloves.“I wish I could take you home.” Sirius muttered, standing by the railing as he watched the healer wrap the red woolen scarf around her neck. It bothered Sirius to no end to know that he may never be able to be free. Free with Adelaide. Free with his friends and loved ones.“It’s ok, Sirius.” The blonde finished buttoning her jacket and stepped up to press her lips against his cheek. Her nose crinkled at the roughness of his facial hair brushing against her face. “I’m just walking a few steps and using apparition to get home. I will be perfectly safe.” She told him, a smile forming on her lips as she pat his cheek playfully.“It’s the thought that counts, right?” He chuckled, walking her towards the front door. He stopped short, though, not wanting to risk being seen incase there was anyone out on the street. Though he doubted there would be anyone out at this time of night, he had to be cautious or else Remus would have his head.“Well,” Adelaide cleared her throat and brushed a few of the fly away strands from her eyes as she looked up at Sirius. “If it’s ok with you, I’ll come back tomorrow.”Sirius shook his head, “Love, tomorrow is Christmas.” He ran his fingers through his hair, pulling the tresses out of his face and behind his ears. “You should spend time with your family.” The last thing Sirius wanted was for Adelaide to miss out on spending time with her loved ones because she felt pity for him spending Christmas alone.“Sirius.” Adelaide sighed, rubbing at her temples a bit out of frustration. “Stop.” She looked up at him, a hint of sadness in her ears. She did not want him to feel like a burden. A part of her was annoyed that he would feel such a way. “You are not a burden. And besides, my parents fall asleep right after dinner, so the night usually ends with me drinking alone in my old bedroom because I’m too drunk to get home by myself.”Sirius smiled, enjoying the mental picture Adelaide was painting of her Christmas holiday. “Well, can’t have you drinking alone now, can we?”Adelaide shook her head with a giggle. “No!” She leaned up and wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing herself into his chest for a hug. “I’ll bring you some dinner. It’ll be just like old times. Except now, you smell much nicer and don’t look like a crazed lunatic.” She teased, her face nuzzling into the crook of his neck as she relished in the feeling of his hands once they reached up and ran along her back before they found their home on her waist.“You’ve talked me into it, love. I’ll be here.” Sirius whispered, moving one hand to the side of her head as he pulled back and looked down to her with a smile.“I’ll see you tomorrow.” Adelaide stood up on the tips of her toes and pressed her lips against his in a soft, gentle fashion. Her hands traveled down around his neck to rest on his chest and before she let herself get too carried away, she pulled herself away.“Goodnight, Sirius.”Adelaide left number twelve Grimmauld Place and apparated home. As she drew herself a warm bath to decompress from the long day, she did what she could to keep her mind free of the one person who had been constantly plaguing her every thought. Charlie Weasley.Kissing Sirius was nice. The feeling of his hands on her waist, on her face, sent shivers – the good kind – down her spine. It’s nice to have someone want her in return. So why was it that she saw her redheaded best friend every time she closed her eyes?

D E C E M B E R 1994, T H E B U R R O W

“Happy Christmas!”Molly Weasley stood at the front of the long dining table, a smile spread large across her lips. The entire family was not present, as they all stayed behind at Hogwarts to attend the Yule Ball, but Molly had both Bill and Charlie at her Christmas dinner and for that, she was extremely happy.Typically, Molly would be upset if the kids chose to remain at Hogwarts, but the Yule Ball was a special feast and Molly was glad that her kids could attend and experience the formal dance. “So, Charlie, how has work been? I know your sanctuary assisted with producing the dragons for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament?” Arthur finished chewing before he questioned his second eldest son. He took a sip of some of the firewhiskey that was in his glass with a smile on his face. Arthur and Molly typically did not keep the liquor around the home but because it was the holidays and they were having dinner with their two eldest sons, it seemed to be an appropriate occasion for the liquid treat.“It’s been great, Dad.” Charlie leaned back in his chair and smiled towards his father before glancing over at Molly. He could see the worry written all over her face.“Both of my boys,” She sighed, dabbing at eyes with the corner of her napkin. “You both work such hard, dangerous jobs. I just worry is all.” She sniffled before waving her hand around. “Let’s not talk about it. It’s Christmas. Finish your plates. We’ve got dessert!”Dinner finished without further issue or talk of dangerous jobs. Molly and Arthur gave Bill and Charlie their gifts – homemade sweaters with their first initial knit into the front. The Weasley kids were always so grateful for their Mum and her thoughtfulness. Bill, must his parents chagrin (especially Molly), could not stay too late. He took the floo network back to Gringott’s. He was being sent to an undisclosed location in the early morning hours and needed to be prepared.Charlie, though, agreed to stay until morning. Hugo had given him the go-ahead to take two days of leave to spend with his parents. He graciously took the offer and had already decided to try and see Adelaide and Tonks while he was home.After finishing a nightcap with her father, Charlie got changed into a flannel pajama set and found his way back downstairs to sit by the fireplace. He was surprised to hear other voices and even more surprised when he came face to face with Faustus and Adele Corden.“Charlie!” Adele beamed, moving to cup the young man’s face and kissing both of his cheeks in her natural greeting. “It is so wonderful to see you. You look well!”Charlie smiled, reaching forward and shook Faustus Corden’s hand. “It’s great to see you both.” He said with a nod. He glanced around them, a part of him hoping that he would see Adelaide stepping out of the green flames. But she was not there. And he could tell something was off by the look on Adele’s face as she spoke in a hushed tone to Molly.“Is everything ok?” Charlie questioned, crossing his arms over his chest as he looked to his father and Mr. Corden.“Well, like always we fell asleep a bit early after dinner. Adelaide usually retires to her room and so I went to check on her when I woke up.” Adele sighed and glanced over at the clock hanging on the wall before she looked back to Charlie.“She’s not home. So, well, we know you two have been writing each other. I was thinking maybe she came here.” Faustus sighed as he sat down, shaking his head. “But we can see that we were wrong in that assumption.”Charlie sighed, shaking his head. “To be honest, I haven’t spoken to Addy in a few months. I think she’s mad at me again.” He admitted sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck as he looked over at his parents.“She might be with Tonks.” Charlie continued, glancing at the time. “It’s almost midnight. She didn’t have work, right?”Faustus shook his head, “No. She was lucky enough to not have a shift today. We owled Andy, and Tonks was passed out on the couch so she’s not there. But Tonks said she’d head out to their usual haunts and see if she can find her.”Adele sat by the fireplace, nervously chewing away on her lower lip. “I know she’s a grown woman. But she usually will tell us when she leaves the house. She has her own flat, but she always stays the night of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. It’s just something we have always done.”Molly rubbed her friend’s upper arms. “Oh Adele, I’m sure it’s fine. Here, let me get you some tea!”Molly began ushering Adele into the kitchen to get that cup of tea.Charlie moved to the front door, grabbing his coat before turning back to his parents and the Cordens. “I’ll go meet up with Tonks.” Charlie called, buttoning his coat, and wrapping his scarf around his neck loosely before he grabbed his wand and apparated to Hogsmeade.“Arthur, are we overreacting?” Faustus rubbed roughly at his face with both hands before falling into the couch with a loud huff. “I mean, she’s a grown woman… Not a child. So should we just go home and go back to bed?”Arthur chuckled, patting his friend’s chest before sitting down beside him. “No, don’t worry. Everything will be ok.”“It’s just that I’m more concerned about her since everything that happened last year. I know I’ve heard from you and Molly both that Sirius Black is actually innocent, but I am a wee bit concerned she’s spending time with him. I don’t want her to get hurt… or worse.”Arthur was about to open his mouth to discuss more with Faustus when the fireplace roared a bright green – signaling that someone was traveling through the floo network.“Bloody hell!” Faustus shot up and tugged his daughter out of the flames as soon as she started stepping onto the carpet. “Where have you been? You had your Mum and me worried sick.”Adelaide stared up at her father with wide eyes. She was holding the letter they had left on the kitchen table in her hands – which was how she knew that they were at the Burrow. “What are you bloody talking about?” She cried out of frustration, swatting at her father’s hand before she was bombarded by her Mum and Molly, as well.“I was with a friend.” Adelaide told them with a sigh. “Honestly, I’m a grown adult but right now you’re treating me like a child!”“Charlie went out to look for you with Tonks.” Adele spoke softly to her daughter, “Faustus, will you send them a patronus and tell them to come home?”“Of course, my love.” Faustus nodded, giving his daughter a glare before pulling his wand out and producing a patronus to send to Charlie and Tonks.“I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I’m safe with Sirius, Mum, you have nothing to be concerned about.” Adelaide told her, reaching over to hold her mum’s hand.“Sirius Black?” Faustus spoke up, quirking a brow up as he stepped forward again. “I bloody knew it. He’s too old for you, Addy.”“We are just friends!” Adelaide groaned, covering her face with her hands before she stepped back again. She would need to get out of there before Charlie got back. She knew she was not ready to see him face to face. Not yet.And besides that – she was a liar. She was not just friends with Sirius. There was more between them. She was not sure what it was right now, or what it would become, but the feelings were too strong to ignore. Her parents would have to learn to just deal with that. She was an adult. Twenty, almost twenty-one, years old and could date – sleep with, fool around with, whatever terminology you want to use – whoever she wanted. Even a man who was fourteen years older than her.Faustus rolled his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak, most likely something rude, but Arthur clamped his hand down onto his shoulder to provide support, telling him to be quiet. Faustus understood and closed his mouth in a tight firm line and looked to his wife to be the one to speak up.“We’ll talk about this in the privacy of our own home. We don’t want to burden the Weasley family any longer than we already have, dear.” Adele looked over to her husband with a small smile. Faustus was the first to grab the floo, offering a nod and a wave goodbye to his friends before grumbling “Corden Residence”.Adele gave Molly a tight hug and a kiss on both cheeks, then the same for Arthur. “Happy Christmas, dears. Sorry for barging in tonight, we appreciate you all so much.” Adele then grabbed onto Adelaide’s arm, smiling at her daughter.Adele was much different than her husband. She was more laid back, more open. She knew her daughter was in good hands if she was with Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. Molly had told her as much. And she wanted her daughter to experience life, of course. She had seen the way Charlie’s sudden leave to Romania affected Adelaide, and of course to no fault of Molly and Arthur – Adele found herself wondering how Charlie could have grown up to be so selfish. After all, he did not even say goodbye to his parents, or the rest of his family!Adele and Molly had always joked that they would be family one day. And after Charlie left without a word, they both knew that it would never happen now. Unless Adelaide married another Weasley boy – which, no, they knew that would not happen.Adele believed in soulmates. Faustus was hers, to the end, just as Molly was to Arthur and vice versa. Maybe that was why they got along so well. They had similar lives’, except the Cordens’ were only blessed with one child, whereas the Weasley’s had seven.“I’m sorry about the intrusion, Mrs. Weasley.” Adelaide sighed softly, chewing on her lower lip. She chose to ignore the loud crack that could be heard from just outside of the front door. She knew who was on the other side and she could feel herself start to panic. She had not laid eyes on Charlie Weasley since the night she got drunk, kissed him, and told him that she loved him. She could not be here when he walked through that door. She had to scoop up the floo powder as fast as she could and jump into the fireplace before the door opened.But fate had other plans. Adele went first, choosing to not drag Adelaide along beside her. As Adelaide said goodbye to Molly and Arthur, she reached up to snag a small handful of the floo powder, knowing her father would help Arthur restock his supply since they had used a few handfuls on them. The front door pushed open and at the sound of the heavy boots on the hardwood floor, Adelaide turned slowly and looked over her shoulder.Her breath was now trapped in her chest. She felt frozen, which was truly not a good feeling. Her legs instantly felt like they were turning to jello and at the same time her feet felt as though they were glued to the floor. For the first time since June of 1991, Adelaide looked into Charlie’s eyes. She was not completely sure what she thought she would feel, but the panic was not surprising.“Adelaide…” Charlie stepped forward, unwrapping his scarf as he watched her. He could see from the corner of his eyes that his parents were slowly stepping back and ascended the stairs. “Can you…can you stay for a few minutes?” He was almost begging her now. He felt pathetic, but he felt this pain in the middle of his chest as he stood there and looked at her. She was just as beautiful as he remembered, her hair was thrown up in a messy braid, and her eyes were just as bright as they were the last night they spent together.Adelaide stayed silent, watching Charlie step closer and closer. “No, I’m sorry.” She spoke barely above a whisper, throwing the floo powder down and whipping around to step inside and calling out for her family home.Just like that, in the blink of an eye, Adelaide was gone. Charlie found himself standing there, in silence, for a few more minutes before he begrudgingly headed back to his bedroom. He knew he couldn’t push her with talking with him, especially if he wanted her to eventually forgive him so that they could move on from this. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►  F E B R U A R Y 1995, 12 G R I M M A U L D P L A C E  In the past two months, Adelaide had found herself spending most of her free time with either Tonks, or both Remus and Sirius. She had just gotten off from an overnight shift at St. Mungos when she sleepily walked through the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place.Sirius was bent over the fireplace, speaking to Remus through the flames.“Is that Remus?” Adelaide unbuttoned her coat and hung it on the coat rack in the corner of the hallway as she stepped further into the room to walk to Sirius.“Hello Adelaide!” Remus cheerily spoke through the flames, turning his attention quickly back to Sirius.“I can’t understand why he hasn’t told me about the second task. I’ve told him how dangerous this tournament is. I’m worried about the dream he had, Remus.” Sirius kept his gaze on Remus but reached over and slipped his hand onto the back of Adelaide’s bare thigh as she stepped up beside him.“I know, Sirius. We just have to support him from afar, you know this.” Remus sighed.Adelaide smiled softly, reaching down to playfully ruffle Sirius’ hair before she giggled and rushed away towards the sofa once he started swatting at her hand, reaching up to try and tickle her sides.“I’ll let you two go,” Remus spoke up again, a laugh escaping his lips. “Enjoy the night.”“You dare mess up my hair! Do you know how long it took me to get it just right today?” Sirius roared teasingly, pushing himself up and joining Adelaide on the sofa. He grabbed her thigh again, tugging her closer to him before planting his lips firmly on hers.“Sod off, Sirius! You know you look fit even when your hair is a mess!” Adelaide giggled against his lips, kissing him back as her hands found their way onto either side of his neck.Reluctantly pulling away from her lips, Sirius let his head rest on her chest. His hand stayed on her thigh, slipping beneath the hem of her healer uniform.“Have I told you how much of a turn on this little get up is?”Adelaide rolled her eyes and playfully tugged on his hair. “You’re a pig.” She teased. “But yes, you have told me. Numerous times.”If someone would have told Sirius last year that he would have found happiness so soon after escaping from his own personal hell within the confines of Azkaban, he would have laughed in their face. Adelaide was a part of the light at the end of the tunnel he had fought so hard - the past thirteen years - to get to. He was only thirty-four, but the years spent in Azkaban really had changed him, mentally and physically. Adelaide, in her happy youth, really did help him in more ways than none.“I’m sorry, love,” Sirius smirked, looking up at her. “I can’t help myself!”Adelaide laughed softly, running her fingertips along his cheek before playfully scratching at his facial hair. “Breakfast is in the kitchen, but I want to run a bath before I eat. I smell like the hospital.”Sirius helped her up, letting his hand rest on her lower back as he guided her up the stairs. She knew where everything was. She had spent so much time here at number twelve Grimmauld Place that Sirius was glad they were able to make enough happy memories to try and banish all the sad ones he had of his youth.“You know I can run my own bath, yes?” Adelaide had closed the toilet seat and sat herself down, slowly starting to untie her shoes as she watched Sirius gather a few essentials before starting to run the water for her. She slipped her feet from the shoes, setting them off to the side before she started unrolling the knee-high white stockings she had to wear as part of her hospital uniform.“I thought you could use some company.” Sirius did not bother looking back at her, standing up after he had plugged the drain shut. He started unbuttoning his own shirt before looking back at her now.“Oh?” Adelaide grinned, starting to now unweave her hair from the braid it was thrown back in. “So, you don’t want to join me for your own selfish reasons?” She teased.Adelaide was only playing with Sirius. Truly, she did not mind him joining her in the bath. In the past two months they had explored their relationship in a sexual nature, so she wasn’t worried about him seeing her naked.“Yes.” Sirius let his shirt fall from his shoulders, crumbling into a pile on the floor. He then stepped out of his trousers and grinned down at her.“I’m a very, very selfish man, Adelaide Corden.”    

“You naughty boy.” Adelaide teased, giggles escaping her lips as Sirius reached down to grab her hands and pull her up from the toilet seat.He spun her around and slowly starting tugging down the zipper to her uniform. “Yes, I can be quite naughty.” Sirius teased, leaning down to plant soft, wet kisses along the back of her neck and shoulder blades as he helped her out of her clothing.Sirius had ditched the rest of his clothing beforehand and had slipped into the white ceramic clawfoot tub. Adelaide found herself stepping in and resting her back against his chest, enjoying the feeling of his arms around her waist and the hot water splashing around her legs.“Harry is a brilliant wizard, Sirius.” Adelaide found herself speaking up, though keeping her eyes shut as her hands dipped beneath the bubble-filled water as she ran them down his thighs. “I know that you’re concerned for him. And truthfully, I believe you have every right to be. I remember reading about the Triwizard Tournament. It’s dangerous, that much is true but I also don’t think Dumbledore would do anything to put him in harm’s way on purpose.”Sirius sighed softly, enjoying the way her fingernails scraped against his skin. “I know, love, but as the only piece that I have left of James and Lily, I feel overprotective.” He admitted, leaning his head back and resting it on the edge of the tub as Adelaide continued running her nails against his skin.“You’re a good man, Sirius Black.” Adelaide whispered, slowly slipping forward a bit, remaining in between Sirius’ legs, ignoring the way the water splashed up around her and over the edge of the tub as she turned around, now kneeling before him.Feeling the movement of the water, Sirius opened his eyes and peered up at Adelaide. “To be honest, love, you may be the only person,” He let his hands move from the sides of the tub to sink beneath the water so he could run them along her thighs. “Besides Remus,” He smirked, “Who thinks that.” Finally finishing his thought, Sirius leaned up and pressed his lips against her neck, enjoying the feeling of her body settling in closer to his now.“Nonsense.” Adelaide breathed out, enjoying the feeling of his fingertips brushing against her sides now before she found herself slipping onto his lap, her knees pressing into the bottom of the tub on either side of his waist. “Molly Weasley speaks highly of you.” She ran her fingers through his hair, a soft smile finding it’s place on her face as she watched him. “And I know you haven’t met them, yet…” She definitely did not want to ruin the moment by speaking of her parents, but here goes nothing.“But my parents will love you, eventually…” She giggled softly. “I think having Molly and Arthur on your side have helped, especially with my Mum.” She told him, scraping her fingernails against his scalp after bringing up a handful of water – to the best of her ability – and wetting his hair. The droplets trickled down the sides of his face and the feeling had a bit of a calming effect on the rest of Sirius’ body.Faustus, on the other hand, was taking a bit longer to warm up to the idea of his ‘baby girl’ spending so much time with a man who was still on the run from the Ministry. Adelaide knew that once they were able to me – however long that would take she was unsure of – her father would come to like Sirius.“Daddy dearest not a fan?” Sirius teased, his hands moving to her backside, pulling her flush against him as he opened his eyes and looked up at her.Adelaide let out a girlish squeal when he pulled her against him. Her hands moved to either side of his body, grasping the rim of the tub as she looked down at him. She could feel him start to harden between her legs, a faint blush creeping across her cheeks.“I’d prefer not to talk about my parents right now, Sirius.” She told him, leaning down to press her lips against his softly. She let her eyes flutter shut, her teeth playfully nibbling on his lower lip before she pulled back to look down at him.“I couldn’t agree more, darling.”Sirius found his hands sinking lower, gripping onto her backside in a firm grip before he leaned up and kissed her. The kiss was passionate. Breathtaking, really. Sirius found himself constantly putting all he could behind each and every single kiss between himself and Adelaide. He wanted her to know how much she truly meant to him.Twelve years of insanity in Azkaban and he never really believed that he deserved the happiness he was beginning to really feel whenever he was with her. There was normal happiness and then there was next level happiness. Adelaide brought out feelings he had not felt since he was a boy. Now maybe it was just because she was so much younger than him or because she had not experienced the kind of heartbreak, loss, and loneliness he has in the thirty-four years of his life.There was nothing wrong with having fun. Sirius did not think that it would be too serious. He was a smart man, and he knew that Adelaide was still a bit hung up on Charlie. After all, she had talked to him about everything that went on. She confided in him about things and Sirius was honored that she trusted him enough to open herself up like that.Adelaide giggled at the feeling of Sirius gripping onto her backside. Taking control of the situation, Adelaide lifted herself slowly, so she was no longer pressing down against him. Her hands cupped either side of his face as she let her forehead drop against him. “We’re going to make a mess of the bathroom floor if we keep this up, you know.” She whispered to him, nuzzling her nose against his as she pulled back to make eye contact.Sirius was smirking. It was quite obvious that he did not care, not even one single iota, about water splashing over the tub and creating puddles on the marble floor. He kept one hand firmly on her hip, while the other snaked around between her legs. His fingers firmly found the bundle of nerves that stood at the head of her altar, the most delicate part of a woman that Sirius enjoyed – a bit too much. Adelaide found that he was insatiable. She chalked that up to him being imprisoned for twelve years.There was a tale that Adelaide had heard one of her colleagues from work joking about. The tale was that it was believed that every seven years, we essentially become new people. In the span of seven years, all the cells that make up our body replace themselves with new ones.Adelaide had a laugh at that, of course. The girl was muggle-born, and her a sister who was not a witch who was studying to be the muggle equivalent of a healer. In some respects, it was a nice sentiment. But Adelaide did not know how true that really was.But if it were true, it would mean that the body that Sirius was in now, and the skin he was living beneath, had never known the human touch. Adelaide liked the idea of magically being the only woman who had touched him, kissed his skin, and felt his body beneath hers in the throws of passionate love making.With her head falling forward and tucking into the crook of his neck, Adelaide let out a happy sigh at the feeling of his hand between her legs.“Sirius,” She moaned softly, her hands gripping his shoulders now as her hips grinded down into his hand. “You’re killing me.” She whispered teasingly, her eyes remaining shut as her hands made their way down from his shoulders. Bypassing his chest, enjoying the feeling of his wet skin, Adelaide found her hands just beneath the surface of the water against his abdomen.“Well, I’m certainly not trying to do that.” He joked, though his fingers continued pressing firmly on her and moving in slow circles – painfully slow really.Adelaide found herself laughing softly. She relished the fact that he could always make her laugh. He was the type of man who was not afraid of his feelings. He was also not afraid of going after what he wanted. Adelaide commended him for that because if he had chosen to ignore the feelings between the two of them, they would not be here right now.Adelaide’s hands traveled further down until she was able to wrap her fingers around his hardened member and give him a few quick pumps. She leaned down and kissed him softly, looking to the counter as she held her hand out and whispered “Accio wand.” Calling her wand and catching it as it levitated towards her outstretched hand, Adelaide pointed it towards herself. She whispered a charm, a protective contraception charm. The tip of her wand lit up a gentle amber color, and when the warmth stopped spreading throughout her abdomen, Adelaide knew it was complete. She quickly tossed the wand to the ground by the tub.Still doing her best to ignore the feeling of the water now turning cold, Adelaide shifted up and forward, lining herself up with the tip of his length before slowly easing herself down onto him. A soft moan escaped from her lips as she went to quickly grab onto the edge of the tub for support. Sirius’ hands moved to her hips, assisting her with moving down against him.Adelaide let out a soft moan, enjoying the sensation as she began, slowly, moving her hips up and down. She was trying to minimize the water splashing over the tub, but also enjoyed going slow to savor the feeling of him beneath her. She felt as though their bodies fit perfectly with one another. Her hands soon moved to either side of his face, pulling his head up from its reclined position. She moved to speak but was cut off by his lips pressing against hers roughly.His hands slipped back more, grabbing her backside, and moving her hips to his own accord, speeding them up with a soft groan.“I told you that I’m insatiable.”Adelaide giggled against his lips, letting him take control of her hips. “You truly are insatiable, Sirius Black.” She whispered, her fingertips dancing across his cheek as she looked down at him. She was afraid to blink – she did not want to miss the look of pleasure crossing his features as she rocked her hips down into his when they met.Sirius started pushing Adelaide back, letting her head hang as the tips of her hair dipped beneath the water. His lips soon found her neck, suckling gently as he moved across her collarbones before finding her breasts. In all honesty, Sirius could be a selfish man. But when he was with Adelaide, he was far from selfish.All he wanted was to make her feel good. And not just when they were intimate with one another. Sirius had this deep desire to protect Adelaide, to provide for her. He had never gotten the chance to do so when he was younger – and to be quite honest, he had never found someone that he felt that strongly connected to (other than the rest of the Marauders, and Lily). He wasn’t sure why he felt this strongly, this fast. Maybe it was the fact that she had helped him when he needed it the most. She put herself in danger – danger of losing her job, losing her life – and for what? To simply help him. He genuinely did not feel worthy.Adelaide wrapped her arms around his shoulders, keeping a firm grip on him as she continued moving herself up and down against him. She was silently praying that Kreacher was nowhere close by because the sounds of their lovemaking mixed with the water splashing violently over the edge of the tub was echoing loudly throughout the bathroom.Sirius ran his hands up and down her sides and back, holding her against him as he opened his eyes and looked up at her. “You,” He whispered, pecking her lips softly. “Are bloody perfect, Adelaide.” He told her with a soft moan, his teeth biting down on his lower lip as if to try and hold back more breathy moans.Adelaide shook her head, cupping one side of his face with her hand, ignoring the pruning of her skin – which was becoming a bit painful - as she looked down at him. She kept the other arm wrapped around his shoulders, keeping herself close to him as she let her own moans escape her lips.“Stop.” She told him, tugging at his lower lip with her thumb, pulling it from between his teeth. “I want to hear you.” She breathed, letting her forehead fall against his as she started picking up the pace of her hips. It felt as though most of the water had already escaped the tub, puddled on the floor beneath them now. She could feel the pressure in her lower abdomen start to tighten, signaling that she was close to a climax.Hearing Adelaide’s gasping pleas to hear him, Sirius leaned to meet her halfway and kiss her lips passionately. He immediately parted his lips against hers, inviting himself in with his tongue as he relished in the taste of her. Sirius knew she was close to climax. Over the past two months, he had done what he could to memorize every inch of her body, inside and out. He could feel her inner walls fluttering around him, which also caused a shiver to run down from the base of his skull to the very end of his spine.“Adelaide,” Sirius whispered against her lips, another moan escaping both of their lips as Sirius held onto her hips and helped her move against him for another moment or two before they both found their release.After a minute or holding onto one another, Adelaide raised herself up from Sirius’ lap and sat back down between his legs with her back facing him. “Will you wash my hair for me?” She looked over her shoulder at him with a smirk.Sirius reached forward, bypassing Adelaide as he pulled the plug to get rid of the small amount of cold water left in the tub before closing the drain back up and turning the handles to fill the tub once more with warm water.Disregarding their skin being pruned more than a box of raisins, Sirius washed Adelaide’s hair for her, rinsing the suds from her blonde tresses before they switched positions and she did the same for him. There was something so domesticated about helping one another bathe and Adelaide found herself with nothing but butterflies in her belly as she massaged his scalp before rinsing his hair free of the shampoo and conditioner.“We should probably get out of here. You need your rest.” Sirius spoke up, lifting Adelaide’s hand from the water and planting a soft kiss to it before he pulled the plug once more. He grabbed two towels, wrapping his waist in one before wrapping the other around Adelaide as she stood in the tub. She grabbed her wand, banishing the puddles of water from the floor before climbing out and making her way to the adjoining bedroom that Sirius had been staying in.After she dressed in loose clothing that had once belonged to Sirius, Adelaide performed a quick drying spell on her hair before jumping into the bed and pulling the covers up over her body. The sheets were made from the finest silk and had to be old. They were kept in great condition, that much Adelaide could tell.“This mattress is like sleeping on a pile of clouds.” She sighed happily, already feeling the exhaustion start to take over her.“Only the best for you, love.” Sirius teased, sitting on the edge of the bed beside her. He brushed hair from her face before leaning down and planting a gentle kiss to her forehead. Her eyes were already closing, and her breathing evened out.Sirius found himself watching her for a few more moments before he got up and headed down the grand staircase. He figured he should put the food away for her to eat once she woke up. He felt as though he was truly on cloud nine.Nothing could change that. Right?

J U N E 1995Happiness can only last for so long. True, genuine happiness – that is. February turned into March. March turned into April. April turned into May. May turned into June. Adelaide spent more time at 12 Grimmauld Place than she did her own flat. She was fine with it, of course. Sirius was still in hiding – so it was not like he could come to her place every once in a while. It was tough, but the genuine joy she got from spending time with him made up for the secrecy she was intertwined with when it came to where and who she was spending her time with.After hearing that the final task in the Triwizard Tournament was open to the public for attendance, Sirius and Remus talked to Adelaide about attending with the Weasley’s so she could be there for Harry. Adelaide, of course, agreed right away. She did not need to be pressured or begged to say yes. It gave her a chance to see her father as he would also be in attendance.The second Hogwarts champion – Cedric Diggory – also lived nearby in Devon, and she had heard her father speak of his father, Amos.“I wish you could come with me. You know, you could…maybe?” She finished pulling her hair back in a braid, turning to look at Sirius who was standing in the doorway of the bathroom.“You know that’s not possible, love. Especially not at that school. It’s just too risky.” He sighed softly. It pained him that he had to be this secret stowaway. He wanted more than anything to be there for Harry… To be with Adelaide.“Not even as our furry little friend?” She teased, walking over to Sirius before she pressed her lips against his cheek in a soft kiss.“I think that would bring more attention.” He admitted, shaking his head. He wrapped his arms around her waist, tugging her into his chest before catching her lips in a soft, gentle kiss. She giggled and tried to escape his grip, her hands smacking his chest playfully.“I hate when you’re right, you know.” She finally let up, wrapping her arms around his neck before she leaned up to kiss his lips back.“Get a room, you two.” Remus called from the first floor. The ex-professor decided to spend the night with Sirius, so they both had someone to pass the time with until they found out the results of the tournament – courtesy of Adelaide, of course.“Mate, we have plenty of rooms to chose from.” Sirius called back, a devious look spreading across his face as his hands slipped down and grabbed Adelaide’s backside roughly.A gasp escaped her lips as she smacked his chest again. “Hands off, Sirius! I’m running late already!” She squealed, wiggling out of his grasp and floating down the staircase towards Remus.“Sorry, Rem. He’s an animal.” She teased, a smirk forming on her lips as she leaned up to peck his cheek softly in greeting.“I heard that!” Sirius called from upstairs. He chose to wait in following her down the stairs for obvious reasons.Remus shook his head, taking a sip of the brandy he had helped himself to. “Will you tell Harry we said hello and that we’re rooting for him?” He questioned Adelaide, watching the girl move to slip her shoes on her feet, tying the laces tightly before standing back up again.“Of course, Remus. You know I will. I’m running late, I wanted to try and get a chance to say hello before the task begins.” The blonde rushed into the other room, finding her wand sitting on the table besides her bag from work. Snatching it up quickly and tucking it in the back pocket of her jeans, she spun around at hearing Sirius walk into the room, going directly to the bar to pour himself a drink.She had always kept quiet about his drinking habits. She was never one to judge, though she could not help but feel worried for him.“Please remember to eat some food tonight. I made sure to bring a few things and the kitchen is stocked now.” Adelaide told him, running a hand up his back to snake around his neck and pull him down to kiss his cheek softly. “Promise me?”Sirius sighed and glanced over at Remus for a moment before he looked back down to Adelaide with a nod. “Of course. You know Moony will make me eat and not just binge myself on this delicious brandy.” He teased, kissing her cheek back before turning back to the bar and pouring himself a tall glass of said brandy.“I’ll make sure he takes care of himself, don’t worry Addy.” Remus chuckled, setting his glass down and giving the blonde witch a hug. “Give Harry our love.”Adelaide nodded with a smile, hugging Remus back before moving away towards the fireplace. Once Sirius was able to get it attached to the floo network it had made travel for the healer much easier. With one final look over her shoulder at Sirius, she could see the intense look of worry on his face and chose to turn back around and throw the floo powder to the ground before stepping in and calling out for the Hogs Head Inn. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►  “My little dove, there you are!” Faustus stood up from the bleachers, waving down at his daughter who was trying to search through the crowd for him.“Hi Dad.” Adelaide smiled, weaving her way through the crowd, planting a soft kiss on his cheek as she gave him a hug. She moved to Arthur and Molly, greeting them in almost the same manner. No matter how angry she was at Charlie, she would always think of Molly and Arthur as a second set of parents she was blessed to have.“Ron, where’s Harry?” Adelaide tilted her head to the side as she peered down at the redhead who was seated beside Hermione.“He should be down there. With Mad-Eye… Creepy man, he is.” Ron groaned, pointing down towards the end of the bleachers, where the beginning of what seemed like a maze was.Adelaide turned to look and let out a sigh. She had heard Remus and Sirius speak of Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody. She had also heard of him from Tonks in many of her hour-long tirades about Auror training.“I’ll be back.” She said to the group, tucking a few strands of hair behind her ears as she moved through the crowd again until she felt solid ground beneath her feet.“Harry!” She called, raising an arm, and waving to him with a smile.“Adelaide! Hi.” Harry greeted back, trying to swallow down the nerves.Adelaide wrapped her arms around Harry and gave him a tight, secure hug. She could see that he was nervous. “Sirius and Remus send their love.” She whispered in his ear as she pulled away from the hug. Moody was standing off to the side, a walking stick firmly in his grasp and planted on the ground as he watched the interaction.“Thank you.” Harry sighed, smiling to Adelaide before glancing over to Moody, who was signaling for him to wrap it up. “I wish that they could be here.” He admitted sheepishly, rubbing at the back of his neck.Adelaide sighed. “They wish the same, Harry. Truly, they do. But… until we get things figured out with the Ministry, this is just how it has to be.”As much as Adelaide hated it – it was the truth. Deep down Adelaide knew that she may never get to be out in public with Sirius Black. She may never get to hold his hand and force him shopping like a normal girlfriend typically does with their boyfriend.“Harry, no more talking. Let’s go. We need to get your head in the game.” Moody hobbled over, grabbing onto Harry’s arm as he began looking over Adelaide.A sudden rush of – something – ran over her. She felt immediately uncomfortable standing by this man. The glass eye was rolling around, never being able to focus on something or someone, and his natural eye firmly planted its gaze on her.“Uh,” she cleared her throat and moved to cross her arms over her chest. “Good luck again, Harry. We’ll talk later.” She said, a small smile forced its way onto her lips as she watched Harry walk off with Moody.Merlin, something was off with that man, Adelaide thought to herself as she turned on her heel and hurried off the grounds and back into the bleachers.Adelaide felt a rush of chill in the air around her as the horns went off. The final task had finally begun. Ron and Hermione were pressed close into each other, whispering about what the final task could really be, and what Harry might be experiencing. Adelaide stayed silent though most of the people around her were chattering about.The first one back was the beautiful girl from Beauxbatons, Fleur Delacour. Adelaide shot up straight in the stands, trying to watch how she was reacting. She seemed really shaken up.Next, Viktor Krum from Durmstrang returned, tripping over himself as he was pulled up by Igor Karkaroff, who Adelaide assumed was the Headmaster of Durmstrang. She tried to stay in the loop and lucky enough she was sitting besides Hermione, who was rifling off a few facts for her. The healer assumed she could sense the confusion in her, to which she was extremely grateful.It felt like each minute that passed by had stretched longer than sixty seconds. It wasn’t until a gasp, from who Adelaide was unsure, rang out in the silence of the crowd. Almost everyone stood up at once, cheering loudly as the band started playing. Harry was back, and he was crowned the winner of the Triwizard Tournament.Something was wrong, though. Adelaide gripped onto Hermione’s wrist, “Hermione, something is wrong.” She whispered, shifting forward as she tried her best to look over crowd, silently cursing the fact that everyone seated below her was taller than her when they were on their feet.She rushed forward, hurrying down the steps. Her feet were clanging loudly on the bleachers as she went and before she knew it, she was now rushing by Dumbledore as Fleur let out a bloodcurdling scream.She got to Harry just before Dumbledore, and as the Headmaster grasped onto the crying boy, Adelaide found herself dropping to her knees besides who she assumed was Cedric Diggory.“No…” She whispered, hands covering her mouth now as she took in a deep breath. She looked up and watched Harry fight against Dumbledore’s grip.Adelaide felt her blood run cold. She shifted to the side, slipping her hand down to Cedric’s neck, double checking for a pulse. There was no pulse, no heartbeat, no breathing. Adelaide looked to Dumbledore than to Harry as the boy threw himself over his schoolmate’s dead body.“He’s back!”He’s back?Adelaide watched Harry, trying to figure out what he was talking about. What could have happened in that maze that left one boy dead and the other screaming and crying.“Voldemort’s back! Cedric…he told me to bring his body back. I couldn’t leave him… I couldn’t leave him!” Harry continued to cry.Adelaide froze at this outburst. Her fingertips slipped from the cold skin of Cedric’s neck as she looked over at Dumbledore. The headmaster had Harry’s face cupped between his hands. Adelaide felt like she couldn’t move.The Dark Lord was back? There was no way.Adelaide felt a presence behind her and turned up to make eye contact with Professor Snape. She could hear a man’s voice, ringing out loudly in her ears and before she could blink, Severus scooped her up a bit roughly and pulled her out of the way.Amos Diggory rushed forward, dropping to his knees beside his son. Adelaide felt a sob making its way out of her throat, her hands quickly reaching up to cover her mouth as she looked to Severus and then back to Harry just in time to watch Moody scoop the despondent boy up.The sounds of Amos’ cries echoed loud in the dark night. Adelaide soon felt warm hands on her shoulders as she turned, she came face to face with her father, who wrapped his arms around her protectively. Arthur stood behind Amos but knew that there was nothing he could do to provide any type of comfort.Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Moody limping away, Harry tight in his grasp.“Where the bloody hell is he taking him?” She grumbled to herself, wiping at her face to get rid of the tears that quickly making their debut on her cheeks.Something was wrong. More wrong than a boy losing his life. Adelaide knew she was not qualified to chase after the Auror and The Boy Who Lived, but she made sure to slowly slip from her father’s grip and rush through the crowd after the two.

Adelaide should have known better. She should have known that something was not right. Her gut was telling her to turn back and get someone in authority. Dumbledore, perhaps… Maybe even Severus. She felt an odd sensation in her hands, almost like pins and needles. Her magic crackling deep within her, underneath her skin – as she held her wand out before her tight in her hand.The corridor leading to the room she had watched Moody and Harry rush in to was extremely dark. She had whispered lumos and watched a small light peek out from the tip of her hand as she continued along the empty hallway.She was having a hard time controlling her breathing, and soon figured out it must have always been the cause of her failed attempts at pranking Charlie during every sleepover at The Burrow.She could hear clanging of different objects in the room and stood beside the door, pressed against the wall. She quickly whispered nox and let her hand fall to her side after slipping the wand back into her pocket.“It was you from the beginning!” Adelaide pressed closer, hearing Harry on the other end. He did not sound too distressed, but after hearing Moody mimic Harry and begin speaking back to him, the healer could feel the hairs on the back of her neck stand up.“You were in that graveyard because it was meant to be so!”Adelaide could hear Harry grunt, almost like he was struggling against someone.That was it. She could not just stand here and eavesdrop any longer. She stood up straight, glanced behind her shoulder to see if anyone else had followed – which as far as she is aware, they had not. She quickly pulled the door open and rushed in, immediately placing herself in between Harry and Moody.“What the bloody hell is wrong with you?” She cried, staring up at the man as she watched him shiver and shake as though he was standing in the pouring, cold rain. His back hunched forward and he let out a weird sound. It almost sounded like he was choking on his own saliva.“Addy, you shouldn’t be here.” Harry whispered, still rubbing at his arm where he had been cut.Moody started towards both Harry and Adelaide and as soon as he grabbed onto her arms, he shoved her down to the ground – his main goal was to get to Harry and now she was just in his way. He would do whatever he had to in order to get to Harry Potter.Adelaide tumbled to the ground with force, her head knocking into the trunk that stood behind her before the fireplace. She heard the door burst open, Dumbledore shouting out and disarming Moody before her vision started to blur and she glanced up at Severus as she watched him rush into the room behind the Headmaster.McGonagall was not far behind and instantly went towards the girl who was grimacing in pain at the painful cut on the back of her head. “Ms. Corden, are you alright?”Adelaide nodded, rubbing at the back of her neck before blinking a few times. “Yes, I’ll be fine. Just a scratch.” She whispered, trying to will away the tears forming in her eyes. She could handle injuries on other people, but when she herself got injured, it was a different story. She usually became quite emotional. This time was no different.Harry helped her up and held onto her arm to provide support as they stood back and watched Snape force a potion down Moody’s throat.“Do you know who I am?” Dumbledore’s voice was dripping with anger.Adelaide quickly concluded that the potion Snape provided must have been veritaserum because the next question that came out of Dumbledore’s mouth was if whether the man before them, slithering in Dumbledore’s grasp, was Alastor Moody or not.Harry and Adelaide were quickly ushered away from the trunk, still holding onto one another. Adelaide felt like she was in a nightmare – so she could only imagine how Harry was feeling. She immediately covered her mouth as a gasp escaped, watching Snape flick his wand towards the trunk and having it open. The trunk opened like a nesting doll – one smaller than the previous fit inside, creating a pyramid shape as the final one clicked open.Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall peered over and soon found the real Alastor Moody huddled in the corner of the device he had been held in for the past year.“Are you ok, Alastor?” Dumbledore called out with a sigh.“I’m sorry, Albus.” Moody called from within.Adelaide glanced to the man sitting in the chair, listening on the conversation from beside her. Snape opened the flask and took in a large whiff.“Polyjuice potion.”Dumbledore sighed out of frustration. “Well, looks like we know who has been raiding your supply cabinet now.” He told Snape, before turning back to the chair behind them.The man who had been living as Alastor Moody for the past school year started groaning. His skin looked like it was becoming loose, hanging around his face. His eye bulging out of the socket and teeth chattering as his hands clutched the arms of the chair tightly. The Polyjuice was wearing off and soon they would find out who was behind it all.Adelaide found herself grimacing at the sounds he was making. Again, he sounded like he was choking on something – mostly his own saliva. Although she had studied Polyjuice potion before, she had never actually been able to see the effects of the transformation – either way – before. The noises coming from deep within his throat sent chills down Adelaide’s spine. Harry’s grasp on her arm loosened, and she glanced over to him as he started walking closer to the man who was slowly transforming back to his true identity.Once the transformation was complete, Adelaide stepped back and remained closer to Minerva. She could see Harry’s curiosity getting the better of him as he leaned down to peer at the man’s face.The man’s tongue was darting out from behind his thin set of lips, out of his mouth, almost violently thrashing about. It reminded Adelaide of a snake. That thought sent another chill down her spine.She jolted upright when the man let out a holler, jumping up to try and reach for Harry. Dumbledore was able to get in between the two and push the man back into the chair.Minerva, forever brave and protective over her students, stepped forward and pointed her wand into the man’s face. This action kept him still – except for the tongue that continued to slither in and out of his mouth.Adelaide found herself looking over at Snape, tilting her head to the side as if to silently ask him what the bloody fuck was going on.“Barty Crouch…junior.” Dumbledore shook his head.Snape remained silent, ignoring the silent pleading looks from Adelaide. The blonde stepped forward, now standing on the other side of Harry.“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.” Barty hissed, a look of complete and utter derangement behind his eyes as he pulled up his sleeve.The Dark Mark. The ink slithered on his skin and again Adelaide felt a sickening feeling in the deep pits of her stomach. The way the snake slithered around, seeming to pulse within the flesh. There was obviously a reason they called it the dark mark. She knew about dark magic but had never seen anything like this before.Dumbledore roughly grabbed onto Harry’s arm, “Show him yours, Harry. Show him!” He hissed, pulling the sleeve of Harry’s arm up, showcasing the deep cut that was still slowly oozing blood.Adelaide grimaced at the roughness Dumbledore was portraying. She stepped forward, almost as if to pull Harry away from him but was stopped. Looking up at the hand tightly grasping her shoulder to keep her rooted in place.“You know what this means.” Barty hissed, his tongue darting in and out as a wide grin spread from ear to ear. “He’s back!” he cried happily. “Lord Voldemort has returned.”Harry started apologizing, but Dumbledore quickly silenced him as he turned to Minerva. “Minnie, I need you to owl Azkaban. Let them know we found their missing prisoner.”Minerva quickly exited the room, Adelaide stood beside Severus and watched her go. She wanted to go with her – she did not want to be anywhere near this vile man any longer. The way his tongue was darting out as though he were a snake sent chills down her spine. And certainly not the good kind of chills. But she needed to stay put for Harry’s sake. She would make sure she was the one who healed his arm.“I’ll be a hero.” Barty grinned evilly, his eyes roaming around the room before landing on Adelaide. Dumbledore soon stepped between the two, gesturing for Adelaide to start towards the door with Harry.“Severus.” Dumbledore whispered, giving a solemn nod to the potions professor before leaving the room. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► “Sirius? Remus?” Adelaide stepped out from the green flames of the fireplace. Her sneakers made an awful squeaking noise as she walked along the marble flooring. The sitting room was empty, so she could only assume that the two men had already gone to bed.She sighed and rubbed at the side of her face. Her skin was dry, but still felt sticky and gross from having been a sweaty mess after the events of the evening. She made it up the staircase and as quietly as possible, she opened the door to Sirius’ room and closed it behind herself. Slipping from her noisy sneakers, Adelaide lowered herself slowly to the side of Sirius’ bed.“Sirius.” She whispered, gently running her fingertips along the side of his face before raking them through his hair and against his scalp.“Hmm...” Sirius started to stir beneath her touch. “Addy?” He whispered. His voice hoarse as he moved to sit up.“What’s wrong? What happened?” He was still over the covers of the bed and an opened book was sprawled out in his lap. Aa half-empty glass of brandy was sitting beside the bed on the nightstand, condensation from the chilled liquid most likely causing a permanent ring to etch into the wood. He had no recollection of falling asleep and was pissed off at himself for doing so.“Bloody hell, I fell asleep. Love, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to do that.” He cleared his throat and stretched his legs a bit. He wiped the sleep from his eyes before he was able to get a better look at her.“Bloody hell…” He muttered, reaching forward quickly to cup Adelaide’s face. “What happened?” he repeated, brushing her cheek with his thumb, wiping the tears that were now escaping from her eyes.“He’s back, Sirius.” She whispered to him, a soft sob escaping her lips. She then delved deep into the story of what occurred throughout the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament. At some point, Remus had entered the room. He must have heard the sobs and hysterical reenactment of the night’s events by Adelaide.She went into as much detail as she could. Harry had relayed more information to her once she was able to heal his arm, and Severus healed her head. She told Sirius and Remus about Cedric, about Harry bringing his body back after he was killed by Lord Voldemort. She then told them all about Moody and Barty Crouch jr. She told them about how Barty, though who she, and everyone else, thought was Alastor Moody, had pushed her out of the way to get to Harry – which was how she needed to be healed by Severus in the first place.Adelaide ignored the twitching of Sirius’ fingers wrapped around her wrist at her mention of Severus. She knew there was a large amount of bad blood between the potions professor and the remaining members of the self-proclaimed Marauders.“I’m glad you’re ok, Adelaide.” Remus placed a friendly hand on her shoulder, giving her a squeeze, before pulling away. “I’m going to head to bed. We’ll, uh, talk more in the morning.”Adelaide and Sirius both knew what he was talking about. The healer made sure to keep her story as detailed as possible without mentioning the Dark Lord – at least as much as she could.“Let me see your head.” Sirius, shifted to now sit behind Adelaide, letting his legs slip around her from behind so he could pull her into his chest protectively. His fingers weaved through her hair, sighing softly at the bump he could feel on the back of her head. He refused to admit that Snivellous had done a good job at healing the cut, since he could not see any marking other than her skin being red and irritated – he knew he had healed her successfully. Still… He did not like the idea of Severus Snape being that close to her. He was thinking irrationally, of course. But he was Sirius Black, after all. He always thought irrationally.Adelaide let out a soft sigh as she let Sirius wrap himself around her from behind, pulling her in tight. She felt at home in his arms and a part of her knew she would never articulate that feeling to him. “I’m fine, Sirius. Don’t worry about me.” She whispered, turning her head slightly so she could lean back against his shoulder.Her hands found their way onto his forearms once his arms wrapped around her waist.“It’s hard not to worry, love. I think I’m angrier at myself. I should have been there.” Sirius shifted them back so that he could lay against the headboard of the bed. “I should have been there for you. For Harry.”Adelaide shook her head, “Don’t think like that, Sirius. You cannot help what happened. And you also cannot help that you are still a wanted man. We will get that eventually squared away. I know it. I promise you.” She whispered, trailing her fingernails along his skin, sending apparent shivers down his spine as she felt him shake beneath her.She turned around, keeping herself pressed close to him as her head found its way onto his chest. “My father has some connections in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.”Sirius smiled, running his hands along her back for another minute or two before he cradled the back of her head, keeping her pressed to his chest. “You are a sweetheart, Adelaide Corden. I am so bloody grateful that you are the one I found in the woods that day.”With her face pressed into his chest, Adelaide was glad that he could not see the sadness washing over her face. She remembered that day all too well.She had gotten a letter from Charlie and cried her eyes out, all alone, in the snow. Quite pathetic, really.“Don’t forget the first encounter. My fainting spell just outside of the Gryffindor common room after you slashed the poor Fat Lady.” She laughed softly, playfully tickling at Sirius’ side to show him that she was strictly teasing him.“But I am grateful that you found me that day too, Sirius Black.” She whispered. She let her eyes fall shut and began listening to the rhythm of Sirius’ heartbeat. The pattern started out fast, but soon slowed down to match her own. She found herself falling asleep but not before hearing Sirius mutter to himself.“That Charlie Weasley is a bloody dumb arse.”

J U L Y 1995, R O M A N I A Charlie felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up as he continued reading over the letter from his father. A part of him felt like maybe his dear old dad was yanking his chain. Lord Voldemort could not possibly be back. Right?Folding the letter up and stuffing it into the envelope before dropping it back into the open drawer of his dresser. Charlie grabbed his t shirt from the back of the chair and tugged it on over his head. He had already wasted most of his morning reading the letter and needed to grab a quick bite to eat before his day.Arthur wrote about Adelaide being there, about being with Harry when it all went down with Crouch. That just, to him, did not seem like the Addy he knew. She never rushed into dangerous situations like that. She always had her head in a book. Not like that bothered him. He loved Adelaide just the way she was.Sitting back down at his desk, Charlie penned a quick letter to Adelaide requesting that she tell him what was going on with her. He made sure to mention that he was worried about her, but almost banished the ink thinking that his confession of worry would make her angry.At this rate, it probably did not matter much. She would probably never respond to his letter.“Charlie! You awake in there?” Hugo pounded his large feet up the staircase of Charlie’s cabin, looking for his friend.“Yeah, in here.” Charlie called out, sealing the envelope, and walking over to his window where his beautiful, brown owl named Clem – short for Clementine – stood perched tall and proud. A soft hoot escaped from Clem’s beak as Charlie handed her a soft treat, let her eat it, before he handed her the letter with a soft kiss to the top of her head.“Sending a letter back home?” Hugo stepped into the room, looking over to Charlie with a grin.“Yeah. A lot went down at the final task of the tournament. A kid died, Hugo. I mean… merlin…”Hugo let out a sigh, dropping a copy of the Daily Prophet down on Charlie’s desk. “Moira just came back from visiting her Mum. Grabbed us a few copies of this.” He gestured to the story about the tournament, Barty Crouch jr, and everything else that transpired on that fateful night on June 25th.  ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►►  J U L Y 1995, 12 G R I M M A U L D P L A C E“We’re going to need all the help we can get.”Remus stood tall at the head of the dusty table stationed in the dimly-lit room of 12 Grimmauld Place. His fingers tightly latched onto the back of the chair he was standing behind.“And where do you expect we get the help?” Adelaide Corden was perched beside Sirius, her blonde hair tied in a tight bun at the nap of her neck. Her blue eyes scanned the rest of the room.It was quite bare – at least for right now. The only people here, at the moment, were Adelaide, Remus, Sirius, Tonks, and Arthur Weasley. Molly and Arthur had already planned on moving in for the time-being, with their children.“We can ask my son. He may have connections.” Arthur spoke up with a smile.“Bill?” Adelaide raised an eyebrow, glancing over to the other red head.“Charlie, actually.”It was in that moment that Adelaide’s eyes glazed over. Her brain went haywire. She had not been in the same room as Charlie Weasley in over four years. She would rather be consumed by an explosion of wildfire than see him again.She was brought back to the present by Sirius’ hand grasping her thigh beneath the table. Blinking a few times, Adelaide cleared her throat and looked over to the man beside her. She slipped her hand over his and forced a smile.“I’ll travel over to Romania myself. It’ll be quicker that way.” Arthur spoke up again, glancing warily over to Adelaide before turning to Remus at the head of the table.“Very well.” Remus nodded.“Bloody hell, I’ve got to go. I’m supposed to meet Moody for training.” Tonks pushed herself up from the table. The metamorphagus was certainly not graceful, the chair tipped back too far and knocked against the floor harshly.“The marble flooring, Dora!” Sirius cried dramatically, removing his hand from Adelaide’s thigh to stand up and lift the chair up for his cousin.“Sorry.” Tonks chuckled, her cheeks turning a bit red as she felt Remus’ gaze on her. Adelaide assumed the embarrassment of being a klutz in front of Remus was the reason she did not correct Sirius when he called her Dora.“See you later, Tonks.” Adelaide grinned to her friend, bidding her farewell with a wink and a wave before the pink-haired witch sauntered out of the room as quick, and safe, as possible.Once Tonks was gone, Arthur continued with the discussion. “Am I to understand that we’re getting the order back together?”“The order?” Adelaide raised a brow, unfamiliar with the group Arthur was referencing to. She glanced over to Sirius, who was now walking over to the bar in the corner of the room.“The Order of the Phoenix.” Remus spoke up with a proud smile. “Dumbledore put this secret order in place during the initial rise of the Dark Lord.”“He actually brought us in during our last year at Hogwarts.” Sirius cut in with a sad sigh. He sat back down beside Adelaide at the table and handed her a picture. “This was the order.” He told her, a smile forming on his lips as he started pointing out everyone in the photo.“Bloody hell, Harry is the spitting image of his father.” She breathed out, holding onto the photograph as she watched Sirius point to each person and provide the name.“Arthur,” She giggled softly, looking up at him. “You haven’t aged a day.”Arthur blushed, grinning down at the healer before shaking his head. “You’re too kind, Addy.”“Hey now!” Sirius exclaimed, snatching the photo back as he peered down at it. “What about me, love?”Adelaide giggled, “Stop it.” She smacked his chest with the back of her hand before looking back at Arthur as he spoke up.“Molly’s got dinner on the stove, I should get going. We’ll be in touch.” ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► A week had gone by since the meeting between them all. Dumbledore had been in touch with Sirius, keeping him up to date about what will be happening shortly with The Order. Kingsley Shacklebolt, Severus Snape, Alastor Moody were also members – just to name a few.Adelaide’s parent wanted to be a part of this but chose to remain a bit removed from the meetings and would do what they could within the Ministry – where they both worked.“Ginny Weasley!” Adelaide exclaimed, tripping up the stairs over a pair of sneakers that belonged to the youngest Weasley sibling.“Sorry…” Ginny blushed, rushing down the steps and picking up the shoes as she looked down at Adelaide with a sly smirk. “There’s just so many stairs.”“And what?” Adelaide could not help but laugh, “You thought nobody would notice, or trip, over them?”“Uh, yeah, something like that.” Ginny’s cheeks were still red as she spun around on her heels and rushed back up the steps to the bedroom.Molly, Arthur and the rest of the Weasley clan had officially moved into number twelve Grimmauld Place the night before. Adelaide, too, had moved most of her things in – but for different…obvious reasons.Sirius liked having her close, whenever she was not at work, at least. Adelaide definitely did not mind the pampering from Sirius. It was really the first time in her life someone was putting her needs before their own. She found herself thinking about him all the time, even when they were together. She was starting to get worried about Arthur bringing Charlie in. Would he even come? That was the million-dollar question.“Addy, love, are you getting ready for work?” Sirius peered up from behind his thin-rimmed glasses, a small smile appearing on her lips as he watched the blonde slowly saunter her way into the library and drop into a chair by the unlit fireplace.She was dressed in her uniform – thing white stockings that stopped midthigh. Her cotton dress, zipped all the way up the back, ended just above the tops of her stockings. A small slither of skin was on display and as she stretched upwards, more of her bare thigh started to show.“Because if you keep doing that,” He continued, putting his glasses on the table before him before making sure to mark the page of the book he was checked out. “You’re going to end up being late.”He made his way towards her and slowly dropped before her, between her legs. His hands found their way to the sides of her thighs as he then rested his head in her lap.“You’re bad.” Adelaide giggled softly, reaching down to run her fingers through his hair. Aimlessly brushing the curled strands away from his forehead, Adelaide started scraping her nails against his scalp, almost massaging him, and keeping him close.“You love it, though.” Sirius teased, lifting his head, and looking up to Adelaide. He knew she was worried about being around Charlie. To be quite honest, Sirius was worried too. Worried about having to become second in Adelaide’s life. She had so much history with Charlie and no matter how much she said she was angry with him – Sirius knew she still loved him.Maybe he should change his mind about not putting a label on whatever it was that was happening between them.“Hmm,” Adelaide smiled, leaning forward to press her lips against his. Her hands moved to cup either side of his face as she let the kiss deepen just a bit before pulling away. “I do.” She brushed the tip of her nose against his before pecking his lips softly. “And you.”Sirius froze, pulling back just a bit as he looked to her. “Me?”Adelaide was worried maybe she should not have said anything. Moving to pull him up as she stood, her fingers laced tightly with his as she stood before him. She stood on the tips of her toes, kissing his lips again.“Yes. I love you.”Sirius let go of her hands and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her tight against him as he dove back down to kiss her lips again. He was still smiling throughout the kiss before he let his tongue dart out to push against her lips, parting them and deepening the kiss in their passionate embrace.“I love you, too. Adelaide Corden, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever met.” Sirius whispered to her, moving one hand to rest against her chest, “Inside. And out.” He told her.A smile was forming on his lips again as he pressed is forehead against her own, letting his eyes stare down into hers.“Now I’m really going to be late.” She whispered up to him, breaking eye contact for a moment to look at the grandfather clock nestled by the library door.“I’ll make sure to wake you up when I get home.” She teased, pecking his lips quickly before she pulled away from him.“Have a nice day at work, love.” Sirius called after her, giving her a little wave as she walked out of the room to head to the sitting room to take the floo to work. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► Once her shift at St. Mungos was officially over, Adelaide took her time in exiting the employee lounge with her belongings. It was a rough shift with a lot of emergencies occurring, and Adelaide found herself mentally and physically exhausted.She made sure to gather her things in her bag, knowing she had the next few days off from work was certainly the light at the end of the tunnel.“Have a nice night, Rose.” Adelaide gave a soft wave and smile to the woman at the front desk before she grabbed some floo powder and threw it down to the ground in the fireplace, softly calling out her destination.As she stepped out of the green flames, Adelaide moved to toss her bag down on the sofa before slipping the hat from her head and gently setting it down on top of her bag.She decided it was time for a drink and quietly walked over to the bar to pour herself a glass of brandy.The house was quiet, and she assumed – due to the time of night – everyone was in bed. Hearing footsteps coming up behind her, Adelaide smiled softly.“I thought you’d be in bed, Siri.” She giggled, taking a sip of the brandy before setting the glass down and pouring him a glass so that they could cuddle on the couch and enjoy the liquor together.At the unwelcomed silence, Adelaide cleared her throat and started turning to look over her shoulder. “What’s wrong? Cat got your tongue?” She teased, finally turning around completely.The man standing behind her was not Sirius. She almost dropped the glass in her hand out of sheer shock, and confusion, before quickly setting it down as she held onto the counter.“Hi Addy.”   

“I don’t know how we got to where we areSo far removed I don’t know where to start” His voice was just as smooth as she remembered it. Her name on his tongue sounded wrong. The anger, and betrayal started bubbling up inside of her again. Clutching tightly to the glass, Adelaide turned back around and downed the brandy in one large gulp.“You’re not going to speak to me?”Adelaide set the glass down, reaching over the bar and down to grab the bottle of brandy. Skipping the glass this time around, the blonde screwed off the lip and took another swig straight from the bottle.“Addy, please.”“No.” She finally spoke up, hissing out her response to the man who started walking closer to her. She spun around, still clutching the bottle. “How dare you. How dare you show up here and just…” She sucked in a deep breath, “How can you just say hi as if we haven’t seen one another since you left me asleep, and not to mention drunk, in your bed?”Charlie stood frozen beside her now. Having taller legs than her, he could take larger strides in a short amount of time. He snatched the bottle of liquor from her hand and set it down on the bar.“Addy, I’m sorry. I have apologized to you so many times. You barely responded to any of my letters.” The red head spoke lowly, not wanting to wake up anyone else in the house. Especially not his family.“Your apologies mean nothing to me, Charlie.” Adelaide was basically whispering now. She refused to make eye contact. Her arms crossed tightly over her chest as she stared down at the floor between them.“Addy, please.” Charlie pleaded with a sigh. “Do you know why I came here?”Adelaide rolled her eyes and slowly looked up to him. “Why did you come here?”Stepping closer, Charlie reached forward and rested one hand on the side of her face. “For you.” He told her, a sad smile appearing on his lips now. “For Tonks. For my family. For Harry.” He continued, letting out a sigh.Adelaide stepped back, forcing Charlie’s hand to drop from her face. She did not like the feeling his touch provided her. Deep in the pit of her stomach the butterflies started to rise again. A feeling she had not been familiar with in quite a long time.“I just want my best friend back, Addy. Please.” Charlie sighed again.“It’s going to take some time, Charlie. I can’t just go back to acting like you didn’t break my heart.” She admitted, chewing on her bottom lip for a moment before she looked up at him.Charlie knew what he did was messed up. He was a sodding idiot – he knew that, too.“I know. I’m sorry.” He repeated, giving the healer a solemn nod. “So, you thought I was Sirius Black, huh?”Adelaide raised a brow, watching Charlie before she turned back to the bar. She poured more brandy in the glass and took a small sip.“And what of it?”Charlie chuckled, “Nothing, nothing. No, I was just… You know, I just want you to be happy. Met him this afternoon when I got in with dad.”Adelaide smiled softly, “Yeah?” She glanced over at him for a moment. He looked so much older since the last time she saw his face so close. As much as she truly missed him, her first best friend (minus Tonks), she was still angry at him. She should not care about what he thinks of Sirius, or what Sirius thinks of him. But she could not help herself for feeling curious.“How did it go?” ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► A few hours earlier…

“Oh! Charlie!” Molly exclaimed as her second eldest son stepped out from the green flames. Both of his hands holding suitcases and coming in quick behind him was Arthur, two more suitcases in hand. Charlie had planned on staying a while – atleast until they figured out a solid plan for The Order.“Hiya Mum.” Charlie blushed from embarrassment as Molly flagged him down with a tight hug, smothering his face with kisses before she let him go.“I’m so happy that you agreed to come. It’ll be so nice to have everyone in one place for once.” Molly sighed happily, stepping aside to greet her husband.The twins, Ron, and Ginny stepped forward to greet their big brother before they hurried off to the dining room for lunch.Remus stepped forward, shaking Charlie’s hand. “Remus Lupin. Nice to finally meet you, Charlie.”Charlie smiled in greeting, shaking Remus’ hand in return. “Thanks Remus. It’s nice to finally meet you, as well. Addy has written me quite a lot about you.”“Good things, I hope.” Remus joked with a chuckle. He went to grab Charlie’s bag to show him to his room before Sirius stepped in, clearing his throat.“Sirius Black.” He held his hand out to Charlie with a nod. “Welcome to my home.”Charlie shook his head hesitantly before meeting Sirius halfway and shaking his hand. “Charlie Weasley. Though I’m sure Addy has told you all about me.”Sirius pulled back, aimlessly fixing the collar of his shirt. “No. Not really.” He shrugged his shoulders, turning a bit to head towards Fred and George who were seated in the corner of the room playing a game of exploding snap.Charlie stood in silence. He wasn’t sure if he was just shocked that Sirius would answer him so rudely or the fact that Adelaide did not talk about him. Or maybe he was just trying to get a rise out of him?“Don’t listen to him too much. He’s in one of his moods.” Remus muttered beneath his breath, a grin appearing on his lips as he grabbed two of the suitcases and offered for Charlie to follow him out of the room and up the staircase to his room. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► “’Cause I’ve been away for far too longBut I implore you please hold on, I beg you please hold on”  Adelaide couldn’t help but laugh at Charlie’s retelling of his arrival at 12 Grimmauld Place.“Well, he knows you hurt me.” She stated bluntly.It’s not like she really wanted to hurt him. Ok…she wanted to hurt him. But just a bit. A teeny tiny bit. She knew it was childish. She just could not help herself.“I’m never going to hear the end of this, am I?”“Nope.” Adelaide shook her head and filled the glass up again before she moved to the sofa. She collapsed with a tired sigh.“Alright, well, I guess I deserve that.” Charlie sighed, grabbing the other glass and sitting down beside her.“So,” He began again, taking a sip and looking over at Adelaide with a frown. “You were there that night? At the Tournament?”Adelaide nodded, “Yeah. It was terrifying.” She shuddered at the thought.They sat in some more silence, drinking the alcohol cold in their hands before Adelaide opened up about what she witnessed the night of June 25th.Charlie remained quiet, listening intently to Adelaide’s story. That was one thing he was always good at. He was a good listener.“Do you believe that he’s back?” Adelaide leaned back into the sofa, watching Charlie rest his eyes.“I believe in Harry. So, if he says that the Dark Lord is back, then yes. Yes, I believe that he’s back.” Charlie sighed, his arms crossing over his chest as he shifted to get a bit more comfortable.“Sorry. I had to ask. There are a lot of people that don’t believe him.” Adelaide sighed, shaking her head before she grabbed their empty glasses and dropped them off in the sink that was behind the bar.“I’ve got to get to bed. I’m exhausted.” Adelaide leaned down, untied her shoes, and slipped her feet from them. The soles on them had a way of squeaking loudly anytime she tried to tiptoe up the staircase. She did not want to wake everyone.A part of her could sense that someone was lingering in the hallway upstairs but she chose to ignore it – atleast for right now.Charlie moved to stand up and walk towards her. “See you in the morning?” He sounded hopeful.It pained Adelaide to be so cruel to him (when in reality she could definitely be worse) but she would never forgive herself forgiving him right away.“Yeah, I-uh, I’m supposed to be working with Remus on some defensive spells. You’re welcome to join us, if you’d like.”“That sounds lovely. Goodnight Addy.” Charlie moved to walk past Adelaide, letting his hand rest on her forearm for a moment before giving her a nod and heading up the stairs towards his bedroom.“Goodnight Charlie.”Adelaide held onto her shoes as she followed him up the stairs, and quietly opened up Sirius’ door before shutting it behind her.“Hi Sirius.” She whispered, a small smile appearing on her lips as she looked over to the bed, seeing the man resting up against the headboard with a book casually in his hands.He looked up with a soft smile, “How was the reunion?”The healer ignored the sadness laced in his words and tossed her shoes with a loud clunk before she unzipped her dress and shimmied out of it. Crawling onto the bed, she pulled the blankets over her before snuggling into his side with a sigh.“Don’t be like that.” She whispered, glancing up at him, letting her hand rest on his stomach beside her head as she curled into him. Her fingers started tracing the runes inked into the skin across his chest and sternum.“I’m only asking,” Sirius let out a soft gasp at the soft feeling of her fingers against his sensitive skin. “Because I care about you. And I want you to be alright.”Adelaide smiled softly, biting her lower lip into her mouth before she looked up at him. “It went just as well as I imagined it would.” She admitted with a sigh. “Not great. Certainly not even good. But I think I could forgive him in time. If he can be of any help to us against the Dark Lord, he should be here.” She let her hand now come to rest on his chest. She pushed against him and shifted herself up more so she could press her lips against his softly.“To be quite honest, Sirius,” Adelaide whispered, “I’m terrified. I never thought that my life would come to the worries of the Dark Lord and making sure everything I love remains safe…and alive.” Adelaide’s bottom lip started to quiver at the thought of losing her parents, her friends…him.“Harry is so lucky to have a brilliant witch, and healer, such as yourself in his corner.” Sirius told her, shifting slowly so he could push her onto her back. He hovered over her, either forearm pressing into the mattress as the tip of his nose brushed against hers.“You’re too kind to me, Sirius Black.” She whispered, letting her hands move to his sides, pulling him down into her.“Hmm, darling. I’ll keep being kind to you if you keep reacting this way.” The older man teased, letting his body weight rest between her legs before capturing her lips with his own.“You sly dog.” She teased, her arms now coming to wrap around his waist before she pressed her lips against his again.Since they first got together, Sirius really was not the only one that was insatiable. Adelaide found herself craving his touch every single night that she spent with him – which was really almost every single night.Her hands traveled down to his hips and before he could protest – which, honestly, he would not be doing – she unbuckled his belt, undid the button and zipper on his trousers, and had pushed everything down past his hips, shifting as far as she could go to remove them completely.Sirius shimmied his hips and then his legs, kicking his trousers and boxers off before his hips found their way against Adelaide’s again. His lips captured hers in a delicate embrace, his forearms still pressing into the mattress on either side of her head, being careful not to pull at the loose strands of her hair that was sprawled out around her, almost in the form of a halo around her head.Adelaide deepened the kiss, relishing in the pressure his body provided hers before she shimmied herself out of her underwear, letting the flimsy material bunch up around her ankles, kicking it towards the end of the bed before she parted her legs and hooked them around his waist.As Adelaide traced her fingers along Sirius’ sides, he positioned him appropriately between her legs before pressing himself deep inside of her.A low moan escape Adelaide’s lips as she squeezed her eyes shut and threw her head back into the pillow beneath her. She shifted her hips up, grinding herself into Sirius to help with accommodating his size. Her hands moved from his sides to his face, gently cupping his cheeks as she opened her eyes to look up at him.“Godric, I love you.” She told him.Sirius lowered himself more, his hands linking together at the top of her head as his arms cradled closer to her head. He began moving his hips slowly, almost teasingly, before his lips found hers.“And I you.” He whispered with a moan of his own, his forehead resting against hers for a moment before he began moving his hips at a faster rate. The feeling was indescribable – and Sirius really didn’t think it was just because it had been so long since he had gotten laid – being in Azkaban and all.The rest of their time beneath the sheets was silent – with the exception of the moans and heavy breathing escaping both of their mouths when they were locked in a heated kiss. Sirius was a very attentive lover, and all he wanted was for Adelaide to feel good. He wanted her to feel loved. The reason was simple. It was because she was. She was loved. Tremendously.Sirius grew up never knowing what love was, other than platonic love between himself, Remus, James and Peter. He had never found the missing piece of his puzzle – atleast not until last year. Adelaide Corden was that missing piece for him. She brightened up the dark and dreary rooms of 12 Grimmauld Place, just by walking through the hallways.The magic between them was constantly crackling under the heat. Sirius could feel her magic swirling around his own just by laying in the same bed as her. Godric, it was even better when he was bottomed out inside of her, her inner walls clenched down around him as waves of pleasure washing over her as she orgasmed.Sirius was soon to follow with his own orgasm. Seeing his partner in the state of euphoria that he helped her build was a major turn on. His eyes clenched shut as his face pressed into the crook of her neck. His hips continued moving as he felt himself empty out within in. Stilling his hips as he felt his orgasm finish, Sirius moved to start planting kisses along the column of Adelaide’s neck.He waited another moment or so before slowly pulling out and shifting to lay his head down onto her chest as his body curled into hers on the side. Coming down from the carnal high with Adelaide was one of his favorite things to do. And it was not just because he had just successfully gotten his rocks off – the intimacy between them was extremely important to him.He never liked being vulnerable. He never felt safe as a kid, or even as a teenager, when he was vulnerable. The sound of his lovers heart slowly starting to climb back down into the normal range was all Sirius could hear as his head stayed put right above her ribcage.“I hate to be a buzzkill,” Adelaide giggled softly, her cheeks still flushed as she shifted a bit to look down at him. “But you didn’t use the bloody charm.” She told him, a soft sigh escaping her lips. “Which means, I’m going to have to go to Hogsmeade to the apothecary…” She glared at him for a moment.She knew the contraceptive charm, as well as the morning after potion, were not completely effective, but she had never had an issue with either form of birth control before so she would continue utilizing them until she didn’t need to anymore.To be honest, that was something that they had found themselves talking about most recently. Was this serious? Did Sirius, once his name was cleared, want kids? Marriage? Were they going to survive this war? Adelaide found herself getting emotional just thinking about it. She wasn’t sure what she would do if she lost any of her loved ones to the Dark Lord. She didn’t want to think about it.Sirius groaned, rolling over onto his back and covered his face with both hands. “I’m sorry, love… Heat of the moment and all that…” He quickly came up with an excuse, glancing through his fingers at the blonde healer who was now curled up on her side, glaring at him.“I’ll go with you. As Padfoot, I mean.” He offered sheepishly.“No. Absolutely not. I cannot have you being found out.” Adelaide shook her head profusely. “I’ll owl Tonks in the morning. She might be able to meet me out there on her lunch break. Give her something to look forward to, instead of staring at Moody’s glass eye all day.”Sirius laughed softly. He sat up on the edge of the bed, grabbing his boxers and tugging them back on as he stood up. He grabbed Adelaide’s underwear and playfully flung them back at her before waltzing into the bathroom.Once he was washed up and ready for bed, Adelaide entered the bathroom to do the same. She had taken a bit more time, as there was some more washing up for her to do after their little romp, and as she walked back out she saw that Sirius had already fallen asleep.“What an old man.” She rolled her eyes with a giggle. On the route from the bathroom to the bed she had grabbed an older t-shirt from Sirius’ collection and tugged it on over her bare chest before crawling under the sheets and curling up to Sirius’ side.So what if Charlie was back in her life. So what if she still got those little butterflies when he said her name. Sirius gave her even bigger butterflies. That had to mean something.Right? ”Could you tell me is it all a waste of time?Are you leaving my love behind?Baby say the word and let me go…”

The next morning, not too long after the sun started to rise in the misty summer sky, Adelaide found herself scribbling a quick note to Tonks requesting her to meet at Hogsmeade for lunch.The healer soon moved to the kitchen, preparing some tea and coffee knowing that everyone in the house had their own preferences. She had a small notepad with her, writing down things she would need to pick up. Molly, who was also an early riser, shuffled into the kitchen still wiping sleep from her eyes.“Oh, morning Adelaide.” Molly sighed happily, pecking the girl on the cheek in greeting. “How was work?”Adelaide smiled. “It was alright. Quite busy, a bit too busy for my liking. I’m glad to be off for a few days.” She admitted with a chuckle. “I’m going to make a run to Hogsmeade for a…uh, few supplies.” She cleared her throat a bit, reaching over to wand, flicking it behind her to magically whip up her cup of coffee just how she liked it.“Is there anything you would like for me to pick up?” The blonde tucked a few strands of hair behind her ears as she tucked her wand into the back pocket of her loose-fitting jeans.Molly smiled. “Actually, yes. There’s quite a few things I could use here in the kitchen. If you don’t mind, that is.”Adelaide shook her head, “No, of course not.”Molly smiled, nodding to Adelaide as she stepped up beside her to scribble a few items she needed.“Bezoar?” Adelaide peered over Molly’s shoulder as she watched her write what she needed. Adelaide recognized this ingredient instantly – typically used in antidotes for most poisons. The healer tried to ignore the sinking feeling in her stomach at the new reality for everyone in the wizarding world.“I’m not too good at potions, Addy dear,” Molly sighed, “But I have a feeling we may need a few things lying around the house to be safe.”Adelaide nodded in agreement. “Not to toot my own horn, but-““Addy is bloody brilliant in potions.”Charlie walked through the doorway, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as he snagged the floating cup of tea that was lingering a few inches above the countertop.Adelaide smiled out of embarrassment. “Right.” She cleared her throat a bit, sipping her coffee before looking over at Charlie for a quick moment.“Nothing to be ashamed of, dear! After all, you are a brilliant healer. It makes sense that you are skilled with potion making.” Molly smiled, finishing up her list before sliding the paper and quill back to Adelaide before picking up a cup of tea for herself and quickly shuffling out of the room – leaving Adelaide alone with Charlie.“Ah, Addy, this came for you.” Charlie reached into his back pocket and handed over a letter. “I just sent an owl to Hugo so I was there when it was delivered.”“Hugo?”“Ah, my boss. A friend, too.” Charlie smiled softly, sipping at the tea for a moment before leaning against the counter beside Adelaide.Adelaide took another sip of her coffee and scribbled a few more things on her list before opening the letter.“Fuck,” She muttered to herself, a soft groan escaping her lips before she tossed the letter in the trash.“Who was that from?” Charlie could not help but be a bit nosey.“Tonks.” Adelaide responded flatly. She really did not want to go into Hogsmeade alone and since Tonks explained that Moody was being an absolute tosser and took away her lunch break for breaking his favorite paperweight. Adelaide found herself wondering by he even needed a paperweight when he could have just used magic.Shaking her head to rid herself of the thought, she turned and started speaking again. “I asked her to meet me in Hogsmeade since I’ve got some shopping to do. Moody’s got her locked in a tight schedule, so it looks like it’ll just be me.”Charlie shook his head. “Oh, uh, well…” Now was his chance. He could get more alone time with Adelaide. They could act just like old times.“I could go with you. Provide some company. You know, so you aren’t alone.” He offered.Adelaide chewed on her bottom lip and looked down at her list before folding it twice over and tucking it into her pocket.“I think that’s a wonderful idea.”Glancing up at the familiar voice, Adelaide rolled her eyes playfully. Luckily, Charlie had turned to look and missed her reaction.“Good Morning, love.” Adelaide walked past Charlie and pressed her lips against Sirius’. “You’re up early.” She whispered, wrapping her arms around his waist as she leaned into his side.Sirius grinned, wrapping one arm around her shoulders to keep her pulled into his side while his other hand reached over to grab her coffee and take a sip of it himself.“You know I don’t like an empty bed.” He purred down to her with a smirk.Well, now he was just being foolish, but Adelaide giggled and that sound was like music to his ears.Charlie felt a bit more than slightly uncomfortable as he watched the scene before him unfold. Adelaide had boyfriends throughout their time at Hogwarts, but this seemed to be her first serious adult relationship (atleast with him being around). With a man much older than her to top it all off.“Like I said,” Sirius continued, “I think it’s a good idea.” He glanced over at Charlie, handing Adelaide her mug back. “You guys can catch up. And I would prefer for Adelaide to have someone with her just in case something happens.”“You know, I can very well take bloody care of myself Sirius Black!” Adelaide glared at him, pulling herself away as she finished the coffee and placed the mug in the empty sink.“We all know you can take care of yourself, Addy.” Charlie chuckled, “After all, Dad wrote me and told me how you chased after Harry and imposter Moody.” He raised a brow, watching the girl walk back to Sirius and wrap her arms around him again.“That was nothing. You should have seen her in action with us in the Shrieking Shack.” Sirius grinned madly, peering down at Adelaide. A look of admiration glazed over his eyes as he leaned down to press his lips against her forehead lovingly. “She is a bloody brilliant witch.”Charlie smiled. “That she is.” He finished his tea and placed the mug in the sink. “Let me go get changed and I’ll meet you by the fireplace.” He nodded to Sirius and Adelaide before walking off towards the staircase.“That was nice of you.” Adelaide whispered under her breath, resting her chin against Sirius’ chest as she looked up at him through her thick, dark lashes.“A good night’s rest, among other things-“ He reached down and playfully squeezed her backside, pulling her into him as he did so. “Helped me realize that jealousy does not look good on me.”“Hmm, I wonder what those other things were.” Adelaide teased, a giggle escaping her lips as he squeezed her backside again. Her lips found his as she wound her arms around his neck.“I love you.”Sirius smiled against her lips, shifting his hands to either side of her face as he turned them around to press her into the counter behind them. “I love you, too. And one day,” he pulled back from the kiss to look into her eyes, “I promise that I will make an honest woman out of you. When this is all done. When the Dark Lord is finally gone for good. I promise.”Adelaide couldn’t help the blush rising quickly upon her cheeks. She found herself leaning up on the tips of her toes as her lips found his again. This kiss was different than a lot of the others. It was passionate and deep, but slow and meticulous. Her tongue brushed against his lower lip and silently asked for entrance to his mouth. When his lips parted, giving her permission, Adelaide found herself tasting him – the subtle hint of coffee lingering on his tongue from when he had taken a sip from her mug not too long ago.She had been too sucked into the embrace to notice the silent, sad eyes watching from the doorway.Charlie had heard it all. Sirius’ confession of promising a better life – marriage. Charlie was not sure what it was… the twisted feeling festering deep in his stomach. It was not a good feeling, and he felt lucky to have not eaten anything yet because it would have most likely come right back up.He should be happy for his best friend. He knew that. But he also knew that if things had gone differently all those years ago – it may very well have been him standing there with her, promising marriage. Promising a happy life after being torn apart by war.“I’ll see you when you get back.” Sirius whispered against her lips, his hands finding their way to her hips as he started pulling back from Adelaide.“I’ll pick you up a treat if you promise to behave.” She teased, pecking his lips quickly before slipping from his grasp. She heard footsteps in the corridor and assumed that was Charlie coming down the steps and walking into the sitting room.“I always behave!” Sirius called after her with a laugh.Adelaide found herself smirking, reaching over to the coatrack to grab her bag, which luckily was still charmed with an undetectable expansion charm.“Ready?” She looked up to find Charlie leaned against the wall by the fireplace.“Ready when you are.” He responded with a nod.“It’s still a bit early. We can floo to the Three Broomsticks. Madam Rosmerta is usually open early in the summer months. We can grab a bite to eat if you would like. Dogweed and Deathcap won’t open for another hour and most of what I need can be found in there.” Adelaide rambled on, clearing her throat as she glanced over at Charlie again.“Sure, that sounds fine.” He nodded with a small smile, reaching over and above Adelaide’s head to snatch a bit of the floo powder. He tossed it down, stepped inside and called out for The Three Broomsticks.Adelaide followed after Charlie, dusting herself off as she stepped out onto the creaky wooden floorboards of the Three Broomsticks. Charlie was already leaning against a table, talking up Madam Rosmerta by the time Adelaide was able to catch up to him.The two old friends grabbed a table by the window and before Adelaide could even blink, Madam Rosmerta was placing glasses of water in front of them.“I can whip up some breakfast for you two. Eggs, toast, bacon?” Madam Rosmerta glanced between the two, waiting their response.Adelaide smiled and nodded, “Sounds perfect.”Charlie agreed, “Thank you Rosmerta.”“Glad to see you back home, Mr. Weasley.” Rosmerta smiled down at Charlie before she shuffled over to another table that had some of her usual patrons to check on them.Adelaide checked the time and took in a deep breath. She was nervous – was it weird sharing a meal with the man who broke her heart and thought nothing of it? Was she just being dramatic?“So, uh, “ Charlie cleared his throat and took a sip of water, “How is work going for you? St. Mungos must keep you quite busy.”“Very busy, actually. But I love it. They have me shuffling around to the different floors each shift, so it truly is always something new each time I go back in. I’m not sure what my favorite area to work in is, though. I’m sure I’ll figure it out.” Adelaide smiled, playing with the dainty silver chain that was laying loose around her neck. This had been something that Sirius found in one of the many, many rooms of Grimmauld Place. It had belonged to him when he was a teenager – one of the pieces of jewelry he had never been able to take with him when he escaped the abusive clutches of his family.“What about you?” Adelaide found herself asking Charlie about his work with the dragons. She was curious, of course. Really…she was!“The dragons are bloody amazing, Addy.” The redhead whispered, a smile forming on his lips as he looked up to thank Rosmerta for bringing them two plates of food.Charlie went into further detail about the dragons, the kinds they worked with, what his typical day looked like. Adelaide found herself forgetting about the resentment she had for him and the dragons, asking him questions about anything she could think of.They shared the meal, laughing like old times, and before long Adelaide allowed Charlie to pay for their meal before walking outside before him. A soft sigh escaped her lips as she took in a breath of fresh air.“Where to first?” Charlie tucked his hands in his pockets, stepping up beside Adelaide as he did so.“I’ve got to grab something from Krashel’s Apothecary.” She told him, hoping he would not ask questions. Luckily, he did not.Charlie nodded and followed Adelaide, taking in his surroundings with a smile. “I’ve missed it here. Not the weather, as much… Romania is nice and sunny.”Adelaide laughed softly, “Well, the sun is out today! It’s just… more than likely a bit hazy so it doesn’t really matter if the sun is out or not.” She admitted, shrugging her shoulders as she reached forward to grab the door.Charlie beat her to it. He opened the door to the apothecary, bowing slightly as he gestured for her to walk in before him.“Thank you.” She told him with a nod, playing with the strap across her shoulder before she glanced around to get her bearings. Figuring out where she needed to get to, without another word to Charlie in hopes that he would look around himself and not follow her, Adelaide moved to the back corner. Letting her eyes travel over the labels before she stood on her toes to reach the further left corner shelf. Grabbing a handful of the potion she needed, she turned and let out a soft gasp.Charlie was standing behind her, peering over her shoulder. Nosey bastard.“Charlie!” She sighed, clutching the bottles to her chest as she leaned against the shelf behind her.“You need to be more careful, Addy.” Charlie spoke softly, glancing at the bottles in her hands before looking to Adelaide, making eye contact with a frown.Ignoring his statement, Adelaide slipped past him and walked to the check out counter. The older gentleman, Mr. Alexander Krashel himself, smiled warmly down to her.“Will this be all for today?”“Yes, sir.” Adelaide nodded, reaching down into her bag, fishing around for a moment or two before she pulled out her wallet.“I don’t mean to intrude,” The man began, packing the vials in a safe container for travel as he looked between Charlie and Adelaide, “But there is stronger version of this potion.” He lowered his voice now, “Guaranteed to protect for three full days. It will be less on you, or your boyfriend heres wallet.”Adelaide blushed deeply at the insinuation that Charlie was her boyfriend. “Oh, Mr. Krashel, uh-“ She cleared her throat. “Thank you for the information. We’re not…together. No. Oh, uh, sorry. Too much information to share, I guess.” She shook her head with a sigh. “That will be all for today. But I’ll keep that information in mind. Thank you.”She needed to get out of there. This was incredibly embarrassing for her. First, Charlie saw what she was buying. Telling her to be careful. Pfft. The nerve of that man. Second, the man behind the counter thought it was normal to start a conversation with a total stranger about contraceptive potions, making assumptions of her relationship.Adelaide was always an extremely private person. She looked back at Charlie for a moment. Once their eyes met, she turned back around, paid the man what she owed, and took the bag before rushing through the closest aisle to the checkout counter and out the door.“Addy! Wait!” Charlie called out after her. The streets of Hogsmeade were a bit more crowded now that many of the stores were now open. He weaved around a family of five, sending apologies over his shoulder as he finally caught up to Adelaide.He caught the tail end of her swigging one serving of the emergency contraceptive potion before tossing the glass vial into the trash receptacle on the corner.“What? What Charlie?” She snapped, tossing the bag from the apothecary into her extended purse before tossing the strap right back over her shoulder. She crossed her arms over her chest and stared up at the redhead standing before her.“You need to relax. Everything is…fine. I’m not judging you, if that’s what you think.”Adelaide rolled her eyes. “Likely story, Charles Weasley. I know you, remember?” She glared for a moment before spinning on her heels and started off towards Dogweed and Deathcap.Charlie groaned out of frustration. Rushing after the feisty healer once more, he found himself reaching forward and grabbing onto her elbow.“Stop. Running. Away. From. Me.” He growled down at her, narrowing his eyes as he watched her stop trying to pull away from him.He tugged her closer to him, moving towards the closest alleyway. “Listen to me, Adelaide.” Charlie sighed, letting go of her elbow before crossing his arms over his chest as he looked down at her. “You need to stop acting like this. I am your best friend, I’m here for you. I lo-““No.” She shoved his chest as hard as she could with both hands – which was not that hard. “You are not my best friend. Not anymore.”“Alright, I deserve that.”Adelaide rolled her eyes, leaning back against the wall for support. “You deserve far worse than what I just said to you, Charlie. You…” She trailed off. She was having a hard time coming up with the right way to tell hm off.“You broke my heart.” She whispered, looking down at her feet. She was scared to look at him. Admitting that heartache directly to the culprit was much harder than she thought it would be.“Adelaide, I never… I never meant to do that.” Charlie stepped forward, closing more of the distance between them. He reached forward and cupped the side of her face in his hand.Adelaide tried to swallow down the butterflies and the memory of how good it felt to be this close to him.“But you did.” She reared her head to the side, pulling away from his grip. “You did do that.”“Look, I’m trying to make it up to you. I’ve been trying show you that I care. It’s not fair, Addy. I left because I needed to. My life was no longer here… My life was in Romania. Is in Romania.”“Then go home.”Adelaide stood her ground, crossing her arms tight, almost hugging herself as she stared up at Charlie. She knew she was being far too bull-headed about this. Tonks had been telling her for over a year that she needed to get over it and forgive Charlie. She hated to admit it, but it was the first time she agreed with Tonks over something as serious as this.“Don’t do that.” Charlie pleaded, stepping forward again. “Please don’t do that. You are my best friend, no matter where I am, where I’m living, or where I’m working. I will always think of you as my best friend, Addy.”With his declaration, Charlie reached forward and cupped her cheeks in his hands. Without thinking too much about it, he leaned forward and pressed his lips against hers.The kiss was rough. Different from their first, and only other kiss from the night before he left school. Charlie really was not sure what had come over him. But here he was. Standing in a deserted alleyway in the middle of Hogsmeade, kissing his best friend – who was still angry at him for leaving and moving to Romania. Not to mention she was also in a relationship.Adelaide froze. She did not kiss him back. She just reached up and wrapped her fingers around his wrist, wrenching herself from his grasp.“Charlie! Stop! What the bloody hell is wrong with you?” She cried, pushing him further away.“I’m sorry.” He breathed out, wiping the back of his hand across his mouth. It wasn’t in disgust, per se. Most likely from the shock of his actions, really. “I-uh, I really don’t know what came over me. I think I just wanted you to shut up and stop arguing with me to be quite honest.”Adelaide rubbed her face with both hands, pressing her palms into her eyes before letting her hands hang by her sides. “Alright, well, let’s forget that happened. We have wasted enough time fighting. I’ve got to get these ingredients before they run out.”With that, she turned and rushed out of the alleyway and into the shop. Charlie followed silently; his shoulders hunched forward a bit as he did.Adelaide had picked up a basket, quickly turning and shoving it into Charlie’s chest. “Hold this for me.” She told him, not giving him an option to say yes or no. Obviously, she knew he would do just about anything she told him to at this point.She wandered the aisles, grabbing everything off her list and stuffed into the basket Charlie was now holding for her.There was one more ingredient – something particularly expensive and hard to come by – that she needed to find. She had asked the shopkeeper numerous times before about it and was hoping this time around he had some in stock in the back – just for her.“I’ll be right back.” She told Charlie, barely glancing over her shoulder at him as she mustered up the courage to walk to the gentleman behind the counter.“Ah, Ms. Corden.” He grinned down at the healer. “Pleasure seeing you again. I’m sure I know what you are looking for.”Adelaide nodded earnestly. “Malcolm, always a pleasure. I was hoping you had it in stock.”Charlie lingered in the back, eavesdropping in on the conversation Adelaide was having with the man behind the counter.Holding a finger up, Malcolm walked out from behind the counter and into the back of the storeroom. He must have been expecting her because he came back out quickly. Once back behind the counter, Malcolm gently placed the plant on the counter. The plant had dark green leaves and purple flowers attached at the top of the stem. Adelaide noticed Malcom was wearing gloves while handling the plant and she knew she would have to make sure to utilize gloves while brewing the potion.Charlie watched the interaction. He had always paid attention in herbology and knew that though Professor Sprout never had any on hand to show them, they read about the plant and it’s magical properties.Aconite.

Aconite.

Aconite?Charlie continued lingering in the background, his ears staying tuned up for anymore conversation between Adelaide and Malcolm.“Charlie?” Adelaide had turned to look at her friend with a small, forced smile.“Ready for me?” Charlie grinned. Adelaide nodded, gesturing with her hand for him to come over with the basket so she could check out. By the time Charlie made it to the countertop, the aconite plant was gone. Adelaide had most likely paid separately and tucked it safely away in her bag.As he stood in silence behind her, his gaze falling on the floor. He was trying to wrack his head around why Adelaide would need aconite. It was a dangerous, poisonous plant used to create the potion wolfsbane. Had his father told him about this? Who was the werewolf? Was he so far removed from everything happening at home that he really had no clue?Once Adelaide had paid for everything and safely put everything in her bag before walking back out onto the street with Charlie.“Ready to head home?” She looked up to the red head for a moment before glancing back ahead of them.“That place is not my home, Addy.” Charlie sighed. His hands stuffed deep into the pockets of his blue jeans as they continued walking.“You really don’t need to act like a child, Charlie.” Adelaide groaned, rolling her eyes before she gestured for them to sit down on an empty bench by the streetlamp.“Why did you need aconite?”Adelaide laughed, “I was wondering how long you would keep quiet on that. You were really never good at being sneaky, you know.” She took in a deep breath and looked over to him as he sat beside her.“It’s for Remus.” She told him flatly. “I’m surprised your father didn’t tell you. Snape outed him after everything that happened in the Shrieking Shack a year ago.”Charlie sighed. “He may have mentioned it. To be honest, all I could focus on what you and your role in the story.” He admitted with a laugh. “You have changed so much since we were together last, Addy… It’s like I don’t know you anymore.”Charlie knew that if that truly were the case – if Adelaide changed, became a new person – the reason he did not understand it was because he wasn’t there. Charlie made the decision to move away. Suddenly move away. He, too, had changed in the last few years.He seemed taller, but Adelaide knew he did not actually grow in height but in other ways.The muscles hidden beneath his clothes were worked on constantly day in and day out. He had been muscular from playing quidditch, sure, but there was something about taking care of dragons that really changed his body.“I’m not the only one who has changed, Charlie. I mean, really, everyone changes when they start to grow up, don’t you think?” Adelaide turned a bit on the bench, crossing her legs as she did so.“Yeah, you’re right.” Charlie agreed, chewing on his lower lip for a moment.Adelaide studied Charlie’s face. She felt as though that had changed the most for him. She could see that he was tired and refused to show it. She could only imagine how hard it was living and working on a dragon sanctuary. She chose to not tell him about what shape her boggart took hold of. The truth was that she was scared of dragons. Scared of them because they were the one thing that removed her best friend from her life. They were the reason he left her – his family and other friends, too. Scared of dragons because they had the ability to hurt her friend who was just doing his job in trying to protect and help them.“What?”Charlie’s voice brought Adelaide out of whatever trance she had fallen into. Blinking rapidly, she turned away with a blush rising on her cheeks. He had just caught her staring and she was beginning to think that she could not handle anymore embarrassment for the day, especially not after what happened in the apothecary.“Sorry, got lost in thought is all.” She told him with a laugh. She took in the busy sounds of Hogsmeade, a smile forming on her lips as she let her eyes travel around the street they were on. She enjoyed watching couples walk around holding hands, the families shopping together in the early summer morning.Everything and everyone seemed so normal. Her mind went dark, though. The Dark Lord had returned. Even if things felt normal, there was always going to be a slight metaphorical chill in the air. Adelaide was terrified of what the future would bring.“Can I ask you a question?”Charlie turned a bit inwards, looking over Adelaide as he waited her response.“Depends on what the question is.” Adelaide smirked, looking up at Charlie before glancing back out ahead of them. She truly did enjoy people watching. She would sit anywhere with Tonks and people watch most times after their weekly lunch date.“Is it serious?”Sighing softly, Adelaide began chewing on her bottom lip. She knew what he was asking about. A part of her was beginning to get ticked off that he thought he had the right to ask her such a personal question. He had no right to that part of her life. Another few moments passed by, and Adelaide continued to remain silent.“Addy?” Charlie prodded, nudging her with his elbow.“Yes.”Charlie sank further down at her response. “Yes what? Yes, it’s serious?”“Yes, Charlie. It’s serious.” Adelaide crossed her arms over her chest and glanced over at the redhead. “Why do you care about whether or not it’s serious?”“Don’t turn this into something that it’s not. I care about you, Addy. Forgive me for being concerned.” Charlie told her, rolling his eyes at the way she was glaring over at him.“I’m not turning this into…something.” She muttered, waving a hand around as she tried to think of the right words to say. “He is a good man. A very good man.”“We’ll see about that.” Charlie scoffed.“I’m sorry, what was that?” Adelaide turned even more, her knee slamming into Charlie’s as she spun around to stare at him. Ignoring the throbbing sensation from bone hitting against bone, Adelaide started whispering angrily to Charlie about her love of Sirius. She, of course, did not speak his actual name out loud. She could not be caught talking about Sirius Black in public. He was technically still in hiding after his escape – his name and reputation still tattered from taking the fall for the crimes Pettigrew committed.“Say his name.”“No.” Adelaide snapped, “Stop trying to get a rise out of me. You know that I can’t say his name. Not here.”“That’s what I’m trying to get you to understand, Addy. You must see that! He may never get his name cleared. So, what does that mean for you?”“It means that the future I’ve visualized for myself will now include him. That’s it. End of story.”Adelaide pushed herself up from the bench and tugged the straps of her purse up over her shoulder before walking through the crowd back towards The Three Broomsticks. She did not even bother looking back to make sure Charlie was following her – she knew he was. She could hear the stomping of his boots against the sidewalk behind her.She pulled the door open quickly, holding it open for a moment so Charlie could step through the threshold as well. She waved to Rosmerta, a small smile appearing on her lips as she did so, before she headed over to the fireplace and snagged some of the floo powder. She tossed it down, stepped in and called out her desired destination. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► A U G U S T 1995 In the few weeks that had taken place from her Hogsmeade trip with Charlie, Adelaide did what she could to keep her distance from the Weasley son. Sirius had surprised her with a brand new, top of the line cauldron and a room set up just for her to work on her potion making skills. She had thanked him in more ways than one that night.Currently, she was hidden away in the lab – Sirius had officially started calling it ‘the lab’ one night and the name just stuck. Her wand was stuck through the back of her hair that had been thrown up into a messy bun. Glasses hung low on the bride of her nose as she peered over the cauldron and inspected the color of the liquid inside.The liquid itself steadily remained a pearly white color. She had to let this settle for another five minutes before adding the aconite petals.Tugging on her gloves, Adelaide walked over to the other bench by the window. A soft sigh escaping her lips as she took one stem of aconite from the jar she was keeping them in. She started singing softly under her breath, pulling her wand from the bun before utilizing her magic to cut the petals from the plant.She turned for a moment, looking back at the clock.One more minute.She scooped up the petals and tossed them into a marble bowl. Crushing the petals to get the consistency they needed to be before adding to the cauldron, Adelaide continued singing as she stepped back up to her workstation.She added the petals slowly. The words leaving her lips ceased for the moment. She did not even realize she was beginning to hold her breath as she flicked her wand to the right slowly, silently wishing that this batch would be successful.A few clockwise swirls of the liquid more and a subtle blue smoke started to rise from the cauldron.“Merlin! I’ve got it!”A loud screech escaped Adelaide’s mouth. She started jumping up and down, her wand being tossed somewhere in the room – she would find it at some point.The brewing of wolfsbane was extremely challenging. Since coming back to Grimmauld Place with her first batch of aconite, Adelaide had failed miserably at every attempt of brewing the potion.She was too busy jumping up and down screaming for joy to notice the door flying open. Sirius had a look of bewilderment on his face as he stood in the doorway and watched Adelaide bounce around excitedly.“Sirius! Oh! I’ve got it! Look!” Adelaide grinned widely, rushing over to the man as she took his hands in hers and tugged him through the doorway to the cauldron.“Magnificent!” Still holding onto her hands, Sirius wrapped his arms around Adelaide from behind, pressing his lips against the crook of her neck. “You are incredible. I knew you could do it.” He whispered to her, pulling his hands from hers to turn her around, holding her close so she was no longer bouncing around with excitement.“Oh, I can’t wait to tell Remus!” Adelaide whispered softly, tears of relief flooding her vision before she pressed her face into Sirius’ chest, keeping herself against him.It killed her that Remus had to transform each full moon in such pain. She did not mind making him the salves for his new scars, but she was hoping she would not have to make as much of that if she could now successfully brew the wolfsbane potion for him instead.“He’s going to be very happy, Adelaide.” Sirius told her, his hands cradling her face now as he stared down at her. His thumbs reached up, brushing away the tears that streamed down her cheeks now. Sirius found himself wanting to show her how thankful for her he was. His hands shifted to run down the sides of her entire body, grasping her hips possessively before he picked her up in his arms. Instinctively, Adelaide wrapped her legs around his waist, holding onto him.“What are you doing?” She giggled, pressing her lips against his before pulling back to look down at him. Now that she was hoisted up in the air, her head was above his. Her hands ran through his hair, tugging at the curled tresses and pushing them back from his face.“What does it look like? I’m going to show you just how grateful I am for you being the brilliant potioneer that you are.” Sirius smirked, walking towards the work desk that did not hold the cauldron. He would never forgive himself for knocking over the cauldron and ruining the potion Adelaide worked so hard on brewing correctly just because he was in the heat of the moment.Propping Adelaide on the edge of the desk, Sirius moved his hands to either side of her on the old wood. Stepping closer between her legs, his lips soon found hers and they were locked in a passionate embrace. Hands caressing whatever slither of skin they could get, both Adelaide and Sirius groaned into the kiss as the crackling of magic started rising from deep within.A sudden knocking at the door broke them apart, barely, and Adelaide tried her best to catch her breath. Keeping her legs locked tight around Sirius’ waist, her hips still tilted up into his, her head turned to the side and her eyes widened at Charlie standing there. The second eldest Weasley’s eyes were wide and slightly glazed over at the scene before him.Clearing his throat quickly, Charlie rubbed the back of his neck. “Sorry for the intrusion.”Sirius growled slightly, his hands pressing into the desk as he kept his head leaning into Adelaide’s shoulder, refusing to look up at the man who broke off their heated encounter. He knew if he looked up, he would most likely say something he would later regret – maybe. Sirius did not really regret much, but when it came to Adelaide, he did not want to upset her or cause her any harm, whether it be emotional or physical.“It’s alright.” Adelaide whispered out, clearing her own throat as she shifted a bit to sit up straight, her hands resting on Sirius’ shoulders. “What is it?”“Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley are on their way with Harry.”Sirius perked up instantly at the sound of his godson’s name.“Everyone is already downstairs. Dinner is ready, too.” Charlie nodded, turning on his heel quickly and rushed back down through the hallway to get to the staircase. He was muttering under his breath about having the decency to not participate in indecent behavior out in the open where anyone could witness, with a full house no less.“What’s got your knickers in a twist, dear brother?” Fred and George both met Charlie by the staircase, getting ready to apparate downstairs to bug their mother with their ability to now do so freely.“Nothing. Mind your bloody own business, you two.” Charlie groaned, pointing at his younger brothers with a glare before he headed downstairs, ignoring the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.Charlie knew that he had no right to feel this way. Adelaide was not his – she never was.She belonged to somebody else. 

Dinner, as always, was lovely. Adelaide found herself helping Molly with the tail end of the clean up before grabbing a drink and joining Sirius at the table.She handed him a glass of his own, pressing her lips against his right temple before resting a hand on his shoulder.“He’ll be here soon.” She whispered down to him, a knowing smile appearing on her lips.She knew he was anxious about seeing Harry again. He was also anxious about spending time with the boy. He looked so much like his father, James, and Sirius was worried that he would not be able to differentiate the two.Sirius smiled, reaching back and up to his shoulder so he could clasp his hand around Adelaide’s. He leaned back in the chair and took in a deep breath.“What if he doesn’t like being here?” Sirius closed his eyes for a moment as he began to let the negative thoughts take over.“Stop. That’s bloody ridiculous.” Adelaide shifted to sit on the arm of the chair, wrapping her arm around Sirius’ shoulders before pressing her lips against the top of his head. “He’s your godson. He is going to love being here with you. With all of us, I’m sure.”“I want to figure out how to get him for go-“ Sirius stopped midsentence, hearing the loud, obnoxious footsteps of Nymphadora Tonks. He shifted up in his chair, looking up as he heard Remus and Arthur start to discuss a few things about the order. Molly shuffled over to close the door but not until Sirius could make eye contact with his godson, Harry Potter.Adelaide looked up at the same time, a smile appearing on her lips at the sight of Harry before Molly had closed the door.She got up from the chair, pressing another gentle kiss to Sirius’ temple before greeting her best friend with a tight hug.“I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages, Tonks.” The blonde sighed, holding onto her friend before they both mutually split from the hug.“Wotcher Addy!” Tonks beamed, her eyes moving to focus on Remus as he stood by Sirius at the table now.“Right to business, then?” Tonks spoke up, looking over at Moody and Kingsley before she sat down besides Adelaide on the loveseat by the opposite wall. Adelaide assumed she chose that spot so she could get a good look at Remus the entire time. The metamorphaghus was anything but subtle.“We need to keep the kids out of it as much as possible.” Charlie spoke up, crossing one leg over the other pressing his ankle into his knee as he leaned forward on the same leg he had lifted. His foot was shaking a bit, purely out of nerves. Sure – working with dragons was extremely dangerous…but thinking about working against the Dark Lord, and the dark magic he and his followers possessed was even more dangerous.“I disagree.” Sirius shot back, shaking his head. The older man refused to even look at Charlie as he spoke. Charlie, luckily, did not think much of it but Adelaide knew it was because she had been honest with him and told him that Charlie had awkwardly kissed her during their Hogsmeade outing.“Yes, well,” Severus Snape, who was hovering in the corner of the room, snickered a bit. “You truly do not have much of a say, Black. Being a fugitive and all…”Adelaide could sense that Severus was getting joy from belittling Sirius and his status as he was technically still a fugitive from the Ministry.“I have to agree with Charlie.” Molly spoke up, trying to diffuse the tension between the two former foes (Or current, Adelaide was not sure where Severus really stood).Remus took in a deep breath. He wasn’t sure how much bickering between Sirius and Severus he could take. Sober, atleast.“Merlin, you can cut the tension in this room with my left big toenail.” Tonks muttered over to Adelaide, nudging her friend as she gestured to Charlie, Sirius, and Severus.“Tonks!” Adelaide hissed, trying to control her laughter as she covered her face with both hands.“Something funny over here?” Charlie grinned, leaning over in his chair as he looked over to his friends.“No. Nothing.” Adelaide cleared her throat, shaking her head.“That’s not true, Addy!” Tonks grinned mischievously, “I told her that I could cut the tension between all you egocentric men with my left big toenail.” This time she spoke louder.Remus choked on his tea, setting the cup down and covering his mouth for a moment as he finished coughing. “I’m sorry, what?”Tonks’ cheeks turned red. “Nothing.”“Oh…now it’s nothing?” Adelaide hissed, pinching Tonks’ arm before she grinned up at Remus.Severus had rolled his eyes, talking something over with Kingsley. Adelaide was still trying to figure him out. She had a feeling it would take a bit of time for his true intentions to come to light. Something about him still made her uneasy. She didn’t trust him.Sirius felt the same, which she knew. It was quite possible that his feelings had some influence over Adelaide.“Enough business talk.” Sirius cleared his throat and sat up, “I’d like to propose an idea. Something to help us relax just a bit before the school year begins. A party!” He took a sip of his brandy, shooting a wink over to Adelaide as he did so.“A party.” Charlie scoffed, rolling his eyes. “I mean, I don’t think it’s necessary. Especially with everything going on right now.”Molly sighed, watching her son glare at Sirius before looking over at Adelaide. The Weasley matriarch could not bear to lose another son right now – seeing as Percy and Arthur had a big blow out. Percy cared more for his job than his family and while that destroyed Molly, she still loved him more than life itself.Sirius looked to Charlie. “Well, seeing as this is my home and not yours, I don’t think your opinion really matters.” He stated flatly.“I think it sounds lovely, Sirius.” Tonks spoke up, sensing the discomfort coming from Adelaide as she sat back and watched Sirius and Charlie.“Nothing too fancy. But I’d like for the kids to have some fun before heading back to Hogwarts. They deserve some normalcy.”Adelaide smiled weakly, watching Sirius for a moment before she let her eyes travel over to Charlie, who seemed totally put out by the discussion. ◄◄◄◄◄⸙►►►►► The next day Adelaide found herself packing up the wolfsbane potion into separate vials for Remus. Her wand tucked safely in the messy bun at the crown of her head.“Addy?” Charlie leaned against the doorframe of her lab, his knuckles rapping gently against the open door.“Hm?” She didn’t bother looking up, ensuring that she was safely distributing the potion. Her nose crinkled as she began thinking of how horrible this must taste for Remus. Even though the potion was completely worth the horrible taste, Adelaide could not help but feel bad that Remus had to endure this painful transformation since the young age of five.“We need to talk.” Charlie sighed, walking forward as he leaned against the counter beside her now. “Do you have a minute?”“Sure.” She told him with a nod. She collected the vials and set them aside before taking out her wand to do a quick once over of the cauldron to clean it now that it was empty.“I need to apologize to you.” He admitted, chewing on his bottom lip for a moment before he stood up and looked down at her. “I’ve been a right prick lately. And I’m sorry.”“It’s not me you need to apologize to, Charlie.” Adelaide raised a brow, looking up to him. “It’s Sirius who deserves your apology. He’s allowing you to stay here, in his home, and you have not been treating him well. It’s not fair.”Charlie sighed. “I know. Don’t you think I know that?” He muttered as his arms crossed tight over his chest. “I just… I miss you.” He confessed, “And I miss Tonks. I miss our friendship.”“A lot has changed in the past four years. I’m not saying that we can’t still be friends, but you need to apologize to Sirius first. I want you to –““Well, hold on there.” Charlie cut her off, “You know he’s not been treating me nicely, either, right? I mean, this should go both ways. Don’t you think?”Adelaide sighed. She hated to admit it, but he was right. “Well, he’s only acting this way because of the way you’ve treated me.”“The way I’ve treated you?” He cried out, completely confused at the accusations Adelaide was making now. “What the bloody hell are you on about?”“See, I knew you’d act like this. You never take responsibility for your actions. That needs to change, Charlie. A war is coming. We all need to work together or else we could lose it all.”Adelaide tried to keep a straight face. Inside – she was screaming and crying to get out. The more they discussed plans for The Order, the more she started to panic. She had begun picking her nails, ripping the delicate skin from around the nailbed until she bled. Luckily for magic, she was able to heal herself and cast some glamours over the self-inflicted injuries.“It’s like talking to a fucking brick wall with you. Self-righteous. That’s what you are, Adelaide.” Charlie snapped, pointing his finger at her, basically standing as close as possible without the tip of his finger poking her eye out.“This conversation is done. It’s over. I think you should get out of the house tonight. I don’t want to see your face.” Adelaide was getting riled up, her hands shaking slightly as she tightened them into fists. “You know what?” She laughed angrily, “Better yet, go back to Romania. Go home.”With that, she stomped away from him, slightly nudging him with her shoulder as she did so. She stormed out of the lab and down the hallway towards Sirius’ and Harry’s voices. She needed to calm down and if she had to look at Charlie’s face any longer, she would have exploded.She ignored the stomping of Charlie’s feet as he, too, left the lab and stormed down the staircase. She ignored the stares of the twins from their room as they were most certainly eavesdropping in on their conversation.“Everything alright, love?” Sirius took in Adelaide’s appearance, noticing that she was flustered.“Yes, everything is just fine.” She cleared her throat and brushed a rogue strand of hair out of her eyes before smiling over to Harry.“Sirius giving you the grand tour?”“Yes, honestly the rooms seem to be never ending in this place.” Harry admitted sheepishly. A laugh escaped his lips as he looked over to his Godfather with a hint of admiration.“I was just going to show Harry the family tree.” Sirius cleared his throat, nodding over to the room behind them. This was a room that he had not gotten the strength to enter in a while – Adelaide had never even seen it herself.“May I join you?” She questioned, chewing back on her bottom lip as she tried to block out the loud voices coming from the floor below them – Molly, Arthur and Charlie.“Of course, darling.” Sirius watched Harry walk in first, his hand grasping Adelaide’s tightly before he gave her a quick kiss.Adelaide had walked in after Sirius, though decided to give Sirius and Harry their space as they discussed the noble and most ancient House of Black. She slowly made her way around the room, taking in the flayed wallpaper, letting her fingertips brush against the wall as she walked around.“Regulus Black?”“My younger brother.” Sirius responded to Harry’s inquiry sadly. “There’s something that you should know about the Black family, Harry.” He sighed before going on, “Most were supporters of the Dark Lord. They believed in the purification of the wizarding race.”“Purification of the wizarding race?” Harry repeated, tilting his head to the side as he posed the question.“Yes. Getting rid of muggle-borns and having pure-bloods in charge.” Sirius responded flatly. “These are beliefs and values that I did not hold and still do not hold, to this day. I was an outcast, the bastard son who was sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin like everyone else in the Black family. I was a disgrace, an embarrassment…”Adelaide tried to ignore the lurching in her stomach as she listened to Sirius. Her heart was breaking, piece by piece, as he explained how hard his childhood had been growing up in this house.“Reg was killed,” Sirius glanced over at Adelaide, a sad smile forming on his lips. This was information he had never even discussed with her yet. “We presume it was because of attempting to leave that life behind but… that is something that I may never really know or understand.” He shrugged, his hands finding their way into his pockets as Adelaide made her way over and wrapped her arm around his, leaning into his side.Adelaide could tell that Harry was uncomfortable with the ideals of the Dark Lord and his followers.“This place may seem drab, Harry,” Adelaide began with a soft laugh, “But Sirius’ father put a lot of protective enchantments up. Dumbledore added some of his own, too. We are safe here. You have nothing to worry about.”Harry smiled, giving Adelaide a nod of thanks before he turned to the door as he heard Molly call up that lunch was ready.“Go on down. We’ll meet you there in a little bit.” Sirius smiled, watching Harry walk off and heading down the staircase.“You’ve never told me any of that before, Sirius.” Adelaide whispered, her head moving to rest against his shoulder as one hand reached down to slip into his pockets, grabbing hold of his own hand in the process. “Are you doing ok?”Sirius smiled weakly, his fingers lacing with hers though remaining in the front pocket of his trousers. “I’ll be just fine. Especially with you right here with me.” He told her, turning to look down at her, his lips pressing against her forehead.“I’m always going to be here. Right here. With you.” She shifted to now wrap her other arm around him, snuggling herself into his chest. Godric, he smelled amazing.“I want you to get dressed up tonight.” Sirius told her, letting go of her hand so he could wrap his arms around her waist, walking backwards and taking her with him as he exited the room. He did not want to stay in there for much longer. Although he hated his family – apart from for Andromeda and Regulus – he hated seeing his name burned from the tree.“Dressed up?” Adelaide giggled, letting Sirius walk her out of the room while their arms were still tangled around one another. “Why? Do you not like me in ratty blue jeans, darling?” She teased him.“Hm, well. If we’re being honest,” Sirius shifted them around, backing Adelaide up against the wall with a smirk now appearing on his lips.“I prefer you naked.” 

Adelaide had to beat Sirius off her with an imaginary bat to get away and prepare herself for the night. She decided to skip lunch, she really was not terribly hungry anyway.It most certainly was not because she was unsure if Charlie was still around or not.As Sirius walked off, joining the rest of the house downstairs for lunch, Adelaide walked into her lab to pick up the vials of wolfsbane. She dropped them off to Remus in his room before heading back to the room she shared with Sirius to start preparing.She did not have many options but decided to get a bath and relax before having to worry about that nonsense.Slipping into the bubble bath she had drawn for herself, Adelaide let out a deep sigh as the hot water started working against her muscles. She knew she couldn’t enjoy herself too much tonight. Work had been extremely taxing lately and she knew that she would not want to be exhausted for her shift tomorrow.She had to remind Sirius that Harry and Arthur had an early day, as well – tomorrow marking the start of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry. But she did agree with him. They all needed a night to relax. To forget about what was most likely to come in the weeks, months, and years to follow.War. Loss. Death.Adelaide shook her head, trying to rid her mind of the dark images it concocted at the thought of what the future might hold. She had been so busy worrying about everything that she lost track of time and realized that by the time she snapped out of it, her skin was pruned and the water cold and was slowly draining through the stopper lodged at the bottom of the porcelain tub.Washing herself quickly, choosing to forgo cleaning her hair (after all, she could use simple magic to fix that) she stood from the tub and cast a quick drying charm before wrapping herself in a warm towel. Softly making her way to the bedroom, Adelaide let the towel drop before she slipped on a clean set of undergarments and a white, silk robe that Sirius had gifted to her.She certainly was not used to being showered in gifts the way Sirius liked to do. Sometimes she thought he was trying to spoil her simply because he had twelve years of his life taken away from him. He had the ability to be in a normal relationship taken away. Adelaide knew it may have been a bit selfish, but she was almost glad that things happened the way that they did.If Sirius had never been imprisoned, if he never had escaped, she probably would have never met him. Atleast not the way that they had met. Sometimes it was hard for her to believe that things happen for a reason.She always enjoyed doing her makeup the muggle way. Andromeda had taught her how to do so at a young age. The woman was happy to pass along the skills she had learned from spending time with the muggle-born family of her husband, Ted. After all, Tonks was not really interested in make up so she couldn’t do it with her.She couldn’t be bothered with her hair, so she used her wand and began casting a few quick beauty charms. Adelaide smiled in the mirror as she watched the tresses of light blonde curl and hang down her back. Leaning forward, she looked over the make up that she had sitting out on the vanity.After a little bit of deliberation, she decided on not going too crazy and started applying a soft black eyeliner along her eyelid. She was still not the best at it, so after a few cleaning spells – it was just easier that way – she had finally finished her look and sat back in the chair to glance over herself in the mirror.“Well, that’s as good as it’s going to get.” She muttered to herself, shaking out the curls a bit before she heard a knock at the door.“Sirius, you don’t have to knock. It’s your own room. I promise I’m decent, unless you don’t want me to be!” She called with a giggle, turning in the chair to face the door.Only, it wasn’t Sirius in the doorway once the door was pushed open. It was Charlie.“Oh.” She cleared her throat, the smile slowly falling from her lips. She was still pretty upset with him after their fight and had decided that she did not want to be bothered. “I thought you would be long gone by now.” She admitted, turning back to the mirror, and looking at him that way.Charlie stepped in slowly, closing the door behind himself for some privacy.“I left for a little bit.” The redhead admitted, rubbing at the back of his neck before he continued walking through the room. He did what he could to ignore the unsettled feeling bubbling up in his stomach at the images of what Sirius and Adelaide did in the bed as he sat down on the edge of the mattress.“But you came back?” Adelaide continued watching him through the mirror. She chewed on her bottom lip, pulling at the bottom of her robe to close it up over her bare thighs. She felt a bit too underdressed to be sitting in front of Charlie dressed this way.“Yes.” Charlie forced a smile, his hands nervously rubbing together before he leaned forward with his elbows pressing into his thighs. “I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier.”“For what? For you basically calling me a bloody self-righteous bitch?” Adelaide spun around now, bracing herself on the seat as she glared over at him. “Because that hurt. And a forced apology is not going to make me forgive you. Not that easy, Charlie.”“It’s not forced. Mum may have talked my ear off about treating you better since you’re an adult and you can make your own decisions…but it’s not forced. I promise you.”“Molly did always love me more than you.” Adelaide laughed softly, thinking about how Molly must have taken her side in their argument. It was slightly surprising, as Adelaide got the idea that Molly was not the biggest fan of Sirius, either – they had a lot of disagreements.Charlie laughed. “Yeah, well, that has definitely not changed.” He told her, shaking his head at the memories of his Mum always taking Adelaide’s side during their summer fights at The Burrow.“But, truly,” Charlie shifted to kneel before Adelaide now. One hand grabbed the chair beside her leg while the other cupped the side of her face. “I love you, Addy. You are my best friend, and you always will be. I am so sorry for how I’ve been acting since I’ve gotten back.”Adelaide froze at the sudden closeness between herself and Charlie. She blinked and tried to look away but something within her made her feel compelled to look back at him, maintaining the intimate eye contact.“It’s my own fault, really.” Charlie continued, “I’m the one who left. I would have been here with you, changing with you… I just worry for you, and I just want you to understand it’s because I care about you. In no way am I trying to ruin your relationship, or, or…anything like that.” Charlie let his hand drop, brushing against Adelaide’s thigh before he pushed himself back up to sit on the edge of the bed behind her.Adelaide had been holding her breath, her eyes darting around watching his every move. The way his eyes bore into hers sent butterflies fluttering incessantly around her stomach. Only once Charlie sat back down and removed himself from right up against her did she let go of that breath. She didn’t even realize she had been holding it in and quickly looked away out of embarrassment at the thought of Charlie knowing that he affected her in such a way.“I wasn’t thinking that Charlie. Don’t worry.” Adelaide shook her head with a sad smile. “But…” She sighed, “I would like for you and Sirius to try and be friends. Even if it is completely fake and only for my benefit. Can you do that for me?”Charlie nodded, glancing down for a moment before looking back up and making eye contact with her. “For you?” He smiled. “I’d do just about anything.”Adelaide stood up and as Charlie did the same, she threw her arms around his neck. Pulling him down into her, she hugged him tight. “I told myself I would stop being so emotional and I don’t want to ruin my makeup, but I can’t help it.” She laughed, shaking her head for a moment before dabbing beneath her eyes with the pad of her thumb as she looked up at him.“I’m just happy to have my best friend back.” She told him, planting a soft kiss on his cheek before pulling away to walk over to the closet. “Although I really do wish it was under better circumstances.”Charlie slipped his hands into his pockets, shifting his weight around as he looked after her. Relishing in the memory of her lips against his cheek, Charlie let out a soft sigh. “Yeah, I do wish it was under different circumstances. But let’s not talk about the Dark Lord, or the war in general. Not tonight.”He continued watching her, smiling softly to himself as she disappeared into the closet. He tried to occupy his mind with happy thoughts – ones that did not revolve around Adelaide, of course. He cleared his throat, glancing down to his feet as he watched the robe she had been wearing go flying through the air, landing on the floor just outside of the closet doorway.“You’re right.” Adelaide called, tugging on a pale blue dress that hugged her curves just right. She walked back out, a smile forming on her lips as she looked up at him.“Do you want to take bets on how long it takes Tonks to make a real move on Remus tonight?” Charlie smirked, walking to the bedroom door with Adelaide as she slipped her feet into white ballet flats.Giggling softly as they entered the hallway, Adelaide glanced up at Charlie with a grin. “I say three hours and five drinks.”“Very specific.” Charlie laughed. This felt nice. And as normal as it could be.“Do you know Tonks?” Adelaide joked, shaking her head. “She barely listens to a word Moody says because she’s always too busy making eyes at Remus.”Charlie rolled his eyes playfully, “If only I knew my best friends were into older men…” He joked, elbowing Adelaide with a smirk plastered across his lips.“Oh, sod off you wanker.” She cried with a laugh, shoving Charlie as they finally stepped off the staircase and into the room Sirius had set up with drinks and some music.Fred, George, and Ginny were fooling around with a few of the joke supplies that the twins had been creating over the last few months.Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting with Sirius and Remus and Adelaide could hear the discussion of the Marauders’ time in Hogwarts.Before she could speak, Tonks swept herself between the two, linking her arms with both Charlie and Adelaide.“Are my eyes deceiving me? Did my two best friends kiss and make up?”“Tonks!” Adelaide hissed, her eyes widening at the expression her friend had used.Charlie coughed, pulling his arm from Tonks. “Yeah, we made up. Best friends for life, remember?” He joked, trying to diffuse the awkward air that was now surrounding them. He could feel Sirius watching and decided to walk over to his parents to grab a drink.He noticed Bill walking through the doorway, a smaller woman by his side looking out of place. “Is that Fleur? She looks familiar.” He glanced to his father for a response.Arthur nodded, “She was Beauxbatons champion in the Triwizard Tournament. You must have seen here when you were there.” He told Charlie, sipping his drink slowly as he watched his wife walk over to their eldest and Fleur. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► “You owe me. I’ve won the bet.” Adelaide nudged Charlie, taking a sip of her glass of firewhiskey, crinkling her nose at the burning sensation. It never got better for her, which was why she typically stayed away from the liquor.Charlie looked down at Adelaide with a smirk, his eyes following her gaze as he watched Tonks slip her hands along Remus’ arm, pressing herself into his side. She had a serious look on her face, like she was talking Remus into something. The man did not seem uncomfortable, just a bit embarrassed since he had noticed the watching eyes of those around them.“It’s only been two hours.” Charlie said, nudging Adelaide back. “You were very specific with your bet. Therefore, you do not win! We can say it’s a tie.” He teased, looking back down to her after he tore his gaze from Tonks and Remus.“Fine.” Adelaide pouted playfully, looking up at Charlie as she finished her drink. “I should have bet that they would have danced.” She groaned, turning to watch Sirius walk over to the record player and start to play something slow.“Tonks has two left feet. Poor Lupin.” Charlie laughed softly, shaking his head as he watched Tonks pull Remus towards the opening of the room, assuming she was creating it to be a makeshift dance floor.“They’re perfect for one another.” Adelaide sighed, chewing on her bottom lip before she looked over at Charlie. “Shush and be happy for her.”“Sorry, don’t want to intrude,” Sirius cleared his throat, his hand extending towards Adelaide with a smile forming on his lips. “May I have this dance?”Adelaide could not help but blush as she handed her drink to Charlie. She slipped her hand into Sirius’ and gave him a nod. “Of course.”Charlie took the glass and watched them walk off, wrapping their arms around one another as they swayed to the music. He could not help but feel jealousy course through his veins. It was a ridiculous notion, really. Why on earth was he jealous?“This is a beautiful song.” Adelaide whispered, her hands locking tight behind Sirius’ neck as she kept herself close to him, making sure she didn’t start stepping on his toes. She was also known to have two left feet – just like Tonks. She just hid it a bit better than her.“Chicago.” Sirius grinned, “A great band from when I was growing up. Remus is the one who showed them to us while we were hanging out at James’ house one summer.” The older man let his hands roam down her sides, giving her hips a gentle squeeze.“Come hold me close, never release me”“This is nice.” She whispered, resting her head against his chest. “The kids look like they’re enjoying themselves. They need a sense of normalcy.”Adelaide let her eyes fall shut as she swayed with Sirius to the music.“Oh, baby don’t release me. Open your arms, let my love in”Charlie couldn’t help but watch Sirius hold Adelaide close to him, his hand tightening around the glass for a moment before he finished off the drink and set the empty goblet down on the table.“Love me tonight, love me forever and ever”“Are you feeling ok over here, brother?” Fred and George appeared behind Charlie, looking over at each other, then to Charlie before following his gaze to Adelaide and Sirius.“I’m fine, you two. Really, I am.” He cleared his throat and looked at them with a roll of his eyes. “I know you two have been eavesdropping but I don’t have any juicy gossip for you tonight.”Fred sighed first, then George followed. They wandered off, most likely to play around with some of their joke products in one of the unoccupied rooms.”You know I can’t forget you”Charlie watched them go before turning back to the rest of the room. Sirius and Adelaide had stopped swaying but remained wrapped around each other.“I should get to bed.” Adelaide whispered, a soft sigh escaping her lips as she slipped her arms from around his neck, pulling back a bit to look up at him. “I’ve got work in the morning and it has truly been a bloody nightmare lately.”Sirius nodded solemnly. He wanted to spend the night wrapped up in her arms but knew that she needed to get her rest. “I love you.” He told her, his hands moving to cup her face now. He stared down at her, nuzzled his nose against hers before pressing his lips against hers in a soft, yet still passionate kiss.“I love you, too.” She whispered against his lips. A small smile appearing on her lips, breaking the kiss as she did so.“Addy sure has grown up.” Bill stood beside his brother, a small smirk forming on his lips as he peered over at the young girl wrapped in the arms of her lover.“Your point?” Charlie sighed, looking up at his older brother.“Just wondering how that was going for you.” He teased, patting his brother’s shoulder before he turned to Fleur, taking her hand and offering to dance with her.Charlie sucked in a deep breath, held it, then blew it out as he watched Adelaide start to walk away from Sirius.“Don’t wake me up when you come to bed, either.” Adelaide was teasing Sirius, her hands slipping down his arms, holding his hands for a moment before she let them drop. “I mean it.”Sirius grinned, “Are you sure, love?”“Yes, I’m bloody sure! I need my beauty rest.”Sirius smiled, watching the healer turn on her heel and start to head towards the door.“Goodnight everyone!” She called, waving her hand as she exited.She knew she needed to get out of these uncomfortable shoes, in one of Sirius’ old shirts, and into bed as soon as possible. Glancing at the clock she noted that if she went to bed now, she would get roughly around six hours of sleep. That was not enough sleep for her, especially before a long shift at the hospital, but she would have to make do.She started up the stairs, already tugging her hair up into a messy bun at the top of her head.“Addy.” Charlie had waited a few moments before following her. He was rushing up the stairs to catch up to her, hoping his shoes didn’t make too much noise on the old steps.Turning at the sound of Charlie’s voice, Adelaide smiled softly. “Come to pay up for losing the bet?”Charlie rolled his eyes playfully. He truly did miss this back-and-forth banter between them. “And I already told you,” He stopped outside of her bedroom, leaning against the wall. “You were too specific with your bet. You lost! If anything, I win by default.”Adelaide shoved him with a laugh, “Whatever you say. What do you want for your prize?” She asked him, pushing open the door and stepping inside. She thought nothing of it as she kicked the shoes off, walking back to the bathroom and keeping the door open as she started to undress, finding the shirt she had worn to bed the previous night. Tugging it over her head, Adelaide walked back out and collapsed onto the bed, covering herself with the sheets as she looked up to Charlie who was lingering in the doorway.If he wanted to be friends, that was fine. Adelaide could be friends with Charlie. She could forget about bearing her soul to him, kissing him, telling him that she loved him – though she now knew she had never quite made the distinct comment about being in love with him, just that she loved him – only to have him leave her asleep in his bed and head off for an adventure in Romania.She had kept his letter. It was crumbled, and the parchment was splotched with the tears that had since dried up. She kept it safely tucked in her vanity at her parents’ house – feeling weird keeping it around Sirius for reasons still unknown.“Well?” She spoke up, leaning on her side, propping her head on her hand as she watched him. The redhead stayed still, almost like he was frozen in time. It had taken him a few more moments before he walked forward, sitting beside her on the bed. He did his best to forget that this was the bed she shared with another man.“Come with me to Romania.”“What?” Adelaide shot up quickly, tugging the blankets to ensure that her legs were completely covered. It really did not matter though. Charlie had already reached over and grabbed her knee. His touch was intimate and hot, warmer than she remembered anyway. And this was all over the blanket. She could only imagine how his rough hands felt on her bare skin.No, stop thinking about that. Sirius. Think of Sirius.“You heard me.” Charlie squeezed her knee, leaning forward a bit as he watched her. A smile formed on his lips, as he sat there, watching her – he could see the gears turning in her head. As much as he was enjoying teasing her, he knew he had to let go.Removing his hand, Charlie moved to stand up now. Adelaide ignored the cold that was now spreading throughout her body.“After we drop the kids off at the Hogwarts Express in a few weeks…” Charlie cleared his throat. He wasn’t sure why he was nervous. “Dumbledore asked me to head back to Romania. He set up a few meetings with a few wizards that he knows. He wants me to recruit them for The Order. And I want you to come with me. I want you to travel, get out and see something other than these four walls.”Charlie didn’t mean for it to come out like that, of course. It had sounded much more harsh than he intended. “I want you to meet my friends. And the dragons.” He was all but begging now.Adelaide chewed her bottom lip back into her mouth, her legs bending as she wrapped her arms around her knees, holding them to her chest. She was not sure what she should say. A part of her was afraid – afraid of being alone with him, afraid of coming face to face with the dragons. She was afraid to see that side of her best friend – the side of his she didn’t know, the one she was not familiar with.Another part of her was afraid of how Sirius would react. She could see that he was becoming a bit possessive of her, which was something she didn’t particularly like, but she still understood his reasoning.“Let me think about it.” She finally looked up to Charlie, forcing a smile onto her lips as she did so. “Ok? Just… a few days. Let me think about it.”Charlie nodded. “A few days.”He turned to head back to the door, stopping as his hand grabbed the knob. He turned, glancing back over his shoulder with a smile.“Goodnight Adelaide.”

“Amelia Bones?”“Yes, that’s who oversees it all. Right, Mr. Weasley?”Harry turned to look at Arthur who had stuffed a piece of buttered toast into his mouth with a silent nod.“Wotcher Harry!” Tonks grinned, patting the boys back a bit too rough, causing him to lurch forward with a grimace. “I can assure you that she is fair. I don’t think you have anything to worry about.” Tonks reassured Harry, a smile still on her lips as she slowly made her way over to Remus who was seated on the other side of the table.Sirius, who had never even gone to bed from the night before, still dressed in his clothes from the party last night, plopped down in a chair beside Harry.“The Ministry is no joke, Harry. Promise me that you won’t lose your temper.”Harry shook his head. He knew he couldn’t truly promise such a thing – he had been extremely unpredictable lately, especially after everything that happened in the graveyard with Cedric and Voldemort.“Alright, we should get going. Don’t want to be late.” Arthur licked his lips to remove any of the remaining crumbs from his toast before he grabbed his briefcase and jacket, gesturing for Harry to follow along.Once they were gone, Remus spoke up. “Sirius, you look like hell. You should probably get some rest.”“You’re probably right about that.” Sirius sighed, rubbing at his face. He had not been sleeping well lately but had been trying to keep that a secret. It was easy with Adelaide; she was quite the heavy sleeper.“Everything ok, mate?” Remus piped up again, folding the pages of the Daily Prophet over so he could get a better look at his friend.“Just have a lot on my mind, Moony. I’ll be fine.” Sirius shrugged it off and once he started moving towards the staircase, he tried to ignore the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach that soon enough, everything would be different. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► S E P T E M B E R 1995 Adelaide had made the decision to hold off on telling Sirius that she was going to Romania with Charlie for one full week. She knew she had to tell him, of course, after all… they were leaving tomorrow.“I already told you that I think it’s a bad idea for you to travel with us to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, Black.” Moody grumbled, crossing his thick arms over his chest as he stared over at the man.“That’s nonsense! They won’t know it’s me! I’ll be going as Padfoot!” Sirius cried angrily, throwing his arms up in the air.“I still vote no.” Moody spat back, shaking his head.Adelaide was sitting in the loveseat by the doorway, her feet curled up beneath her as she peered up from the book with a small smile. She focused on Remus, who was standing beside Sirius, hands deeply stuffed in the front pockets of his trousers. They had both known that Sirius would not take no for an answer and had come up with a joke to play on him.Remus bet Adelaide ten sickles that Sirius would not agree to it, and Adelaide agreed. Of course, she knew that she may win and would not take Remus’ money from him.“I think Adelaide has an idea that may work.” Remus cleared his throat as he spoke up, a grin appearing on his lips now.Giggling beneath her breath, Adelaide reached over to pick up her wand and whispered unintelligible so nobody would hear what she was summoning from her room.“What is it, love?” Sirius grinned, turning to face Adelaide. As the item flew and landed in her hands, Adelaide turned and shook it in the air. In her hand was a black, leather dog collar, the leash was upstairs.“Bloody hell, you are mad woman!” Sirius croaked, pointing his finger at the collar, and shaking his head. “You in on this, too, Moony?” He slapped at his friend’s arm beside him, standing up and moving over to Adelaide to snatch the collar from her hand.The healer snatched it close to her chest, giggles escaping her lips as she tried her best to keep the collar from Sirius.“I’m not mad! I’m quite serious!” She exclaimed, still giggling away. The laughter was even harder now as Sirius stepped closer and she could see the laughter starting to bubble up in his own chest.“You’re bloody mad. The two of you!” Sirius collapsed beside Adelaide, glancing over at her as his lips twisted up in a smirk.“Maybe just a little bit.” Remus called from the opposite side of the room. His lips turned up in a smile.Adelaide shook the collar again, the bell that was hooked to the front of it rung out lowly. “Can you blame us? I mean, you cannot just run around like the rabid dog that you are.” She teased him, nudging his side with her elbow.“I’ll wear this for you. And you, alone.” He whispered teasingly, his hand reaching out to run along her thigh, squeezing roughly as he went.Blushing wildly under Sirius’ comment, Adelaide cleared her throat and looked around the room. “Stop that.” She laughed softly, handing him the collar now.“I don’t know. Maybe.”Molly walked in, raising a brow at the sight before her. “What’s this?”Adelaide’s joyful appearance faltering slightly as she watched Charlie walk into the room behind Molly.“Addy thought it would be funny for me to wear this when we drop the kids off at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters tomorrow.” Sirius held the dog collar up with a laugh.Molly’s cheeks turned red, “Godric, that’s a bit much, don’t you think?”“Thank you, Molly! That’s what I said.” Sirius’ voice boomed throughout the room, his hands thrown back up in the air as he glanced over at Adelaide, noticing the change in her face.“Are you alright, love?” He whispered down to her, leaning over so that nobody else could hear.“I’m alright. Just…” She was trying to find the right words. “I’m nervous for tomorrow, that’s all.” She whispered back, resting a hand on his cheek as she leaned forward and pressed her lips against his gently. “I just worry a lot about you, Sirius.”Sirius sighed, kissing her lips back before he pulled back to look down at her. “I’m alright, darling. You don’t have to worry about me. I promise you.”Sirius reached over and slipped his hand into hers, lacing their fingers together before he leaned back in the seat to get comfortable.This whole time, Charlie stood by the doorway watching the pair. He could tell by the way Adelaide was acting that she had not told Sirius about going away for a week. With him, no less. He knew she’d be upset at him for what he was about to do next – but it had to be done.“Your bags all packed, Addy?”Turning quickly, Adelaide stared up at Charlie with wide eyes. Her hand froze in Sirius’, and she could feel him squeeze her before pulling back.“Bags packed?” He repeated, looking up at Charlie and then back down to Adelaide. “What’s he on about, Adelaide?”Adelaide sighed softly. “I was going to tell you, I swear it.” She whispered, not wanting their personal business to be broadcasted in front of everyone. Although she knew Molly had a specialty in gossip – everyone would know by the end of the night regardless.“Tell me what?” Sirius repeated himself. The anger was now evident in his voice.Adelaide stole a quick glance to Charlie before turning completely to face Sirius.“Charlie asked me to come with him to Romania. Dumbledore has set up a few meetings for Charlie and…and I think it would be good to get out of the house. For me.” She was beginning to stumble over her words. She was nervous. Worried that Sirius would flip out about her keeping this a secret from him.“It’s only for a week. Seven days. That’s it.” She whispered, reaching over to grab his hand tightly.Sirius nodded. He let Adelaide hold his hand but only for a moment longer. He pulled himself from her grasp. Standing quickly, he tossed the dog collar onto the table before him before walking out of the room. He made sure to make eye contact with Charlie, anger still written across his face as he found his way up the stairs and away from everyone.“I’m sorry, Addy, I-uh, I figured you told him already.”“You’re a terrible liar, Charles Weasley.” The blonde muttered, shaking her head as she reached forward, grabbed the collar, and stood up so she could follow Sirius. He certainly was not being quiet; his thundering loud footsteps were echoing off the walls as he stomped through the hallway above them.“I’m going to go after him. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.” She spoke again, keeping her voice low as she passed by Charlie.Everyone stayed silent, though kept their eyes on Adelaide and Charlie. Molly couldn’t help but let out a huff.Charlie sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck. He knew it was wrong, but it couldn’t help but try and hide the smirk forming on his lips. He was happy that his efforts to get Adelaide out of the house and away from Sirius were starting to work.He didn’t hate him, though. But there was a part of him that did not think he was the right person for his best friend. Honestly, he was feeling the same way about Tonks and Remus. Could it be the age difference? Charlie wasn’t sure – but now that he was back in the picture, he didn’t want to have to be the one to pick up the pieces when his best friends got their hearts broken by the older men. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► “Why didn’t you tell me?”Adelaide chewed on her bottom lip as she looked over at the piano where Sirius was seated. His back was still turned to her, and it became apparent quickly that he was refusing to turn and make eye contact with her.She understood that she hurt him. In all honesty, she was not sure she could even provide him with an answer to his question. Why didn’t she tell him? The excuses running through her mind were just that. Excuses.She was an adult now, no longer a child who had to be afraid of getting reprimanded, grounded by her parents, or a detention in school.“I’m sorry, Sirius. Truly, I am.” She kept her voice low, knowing that they had listening ears all around them.She moved forward a few more steps, teeth chewing away on the inside of her cheek. She did not want to leave on a bad note. She did not want him resenting her for keeping something from him.“Everyone always leaves.” Sirius muttered, slamming down on the piano keys. The sudden rush of the loud noise made Adelaide cringe and pull back from reaching out to him.“What do you mean by that?” Adelaide questioned.“I don’t know how to say it any clearer than I just did.” Sirius spat. Adelaide could see he was trying to reel in his anger, but he was just having a hard time doing so.“Sirius.” Adelaide sighed out, finally gathering the courage to reach forward and rest both hands on his shoulders from behind. “I’m not leaving you. I’m not leaving The Order.” She told him, shaking her head. Her fingertips pressed into the front of his shoulders before she found herself slipping her arms around him completely, pulling him back into her chest. Her chin leaned against the top of his head, and she closed her eyes, relishing in the feeling of having him so close to her without pulling away.“I’m going to help Charlie for The Order. I’m only going for one week.” She leaned her head around so she could glance at the side of his face. His eyes were shut, and his hands had left the keys to grab her forearms, holding her in place. She let her lips brush against the side of his face as she continued, “That’s only seven days. I’ll owl you every day. I promise.”“I’m sorry, Adelaide.” Sirius whispered. She could sense the grief behind his words. He knew he had acted out, a bit dramatic, but she could also see where he was coming from. He truly had lost everything he knew and loved in the last war. Adelaide assumed he needed her around him all the time as proof that he was no longer alone.Proof that he could protect her. He felt guilt that he couldn’t protect Marlene, James, Lily…even Peter he felt guilty about.“It’s ok, Sirius.” She whispered down to him, shifting back a bit as he moved around on the seat, trying to remain wrapped up in her arms as he did so.He reached over, grabbing his wand, and whipping it up from the seat to point to the door. He whispered beneath his breath, shutting the door, and locking it.Adelaide felt her cheeks warm at the implication she knew Sirius was putting out there.A part of her wanted to tell him that she didn’t need to show him, physically, that she was his – but she knew he needed this connection. The way that their bodies molded into one another when they were making love – he needed to be close to her.“I love you.” Sirius told her, his hands moving to grab onto her hips as he stood from the bench.“I know.” She whispered back, her hands grabbing onto the collar of his shirt before she started unbuttoning it and pushing it from his shoulders.Her fingers danced against his skin, taking in the soft, yet still slightly weathered texture on his arms. Since the incident at the shrieking shack, being rescued by Hermione and Harry with Buckbeak, Sirius certainly had filled out. When they first met, he was nothing but skin and bones. Even then, she knew there was something special about him. She couldn’t explain it, though.They had all the time in the world (well, more like for the next twenty-four hours really) but they were rushing through foreplay. Usually Sirius enjoyed going slow, undressing his lover to relish in the feeling of her body beneath, or above, him. The way her skin, skin that was so pure, skin that housed her bones that had not seen a day of war like his bones had.In the process of undressing, Sirius had almost ripped her shirt, apologizing against her skin as his lips ravished any slice of smooth heaven he could reach.“Godric, Sirius, slow down.” She giggled, wrapping her arms tight around his shoulders to keep him in place. She looked down at him, now standing before him completely bare. It had taken her a few times of being with him to not be embarrassed, but right now she couldn’t help but feel the blush rising in her cheeks as she stared into his eyes.“I’m going as slow as I can, darling. I want you so bad.” He groaned playfully.Before long, they were both completely nude, and their lips found one another in a passionate embrace. It did not take long for them to connect their bodies after Sirius had grabbed his wand and all but shout out the contraceptive charm. Sirius had spun Adelaide around, pressing her down onto the top of the piano before entering her swiftly again, a low groan escaping his lips as he felt her body embrace him, clenching down around him, inviting him in deeper and deeper.Adelaide knew this was not the most romantic way of being together and was a bit perturbed when Sirius had spun her around. He had never been this rough with her, but if she was going to be honest, she liked it.It was frantic, the way his hips pounded into her from behind. It was almost as if he was treating this like the last time that he would be able to have her. He was usually attentive to her needs in bed, but this time was different. He was being selfish, and Adelaide was ok with that for right now.“Sirius…” Adelaide moaned his name lowly, her head leaning forward before she lifted it to turn and look over her shoulder at him. His fingernails were making half-moon indents into her flesh, and she ignored the feeling of her hip bones slamming into the side of the piano. She knew that would leave a bruise, but it would be hidden beneath her clothes, so she had no worries.“I’m going to come, love.” Sirius whispered hoarsely into her shoulder, his teeth nipping gently against her skin.Adelaide closed her eyes and let out another moan, relishing in the slap of his hips against her. It was not even a minute more before she felt Sirius let out a low, deep growl. His hips stuttered against hers, reaching his climax, and releasing himself deep within her walls.They stayed connected for a moment before Sirius pulled out of her, his hands staying on her hips before running up her back. He kissed her spine softly, breathing in her scent before he grabbed his wand to cast a quick cleansing charm over himself before casting one over Adelaide, as well.They got changed in silence. Adelaide chewed on her lower lip for a moment or two before she looked over at Sirius. She couldn’t read what he was thinking, and usually he wore his emotions right on his face and was unable to hide them from her.“Is everything ok between us?” She asked him, her voice barely a whisper. She tucked hair behind her ears as she started to feel a bit uneasy.“Of course, it is.” Sirius responded, finishing up with buttoning his shirt before he walked over to her in a few big strides. His arms wrapped loosely around her waist before he pressed his lips against her forehead. “But I do have a question for you.”Adelaide pulled herself back a bit, looking up at Sirius with a small smile. Her hands cupped his face as her thumbs began stroking his cheek bones. “Anything, Sirius. You can ask me anything.”“Do I really have to wear that blasted dog collar tomorrow?”  

“I cannot believe you really think I’m going to wear this thing!” Sirius’ voice echoed loudly in the dimly lit hallway of number twelve Grimmauld Place. His hand was raised up in the air, spinning the leather dog collar around his finger.“Sirius, I mean it. We can’t have you getting caught.” Adelaide sighed, placing both hands on her hips as she watched him fool around with the collar.“She’s right, you know.” Remus walked out from his bedroom and closed the door, turning to face Sirius and Adelaide with a small, sad smile.“You know, Remus, just because you were always the voice of reason does not mean that I’m going to take your advice!”Adelaide rolled her eyes, reaching forward now and plucking the collar from Sirius’ grasp and turning, quickly walking down the staircase.Her bags were packed, and Charlie had already traveled to Romania and back again to drop off their things. He returned to take Remus’ place in the guarded escort of Harry and the rest of the kids to the Hogwarts Express.The full moon was only a few days away, and although Remus tried to put on a smile and hold a cheerful disposition – he was struggling. His bones ached a bit more than usual and even though he had Adelaide to thank for his supply of Wolfsbane, the pain never completely vanished.“Whatever you try to do or say,” Remus spoke up, gently resting a hand on Sirius’ arm. “She will always win. You know that don’t you?”Sirius sighed as though he was defeated. He did not mind letting Adelaide get her way, though. The way her eyes lit up when she was truly happy was probably the greatest sight he had ever laid his eyes on.Before he met everyone downstairs, Sirius grabbed a robe from the bedroom and handed it over to Adelaide so he could wrap himself around it before he transformed to speak to Harry before sending him on his way to Hogwarts.Adelaide tucked the robe in her bag, still utilizing the invisible extension charm – it really did become quite practical.The group had made it to King’s Crossing, and Sirius quickly transformed into Padfoot. Adelaide, with a smug grin upon her lips, bent down and clipped the collar around his neck.“Now, be a good boy and behave Padfoot.” She whispered, rubbing her boyfriend who was now in the form of a shaggy, black dog, behind his ears.The dog let out a low growl, though a soft whine followed soon after.Adelaide clipped the hook of the leash into the metal clasp of the collar before standing up and following the rest of the group.Moody was grinning like a mad man – Adelaide found herself giggling and thinking to herself that the moniker ‘Mad-Eye’ was extremely fitting for the man.“Godric! Slow down!” Adelaide squealed, her feet moving as fast as they could now, weaving through the crowds as Padfoot dragged her along.They soon found a room, luckily empty, that Padfoot could transform back into Sirius so he could have a final farewell with Harry before the boy boarded the Hogwarts Express.Harry entered at the exact moment Adelaide was wrapping the robe around Sirius’ bare shoulders.“Ah, Harry, my boy.” Sirius was beaming proudly. He had been vocal about wanting Harry to come and live with him and had been hoping that it would be able to finally happen at the end of this upcoming school year.Adelaide stood off to the side, not wanting to interrupt the moment between the two.“You know where to find us…where to reach us… If you ever need to.” Sirius reminded Harry, wrapping his arms around his godson, the two embracing tightly before letting go.Harry gave Adelaide a hug goodbye as well, before he exited the room and headed off with his friends.“You worry for him.”Adelaide stood beside Sirius, wrapping her arms around his waist as she kissed his cheek. It was hard to not worry about Harry. Hard not to worry about the rest of the students in Hogwarts… The Dark Lord… What the future would bring.Would there even be a future?Adelaide found herself shaking her head, trying to rid herself of the vile thought of losing everything.“They’re too young to go through a war.” Sirius muttered, his body turning to the side as he wrapped his arms around her shoulders. He leaned down to press his lips against her forehead. “For us… well, not you, but we were older the last time the Dark Lord started the war. I know he’s strong, and tough… just like his parents, but I still worry.”Adelaide smiled sadly. “It’s normal to feel that way. He has all of us in his corner. He’s not fighting this alone. We will make sure of it.” She promised him, slipping her hands onto either side of his face as she pulled him down so she could press her lips against his roughly.This was going to be their last kiss for a week. Adelaide wanted to make it worth it.“I’m going to miss you, Addy.” Sirius whispered against her lips. There were only a few minutes left of their time together until she returned home to him. He could sense the other man lingering behind the closed door waiting to whisk her away.“I’m going to miss you too. I’ll only be gone for a week. I’ll be home before you even realize I’m gone.” She teased, trying to diffuse his nerves.“Addy?”It had seemed Charlie finally worked up the courage to open the door and enter the room, looking over at the couple as he did so.“We need to get going.” He added, his hands fumbling with the port key they were going to use to head to Romania.Adelaide looked up at Sirius, pleading silently with just her eyes for him to behave.Stepping back from her, Sirius turned to look over at Charlie. “Let’s get one thing straight.” Sirius couldn’t help but smirk – just a little one. “I don’t like you.”Adelaide stood in silence, watching the two interact with wide eyes. She could sense the uneasiness of Charlie, a gulp becoming visible as his adams apple bobbed up and down in his throat.“Although I don’t know why she does… Adelaide likes you. So, I’m going to ask you to take care of her. Make sure nothing bloody happens to her. Not so much as a broken nail. Do you understand me?”“Yes.” Charlie replied.He felt slightly offended that Sirius would even have to remind him to take care of Adelaide. After all, he had known her longer. They were best friends for a long time, and he would always protect her. At all costs.Sirius then turned back to Adelaide, a smirk forming on his lips. “Do you have everything you need? You didn’t forget anything, did you?”Shaking her head, Adelaide leaned forward and kissed Sirius gently. “I’ve got everything, don’t worry about me.” She told him. “Do me a favor, though. Make sure Remus takes his potion every day this week.”Sirius smiled, cupping her cheeks as he looked down at her. She was so selfless. Always thinking of others, never thinking of herself. She was far too good for him, for Charlie, for the world.“I will, love, I promise. Don’t worry about old Moony, he’ll be alright.”Adelaide smiled and gave him one final kiss before he transformed back into Padfoot. She knelt before him and hooked him back up to the collar. “I know you hated this. I swear I’ll do what I can to make sure you don’t have to go through this again.” She promised the dog, a sad smile on her lips as she pet him again, giggling as he lapped at her face with his wet tongue.Charlie felt like he was intruding on an intimate moment…even if Sirius was now in the form of a dog. He turned around to face the door just in time for Tonks to stroll in with a wide grin.“Oh, I’m going to love this!” She exclaimed, clapping her hands together loudly.Padfoot turned and let out a whine. Adelaide laughed again, the scene before her becoming quite comical. “Oh hush.” She said down to him, reaching over and handing the leash to Tonks.“See you in a week.” Adelaide told her friend, giving her a hug before looking over at Charlie with a sigh. “Ready to go?”Charlie reached into his pocket and pulled out a silver spoon. Adelaide assumed this was their portkey. She has certainly traveled under stranger circumstances and remembered that portkeys were typically random objects, such as a spoon, so they wouldn’t pull in any unwanted attention – especially from muggles.“Ready when you are.”Adelaide glanced once more to Sirius and Tonks as they exited the room and left her and Charlie to themselves.Putting aside the war looming on the horizon, Adelaide found herself a bit excited to travel somewhere new. She knew she was able to play her role as healer for The Order well, but now she was being sent with Charlie to recruit foreign wizards and witches. The thought excited her. The thought that they could very well win this – hoping to minimize casualties and make sure the outcome of the first wizarding war did not repeat itself.Charlie extended his hand towards Adelaide, gesturing for her to hold onto the other end of the spoon. When she did so, he spoke loudly, “Portus!”Once the spoon became bewitched, the sensation took hold of both Charlie and Adelaide. The dirty room at King’s Crossing began to spin out of control, sweeping the two around. Adelaide hated this method of transportation. She hated flying, too, and would much rather be forced to fly through the clouds in the sky than use a portkey.The magic pushed and pulled Charlie and Adelaide through space and time, the tugging sensation deep behind both of their navels until they landed roughly in an extremely unkempt grassy knoll.Once Adelaide got her wits about her, she brushed off at her clothes and spun around in a full circle to take in her surroundings. She was about to open her mouth to ask Charlie where they had landed because to her, it didn’t look like what she thought a dragon sanctuary was supposed to look like. She was cut off by a loud, blood-curdling screech and a sudden rush of heat over her whole body. She let out a yelp, her eyes squeezing shut as her body lurched forward, almost tumbling to the ground before Charlie was able to grab her by her upper arms and hold her up.The screeching continued and Adelaide felt her blood run cold, the hairs on the back of her neck stood up as she felt the heat continue sweeping over them.“Charlie?” She hissed, trying not to show the fear she was feeling on the inside.“Just breathe, Addy. Open your eyes. Look over there.”Adelaide shook her head, “No. I can’t.”“Yes, you can. Look!” Charlie was beaming, almost with pride and joy.It took another loud screech for Adelaide to press her face into Charlie’s chest, her hands whipping up to cover her ears. She shook her head, refusing to open her eyes.“Adelaide. Please. I promise you. It’s ok. It’s safe.” Charlie held her tight to his chest, hoping that she would decide to open her eyes and look. The sight before them was truly magnificent.“On the count of three I want you to open your eyes. Ok?” Charlie continued, pulling back so he could look down at the blonde witch in his arms.“Ok.” She whispered out, still trying to control her breathing and ignore the pounding headache she was already experiencing from the closeness of the screeching noise.“One.”Adelaide began chewing on her bottom lip. She let Charlie pull back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were still shut, and her hands were still covering her ears.“Two.”Charlie wrapped his hands around hers, prying them from her ears in a gentle manner. Adelaide let him, not putting up a fight. Her eyes remained closed.“Three.”At the sound of the number three leaving Charlie’s lips, Adelaide took in a deep breath and let her eyes flutter open. Charlie wrapped his arm around her shoulder, holding her up against his side as he gestured to the space below them. His lips turned up in a wide grin.Charlie was not lying. The view truly was magnificent. Adelaide let her eyes adjust, almost not believing what she was seeing. A real-life dragon was much different than a boggart dragon. There was not much else around them, so Adelaide assumed that they must have landed at one of the far ends of the sanctuary and would have to walk back to the cabins.Before them was a Common Welsh Green dragon. Adelaide remembered every breed there was – all thanks to Charlie, of course. The dragon was green in color – hence the name of breed. Adelaide let the deep breath, the one she almost forgot she was holding, go and let her eyes travel along the large body of the beast below them. The two spiked horns on top of his head were intimidating and made Adelaide stand just a bit closer to Charlie.Charlie cleared his throat, glancing away from the dragon to look down at Adelaide with a smile.“Welcome to Romania, Addy.”    

It had been three days since Adelaide and Charlie made it to the Romanian Dragon sanctuary. Just as promised, she had written Sirius a letter each day so far. Other than working towards getting over her new fear of dragons, Adelaide was enjoying herself.Charlie’s friends at the sanctuary were nice and friendly enough that Adelaide felt comfortable. It was already four in the afternoon, and both Charlie and Adelaide had already met with two foreign wizards in the morning.The first one, Jian, came from China. He was an older gentleman, and his beard was as white and long, if not more so, than Dumbledore’s. Charlie bet Adelaide five sickles that he was younger than their old headmaster, but Adelaide quickly brushed his teasing off to the side. She did not want Jian hearing and letting Charlie’s childish antics affect his sway towards joining The Order.They discussed the efforts they would want to begin taking against the Dark Lord over tea, and Adelaide -surprisingly so- did most of the talking. She knew she would have to discuss with Dumbledore having a larger role in the Order. She was skilled at many different things – and if Dumbledore truly wanted assistance all over the world, including America, she would want to be a part of it.The second person was a witch by the name Marla. She was a Romanian native and had ties to a powerful family – the van Huttons’. Charlie had heard of them, but Adelaide was in the dark about the power Marla’s family held. Marla took much more convincing than Jian and by the time she left Charlie’s cabin, Adelaide was reaching into the back of his icebox and plucking out the bottle of firewhiskey.“This early, Ads?” Charlie chuckled from his spot on the couch, glancing over his shoulder as he watched the small blonde grab two tumblers and pad her way back to the couch.“She was a handful. And quite intimidating.” Adelaide admitted sheepishly, chewing on the inside of her cheek for a moment as though she was lost in thought. She held the glasses and bottle in her lap for a moment before she seemed to snap out of the spell, setting the glasses down and pouring them bot hefty amounts of the amber liquor before knocking it back before Charlie even took his glass from her grasp.“Godric, Adelaide, slow down.” Charlie guffawed with wide eyes as he watched the healer lean back with her own eyes falling shut.“What if we lose?”Charlie raised a brow. “What?”“You heard me.” Adelaide kept her eyes shut for another moment before turning her head to look at the redhead sitting beside her.“What if we lose? What if I die? What if h-he who shall not be named is the one to kill me? Or you? Or-or Sirius…my parents...”Charlie set the full glass of liquor down and reached over to grab Adelaide’s hand. He squeezed her hand tightly and shook his head. “You cannot think like that. It’s only going to weigh you down. At first it will just be mentally taxing. But soon… it will start to affect you physically.”Adelaide let out a heavy sigh. She knew Charlie was right, but she always hated admitting that. This instance was no different.She went to speak but was cut off by Charlie’s front door bursting open, slamming into the wall as a very out of breath Hugo stood, hunched over.“Hugo?” Charlie jumped up, rushing over to the man.“Wild Jack is freaking out. Bloody beast clipped Harley’s leg when he was going to feed them.” Hugo wheezed out, leaning forward with both hands on his knees as he began to try and regulate his breathing.From her frozen stance beside the couch, Adelaide could see the sweat dripping down Hugo’s face, trickling off the tip of his nose as he was bent over.“I can help.” She reached down, grabbed her wand and sticking it through her hair that was tied back in a low bun.“Absolutely not!” Charlie barked back at her, his hand moving to grab her shoulder, holding her in place. “You could get hurt. I can’t let you go out there. I’ll bring Harley to you.”Adelaide narrowed her eyes at Charlie as he barked the order at her to stay put. She thought he knew her better than that. She hated being told what to do.“Fine.” Adelaide muttered, crossing her arms over her chest.If this was not a serious situation, Hugo probably would have cracked a joke. A small smirk was slowly weaving its way onto his lips before he stood up straighter, now towering over Adelaide, and even Charlie.“Let’s go, Weasley.” Hugo grabbed Charlie’s arm and dragged him through the doorway.Charlie glanced back at Adelaide for one more fleeting moment before rushing out through the door with Hugo on his heels.“Bloody bastard.” Adelaide muttered, groaning a bit as she stared pacing the spot in front of the door. Ten minutes had already passed by before Harley hobbled in through the door with a grimace.“Adelaide.” Harley bowed, forcing a smile on his lips.Harley was shorter than Charlie, though still much larger than Adelaide. She stared up at the brunette, shaking her head for a moment as she took in his appearance.“You look like you were attacked by a dragon, Harley.”“You don’t say!”Harley let out a laugh and took Adelaide’s hand as she led him over to the couch.Although she was thin, she had a decent amount of strength. Tearing at his trousers to get a better look at the deep gash in his calf muscle, Adelaide gestured to the untouched glass of firewhiskey.“Hugo interrupted before Charlie could take a sip. Take it. You’ll probably need it.” The healer spoke with a smirk upon her lips. She watched as Harley reached over and plucked the glass up before downing the amber liquor quickly.“Don’t have to tell me twice!” Harley beamed.Adelaide took her wand from its place, nestled in her hair at the nape of her neck, before assessing the wound a bit more thoroughly. She did what she could to clean it, getting rid of any possible infection, before closing the wound up.It had taken her a few tries – the gash was a bit deeper than she had anticipated. The skin, just as soon as it knit back together, reopened, and blood began to seep out, trickling down his leg. Once it closed for good, Adelaide pat Harley’s knee with a smile.“Good as new.” she told the man with a nod. She pushed herself up and tucked the wand back into her hair. Right now, it was the easiest place for her to keep it. Romania was a bit hotter than she had imagined and found herself wearing jean shorts with no access to pockets.Harley flexed his leg, lifting it up while he remained lounging on the couch.“Bloody hell, you are truly a miracle worker, Adelaide. We should keep you.” The brunette teased, sitting up now and rubbing at his leg where the small red scar was. “Charlie would probably love having you around.”Blushing at Harley’s insinuation, Adelaide glanced over to him and rolled her eyes. “Well, unfortunately for you, I’ve got a good paying job back in London.” She laughed, “And I don’t think Hugo could beat, or even match, my current salary.” She teased back.The front door came crashing open again. Adelaide had come to the conclusion that none of these men know how to open a door properly.“Bloody hell, Charlie won’t have a front door soon if you all keep acting like barbarians!” Adelaide laughed, turning to look at the door when all she heard in response was grunting and groaning.Hugo and another dragonologist, Aoife, were dragging Charlie and holding him up by his arms.“Charlie got himself caught up in some of the crossfire, Adelaide.” Aoife, the only other woman on the sanctuary for the time being, spoke up first. Unlike Hugo, who had worry written all over his features, Aoife looked pissed.“I told him not to jump in when he did. But does he listen? No!” Aoife continued grumbling, shifting Charlie’s weight on her shoulder as she looked over at Adelaide.Charlie groaned as the two continued dragging him through the doorway of his home. His face was contorted in immense pain. The blisters were starting to bubble. The skin rising up on his back from the flames of a dragon.“Godric!” Adelaide cried, rushing over to the kitchen table. She abruptly knocked everything off from the top to make run for Charlie. Luckily there were only a few things that could be replaced easily, a glass or two and perhaps even a plate, so she thought little of them as Hugo laid Charlie down onto his stomach.Adelaide blanched at the sight before her. Charlie’s shirt was torn in half down the center of his back, most likely Hugo’s doing. Adelaide shoved Hugo out of the way, instantly rushing to Charlie’s side and brushing some hair out of his face.“Hey, Charlie,” She whispered, a weak smile on her lips. “I’m going to make you all better. I promise. Just try not to move around too much. Honestly, I might have to knock you out.” She admitted with a sigh. She ran her fingers through his hair again, brushing the strands from his sticky skin. She turned to look at Hugo, “Give him some firewhiskey. There’s a straw in the kitchen drawer. Beside the oven.”Adelaide looked over at Aoife with a worried look. “What exactly happened?” She needed to know everything about the dragon that did this. Was there anything that she needed to know that was specific to the properties of the flames that damaged the skin on Charlie’s back? She wanted to make sure she healed him appropriately.Aoife shook her head, tucking red strands of her hair behind her ears. The woman was just as tiny as Adelaide but certainly had muscles where Adelaide did not. Her skin was littered with tattoos, most of them mashing into the next and Adelaide could not tell where one ended and another began.“There’s nothing special. Just dragon flame. He didn’t blister up until we got here though, it looks like it’s getting worse.” Aoife explained, chewing on her bottom lip as she watched the healer wave her wand around, summoning supplies for Charlie.Adelaide called out with her wand pointing towards the staircase, summoning some salve she had only just made the day before to leave with Hugo incase there were any accidents. She did not expect to need the salve so soon. Especially not for Charlie.Catching the jars of salve that flew through the air, Adelaide opened them and set them down, silently praying that Charlie would stay still and not knock them over. She watched out of the corner of her eye as Hugo forced Charlie to take large sips of the firewhiskey through the straw. Once Adelaide noticed Charlie’s muscles no longer tense up and relax, she let out a heavy sigh.“He’s relaxing, but I’m going to use a sleeping charm.” The healer announced to the room as she slowly leaned down close to Charlie. “When you wake up, you’ll be good as new. Promise.” She whispered to him. Her lips pressed down against his temple, ignoring the sweat residue that rubbed off on her lips as she pulled back. Charlie had opened and shut his mouth a few times to try and say something, but no words had ever left his lips. Adelaide could see the pain across his face, his eyebrows furrowed, and nose crinkled up.Whispering the sleeping charm, gently tapping the temple she had just kissed with the tip of her wand, Adelaide stood beside him for a moment to make sure it worked and there were no issues.Once she noticed he was in a safe slumber, she got to work on his back. Hugo, Aoife, and Harley stood back and watched her, keeping silent as they let her do her job. Adelaide was a kind soul, but in the three days that they had know her, they know she took her career very seriously. And she was damn good at it, too.By the time she had been able to clean up his back from the blood, torn flesh, and blisters, Adelaide set her wand down. The magic was holding up and now the salve could do its job. She slipped her fingers into the thick ointment and began spreading it over Charlie’s back, ignoring the pang of anxiety rising from within her at the feeling of his injured skin.The salve began working quickly. As Adelaide finished up applying the ointment, she had already noticed the skin smoothing out and regrowing over the burns and blisters. She utilized her wand to wrap him in gauze to keep the ointment from rubbing off incase he ended up rolling over during sleep.“You’re one of the best healers I’ve seen, Addy.” Hugo rested his large hand on Adelaide’s shoulder, beaming down to her with admiration shining bright in his eyes.“You’re just saying that.” Adelaide laughed softly, cleaning off his hand from the leftover ointment residue before she used her wand again to levitate Charlie from the kitchen table. “But thank you. I’m glad I agreed to come after all. Who bloody hell knows what would have happened to you two if I weren’t here.” She grinned over to Harley, who playfully bowed towards her.“I’m going to bring him upstairs so he can wake up in his own bed instead of his on top of his kitchen table.” Adelaide told the trio, starting towards the stairs with Charlie’s asleep body levitating in tow.“I’ll check back in tomorrow morning. Holler if you need anything. Anything at all.” Hugo told her, ushering Aoife and Harley out of the cabin, closing the door behind him as they went.Adelaide was able to bring Charlie upstairs, gently easing his body down onto his mattress before she tossed her wand over to his nightstand. She knew it wouldn’t be right to leave him alone, so she decided to stay in the same room until he woke up. She walked into her room to change into comfortable clothing, a thin pair of joggers and a tank top before she washed herself up to prepare for bed.She had not put him under that strong of a sleeping charm, so the length of his rest was unknown. After she washed up, she plaited her hair back behind her face and slipped herself beneath the blankets.Charlie was laying on his stomach, his face smushed against the pillow, sound asleep. Smiling weakly, Adelaide reached out to gently pull the blanket up over his legs and waist before she rolled onto her side. She tucked one hand beneath the pillow and took in a deep breath.She knew she handled this situation with poise. Although it was not extremely serious, she still felt frightened that Charlie had gotten himself hurt. Burns were always the worst ailment to treat – atleast for Adelaide.A sick, heavy feeling deep in her stomach felt as though it was weighing her down. Drowning her in the unknown. What kind of injuries would The Order – her friends and family – obtain during this war? What would she do if there was something she could not heal?There was only one thing that came to her mind that she knew she was unable to treat.Death.

Charlie had been knocked out from Adelaide’s sleeping charm for well over six hours. When he woke, it was still early in the morning hours. His eyes fluttered open, shut again, then remained closed as he got his bearings. His back felt tight, but the pain he was used to from the burns he had received previously was not present.He felt something wrapped around his torso, not too tight and not too loose. Rolling over to his side, Charlie reached up and ran his fingers along the gauze with a groan. He was a bit sore – but that was to be expected.Blinking a few more times, Charlie rolled all the way over to his other side so he could face the windows to try and gauge what time it was. Most likely just before sunrise, judging by the colors in the sky.He found himself watching the sky through the windowpane and wondering what the future was going to bring. How many more sunrises would he be able to witness and experience? He was beginning to sound like Adelaide…Speaking of…“You’re up.” Adelaide softly padded back into the bedroom, two mugs of tea in her hands as she walked over to Charlie’s side of the bed.“Uh, yeah.” Charlie shifted to sit up, groaning a bit at the tightness in his back as he stretched and moved the muscles that had been magically put to sleep for the last few hours.“Thank you.”“Just doing my job, Charlie.” Adelaide whispered, sitting on the edge of the mattress besides his as she handed him one of the mugs. “But you’re welcome.” she added, a small smile appearing on her lips as she watched him take a sip.Charlie was surprised she had remembered just how he liked his tea. Just a splash of milk and three dollops of honey.Adelaide glanced away, watching the sun begin to rise in the sky. The hues of orange and pinks were spreading further and further apart across the horizon. The sight was truly remarkable.“The sun never rises like this in London.” Adelaide muttered with a small laugh. “I guess I can see why you love it here so much.”Charlie sat the mug down, freeing his hands up now as he started to unravel the gauze from his torso. “So, the gruesome dragon injuries don’t cancel out the beautiful sunrises?” he teased, smirking up at her as he got all of the gauze removed from his body.“Don’t remind me.” she sighed, shaking her head. “That was terrifying, Charlie.”“Hurt like a bitch, too.” Charlie tried to joke about his accident.“Very funny.” Adelaide sighed, rolling her eyes before she started scooting back further on the bed. “Turn around, I’m going to check your back to make sure it healed properly.”Adelaide found herself on her knees, kneeling behind Charlie as the mattress dipped beneath her weight. Her fingertips gently pealed the rest of the gauze off as she leaned closer to get a better look at his back. Charlie had been lucky. The burns and blisters healed perfectly. The only imperfections left on his skin were from previous injuries. And to be honest, Adelaide would not define them as imperfections. His scars are what made Charlie…Charlie.“Everything looks good.” she told him, moving back and further away from him now.“Thank you, Healer Corden.” Charlie teased, turning to glance over his shoulder at her now. He smiled and got up from the bed to get a new shirt.Adelaide nodded. “You’re welcome, Mr. Weasley.” she teased back, a soft laugh escaping her lips as he spun around with a look of bewilderment.“Mr. Weasley?” He cried, shaking his head. “You make me sound older than I am!”Adelaide continued to laugh. “Well, you are getting old!” she told him. Her lips turned up into a smirk as she watched him check himself out in the mirror at his dresser.“Check my head yourself. Not a single gray or white hair. I’m the best looking Weasley there is!” Charlie exclaimed. His fingers raked through his hair slowly, holding up the strands in between his fingers as he was checking for any gray or white hairs.“I don’t know about that. Bill has blossomed into quite a good-looking young man.”Charlie whipped around in shock. “You’re lying!” he cried with a laugh, shaking his head furiously at his best friend.“Maybe I am… maybe not. You’ll never know.” Adelaide teased, turning to walk out of the room after scooping up her mug of tea that was now too cold for her to finish drinking.Maybe they could be friends again.Maybe.◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► “I’m itching to get back home.” Adelaide muttered, double checking her bags over what seemed like the tenth time.Charlie rolled his eyes. “You’ll stay for the bonfire, won’t you?”It seemed as though Hugo and Harley wanted to throw a celebration for the pairs last night at the sanctuary. For Adelaide, she had a feeling it may be the last time she stepped foot on the sanctuary grounds. Charlie, though… he had been very outspoken about his plans. Once his obligation to The Order was fulfilled, he would move back to the sanctuary to continue working.That did not surprise Adelaide, of course – although she had secretly been hoping that he would not go back to Romania for good. He had always been a wild spirit. Even more so than Tonks and that was a surprise to all that knew both.“Yes, just for a bit.” she told him with a nod. She grabbed the last remaining personal item that needed to be packed, stuffing it into her bag before closing it and looking back at Charlie. Adelaide was beginning to feel a bit defeated that they could not get Marla to join their cause. Atleast not yet. Charlie had some ideas on getting her involved and though he would not explicitly share with Adelaide, she had an idea of what he would try next.“Very well. Party pooper.” Charlie grabbed her bags and started for the door. “I’ll see you there. I’m going to send our bags back now.”Adelaide chewed on her bottom lip. She tried to tamper down the need to say she’d take the bags back, knowing she would not return once she stepped foot back inside number twelve Grimmauld Place. Maybe it was unhealthy for her to miss Sirius as much as she did. She was not even sure it was humanly possible to feel the way she did.Watching as Charlie left with their belongings, Adelaide walked to the window to take in one last Romanian sunset. Far off in the distance, but still too close for comfort, the roaring of a dragon could be heard. Shivering slightly at the thought, Adelaide chose to ignore the sudden sense of dread at the beasts’ cries.“I can see that’s something you certainly won’t miss.”Turning at the intrusion, Adelaide smiled back at Aoife.“You’re not wrong. That noise is something I don’t think I could ever get used to. You’re terribly brave to get up close and personal with them.”Aoife shrugged her shoulders, collapsing on the bed with her arms tucked beneath her head.Adelaide ignored the gut feeling that Aoife was comfortable and familiar with Charlie’s room. More importantly, his bed.“They really aren’t that bad. Once you get to know them, that is.” Aoife smiled over at Adelaide, gesturing for her to join her on the bed.Hesitating for a split second, Adelaide turned back to the window. One last glance as the sun dipped below the mountains behind the sanctuary grounds was what she needed. Charlie wanted tonight to be about forgetting the war. Forgetting the pain that was bound to lie ahead in their lives’. Adelaide, being slightly more pessimistic than her friends and family, was having a hard time with that concept.How can one just forget that the Dark Lord is back? Forget that there was a war on the horizon. A war that was going to drag them through the trenches of pain, loss, and inevitably death.“What’s on your mind?”Adelaide turned again with a sigh. She joined Aoife on the bed and laid back against the headboard, stretching her legs out.“Charlie wants me to try and enjoy myself. Forget about the war… To be quite honest, I’m having a hard time doing so.” Adelaide sighed softly. Her eyes fluttered shut and she tried to push the worries from her mind.“What about a certain wizard? Charlie said you have a special someone back home.” Aoife pried, a small smirk appearing on her lips.Laughing softly, Adelaide opened her eyes and peered down at the dragonolist sprawled out beside her. “Well, yes, ok. That little fact might play a bigger role than everything else.” she sighed and began chewing on the inside of her cheek. “It’s crazy. I never thought I’d be the person who was so dependent on someone else. He’s older than me, and I think I like that he already knows what he wants. He’s not childish…well, when he wants to be he is but that is besides the point.”Aoife laughed. “I think all bloody men are like that.”“Yeah, I think you’re right about that one.” Adelaide agreed.A comfortable silence passed by the two women. Glancing back to the window as the sky was slowly becoming a darker hue of blue, spreading out as far as she could see. The sun was almost completely set now.“So,” Adelaide cleared her throat and glanced back to the girl beside her. “You and Charlie?”Aoife blushed, sucking her bottom lip into her mouth. “Yeah, a little. I guess. Just friends. Who have fun here and there.” she shrugged her shoulders and moved to sit up so she could push herself into a standing position beside the bed.“Enough about stupid men.” She held her hand out to Adelaide. “Let’s go have some drinks by the fire.”Adelaide grinned. “Alright.” she agreed, reaching over to take Aoife’s hand and pull herself up so she was standing beside her now. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►►  A few hours later, Adelaide found herself sitting on a log with an empty cup of alcohol in her hands. Her eyes had not strayed from watching the flames dance before her from the fire pit Hugo had created.Charlie was standing a few feet away with Aoife and they seemed extremely…comfortable with one another. Adelaide did not want to break that up. She did not want to bug Charlie about leaving. After all, she could very well just leave without him and use the floo.She wasn’t intoxicated, having only sipped at two drinks over the course of the few hours that had passed since the beginning of the party.Tapping her fingernails against the cup for a moment, she quickly decided to do what Tonks liked to call an ‘Irish Goodbye’.  Tonks had been infamous for doing these back at Hogwarts. Any party that the trio had attended together, Tonks always left without a word. Adelaide would worry like the mother hen she was, and Charlie was usually too busy arguing about Quidditch with anyone who dared to join him to notice.Now, Charlie was too busy sweet-talking Aoife to notice Adelaide creeping through the dark back towards the main community building. She knew the fireplace inside was linked to the floo network and although it would take her a bit longer to get home than it would if she would have waited and used the portkey with Charlie, she was just fine with that.She wanted to get home as soon as possible. She had spent most of her time cooped up in Charlie’s cabin. She was too afraid to spend time near the dragons. She still had not told Charlie about her boggart turning into a dragon. A part of her thought that it would hurt his feelings somehow. After all, it truly seemed like Charlie loved the dragons more than his own family.Once inside, Adelaide let out a deep sigh. The bottoms of her shoes padded softly against the hardwood floors as she made her way down the corridor. The fireplace was in the back office, nestled behind Hugo’s desk.Adelaide couldn’t help but think it was funny that he had a desk. What kind of paperwork did a dragonologist need to do?Shaking her head with a soft laugh, Adelaide grabbed the knob once she got to the door and pushed it open. Heading right to the fireplace, she grabbed a handful of floo powder and without a second though, tossed it to the ground and stepped in.Once calling out her first destination, she felt the dragging sensation wash over her. Her first stop was a well-known wizard pub in Germany, Brutz and Brakel. After she got herself situated, cursing beneath her breath about taking this asinine way home. She really didn’t know why she was the way that she was… Stubborn.After seeing Charlie getting cozy with Aoife, a part of Adelaide couldn’t stomach it. She also missed Sirius and would much rather go home to snuggle with him while she told him about the trip.Grabbing more floo powder, she was throwing it down once again and stepping in. Calling out for her destination, Adelaide found her eyes falling shut as she was transported to the connected fireplace in Hog’s Head Inn.As she stepped out, she made the decision to use the facilities before traveling to her destination, Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. Raking her fingers through her hair after she removed it from the braid that was tied tight behind her head, Adelaide apprised herself in the dirty mirror with a soft sigh.After just seven days in Romania, with more sun than she had seen in a while, her skin had a very discreet, soft sun kissed glow to it. Not like she was complaining, though. She usually burned during the summers she spent chasing Charlie and his younger siblings around at The Burrow. And that was during a hazy, muggy summer day where the sun was often shrouded behind the clouds.The healer found herself understanding why Charlie loved it so much. Again…minus the dragons.For the final time of her long night, Adelaide grabbed a handful of floo powder once she walked back to the fireplace in the Hog’s Head. Throwing it down quickly, she hopped into the green flames and called out for Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► Remus had gone to bed hours ago, still recovering from the full moon that had only just occurred two days prior. Sirius, on the other hand, was wide awake. Jilted with nerves of finally getting to see Adelaide again, Sirius found himself pacing back and forth in their shared bedroom.Judging by her letters, she had enjoyed herself to some extent and Sirius truly wanted to hear all about her trip. More so than that, he wanted to hold her. He wanted to kiss her soft lips and run his fingers through her hair to hold her close.He never saw himself as being extremely needy. Clingy, which was the term Tonks had thrown out at him. Pfft.  He did not appreciate that.He wasn’t clingy, was he? No. Of course not. Just… in love.Sirius had retired his daily attire for a flannel pair of pajama bottoms and a genuine, homemade Weasley knit sweater. The summer season had slowly turned into fall, and the weather was getting cooler. Even in the house, Sirius wanted to stay bundled up. Warmth, no matter where it originated from, was soothing for him.He had spent so much of his childhood feeling nothing but coldness. Coldness directed to him by his wretch of a Mum and Dad – whole family, really, with the exception of Regulus. No, Regulus was just as misunderstood as he was. Unfortunately, he was not as strong and was unable to get away from the clutches of the Dark Lord and his psychotic family who were proud to follow such a vile creature.That’s what the Dark Lord was. He was no longer a man. Sirius believed he had not been a man for some time. He had believed this during the beginning of the first war. It felt as though they cut off one head, two grew back in its place. To Sirius, the Death Eaters were inconceivable. They were fanatical in their following of this being and his beliefs in purifying the wizarding world. Even now, as a grown man, Sirius could not wrap his head around it.He was so consumed with his thoughts that he did not hear the fireplace roar to life. Nor did he hear the quick pitter patter of footsteps as the individual rushed from the drawing room, up the stairs and down the hallway.The bedroom door opened, and Sirius turned around at the old wood creaking under the movement.“Hello love. Miss me?”

“Why the bloody hell did you leave without a word?”Charlie was fuming. He was pacing back and forth in the drawing room, eyes never leaving Adelaide as they narrowed in on her.She was standing in the doorway, arms crossed over her chest. It was the morning after her return from Romania and she had woken up early to make tea. Her hair was down in loose curls framing her face and she was wearing a pair of red and gold stripped pajama pants, which had belonged to Sirius as a boy. A thin cream, knit sweater hung snug around her torso. She had one more day off from work and was choosing to be lazy around the house. Her appearance made that statement perfectly clear.“You were busy with Aoife. Hugo was passed out and Harley was off doing Godric knows what! Why would I subject myself to sit there and wait for you to be ready?” Adelaide raised a brow, watching Charlie stop pacing for a moment as she spoke.“You sound jealous.” Charlie laughed.Rolling her eyes, Adelaide turned to walk out and head to the kitchen. Charlie followed, hot on her heels.“You’ve officially lost your mind, Weasley.” Adelaide muttered, already moving to make some tea for herself and Sirius. She had planned on grabbing some little treats for breakfast so that they could share everything and lay in bed for the day. She wanted one more normal day with him. She wasn’t sure when the next would be.“I missed Sirius. I just wanted to go home.” she told him flatly, narrowing her eyes at him before she flicked her wand. She could not help but giggle as he ducked out of the way of two freshly baked pastries (thanks to his Mum, no doubt) that flew from the table to the plate Adelaide was preparing on the counter.“Can’t we all just get along?” Adelaide spoke up again, his fingernails tapping relentlessly along the countertop as she stared down at the plate. She was trying to think of what else to say. She hated the tension. It was becoming quite childish and with war on the horizon, she did not have time for it.“I want nothing more than to have my best friend back. But you need to respect my relationship. Respect Sirius. He’s allowing you to live here, in his home, and you have been nothing but blatantly disrespectful to him.”Charlie stood frozen, his eyes wide as he watched Adelaide ramble off, spitting her words angrily at him without even bother to look at him. “You could atleast look at me when you speak to me.” he told her with a sigh.Looking up at him, Adelaide began chewing on her bottom lip. “I’m looking.” she stated sarcastically, leaning against the counter now as she watched him.“Alright. I’ll be civil. I’m sorry.” Charlie sighed, rubbing at his face with one hand while the other propped himself up against the counter beside her. “I love you, Addy. You’re my best friend. I don’t want to lose you again… I’ve been a git. I know that I have.”“You’ve been worse than a bloody git, Charlie.” Adelaide reached out to playfully slap at his chest, though a smirk soon took its place on her lips as she did so. “I just want you to try, that’s all. There’s a bloody, fucking war coming Charlie. We need to be united. Not just you and Sirius, this whole bloody Order. Don’t you understand that?”Charlie nodded, though he kept silent as he watched her. He knew she was extremely worried about fighting in the war, about losing her loved ones. He also knew that he still had a lot of growing up to do. And he had a feeling that being thrust headfirst into this war was just the thing he needed to finally grow up.“I understand, Addy, I do. And I’m sorry. Again, I’m sorry.” he told her with a sigh. “I’ll be better.” He reached out and brushed a strand of hair from her eyes. “I’ll do better.”Adelaide smiled softly. “I believe you.” she told him, reaching up to grab hold of his hand as it neared the side of her face. She let her hand, still holding his, drop to their sides. She laced her fingers with his and gave him a tight squeeze before letting go.“And thank you.” ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► N O V E M B E R 1995, G RI M M A U L D P L A C ETiptoeing through the corridor, Adelaide held the neatly wrapped gift close to her chest. It was the early morning of the third of November. Sirius Black was officially Thirty-Six years of age. Adelaide was doing what she could to make his birthday as special was possible.Things at Hogwarts were already heating up. Two words…well, a name in all actuality. Dolores Umbridge…quite the character, according to Harry. He had first encountered her at his hearing within the Ministry and now she was waltzing around Hogwarts as though she owned the place. And according to Harry, it very well may end up that way.Adelaide was glad she was no longer a student. Reading the things Harry sent to Sirius about the woman, well they were not flattering. Although during her stint at Hogwarts Adelaide always, always followed the rules. She knew that the character of this woman was more than enough to know that she would not have survived.Because during her teenage years, Adelaide Corden was quite the push over.“Addy, darling,” Sirius walked from the bedroom tightening the robe around his abdomen. It was still quite early, so he did not mind walking around (his own home, mind you) in nothing but a pair of briefs and his plush velvet robe.“Sirius! You’re supposed to be in bed still!” the blonde healer squeaked. She jumped at the sound of his voice, having not been paying attention so she did not see him exit the room she was heading to. She quickly put the present behind her back with a smirk.“You know I can’t sleep when you’re gone.” The older man spoke lowly, reaching forward to rest one hand on her cheek so he could pull her in for a kiss. It was gentle, and not as rough and passionate as he really wanted to. It was soft, a quick peck before he pulled away to look down at her.Adelaide giggled softly against his lips. “Sirius, you know I wanted to surprise you!” she whispered, shaking her head a bit before bringing her hand around, no longer hiding the box behind her back.“Happy Birthday.”“You did not have to get me anything, love.”“Are you mad?” Adelaide playfully slapped his arm before nudging him back into their bedroom. She closed the door gently behind them, only walking around when she heard the gentle click. “Of course, I was going to get you something. You only turn thirty-six once!” she teased, collapsing onto the bed as she began curling back up in the deep red, silk sheets.Sirius was beaming from ear to ear and there was something about the childish look of happiness and wonder on his face that warmed Adelaide’s heart. She had never seen him look so happy.“Well, go on!” Adelaide leaned over to nudge his side playfully. “Aren’t you going to open it?”Sirius chuckled. He took great care of the wrapping paper as he opened the box. The edges were crisp and folded perfectly, so much so that he was beginning to wonder if she had done this manually or with magic. He wouldn’t dare ask her and risk her getting mad at him for insinuating she had to use magic to do something this perfect, though. He wasn’t that stupid.“Oh, Addy!” Sirius was beaming again. Inside of the box was a pristine, authentic first edition of The Beatles’ ‘White Album’. Back when he was a teenager, Sirius listened to this album religiously alongside the rest of the Marauders.Music had always been his outlet whether it was for pain, grief, or even love. Though to be quite honest, sitting here with Adelaide now… he knew he never really understood true romantic love. Atleast not until he met her.He knew the love of friendship. And really, for Sirius, that was all that he needed. Because those friends quickly became his family. A bond that he swore would never be broken. A bond stronger than the relationship he had with any of his blood relatives.“Adelaide.” Sirius had gentle set the album back into the box, put the box on the floor, before he turned and pounced onto Adelaide. His arms wrapped tight around her, pressing himself into her as he took in her scent. She smelled like cinnamon sugar and lavender. It was a strange combination, sure – but he loved it. The way the scent of lavender wafted through the hair anything she let her hair down from the bun or braid it had been held back in.The way her skin smelt of cinnamon sugar. A particular body scrub product she had come across while shopping in muggle London with Andromeda. The scrub not only caused her to smell like a glorious Christmas cookie, but also made her skin as smooth as a newborn’s bottom.“Godric, I love you.” the man’s voice was muffled against her chest, his eyes tightly shut as his hands held her sides, keeping her locked in place.“I love you, too.” Adelaide was smiling proudly. She was glad that this birthday was already off to a great start. Things were really starting to get out of hand with the impending war. Adelaide was unsure of how much normal time that they all had left with one another.“This is the best bloody present I could have ever asked for.” Sirius told her, pulling back so he could breathe normally again. As he did so, he looked up at her with a wide grin. “Truly. You spoil me. How did you know I lost that album?”“Remus.” Adelaide mused with a smirk. “Plus, I may have checked out your record collection when you weren’t paying attention. I remember hearing you both talk about this one, so I tracked a copy down for you.”Sirius leaned down and began peppering kisses along her jawline, her cheek, and anywhere else he could reach. “You are fantastic, love.”“Hmm. I know.” she giggled softly and wrapped her arms around his shoulders, enjoying the closeness.“Now I’ve got to find you the best birthday present this year now.” Sirius teased, “I’ve got to beat you at your own damn game.”“I’ve been the best gift giver for my entire life, Sirius. A thirty-six-year-old man is not going to beat me now.”“If you keep reminding me how bloody old I am, you’re going to get it!” Sirius groaned, though a chuckle was resonating in his chest. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► D E C E M B E R 1995“How does it feel to be twenty-three?” Adelaide looked up from her morning tea, a smirk appearing on her lips as she watched Charlie open a few little gifts for his birthday. It was the 12th of December already and time had been going too fast. Adelaide just wanted it to slow down. Each day that passed meant another day closer to the unknown.Adelaide tried her best to stay positive, but it was becoming increasingly hard. Hearing stories of the quite literal hell that Hogwarts was becoming sent shivers down her spine. Was the Ministry safe? Were they still in doubt that Lord Voldemort had returned?“Unfortunately, I do not feel any different than I did yesterday.” Charlie chuckled softly, his eyes taking in Adelaide’s appearance. She was dressed for work already, but he knew that she had almost two full hours before her shift began. “But it is nice to know I’m not older than you.”With a roll of her eyes, Adelaide picked up a chocolate croissant to place on her plate. “Only for a few more days, you git.” she laughed, tossing a piece of the croissant she had ripped off at him.Charlie let the flaky crust hit him square in the chest before picking it up from his lap and popping it in his mouth. The warm, buttery flavor began seeping its way into his taste buds. The one thing he really did miss most about home – his mum’s cooking. Actually, her baking, to be specific.“Speaking of,” Charlie cleared his throat and glanced back to Adelaide with a grin. “Any big plans for your special day?”“Sirius is making me dinner. But other than that, a quite night in.”“A quiet night in?” Charlie scoffed, “That does not sound like fun.”With a roll of her eyes, Adelaide finished up her beverage and moved to clean up after herself. “Very funny, Charlie.” The blonde sighed softly. The truth of the matter was that Adelaide couldn’t do more. Sirius was supposed to be ‘on the run’ and it seemed more and more that he was becoming permanently hidden from the Ministry.Adelaide truly loved the man. She really did. But she found it to be hard at times. She couldn’t tell anyone – outside of The Order – about him. Friends from work knew she had a beau, but she was forced to refuse to divulge any information about him.“Anyways,” Adelaide cleared her throat. “It’s not a special birthday. Just turning twenty-three.” She forced a smile as she leaned her elbows on the countertop, her chin propped up in the palms of her hands.“Nonsense!” Molly drifted in at the mention of Adelaide’s upcoming birthday not being a special one. “Every birthday, here on this earth, is a special one.” Molly whispered, wrapping her arms around Adelaide and holding her close to her side. “Sirius will make you dinner, and I’ll make dessert! How does that sound?”Adelaide laughed softly, hugging Molly back. “That sounds lovely, Molly. Thank you.”Molly beamed. She truly felt on cloud nine when she could take care of others. Even if it was something as simple as baking a cake, or a pie, Molly felt needed and that was always important to her.“That settles that.” The Weasley matriarch smiled and then moved over to give her son a hug and a kiss.December was shaping up to be uneventful.

J U L Y 1986, T H E B U R R O W“Mum, I’m thirteen!” Adelaide huffed loudly. The air that had escaped her lungs sent the bangs resting on her forehead up in the air.“Yes, I understand that.” Adele Corden peered up over the rim of her glasses, a soft sigh escaping her lips as she watched her daughter pace back and forth in front of their fireplace.Adelaide was begging to take the floo, by herself, to The Burrow. Charlie had invited her over to lunch and to possibly go swimming in the lake nearby. Adelaide was ecstatic about the invitation, even though she was extremely nervous. She had spent time at The Burrow before, but her parents were always around.“But just because you’re thirteen does not mean you can take the floo alone!” Adele continued, folding the copy of The Daily Prophet she had been reading and setting it back down on the coffee table.“It’s not like I can get lost, Mum! I’m not flying on a bloody broom, I’m taking the floo!” Adelaide cried, her hands flying up in the air out of frustration.“Don’t speak to me with that tone, young woman.” Adele watched her daughter with a glint of amusement in her eyes.“Sorry.” Adelaide sighed, chewing back her lower lip for a moment. “Mum, please. I’ll be fine, I promise. I know the rules. Speak loud and clear and I’ll have no problem getting to the burrow!”Over the past year, Adelaide began to feel a bit different towards Charlie. Maybe it was how tall he shot up in what seemed like a blink of an eye. Or maybe it was the way that he filled his clothes out more. Especially now that he had been seemingly playing more quidditch with his older brother, Bill.Of course, she had never spoken a word of this to anyone. Not a single soul. Not even her other best friend, Tonks.Adele was still watching her daughter trying to state her case. An amused smile forming on the matriarch’s lips. In all honesty from the start, Adele had known she was going to allow Adelaide to travel alone. She liked to tease her daughter and it was all in honest, harmless fun.Adelaide was pacing back and forth again, explaining to her mum as to why she was old, and mature, enough to take the floo by herself. Another ten minutes had passed by before Adele spoke up again.“Are you finished?”“What?”Adelaide looked over at her mum, her eyes widening just a bit.“You’re going to end up being late for lunch. And you know Mrs. Weasley would like for you to be on time.”“Wait…” Adelaide started to smile, “Does that mean I can take the floo by myself?” she all but screamed.“Yes, my love.” Adele laughed softly. She got up from the table and wrapped her arms around her daughter in a gentle hug. “Now get going. You don’t want to keep that friend of yours waiting too much longer.”Adelaide blushed a deep red. “Mum!” she cried. “Stop. Charlie is my best mate. Tonks, too. That’s all.”Adele smirked. She had pulled back from the hug, brushing strands of her daughters hair back from her face. “Whatever you say, my love. Now…” She tucked the strands behind her ears, brushing her thumb along her cheekbone lovingly. “Get going. I’ll see you later.”Adelaide was absolutely beaming. Forgetting about the mention of Charlie being anything more than just her best friend, Adelaide jumped up, kissed her mum goodbye and grabbed a handful of floo powder. Within the next minute she had tossed the powder down, stepped in and shouted out “The Burrow!”Adelaide found herself clutching her mouth throughout her travels. The feeling was strange this time around. Maybe it was because she was by herself and not clutching onto her father or mum, but the tingling sensation running along her arms and up her neck was causing her to feel a bit queasy.“Addy! Addy! Addy!”Stepping out of fireplace, Adelaide was almost knocked onto her bum as four-year-old Ginny Weasley came bounding over to her, hugging her legs tightly.“Ginny!” Adelaide giggled, reaching down to lift the little girl up in her arms, holding her up against her hip.“Oh, Adelaide! You look so grown up.” Molly walked over to the duo, wiping her hands, and drying them off on her apron. “Ginny, leave the poor girl alone, she only just stepped through the floo.” Molly had reached out to peel Ginny from holding onto Adelaide. She set her down and ushered her away from their guest.“Oh, she’s ok Mrs. Weasley.” Adelaide giggled softly, tucking strands of hair that had become disheveled during her travel through the floo.“Molly, dear. Please call me Molly.” The matriarch grinned widely, now guiding the blonde through the living room and into the kitchen.“Charlie is out back. The boys are playing some quidditch right now. I think they wanted to work up a sweat before they went for a swim. The lake is probably the temperature of a nice warm bath in this weather.” Molly perched her hands on the counter by the sink, standing a bit taller on the tips of her toes to peer out the window.Adelaide joined her with a smile. Molly was right. All the eldest Weasley boys, Mr. Weasley included, were outside on their brooms. Percy, Ronald, George, and Fred were watching from the side of the house cheering on their brothers and father.“Godric knows one of these boys is going to get hurt one of these days.” Molly sighed, shaking her head. “But… that’s what I get for having a house full of them. Why don’t you take this lemonade out to them?” Molly shuffled over to the refrigerator, plucked out the pitcher of the pale-yellow sugary drink before setting it down on a serving tray. She flicked her wand, wordlessly summoning a few glasses to settle on the tray beside the pitcher before shooing Adelaide out the back door.“Addy!” Charlie cried from his position up on his broom, hovering beneath Bill and his father, Arthur.“Ooohh, Addy!” Billy cooed, puckering up his lips to start making smooching noises but soon went quiet when Charlie angrily stared up at him and his father told him to settle down.Adelaide felt her cheeks become hot at Bill’s teasing, slowly moving to set the tray of lemonade down on the picnic table before pouring the drink into all the glasses.“Hiya Charlie!” Adelaide finally called back, giving her friend a small wave before sitting down on the bench besides Ron.Charlie quickly, and safely, landed on the ground. He set his broom off to the side of the shed before making his way over to the picnic table.Adelaide stood up, ruffling Ron’s hair before greeting Charlie with a tight hug.“I’ve missed you, you git.” Adelaide whispered with a soft laugh.“I’m not a git!” Charlie groaned, though he began laughing as well. “And I’ve missed you too. You don’t live too far away, you know. We should hang out more often in the summer. I sent an owl to Tonks but I don’t think she’s going to make it today.”Adelaide nodded. “Yeah, she said that her Mum and Dad was taking her to visit some of her dad’s family In London.” She pulled back from the hug, wrinkling her nose in disgust. “How long have you guys been flying around up there? You stink!”Charlie lifted his arms, craning his neck to try and get a better whiff of under his arms. “Not that long!” he complained, though a laugh soon escaped his lips as he watched Adelaide take a step back now that Bill was standing beside them. The blonde was pinching her nose dramatically.“Godric, let’s get you lot to the lake. Maybe I should grab some soap.” Adelaide teased, a smirk forming on her lips as she turned around, holding her hand out to Ron so he could take it as they skipped through the grass. As they headed towards the lake, Molly stepped out with Ginny knowing the young girl would complain that she was not hanging out with Adelaide. The youngest redhead could care less about her brothers, and always found herself following Adelaide when she spent time with them.“Your girlfriend is a bit rude, don’t you think Charlie?” Bill teased.“She’s not my girlfriend, Bill.” Charlie glared at his older brother before trudging alongside him as they followed the rest of their family towards the lake.Adelaide felt grateful that she had found Charlie and Tonks during her first year. They were all in separate houses, but to this day remained as thick as thieves. Adelaide hoped that it would always be like that. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► “You can’t catch me!” Ginny squealed, splashing through the water as she tried to hide behind her father while holding onto the waist band of his swim trunks.Charlie continued splashing as hard and fast as he could, grinning like a mad man as the giggles erupted out of his little sister.“Dad won’t be able to protect you forever!” he teased, trying to splash her some more before he felt a sudden weight on his back.Craning his neck to the side, Adelaide stuck her tongue out as they made eye contact. Both of her arms and legs were now wrapped tightly around Charlie as the blonde clung to his back.“Run Ginny! I’ll save you!” Adelaide giggled, still clutching tightly onto Charlie before she tried to lean back while holding onto him, using her body weight to the best of her ability to dunk him beneath the water.Charlie let her win, of course. He would always let her win. No matter what the game was. Well, ok, maybe that was not always the case. Because Adelaide always beat him at every game of wizard’s chess. And that was always, always, fair and square. Charlie liked to chalk it up to the fact that his best friend was in Ravenclaw, but he knew it was because she was just good.“Thanks Addy!” Ginny giggled, wading through the water as she headed to the shore, splashing her other older brothers as she went.After coming up for air, Adelaide brushed her hair back from her face. Droplets of water locked themselves on her lashes before she rubbed her eyes and grinned up at Charlie.“Got ya!”“That’s because I let you get me!” Charlie splashed her playfully before he found himself walking back towards the shore. His family was starting to dry off and get ready to head back to the house for lunch. Adelaide was the only one left in the water. She loved the water, and because she did not have a lake nearby her own home – which in reality was not that far away from The Burrow – she wanted to take advantage of it.“Addy! Are you coming? Mum’s going to have lunch ready soon.” Charlie called over his shoulder, moving to grab a towel to wrap around himself to dry off. He was oblivious to the wandering blue eyes of his best friend watching the muscles in his back move as he wrapped the towel around his shoulders. Puberty had done wonders for not only herself but for Charlie, as well.“Yeah, I’ll be right ou-“Adelaide was cut off, something lurking beneath the water took a nibble at her feet. This caused her to let out a blood-curdling scream, arms flying in the air as she started rushing to solid, dry land.“Addy! What is it?” Charlie dropped his towel and rushed forward, arms circling around her waist as he lifted her the rest of the way out of the water. He set her down and inspected the bottom of her foot. It was red, and slightly irritated but the skin had not been broken.“Something bit me! Am I bleeding? Am I going to have to lose my foot?” Adelaide began crying. She knew she was being a bit dramatic, but the sudden sensation of little teeth pricking the sensitive skin of her foot had truly frightened her.“Addy, relax, relax.” Charlie cooed, his hand resting on her leg as he watched her. “You are completely fine. Whatever it was didn’t break the skin.” He told her with a reassuring smile. “Do you want me to go see if I can find what it was?”Adelaide wiped at her cheeks, slightly embarrassed that she freaked out like she did. Magical creatures were not something she found herself drawn to and quite honestly, she got freaked out a bit too easily over most of the creatures they studied at school.“Yes… please.” The blonde cleared the throat, further inspecting her foot for a moment before she watched Charlie wade back into the water. He dove in and swam around until he found the culprit. There were no other living things swimming nearby but this – a small, round fish that had two legs with webbed feet. A Plimpy, from what he gathered.“Plimpy!” Charlie called out once he broke through the surface. “It was a bloody Plimpy, Addy. You’re going to be just fine.” He couldn’t help but laugh a bit, coming back out of the water. He moved to sit beside her, wrapping her up in the towel before leaning back on his elbows with a sigh.“Plimpy?” Adelaide repeated, scrunching her nose up at the name of the creature. “That’s a weird bloody name. Are you sure it’s not poisonous?”“I’m positive.” Charlie laughed.Once she was able to dry her body off, Adelaide tied her hair back in a braid and glanced over at Charlie. His head was tilted back, exposing his throat as his eyes were shut. She took this time to admire him – this time at a much closer distance than last time. She felt like he had changed so much in just the few weeks that they had not seen one another.Was what she was thinking normal? Was it normal to think about your best friend in a romantic light? No, right? She didn’t think so… It was a strange feeling. Maybe it was just the hormones. Puberty was horrendous. Adelaide didn’t have any older sisters, or cousins even, to talk about this kind of stuff with.She had Tonks… but – let’s face it… Tonks was certainly not interested in the same things that she was interested in. Atleast not right now. The second a boy looked at Tonks she would sneer and snap her teeth at him as though she was some sort of animal. The poor soul who tried to flirt with her would be lucky if she didn’t transform her face into whatever animal she had been thinking about as she growled at them.Adelaide loved her, though. And she loved Charlie, too. She knew she could never act on the thoughts and feelings she was having. She would never be able to forgive herself if she ended up ruining their friendship.“Hey Charlie?”“Hm?”The redhead didn’t bother to open his eyes, but Adelaide knew he was listening.“Do you promise to not make fun of me next year in Kettleburn’s class?” the blonde laughed softly.Opening one eye, Charlie glanced over at his best friend.“Of course, Addy. I promise to only laugh once…maybe twice.” He teased.“I’m serious, Charlie! I know I can trust you to help me… Tonks…well, I’ll probably have to bribe her with something. Probably money.” Adelaide sighed, though a laugh escaped her lips. She glanced over her shoulder as she heard their names being called from the open back door of Charlie’s home.They got up together and started heading back to the house.“Don’t worry. I’ll protect you from all the Plimpies’ of the world. I promise.”

D E C E M B E R 1995, G R I M M A U L D P L A C E“Do you remember the first time I saw you?”Adelaide and Sirius were lying in bed together with their bare bodies hidden beneath the sheets. The healer’s hair was messily thrown up into a bun on the top of her head as the side of her face pressed into Sirius’ chest.“The very first time?”Sirius found himself smiling at the thought. He would never forget the moment that he first laid eyes on her. Even if she had been passed out on the moving staircase just before the Gryffindor portrait hole. Her pale skin was bright and clear of imperfection. Her hair was tied in a tight bun at the nape of her neck, and she looked so innocent. They both found it odd that she had passed out when she did. They still did not know the reasoning – she had not had another fainting spell since the first.“Yes, you git. Now tell me.” Adelaide let out a soft laugh escape her lips as she tilted her head back, looking at him now.“You were beautiful. Even though I was technically Padfoot when I laid eyes on you for the first time… I knew that there was something special about you.” Sirius let his fingertips run along her back, tracing patterns against her smooth skin.“And the way that you brought me food, took care of me… believed me when I had nobody…” Sirius found himself becoming emotional. He had been alone, completely alone, for so long. Then in waltzed Adelaide Corden. Innocent, young Adelaide. She went to bat for him, even turned her wand against Severus for him. He knew that was not something that came easy for her.She was not a fighter. No matter how much she wanted to be… she just wasn’t. Strong-willed, sure. An excellent healer. The best one he had ever met. And no, he did not just think that because he fell in love with her. She had brilliant bedside manner, gentle hands, and a genuine caring smile. She was extremely intelligent, too. He enjoyed watching her go back and forth with Remus. It was about bloody time that someone gave him a run for his money!Adelaide’s eyes filled to the brim with warm tears. She refused to let them fall and buried her face into the crook of his neck as she cuddled herself into his side.“When I left you on the top of that tower in that bloody cell…” the blonde spoke after a few moments of peaceful silence. “I don’t know if I had ever felt that kind of heartbreak before.” She admitted to him. Her fingers splayed out on his side as she held herself against him firmly.“I had only just found you… And even though we were meeting in secret, those nights were what I looked forward to the most.”Sirius could not help but feel his heart swell at her admission. He was truly lucky to have found someone like Adelaide. Even after all this time he still did not feel worthy of her and her love.“When this bloody war is over,” she began, slowly shifting to lean up so she could look down at him. “And you’re a free man…” Her hands slipped along his chest, tracing the runes tattooed into his skin as she watched him shiver under her touch. “You’re going to be a free man.”Sirius’ insides melted at the thought of being a free man. Not just any kind of free man. A free man with her by his side. He had once made her the promise that he would make an honest woman out of her once that happened. If anything, Sirius Black was a man of his word.“I love you.” Sirius whispered up to her, his head resting into the pillow beneath him as he looked up at her. Adelaide slipped herself onto his thighs, cupping his face firmly as she pressed her lips against his.“And I you.” Adelaide whispered back, barely removing her lips from his as his arms tightened around her. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► Three hours had passed, and Sirius was now sitting up with a book in his lap, the sheets loosely laid across his legs keeping his modesty covered.Adelaide was just slipping back into the room with two mugs of tea and some sweets, magically levitating behind her, following her through the doorway. With a flick of her wand the mugs and sweets separated, half going to Sirius and the other setting down on the bedside table on her side.“It’s officially the eighteenth now.”Sirius looked to the clock on the wall across from them, gesturing to Adelaide that the time was just about ten minutes past midnight.“Ah, so it is.” Adelaide sighed, though a small smile appeared on her lips as she slipped back into bed. She kept the velvet robe tied around her small frame, enjoying the extra warmth it was providing her.“Happy Birthday, love.” Sirius rested a hand on the side of her face, brushing his thumb against her cheekbone before he leaned in and captured her lips with his. “I’ve got you something.”Adelaide kissed him back gently, a smile appearing on her lips again as she pulled back to watch him shuffle out of bed and open the top drawer of his dresser.“I don’t need anymore of your clothes, Sirius.” The blonde teased. She leaned over and picked up her mug of tea, swirling the spoonful of honey before plucking it out once all the honey had melted into the ceramic. A small sip later, Adelaide was watching Sirius with curious eyes.“Very funny, Addy.” Sirius rolled his eyes in a playful manner. He turned around and Adelaide could see one hand remained behind his back.“It’s not something that the twins made you buy off them, is it? I don’t think I can handle any fireworks going off in my face and singing my eyebrows…again.”“Again?” Sirius repeated. A laugh escaped his lips at the thought, though he shook his head and moved to sit beside her. “Save that story for another time, I’m curious now.”Adelaide nudged him with her foot, sitting up straight as she continued watching him. “Well… what is it? The suspense is killing me!”Sirius took another moment of making Adelaide wait before he presented her with her birthday present.“I thought long and hard about what the best gift for you would be. I know you’re not a materialistic person, Addy, but I wanted to give you something that you could always have with you. Something that means a lot to me.” Sirius turned his hand, opening his palm to present a small jewelry box.“Sirius…”Opening the box to show her what was inside, Sirius smiled warmly. “This is the Black family signet ring.”An odd sensation washed over Adelaide. She pulled herself up some more, now sitting crisscross in front of Sirius. She reached over and took the ring from the box. Turning the gold and black ring around in her fingers as she further inspected it, Adelaide looked up to Sirius. “I thought you got rid of this ring in the summer?”Sirius sighed. “Originally I did throw it away.” He closed the box after removing a dainty gold chain from beneath the plush velvet insert and set it down on the bedside table. “It belonged to my father.” Sirius spoke of the man with such disgust – Adelaide understood that his family was an extremely sore subject.“But… I began to think about things. Our future… together. The future of the Black family name.” Sirius reached over to take the ring, staring down at it in silence for another moment before he looped the chain into the ring.“May I?”Adelaide smiled. She nodded silently and turned to face away from him. She found herself closing her eyes and placing her hand against the ring as it rested on her chest as Sirius clasped the chain behind her.“Often times it’s hard to forget about my horrible childhood and how much I loathed my family…” Sirius let his fingertips slip along the side of her neck for a moment before she turned back around to face him again. “But when I sit back and think about the reality of it all, I know that they are no longer here to ruin the good that I have left.”“Oh, Sirius.” Adelaide reached over and slipped her hand into his, pulling it into her lap as she watched him, listening intently to his reasoning behind the gift.“I want the future of House Black to be a bright one. Not dark and dingy like it’s past.” He continued, lacing his fingers in with hers as he gave her hand a gentle squeeze.“I love it.” Adelaide reassured him, squeezing his hand back tightly. “And I love you. Thank you.”The blonde leaned over and pressed her lips against his gently. “I love you so much.” she told him, her hand pulling out of his grasp so she could cup his face and keep him close.She pressed into him with another kiss. This second time around was more fervent than the last. Her fingers soon found their way into his hair, weaving through the dark brown curls before she leaned back and pulled him with her.Sirius had just about gotten his robe off from her shoulders when there was a loud and frantic knock at the door. Groaning out of frustration, Sirius pulled his head back to look down at her.“Ignore it.” He whispered before capturing her lips in a passionate kiss again.Adelaide tried her best to ignore, her hands staying locked in his locks before they started traveling to his shoulders. The knocking seemed to have stopped for a moment and Sirius resumed with undressing the woman beneath him before it started up again.“Bloody hell.” Adelaide muttered, a sigh escaping her lips before she pressed her hand against her forehead. She was just about to push Sirius off as the door burst open.Charlie stood there, eyes wide. Adelaide quickly sat up, nudging Sirius so he could sit beside her. “Charlie! You can’t just barge in like this.” Adelaide cried, quickly tightening the robe around her shoulders to hide her bare body beneath the plush material.It took her a moment to really see Charlie’s face. His eyes were red and bloodshot. Tears were brimming and already beginning to leak out, streaking down his cheeks.Sirius’ face was beet red – not from embarrassment, but from anger. He stood up to kick Charlie out before he also noticed the look on the redhead’s face.“Charlie?” Adelaide was standing now. Slowly moving towards him in the doorway. “W-What is it?”“It’s not Harry, is it? What happened?” Sirius spoke up, quickly walking towards the doorway as well, just a few steps behind Adelaide now.“N-No.” Charlie shook his head and cleared his throat. He rubbed roughly at his eyes, trying to ignore the stinging sensation the tears were causing him. “Harry is ok. It’s not Harry.” He continued.“Charlie, please. You’re scaring me. What is it?”Sirius tried to ignore the jealousy in the pit of his stomach as he watched Adelaide reach for Charlie, grabbing his hands in hers.“It’s my father.” The second eldest Weasley was finally about to get it out. “H-He’s been taken to St. Mungos.”Sirius took in a deep breath, opening his mouth to speak before he was cut off by a blur of blonde hair rushing past him to the closet.“I’m getting changed and I’ll head in.” Adelaide called from the closet, hustling to get changed out of the robe and into her work uniform.“It was an attack. He was at work, guarding the prophecy. Snape is downstairs. He must have taken the floo from Dumbledore’s office to tell us. Apparently, Harry had a dream about it and… it was real. I-I don’t understand.” Charlie was beginning to sound frantic. He had never lost anyone close to him and the thought of losing his father was beginning to send panic throughout.“Love, are you sure you should head in?” Sirius turned from Charlie to watch Adelaide slip her shoes on and kiss his cheek.“Arthur is like a second father to me, Sirius. I must go, I need to help. But I’ll send a patronus as soon as I know anything.” She promised with a sad smile.Charlie was already walking out of the room, running his fingers through his hair as he tried to center himself. He knew panicking would not help or make things any better.“Mum just left and sent word to Bill. I’m going with you. I’m not going to be able to sleep anyway.”Adelaide nodded, glancing over her shoulder to look at Sirius one last time before she grabbed onto Charlie’s elbow and rushed down the staircase with him. 

The time between first stepping into the fireplace at Grimmauld Place and exiting in the atrium of St. Mungos was only two minutes. For Charlie, it felt like hours. His palms were sweaty, and his skin was a deathly pale shade of white. Was this the end for his father? Charlie never had to deal with something so serious like this in Romania.Sure, his friends had gotten hurt, as did he, but there was never an instance that Charlie felt like he was going to lose someone he loved.“Healer Corden?”Maggie Simon, one of the bright and bubbly young receptionists at St. Mungos stood up from behind her desk with wide eyes. The brunette glanced between Adelaide and Charlie with a confused look on her face.“You’re not supposed to be working today! It’s your birthday!”Adelaide forced a smile. She liked Maggie. The girl was a complete sweetheart – but right now the last thing she wanted to do was think about something happy like celebrating her birthday.Adelaide tightened her grip on Charlie’s elbow, tugging him along with her as she walked up to Maggie and the front desk.“Maggie, hi.” Adelaide sighed softly, “Have you heard any word about an Arthur Weasley?”Charlie felt numb – he had almost missed the fact that it was Adelaide’s birthday. He had been so shellshocked about his father’s attack that he did not realize that it had already passed the midnight hour.“A new patient?”Adelaide nodded. She stood in silence as she watched Maggie flick her wand through the stack of enchanted book that sat front and center of the desk. After a moment or two, Adelaide turned to look up at Charlie. She slipped her hand down and laced her fingers with his so she could give him a tight, reassuring squeeze.“He’s going to be ok, Charlie. Maggie here is going to tell us what floor he’s on and I’m going to help work on him…whatever needs to be done.”Charlie’s trance broke momentarily, his eyes tearing away from the wall he had been staring blankly at. Forcing a weak smile, Charlie gave Adelaide’s hand a squeeze in return. He wanted to speak up and thank her for jumping straight into action for him and his father, but he knew if he opened his mouth words may not be the first thing to escape. Charlie was fighting tears and the sobs that were trying to work their way out of his throat. He had never been this scared before.“Arthur Weasley, here we go.” Maggie finally spoke up, clearing her throat as she had noticed Adelaide and Charlie were looking at one another in silence and not at her. “He’s with Healer Conrad Becker on the sixth floor.”Adelaide thanked Maggie quickly, rushing towards the staircase with Charlie in tow. She held tightly onto his hand and rushed up each floor. The only sound that could be heard was the sound of their heavy breaths and their shoes hitting the concrete stairs as they ran.Once they made it to the sixth floor, Adelaide let go of Charlie’s hand. She watched him rush over to Molly and Bill and gave them all a nod before she rushed behind the double doors towards the room that they were working on Arthur in.She greeted Healer Becker and explained her reasoning for being there. Once she got the green light to get involved, she had taken a few more steps into the room to stand beside Arthur. He had been put to sleep by a spell that usually wore off under four hours. It was easier this way to heal extensive wounds like the ones he had sustained.“How long have you known Mr. Weasley?” Healer Becker looked up as he spoke. His green eyes bright under the lights above them as he waited for Adelaide to answer his question.“Since I was a first year in Hogwarts. He is friends with my father, as well. His son Charlie is my best friend.” Adelaide smiled softly as she brushed some hair from Arthur’s forehead before taking out her wand to perform a few diagnostic tests as Healer Beck continued working on the injury on Arthur’s arm.“Was he speaking when they brought him in? Did we figure out what happened?” Adelaide turned to the cart beside the bed, peering over the potions and slaves laid out for possible use. She picked up a small jar of salve and twisted the cap off so she could scoop a small bit out onto her fingertips. “They look like snake bites.”“That’s because they are.” Healer Becker stated. His tone was extremely flat, and his focus was directed on getting the gash on Arthur’s forearm to close properly and stay that way.What the bloody hell was a snake doing in the ministry? Adelaide tried to wrap her head around what a snake was doing in the ministry. Was this tied to the Dark Lord? Charlie didn’t explain anything else that Snape had told them, so Adelaide was a bit in the dark about the specifics.She turned to face Arthur again before working on healing the marks that littered the side of his neck and along his collarbone. They were not as deep as the ones on his arms, which Adelaide found herself silently thanking the stars above that he was not in worse state.It had taken a full hour to heal every wound Arthur sustained from the snake. Adelaide tucked her wand in the pocket of her uniform and helped Healer Becker with the paperwork on their treatment process and what Arthur’s recovery would have to look like.“I can handle the rest of the paperwork. I’m going to stick around until he wakes up and be with the family.” Adelaide explained to Healer Becker, a small smile forming on her lips as she watched the older gentleman gleefully tuck his wand into his pocket.He walked out of the room and Adelaide followed, heading to the front station to ensure that the right staff would go back and bring Arthur to his room for recovery.Once she had gotten that settled, she found herself standing in silence by the doorway. She wanted to gather her thoughts before talking to Molly, Bill, and Charlie. Although the outcome of healing Arthur was great, she knew that Molly would still be beside herself that her beloved husband had gotten injured in the first place.After collecting herself, Adelaide walked back down through the empty hallway and to the waiting room where the Weasleys’ were all pacing back and forth.“Addy!” Charlie spoke up as soon as he saw the healer walking in towards them.“Oh!” Molly stopped her pacing the moment she heard Charlie speak up. She turned to face Adelaide and forced a smile onto her face as she hurriedly shuffled over to her. “How is he? When can we see him? Is everything ok?”Adelaide took in a deep breath, resting a hand on Molly’s elbow as she gestured for her to sit down with her. “Arthur did great.” She began, her eyes moving from Molly to Bill, and finally landing on Charlie as he watched her with bated breath – a hopeful look in his eyes. “We were able to heal every wound. His arms took the brunt of the attack. He’ll have to stay here for a few days…”“Oh, is he going to miss Christmas?” Molly asked softly, a sad look in her eyes. She didn’t want her husband to miss Christmas with his children. After all, they had no idea if this would be the last Christmas they would be able to celebrate as a normal family.War took a lot from people. Molly, having been through the first wizarding war with Arthur and the rest of the order, know this firsthand. She lost her brothers, Fabian and Gideon. Her heart broke from this severe loss, and she didn’t feel like it had started to heal itself until Fred and George were born.“It’s like Fab and Gid have been reborn. I see the same mischievous spark in Freddie and Georgie’s eyes and they’re only five years old!” Molly told her husband one summer evening after Fred and George both played a few pranks on their older brothers. If you asked Molly right now what had happened, she couldn’t tell you the specifics. What she could tell you was that she had never felt so happy. Because in that very moment, she felt as though she was watching her younger brothers again.“No, no, he won’t miss Christmas.” Adelaide linked her arm into Molly’s and leaned her head against hers. “He’ll be home before then. I’ll make sure he’s got everything he needs. I’ve actually got a lot of stuff back at Grimmauld Place so if he needs anything at all, he’ll be covered.” She reassured the Weasley Matriarch, glancing up to Bill and Charlie with a smile.“Thanks Addy. Truly. You have grown into a magnificent young woman and an even better healer. We’re luck to have you.” Bill grinned, resting his hand on her knee for a moment to give her a friendly squeeze.“Jeez, Bill, you’re acting like you’re that much older than me.” Adelaide laughed, swatting his hand away from her knee.Charlie laughed to himself at this exchange between his brother and best friend. He crossed his arms over his chest and rested himself against the wall beside the set of chairs Adelaide and his mum were sitting in.“Anyway,” Adelaide cleared her throat and sat up a bit more straight in her chair, removing her arm from Molly as she looked up at Charlie with a smile. “Arthur has been moved to room six. Molly, you and the boys can head back to see him. I’ll be right behind you.”Molly stood up from her chair but had bent down to give Adelaide a kiss on her forehead, a smile growing on her lips as she pulled back. “You know, Bill is right. You really have grown into a magnificent young woman.” She told her with a soft laugh.Bill followed after his Mum quickly, giving Charlie a nod as he went.“You’re not joining them?” Adelaide looked up to Charlie as soon as she realized he hadn’t moved from the spot beside her.“Not yet.” Charlie shook his head and dropped down into the chair that his Mum had just been seated in. “I wanted to wish you a happy birthday.”Adelaide smiled. “Thanks Charlie.”“I know in the past…” Charlie took in a deep breath, willing himself to continue with this conversation. “I’ve been a git.”“That’s an understatement, Charlie.”“Yeah, yeah, I know. I’m just, so bloody grateful that you came here and helped heal my father.” Charlie turned inward to face Adelaide better. He reached over and slipped his hand over hers. Her small hand fit so nicely underneath his large hand. It had been quite some time since he felt the warmth of a woman’s touch. Right now, it wasn’t romantic. Really, in a sense it was some kind of platonic romance between himself and Adelaide.“You didn’t have to do this, is what I’m saying. For Godric sakes, it’s your birthday. And I know you’d rather be back at home with Sirius than here with me.”Adelaide couldn’t ignore the sense of sadness behind Charlie’s words. “Charlie,” she began, turning her hand over and lacing her fingers with his. She slipped her other hand over their conjoined ones and looked up at him. “You have to stop with those little comments.” She told him with a sigh. “The passive aggressive behavior has just got to stop. We’re too old to deal with that. We’re best friends, Charlie.”Charlie chewed on his bottom lip, instantly feeling regret from what he said. “Sorry.”“It’s fine.” Adelaide shrugged her shoulders, leaning over to rest her head on Charlie’s shoulder. She held his hand still, giving him a reassuring squeeze as she kept them in her lap. “As I was saying, we’re best friends. Nothing is ever going to change that. Even if I’m still bloody mad at you for leaving me the way you did.”Charlie groaned playfully. “I’m never going to live that down, am I?”“No. Never. I mean, I’m pretty sure my headstone is going to have a little blurb that says, ‘here lies Adelaide Corden’, or you know whatever my last name at that point of my life is, ‘beloved friend of everyone but that sodding Charles Weasley’.”Charlie let out a loud laugh. “Ah, well, I guess I deserve that.” He was debating on ignoring her mention about a change of last name but knew he couldn’t.“Black?” he spoke up after another minute of silence.“Hm?”“Black. Your possible future last name.”Chewing on her bottom lip, Adelaide let her eyes fall shut at the thought of getting married to Sirius. Ever since she was a little girl, she had dreamed of the day she married her soulmate. She didn’t plan on living through a war with an evil, dark lord. She thought pursuing her career of being a healer would mean that was going to be the extent of all the injuries and death she’d have to deal with.“Adelaide Black.” Her voice was low. She was afraid of any of the hospital staff overhearing their conversation. “It sounds weird. But… kind of nice. I think.”Charlie forced a smile. He gave her hand a squeeze and let his head rest against hers. “It does sounds nice, Addy. You love him. He loves you. I think we all need something to look forward to with this war on the horizon.”The two stayed like this for a few more minutes. Comfortable silence passed them by, and it wasn’t until Adelaide felt herself drifting off that she jolted upwards.“Shit, I’m sorry.” She laughed softly, removing her hands from his as she rubbed at her face. “I didn’t realize I would be able to fall asleep so quickly.”“I was just about to drift off to dreamland, too. But I-uh, I’m going to go ahead and see Dad.” Charlie rubbed at the side of his neck, twisting his head from side to side to stretch out a bit before he moved to stand up. “Let me walk you out?”Adelaide stood up, shaking her head. “No, don’t worry about me, Charlie. Go ahead and see your Dad. I’ll see you back at the house.” She looked up at him and without a second thought reached up to wrap her arms around his neck. She pulled him down and pressed her head into his chest. She could see that his eyes were still bloodshot from all the crying he did. Adelaide had always been good at comforting her loved ones.Charlie let his hands fall to Adelaide’s waist. Holding her up against him firmly, he let his chin rest on the top of her head. This felt nice… the feeling of her body against his after a long and stressful evening was comforting. The emotions of the night started bubbling back up in his chest.As if Adelaide knew what Charlie was feeling, her arms tightened around him, and she helped him back down into a chair. Her arms stayed around his neck as she cradled his head against her chest. “It’s ok, Charlie. Let it out.” She whispered down to him, stepping in between his legs so she could stand comfortably before him.Feeling protected in Adelaide’s arms, Charlie let his eyes fall shut as he listened to the sound of the beating of her heart. The feeling of almost losing his father was something Charlie never wanted to go through again. The thoughts kept swirling in his mind of losing everyone he loved, including Adelaide and Tonks. He had been the reason their friendship fell out – he ran off to Romania without telling her. The sinking feeling that maybe things would be completely different with Adelaide if he had not been scared of telling her his plans erupted within him and he immediately tried to will the hot tears away.“Things are going to be ok. As long as we have each other.” Adelaide told him, leaning down to gently press her lips against the top of his head. While Adelaide was comforting Charlie on the outside, on the inside she was trying to make herself believe the words spilling out of her mouth.   

Arthur had been discharged home from St. Mungos on December 24th. Christmas Eve. Adelaide, of course, was already on schedule and had been able to end her shift with Arthur, making sure he was good to go before taking him home.Getting there, though, was a bit harder than Adelaide had imagined. Arthur felt nauseous, most likely from having been in a hospital bed for the past few days, as well as all the nasty tasting blood-replenishing potions he had to force down his throat prior to discharge.Once they stepped foot in number twelve Grimmauld Place and out through the green flames, they were greeted by Molly, Charlie, Remus and Sirius.“Oh, Arthur!” Molly cooed, bustling through the group of men to make it over to her husband and Adelaide. “You’re looking much better, sweetheart.”“Thank you dear.” Arthur smiled weakly, leaning down to kiss his wife softly.Adelaide couldn’t help but tear up at the beautiful sign of affection between husband and wife. If everyone could have the kind of relationship like Molly and Arthur, the world would be a much better place.“And thank you!” Molly turned to Adelaide with a smile. “You’re an absolute angel, my dear. Isn’t that right boys?”Adelaide blushed profusely at Molly’s proclamation. She looked down at her feet for a moment before glancing up and looking between Remus, Sirius, and Charlie.“Yes, Molly, dear. Adelaide is in fact an angel.” Sirius grinned, strolling over to greet his girlfriend with a gentle kiss to her lips.“Hush.” Adelaide hissed, playfully slapping his hands away from her before she turned to face the rest of the room. “Arthur, you should probably go and rest. I’m going to get washed up and make sure we’re all stocked up for Christmas dinner tomorrow.” Adelaide gave Remus a hug and while walking past Charlie she had reached out and slipped her hand onto his forearm. She smiled up at him, earning a smile back from the tall redhead, before walking out of the room and up the stairs.Sirius watched from across the room, a soft sigh escaping his lips before he snapped out of it and walked over to help Molly walk Arthur up the stairs and to their bedroom. After he made sure Arthur was comfortable – he wanted to ensure he was the best host he could be – he ventured into the bedroom he shared with Adelaide.The blonde had just stepped out of the adjacent bathroom wrapped tightly in the velvet robe that belonged to Sirius.“I cannot believe it’s already Christmas Eve.” Adelaide sighed, sitting down at the vanity so she could work the brush through her hair. After doing so, she picked up her wand and cast a quick drying spell before pulling back her strands and tying them into a French braid.“Time flies when you’re having fun, love.” Sirius teased, a snort escaping his lips as he dropped onto the bed and stretched himself out with a groan.“These past few days have been anything but fun, Sirius.”The brunette looked over to Adelaide after hearing the aggravated sigh leave her lips. “What’s wrong?” he questioned.“I just don’t like how much, and how fast, things are changing. I’m…scared.” She admitted, chewing back on her bottom lip for a moment before she turned in the chair and looked over at him sprawled out across the bed.“Come here.” Sirius shifted up on his elbows, getting a better look at Adelaide from across the room.Listening immediately, Adelaide stood up and walked towards the bed. She stood beside it for a moment or two, just standing in silence watching him before she dropped onto the bed beside him, instantly curling up into his side with a sigh.“I’m always here for you, love. If you need to talk about anything, you know you can always talk to me.” Sirius whispered, his hand reaching up to cradle the side of her face as he held her against his chest.“I know that.” Adelaide spoke up after a moment of silence. It was obvious that she knew that Sirius was there for her. She never felt as safe as she did while she was in his arms.Well… she once felt this safe in Charlie’s arms – but she wasn’t going to go there. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► “Happy Christmas everyone!”Adelaide spoke cheerfully as she walked into the dining room, waving her hands at the group now seated at the table.“Happy Christmas Addy!”“You look lovely, Adelaide.”“Hermione, we’re not in class you don’t have to suck up.”“Shut up, Ronald.”Adelaide laughed. “Godric, did we fight like that when we were their age?” she turned to look at Charlie who was standing beside her father, helping him into his chair.Charlie laughed, shaking his head. “Is it bad that I can’t remember? It wasn’t that long ago…but I’m sure we did and with Tonks, it was probably ten times worse.”“Yeah, you’re probably right.” Adelaide smiled, moving to stand beside Arthur as she pulled at one of his bandages, just checking his healing process quickly before the Weasleys’ started exchanging gifts.Molly was so selfless. No matter what was going on, she dedicated time to knitting things for her family, sweaters, scarves, gloves, you name it – Molly knitted it. Adelaide helped Arthur down another blood-replenishing potion before discarding of the empty vial. As she turned back around, she caught a glimpse of Charlie tugging on his Christmas present that was in the form of a new ‘C’ sweater.“That red really brings out your eyes.” Adelaide teased him with a smirk, her elbow nudging him gently in the side before she graciously accepted the gift Molly was shoving into her arms. “Oh, Molly, you didn’t have to make me anything.”“Nonsense.” Molly smiled fondly, shaking her head as she rested against her husband. Adelaide could see just how happy Molly was that her husband was safe, on the road to recovery, and spending Christmas with their family.Stepping off to the side, Adelaide turned away from the group and opened the gift from Molly. Charlie lingered by her side, watching the happiness on his best friend’s face as she picked up the blue pair of gloves.“Blue was always your color.” Charlie whispered, a smile forming on his lips as he watched her try them on.“Thanks.” Adelaide smiled up at him as she tugged the gloves off and tucked them back neatly into the box before turning around as she heard Harry enter the room.Adelaide’s smile widened even more as she watched Sirius lean in against the doorframe. She walked past Fred and George, smacking their heads playfully as she went.“Happy Christmas, love.” Sirius greeted her with open arms, embracing her with a smile.“Happy Christmas, Sirius.” Adelaide whispered, resting her hands against his chest as she pulled back from his hug. She looked up at him, turning a bit as she watched him nod at Harry from over her shoulder. “He looks so happy.” She whispered, resting her head against his chest now.Sirius was about to respond before he heard Arthur clear his throat and speak up.“A Christmas toast!” Arthur smiled warmly at everyone in the room. “To Harry Potter…without him, I would not be here.”Adelaide kept her arm slipped around Sirius’ waist as she raised a glass in her free hand as Sirius did the same.There was not a dry eye in the room. To be honest, Molly might have enough tears to cover everyone who wasn’t getting emotional – Adelaide coming in at a close second.Adelaide gave Sirius’ side a gentle squeeze, looking up at him as they all cheered for Harry.Sirius smiled down to her, pressing his lips against her temple before giving a wink to his godson.As always, thanks to Molly, dinner was delicious. Adelaide found herself licking her lips thinking about the apple spice pie she had baked earlier with Ginny’s help. Dessert was always her favorite part of the meal.“What are you thinking about?” Sirius whispered over to her, a smirk twisting up on his lips as he leaned over and slipped his hand onto her knee.“Nothing like that you dirty dog.” Adelaide hissed, a giggle escaping her lips as she swatted his hand away from her.“Well, can you blame a man for hoping?”Glaring at him playfully, Adelaide rolled her eyes and went back to take the final sip of her glass of wine. She was relishing in the happiness exuding from everyone in the room. Her eyes fell on Charlie for a split second. The redhead was sitting besides his father, and they were talking about quidditch. The look of pure joy on Charlie’s face as he was spending time with his family made Adelaide’s heart skip a tiny beat.At the sound of the fireplace roaring to life, Adelaide turned and immediately shot out from her chair.“Mum! Dad!”The blonde rushed through the room and threw herself into her parents’ arms, a happy squeal leaving her lips as she pulled away. “I thought you both had to work and that I wouldn’t get to see you until tomorrow.”Faustus grinned. “Ah, well, the minister finally agreed to shut down my department for the Holiday. It just took us a bit longer to get ourselves ready.” The dark-haired male gestured to his wife, a laugh escaping his daughter’s lips as she instantly understood what he meant.“Faustus,” Adele narrowed her eyes at her husband. “Honestly, even with magic it’s not that easy to look perfect as fast as you want.”Sirius had stepped up behind Adelaide, nodding to Faustus before reaching forward to shake his hand. Faustus obliged, shaking Sirius’ hand tightly before stepping to the side and letting the man greet his wife.Faustus still was not the biggest fan of Sirius Black. He understood, and believed, that he was a innocent of the crimes he had been imprisoned for, but that did not mean he had to like him as his only daughter’s boyfriend. After all, he was closer in age with Sirius and Adelaide would always be his innocent, sweet little girl.“You look lovely, Adele.” Sirius told her with a smile, his hand slipping into Adelaide’s as he stood by her side.“Thank you, Sirius. You clean up nice yourself.” Adele smirked, gently patting her daughter’s cheek before walking over with her husband to Molly and Arthur.“I don’t think your father likes me, love.” Sirius muttered to Adelaide as he looked down at her. All he wanted was to be accepted by the Corden family. He loved Adelaide, and he thought it was obvious that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her and not just fool around for fun.Playing with the ring that hung around her neck with her free hand, Adelaide turned to look up at him. “Don’t think like that. My father is just protective. Trust me. He didn’t even like that I was friends with Charlie just because he was a boy.” She snorted softly at the memory of her mum telling her that her father had lost his temper at the first letter she sent home from Hogwarts.“Somehow that doesn’t make me feel much better.” He muttered beneath his breath. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► The rest of the night continued without issue. The twins were playing in the corner with a few of their newest products. Ginny and Hermione lingering behind them, laughing and gossiping about Merlin knows what. Adelaide, of course, had an idea.Harry and Ron sat at the table with Sirius, talking to him about Umbridge and everything that they were experiencing at Hogwarts thanks to the wretched witch herself.Adelaide lingered by the bar, a glass of wine loosely resting in her hand before she lifted it to her lips to finish it off. Licking her lips, removing the small bit of vino left over, Adelaide turned to pour herself some more before she was cut off by a large hand resting over hers as it clutched the bottle.“I think you’ve had enough.” Charlie whispered, chewing on his bottom lip as he watched Adelaide roll her eyes. She hated being told what to do – she knew her limits and she hated that Charlie seemed to forget that.“Charlie, please. This is only my third glass.” The healer muttered, gesturing to the glass in her other hand as she looked up at him.“Well, humor me. I’ve got your Christmas gift. Come with me?”Watching him for a moment, Adelaide was trying to figure out if he was just trying to keep her from drinking more, or if he really did have something to give her. After realizing that he was being sincere, she nodded. “Sure. Lead the way.”Adelaide followed Charlie out of the dining room and up the stairs to his room. She thought nothing of leaving without a word and was oblivious to Sirius’ watching eyes.“You’re making me feel bad, though,” Adelaide spoke up as she plopped down onto the bed with a sigh. “I didn’t get you anything for Christmas.”Charlie shrugged, “And I didn’t get you anything for your birthday.” He laughed, “So we’re even.”Charlie reached into the closet and pulled out a box. It was a shoebox, unwrapped, and looked worse for wear Adelaide raised a brow, “Shoes?” she teased.“You’re a bloody brat. No, I didn’t buy you shoes.” Charlie sat beside her, setting the box down between them.Adelaide smirked, glancing up at Charlie before she reached forward and plucked open the top of the box. Inside were two handheld mirrors, ornately decorated in black trim with specks of red in one and specks of blue in the other.After picking them up, flipping them around in her hand to check them out further, Adelaide looked back up at Charlie. Silently, her eyes were asking for an explanation, excited for what these meant.“Would you believe me if I told you that I’ve had these in this box since our last year at Hogwarts?”“What?” Adelaide exclaimed, covering her mouth quickly with her free hand. She had raised her voice a bit louder than she had anticipated. “What the bloody hell Charlie?”Feeling a rush of embarrassment, Charlie rubbed at the back of his neck for a moment before he picked up the second mirror, the one speckled with red on the back. “I know… trust me, I’m an arse for that. I meant to give these to you before I left for Romania. I meant to tell you I was leaving. I meant for a lot of things…”His voice trailed off as he tried to gather his thoughts. He didn’t want to be inappropriate with her like he had been in the past. But he was feeling nostalgic. To him, it felt as though they were back at Hogwarts, cuddled up in his bed in the boys’ Gryffindor dormitory and telling each other their secrets. The feelings he had for her that last year of school - if you asked him if he felt what he felt longer than that, he would vehemently deny it – felt like they were rushing back and he knew he needed to tamp them back down.Adelaide remained quiet. She let Charlie speak his mind, getting off everything he was feeling from his chest. She would be lying if she didn’t feel nostalgic herself, too.“Anyway,” Charlie cleared his throat before continuing, “These are not just plain old, any mirrors. They’ve been charmed to act as a communication beacon. So when I pick up this one,” He showed her, holding the mirror up closer to his face. “That one should feel warm to the touch and also give off a little vibration. So if it’s not close by, you will hear it go off.”Adelaide almost threw the mirror down, feeling the warmth before Charlie explained it to her. “Wow…” Suddenly she felt as though she was at a loss for words. She lifted the mirror up and a gasp escaped her lips as she saw Charlie’s face and not her own reflection. “Charlie, these are incredible!”With a weak smile, Charlie set the mirror back down. “I wanted you to have them both. I know now…after everything that I did to you, I don’t deserve to have that immediate connection to you.”A part of her agreed with him on that. Adelaide could think of a handful of people, other than Charlie, whom she would want this instant connection to. But then there was this other part of her, deep down within the hidden valley of her heart that knew Charlie was slowly starting to make up for all the heartache he had caused her. She just wanted her best friend back.Nothing would ever completely remove the memory of the heartache, of course, but she knew Charlie was working hard to earn back her trust… Earn back her love.“No, don’t…” Adelaide shook her head and set the mirror down so she could wrap her arms around Charlie. She was now leaning up on her knees, hugging him fiercely. She tried to will away the tears, but they started spilling down her cheeks anyway.“Thank you so much, Charlie. I love them so much.” She told him, her lips finding his cheek before she pulled back to look at him. And look at him she did. Her eyes found his, noticing that he was also beginning to tear up. She didn’t remember him being so soft, but she knew that things were changing drastically and that meant that the people she cared about were most likely going to change too.“I love you.” She told him softly. Her hands moved to cup either side of his face. “I want you to have the other mirror.”“Are you sure?” Charlie choked out, closing his eyes as he leaned his head forward. He was still ashamed of himself. He knew he had so much to attain, when it came to earning back her trust, and he was working so hard to do so. At this point he would do just about anything. That included stepping back and letting her be happy with Sirius Black.“Yes, I’m sure.” She whispered, pressing her lips against his forehead in a loving manner, platonically of course.“I love you, too, Addy. I really do. I’m so sorry for everything.” Charlie told her with a sigh. His eyes remained shut after feeling her lips against his forehead. It was a nice feeling. The feeling of forgiveness. Maybe they could get through this war together.“Let’s get back to the party, shall we?” Adelaide pulled back, placing her blue-speckled mirror back into the box. “I’ll drop this off in my room on the way down. Meet you at the stairs?”Charlie nodded with a smile. He sat there, slightly confused with his feelings, watching his best friend walk away and into the hallway. It took him another moment of internal warfare before he tucked the mirror into his bedside drawer, standing up from the side of his bed as he started exiting his bedroom.Standing by the top of the staircase, Charlie crossed his arms over his chest and occupied himself with looking around at the covered portraits that hung on the walls. After Adelaide exited her room and met Charlie at the stairs, they both made their way back downstairs.To be quite honest, Adelaide was starting to panic once she heard her father’s voice mixed with Sirius’. Whatever they were talking about could not be good. Atleast she made herself believe that.Once she stepped through the threshold of the dining room, she noticed that the voices were not coming from that room. Atleast the adults seemed to have disappeared, most likely now hanging out in the drawing room. She tried to take a step forward but was unable to move, her eyes widening as she peered up and saw the enchanted branch of mistletoe hanging over her head.She could hear Fred and George snickering in the corner, glancing over to them as they pointed to her. Smirks plastered over their faces and as soon as she heard Charlie stepping closer, she turned her head to warn him, but it was too late.“What’s wrong with you?” Charlie asked, still completely oblivious to the mistletoe swinging above his head.“That.” She told him, pointing up to the plant.“Oh, don’t be silly.” Charlie laughed, shaking his head as he moved to walk through the doorway but soon realized that this branch of mistletoe had been charmed to not allow anyone through the doorway without embracing in a kiss.“FRED! GEORGE!”

“Guys, come on. This is not funny. Uncharm the mistletoe. Right now.”Adelaide stood her ground, arms tightly crossed over her chest as she stared at the twins who were still grinning ear to ear.Charlie was no help, because a part of him found this to be comical as laughter left his lips. “You have to admit, Addy, it is kind of funny.”“Shut up, Charles, you’re not making this any better.” She hissed, smacking his chest as she glared up at him.“Ow! I’m sorry!” Charlie still laughed, though.Adelaide knew Fred and George were not going to remove the charm from the mistletoe – atleast not any time soon – so she took in a deep, calming breath. Looking around for a moment, she quickly reached up and pecked Charlie on the cheek.“Had to get it out of the way.” She muttered, moving to walk off but realized she was unable to do so.“What the bloody hell do I have to do to have my independence back?!” she cried, throwing her arms up in the air.Chewing on his bottom lip while he thought things through, Charlie quickly came to the conclusion that it had to be a real kiss. So without running it by Adelaide – because he knew she would protest- Charlie quickly cupped her face in his hands and pressed his lips against hers.The kiss should have been quick, but it wasn’t. Charlie felt Adelaide kiss him back, applying more pressure into the embrace before she pulled away and cleared her throat. The mistletoe shook above their heads, a soft bell jingle ringing out which meant the charm was lifted for the time being now that the kiss had happened.“Oh –“Adelaide turned around as soon as Charlie had pulled back from the kiss. She cleared her throat, refusing to look back at him before she stomped her way directly over to the two mischievous boys in the corner still snickering.“Bloody hell, she’s coming straight for us!” Fred cried, stumbling up from the chair and pushing George out of his way so he could scramble out of the room unscathed.“You wanker! You pushed me!” George groaned, now sprawled out on his stomach on the floor.Adelaide stepped right over him, immediately reaching for Fred, clutching him by the collar of his sweater before she nudged George’s leg with her foot. “You both are going to pay for this. You better knock it off the rest of the holiday.”Fred stared at Adelaide with wide eyes, knowing she was not playing around but still couldn’t help himself as laughter started bubbling up from his chest.“Yes ma’am.” Fred laughed, covering his mouth with one hand as he tried to release her grip on his sweater with the other.George remained on the ground, laughing hysterically as he stared up at Adelaide. The witch was trying her best to keep a straight face, though the twins could both see her resolve was starting to crack. She glanced between Fred and George and then reached down and pulled George up so he was standing beside her. The taller redhead was still standing in the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest and a grin spread wide upon his lips.“What?”“Why are you just standing there and not helping me?!”“You look like you’ve got it under control.” Charlie, too, was trying hard to keep a straight face. His eyes darted from Adelaide, who had one hand grasping Fred’s sweater tightly and now that George was standing, her other hand was holding onto him.“This is quite comical.” Charlie laughed again, shaking his head as he propped himself up against the wall.“What have we been missing?”Stepping through the door, Sirius glanced at Charlie before letting his gaze fall on Adelaide. He couldn’t help but laugh as he watched Adelaide struggle to keep hold of Fred and George who were both trying to pry her fists open to release their sweaters.Adelaide groaned, “These two wankers won’t stop with their bloody tricks and I’m trying to teach them a lesson.”Sirius laughed again. “Ah, well, love, why don’t you let them go and let their parents handle this.” He walked over, causing Adelaide to release the boys from her grip.Fred cried out, rubbing at his neck and George did the same. “Bloody mad woman! All we did was charm some mistletoe!”Sirius nudged them forward, gesturing for them to leave the room. Glancing between Adelaide and Charlie for a moment, Sirius let out a forced chuckle. “Ah, so I really did miss all the fun.”Charlie cleared his throat, turning to pour himself a drink. “Boys will be boys, I suppose.” He spoke over his shoulder, not wanting to look at Adelaide for too long. He was afraid that his expression would give away how much the kiss with her had meant to him, even if it had not been as long, or as passionate, as he would have liked.He promised Adelaide that he would not interfere in her relationship. If the only way he could be with her was to be her friend, then that was what he would try to do.“I don’t know how they’re not in detention every single night.” Adelaide muttered, a sigh escaping her lips as she moved to sit down at the table, pouring another glass of wine.“The Ravenclaw in you is probably screaming.” Charlie teased, a smirk forming on his lips before he decided to duck out of the room and give Sirius and Adelaide some space. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► The rest of the night passed without issue. After saying goodnight to her parents and the rest of the Weasley’s, Adelaide found herself cleaning up the messes leftover from the celebrations before walking up the stairs to her bedroom. The hallway was eerily quiet and all she could hear was the echoing of the tips of her heels clinking against the floorboards.She opened the bedroom door and closed it as quietly as possible. She would be lying if she said she didn’t think about the kiss shared with Charlie. It was different than the last kiss they shared – the one in the back alley of Hogsmeade when he was being a prick and just trying to shut her up.“You’re awake.” Her voice came out slow, eyes searching Sirius’ as he rolled over in the bed to look up at her. She had been cleaning up for atleast an hour or two. Not that she minded doing the tedious work, she refused help from anyone and almost forced Molly up the stairs by dragging her by her ear.“Couldn’t sleep.”“With the amount of brandy you drank tonight, I’m surprised.”Adelaide smirked as she kicked her heels off, ignoring the fact that one went flying towards the wall while the other tumbled beneath the bed. She slipped out of her dress and crawled into bed beside Sirius.“I behaved myself.” Sirius quipped back, a smirk growing on his lips as he reached forward and slipped his hand along her upper arm. “Unlike someone I know.”“What’s that supposed to mean?”Adelaide couldn’t help but shiver beneath his touch. There was something written on his face that she couldn’t quite grasp. Was he speaking about her? Was he angry? The only thing she could tell was that there was a small twinkle of mischief in his eyes.“You know what that’s supposed to mean, love. You misbehaved tonight.” Sirius spoke plainly. He wasn’t trying to play mind games. Not really, anyway. But he was enjoying seeing her squirm beneath his gaze.“Misbehaved? Me?” Adelaide feigned surprise. A part of her knew what he was referencing to.“Yes. You.”Adelaide shook her head. “What are you getting at, Sirius?”“Answer me this,” Sirius began, shifting now to let his fingers grasp her braid, tugging the elastic from the ends to release her hair. “Did you enjoy it?”“What?” Adelaide felt her blood run cold. Her eyes fell shut at the intrusion of his fingertips raking through her hair, unweaving the strands of hair she had tied back away from her face. “Enjoy what? Misbehaving?” She snorted before trying to regain her composure.“Did you enjoy kissing him?”Instantly, Adelaide felt herself freeze. She opened her eyes and looked up at him, immediately making eye contact because Sirius was already staring down at her, his eyes dark and narrowed.“Sirius, please.” Adelaide reached up and wrapped her fingers around his wrist, keeping his hand on the side of her face. She was beginning to think he was just messing with her. And maybe he was. But she could also sense a slight shimmer of sadness, maybe even hurt, behind his eyes. “The mistletoe…”“I know what happened with the mistletoe, love.” Sirius cut her off, his finger tangled in the curled tresses of her blonde hair now before he leaned down and nuzzled his face into the crook of her neck. “I just want to know if you enjoyed it.”Adelaide began biting on her lower lip. The feeling of his nose brushing against her skin sent chills racing down her spine. The words she wanted to say seemed to have gotten stuck in her throat. And as Sirius began peppering her throat with soft, yet slightly sloppy, kisses, her entire body turned to liquid. She could feel her limbs turn to jelly, feeling like she had no control over the movement of her body.“Are you going to answer me?” Sirius questioned, his lips still brushing against her throat before he shifted to nudge her onto her back. He began kissing along her chest, glancing up through his lashes at her.“I don’t know what you want me to say.” Adelaide took in a deep breath, holding it in as she felt his hands move down her sides, following every curve of her body as he went.“My name.” he began, a chuckle erupting from deep within his chest as he shifted to kneel back, his hands grasping her thighs before pulling them apart so he could settle himself in between. “I want you to say my name.”Adelaide would be lying if she said she didn’t like the jealous side of Sirius. She had only seen this side of him about a handful of times, and all were because Charlie was involved. The back alley in Hogsmeade…the hug that lasted just a bit too long, and now the kiss beneath the mistletoe.“Sirius…”Adelaide let her hands reach up, grabbing onto his shoulders so she could pull him down against her. The feeling of his body pressed against hers was comforting. Her eyes fell shut and she let her hands roam down his sides and up his back, clutching onto him as if her life depended on it. Before long, their lips met tenderly. Whatever clothing that was left on between them was now being torn off, thrown recklessly off the bed.“Again.” Sirius demanded, almost pleading as he found himself sinking into her. His hands grasping her hips as his forehead pressed against hers. A low groan escaped his lips as he felt his hips make contact with hers, bottoming out inside of her. He knew sex was not the only time he felt this close to Adelaide – but right now in this very moment, Sirius had never felt as close to her before, physically, and emotionally.He knew his reason for initiating this intimate act was wrong – jealousy was an ugly thing. But here they were. And here they were going to stay. Atleast for a little while longer.“Sirius.” Adelaide let her hands grasp onto either side of his head, pulling him back so she could look up at him.“It’s you. It’s only you.” She whispered.A part of her knew she was reassuring not only him, but also reassuring herself. She gazed into his eyes, keeping focus as she felt him begin to move his hips back and forth. The warmth began to spread from between her legs, up through her abdomen and throughout the rest of her body. She pulled her knees back and linked her legs, at the ankle, around his waist, keeping him close.“I love you.” Sirius whispered roughly, his lips finding herself in a sloppy manner. His hands moved to either side of her head, fists tightly wound and pressing into the mattress to keep his upper body elevated above her.“I love you, too.”Adelaide let a soft moan escape her lips after professing her feelings to him. Her hands ran along every inch of his body she could reach, relishing in the feeling of the goosebumps she caused him along the way.Sirius felt himself growing warm, tingles starting from the tips of his toes and ending at the top of his head. His hips began speeding up, one hand moving to grasp her and hold her in place as his pace became unrelenting.Pressing his lips against hers roughly, Sirius let his tongue dart out for a little taste of her. She tasted like the bitter wine she had been drinking all night. And that was ok – he was sure he tasted just like the brandy he had drank, probably the entire bottle to be honest. He had lost count of how many he had after he realized that Charlie and Adelaide shared a kiss.Enchanted mistletoe or not, he was angry. A bit hurt, and maybe even confused. Sirius was never one to feel self-conscious. He didn’t want to know what it felt like to come in second place. Sirius was first. Always. And with Adelaide, he knew that was still the case.His jealousy would never ram its ugly head in between her friendship with Charlie. After all, Sirius felt comfortable knowing that if something were to happen to him, Adelaide would be taken care of. She would be protected and that helped him rest easier at night.“Are you close?” Adelaide whispered against his lips, parting her own to playfully nip at his lower lip before she began kissing down his jawline and back up to his earlobe. The way his hips continuously rocked into hers, she knew he had to be close to reaching his peak. His movements were becoming more and more frantic, his grasp on her hips tightening just enough that she would most likely see the results for days to follow.He didn’t respond verbally, though a quick nod was enough for Adelaide to understand him. Her arms tightened around him, her lips finding his once more. She could sense that there was something other than love behind his carnal need of the night. She wouldn’t dare ask him to elaborate. She wouldn’t dare tell him that she got little butterflies in her belly when Charlie pressed his lips against hers. No. She would definitely not tell him that.“I love you.” She repeated, making sure he heard her by grasping his cheeks and looked up at him with a soft smile. She needed him to know that he would never be second place to anyone else. She needed him to set aside his jealousy and ego when it came to Charlie. She knew it would be hard. After all, she had told him all about her unrequited love for him, how he left her, and everything else in between. But none of that mattered anymore. No, none of it mattered because she had Sirius. She would always have Sirius. She didn’t see her future without him.Closing her eyes at the feeling of Sirius applying more of his body weight against her, Adelaide let out a little noise as the warmth spread throughout her entire body again. Sirius was not far behind, moving one hand to her waist as he pressed his face into the crook of her neck, snapping his hips roughly until he found his release. A soft groan escaped his lips but came out muffled as his lips were smushed against the column of Adelaide’s throat, his nose happily inhaling her scent.He stayed on top of Adelaide after his hips stilled their movements, catching his breath before he pulled out from between her legs.“Stay.” She whispered, clutching onto him, keeping her legs open and wide so he could comfortably lay between them with his head against her chest.Sirius obliged, resting his cheek against her chest. His chest was rising and falling just as much, if not more, than hers. Working on regulating his breath, Sirius let his eyes flutter shut. He would be lying if he said he didn’t know what came over him. He didn’t want to talk about it now that things were said and done – he had just hoped that Adelaide would try not to pry or say anything about Charlie. Any kind of excuse or justification she would try to provide would only make him feel worse.Somehow Adelaide knew this. Deep, deep down she knew that they would never speak of this again. She knew that she would try to prove her love and devotion to Sirius as best she could. Idly playing with the curled strands of his hair, Adelaide began to feel herself drift off to sleep. A feeling of security washing over her at the feeling of Sirius’ body pressed against hers.Time had been passing them by too quickly. With the feeling of uneasiness about the future, Adelaide couldn’t help but wonder what the year 1996 would bring to them.After all, it was just around the corner.  

F E B R U A R Y 1996 “Harry is far from stupid, Sirius.” Adelaide swirled a spoonful of honey around in the steaming mug of tea sitting before her. “If Dumbledore thinks it’s good for Severus to teach him Occlumency, then there is probably nobody better for the job.”“When Snivellous is involved, there is always someone better for the job.”“Stop that.” Adelaide kicked Sirius’ shin beneath the table. “You have to start leaving the past in the past.”“Adelaide is right, you know.” Remus entered the sitting room, a large book in hand.Last week was the full moon. It had been a tough one, even with the fresh batch of wolfsbane courtesy of Adelaide. Remus had a fresh scar on the side of his neck. Wounds created by a werewolf changed under the light of the full moon were unable to be healed. Properly, atleast.Adelaide was able to scrounge together ingredients for a salve that would help minimize the redness and thickness of the scarring – to which Remus was extremely grateful.“Thank you, Remus. I’m glad someone sees me for what I truly am.” Adelaide smirked, setting down the spoon on her napkin once all of the honey melted off. Taking a sip and relishing in the warmth slipping down her throat, Adelaide looked up to see Sirius smirking right back.“And what are you, Ms. Corden?” Sirius questioned, raising a brow as he leaned back in the chair and watched her.“A bloody genius, that’s what.” She told him with a laugh.“I wouldn’t go that far.” Remus teased, laughter also escaping his lips as he poured himself a cup of tea before joining them at the table.With all that has been going on in the wizarding world, it was nice to have some sense of normalcy. Adelaide loved nothing more than sitting around the dining room table with Sirius and Remus, joking about silly things – sometimes serious things. If they couldn’t make light about serious things, what could they joke about?“Well…” Adelaide cleared her throat, “Poppy sent me a letter.”“Madam Pomfrey?” Sirius spoke up with a smile. “I didn’t know you kept in touch.”“How’s she doing?” Remus questioned. He was grateful for Madam Pomfrey also helping him out during his year of teaching at Hogwarts.“She’s doing well.” Adelaide nodded, “She’s told me a bit about Dolores Umbridge and how much of a bloody nightmare she is. I’m sure her letter mirrors the stories Ron and Harry told you over Christmas.” She sighed softly. Hogwarts sounded like a walking nightmare. Adelaide was thanking the gods, or whoever was up above, that she was no longer a student.“Umbridge sounds like a tightly wound bitch.” Sirius muttered beneath his breath, shuddering at the thought of what his godson and his friends were dealing with under her regime.“That’s because she is.” Adelaide sighed, “But the ministry backs her, which just absolutely boggles my mind.” The healer sipped the last of her tea before crossing her arms over her chest. “My father says that it’s getting bad now. His whole department seems to be fighting against one another on whether or not Harry is telling the truth about the dark lord returning.”Remus ran his fingers through his hair, brushing the strands from his forehead before he went to open the book he had brought in with him. “Well, it’s only going to get worse.”“Thanks Mr. Positive.” Adelaide rolled her eyes.“He’s not wrong.” Charlie entered the room now, a sloppily made jam-covered piece of toast hung from his lips as he tore a piece off and plopped down into a seat besides Adelaide.“You, Charles Weasley, you can hush.” Adelaide glared at him in a playful manner before she glanced over at Sirius. She stayed quiet but noticed the sudden change of his composure when Charlie entered the room and sat beside her.“The sooner you come to terms with this war, love, the better.” Sirius told her, his eyes focusing in on her for a moment before he glanced to Charlie and then Remus.“I don’t need to come to terms with anything, love.” Adelaide couldn’t help but feel frustrated with the way she was being treated. It was true, though - she was in denial about the worst being yet to come. Sirius and Remus had both been through the first wizarding war. And it resulted in the loss of their loved ones and not to mention Sirius’ wrongful imprisonment.“I understand that this war is coming. No, actually, that this war has already bloody started. But I still have a right to be terrified. Don’t you dare take that away from me, Sirius Black.” The blonde pushed herself up and made her way out of the room. She wasn’t sure what it was, but lately she had been going toe to toe with Sirius. There were moments where she felt like he was belittling her and her ability to handle what was to come. She hated that feeling.Adelaide didn’t dare look back over her shoulder as she stomped her way up the stairs. She just needed to cool down. It wasn’t just her emotions on high. The whole house was on edge, really.“I-“ Sirius huffed, glaring after Adelaide as she had stomped away before he looked over to Remus as if to ask for his opinion on what to do.“I’ll go talk to her.” Remus stated, closing his book with a sigh. He really wanted to finish this text, but it would have to wait.Charlie had stayed silent throughout the entire argument. He forgot how much of a spitfire Adelaide could be if she really wanted to be. As he sat there and listened to her stomp away and up the stairs, he couldn’t help but chuckle.“What’s so funny?” Sirius questioned.Hearing Sirius’ voice directed to him, Charlie glanced up and finished his piece of jam-covered toast with a shrug. He kept eye contact as he chewed, swallowing quickly before responding to Sirius’ inquiry. “Adelaide being Adelaide, that’s all.” ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► After storming off, Adelaide found herself in the music room. It had been a few months since she had last been in here and probably longer than that since she had physically played anything on the piano. Taking out her wand and whispering a quick cleaning spell, Adelaide sat down on the bench, stretching her fingers over the ivory keys with a soft sigh.“He means well, you know.”Turning at the intrusion, Adelaide narrowed her eyes at Remus as he stood in the doorway. “What? Did he send you after me so by the time he comes to apologize I won’t be as mad?”Remus chuckled. He wasn’t going to feed into the drama, even if what she was saying was exactly the type of thing Sirius would do.“I spoke up first. Said I’d come talk to you.” Remus admitted, setting his book down before walking over to the piano and taking a seat beside her on the bench. “Play me something?”Watching him, Adelaide chewed back on her bottom lip. She could see that he was still feeling worn out from his last transformation and made a mental note to make him a few vials of a muscle relaxant potion.She turned to face the keys and without even thinking twice about what to play, her fingers making the decision for her as she started Moonlight Sonata. Beethoven had always been one of her favorites. The hardest to master, according to her father, so that just made her practice more and more.Remus sat silently as she played. His eyes falling onto the keys before them as her fingers pressed lightly, yet meaningfully, against the ivory. It was strange, but he had always said music had some sort of healing component and right now was no different. He could feel his muscles relax as his breath evened out.“That’s beautiful, Addy.” He told her, a smile forming on his lips as he looked up to her face now once she stopped playing.“Thank you. Music was always my escape.” She admitted sheepishly.“Do you want to talk about it?”With a sigh, Adelaide turned a bit to get a better look at Remus. “If I say no, will you drop it?”“Probably not. I care too much.” Remus chuckled.“You’re quite persuasive when you want to be, Remus.” Adelaide stood up from the piano and moved to now sit down in the little reading nook by the window. The windows had all been charmed to be one-way – almost like a mirror from the outside. She could look out and watch what was going on outside, what was happening in the real world, but nobody would ever see her.“Sometimes I feel like Sirius treats me like I’m a child. And it makes me uncomfortable. Considering we’re in a romantic relationship with one another.” Adelaide shrugged, starting to absently pick at the fraying material of her sweater. “I don’t like being told that I’m not going to be able to handle something, or that I’m not thinking things clearly. After all, I’m a bloody Ravenclaw for Merlin’s sake!” the blonde couldn’t help but laugh.Remus smiled. “Yes, yes, we get it. You’re smart.” He teased, turning to move one leg over the side of the bench, watching her nervous ticks start to take over. “But, in all honesty Adelaide, he does these things because he loves you. And I think a part of him is scared.”“Remus, I know he loves me.” Adelaide huffed, pulling out the chain that was hidden beneath her sweater, showing off the Black family ring that hung around her neck. “But belittling me, especially infront of everyone, doesn’t show that. If anything, it shows some sort of distrust. Sometimes I think he wants to push me away and I hate it. I feel so lost.”Remus sighed. He knew exactly what she was talking about. Although he did not have someone he cared about in the same way that he did with Adelaide, all those years ago before the death of James and Lily Sirius acted out. He was always short-tempered with his friends. They had gotten into their share of arguments… the lies… Remus was just hoping that the distrust would not occur again.“Have you spoken to him about how you feel?” he questioned, his brow raised as he watched and waited for an answer.With a shake of her head, Adelaide looked away from the window to face Remus. “No. I never get a chance to.” Which was not a lie. “Anytime I try to discuss something serious with him… well, he does things to distract me.” Clearly her throat, Adelaide rubbed at the back of her neck for a moment before she tucked the ring back down beneath her collar.Blushing at her insinuation, Remus let out a forced laugh. “Ah, well… Yes. That’s Sirius for you, really.” He shrugged, “He uses physical contact for relief, always has.”“Great pep talk, Remus. I feel so much better.”In all honesty, Adelaide knew that was like some type of defense mechanism for Sirius. There had only been a handful of times where after sharing his bed did she feel used. All their serious discussions turned into sex. All their arguments turned into sex. She was beginning to understand that it was an unhealthy habit that they needed to break.“You need to talk to him.” Remus repeated himself. “Make him understand somehow, I’m sure you can do it.” He joked, a small smirk appearing on his lips as he looked over at her.Adelaide was smirking back. “What would I do without you?” With a sigh, she tucked strands of hair behind her ears before standing up from the reading nook.“Probably go mental.” Remus joked in response. “Though I think eventually you would manage it all.”“Well, I’m glad I don’t have to think about that.” Adelaide walked up to him and as he stood to meet her halfway, she wrapped her arms around his waist in a tight embrace. “Thank you, Remus. I mean it. I really don’t know what I’d do without you.” She admitted softly.Just then a knock on the door broke the two apart. Glancing over to the doorway, Adelaide forced a smile at Sirius standing there. He looked like a dog who was standing with its tail between his legs. Rightfully so, of course.“Mind if I cut in?”Remus cleared his throat as he looked to Adelaide as if asking her feelings on being left alone with Sirius. She nodded and pressed a quick kiss to Remus’ cheek as farewell, “Thank you again.”Remus nodded, “Anytime.” He pecked her cheek back before walking out of the room, picking up his book on the way. A silent nod to Sirius as he passed him in the doorway before giving them their privacy.“I guess I should apologize for my-uh, for the way I’ve been acting.” Sirius began, stepping completely through the threshold and closing the door behind him so that their conversation would not be heard by the rest of the house.“You guess?” Adelaide sat back by the piano now. She was trying her hardest to tamp down the anger boiling in her chest. She hated fighting with Sirius. She hated fighting in general. Life was too short for communication issues to be the reason for a failing relationship.“No, I don’t guess. I mean that I’m sorry. I am. Truly, I am.” Sirius stood behind her and started playing with the ends of her hair, focusing on what he was doing and not looking elsewhere. “I love you, Addy. You know that I do. Sometimes I have a hard time showing it appropriately.”“Sirius, I love you too. You know that I do. But sometimes I feel like we’re going nowhere.” Adelaide admitted, turning to glance over her shoulder and up at him. She hated this feeling. Lately, atleast in the past two months, it felt like there was a thick, dark cloud hanging over her head all the time.“What do you mean going nowhere?” Sirius scoffed, removing his hands from her hair as he sat down beside her. “I’ve already stated my intentions for you. Clear as day.” He told her, reaching over to slip his fingers beneath the collar of her sweater and pluck out the chain holding his family ring.“Sometimes I feel like you don’t have faith in me and that you don’t trust me.” Adelaide whispered sadly. Her hands were resting in her lap before she started picking at the frayed edges of her sweater again. “And I have done nothing but be honest with you. I’ve given up a lot for you.”“Given up?” Sirius narrowed his eyes as he watched her pick at her sweater aimlessly. “I’ve not asked you to give up anything for me. Not once. And I know life right now with me is not what it should be, but my name will be cleared one day. Hopefully soon…and then things will change. They will get better, Adelaide. I promise you.”“That’s the problem, though.” She sighed, “You can’t promise that. You can’t promise anything. And neither can I. Everything could change tomorrow, a week from now, a year from now.”“You’re scared and that’s understandable.” Sirius reached for her and was relieved that she did not pull away. His arms tightened around her shoulders as he pulled her back against his chest. “I’m scared, too. But we can be scared together.” He offered, a laugh escaping from behind his lips as she turned to look at him.“Somehow that doesn’t make me feel that much better… but I can see you’re trying.” She laughed. She sucked her bottom lip in as her head rested back against his shoulder.Things were never going to be perfect. But a girl could dream… Right?

J U N E 1996, G R I M M A U L D P L A C EAfter their fight back in February, things had started to get better with Adelaide and Sirius. Although they had a few squabbles here and there, overall things were good. Sirius was warming up to Charlie, and that melted Adelaide’s heart.Adelaide did not mention the kiss to Charlie, to Sirius, or to anyone else. Charlie kept his mouth shut as well. Though there were still glances across an empty room or hallway – but they still didn’t speak of it.“Do you think we could talk Albus into letting Harry stay here with us?” Adelaide kept her eyes on the cauldron before her. White smoke perforated the edges, billowing over just enough to reach the countertop before dissipating in thin air.“Love, I wish I knew the answer to that.” Sirius found himself letting out a heavy sigh. He wished he knew the answer to her question. After all, deep down he knew he would go to the ends of the earth to have his godson living with him.“Well, maybe I can talk to him. Knowing you, you’ll get all riled up and that won’t do Harry any good.” A small smirk appeared on her lips as she glanced quickly over to Sirius as he went over a large potions textbook she had open on the work bench to her left.“I get riled up, sure, but it is for a good cause.” Sirius laughed, knowing that wasn’t really a good excuse but he was thirty-six years-old man living on the run (technically in hiding), so he really had to pick and chose his battles. Fighting with the headmaster of Hogwarts would definitely not be a good thing to do, especially for someone like Sirius Black.Adelaide didn’t respond. Instead, she found herself submerged in focusing on the potion before her. Every free moment she had from work, or other obligations, Adelaide did what she could to brush up on her potion making skills. Remus had wanted to train her with a few defense spells, but Sirius didn’t want her fighting – whenever it came time to do so.She had a stockpile of different potions to reserves certain jinxes and spells, salves for burns and wounds. Maybe she was being too neurotic about it all, but she couldn’t just sit around and do nothing. Hearing Remus, Sirius, Molly and Arthur talk about the first wizarding war frightened her. She wasn’t sure if she was prepared to fight – to kill someone in order to save herself, or even a loved one. Was anyone really prepared to make those kind of decisions? Adelaide still wasn’t sure of the answer to that question. She was beginning to think she may never be ready.Once the potion stopped creating the white fog, Adelaide turned around to check out the shelves behind her. Once she found what she was looking for, she spun back around to add it to the cauldron.Sirius, being as nosy as ever, peered over her shoulder to get a peak at what she had grabbed. “Billywig stings?” he questioned.“Yes,” Adelaide looked down at the slime, crinkling her noise at the texture. Though she had dealt with far worse, anything that was slimy in texture always freaked her out. She added it into the cauldron, happy with herself when a small cloud of purple shot up, disappearing just as quick as it appeared. “I’m making some Wiggenweld Potion.” Adelaide, without grabbing her wand, whispered beneath her breath as the medium-sized, empty vials on the countertop began filling up with the liquid. “It’s an easy potion. Severus taught us in first year. But it’s extremely power and potent.”Sirius had always found it fascinating when Adelaide went off on potion tangents. She was exceptionally adorable when her nose crinkled, or when her wand was holding up her hair in a bun at the back of her head. Though he found himself preferring her hair down – and messy from their obvious bouts of lovemaking – he thought she looked rather studious with her hair back the way it was now.“I see you’ve been working on your wandless magic, too.” Sirius grinned. He stepped over and slipped his hands along her waist from behind, “Did I ever tell you that powerful witches are a major turn on for me, dear?”Laughing at Sirius’ brazen behavior, Adelaide nudged him back with her elbow. “Yes. You’ve told me numerous times, on many different occasions.”Sirius smirked. He moved his hands over his heart, acting as though she had hurt him. “Ouch, love. You wound me.” He teased, leaning forward to kiss her cheek softly before he pulled back at the sound of incoming footsteps. They were loud and fast.“Who the bloody hell is running these halls?” ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► J U N E 1996, H O G W A R T SStanding as tall as possible – which was hard because the woman was quite short, Dolores Umbridge narrowed her dark and beady eyes at Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived was now sitting slouched back in the chair feeling at a major loss.His heart felt like it was beating out of his chest. Whatever this connection to Voldemort was…is… it was freaking him out. He could barely get through finishing his O.W.Ls when his mind was twisted with a vision of his beloved Godfather, Sirius Black, being tortured at the hands of the Dark Lord. Harry had to do something!“Ah, yes, Professor Snape.” Dolores was smirking now. And the look on her face could rival any evil dictator that the muggle world had ever seen. Atleast that was what Hermione Granger was thinking to herself as she stood there, helpless against Umbridge’s cherished Inquisitorial Squad. Bloody Malfoy.Severus stood in the doorway, his eyes narrowing in on Harry, Ron, and Hermione before quickly scanning the rest of the faces in the room, ending on Dolores. “Yes, Headmaster?” Having to call this putrid woman Headmaster made the potions professor literally quite ill. Though he was rather good at saving face. She had no idea how much he loathed her and her presence in Hogwarts.“Mr. Potter has been in communication with one Albus Dumbledore. But,” She turned back to stare down Harry once more. “He is refusing to cooperate. And that is just something that I cannot have. I need you to bring me the Veritaserum at once.”Severus was taken back, but only slightly. He turned to look at Dolores after he made brief eye contact with Harry.“Well, you see, there’s a problem. There is no more Veritaserum.” Snape stated monotonously.Everyone in the room could see how red Dolores’ face was turning. “What? That’s impossible!” she snapped angrily. She really did not like when things didn’t go her way.Severus shook his head, “I have no more samples left. And it would take too long to brew correctly.” He wasn’t lying, though a part of him was enjoying the way she was getting flustered at a change of plans needing to take place.As Severus was about to take his leave, Harry shifted in his seat. “Snape! Please, you must listen to me. Listen to me!” He cried. Severus could tell by the look on his face that the boy was absolutely distraught. He was about to continue on his way but one glimpse into the green eyes that reminded him so much of Harry’s mother and he halted any further movement from the doorway.“Snape!” Harry cried out once more. “He’s got Padfoot at the place where it’s hidden.” ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► J U N E 1996, G R I M M A U L D P L A C E“Sniv-““Severus!” Adelaide quickly cut off Sirius as she heard him begin to use the nickname they had given him during their school days.The healer walked quickly to the doorway, examining the potion professor closely. His skin was more pale than usual, and his forehead had a small bit of sweat accumulating by his hairline. “What is it? What are you doing here?”Sirius stayed silent, watching the interaction from his position at the workbench.“It’s Harry.” Severus spoke quickly, glancing from Adelaide back over to Sirius.Instantly, Sirius straightened his back and rushed over to the doorway. “What about Harry? Is he ok? Is he hurt?”Severus shook his head. “Umbridge caught him and his little friends. Asked me for a sample of Veritaserum, which she had been using on other students to find out the happenings within Hogwarts. She believes he was trying to use the floo to contact Albus, but I think he was trying to contact you.”Adelaide sucked in a deep breath. She looked at Sirius and reached out, grasping his arm to help stabilize him and bring him back down. She could see the gears turning, figuratively of course. She knew all of his tells and knew when he was starting to panic.“Contact Sirius? For what reason?” Adelaide spoke up.“Before I left the room, Harry said that ‘he has Padfoot in the place where it’s hidden’.” Severus crossed his arms over his chest, glancing at Sirius knowingly. The nickname was not a secret. Harry knew Severus would know exactly who he was talking about.“The place where it’s hidden…” Sirius repeated. He began to pace back and forth as he tried to think of what was going on. This was not the kind of excitement he was hoping for tonight.“The Ministry.” Adelaide spoke up, already whipping out her and from behind her head to conjure up her patronus to send to the rest of The Order.“We’ve talked about Harry’s link to the Dark Lord.” She continued, chewing back on her bottom lip. She watched Sirius stop his pacing, staring at her now as he stood beside Severus. She never thought she’d see them standing so close together without being down each other’s throat. “Maybe he had another vision of sorts? I mean, Padfoot…” She gestured to Sirius, “And the place where it’s hidden. The prophecy.”Severus held his composure. Adelaide was smart, much more than he had ever given her credit for during her time as his student. She always thought quick on her feet, she was a brilliant witch. He found himself, through all of this chaos, wondering what she was doing with the likes of one Sirius Orion Black.“The Department of Mysteries, that’s where they’re headed. Vold-“ Adelaide cut herself off before speaking the Dark Lord’s name. “The Dark Lord, I mean, must have manipulated the vision in his head. Harry must believe that he’s got Sirius there.”Severus nodded. “We must warn the rest of The Order.”Sirius hated to say it, but he agreed. “Addy?”Adelaide nodded, waving her hand at Sirius. “Already ahead of you.” She turned her back to the men before conjuring her patronus, a small and adorable river otter. Another thing she had in common with one Hermione Granger. She sent the urgent message to the rest of the order which only included Tonks, Remus, Kingsley, and Moody.Once she was done, she had turned back around to watch Severus start to walk away, “I have to get back to Hogwarts before Umbridge notices that I’ve gone.” He explained. His black robes billowing behind him as he rushed back down the hallway towards the staircase. “Good luck.” He glanced back over his shoulder at Sirius and Adelaide as they both began following him. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► J U N E 1996, H O G W A R T S“I can’t let you come with me. I have to fight my own battles!” Harry exclaimed, his hands thrown up in the air as he stood on the bridge, eyes blown full wide. He refused to let anyone else get hurt because of him. Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to live with himself if any of his friends, the courageous ones standing before him especially, were to get hurt – or worse.“Harry, please.” Hermione pleaded with him.“You’re bloody insane if you think we’re going to let you go alone.” Ron snapped, his finger pointing in Harry’s face. The youngest Weasley male was agitated that Harry was refusing help. He didn’t understand why his best friend acted this way because if he were in his shoes, he would have wanted for his friends to rally around him like they were doing so now.It took a bit of back and forth but Harry finally succumbed to his friends and their persistent pushing about joining him at The Ministry. They only had one problem.“I’m not sure how we’re going to get there from here, though.” Harry sighed, rubbing at the back of his neck for a moment before he made eye contact with Ginny through the group. Her soft green eyes sparkled just a bit as she gave him a nod. This must have been how his father felt anytime his mother looked at him. It damn near made him weak in the knees but he had something more serious to think about now.Luna giggled softly, causing everyone to turn and look at her.“We fly, of course.” ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►►

J U N E 1996, G R I M M A U L D P L A C E”You’re not coming and that is final.”Adelaide glared up at Sirius. Her arms were tightly crossed over her chest and if you looked close enough, steam may as well have been billowing out of her ears.“You are not my father, Sirius Black. You do not control me!” the healer cried, her eyes still narrowed on him as the rest of The Order continued to gather around in the sitting room.“Addy, darling,” Molly stepped up and placed a hand on her shoulder. “Sirius is right. You shouldn’t go. We need you back here.”“Back here? Doing what? Just twirling my hair and waiting? You know I can’t do that Molly.” Adelaide whispered, a look of defeat washing over her as she turned to face the rest of the room now.Tonks was standing beside Remus and after turning away from him in their own private conversation, she walked over to her best friend. “Addy, I know that you are more than capable of coming with us. But Molly is right… And well, I hate saying this,” She grimaced, turning to look at Sirius before a smirk appeared on her lips. “Sirius is right, too.”Leave it to Nymphadora Tonks to try and lighten the mood. Unfortunately, it wasn’t helping Adelaide feel much better.“Tonks.” Adelaide glared at her best friend for a moment before she looked at Remus. “Remus, what about you? What do you think? Can’t we take like a bloody fucking vote or something?”Charlie stepped up, grasping Adelaide’s elbow to pull her closer to his side. “They’re right, Addy. Think about it. You are probably the most brilliant healer that any of us have ever known. We cannot risk you getting hurt. We honestly have no idea what we’re walking into.”“Charlie is right.” Sirius spoke up, ignoring the sinking feeling in his gut as he watched Adelaide relax into Charlie’s grasp. “You need to be here. It’s possible that we’ll need you to work your healing magic, love. We have no idea what we’re walking into with this.”Charlie let go and stepped back as Sirius walked up to cup Adelaide’s cheeks, bringing her in for a quick, rough kiss. “I could never forgive myself if something happened to you.” He whispered against her lips, pulling back to look down at her. “Please understand that.”Adelaide sighed against his lips. She kissed him back, even though she was still angry at being left behind. “Please be careful. All of you.” She stepped back and reached for Tonks’ hand, clasping it tightly. “I mean it. I don’t want to have to heal you. Any of you. If you think I’m angry now… just wait until you have me as your healer.”Charlie laughed, shaking his head. He knew Adelaide would put up a fight. He knew that she would want to be with them all – Sirius, especially. But the truth of it all was that they really had no idea what to expect. Severus only stated what Harry had told him and Adelaide took it from there.Since the breakout of Death Eaters back in January, the wizarding world was certainly on edge. Adelaide hadn’t noticed a spike in trauma events in St. Mungos since then, but she chalked that up to them laying low. The only patient that stood out was Broderick Bode. Broderick was an Unspeakable and had been admitted to St. Mungos with confusion. That wasn’t out of the ordinary. A lot of different things could have played a role in his admission to the hospital but what happened afterwards – that was what stood out. Broderick was strangled to death in his hospital bed by some Devil’s Snare. This had happened prior to Arthur’s attack. The Dark Lord has to have someone on in the inside, Adelaide thought.Adelaide had been the one to find him. She thought taking a career as a healer would keep her on her toes. She thought that there wouldn’t be any type of malady that would make her stomach turn. She was wrong.There was no turning back now. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► J U N E 1996, T H E M I N I S T R Y O F M A G I C“It’s rather creepy here at night. Don’t you think?” Neville found himself asking the group this question, turning around in circles as he took in their surroundings.Luna shrugged in response, twirling around so she could take in her surroundings as well.The group, which included Harry, Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood, found themselves descending to Level 9, walking through a dark and empty hallway ultimately leading them to the Department of Mysteries.Before the group stood twelve identical black doors.“These doors… where are the handles?” Ginny questioned, taking a step forward to investigate before Harry reached forward and pulled her back.“We don’t know what we’re dealing with down here, Gin.” He hissed to her, not wanting to sound mean but his nerves were alight. He had to find Sirius before it was too late.Together, the six of them came up with a plan and began going through the doorways unsure of where it would lead them. Subconsciously, Harry kept close to Ginny as they went, his free hand never straying too far from hers.“These lights. I know them.” Harry looked around for a moment before closing his eyes as he began to think of which part of his dream he had seen them in.“We’re in the Time Chamber.” Hermione spoke up, inspecting a few things that were strewn around the walls and shelves before they all took another door which led them to another dark, empty room.The Hall of Prophecies.

J U N E 1996, G R I M M A U L D P L A C E“Please be careful.” Adelaide pleaded, her hands grasping the front of Sirius’ jacket, holding him close to her as she stared up at him with wide, tear-filled eyes.Tonks, Remus, and Moody had already taken the floo to the ministry from the fireplace that rested in the corner of the sitting room. Molly and Arthur were saying goodbye to Charlie – Molly, being the mother that she was, was fussing tremendously over her son, worried for his safety. If she had her way, Charlie would be staying here with them.Kingsley was next to leave, nodding to everyone in the room before disappearing through the flames.“I love you, Adelaide Corden.” Sirius whispered, his thumb brushing over her cheekbone for a moment before he leaned down and kissed her softly.“Come back to me, Sirius Black. Promise me.” She pleaded in a whisper.Sirius could only smile in response. He kissed her forehead and stepped back to let her say goodbye to Charlie.“Watch his back, Charlie. For me. Please?” the blonde whispered to her best friend, wrapping her arms around his neck to pull him down and squeeze him in a hug.“You’ve got it, boss.” Charlie told her, a small smile appearing on his lips as he looked down at her. “Don’t miss us too much. We’ll be back before you know it.” He teased, nodding to Sirius as they both stepped closer to the fireplace.Adelaide sighed. She tried her best to find the humor in Charlie’s words, but it was hard.As the two stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the fireplace, Sirius glanced up at Charlie. A slight scowl at the fact that the younger male stood so tall, towering over him. Once he listened to Adelaide’s footsteps leaving the room – most likely going back to her laboratory to occupy herself – he began to speak.“Promise me that if something happens to me tonight, Charlie,” Sirius cleared her throat, grabbing a handful of floo powder. “That you’ll take care of her. As much as I dislike you and your relationship with her,” he couldn’t help but laugh. “I know that she loves you. And that you love her. So, I need to be sure that she will be taken care of. That she will be protected.”Charlie froze at the mention of Adelaide loving him. He knew better than to think that she was still in love with him. “You have my word, Sirius. She’s my best friend. I would go to the ends of this earth to make sure she was safe.”Sirius nodded firmly.“Shall we?” ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► J U N E 1996, H A L L O F P R O P H E C I E SAs the group of six teenagers began looking around, Harry felt drawn to a nearby corner. His eyes felt onto a brightly lit orb, his name written out down below. Reaching out, Harry slipped his fingertips against the orb, clutching it tight in the palm of his hand as he lifted it from its spot on the shelf before him.“I really don’t think you should do that, Harry!” Hermione hissed, shaking her head in disapproval.In a matter of seconds, clouds of dark matter erupted around the group of teenagers. Clutching onto one another, everyone stumbled closer forming a circle.“Well, well, well…”Surrounding the teenagers was a group of Death Eaters. Harry clutched the prophecy in his hand as if his life depended on it. And well, really it kind of did. Wands clutched tight and raised high, the group stood as tall as they could when they found themselves surrounded by the large group of Death Eaters.“Hand over the prophecy.” Lucius Malfoy commanded, his pale hand resting on the top of his cane.Harry continued to keep a tight grip on the prophecy orb in his hand. “What? This prophecy?” he lifted his hand up, turning the orb around as he watched the light swirl inside, his eyes falling back onto Lucius before glancing to Bellatrix, who was creeping up behind him. Sirius was right – that woman really was twisted.“Don’t you want to know the secret?” Lucius smirked. The Death Eaters took one more step closer to the group of teenagers. “The secret to your scar, Mr. Potter. I can show you…everything. Don’t you want to know? Don’t you want to see?”The teenagers turned at the sound of footsteps closing in on them. The other Death Eaters were wearing masks, hiding their ugly faces from being seen. Bellatrix, though, she was different. She had no problem showing her face. The woman most likely craved the attention. If she was going to do some damage here tonight, she would want the world to know that it was her. But Lucius. It was surprising that the father of their classmate, Draco Malfoy, would not want to hide his face.“I’ve waited fourteen years.” Harry finally spoke up, a small smirk appearing on his lips.Lucius grinned. The poor man really thought he was getting somewhere with The Boy Who Lived.“I can wait a little bit longer.” Harry said.His gaze shifted side to side, stepping back a bit closer to his friends. Neville stood behind him, the tallest of the group gave him a nod.“Now!” Harry cried.Six wands were raised, and six voices rung out, “Stupefy!”Unfortunately, not a single Death Eater was hit. Disappearing in clouds of black smoke gave the teenagers the ability to run.And run they did.They kept close to one another, and though Harry was clutching the prophecy in one hand and his wand in the other, he made sure to brush the back of one hand against Ginny’s, silently checking to make sure she knew that he was there next to her.Before dodging Lucius again, rushing down another aisle of prophecies the group ended up splitting up. Harry rushed down one aisle, Luna, Ginny, and Neville another, leaving Hermione and Ron together down another aisle.“Stupefy!”“Petrificus Totalus!”“Stupefy!”With all their running, spells shooting every which way down every aisle, knocking prophecy orbs down, they rejoined and clutched onto one another.“Everyone ok?”Everyone shook their heads. Nobody was hurt, luckily, but the ominous black clouds began swirling again. Before any of them could react, Ginny stepped forward with her wand raised high, “Reducto!”Panting, Ginny stepped back, her back coming into contact with Harry’s chest as the orbs on the highest shelves began crashing down. The noise of the shattering glass echoed around them.Luna, being… well, being Luna, stepped forward. Her head tilted back, and she was watching the chaos before them with a wonderous twinkle in her eyes.“Luna!” Neville whispered, rushing forward, and grabbing her hand in his. He began tugging her back as Harry shouted for them to get back to the door.As they began running, the shelves surrounding them were crashing down. With each step forward, they missed being taken out by either a prophecy or by a shelf that held the prophecy. Those same steps brought them closer and closer to the door.Pushing it open and rushing in, the group of teenagers stumbled into the air and fell to the ground below them. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► J U N E 1996, G R I M M A U L D P L A C E“I don’t know what to do with myself.”Adelaide had been pacing back and forth for over twenty minutes, most likely wearing down the old wooden floors.“Dear, I know this is hard. Trust me.” Molly spoke in that motherly tone she was known for, looking up from her teacup as she tapped the sides of it with her spoon.“During the first war,” the matriarch began again, “I was always home with the kids, but I attended every single meeting with The Order. It was tough at first, because all I wanted to do was help. I wanted to make a change in the scary world we were forced to live in.” Molly took a sip of her tea, a soft sigh escaping her lips for a moment before she gestured for Adelaide to take a seat.“Please sit down before you wear a hole right in the floor. I can already hear the portrait of Walburga screaming at the top of her lungs about ruining her beautiful wood floors.” Molly teased, trying her best to bring a smile to the young girl’s face.Adelaide sat down, slouching forward in the chair, and resting her head in her hands. “How did you manage it? The unknown?”“Well, for me… I had the boys to look after. I knew that what the order was doing was going to make the world a better place for them to continue growing up in.”Adelaide smiled weakly. “I don’t have children to look after to occupy my time.”“You have your lab.” Molly offered, finishing her tea before setting the cup down slowly before flicking her wand and sending the dirty dishes to the sink to be cleaned. “I know it’s easier said than done, sweetheart, believe me I do.” Molly reached over and slipped her hand onto Adelaide’s, giving it a firm squeeze.Adelaide smiled warmly as Molly began to mother her. Even though she had her own mother, who was still alive and well, Molly’s presence was always so important to Adelaide. She understood why her own parents wanted to remain hidden from the fighting – lurking in the shadows of the order and the meetings. It was a scary time. The unknown of whether or not your friend is going to come home after a run in with some Death Eaters.She found herself worrying about Charlie. About Sirius, and Remus, and Tonks. She knew that they were all strong and more than capable of handling a skirmish with dark magic involved but it was still hard to accept the fact that she could not be there with them.“I guess I’ll go make myself useful.” Adelaide joked, giving Molly’s hand a squeeze in return before she stood up and walked out of the room.Once she got to her lab, she started going over the inventory of potions and salves she had already brewed and created. But the more she tried to busy herself with the monotony of checking and rechecking the lab, she realized something.She had to go. ◄◄◄◄◄×►►►►► J U N E 1996, D E P A R T M E N T O F M Y S T E R I E S“We’ll split into pairs and search, and don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve gotten the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary…” Lucius ordered the rest of the Death Easters as they broke apart to chase after Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna.Running. So much running. Harry didn’t think his legs could take any more. Death Eater after Death Eater chasing them down. Attempted killing curses, hexes and jinxes being shot wall to wall, ceiling to floor.They were followed through the Time, Brain, and Space chambers. It was hard for the teens to stop and get a chance to study the cool things around them.“Stupefy!” Hermione screamed loudly.“Bloody hell!” Neville’s mouth was hanging so wide that his chin may as well have been hitting the floor.Hermione had hit Rabastan Lestrange square in the chest which ultimately knocked the Death Eater over into a bell jar.“H-He’s got a… I mean, he’s a baby…” Neville was completely perplexed at seeing the older man’s head shrink down and turn into that of a baby before it turned back to an adult, and then into a baby again. It was like the transformation continued to take place, over and over again, and Neville couldn’t help but find it a bit amusing.After a while they found themselves back in the Death chamber.“Cruciatus!” Bellatrix’s cackle was so loud that Harry found himself cringing before shouting at her to leave Neville alone. He felt defeated. Completely, and utterly defeated. It was a terrible feeling.In the blink of an eye, high above them, two more doors burst open and there were now five more people entering the fight. Harry broke out into a grin as he spotted Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, Charlie, and Kingsley.He had been so distracted at his attempt to escape alongside Neville that Harry did not notice Walden Macnair sneak up behind him. Macnair grabbed Harry and yanked him back roughly. Neville’s arm shot forward, shoving the tip of Hermione’s wand (which he had taken after his got broken) into the eye hole of the mask, causing the Death Eater to instantly release his grasp on Harry.The odds were against Harry and Neville. At another chance that they thought they had, the duo attempted escape once more.“Take this!” Harry whispered, handing Neville the prophecy before shooting an Impediment Jinx at Lucius. Harry was strong. The jinx sent Lucius back but did not disable him for long.Remus found himself jumping before Harry and Neville, urging them to get out along with the others. With this next escape route, Neville shifted just a bit too roughly as he tried to regain his footing. The prophecy slipped from his pocket and crashed down to the ground, breaking into a multitude of tiny little pieces.Before they even had time to process what had just occurred, the door burst open and Albus Dumbledore stepped through and instantly submerged himself in the middle of battle.“Bloody hell. The man always knew how to make an entrance.” Charlie couldn’t help but chuckle in between shooting hexes at the duo of Death Eaters before him. Tonks, standing beside him, chuckled as well.“Where the bloody hell are they going now? Scared of an old man, are ya?” Tonks shot another hex, stepping closer and closer to the middle of the room.Charlie noticed as well that the remainder of Death Eaters were trying to flee, assuming that Tonks was right, and it was because of Dumbledore’s arrival.He heard a woosh behind him, spinning around with his wand held high. He wouldn’t be dumb enough to let a Death Eater get the better of him.“Adelaide?” He couldn’t believe his eyes. “Addy? What the bloody hell are you doing here?” He shouted at her.“Is that the best you’ve got, Bella?” Sirius’ voice echoed loudly in the air around them. Even being locked away from twelve years, and being in hiding for the last two, Sirius still had it. Dueling with his estranged cousin, Bellatrix was like nothing for him. He had not even seen Dumbledore make his grand entrance.The one thing he did notice, and unfortunately so, was the name of the woman he loved being said loudly. Why was Charlie calling out to Adelaide when she was home?Taking his eyes from Bellatrix, though keeping his wand raised high, his gaze fell onto the tall redhead who was now grabbing hold of the familiar small blonde.That was all it took. One distraction. One moment. With one blink of an eye a life could be taken.And it was. 

J U N E 1996, D E P A R T M E N T O F M Y S T E R I E SOne moment. That was all it took. Sirius took his eyes off the fight before him to search out Adelaide once he heard Charlie calling her name. Because of his actions, Bellatrix was able to shoot a spell directly to his chest. The force was strong enough to knock him back but not harm him.Unfortunately, he did not take into consideration the veil being behind him. He slipped backwards, beginning to feel the effects of entering the veil as a living, breathing thing. His eyes became wide, but he did not look scared. Before drifting up and away, he locked eyes with the woman of his dreams across the way. He so desperately wanted to reach out and tell her it would be ok – but as his hands reached forward, he entered the veil completely.One moment. One moment, and Sirius black was no longer in the land of the living.“NO!” Adelaide’s voice rang out, echoing against the walls around her. “Sirius!”Tears were streaming down her cheeks as she began rushing forward, grabbing her wand to point at Bellatrix. One the other side of the room, Remus was clutching Harry tight to his chest. Harry was crying. He was screaming. Just like Adelaide was.Charlie was able to catch up with Adelaide, wrapping his arms around her shoulders and pulling her back. He stayed silent, knowing no words were not going to change how Adelaide was feeling right now. He could feel her body shaking in his arms, and her tears leaking from her eyes were streaming so fast down her cheeks that they were now dripping onto his forearms.Adelaide didn’t know what to focus on. She watched Bellatrix, that murderous bitch, slink away in the shadows with a large smirk on her face. “I’m going to kill her.” Adelaide cried, the sobs beginning to rack her entire body as she shook in Charlie’s arms.Remus and Charlie made eye contact and with silent nods started walking closer to one another.“SHE KILLED SIRIUS! SHE KILLED HIM – I’LL KILL HER!” Harry was still screaming, fighting against Remus’ protective grasp. As Remus began dragging him back, further and further away from the veil, he looked to Charlie.“We have to get them both out of here.”Charlie nodded, “They’re both hysterical. There’s no way of them not getting splinched if I try to disapparate them back to Grimmauld Place.”Both Charlie and Remus made the mistake of loosening their grip on the two heartbroken souls. One moment is all it took. One moment and both Harry and Adelaide – side by side – began rushing after Bellatrix.“Addy, no!” Charlie yelled after her, instantly feeling his heart drop into his stomach as he tried to rush after her. Remus held an arm out, “Wait.” He told him, a heavy sigh escaping his lips. “Don’t go chasing after them… Not yet.”Adelaide was shocked she was able to run with Harry – she could barely see through the tears.“Harry!” Adelaide whispered, wiping her cheeks to rid herself of the hot tears before she reached forward and grabbed onto his hand. “Harry, let’s think about this. Please.” She was finding it hard to catch her breath. The image of Sirius being lifted up and away in the veil was seared, forever, in the forefront of her mind. The last remaining twinkle in his eye as she stared back at him, arms outstretched, tears running wild down her cheeks.“What’s there to think away?” Harry cried as his own cheeks became covered in wet, hot tears. “I’m going to kill Bellatrix. She killed him! Addy, please, do not try to stop me.”“I-I’m not going to stop you. I want her to suffer. She needs to suffer for what she’s done to Sirius… to us. We need to come up with a pl-“Adelaide was cut off by the loud cackling echo surrounding them. The grip on her wand tightened and she shifted to stand in front of Harry. She did her best to look around, controlling her breathing so if they needed to hide, they would be as quiet as possible.“Come out, come out, little Harry!” Bellatrix cooed, a cackling escaping her dry, cracked lips. “What did you come after me for then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!”Adelaide and Harry both rushed forward, trying to get closer to the source. Before they knew it, they were walking out into the Ministry’s main atrium.“I AM!” Harry yelled back with anger apparent in his voice. His hand was shaking, though his grip was tight on his wand.Adelaide stood beside Harry, her eyes darting around as she got accustomed to their surroundings. She spotted Bellatrix, raising her hand and quickly shot a hex in her direction, attempting to knock her back and off her feet.“Oh, deary.” Bellatrix cackled, her eyes moving back and forth quickly between Harry and Adelaide. “Did you love him, little baby Potter?” she questioned, twirling her wand between her fingers, a smirk rising wide on her lips. “And you, girl,” she focused in on Adelaide. “You did too.”Adelaide tried her best to ignore the sudden urge to vomit, swallowing down the bile that was rising in her throat.“Sirius did always like the blondes.” Bellatrix continued, “And young, too. I’m sure you made my dear old cousin very happy… it’s too bad I killed him.” She guffawed, clapping her hands together gleefully.At this point, Adelaide was losing her battle with keeping her composure. Her hands were trembling and before she could even shoot another hex, or a jinx, something – anything -, Harry lunged forward and screamed, “Crucio!”“Harry, no!” Adelaide cried. No matter how much she hated the women before them and wanted her to suffer, she didn’t want Harry to have that on his conscious. Using an Unforgiveable Curse was not something to be taken lightly. She wouldn’t know, personally, but she had done so much reading on them during, and after, school.Bellatrix stumbled backwards, a smug grin on her face as Harry’s cast of the Cruciatus Curse did not have the desired affect on her.“Oh, come on, dearie. You have to mean it!” She screeched, waving her hands around wildly, already beginning to stalk just a bit closer to the duo. “If you really wanted to cause pain and suffering, Potter, you need to mean it. You’re just an angry little boy. But not to worry, I can teach you.”Bellatrix raised her wand, her thin hand twisting as she shouted, “Crucio!”Harry ducked quickly, diving over to the side and behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren. He had squeezed his eyes shut on the way down, cradling his head forward into his chest as he did so. He could have sworn he heard screaming and was almost terrified of opening his eyes to see where it was coming from.Adelaide was unable to move out of the way fast enough. Bellatrix was powerful and fast, and the moment the curse hit Adelaide, square in the chest, her back bent in an unnatural way as she fell to the ground, screaming in pain. The curse coursing through her veins was causing her to feel extremely overheated. Sweat was already covering her forehead as her head tilted back, eyes wide in fear as she writhed in pain.Screaming. Crying. Whatever her body would let her do. Which was not much. Luckily, the curse had only lasted for a short while as Harry had jumped back up from the ground behind the fountain, shooting off stunning spells in Bellatrix’s direction, breaking her concentration on Adelaide.Adelaide could barely gather a coherent thought. Pain was still radiating through her body, aching each bone, tendon, muscle, everything. Tears were streaming down her cheeks as she attempted to roll over onto her stomach and crawl towards the door. She heard footsteps and was unaware if it was incoming Death Eaters, or The Order.“Hand over the prophecy, Potter.” Bellatrix demanded. “This little fight… Sorry to say that it won’t end well for you. Do you even know who you’re dealing with? Didn’t my dear cousin tell you all about me? I am the Dark Lord’s most powerful and loyal servant.” She cried, a wide, smug grin stretching her lips as she continued with the duel.A laugh began bubbling up in his chest as he stood again, shooting spell after spell in Bellatrix’s direction. “It’s been destroyed.” Harry yelled, diving back behind the fountain to dodge another spell sent his way. He was distracting himself from the searing hot pain coming from his scar. It had taken a while for him to realize what this meant.Voldemort.“You’re lying!” Bellatrix refused to believe this. She continued to go back and forth with Harry in their duel until she heard a familiar voice break through the barrier.Harry was surprised that she had sounded nervous, scared even, at this new information about the prophecy being destroyed. He continued shooting stunning spell after stunning spell at Bellatrix, refusing to give up – even after the chilling new voice joining them.Adelaide was listening to the best of her ability. Aside from only hearing her own heartbeat and the sound of her rapid breathing, she felt like her senses were beginning to return to normal. Merlin, Sirius is going to be so mad at me for getting hit, she thought to herself and after a moment of clarity, she realized that was impossible now. Sirius was gone. He was really gone. A sob racked her entire being, sending her body to curl up on her side as she pressed her cheek into the tile floor beneath her.A small bubble of pride swelled in her chest as she realized how strong Harry actually was. Sirius had been right along. Harry could handle it. He could handle this war, the fighting – maybe not the death that came along with it – but it was natural to act off emotion. After all, Adelaide did the same thing and she considered herself to be much older, and more mature, than Harry. He was born to be a strong wizard and at just fourteen, it was apparent he would do amazing things for their world. She let out a groan as she tried to continue crawling away. Harry had Bellatrix occupied so she was silently praying that she would be able to get away.Her bones were aching tremendously, and she was finding it hard to continue moving. Her vision became blurry as she laid her head back down against the cold, tile floor. As she blinked away more tears, Adelaide could see a light red blob heading in her direction. As the blob got closer, the blurriness starting to fade.“C-Charlie?”“Hey, hey. Just relax. Don’t move.” Charlie whispered as he knelt beside Adelaide, lovingly brushing strands of hair from her forehead, pulling the strands that were sticking to her skin that was now slick with sweat. He could tell that she had been hit was something nasty. A part of him refused to think it had been an Unforgivable Curse. He knew about the effects of the Cruciatus Curse but only from his studies. He could see the pain Adelaide was still going through. Not only physical pain, but mental pain as well. Her boyfriend was dead, and she barely had time to think about what had happened before she ran off with Harry after Sirius’ cousin and killer.Adelaide could barely hear, or at least focus, on what Charlie was telling her. She was feeling lightheaded and found herself unable to tell Charlie this. She felt his hands scoop beneath her knees and behind her shoulders, pulling her up and into his chest. The sudden movement send a rush of dizziness over her. Instead of her head falling to the side, curling into his chest, her head flung back, and her eyes rolled back and up – showing nothing but the whites of her eyes now.The last thing she heard, and clearly, was the sound of Dumbledore’s voice booming through the large atrium.“It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way.”

J U N E 1996, G R I M M A U L D P L A C E“I didn’t even hear her leave the house.” Molly whispered softly to Charlie, glancing around her son’s arm to take a quick peak at Adelaide, who was still lying unconscious on the bed she had once shared with Sirius. “This is all my fault. She’s hurt because of me. I should have kept a closer eye on her. I should have known she would do something like this. She’s gotten more brazen with age, this one has.”Charlie couldn’t help but let out a soft laugh. He glanced over at his mum, a small smile appearing on his lips before he moved over to sit on the edge of the bed. “Don’t blame yourself, Mum. Addy has certainly gotten more confident in the past few years. You would have had to hold her against her will to stop her from going.”“A woman in love will do crazy things, Molly.” Tonks now spoke up. She had been stretched out beside Adelaide on the bed, sitting with her back against the headboard and her hand gently brushing through her best friend’s hair in a calming manner, almost motherly.Charlie nodded silently. “She should wake up soon. I gave her a small dose of dreamless sleep to make sure she didn’t want up in hysterics.”“I’ll go put some tea on the stove. Your father just finished packing up all our things. Remus thinks it’ll be best if we go back to The Burrow before night fall.” Molly rested her hand on Charlie’s shoulder for a moment before leaning down to kiss his cheek.Once Molly left the room, Tonks looked up at Charlie with a sad smile.“How are you holding up?” she asked, glancing down at Adelaide when she felt the girl shift, luckily still deep in sleep with the help of magic.“Me?” Charlie scoffed, shaking his head. He reached over to gently rest his hand over Adelaide’s, running his thumb along the smooth skin on the back of her hand.  “It doesn’t matter how I’m feeling. It’s Adelaide that matters…only her.”Charlie sighed again. “And you… Sirius was your cousin. Have you told your mum yet?”Tonks nodded solemnly. “Yes. Sent a patronus once we brought Addy back here.”Charlie brought his hand back to his lap, his head bent back as he stared up at the ceiling. “T-This is only the beginning, Tonks. I’m not sure I understood that this was what I signed up for.”Tonks moved off the bed, now walking around to the other side before pulling Charlie up in a hug. This had been the most she had ever been intimate with him. She hugged him fiercely. “You’re a powerful wizard, Charlie Weasley. The Order needs you… Adelaide needs you. I need you, too, though if you tell anyone I said that I’ll have to hurt you.” She chuckled softly and pulled back, glancing up at her friend.Charlie hugged Tonks back just as fierce. He was nervous about how Adelaide would be after losing Sirius. If she would be able to handle this kind of loss. After all, the initial shock sent her chasing after a Death Eater alongside a fourteen-year-old boy. Of all the years Charlie knew her, he would have never guessed she’d do something like that.Waking with a loud gasp, Adelaide shot up from her position on the bed. Her eyes were wide, tears already streaming down her cheeks as she started looking around in a panic.“Addy… Addy, breathe. Come on, breathe for me.” Charlie grabbed her hands to try and calm her down. Tonks rushed to the other side of Adelaide, wrapping her in her arms protectively.“I’m breathing! I’m breathing!” Adelaide snapped, yanking her hands from Charlie’s before she wiggled her way out of Tonks’ grasp. She stood up too fast as her legs gave out – her muscles still sore from being hit with the Cruciatus Curse.“Whoa, relax.” Charlie quickly grabbed onto Adelaide’s arms to hold her up, stabilizing her in his grasp.“Charles Weasley.” Adelaide shimmied herself out of his grasp. “Don’t you dare tell me to relax.” She looked over to the bed, a longing gaze sent to the mattress where she last slept next to the man she loved. The man who was no longer with her. There had to be something she could do to bring him back. This was not how their story was going to end.“I have to go.” Adelaide spoke up again once she was able to pull her gaze away from the bed. Her throat was still sore and each word that she expelled from her mouth hurt more than the last. “I-I have to bring him back.”With that, Adelaide instantly turned and rushed out of the room. She heard Charlie and Tonks call after her. Their footsteps sounded so far away but in reality, they had been right there behind her from the get-go. Her legs were shaking with each step but somehow, some way, she managed to make it to her lab.Throwing the door open with a painful hiss, Adelaide rubbed at her wrist for a moment before she found herself standing in front of the bookshelf on the right-hand side of the room. She knew Sirius had stocked the shelves with some of his favorites from the Black family library, but he had also managed to obtain many different types of ancient texts. All for her. He really, truly knew the way to her heart.Books.Adelaide was already getting started tearing through the shelves, books caving down around her and collapsing to the floor as she tried to find what she was looking for.“I know it’s in here somewhere. It has to be here!”Tears were already streaming down her cheeks again as she tried her best to blink them away to clear her blurry vision so she could read the titles.“Adelaide, please, listen to us.” Tonks was the one to speak up now. As they pursued Adelaide through the hallways of number twelve Grimmauld Place, Tonks had told Charlie that he should let her handle everything in terms of talking Adelaide down. Charlie instantly took offense, but deep down he knew Tonks was right.He was never one for saying the right thing at the right time, anyway.“I’m listening, I’m listening.”With a sigh, Tonks glanced at Charlie shooting him a look of concern before turning her attention back onto Adelaide. She was beginning to sound more manic as the minutes passed by. Tonks had never read about the veil and the Death Chamber at the Ministry, but she did know one thing.Sirius was not coming back. There was no way for him to return. But how could she break that to Adelaide?“We need to pack your things. You need to go home. Now that Sirius is gone, “Tonks gulped. And quite loudly at that. She hated having to be the stern and sensible one, but Adelaide needed to hear this. “Bellatrix may try to come here. She thinks Grimmauld Place belongs to her.”“It doesn’t belong to that murderous bitch.” Adelaide spat angrily. Her hands were shaking as she continued searching through the shelves for the book she knew was there. “Sirius wanted to bring Harry here. He wanted us to be a family. We were supposed to be a family.” The tears began falling at an even quicker rate now. Her hands clutching onto the shelf before her for support as she felt her legs begin to shake and her muscles begin to spasm.Luckily with quick reflexes, Tonks reached out and steadied Adelaide in her arms. At the firm and loving touch, Adelaide broke down even more. This was her home now. This place had been her home for quite some time now. How was she going to make it? She had never felt this kind of pain before. This tremendous loss of life – of love.Charlie stood frozen in the doorway. He had not moved an inch closer, for fear that he would set Adelaide off. He was fine with her taking things out on him. He would go through hell if it meant she would be happy, and safe, in the end. He had promised Sirius just yesterday that he would do whatever was needed to protect Adelaide. Charlie Weasley was a man of his word.“How’s she fairing?” Remus spoke up from behind Charlie.Turning around to face the older man, Charlie shook his head. Remus must have just floo’d in from the Ministry. He had been by Dumbledore’s side all night, working to help him get the kids back to school and to make sure the Minister didn’t try to twist the story of what really happened there that night.“Not well.” Charlie replied with a shake of his head. He shifted to lean against the frame of the door, gesturing with his eyes for Remus to join him and look for himself.With that, Remus stepped through the threshold and felt his heart break all over again. Tonks was now on the floor with Adelaide in a comforting embrace. Tonks had her arms tightly wrapped around the healer, pulling her back into her and slowly rocking back and forth. One the outside, Tonks did not seem to have any maternal instincts. She was a jokester – had been one her whole life.“Let it out, Addy. It’ll be ok. I promise you. I won’t leave your side until you kick me out.” Tonks whispered with a soft laugh. All the metamorphagus wanted was for her best friend to not be in anymore pain. The tears being shed right now were ten times worse, if not more, than the ones she had once shed for Charlie. Tonks understood the difference, of course. She knew that there was just no comparison between the heartaches.“I don’t want to leave. Please don’t make me leave, Tonks. What if Sirius comes back? I need to be here.” Adelaide whispered to Tonks. Her voice was becoming extremely congested as fluids were leaking from every possible opening on her face. The tears were beginning to slow down, but her vision was still slightly blurred from the swelling that would most likely stick around for the next few days.“Adelaide, I need you to listen to me.” Tonks pulled back so she could look her friend in the eyes. She quickly glanced over Adelaide’s shoulder to nod at Remus and Charlie – choosing to ignore the flip of her stomach at seeing Remus leaning into the doorway. Merlin, that man is handsome.“Sirius is gone.” Tonks whispered, her hands now moving to cup Adelaide’s cheeks. She held her firmly, though made sure she wasn’t hurting her. “He’s not coming back, love. He can’t come back. But that doesn’t mean that you will ever have to forget him.” Tonks soon moved one hand to Adelaide’s chest, resting it over her heart. “He will always be with you. In here. In your heart. And your mind. But his body and his soul, they’ve gone away from the land of the living.”Tonks was running out of things to say. She was trying her best to comfort her friend – trying her best to get through to her.“I’ve known Sirius a long time, Adelaide.” Remus now stepped forward, walking towards the two women cuddled up on the floor, dozens of books strewn on the floor around them. “He hated when we worried about him.” Though the man was also in pain at the loss of another one of his oldest friends, Remus knew he had to remain strong for those around him.“He loved you. So bloody much.” Remus knelt beside Adelaide and gently took her hand in his. “He wouldn’t want you to lose yourself in your grief. Tonks is right in that he will always be with you.”Adelaide stayed silent. She wanted to believe that in one of these books surrounding them on the floor that there was information about retrieving a soul from beyond the veil. She gave Remus’ hand a slight squeeze before she turned to look over at Charlie. He looked like he was grieving – a different kind of grief than hers.“Now, your body has been through a tremendous amount of trauma. We need to get your things together and get you out of here. Dumbledore is concerned that Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters will try to take hold of this place.” Remus stated.Charlie shifted his weight from foot to foot as he maintained eye contact with Adelaide from the doorway. “I’ll help you pack. And I can make sure you get to your parents house safely.” He offered with a pressed smile.Adelaide was exhausted, both mentally and physically. She nodded silently and allowed Remus and Tonks to help her up. She promised them both that she would be ok, and Charlie agreed from his place by the door. He had not moved an inch, refusing to step foot any closer to Adelaide. His heart was breaking at seeing her this way. Knowing that she was in pain and that it was the type of pain that nobody would be able to help her with.“You two go on.” Adelaide hugged Remus first, then Tonks. “I’ll be with Charlie. I’ll be ok. Thank you.”Remus walked out with Tonks, most likely to head to a few more rooms within the house to make sure that they didn’t leave anything of importance behind.Adelaide stood by her workbench now. Her fingertips gently traced along the countertop as she began staring off into space. Everything she saw, everything she touched – it reminded her of Sirius.Would she be able to move on? How would she go to work, take care of sick patients, and know that she had no power in saving the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with? Time heals all wounds, right? Because at this rate, Adelaide wasn’t so sure about that.

J U L Y 1996, C O R D E N R E S I D E N C EThirteen days. It had been thirteen long days without Sirius. Adelaide could barely eat. She could barely sleep. Most days she felt like she could barely breathe. She had only been granted three days off from work – after all, it wasn’t like she could tell them the specifics of why she was requesting off. She had simply told her supervisor that there was a death in the family and that she needed time to grieve as well as make the proper arrangements.Her heart broke every time she thought of Sirius not getting a proper burial. There was no body to bury, she knew the logistics of it, but she still wanted to have something for him. He deserved it. He deserved much more than what he got. It just wasn’t fair.Waking up after sleeping two hours, at most, Adelaide hated looking around and seeing her childhood bedroom. Her sheets smelled like cinnamon – her mum’s favorite scent. Adelaide was almost certain that she smelled cinnamon just at the thought of her mum. The scent was nice – but it wasn’t the calming cedarwood smell that Sirius’ sheets had.Rolling over onto her side, Adelaide slipped her hand along the cool pillow next to her. She had slept alone for so long that she never realized she had taken waking up in Sirius’ arms for granted the way she did.With a soft sigh escaping her lips, the healer stretched her arms up above her head before rising from the bed. Luckily, she had off from work and had agreed to accompany Tonks to The Burrow later in the day.Her clothes were already hanging from her body loosely, and her hair had lost its shine. With each step forward, Adelaide felt the dizziness rise back up in her head which caused her to stop and lean against the dresser on the side of her room.Still suffering from the feeling of profound loss, Adelaide sunk into the chair at her vanity and stared up at her reflection. She was sickly looking. It made her feel sick to her stomach. The dark circles under her eyes had never been this bad and the overall haggard look she was sporting would certainly cause concern from her friends and family. She couldn’t remember the last time she ate a proper meal. Now that’s not to say that her mother, and Molly, didn’t try to hand feed her as often as possible.After staring at herself for another silent moment, Adelaide made her way to the bathroom to shower. The scalding hot water cascaded down her face as well as the rest of her body as she raised her arms to prop herself up against the wall. It felt nice and almost relaxing enough to where she started to doze off, but she quickly came to when she heard the bathroom door opening.“Hello?”“Wotcher Addy, it’s just me.” Tonks called out softly, leaning against the doorframe as billows of steam wafted through the air.“You’re early.” Adelaide called back, chewing on her bottom lip for a moment before she tugged the shower curtain back just a bit to poke her head out and look over at her friend. “I’m ok, Tonks, I promise.” She told her, forcing a small smile as she gave her a nod.“We know you’re ok. Charlie and I just thought maybe we could come earlier and bring you to the Burrow. The weather is beautiful, and we can spend time outside by the lake.”Adelaide cocked a brow, “You? Spend time in nature?”“Don’t’ make me regret my decision in saying yes to Weasley about this!” Tonks shot back, though a grin quickly spread wide on her lips. Just like Charlie, she would do just about anything to put a smile on Adelaide’s face. She had been spending most of her free time with either Remus, making sure he was doing ok, or with Adelaide. And with the impending doom on the horizon, the work of an Auror was needed everywhere and anywhere these days.“Let me finish in here and then I’ll be out. I don’t know if I’ll be great company down by the lake….” Adelaide popped back into the shower to quickly shampoo and condition her hair, ignoring the large clumps that she was pulling from her hands as she stood beneath the stream of water.“I’m going to go raid your parents’ kitchen.” Tonks stated, making sure she projected her voice loud enough for Adelaide to hear over the sound of the water running, “Does your mom still keep those delicious buttermilk biscuits?”“Of course. Dad won’t stop complaining about his waistline because of them. You know where to find them. I’ll be down shortly.” Adelaide called, now moving to finish up the shower with soaping her body up. Her mum had bought her lavender soap, rifling off the muggle belief that it could help calm her. Adelaide had no idea if it was enhanced with any magic, but she doubted it because she was still not feeling calm even after a shower.Adelaide dried off quickly and stood before her closet with a careful look on her face. Since the day Sirius had died, she had only dressed herself in pajamas, or her work uniform. She felt stupid for being concerned about an outfit and quickly shook the anxious thoughts out of her mind as she reached in and grabbed the first thing she made contact with.She had pulled the black dress down over her head, pulling at the material until it slipped past her hips and rested by her knee. She slipped her feet into a pair of sandals and made her way to the kitchen, catching Tonks in the act of stuffing a, what Adelaide assumed was her second, muffin into her mouth.“Have your fill?” Adelaide teased, a genuine smile starting to form on her lips as she watched Tonks lick her lips, swallowing the evidence as quickly as she possibly could.“They’re just so bloody delicious, Ads. Your mum is a great baker…” Tonks, who was now sporting her bright bubblegum pink hair again, paused, “But wait, don’t tell Molly I said that.”“Deal.” Adelaide laughed as she left out a breath. Her eyes fell to the window just above the sink and she walked over to stand in the stream of sunlight coming in. “It does feel nice in the sun… I haven’t been out in the sun for a while.”“That’s why I’m here. And it’s why we’re heading down to the lake by the Burrow. Some sun will do you good. I told them we’ll just take the floo, makes the most sense. You ready?” Tonks brushed her hands together, furthering removing any evidence of the muffin crumbs from her person.“Sure. I’m ready.” Adelaide cleared her throat, reaching forward to pull the window shut since nobody would be home while she was gone. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇T H E B U R R O WAfter, reluctantly, greeting every Weasley to have ever been born, Adelaide found herself walking out the back door and down towards the lake alone. The sun felt nice against her skin, but she couldn’t help but still feel the aching, sick feeling deep in her belly.“Addy! Wait up!” Charlie was now rushing through the grass to reach the petite blonde, his hand reaching out to gently rest on the back of her arm. “I’m sorry… was it too much with everyone there when you got in?”Adelaide looked up at Charlie and let out a soft sigh. “Honestly?” She began, chewing back her bottom lip. “Yes. But that’s ok. I’ll be ok. Just needed some fresh air… haven’t had much of it recently. I go from work, back to my bed, then back to work again.” she admitted feebly. To be honest, she was embarrassed that she was not able to function more properly. It had been nearly two weeks and she was beginning to think if something was wrong with her.“You’re still grieving, Adelaide. Everyone grieves differently in their own ways.” Charlie smiled, hoping to get her to smile back but all she did was avoid his eye contact and continue walking towards the lake.After a while, the entire Weasley clan had joined the makeshift picnic by the lake. The last one to join was Bill, and there had been a quiet, reserved woman by his side. Adelaide continued staring, knowing that it was quite rude, but she knew she had looked familiar.“Charlie?” She whispered, reaching over to nudge the red head who was laying out on a towel beside her, his face hidden in his arms. After a moment of silence, she leaned down and listened closely. After a small snore had escaped his mouth, she let out a laugh. “Wake up, you bloody wanker.” She hissed, swatting the back of his head, and quickly leaned back once he shot up from his sleeping position.“What? What is it? Are you ok?” Charlie struggled to catch his breath, ignoring the cackling laughter escaping Tonks from the other side of Adelaide.“Merlin, Charlie, you must have really been asleep.” Adelaide teased him. At this exact moment – she felt free. She felt happy for the first time in two weeks. It was a nice feeling. The warmth spread through her chest and down into her stomach, knocking away the sadness and nausea as it went.“I wanted to ask you who that was. She looks so familiar. I don’t remember Bill bringing her to any of our meetings.”Charlie glanced over his shoulder, following Adelaide’s line of sight as he did. “Yes, that’s because he’s tried to keep her out of it all. Her name is Fleur Delacour. You’ve most likely heard us talk about her. Mum isn’t…the biggest fan of Bill’s girlfri-““Everyone! Your brother has some news he’d like to share.” Molly spoke up, loud enough for everyone to hear. Fred and George, who was both fooling around in the water, causing a scene, halted abruptly. They knew better than to piss their mum off when it came to something that seemed this important.“I’ve asked Fleur to marry me!” Bill said, a genuine smile broke out as he slipped his free hand along his fiance’s back until it rested on her hip, pulling her in close against his side.“We’re sorry for your loss!” Fred and George both called out to Bill, laughter erupting from them as they both gave one another a high five.“Bloody brilliant, you two,” Bill rolled his eyes playfully. “She said yes. We’re getting married!”As fast as the warmth had spread throughout Adelaide’s body, it had left. She slipped her hand along her chest, grabbing hold of the ring she was still wearing around her neck. Everyone, excluding herself and Tonks, stood up and walked over to congratulate the two. Adelaide felt sick. She should be happy for her friend – and she was – but there was a hidden compartment in her brain that instantly opened its doors and reminded her that she was not going to be marrying the man she loved. Not anymore. Because he was gone.Because he was dead.Tonks rubbed her back, doing her best to be as loving as possible. It was sometimes a struggle for Tonks, and Adelaide had always understood that about her friend. She never held that against her. She loved her for who she was. Flaws and all.“I’m ok, Tonks. Thank you.” Adelaide gave her friend’s knee a gentle pat before she gathered her courage and pushed herself up to head over and congratulate the happy couple.She had been able to make it a few minutes of conversation with Fleur, Bill, and Charlie before she announced she had forgotten something in the house and would be back. Charlie, though, was aware this was the only excuse she could come up with to get away from them.She had made it as far as the first two steps before Charlie caught up with her. “You’re not leaving yet, are you?” he called out.Turning around for a moment, Adelaide shook her head and held onto the railing for support as she faced Charlie. She refused to have him see her cry. She felt so pathetic. So stupid. She was actually upset that Bill was engaged. Why couldn’t she shake this feeling? She started up the steps again, frantically wiping at her face to remove the tears, although it really was no use because the tears could not be stopped. She had been crying every day for the past two weeks. A part of her believed that her nose would be permanently red, her eyes permanently puffy, and not to mention that she felt like she was constantly sniffling and wiping at her face. In other words, she was a mess.Charlie sighed softly, walking over to the stairs as he watched her walk away. He knew she was most likely heading to his old bedroom. And that was ok with him. He waited until he heard the tell-tale sign of her entering his room – the squeaky handle gave it all away. He wasn’t sure why his dad wouldn’t just use magic to fix it, but that’s here nor there.“Fuck.” Adelaide groaned, aggressively rubbing at her face again before she started pacing the floor in front of Charlie’s old desk. She was chewing away at the inside of her cheek, almost hard enough to spill blood. Luckily, a book on the desk to her right caught her eye and caused her to slow down – both her steps and her chewing.“Charlie, you bloody bastard.” She whispered to herself upon further inspection of said book. Her fingers pressed against her lips as she read the title of the book. Beyond the Veil by: Arcturus Flannigan. This had been the book she tried to find the morning after Sirius passed. Once she felt her breathing return to normal, Adelaide reached forward to pluck the book from its spot and move to the bed by the window. The sunlight still felt nice on her skin as it streamed through the windowpane. She wasn’t sure why Charlie had this. Why had he taken it from Grimmauld Place?She opened the book, letting her fingertips brush along the rough first page. She did her best to ignore the chills running through her body as she began flipping through the pages. Some of them had been dog-eared. “Merlin, he’s ruined these pages…” she groaned to herself.Jumping at the squeaking of the knob, Adelaide turned to face the door. “Charles Weasley.” She held the book up now, shaking it a bit in the air as she did so. “You have some explaining to do. What are you doing with this book? And why have you bloody ruined the pages?”Charlie blushed. He had almost forgotten all about that particular pet peeve of Adelaide’s. She would slap and pinch him anytime he did it to his texts while at Hogwarts. “Ah, well, you see the thing is…” Charlie cleared his throat as he shut the door behind him. Walking over to the bed, he gestured to the spot besides her and she nodded with approval.Charlie sat down and let out a sigh. “Here,” He took the book and chewed on his bottom lip for a moment. He didn’t want her to think he was trying to mess with her emotions or anything. This was an extremely delicate situation, and he knew he had to tread lightly.“I’ve been doing as much research as possible. About the veil. It’s properties… if anyone has ever come back from physically crossing its boundary.” Charlie looked up at Adelaide and could see the hope rising in her eyes as she watched him.“And?” she questioned him, a look of anticipation spreading across her features.This was the part that would hurt the most.“Nothing.” Charlie sighed out, his grasp tightening on the book before he leaned over and set it down on the bedside table. “I’m so sorry, Addy. I’ve read this book twenty-five times already. There has not been any success with bringing someone back from the veil. It’s impossible.”Adelaide shrunk down instantly when Charlie broke the news – the news she feared the most, but also knew to be true. She knew there could be no way – but there was a tiny glimpse of hope in her brain, holding on by a single thread. As Charlie reached forward and slipped his hands into hers, giving her a tight squeeze to try and bring her back down, Adelaide felt that final string pull tight and snap within her.Sirius was never coming back. She couldn’t save him. She couldn’t hear his laugh just one more time. She couldn’t kiss his lips and feel his mustache tickle her nose. She would never know what it felt like to have his body fit with hers like the perfect puzzle that they were.“I’m so sorry.” Charlie repeated. He was unsure if Adelaide was ok with the affection he was showing her. But since she had not pulled away, he shifted to lean back against the headboard and pull her into his side. His arms wrapped around her firmly and he began rubbing her upper arm in a loving, soothing manner.“It’s not your fault, Charlie.” She finally whispered, letting her head fall against his chest as the tears began streaming down her cheeks again. “It’s my fault. I distracted him. I am the reason he’s gone…he’s dead because of me and my stupidity. I don’t know how I will ever be able to forgive myself.”“It’s not your fault, either. Addy, you know Sirius would not want you to blame yourself.” Charlie was at a loss for words. He didn’t know what else to say. He was typically good at comforting his friends but having never gone through the loss of a loved one as dear as Sirius was to Adelaide, he couldn’t come up with the right things to say.Adelaide remained quiet. She squeezed her eyes shut, as tight as she could – willing the tears to stop. Eventually they did and she shifted to sit up and wipe at her cheeks. “Thank you.” She told him, forcing a small smile before she glanced back to the window.“I haven’t told anyone this,” Adelaide now moved to stand and lean against the windowsill, looking to the lake as she watched the Weasley family start to eat the lunch spread Molly had prepared. “But I’ve barely slept since he died.”“That’s normal behavior, Ads.” Charlie spoke softly, “I have some Draught of Dreamless Sleep if you’d like some. I can always go out and get some more.” He got up to dig around in the bedside drawer.“No!” She whipped around quickly, shaking her head. “No. I don’t want that. I-It’s the only way I’d be able to see him.” She chewed back on her bottom lip to try and stop the quiver. “I mean, I sleep maybe for two hours at a time… But I dream of him. Charlie, I get to see him again and…”She sat back down on the bed with a sigh.“Are they nightmares?” Charlie asked, a frown forming on his lips. He hated seeing his best friend like this. It was tearing him apart.“Yes.” She nodded. “But that’s ok, because I get to see him…”“No, it’s not ok. It’s tearing you apart from the inside out, Adelaide.” Charlie continued digging around the drawer. He knew he had a vial of some Draught of Peace. Maybe that could help her. Once he found it, he turned to face her and held his hand out. “This is Draught of Peace. I promise you that’s all it is. Maybe this will help.”Adelaide looked warily for a moment. Her fingertips were tapping along her knees as she thought about taking the vial from Charlie. After fighting with herself, she reached out and took the vial.“You need help, Addy. And it’s ok to ask for you. I promise you that I will be right here. Always. And you know we can’t get rid of Tonks.” Charlie tried his best to bring another smile to her face. A small hint of one appeared, and he knew that eventually she would be ok. He would make sure of it.As she sat upon Charlie’s bed, staring at the vial in her hands, Adelaide knew she was exhausted. Maybe this would help her fall asleep. Maybe this would somehow help keep the nightmares at bay. She didn’t want to not dream. She was afraid that she would never see Sirius’ face again. Just looking at a picture wasn’t enough for her. Her nightmares felt so real, and to have to relive the moment Sirius slipped through the veil was extremely painful but a part of her felt like it was necessary for her survival.“Will you stay with me until I fall asleep?”Charlie nodded, almost too eagerly. This was all he had wanted – Adelaide letting him in. He wanted to be there, in any way, for his best friend. This could be the first step into healing for her. “I’m not going anywhere.” He whispered.Adelaide nodded. She downed the potion quickly, trying not to gag at the taste. It wasn’t the worst tasting potion she had ever had to take, but it wasn’t the best either. She shoved the cork back into the neck of the vial and handed it back to Charlie before she turned away from him to lay down, slipping her frail frame beneath the blankets.Charlie stayed put, siting against the headboard as he watched over Adelaide. He wasn’t sure how much time had passed but he reached down to brush some of her hair out of her face after he realized her breathing evened out and the soft cries had ceased.“Sweet dreams, Adelaide.”

Fresh sunlight streamed through the open window of Adelaide’s childhood bedroom. She found herself blinking a few times to adjust to the brightness of the room.“Wotcher Addy!” Tonks came bounding into the room, a large trunk floating behind her. With the flick of her wrist, the trunk gently, surprisingly so, settled on the floor at the foot of Adelaide’s bed.“Good morning to you, too, Nymphadora.” Adelaide smirked from beneath her sheets, making sure she was prepared to block anything that Tonks threw at her.Tamping down her anger at the use of her first name, Tonks forced a smile. “Adelaide Corden. Today is a special day. And I am not going to hurt you.” Tonks moved to open the trunk, a happy grin spreading wide upon her face as she peeked at what was inside. “After all, what would my dear old cousin, Sirius, say if I had to tell him I hurt his bride on their wedding day?”Adelaide was beaming. Her hand slipped from beneath the sheets as she stared up at the shining gem resting on her left ring finger. Today was really the day. The day she married her soul mate.“By the end of the day, Tonks, we’ll officially be related. By marriage, of course, but isn’t that exciting?” Adelaide giggled softly as she now stood up and stretched her body, enjoying the satisfying feeling of some of her joints cracking.Adelaide then met Tonks by the trunk, eyes wide and already glistening with tears as she looked down at her wedding dress. It had been in her family would generations and she thought it was still beautiful as when the first woman on her mother’s side of the family wore it on her own special day.Letting Tonks use her wand to lift the dress and hang it on the back of the door, Adelaide made her way into the bathroom. She showered quickly before walking back out in a white, silk robe. Her new initials had been stitched, with love, on the front – courtesy of Molly Weasley, of course.It had not taken long for her room to fill up with other people. Her mother, Adele, stood behind her at the mirror. Looking at one another through the mirror, Adelaide could feel the love in the room surrounding her. It made her feel warm, and happier than she could have ever imagined.“I’m not nervous. Is that bad? Should I feel nervous?” Adelaide moved her head, stopping her mother from playing with the veil she had now attached to her.“That’s nonsense, my love.” Adele shook her head and fixed the veil before she helped her daughter stand up and began fixing the beautiful dress, double checking to make sure there were no flaws in the lace layers. “When you’re getting married to your true soul mate, there is nothing to ever be nervous about. Molly and I can attest to that.”Molly smiled from her position behind Tonks. The Weasley matriarch was assisting the unruly hair of the metamorphagus, trying to ignore the changing color as it was obvious Tonks was feeling the anxiety of the day. “Your mother is right. With Arthur, I knew from the moment I laid eyes on him that he was the one for me. I’ve never had any second thoughts to anything from that day on.”“Molly, that is insanity.” Tonks exclaimed. The Auror knew what love was – after all, she was madly in love with one Remus J. Lupin, but there had been plenty of times that both had second guessed being with one another.“Love is crazy, Tonks.” Adelaide spoke up, glancing over at her friend with a smirk.Adele and Molly had finished helping the girls get ready before they both took their leave. Tonks was too busy complaining about the dress being too tight as she continuously twirled before the mirror.“Am I allowed in?” Charlie had opened the door slightly, knocking on the frame before moving any further in.“Yes, of course.” Adelaide felt nervous for the first time all morning. She stood back, leaning against the post of her bed frame.Charlie slipped in, quickly closing the door behind him so Sirius – who had been trying to sneak around the hallway to catch a glimpse of his future bride – could not see in.“Wow.” Charlie felt the breath leave his lungs as he stood there dumbfounded, looking down at both Adelaide and Tonks.“Thanks Charlie.” Tonks chuckled, patting him on the chest before she turned to look back at Adelaide. “I’ll give you two some privacy. You have ten minutes before we have to get this show on the road.”Adelaide and Charlie both stayed silent, never breaking their eye contact, until Tonks had closed the door behind her on the way out.“You look beautiful.” Charlie finally got out, a blush rising on his cheeks as he looked down at his best friend. He reached forward and brushed hair behind her shoulders. “All grown up.” He teased, a smile forming on his lips as he bent forward to gently kiss her forehead.Adelaide smiled warmly up at her best friend. She reached up and wrapped her fingers around his wrist, holding his hands near her face for a moment before she took a step back to turn and look at herself in the mirror. “To be honest, I always wondered what I would look like as a bride.” She admitted sheepishly, twirling a bit as she took in her appearance.“And?” Charlie questioned, “Is this how you would have imagined it?”Thinking about his question, Adelaide chewed on the inside of her cheek before glancing back at him. “Yes and no. But that’s a discussion for another day.” She waved her hand a bit before fixing her hair just once more before turning back around to face him.The soft notes of the piano drifted through the air – no doubt her mother behind the keys. The wedding day jitters were slowly starting to creep up on her, but Adelaide knew this was everything she had ever wanted.The Dark Lord was finally defeated – for good. Harry, though an adult, was living with them. They were finally free. And merlin, were they happy. Completely unadulterated love. It was pulsing through her veins, sending pins and needles through her fingers as she reached down to pick up the bouquet of flowers resting on the foot of her bed.“Let’s go get you married.”Charlie stepped to the side, gesturing for Adelaide to take his arm. Graciously, the blonde accepted and slipped her hand through his arm, resting gently in the crook of his elbow.They waited at the top of the steps until Tonks gave them the go ahead that Sirius was already waiting at the altar. Every step forward felt like time was moving at an incredibly slow speed, almost unnatural.Charlie bid Adelaide farewell, pressing a quick kiss to her forehead again before he exited the back door and found his spot in the row with the rest of the Weasley clan.Tonks was grinning from ear to ear. She was already beginning to bounce her weight around, foot to foot, as her large eyes peered out of the window of the kitchen door.“How does he look?” Adelaide tried to stop biting at her lip, she was afraid that she would break the skin since she was becoming nervous now that she was just a mere few minutes away from walking down the aisle. It was slightly unnerving to have all the attention – there was just something about having everyone turning around to watch her walk down the aisle.“He looks bloody nervous. Like he’s about to make a mess of himself.” Tonks admitted, a laugh escaping her lips as she then turned her attention to Remus. Merlin, that man was just beautiful.“Darling,” Mr. Corden stepped through the door, fidgeting with his bowtie for a moment before he stopped moving at the sight of his daughter. His only daughter, whom he was giving away in marriage.Choking back tears, Faustus cleared his throat. “Merlin, I’m not ready for this. Are you sure you want to do this, love?”Adelaide giggled, gently slapping her father’s arm before she leaned up and pecked his cheek. “Yes, Daddy. I’m sure. I had to grow up some day, right?”Sighing at his daughter’s response, Faustus knew she was right. He nodded and pecked her cheek back in return. “I suppose you’re right.”Adelaide slipped her arm around her fathers, sidling up next to him as she clutched her bouquet in her free hand.“Let’s get you married, little dove.” Faustus whispered, slowly beginning to follow Tonks down the aisle.At the exact moment Adelaide met Sirius’ gaze, it felt as though all the air in her lungs disappeared. Her chest felt right, and her head started to feel light. But oddly enough, it was a good feeling. A happy one, almost.The aisle felt much longer than it was. Adelaide felt her grip on her father’s arm tighten before they stopped one foot away from Sirius, who was standing with a proud smile on his face. His eyes were the brightest Adelaide had ever seen before. It was quite magical.“Take care of my daughter.” Faustus had tightly gripped Sirius’ hand, shaking it as he gave his daughter away.“Until my dying breath, I can assure you I will protect and love her with all that I have.” Sirius nodded. He turned to look at his bride, eyes still shining now though a hint of moisture was starting to brim the edges.Stepping up with their hands adjoined, Adelaide stared at Sirius with complete devotion. She could feel the warmth of the sun that was just beginning to set behind the trees behind them, and the gentle breeze that the wind provided that sent chills down her spine. The good kind of chills, of course.Their vows were short and sweet. Both Adelaide and Sirius knew that they didn’t need to stand up there for hours on end and profess their love publicly.“Addy?”Eyes darting around at the sound of her name being called, Adelaide could have sworn that the voice belonged to Charlie. Though when she looked over into the sea of people watching her on the altar, she realized his lips were not moving. The voice did not relent.”Adelaide, you’re crying.”The sun felt stronger, and the warmth of Sirius’ hands in hers pulled her back in.“Sirius, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded…”“I do.” His voice was husky and low, his fingers lacing with hers tightly holding her in place.“Adelaide, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded….”Adelaide opened her mouth to respond but nothing came out. She felt like she was trying her best to speak but everything in the universe was against her.“Adelaide, please.”Sirius held tightly onto her hands. “Don’t leave, love. Not yet.”Adelaide cocked an eyebrow. “What? What are you talking about?”She took another look around as the warmth was ripped from her skin. Everyone around her disappeared, slipping away from her sight like dust in the air.“What’s happening?” she turned back to Sirius, holding onto his hands tightly. “Please tell me what’s happening.”“It’s time to go.” Sirius whispered back, letting go of her hands so he could hold her face. He leaned down and pressed his lips against hers. The kiss was short, sweet, and even the taste of her tears that were freely flowing down her cheeks did not deter her from trying to deepen it. All she wanted was to be close to him. Feel his hands on her skin. She wanted to feel this every day for the rest of her life.“Where are we going?” she asked him once they pulled away from the kiss, her head coming to rest on his chest.“Not we, love. You.” Sirius stepped back from Adelaide, letting his hands run from her shoulders, down her arms, until they held onto her hands for another moment before letting go.“Addy?”Closing her eyes to blink away the tears, Adelaide felt Sirius slipping further and further away.“Addy!”Charlie’s voice sounded much closer now and the feeling the gentle touch upon her shoulder caused her eyes to open wide. A loud gasp escaped from her mouth as she looked around the room. She was breathing heavy, her limbs almost trembling as she came to the sudden realization that she had been dreaming.She looked down, no longer dressed in white. Her hands ran along her thighs before she turned to look at the figure seated beside her. The sky painted outside of the bedroom window was identical to the one she had just seen behind Sirius.“I don’t understand.” She whispered softly, letting Charlie wrap his arms around her shoulders so he could bring her into his chest. “It felt so real.”“Was it a good dream?” Charlie asked softly, beginning to rock his best friend back and forth in a comforting sway.Adelaide didn’t even have to think of an answer. She understood that the tears she was crying were happy tears. There was nothing sad about the dream she was, unfortunately, pulled from.“Y-Yes. Yes, it was.”

A U G U S T 1996, T H E B U R R O WIn the weeks that had passed since Adelaide dreamt of her wedding to Sirius, she was able to keep the nightmares at bay – for the most part, anyway. She had reluctantly agreed to brew her own batch of Draught of Peace, and even some Draught of Dreamless sleep. Charlie told her it was best to have it on hand, just to be safe.She agreed, even though she knew she would never take it. She still stuck by her word that she would rather have nightmares of him dying than no dreams at all.It was the end of summer and currently, she was laying out on a large blanket with Fleur. In the past weeks they had gotten closer. Fleur, though she was marrying the eldest Weasley, was still considered an outcast. Adelaide felt terrible that she was going through this, alone no less. Adelaide didn’t know what it was like to not be welcomed in with open arms by Molly.She knew Molly could be quite aggressive – though most of the time she meant it in a totally harmless, loving way.“How are you feeling?”Adelaide opened her eyes, shielding them from the strong summer sun as she glanced to her right at Fleur. “I’m ok.” She smiled softly, “Getting better every day, I think so anyway.”Fleur smiled back. “Good. I’m glad. You have a beautiful soul, Adelaide. I can see why my soon to be brother-in-law is so smitten with you.”Adelaide almost choked on her own saliva. She sprung up, turning to face the French native fully. “I’m sorry, what? You’re not talking about Ron, right? The poor boy will drool over anything with two legs and a nice pair of…” she stopped herself, having to remember that she wasn’t speaking with Tonks – who’s humor was just as crude, if not worse, than hers.Fleur raised a brow. “I’m going to choose to ignore the vulgarity you almost let slip!” though she ended up laughing anyway. “And no. Not Ronald.” She shook her head and sat up, fanning herself for a moment before she stood up and pulled on her little cover up.“Well?”“I mean, if I really have to spell it out for you, darling,” Fleur sighed, though a small smirk appeared on her lips. “We can table this discussion for later. I should go get ready for tonight.”With that, Fleur turned and sauntered, yes sauntered, away. Bill met her by the back door, a large grin spreading wide as he took in his future wife. “You look radiant.” He whispered, leaning down to kiss her lips softly before he was nudged to the side by Charlie.“Enough of that, you two. Your engagement party is tonight. You can wait until tonight for this public display of affection.” The second eldest Weasley teased, patting his older brother on the back before he smiled down at Fleur and moved to walk closer to the lake where Adelaide was now gathering up her things.The healer knew exactly who Fleur was referring to now. She glanced over her shoulder as she heard Charlie’s voice. She could have sworn she felt something come to life within her – for a split second – before she shook her head and folded the blanket before slipping her sundress back up over her body, now blocking her bare skin from being seen.The sun felt so nice against her skin, and it helped her ignore the sudden churning in the pit of her stomach as she heard Charlie start to call her name.“Are you heading home to get ready?” Charlie now stood beside Adelaide, taking the blanket from her so he could carry it for her back to the house.“Well, the party isn’t for a few more hours, but I think it would be easier if I stayed here so I could help Fleur and your mum. I’ll just let Fleur use the shower first since she’s the bride and will probably take longer to get ready.” Adelaide laughed softly, tucking strands of hair behind her ears as she started back towards the house with Charlie by her side.She was doing whatever she could to forget the conversation she had with Fleur only minutes prior. Charlie could not be smitten with her. It was true that he had been there for her in these past few weeks of grieving. But he was her best friend. It was his job to be there for her. Honestly, it would be like saying Tonks was smitten with her too because she had also been there for Adelaide every step of the way. It was ridiculous.“What a kind friend you are.” Charlie teased, elbowing her gently as he looked down at her. He let a smirk appear before he turned serious. “How are you feeling? Have you eaten yet today?”“I’m just fine, Mum.” She groaned, shoving Charlie away from her as she rushed into the house to get away from him.“That’s gross, don’t call me that!” Charlie yelled out as he followed her through the kitchen door, tossing the blanket into the laundry hamper that was hidden in the corner of the room.“I think he’s taken the mark.”

“Harry… I don’t think so. He’s just a boy.”

“Hermione, I know better now to trust my gut. I’m telling you both, Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater.”Adelaide had stopped at the new voice she heard in the living room. Her eyes went wide and almost instantly filled with tears. She pushed back the information they were discussing, atleast for now, because she wanted to see Harry more than anything.“Harry!” she cried, rushing over to the boy, and wrapping her arms around him in a tight, protective hug.She had not seen him since the end of June, after they had both run after Bellatrix Lestrange for murdering Sirius.The teenager wrapped his arms around her in return, just as tight as she had hugged him. After all, the boy had truly thought that she would have ended up being a large part of his life because of her love for his godfather, Sirius Black.Things did not always turn out the way that they were supposed to. But Harry knew that Adelaide was a good person. Not only that, but she was a hell of a healer, and this was the type of person he wanted in his corner when the time came for it. He knew that he would be able to count on her.“How are you? Staying out of trouble, I hope?” Adelaide smiled, pulling back to look at him. The boy was almost taller than her, and he was starting to look more mature with each passing day. Adelaide felt a small crack in her heart upon realizing that Sirius would not be around to watch his godson defeat the Dark Lord. Because that was exactly what Harry was going to do. She knew it. Deep down in her bones – Adelaide knew that Harry would be the one to save the wizarding world. Of course, he’d get by with a little help from his friends.They sank down onto the couch and got lost in conversation for a little bit. Charlie knew this was good and that it was something that she needed to continue in her healing process. He wouldn’t tear her away from that. Instead, he turned and got sucked into helping his mum with cleaning and baking. He was a terrible baker, something he had inherited from his father no doubt.“I’m sorry about that.” Adelaide rushed into the kitchen. Her eyes were red and puffy, which Charlie knew could only mean one thing – she had been crying with Harry. Adelaide always said crying was therapeutic, and even though she was now thinking of the death of the man she loved, she felt happy. They had traded stories, and since she spent more time with him, she had so much to tell Harry. They cried, they laughed, and they hugged some more.“I haven’t seen Harry since…” her voice trailed off and for a moment she felt as though she was going to become a blubbering mess all over again.Charlie instantly rushed to her side, wrapping his arms around her in an almost suffocating manner. But this was what Adelaide needed. The pressure of his muscular arms tightened around her helped bring her back down. After a few deep breaths, she pulled back. “Thanks Charlie. I’m ok. I promise.”She smiled up at him before glancing around him at Molly. “Do you need any help, Molly?”“Dearie, all I need from you is for you to enjoy yourself today. I promise you that is all I need.” Molly replied, waving them both off as she shooed them out of her kitchen.“Guess I should go get ready.” Adelaide wiped at her eyes for a moment before she walked up the stairs to shower and get herself ready for the party.She found herself taking longer than expected. She had the privacy in the bathroom and so she let herself cry for a little bit. Her tears mixing with the warm water spraying out of the showerhead above her. After she finished her crying session, she got out, dried her body with the towel and her hair with her wand. She could already hear music playing from outside and knew Fleur would be annoyed if she took any longer.Just like any other time she spent at the burrow, her things were in Charlie’s room because this was most likely where she was going to spend the time. Charlie had been respectful, having brought in another mattress from Bill’s old room so he could give her space on his tiny old bed.After she prepped her hair and makeup, which she always kept simple anyway, she pulled on the royal blue off-the-shoulder cocktail dress she had left Fleur talk her into wearing. The hem stopped mid-thigh and taking another glance at herself in the mirror, Adelaide let out a soft sigh. It had been a while since she dressed up and felt pretty and she found herself grateful that Bill and Fleur were trying to bring some normalcy to their lives. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇  The beginning of the night went well, Adelaide thought so anyway. Nobody fought. There were no tears – sad tears, anyway.Adelaide danced the night away with everyone and had dabbled in a bit too much firewhiskey with the twins. This was the first night since that fateful night in June that her drinking brought her to laughter instead of sobbing. Her hands wrapped around the neck of the bottle as she skipped through the grass and closer to the lake.She couldn’t even tell what time of night it was. Aside from the laughter and talking dying down behind her as the party started winding down, all Adelaide could hear was her own breathing and the crickets chirping away in the tall grass.“Addy!” Charlie was rushing after her, unable to shake the uneasiness of the intoxicated girl wandering off alone. She knew her way around the land, but he still couldn’t help but worry. If anything, he should probably try to get her inside and in bed.“Charlie!” Adelaide smirked as she turned, waving the bottle of firewhiskey. “Drink with me.” She moved to sit down in the grass and waited for him to join her. Charlie sat down immediately, taking the bottle from her.“You didn’t drink all of this by yourself, have you?”Charlie knew he had a decent amount of alcohol in his system, but he also knew he could tolerate it more than she could.“No. Fred and George helped me out.” She stated, sticking her tongue out at him before she hugged her knees to her chest, glancing out to the moon that was sitting high in the sky above them.Charlie took a sip before handing the bottle back to her. “You seem happy. It’s nice to see you smiling and dancing. Like the Adelaide I used to know.”For a moment her smile became sad, tears welling in her eyes before she looked over at Charlie. “I’m not happy. But… I’m getting there. I think.” She shrugged, wiping at her cheeks before she took a large swig of the firewhiskey. There was a silent alarm going off in her mind that was telling her to stop drinking. She wouldn’t listen to it, of course. The alcohol helped numb the part of her brain that forced her to think of Sirius every time she closed her eyes.They stayed side by side for a little while longer before they silently agreed to get up and head back to the house.By the time they neared the burrow, the party had been all cleaned up and nobody was outside.“Merlin, how long were we out there for?” Charlie chuckled softly, rubbing at his neck for a moment before he held the door open for Adelaide, letting her walk in before him.“Time is going so fast. It’s hard to say.” She responded with a shrug.Realizing that they had finished the bottle and it was now empty in her hands, Adelaide set it down on the kitchen table before she walked up the stairs and back to Charlie’s old room.Charlie followed her, turning off the lights as he went. It seemed like everyone was already in bed and he knew how much his mum hated the lights being left on.Once inside the room, Charlie had closed the door behind himself before turning around, getting caught off guard by the way Adelaide was standing there with her wand up in the air.“Ads?”“Muffliato.”It was clear Charlie was unsure what was going on in her mind. He watched as she tossed her wand behind her shoulder, and she walked over to him. She barely made a sound, the soft noise of her bare feet padding against the old hardwood floor sent chills down his spine. The way she was looking at him was so wrong, yet so right.“What are you do-“He was immediately cut off as Adelaide grabbed onto his shirt. She pushed him back against the door and without warning, pressed her lips against his roughly. This felt so different than all the other times his lips had touched hers. There was so much emotion behind her movements. Charlie knew it may not be the best thing for them to do – so why didn’t he stop her?A part of him had wanted to take things further that night, all those years ago, back at Hogwarts. He spent those years in Romania wondering how she tasted, how she felt under and around him. Now was his chance. Alcohol intake aside, the consent was there between them.  He turned his brain off, immediately, and let his hands reach up to cup her face and hold her against him as his lips parted and he took it painfully slow to finally get a good taste of her. She tasted like cake and firewhiskey. Honestly, it was a great combination on his tongue and the feeling of her hands moving down to his waist made it ten times better.“Are you sure?” he finally breathed out, pulling his lips from hers as he looked down at her. His eyes searched hers, trying to figure out how she was feeling and what she was thinking.“I need to feel something, Charlie.” Adelaide snapped, her hands grasping the bottom hem of his shirt before she pulled it up and tugged it over his head. She tossed the material behind her and instantly pressed herself forward to begin peppering hot, wet kisses against his chest.She knew Charlie was fit. Extremely fit. Not to say that Sirius was not fit – because he had been – but Charlie was certainly larger. His muscles were more defined, and she found herself concluding that it was all the hours he spent chasing after bloody fucking dragons.“I want you to fuck me senseless. I don’t want to be able to walk tomorrow.” Adelaide told him, dipping her fingertips beneath the waist of his trousers before slipping back up his chest, roaming over the burn scars he had accumulated over the years of working with dragons and not being healed appropriately.She looked up at him, waiting for him to give her a sign that he would do as she asked. And the moment she said his head shake up and down, giving her an eager yes, her hands grabbed onto his trousers as she tugged him back and shoved him down onto the edge of his bed.In her mind, she was mulling over the idea of giving him everything. She was going to use him to propel herself through the grief she was suffering. She didn’t want to bare all and have any sense of real intimacy with him. But as his hands grasped onto her bare thighs and pulled her between his legs, Adelaide felt all those thoughts slip from her mind.She ran her fingers through his hair and roughly pulled his head back as she began nipping and kissing along his neck.“Fuck, Adelaide.” Charlie choked out, not knowing that she had this control hidden deep within her. He didn’t know what she had done in the bedroom with Sirius – and he didn’t want to think of that – but he had always assumed she would be a meek, and submissive bedroom partner.He was wrong.Atleast in this situation he was.Adelaide raked her fingernails down his chest and dropped between his legs on her knees. She got his belt buckle undone and before a blink of an eye, Charlie’s trousers were now down around his ankles. She ripped them off and reached up to sensually palm his growing erection over his briefs. She could feel him getting hard and a proud smirk appeared on her lips as she looked up at him and watched his head fall back with a low groan.A part of her felt as though she was betraying Sirius. She was already feeling warm, a gratifying sensation seeping through her body and sending a slick wetness down between her thighs. In the time that she had been with him, she never once let another man turn her on. Maybe it was because she felt safe with Charlie.After all, she had a few ideas already on how to help feel anything but this grief that was still looming over her like a permanent dark cloud. Sleeping with her best friend was much safer than sleeping with strangers.Adelaide continued palming Charlie’s erection over the fabric of his briefs as she found herself reaching down to wiggle herself out of her now soaked pair of underwear. Once her center was free, the feeling of the cool air slipping through the window behind them sent chills down her spine.She reached up with both hands and pulled at the waistband of Charlie’s briefs and as soon as his fully erected member sprung free, a soft gasp escaped from her lips.“Charlie, you’re…”Merlin, he was huge.Honestly, he was the biggest she had ever seen or been with. And maybe this was strictly the alcohol talking but once she looked up and down his entire naked body, she bit down on her bottom lip.Charlie couldn’t help the blush rising on his cheeks. “I won’t hurt you.” He teased playfully, leaning down to slip his hands through her hair, pulling her up so he could meet her lips again. Her hands rested on his thighs for support as she leaned up and deepened the kiss.“What if I want you to hurt me?” She whispered against his lips. She pulled back to look at him before she wrapped one hand around his cock, giving him a few swift pumps before standing up before him. “I told you I wanted you to fuck me senseless, Charlie. I meant it.”She slipped herself up onto the bed, straddling his waist and already slowly teasing him as her hips rolled down against his own. The feeling of him between her legs sent an instant warmth to the pit of her stomach. She could feel herself getting more turned on, which was almost starting to become painful as all the blood rushed to her sensitive, sacred bundle of nerves.One hand moved to his shoulder to steady herself before she reached down between them to take hold of him and align the tip of his cock with her entrance. His hands slipped beneath the skirt of her dress, agitated that it was in his way as he grabbed onto her bare hips tightly. He held her firmly, guiding her down around him with a low moan.Adelaide moved down slow at first, both hands now grabbing onto Charlie’s shoulders for support as she felt him begin to stretch her open in the best way possible. She felt a slight sting but that feeling soon passed as she felt herself slowly ease down the entirety of his hard member.“Fuck…” she whimpered softly, chewing on her bottom lip as she stilled her hips in order to get accustomed to the feeling of fullness he was providing her. She willed away the tears – she refused to back out of this now. In some sick and twisted way, this was what she needed. She needed to feel something. Anything.And again…Charlie was safe.Charlie squeezed her hips as he looked up at her, taking in the way the moonlight brightened her face. Her eyes were shut as her head was falling back, sending her hair cascading back behind her shoulders. It was almost long enough to tickle the tops of his thighs. He moved one hand into the strands, grabbing hold of them closer to the base of her skull as he felt her hips begin to move, sliding up and down around his cock.He had imagined this moment for so long. She felt so much better than he could have ever imagined. She felt like she was made for him. The perfect way her inner walls clenched around him, showing that she wanted him inside of her.“Godric, you are so fucking tight, Addy.” Charlie muttered, another groan escaping his lips. He hated to admit it, but it had been quite some time since he had gotten laid. She felt so amazing that Charlie had to bite down on his bottom lip to try to control himself. The last thing he wanted to do was to underperform the first time he has sex with Adelaide.Adelaide continued writhing on top of Charlie, trying to take every inch of him that she could as she began letting her hands roam down his arms and chest, around his waist and up his back. She was taking in every part of his body she could reach with her hands. Her head fell to the crook of his neck, and she squeezed her eyes shut, trying to remember that she was bouncing on top of Charlie – not Sirius.Charlie halted her hips, pulling her up and off his lap as he stood up. His hands slipped along her bare shoulders as he spun them away so that she was facing away from him. He tugged down the zipper of her dress, roughly pulling the material from her body, stepping back with a satisfied smirk as the dress pooled around her ankles.Adelaide glanced over her bare shoulder at him, chewing on her bottom lip.“Are you going to fuck me now?”Charlie rushed forward, grabbing her hips from behind and shoved her down to the bed. If Adelaide wanted him to be rough, then he could do that. He would do just about anything for her – and that didn’t stop just because they were in the bedroom now.“Whatever you want, Adelaide. I’m yours.” Charlie told her, reaching down to position her just how he wanted her on the edge of the bed. He could see the blush creeping up her cheeks and instantly he leaned down to run his tongue along her backside before playfully squeezing both cheeks in his large hands.“You’re beautiful. Don’t ever feel ashamed. You have no idea how long I’ve been wondering about how you would look on my bed like this.” Charlie whispered huskily, his hands roaming down the backs of her thighs before he ran one hand up her back, pressing her upper body into the mattress as he held her hips up in the air with his other hand.Adelaide let Charlie manipulate her body how he wanted. She wanted him to take control because she was slowly starting to feel her grief bubbling its way back up in her chest. She wasn’t going to respond to him. Sure, she was a bit selfish, but she didn’t want him to think that this was anything but a consensual fuck between friends.At the sudden feeling of him entering her, roughly, from behind, Adelaide let out a soft gasp and gripped the sheets tightly. Her eyes shot open as she felt him reach her depths at a whole new angle. Her legs were already beginning to shake as her hips were propped up in the air, being held in place by his large, rough hands.This was what she needed. This perfect, rough release. Her back arched slightly as she, against her better judgement, glanced behind her shoulder and made eye contact with Charlie as his hips began pounding into her at a faster, much more relentless rate. She had no idea how he fit inside of her the way that he did. She felt him in ways she didn’t even know was possible.“I want you to come all over me, Adelaide. Do you hear me?”Adelaide whimpered at the harshness behind his words. She didn’t peg Charlie for being this demanding, especially in the bedroom, but the way his fingertips pressed into her hips, most likely leaving bruises behind, sent electric shocks throughout her entire body. She could feel the tight ball of nerves in her lower abdomen begin to spread out. She couldn’t believe she was going to orgasm like this.She still refused to respond. Atleast with words. She let out a low moan as she began moving her hips back more, meeting his relentless pumping before she slipped one hand between her legs to begin rubbing slow, methodical circles against her clit.“That’s it. Come on, Addy. Come. I know you want to.” Charlie let out a guttural grown as he moved one hand from her hip to the small of her back, pressing down against her.It was like a switch went off in her head, Adelaide felt herself clench down tightly around Charlie’s cock as she reached her high. She let out a soft cry, her head falling into the mattress beneath her as she orgasmed around Charlie.As he felt her begin to spasm around his cock, the feeling was enough to send him over the edge. And that was exactly what happened. His grip tightened on her hips, keeping up with the rough pace of pumping his hips as he felt himself reach his own orgasm, spilling himself deep within her walls. He continued moving but the rhythm was becoming slow, and his hands ran along her thighs and then made their way up her back.He was still relishing in the euphoric high that was slowly settling down over him. He took in a deep breath and pulled out from between her legs and instantly reached for his wand to perform a quick scourgify on both himself and on Adelaide.Adelaide remained quiet. After being cleaned up, she reached down to grab her underwear and tug it back on over her hips. She glanced, quickly, at Charlie while his back was turned to her. Biting down on her bottom lip she found her pajamas and dressed herself before finding her way to the bathroom.Charlie watched out of the corner of his eye and instantly felt a wave of dread wash over him. Why was she being distant? He found himself wanting to kiss her lips again and tell her that he would always be there for her. He wanted to tell her how much that all just meant to him, even if it was just raw, animalistically rough sex.He found himself getting underneath the sheets and falling fast asleep while he waited for Adelaide to return from the bathroom.

Upon feeling the sunlight stream through the window of the early morning hours, Adelaide rolled over in the bed and let out a soft sigh. Prior to falling asleep, she had paced back and forth in the bathroom in hopes that she'd waste enough time for Charlie to fall asleep. This was solely for the purpose of not wanting to drunkenly talk about what had just happened with them.She felt like she betrayed Sirius – even though he was dead and physically no longer on this earth – Adelaide felt sick to her stomach that she did something wrong. She could barely sleep and felt the weight of her actions pulling her further and further down. Into what, she wasn't sure.Charlie started shifting in the bed and at the knowledge that he was now awake, Adelaide began nervously chewing on her bottom lip. She had slept in the second bed, not wanting to push the wrong agenda with Charlie after having sex with him."Addy?"Charlie was sitting up now, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he realized Adelaide was sitting on the bed opposite of him."What are you doing over there? Did you sleep over there?"Adelaide couldn't help but feel bad at the sadness and confusion in his voice. She sucked in a deep breath and stood up so she could walk over and sit next to him. This entire time she had stayed silent, and she was nervously fidgeting with the hem of her sleep shirt. "Charlie, look..."Charlie reached over and grabbed her hands. Pulling her fingertips from her shirt, he held them tightly and kept them situated in her lap. "Let me speak first, ok?"Adelaide didn't want to let him speak. She knew that he would make this so much harder than it had to be. "Charlie, maybe that's not just a good idea." She admitted, shaking her head as she finally looked up and caught his gaze."Last night," Charlie ignored her pleas. He needed to get this out before he chickened out. "It meant a lot to me, Adelaide. I know things between us have been strained these past few years, but I need to be honest with you and with myself." Charlie smiled softly, leaning his head down just a bit so he could try to look at her once she started turning away from him."Charlie, stop." Adelaide pulled her hands from him. She stood up and began pacing back and forth again. "Last night was a mistake. I should have never... Godric, I threw myself at you and I was drunk and," she trailed off, trying to find the right words to say to him. She needed to soften the blow as much as possible but as she looked up and spotted the expression on his face, she realized she was much too late for that. "You know that I care for you, Charlie. I really do. Our friendship means so much to me and I don't want to ruin it.""How was last night a mistake, Adelaide? We love each other, right? I know you love me just as much as I love you." Charlie pushed himself to stand now, arms crossing taut across his chest."Charlie, I don't understand where all of this is coming from. You left me. All those years ago, and without a single word, mind you!" Adelaide began raising her voice, though quickly turned away from him to stare out the window. She was trying so hard to control her emotions and remain calm throughout this conversation. But with each word escaping his lips, Charlie was making it exceedingly harder and harder."It was a mistake. Last night, Charlie, what happened between us should have never happened." Adelaide continued, wrapping her arms around herself as she took in a deep breath. At this point she was beginning to sound like a broken record. But with his constant pleading, she had a feeling that he wasn't getting it. He wasn't understanding what she was telling him. She hated that. She hated the fact that she would have to be aggressive and mean."Adelaide, come on." Charlie moved to stand behind her now. He reached forward and tentatively rested his hands on her upper arms. He was afraid that she would slip away from him again. He didn't want to risk that. But maybe...maybe it was already too late for that, too."Sirius is barely dead." She was in full-blown manic mode now. She turned around and stared up at Charlie with tears in her eyes. She couldn't help but feel dirty at each passing glance and touch that Charlie gave her. "Charlie, don't you understand me? The man that I love is dead and I just fucked someone to feel better. No, you know what, not just anyone. My best friend. I fucked my best friend." She sobbed, now falling back into the cushioned window nook, covering her face with both hands."So that's all we did last night? Just an unimportant fuck between two best friends?" Charlie snapped, his eyes narrowing as he stared down at her."You're taking things out of context, Charlie. But you're right about one thing, I do love you. But I'm not in love with you... not anymore. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry that last night meant something to you." She whispered through the tears. Her hands were beginning to tremble as she continued covering her face. She was embarrassed and upset, but she was also angry at the way Charlie was reacting."I can't believe this." Charlie scoffed, rubbing at his face as he tried to figure out what this would mean for them now. "I just..." he trailed off, unsure of what to say next. He could feel the immense sadness surrounding the possibility that he had ruined his friendship with Adelaide again. "How could last night have meant so much to me and so little to you? I'm not understanding this, Addy. Please enlighten me."Charlie was angry, and in a sense it was understandable. His face was almost as red as his hair as he stared down at Adelaide. He knew her better than she knew herself – or atleast he'd like to think he did."Bloody hell, Ads, I was inside of you." Charlie blurted out incredulously, his hands now shot up in the air as he let out a humorless laugh.Adelaide felt as though she could barely breath at this point. The tears, the sobs wracking her small frame, the thoughts running through her head plaguing her with the worry of a ruined friendship. She looked up and saw that she was not the only one crying now. Charlie had tears streaming from his bloodshot eyes and she instantly felt sick."Charlie, stop, please." Adelaide was beginning to beg him at this point. "Please just stop."Charlie ran his fingers through his hair in a back-and-forth motion. The curled strands stuck up every which way as he pulled at the roots purely out of frustration. Without another word, he spun around and rushed from the room. He needed air. He needed to get out of there because he felt as though he was about to suffocate at any given moment.As Adelaide stared at Charlie's back as he retreated from the room, she stayed still apart from the sobs that continued escaping her. There was no way she would be able to see anyone in this house. Charlie had slammed the door on his way, and most likely made a scene as he stomped down the stairs. So, for the time being she sat as still as could be, her eyes trained onto the door while she listened for any tell tale sign that someone was lingering in the hallway.Once a few minutes had passed by, and Charlie did not return, she stood up and grabbed her things before walking out of the bedroom as quietly, and slowly, as possible. She had been hoping that Molly had gotten the kids out of the house to take them to Diagon Alley. She found herself feeling slightly bummed out that she couldn't go and visit Fred and George at their joke shop, but she knew she would make it another time.Once she was in the living room, Adelaide made a beeline for the fireplace so she could get the hell out of the burrow without causing anymore of a scene than she did with Charlie a few minutes prior.She heard the shuffling of feet behind her and turned to see who it was. Charlie stood in the doorway with his arms crossed over his chest."Where are you going?" he called after her.Adelaide felt the invisible tug at her heart as she heard the sadness that was apparent in his voice. "We both need to cool off. I'm going to go home. And, uh, maybe we can talk later tonight." She offered with a sigh. She knew, deep down, she wouldn't want to talk with him later. She didn't want to even look at him. She didn't want to relive last night.No matter what she said or did, she could not deny the fact that last night had felt good. But it was a mistake. Larger than she had originally thought.Charlie stayed silent, watching Adelaide continue her path to the fireplace. He knew better than to believe her when she suggested that they talk later. She wasn't going home, atleast not right away. She was most likely going to see Tonks.So then with a burst of green flames, Adelaide was no longer standing in the burrow. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ "So," Remus cleared his throat as he glanced up at Adelaide over the rim of his teacup. "Tonks shouldn't be too much longer."For the exhausted lycanthrope, it was a shock to see Adelaide burst through his fireplace so early in the morning. Even more shocking that she looked as disheveled as she did, not to mention the tears actively streaming down her cheeks.She hadn't said much at all. And he knew she was there to speak with Tonks, and not him – and he was ok with that. He had an inkling that it was not about Sirius, or atleast not completely about him. Three months had gone by, and he still felt the profound loss of one of his oldest and dearest friends. He could only imagine how Adelaide was feeling, how she was getting by. Her life had changed drastically in the blink of an eye and that was not easy to deal with."Thank you, Remus." Adelaide whispered out, wrapping her fingers around the delicate teacup so she could strictly enjoy the warmth it provided. As her foot tapped nervously against the old hardwood floor beneath the table, Adelaide finally lifted the cup and took a slow sip."I slept with Charlie and now I'm panicking."Remus coughed slightly, the hot tea rushing down his throat as he tried to regain his composure. "Oh?""Remus, I don't know what to do. We were both slightly drunk after Bill and Fleur's engagement party. And I don't know why I did it because I knew what I was doing was wrong. And it's obvious to me now that Charlie knew what we were doing, too, but in his eyes it wasn't wrong." Adelaide sat the cup down and wiped beneath her cheeks with the pads of her thumbs to stop the tears from rolling down her entire face. "I feel dirty." She sat back and looked up at her friend.Remus sighed softly. He reached over, once setting his teacup down, and let his hands rest gently over hers. "Deep breaths for me, Adelaide. It will be ok. Everything will be fine."Adelaide forced a weak smile. She gave Remus a nod and closed her eyes so she could work on controlling her breathing. She didn't want to get all worked up again. She hated the feeling. First, the chills usually spread throughout her entire body which was usually followed by a lightheadedness that sent her into a dizzy spell."You shouldn't feel dirty." Remus began. He took in a deep breath before continuing. He knew he needed to be careful with how he approached this. "It's in our nature to have and enjoy sex. And it can be hard to bridge the gap of misunderstanding between two people when sex is involved.""That's an understatement, Remus!" Adelaide cried out with a groan. "I-I just needed to feel something. It was wrong of me. I knew that I should not have pursued that with Charlie because he would become, how should I put it," she paused with a sigh, "Emotionally invested.""Is that what happened?" Remus questioned."Yes. I told him that it was a mistake and he told me the complete bloody opposite!" Adelaide sighed, sinking further into the chair as she began chewing on her bottom lip. "I feel as though I've betrayed Sirius." She spoke softly, barely above a whisper, as she began to nervously play with the ends of her hair. "Did I betray him, Remus? Please be honest with me."Remus sighed. "I will be honest with you when I tell you that Sirius had his concerns about your relationship with Charlie.""Bloody fucking hell! I'm a horrible person. I knew it!" Adelaide exclaimed."Now, stop. Let me finish." Remus stood up and walked over to the desk in the corner of the room. Adelaide watched him as he began rummaging through the top drawer. It didn't take him long to pull out an envelope. Immediately, the color drained from Adelaide's face. She sat up straight, eagerly watching Remus walk back over to her."This is from Sirius." Remus told her, handing her the envelope. "He knew you were faithful to him. He never doubted that. I hope you know that, Adelaide. But Sirius is gone now. And he wanted you to be happy. To be loved and protected.""It's too soon." She told Remus, holding the envelope tightly in her hand before she started pulling it apart to get to the letter. "But thank you, Remus. Truly." She smiled up at him for a moment before glancing back down at the envelope in her hands."I'll give you some privacy." Remus leaned down to place a gentle kiss on the top of her head before he scooped up his tea and walked out of the kitchen.Adelaide kept her eyes shut after Remus left the room. She wasn't sure why she was feeling nervous so suddenly. Maybe it was because she knew this letter would make her even more emotional. Sirius had been gone for over three months and this had been something he sat down and thought out for her before anything had happened. Did he know that he would lose his life in this war?The healer couldn't help but feel a pang of anger at this. It was ridiculous, really. The last emotion she should be feeling when it came to Sirius Black was anger.After a few more minutes of sitting with her eyes closed, listening to the sounds of her own breathing mixed with the low shuffling of Remus' feet in the other room, Adelaide pulled out the letter and unfolded slowly."Adelaide,

If you're reading this, love, that means I'm gone. Life is never perfect. Of all the people in the world, I know that more than anyone else. Though, I would like to think that what we had was pretty bloody great. I can't see the future so I don't know what, or who, took me from you, but you must go on. I've lived too many years in this world without knowing what the real love of a woman was, atleast until I met you. Every day since, you have surprised me in more ways than one.

I want you to be happy. I don't know how long it will take for you to stop being so stubborn and agree with me (though, love, let's be honest, I was always right). And don't roll those beautiful baby blues, either, though if I know you as well as I think I do, you are doing just that right about now as you're reading this."Adelaide let out a sob. Her hand covered her mouth to stop anymore noise from escaping. She had just rolled her eyes. Even from the grave, Sirius knew how she would react. She felt sadness swell deep within and it took her another minute or two of wiping at her cheeks to continue with reading his letter."You deserve nothing more than everything the world can offer you. I trust you knew that leading up to my departure, as I trust that you will live your life knowing that you will someday find love again. Though he may not be as dashingly good looking as I was, whoever the man is that you so chose to marry, that's ok. You'll learn to live with it, I'm sure.

I love you, Adelaide Corden.

Always yours,

Sirius Orion Black III"Adelaide wasn't sure what to expect when she opened this letter. Now, though, after reading it – it was everything she should have assumed Sirius would say. The letter was not heavy with emotions, it was simply just so perfectly Sirius.Twirling the ring that hung around her neck in between her fingers, Adelaide let out a soft sigh. She re-read the letter a handful of times before she heard a soft knock at the doorway behind her. Turning to look over her shoulder, Adelaide forced a smile at her best friend who stood beside Remus."Wotcher Addy! I heard you have quite the story for me." 

After reliving the events of the prior night with as much detail as possible per Tonks request, Adelaide stared up at her friend. For someone who was always rather mouthy, Tonks was uncharacteristically quiet. It made Adelaide feel slightly unnerved."Well?" Adelaide breathed out, "What are you thinking? Am I a horrible person? Merlin, that's it. You think I'm a horrible person."Tonks shook her head and reached forward to grab onto Adelaide's hands. "No. Relax. You're not a horrible person, Adelaide. You're human. I'm not mad at you, I don't think any less of you. I promise."Remus stood off to the side of the table, putting together a tray of tea and biscuits – which was really all he had left in his kitchen for the time being. Without speaking, Remus set the tray down before the two women before he slipped from the room."I feel like I've betrayed Sirius, though. Is that normal? I mean," Adelaide smiled up at Remus as a silent thank you before she prepared her tea the way she liked it. "Honestly, I guess I really don't know what to think or feel. I just know that I messed up. Like royally messed up.""Are you just saying that because it was with Charlie?" Tonks questioned, shoving a biscuit into her mouth, and began to chew loudly before washing it down with the tea.Adelaide sat back and took a moment to think about the question Tonks had posed. Was it just because it was Charlie? Would she have felt this way if she went out and slept with someone she didn't know? Maybe... Maybe not. She wasn't sure."Tonks, I don't think it's that's simple." Adelaide chewed on her bottom lip, "But maybe you're right. Maybe I feel this way because it was Charlie. I mean, bloody hell, Remus told me Sirius didn't trust him all that much and what the hell do I do the moment Sirius is dead? I fuck my best friend.""I thought I was your best friend?"Glaring, albeit playfully, at her friend, Adelaide let out a soft laugh. "Stop!" she nudged her for a moment before she took another sip of her tea."Well, I've got another question for you. And it's not an easy one." Tonks licked her lips and shifted back to look at Adelaide. "Do you still have feelings for Charlie?""Yes." Adelaide replied bluntly. She was mentally hitting herself now as she leaned forward and let her forehead hit the kitchen table. "I mean no." She stuttered just a bit, "I mean, I don't know." Her eyes were filling up with tears again and she leaned back and covered her face with both hands. "I'm a horrible person. I used him, Tonks. My feelings for Charlie aside, if I was in my right mind, I would not have acted on them. Last night, I was strictly acting under the pressure of wanting to feel anything but this intense weight of grief. This grief follows me wherever I go. Every time I close my eyes, I see Sirius slipping away from me."She was beginning to cry again and only quieted down when Tonks wrapped her arms around her frame, hugging her."Adelaide, nobody is angry at you. I mean, I know that we're the only ones who know that this happened. But Remus does not think any different of you and neither do I." Tonks told her, a small smile forming on her lips as she rubbed Adelaide's arm before pulling away."I just know that I'm not in any way ready to pursue something romantic. With Charlie, with anyone really." Adelaide shook her head, finishing her tea before cleaning up after herself."Well, there is only one thing left for you to do then." Tonks sighed out, "You've got to talk with Charlie." ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ Adelaide, instead of returning home, ended up back in the burrow. Once she stepped out of the fireplace and brushed herself off, she glanced around and noticed the house was still empty.As she took a quick look at the clock poised high on the wall to her left, she could see that Charlie was around here somewhere while his parents and siblings were either at the joke shop or at Kings Cross boarding the Hogwarts Express.After setting her things down by the couch, Adelaide wandered through the kitchen and out the half door. She walked across the grounds surrounding the multiple story home and without even thinking of where she wanted to go, her feet brought her to the lake. The lake held a special place in her heart, and she knew that Charlie felt the same.They had plenty of happy memories from the summers they spent with one another growing up. As she neared the spot where the grass turned to sand, Adelaide found herself wrapping the thin sweater tighter around her frame. The cooler weather was approaching fast, and the healer found herself wanting to get further and further away from it all.Charlie was sitting with his legs pulled up to his chest, his back towards Adelaide as she walked closer to him. Her footsteps were quiet as she approached him and without announcing herself, she took a seat beside him.Surprisingly, the silence between them was comforting."I'm sorry that I left the way that I did."Charlie looked up at the sound of Adelaide's voice. He gave her a nod in response but chose not to say anything yet."Charlie, listen," Adelaide sighed. "I never intended to hurt you. You must believe me." She scooted herself closer to Charlie, turning more to the side so she could look at him as she spoke. "I care about you and our friendship. Last night was a moment of weakness, Charlie. For three months I've had this dark cloud floating above my head. Following me everywhere that I go. Weighing me down so much that it feels like I'm walking with lead layered in my shoes."Charlie turned around now, his eyes taking in Adelaide's face as she spoke to him. He could see her eyes filling with tears as she began delving into the grief she felt. He felt selfish, as well, though. He wanted her to feel the same way he did about last night. It was selfish of him to wish such a thing for someone in so much pain."I don't want to lose you." Adelaide reached over and tentatively placed a hand on Charlie's arm. "Please, I cannot lose you again."Charlie did all he could to ignore the goosebumps raised on his arm at her touch."Please don't leave me. I can't afford to lose any more people in my life." Adelaide choked out, tears now streaming down her cheeks as she pulled her hand away from Charlie's arm to now rest limply in her lap."Don't cry." Charlie finally spoke, a soft sigh escaped his lips as he scooted himself closer. He grabbed her hands and held onto them tightly. "You're not going to lose me. I promise, Addy, I swear it." Charlie brought her into his side, hugging her tightly."Last night should have never happened. I should have stopped you... I should have stopped myself. But I'm a selfish man, Adelaide." Charlie sighed, pressing his lips against the top of her head.Charlie knew it to be true. He was entirely selfish. He wasn't worried about the sadness that was obvious in her eyes even as he entered her. He wasn't worried about the moment Adelaide told him she wanted him to hurt her. That was not like the Adelaide he knew."We both made a mistake. We can get past it, can't we?""We can try." Charlie smiled weakly as he pulled back to look down at Adelaide, who was already staring up at him with wide eyes filled with tears. "We can try."Adelaide started crying again, resting her head down against Charlie's chest as they hugged one another. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ D E C E M B E R 1996The cold weather brought upon a lot of change. Adelaide submerged herself in her work. She was still dealing with the immense pain and grief over the loss of Sirius – but she was getting better. It had been six months since he passed, and Adelaide found herself slowly getting back into a normal routine. Atleast as normal as possible with what was going on in the wizarding world around them.She met with Tonks and Remus often. Although it pained her to see them together at times, Adelaide was happy for her best friend finally finding love. And if it was possible – Remus was even more deserving of the newfound happiness.Although she had come to an understanding with Charlie, they had decided to not spend as much time together. It hurt at first, but only for the first few weeks. Adelaide missed him but knew that after sleeping with him for pure selfish reasons, the distance between them was needed.She wasn't sure how she got so lucky, but she had only worked the night before into the morning of Christmas, so she was able to spend the night with her parents for dinner before taking the floo to the burrow. She had promised Ginny she would come and spend some girl time with her since Hermione was not spending Christmas with the Weasleys.Adelaide was delightfully surprised when she walked out of the fireplace and spotted Harry, Remus, and Tonks sitting with Arthur."I can almost feel the tension in this room, you know." She laughed; a brow raised high in the air as she finished brushing any soot leftover on her clothes."Wotcher Addy. Happy Christmas!" Tonks got up to greet her friend quickly, "Bit of a serious conversation here."Adelaide hugged Tonks in return and nodded in understanding. "Well then let me get out of your hair. We'll talk later. Happy Christmas everyone!"The blonde walked over to the kitchen, greeting Molly with a surprise hug from behind. This caused a loud gasp to escape the Weasley matriarch's lips followed by a laugh. "Adelaide Corden!" Molly playfully swatted her with the towel she was using as oven mitts to transfer a warm dessert tray from the oven to the table."Charlie's upstairs with Ginny and the twins. And Ronald is, well, he's around here somewhere." Molly offered."Glad to hear the twins came for Christmas. I was beginning to think they've let the success of that joke shop get to their heads." Adelaide teased, a smirk appearing on her lips before she removed her coat and scarf to set on one the many hooks for such things. Adelaide then ventured up the many winding steps to join the Weasley siblings.Molly stood by the base of the stairs, wiping her hands off on the towel with a soft, sad smile on her lips. She was relieved to see the same spark of fire returning to Adelaide's eyes. It was slowly beginning to replace the sadness that had plagued the young woman for the last six months."Happy Christmas!" Ginny exclaimed as soon as she saw Adelaide open the door to the room they were all situated in. The young red head jumped up, pushing through Fred and George to burst into Adelaide's arms. Pulling back from the hug, Adelaide smiled down at her before greeting everyone else.Charlie, who had gotten up from his spot by the window, was last. She wrapped her arms around him in a quick hug, pecking his cheek softly. "Happy Christmas, Charles Weasley.""Happy Christmas, Adelaide Corden." Charlie chuckled softly, pinching her arm playfully before they all sat back down. Charlie explained the game that they were playing, but Adelaide chose to sit this one out and instead opted to sit by the window to look at a photo album.Fred and George were the first ones to leave after the game was finished. Soon it was just Charlie, Ginny, and Adelaide."I wonder what Harry is doing." Ginny sighed, quickly covering her mouth as she realized she had voiced this thought out loud and not just in her head.With a grin, Adelaide shook her head. "He's probably downstairs with Tonks, Remus, and your parents still. Go save him from the boring conversation I'm sure they're still having." She urged the girl with a wink.With a blush rising quickly on her cheeks, Ginny forced herself to look everywhere but at her brother who was staring at her with a look of disgust. It was obvious that he did not like seeing his little sister growing up."How was dinner with your parents?"Charlie stood from his spot on the floor, cleaning up the mess his siblings left over before joining Adelaide at the window."It was nice. Quiet, as it always is. You know how they are." Adelaide shrugged and glanced up at Charlie with a weak smile before she focused her attention back to the photo album. She was looking down at the pages filled with photos from the first summer she met Charlie and his family."We were so little." She sighed as she brushed her fingertips along the edges of the photo. This one was one of her favorites – it was the summer after their first year, and she spent almost every weekend there with Charlie. She couldn't help but laugh as she watched twelve-year-old Charlie throw Fred up in the air while she was sprawled out on the grass with George.Charlie peered over at the photograph with a laugh. "That was a fun summer." He mused with a smile."It was." Adelaide agreed, closing the album before looking back out the window. She let out a slow breath, watching how it fogged up the window. She reached up and wiped at the window to clear her field of vision. At that exact moment, she saw a rather large ball of fire fall past the house."That's not one of the twins' products." Charlie stood up instantly and Adelaide did the same.They stood there for a moment side by side, silently waiting to see or hear something that would tell them that Charlie was wrong and that it was one of the products from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. But as Adelaide leaned closer to the window, she saw the fire spread out, forming a circle around the entirety of the burrow.A familiar and eerie cackle sounded off in the air. Immediately, Adelaide felt her side to make sure her wand was there before she rushed out of the room, down the stairs and straight through the front door bypassing Tonks, Remus, Molly, and Arthur."Addy, no! Get back here!" Charlie cried out, turning to grab his wand before he started to run after her. He knew what she was going to do, and he was not about to stand around and let it happen. He wouldn't be able to live with himself if she got hurt, or worse.Adelaide tuned out the pleas of everyone who stood at the front door. She had just spotted Harry rush through the fire, most likely having the same idea as her – which was to chase Bellatrix Lestrange and kill her. Atleast that was the only thing running through her mind right now. Her hands were trembling, and she could already feel sweat beading up around her forehead.Ginny started rushing forward to get through the flames, calling after Harry. Adelaide could tell she was terrified but willing to run after the boy. It reminded her of herself."Ginny!" she grabbed the girls arm and pulled her back. "Don't. I'll go."With that, Adelaide found herself leaping through the fire after Harry once she was able to use her wand to pull some of the flames back before letting her feet do all the work. She chased after the sound of footprints not thinking about, or knowing, who she was chasing after."Bloody hell!" Charlie shouted, raking his fingers through his hair before he started towards the flames."Charlie, no. Wait. It's important that we formulate a plan. We can't just chase after them. We have no idea how many of them came here tonight!" Tonks tried to speak reason to her friend, grabbing onto his shoulder to keep him in place."She's right, Charlie." Molly cried, wiping at her cheeks to remove the tears that were leaking from her eyes.The matriarch was beginning to think that it was too much to ask for a simple, safe, and happy Christmas holiday. 

"Harry!" Adelaide screamed as loud as she could to try and find the boy who ran after Bellatrix. She was breathing heavily as she stood in the ankle-deep freezing cold water. She was beginning to feel the adrenaline flow through her veins, the feeling of pins and needles taking over her hands and fingertips as she began to get a read on her surroundings. It was dark and cold. The water was splashing up against her legs and soaking through her trousers as she waded through, turning as she went to look all around."Harry!" She called out again, her hand gripping her wand tightly. Where could he have gotten to so quickly? She continued through the reeds, water still sloshing around her feet as she went. She could hear nothing but the sound of her own breathing, as well as the pounding of her heart. She stopped by a small little mound of ground and raised her wand up in the air."Lumos." The tip of her wand lit up, helping her see but only a few feet ahead of her. There was someone standing between the reeds and with a few rapid blinks, Adelaide started moving backwards. Whoever was standing in front of her – it was not Harry.The man wore a sick and twisted grin, and with the skin that wasn't covered with his tattered clothes, she could see thick scars – those like the ones Remus wears. She had never seen this man before, atleast not in person. His wanted posters, though, had been strewn around Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade for years. She had also heard enough about him from both Sirius and Remus."Hello love." Fenrir Greyback licked his lips as he continued forward. Each step he took forward, Adelaide should have taken one back. But she didn't. She couldn't.Adelaide felt frozen in time. It was as though her feet were stuck in mud, or something thicker, like concrete. The hand that held her wand up at eye-level was beginning to tremble and before she could shoot off a defensive spell, Fenrir rushed forward to grab onto her."Impedimenta!"Harry stepped up quickly, rushing through the reeds and water to step infront of Adelaide. His wand was raised high, hand steady as can be - casting the spell to slow Fenrir down as Adelaide snapped to her senses and grabbed onto Harry's hand."Expelliarmus!" Adelaide was now pointing her want towards the werewolf, her eyes wide with fear and anger as she heard Bellatrix splashing around them, repeating over and over "I killed Sirius Black!"She felt every nerve within her alight with something ferocious. Something she had not felt since that wretched night in June. Turning around, she spotted Charlie and his father, Arthur, rush through the reeds which finally pushed Fenrir back a bit further as he joined Bellatrix.Adelaide made sure to maintain her focus. Once she was able to do so, she was able to figure out that it was just Bellatrix and Fenrir, and no other Death Eater was here. She felt Charlie stand behind her, his back pressing into her as his continued blasting off protection spells around them."Hello darling! Long time no see!" Bellatrix chortled, waving her fingers in a greeting as Adelaide made eye contact with her."Don't you speak to her!"Adelaide looked up to Charlie as she heard his voice booming above her head. She thought that no matter what, she would always feel terrified at the thought of facing off against Bellatrix Lestrange. With Charlie in her corner, though, she felt safe. That same terrified feeling from before seemed to have disappeared and she reached down with her free hand to grab onto his tightly. This was her silent way of thanking him.A few more hexes were thrown around, the group of four against two in constant movement until it seemed as though they were called away by some unknown force. Though it really wasn't unknown. They came to do what Lord Voldemort wanted them to do. They were no longer needed here. They disappeared in clouds of black, shooting up in the sky and away from the burrow.Adelaide took in a deep breath, not even thinking about the fact that her hand was still tightly fastened with Charlie's. At this moment, his grasp on her was the only thing keeping her from freaking out."Are they gone?" Harry asked, looking around and squinting to see better in the dark."I'm not sure." Arthur shook his head, though turned quickly as he heard a loud wail coming from behind them. "Molly!" he called, realizing that it was coming from the direction of the house.As they all rushed forward, following Arthur back to the house. Adelaide kept herself close to Charlie. She could sense that he was refusing to let go and the healer couldn't help but think to herself that his hand felt nice wrapped around hers.As they made it through the water and the tall reeds, Harry stood next to Ginny, Arthur going to Molly, and Remus rushing to Tonks.Adelaide stayed beside Charlie, holding tight to his hand as her eyes became wide at what was standing before them. The burrow, the home that housed all seven rowdy Weasley children, was now completely up in flames. She stared up at the house as it burned. Memories of the good times, and even the bad, spent underneath that roof running through her mind as she stared into the flames."Did everyone get out?" she started looking around, finding Ron and the twins behind their parents before letting out the breath she had been holding out of fear. Everyone was accounted for, but Adelaide still could not shake the sick feeling in the pit of her stomach. What was the reason for this? Why did they attack? It was almost like a scare tactic. Ruining everything the Weasley family had just because they could. Unfortunately for them, they did not know the Weasley family. From the ashes of their home, they would rise and be stronger than before. Molly was one of the strongest woman Adelaide had ever met."Are you ok?" she heard Charlie whisper down to her, giving her hand a squeeze before he pulled back from her. At the loss of warmth and protection his hand had provided her, Adelaide turned to look at him."I'm ok, Charlie. Just shaken up a bit, I guess." Adelaide shook her head and tucked stray strands of hair behind her ears. "Why was it just the two of them? What do you think they want?""That's a question that we will figure out at another time." Remus spoke up, his arm wrapped around Tonks' waist, keeping her close to his side. "Let's get this fire put out first."Arthur was consoling his wife, gentle hands running along her back and shoulders to reel her in and press a gentle kiss against her forehead. "I love you, sweetheart. It will be ok."Adelaide was heart broken that this happened to Molly and Arthur, to the whole Weasley family. She had turned around, sending a patronus to her parents to let them know what had happened and that the Weasleys', and Harry, would be coming to stay with them for a little while. Once she turned back around the group was already putting out the flames.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ Once they all got to the Corden home, Adelaide helped everyone get comfortable before she joined Charlie in the kitchen."I see you've found my father's firewhiskey stash." Adelaide let out a soft laugh as she watched Charlie down the glass quickly before pouring more.He waved his wand and summoned another glass, looking expectantly up at Adelaide. She silently accepted and moved to sit across from him before taking the glass of liquor from him."He's been keeping it in the same spot since we were eleven, Addy. He's got to step up his game." Charlie forced a laugh, swirling the glass of amber liquid around before taking another sip. The liquor burned going down and Charlie couldn't help but wince, just a bit, as he swallowed."Well, for starters, we're not children anymore. So, he doesn't really have anyone to hide it from." Adelaide smiled softly as she looked up at Charlie. It was hard to sit here and act like this was a normal Christmas night. Or even just a normal night in general.Adelaide was terrified that this would be the new normal. She could not, and did not want to, imagine a life where they had to fear dark wizards appearing out of nowhere to set their homes on fire. Adelaide had muggle-born friends at work who were absolutely terrified of coming to work anymore. It broke her heart that they had to worry about whether they would be murdered simply for the fact that one of their parents was a muggle.Her heart broke for Remus – who was living a life of solitude solely for the fact that he had been bitten by Fenrir Greyback as a child."Thank you for opening up your home to my family, Addy." Charlie spoke up after a few minutes of silence had gone by. He was finished the second glass of alcohol already and was pouring yet another when Adelaide reached out and slipped her hand onto his."We are family, Charlie. You know that, right?""Yeah, I suppose we are."Adelaide kept her hand on his and smiled when he turned the back of his hand against the table so she could lace her fingers with his.This was the most intimacy they had shown one another since the night of Bill and Fleur's engagement party.Adelaide wanted to deny the feeling his hand in hers gave her. It had been a while since she felt those butterflies. Even though it had been six months since Sirius was killed – it was only six months. For some, that may be a long time. For others, not so much. And although she was better, mentally, Adelaide still was not ready to move on. Not by any means.Adelaide removed her hand slowly, letting her fingernails drag the palm of his hand before she picked up her glass and finished up the drink. "Ron and Harry are in my dad's study. I was able to transfigure his little sofa into three beds. You remember which room that is, right?" She got up and took both glasses from the table, placing them in the sink before going back over to take the bottle of firewhiskey, put the lid back on, and set it back down in her father's hiding spot – the spice cabinet beside the oven. Not a very good hiding spot, but the man would never change."Second door on the right?"Adelaide smiled back at Charlie. "That's the one." She told him with a nod. "Try to get some rest."Charlie nodded, walking out of the kitchen, and pausing by the doorway to turn around and speak once more, "Happy Christmas, Addy.""Happy Christmas Charlie." She called back after him, giving him a little wave before she watched him climb the stairs.There is nothing happy about this Christmas, Adelaide thought to herself.She cleaned up the kitchen and soon found herself lying awake next to Ginny who was tossing and turning in her sleep. Adelaide rolled onto her side, the Black family ring still hanging around her neck and now off to the side as she moved her body.She brought the ring up to eye level, staring at it in the moonlight provided by her bedroom window. She pressed the cold metal to her lips in a soft kiss before letting it fall back down."Happy Christmas, Sirius Black."◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ The next morning was a whirlwind of emotions. Adele and Molly were cuddled on the couch, Adelaide's mother providing comfort to Molly as much as she possibly could. Faustus and Arthur were in the kitchen, eating the meal that both of their wives had prepared earlier in the morning.Fred and George were back at their flat above the shop, which left Ron, Harry, and Ginny. Adelaide felt bad that the rest of their Christmas holiday would be helping rebuild the burrow, so she was already trying to come up with ideas on how to help them and keep them entertained. She knew they were basically adults at this point, but she still felt a bit responsible for them.She was finishing up cleaning up the flatware in the kitchen before she heard the floo roar to life. She dried her hands on the nearest towel before folding it and placing it back on the countertop. She walked into the living room and smiled upon seeing Remus and Tonks brushing themselves off."How'd you sleep?" Tonks asked Adelaide as she gave her a hug."Well, to be honest, I've had better nights but I've also had worse nights." The blonde tucked hair behind her ears before she moved to greet Remus next."What about the two of you?" she sat down on the armchair as Remus and Tonks took the couch."Well, I think it's safe to say we all have a lot on our minds." Remus chuckled a bit, his arm slipping around Tonks' shoulders as he brought her in closer to his side. Tonks smiled up at Remus, her hand finding his knee and providing a reassuring squeeze."Hey, when did you two get here?" Charlie entered the room, shaking Remus' free hand before playfully rubbing Tonks' hair in a teasing manner. Tonks pushed his hand away giving him a playful glare."Only a few moments ago." Remus replied with a smile."Speaking of having a lot on our minds," Tonks cleared her throat, a blush creeping onto her cheeks as she turned over to Adelaide."Remus and I are getting married!"

D E C E M B E R 1996 “Do you think this is too much?”“What? Too much? Tonks, most women would barely consider this a wedding dress.”Adelaide stood behind the chair Tonks was currently fidgeting away in. The shade of her hair was consistently changing with each passing thought or worry. The dress she was wearing was a deep purple – which Adelaide knew was one of her favorite colors. Tonks usually drifted to darker colors, where as Adelaide was the complete opposite. Unless she was wearing her dark Ravenclaw blue, she could usually be found in bright, or light neutral, tones.“I’m just a bit miffed.” Tonks sighed again. “Mum wanted me to wear her dress.” A look of confusion, and maybe a bit of fear, washed over her features.“Well, white was never your color.” Adelaide smirked, reaching down to toy with a single strand of her friend’s hair that was now a deep shade of purple – almost matching perfectly with the dress. Even after all these years, she was still mesmerized when the color changed right before her very eyes.“Thanks Addy.” Tonks laughed softly before she stood up. She finally decided on the fact that what Remus saw was what he was going to get. They had known each other for a while now – they were getting married for Merlin’s sakes – and Remus knew what he was signing up for.She was a mess. He was a mess. Together, they would be one big, beautiful mess.Adelaide could not be happier for her friends. Her heart swelled within the confines of her chest as she watched Tonks pace by the door. Her nervousness was adorable. Tonks was never nervous. It was almost unbelievable that Remus J. Lupin was the only person alive to bring on this kind of behavior in the metamorphaghus.Everything was set up in her parents’ home. The ceremony was short, sweet, and small. They chose to not have a big theatrical event – with the rise of Voldemort happening – and fast, they did not want to bring any more attention to themselves. To The Order.Remus, who was only a few doors down, had asked Harry to be his Best Man. They wanted him to be a part of everything before he went back to school. New Year’s Eve was the perfect wedding date, according to Andromeda. The older woman was excited to welcome everyone into her home for the special occasion.Adelaide, when Tonks had asked, didn’t even have to think of her answer before wrapping her arms around her best friend in agreement to be her Maid of Honor.Adelaide had found herself standing off to the side holding in her sobs as she watched the way that Remus lovingly looked down at Tonks as they exchanged their vows. She could have sworn that she saw Harry have a small twinkle in his eyes, as well. That would be something she would have to tease him about later.Once the ceremony was over, Andromeda had made sure that there would be enough food and drink for everyone. The Weasleys were all present and after dinner was finished, Adelaide found herself gravitating towards Charlie.“Can you believe Tonks is the first one of us to get married?” Adelaide joked with a smirk, plopping down onto the couch besides Charlie.Looking up with a laugh, Charlie shook his head. “Honestly, no. Pinch me, am I dreaming?”Adelaide giggled, leaning over to playfully pinch Charlie’s arm. “She makes a beautiful bride. Truly, a vision in purple.” The blonde leaned over against the arm of the couch, lifting her glass of firewhiskey to take a small sip.Charlie grinned. “Yes, she is. I’m glad she’s happy… one of us deserves to be.” A soft sigh escaped his lips as he glanced over at Adelaide before letting his eyes land back on the newly wedded couple who were still swaying together on the makeshift dance floor Mrs. Tonks had created.Although his statement hurt, Adelaide knew he was right. She was still miserable – maybe a bit more than what was normal, especially after they had slept with one another.“Adelaide, would you care to dance?”Looking up, Adelaide raised a brow at Harry who was standing there, awkwardly shifting his weight from side to side.Charlie watched the two with a small grin. Harry was a good kid. Charlie knew that he had been there to protect Adelaide when he couldn’t and for that, he would be eternally grateful. Charlie was beginning to feel a bit hopeless at the thought that he couldn’t even keep the promise he had made to Sirius.“Of course, Harry. I’d be honored. Though, Hermione told me you weren’t too good on your feet at the Yule Ball. I hope your skills have gotten better.” She teased, a soft laugh escaping her lips as she stood up, finished her drink, and handed Charlie the empty glass with a smirk.The redhead took the glass without question, leaning back to watch Adelaide walk around and begin to dance with Harry.“Y-You know, I’ve been meaning to talk to you.” Harry whispered to Adelaide. His hand felt a bit clammy in hers – but she chalked that up to him being nervous. Nervous for what though, she wasn’t sure.“Hm?” Adelaide looked over at him with a reassuring smile. Her eyes twinkled with a hint of amusement, not sure where this was heading. “Is everything ok?”“Oh, yes, of course.” Harry nodded. “Everything is fine. I just wanted to say that I-I wish things were different.”Adelaide frowned. Now she knew where this was going. With another sigh, Adelaide gave Harry’s hand that was in hers a squeeze. “I know, Harry. I wish things were different, too. I miss him. And I’m sure you do, too.”Harry smiled in silence. A nod was all she needed from him, so that was what she got.“And he was so bloody proud of you.” Adelaide continued, nudging him a bit as they continued their dance. “You know that, right?”“Yeah, I know.” Harry smiled again.Adelaide followed Harry’s train of sight to a certain redhead. “You know, I’ll keep her brothers at bay if you want to ask her to dance.”Harry blushed. He had thought he was being incognito with his staring. It appears he was not successful.“Are you sure?”“Oh, yes. I’ve been wrangling my fair share of Weasleys for a very long time. You go. Ask her.”Adelaide let go, stepping back from Harry with a grin. She chewed on her bottom lip as she watched Harry walk to Ginny and ask her to dance.Both teenagers were blushing furiously – it was cute.Adelaide found her way over to Fred and George, seeing the hint of mischief in their eyes.“Don’t even think about it. Leave them be. Just for tonight, ok?”Fred sighed, looking up at Adelaide for a moment before looking over at George.“I won’t hex Harry if you dance with me.” George beamed.“George Weasley.” Adelaide laughed, shaking her head. “You’ve got some nerve. Using my answer as leverage. That’s not fair.”“Well, yes or no?” Fred asked, patting his brother on the back. “Georgie here needs to learn how to dance with a woman.”“Yeah! A real woman!”Charlie was refilling his glass of firewhiskey when he overhead this. He couldn’t help but let out a snort, followed by laughter. “You two are ridiculous, you know that?” He shook his head, pouring another glass to hand over to Adelaide. “And if you keep acting like that, you will never know what it’s like to dance with a real woman.”Adelaide couldn’t help but blush. She knew that being called a real woman was nothing special. A woman was a woman, and just that. She wasn’t extraordinary – atleast she didn’t consider herself to be.Fred smirked, “Better luck next time Georgie. Maybe we can get her at Bill and Fleur’s wedding!”George sighed. “Charlie just wants her all to himself. Don’t worry big brother, I won’t take your woman.”Now it was Charlie’s turn to blush. Adelaide ignored the insinuation, reaching over to playfully smack both Fred and George before she took the glass from Charlie and turned back around to face the rest of the room.“Boys will be boys. Even though they’re of age now, I’ll always see them as the two little menaces who never let me sit down during my trips to the burrow.” Adelaide laughed softly, chewing back on her bottom lip again.Charlie stayed silent for a moment or so. If he were going to be honest with Adelaide, he had not stopped thinking about the night they had sex back in August. He knew he had been the one to ruin things between them in the beginning. He had done his fair share of apologizing. He had done his fair share of working for forgiveness from his best friend.Granted, he had been extremely childish when he realized how serious her relationship with Sirius Black had been. Again, he had to remind himself that he had left her and not the other way around. His chest caved in at the memory of being told how hard she took his leaving. He had to hear it all from someone in his family – she had ignored his owls for a very long time after all.He would never assume that she would be able to move on so easily after her boyfriend was murdered right before her eyes. Charlie wanted to be there for her but since that momentous night in August, he was finding it to be increasingly hard to think platonically. Adelaide had told him that sleeping with him was a mistake and that she was just using him to feel better.Charlie had not been with anyone since his short stint with Aoife. And even then, it had been purely physical. There was no real connection. Not like the one he had with Adelaide, anyway.Even though he never spoke a word of it – Adelaide was his person. Charlie knew that since they were eleven and she had smiled her toothy grin up at him when he needed a place to sit on the Hogwarts Express.If he needed to wait longer… he would. And really, the more he thought about it – maybe the longer the wait the better.“Hugo wants me to come back to Romania.”Smooth. A nice way to break the ice, Charlie thought to himself. He mentally slapped himself as he turned to look down at her.“What?” Adelaide turned to stare back up at him. “You’re going to go back there? Now?”Charlie shrugged. “I mean, I haven’t given him an answer. Not yet anyway. I needed to talk with Dumbledore. There are more foreign wizards he wants me to meet with.”Adelaide nodded. She had no claim over him, or his life. She knew that. Turning away and trying to tamp down the uneasiness she was feeling at the idea of no longer having Charlie close to her, Adelaide drank the rest of the firewhiskey before setting the glass down on the table beside them.“Well, I can’t stop you. And… I guess if Dumbledore thinks it’s important for you to do this, then you should go.”Charlie forced a smile. Adelaide was always the one who tried to be the voice of reason. And he knew that she was right. He felt honored that Dumbledore would bestow this great duty upon his shoulders. It meant he was a trusted member of The Order. That was important to him.“The thing is…I would have to leave tomorrow.” Charlie cleared his throat. “And I don’t know how long I would be gone this time.”Adelaide glanced over at him. She was trying to ignore the heaviness in her chest, but it was becoming increasingly harder to do so as she stared up into Charlie’s hazel eyes. They were warm and kind, just like his mother’s.“Well, if it makes you feel any better about your decision to go,” Adelaide began before she cleared her throat and tried to play off the fact that she was quickly swiping beneath her eyes to brush away any tears that dared to slip out.“I promise to answer your owls this time around.”

J A N U A R Y 1997Adelaide meant every word she had spoken to Charlie the night before. She would answer his owls – though she was still upset that he was choosing to return to Romania. What if she needed him? Really, it was a silly though… a ridiculous worry that she just could not help but feel. Deep down, she knew she shouldn’t need or want him – but she still did. She had also promised to keep an eye on his parents, Molly specifically.The attack on the burrow by Bellatrix and Fenrir took Molly’s morale down a couple of notches. Although she would never admit it openly, Molly was struggling. She was scared, and Charlie had almost declined Dumbledore’s offer but ended up talking it over with his parents before making his decision.It was only mid-morning but all of those still attending Hogwarts were on their way back to school. Adelaide, who had gone home alone, was about to make her journey back to the burrow when she was disturbed by the loud screech of an older brown owl hovering about her kitchen window.Tossing the floo powder back into the little cauldron against the wall, Adelaide turned and let the owl in. “My, my, what have we here?” the blonde giggled softly as the owl let out a soft noise at her gentle touch as he rested his claws gently on the curve of her fingers.She had seen this owl before, but as she took the letter from the creature and before she could inspect him, he flew back out the window and headed in the same direction he had come from. “You didn’t even wait for a treat!” the healer found herself calling after the typically nocturnal creature before shaking her head at the realization that she was now yelling at animals who couldn’t talk back. Maybe she was finally losing her mind.Unraveling the small piece of parchment, Adelaide read the contents three times over. Before she started to think about what she was reading. Why on earth would Dumbledore offer her a position at Hogwarts for the remainder of the school year? Glancing quickly at the clock on the wall to her left, she realized she only had another hour of Charlie’s time and would want his guidance on the matter.Folding the letter back up, she turned on her heel and dashed back over to the fireplace. She grabbed the powder and tossed it down before stepping in and calling out for the burrow.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇“I wonder why Dumbledore waited until the last possible moment to ask this of you?” Molly stood beside her husband, who had just returned from watching the kids board the Hogwarts Express back to school.Arthur looked at the letter again before handing it over to Charlie who held his hand out to read it once more.“I’m not sure. Dumbledore always has a reason for the things he does as well as the things he says.” Adelaide shrugged her shoulders, pulling a part of the freshly baked cinnamon roll on the plate infront of her to pop a piece into her mouth and chew silently. Mulling over the possible reasons, Adelaide continued to chew and stare down at the plate.Maybe it was just to help continue to keep her busy. She would have more to do at Hogwarts than at St. Mungos. Atleast that is what Adelaide believed to be the case anyway. “I do miss Poppy, too.” Adelaide laughed softly, licking her fingertip to rid it from sweet cream that was melting on top of the cinnamon bun.Charlie found himself watching his friend from across the table. He had to shift himself around beneath the table as discreetly as possible. Godric the things this woman does to me, Charlie thought to himself as he cleared his throat and folded the letter back up to slide over the table to Adelaide.“I think I’m going to accept. And after all, he’s got connections with someone at the top of the board at the hospital. It looks like I’m already good for a transfer, atleast for the just the rest of the school year.”Charlie nodded. “It will certainly keep you busy.” He chuckled at thinking of how often he had quidditch injuries while back at school.Adelaide always escorted him from the stands to the infirmary and even though Madame Pomfrey was the one in charge, Adelaide always found herself tittering about his bedside to make sure everything was taken care of. She always did what she could to make sure he was comfortable and safe. And now, as a fully-fledged adult, he was wondering why it had taken him so long to come to terms with his feelings for his best friend.“I’m sure.” Adelaide laughed softly, finishing up the cinnamon bun before she stood and helped Molly clean up the dishes.It wasn’t much longer before she knew she had to head back home to tell her parents what her plans were, and to pack up what she would need in these next nearly six months.Molly and Arthur had excused themselves elsewhere, which left her alone in the living room with Charlie. They were silent for a while, enjoying each other’s mere presence until Adelaide heard Charlie clear his throat. She blinked a few times to bring herself back to reality and dropped the Black family ring, that was still hanging loosely around her neck, back underneath her shirt as she turned to look at the second eldest Weasley.“I think we should talk before we head our separate ways.” Charlie spoke tentatively at first. He was nervous, of course, which was only natural. He had wanted to talk with Adelaide about the night they slept with one another but knew that she wasn’t ready to do so. Atleast she had not been ready the last time he tried to bridge that conversation with her.Dread filled her almost instantly. She didn’t want to talk about it. Not yet. Maybe not ever.“Must we really?” she sighed softly, fidgeting with the sleeve of her shirt to try and occupy her mind. Right now – she wanted to think about anything and everything but the way Charlie made her feel when they were intimate. Honestly, the whole thing was rushed and not really intimate at all. It was rough. Primal, even. At the memory of Charlie perched behind her, holding her down and in place with his rough hands, caused a blush to begin spreading it’s way across her cheeks.Charlie sighed in return. “Yes, Addy, we must.”“Alright, well, go on then.” The blonde crossed her arms over her chest as she had turned into the arm of the couch so she could face him.Charlie ran his fingers through his hair, scratching at his scalp as he went. The feeling was soothing to him, and he couldn’t understand why he was now feeling nervous when he had been the one to try and initiate the discussion.“Well,” he forced out a laugh, “In all honesty I did not think I’d get even this far so I’m trying to gather my thoughts right now.” He admitted.Adelaide forced a smile. “Charlie, maybe it will be best if we don’t talk about it.” She shifted against the couch, leaning forward as she gently placed a hand on his arm. “It’s not serious, yeah? I mean, we’re okay. We’re not fighting…we’re friends. I think it’s perfectly natural for friends to go through awkward stages after they’ve done things that they regret.”Charlie rolled his eyes and grabbed onto her hand. “But here’s the thing, Addy… I don’t regret it. I’ve told you that already.” He held onto her hand tightly, knowing she would most likely try to pull away and get out of the conversation.Adelaide stayed quiet. She was really hoping that her face was not portraying the sudden swirl of emotions she was feeling. Her chest was beginning to feel tight, and she could almost sense that her palms were becoming sweaty with how on edge her nerves were. With gentle ease, she pulled her hand from Charlie’s and placed it in her lap. “Charlie, I don’t know what you want me to say. I’m just not… I’m not ready.”It was so hard for him to not get angry. He could feel the heat within him finally start to reach his face and he moved to stand up with a grunt. “Are you ever going to be ready, Addy? You’ve been saying this since the morning after. Bloody hell, I’m feeling like we’re just going to continue dancing in these circles around what happened. It’s not fair to me.”“What’s not fair is that you feel like I owe you any kind of explanation.” Adelaide snapped, pushing herself up now as she placed her hands on her hips. “You men are all the same.” She found herself muttering beneath her breath. She kept her eyes trained on the floor, focusing on the way he was shuffling his feet. Charlie could never stay still.“I can’t just keep waiting around.” Charlie told her, his arms now moving to cross tightly over his chest.With that, Adelaide looked up with wide eyes. “Waiting…around?” she guffawed, “You’ve got to bloody kidding me, Charlie! I spent practically seven years waiting around for you.” She stepped forward, hands still resting on her hips as she narrowed her eyes at him. “And you didn’t seem to mind. You left me in the middle of the night to wake up in your bed. Alone.”Charlie looked down out of shame. He knew he hurt her. He knew that – but seven years? Why didn’t she ever say anything to him? It just didn’t make sense.“Why did it take for you to have some liquid courage to tell me how you felt on our last night at Hogwarts?”“Do you really have to ask me that? I was just a kid, Charlie. And we were best friends. The three of us… I had to think of the integrity of our friendship.” Adelaide told him with a shrug. It wasn’t an excuse as she was trying to be as authentic as possible.“I can’t help but laugh because I didn’t want to ruin anything, but it seems like there was no way of getting around that.” She spoke up again, tucking her wavy tresses behind her ears.“You didn’t ruin anything between us. I did that when I left without telling you I was leaving.” Charlie stepped closer and let out a breath as he looked down at her. After a moment of silence, Adelaide finally lifted her head to look up at him. Her eyes were wet, tears fighting to remain locked away, to not spill over and run down her cheeks. She didn’t want to show Charlie just how upset she really was about this all.All she could think about was Sirius. About how she had betrayed him. Was betraying him. She still loved him. She would always love him.“This doesn’t change your mind about still writing to me in Romania, does it?”Adelaide could not help but laugh. Even now, even after she snapped at him and refused to talk about that night back in August, he was trying to make her laugh.“You know me better than I know myself, Charlie. I don’t go back on my word. I’ll answer your bloody letters this time around.” The blonde laughed through the years, wiping at her cheeks roughly with her thumbs to brush away the wetness before she cleared her throat and looked towards the fireplace.“Just checking.” Charlie smirked.“I should get going.” Adelaide spoke up with a small smile. She stepped forward and gently pressed her hand against Charlie’s cheek. His eyes bore into hers and she found herself feeling warm all over. His eyes were different than Sirius’. They were still warm and loving, yes, but there was something else in them. Something that made her feel protected.Now, Sirius also made her feel safe. But somehow, somewhere deep down, she knew that it was a different type of protection with Charlie than it was with Sirius.“Yeah, I know. I’ve got about fifteen minutes before I need to take my portkey to the sanctuary.” Charlie agreed with a nod. He reached up and grabbed her hand as it still rested against his cheek. He gave it a tight squeeze before he pressed a kiss to her open palm.“Goodbye Charlie.” Adelaide whispered up to him. She took her hand back from his so she could grab a handful of floo powder before she tossed it into the fireplace and stepped in, glancing back at the tall redhead who had not moved from his spot before she was engulfed in the green flames and transported to her very own living room.Charlie stood there with a sad smile. Watching his best friend leave and not knowing when the next time he would see her again would be was painful.In all honesty, Charlie was beginning to remember why he had left her all those years ago without a goodbye.

M A Y 1997Just as she had promised, Adelaide answered Charlie's correspondence. They wrote to one another once a week and she was grateful that he was not daft enough to try and mention having another conversation about what happened between them.She knew it was too good to be true. Bill and Fleur were getting married in three months and she knew that Charlie would atleast come home for that – if he wasn't home prior to the nuptials – and he would try to talk to her again. Especially with some liquid courage of his own.The letters were kept light and short. Checking in as friends normally do – nothing serious was ever discussed. Adelaide and Charlie both knew that there was that slight possibility that their letters could fall into the wrong hands.Being able to attend Hogsmeade outings each weekend was a nice getaway for the healer. She enjoyed the time spent with Madame Pomfrey and other colleagues, but what was even better was getting to see Tonks for lunch.Married life seemed to have been treating the metamorphagus well. Adelaide could see that her best friend was glowing and she had no doubt that Remus was treating her the way that she deserved.When Charlie had joked about the students keeping her busy – that was no joke. There had, as always, been weird occurrences happening throughout the school and Adelaide was constantly reading and working with Poppy to figure out the best course of action.Poor Katie Bell, for starters. She had unfortunately come into contact with some kind of cursed necklace. Now this had happened prior to Christmas and the new year, so Adelaide had not been around when it happened, but she was still doing her best to treat Katie and get her back to full health."Healer Corden, may I have a word?"At the sudden intrusion to her thoughts, which were keeping Adelaide pressed against the stone wall in the courtyard, eyes falling on the sun that was shining brightly above them."Of course, Professor. You need not ask." Adelaide smiled up at Dumbledore as he stood beside her.She could see his frail hand hiding beneath the large sleeves of his robes. She had tried numerous times to get him to open up about it but he would quickly dismiss her concerns with a 'I'm quite fine, my dear.' and move on to whatever he wanted to discuss next."It has been some time since we've spoken on a personal level." Dumbledore began, a sad twinkle in his eye. "I wanted to offer you my condolences about Sirius. He was a great man, a great friend, and a great wizard."At this point, Adelaide was glad he did not mention that Sirius was a 'great lover' on top of everything else. For a moment, it almost looked as though he would. But he cleared his throat and started strolling down the corridor, beckoning for her to follow.She wasn't sure why he was offering her condolences now. It was almost one year since Sirius had fallen into the veil. Almost one whole year without the man she thought she would spend the rest of her life with.Walking with the headmaster in silence, Adelaide kept her hands clasped behind her back as they were now behind the walls of the school."Poppy has told me that Katie is almost back to her usual self and that you had a lot to do with her recovery. I have to say I am not surprised in the least," the older man began to speak once more, "I am grateful that you so graciously accepted the position, Ms. Corden. ""I enjoy being able to walk these halls without worrying about Tonks saying something outrageous to land us both in a detention with Professor Snape." Adelaide teased, a smirk forming on her lips as she glanced up at Dumbledore.The headmaster let out a gentle chuckle, his eyes twinkling with a bit of mischief now. "Ah, yes, Nymphadora was always the one to say something out of line. Though, from what I remember, it was all harmless."Adelaide nodded."Thank you for humoring an old man, Adelaide." Dumbledore let the hand he had been working so hard to hide come into the light now. He rested it her forearm with a nod. "Enjoy the rest of your day."And with that, he was gone.What a strange, strange man...◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ Adelaide was beyond ecstatic when Katie Bell was deemed healthy enough to return to school. She made sure to walk the girl to the Great Hall, smiling wide as she gave Ginny, Harry, Ron, and Hermione a gentle wave through the masses before turning on her heel to head back to the infirmary.She had not been in there long before she found herself wanting to head to the owlery to see if Charlie had responded to her latest letter. She had feeling reliant on his correspondence, but the truth of the matter is that she missed him something fierce.Now, she would vehemently deny this if anyone asked, of course. But once she made it and gathered the letters she had, she found herself giggling like a schoolgirl as she walked the halls reading over Charlie's latest adventure.He had written that he got into a slight scuffle with Hugo about whether he planned on staying for good and knowing that was even a possibility made Adelaide's heart sink further down her chest, almost falling into her stomach and causing her to heave up what she had last eaten."MURDER!"

"MURDER IN THE BATHROOM!"Well, that certainly brought Adelaide back to reality. She blinked a few times, turning around in a full circle to try and gauge where the screaming was coming from. She could tell that the screaming was not from a student, per se, but from Moaning Myrtle instead.She tucked the letter safely in the pockets of her robes before she dashed through the empty corridor to the bathroom that she knew Myrtle inhabited.By the time she had gotten to the bathroom, she ran into Severus who dashed in before her. Honestly, the potions master basically shoved her aside as he whipped his wand out and rushed to the body that was bleeding out in the middle of the room.The water was shooting up from the multiple sinks that were no doubt blasted off with whatever spells the two boys had shouted at one another.Her eyes were wide as she walked up behind Harry, her hands reaching out and although they were trembling out of fear, she clutched onto him firmly. Severus was kneeling besides the other boy, who Adelaide recognized as Draco Malfoy, whispering the same incantation over and over again.The healer watched as the water, which was running red with the Slytherin's blood, cleared up. The blood reentered Draco's body and the wounds that Harry had inflicted upon him were closing."What did you do?" Adelaide hissed, turning Harry so she could get a better look at him.For only a moment did the healer feel worried – the look on Harry's face screamed that he was terrified of what he had just done."Adelaide."The nasally voice brought her out of her thoughts, turning to face Severus as he nodded to Draco who was passed out on the floor. "I've healed the wounds, but he still needs to be brought to the infirmary.""I'll go on ahead and get the bed prepared for him." Adelaide nodded, knowing that this was what Severus was asking of her.As she stepped out of the room with one final look back at Harry, Adelaide let out a deep sigh. This was not like the Harry Potter she knew. The boy standing behind her was being so reckless. She hated thinking it, but she knew Sirius would be so disappointed in him.She rushed through the corridor back to the infirmary, ignoring the fact that she heard Severus grab at Harry and snap at him about the spell he used against the Malfoy boy. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ Although the boy lying beside her was most likely following in his Father's footsteps, Adelaide did what she could to make him as comfortable as possible.Severus was right when he said the healing spell he had used was really all that was needed. Adelaide had removed Draco's shirt to make sure he had no other wounds or blood that needed to be before dressing him in clothing that Severus had gotten from the boy's dormitory.The following day she found herself lingering around his bedside again. He was awake and had remained quiet for most of the day. His friends had attempted to check in on him – he refused their company."Draco," Adelaide began softly, moving to pour him a glass of water before she looked down at him. "If you need someone to talk to, you can talk to me."The blonde remained silent for a moment. His eyes dark as an expression full of pain washed over him. He turned his head slightly, eyes narrowing as he looked at her."I've no need for any kind of help from a filthy blood traitor like you." He finally spat out at her."Well, if you change your mind, I'll be here."Adelaide wished she was shocked at the disgusting tone of his voice, but the truth of the matter was that Draco Malfoy was truly the product of his environment. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ J U N E 1997Leaning over the desk in her living quarters, Adelaide read over the letter she had just penned to Charlie. She didn't want to sound too clingy – but she let him know that she missed him and that she had hoped to see him before the day of his brothers wedding.She had rewritten the bloody thing three times over now and decided on folding it in three sections, tucking it away in the envelope and heading off to the owlery before she lost her confidence.It was the end of the school year and Adelaide knew she would not be returning to Hogwarts next year. She took her time, once she sent off the letter to Charlie, in walking the halls. She stopped by to say hello to a few students and some of the professors. She felt light on her feet as she found her way into the library. Happy.This had once been one of her favorite places when she was a student here. It was empty right now, which was no surprise to her. She found herself lost in a large potions book. Page after page of knowledge that she had memorized years prior was still interesting to her. She had been so lost in what she had been doing that she did not even realize that it was getting later into the night. Closing the book with caution, Adelaide put it back in its rightful spot and left the library behind her."Oh, shoot," Adelaide muttered, looking at the nearest window to spot the dark sky above. She had gotten so lost in her love of books that she had forgotten that she told Tonks she would meet her before the night had ended. Adelaide had been busy as of late, and Tonks had only just joined the rest of the members of the Order in their watch of the castle.She rushed through the hallways, up the stairs and found herself nearing the 7th floor since she knew Tonks would be up that way. She stopped dead in her tracks as she came face to face with Neville, Ron, and Ginny."Gin?" Adelaide cleared her throat, her eyebrow raised high as she watched the three students whirl around, hands gripping their wands tightly."What the bloody hell are you three doing out here?" she walked closer to them and looked around, noticing that the rest of the corridor was empty. "Where is the order? Tonks and Bill should be up here."Ginny rushed over to Adelaide and explained everything that Harry had told them. Adelaide was unsure of how to feel, but she knew that she needed to go find Bill and Tonks. "I'll be right back." The blonde held tightly onto Ginny's arm before she looked up at Neville. "Neville, keep your eyes open and pay attention. At the first sight of anything wrong, I think you need to run."Neville nodded in understanding. He had always been timid, but he wanted to be able to prove himself. This was the opportune moment for him to do just that."And Ronald." She turned to the redhead, nudging him slightly. "Where is Harry?"Ron shook his head. He wasn't sure, completely, where Harry had run off to, but he knew that he was safe and with Dumbledore.Adelaide rushed by, glancing back over her shoulder before turning around again to look for Bill and Tonks. Luckily, the duo was right around the corner, and she did not have to go far to find them."Why are Neville, Luna, and your little sister hanging around the corridor preparing for a fight?" Her question was directed at Bill as she shoved a finger into his chest. "They are too young to be involved in any of this!"Bill groaned at the sudden intrusion, looking over at Tonks who had only shrugged her shoulders in response."We can't get them to leave, Addy." Tonks spoke up, a small sigh escaped her lips as she began walking back towards the trio around the corner."Tonks is right, Adelaide. I've tried. I know you're not foolish enough to think I'd let my little sister be in harms way."Adelaide sighed, rubbing at her face out of frustration. She knew that. Of course she knew that. She knew Bill would rather lose his own life than ever put Ginny, or any of his siblings, in harms way. "I'm sorry. I guess I just... growing up as an only child was tough and when I met your brother and the rest of you Weasley's..." her voice trailed off and she could not believe she was beginning to get emotional. She wasn't quite sure what had come over here, but once Bill wrapped her up in a hug, she soon got control of herself."Sorry, don't know what came over me." She laughed as she pulled away, wiping at her cheeks before turning around to head back in the direction she had come from."Missing a certain redhead? And before you say anything, it's obviously not me because, well, here I am!" Bill smirked."Bill!" Adelaide cried, pushing him playfully. "I'm not dignifying that with a response."Bill was laughing and as they turned the corner, he turned away to look ahead at the exact moment the flames on the wall were extinguished. Darkness flooded the corridor and he reached down to grab onto Adelaide's hand."Stay behind me. You have your wand?" he hissed down at her. The darkness had spread fast and even though they were side by side, he could not see where she was."Yes!" Adelaide told him, "I have my wand."Adelaide knew what terror felt like. She could feel herself pale, her fingers tightly wrapped around her wand as she tried to will the memories of Sirius falling into the veil out of her mind. The darkness wrapped around them, but throughout the darkness she could see flashes of light – most likely spells being shot from the wands of those around her.She hated the fact that Bill was right. Especially right about now. She was missing Charlie. Terribly. Not that she needed him for protection. She could handle herself for the most part. But with someone having set off something, most likely Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder now that she took a moment to think about it, it was hard to feel confidence in her ability to protect herself and those around her.  

Adelaide felt sudden bursts of energy as she kept her mind open. Although she could not see right infront of her – she knew someone was getting closer and closer to her. She could hear the heavy breathing and snickers leaving the person's lips and was quick to realize that whoever this person was – they were not on her side.But if Sirius Black had taught her anything, it was to never give up. To never surrender, even if victory did not seem close enough to grasp. She refused to go down without a fight. That was not the kind of person Sirius thought she was. He was not here to protect her, and neither was Charlie."Bombarda!"Adelaide was not sure where the voice came from, but she knew she was close to them as she had felt the blast of whatever wall had just come crumbling down. It must have been the same person who was lingering near her, snickering.Her body was thrown back against part of the wall that was not currently in the process of crumbling down. With a groan, Adelaide closed her eyes and tried to keep her wits about her. Luckily, she was not thrown back too hard and other than a sore back she was still conscious as she saw a dark figure towering over her.Before she could blink, the figure was thrown back and through the air. Her hand moved from its spot on the side of her head as she pressed it against the floor to try and leverage herself up."Bloody hell..." she groaned softly, flinching at the sudden pain shooting up her back as she moved to stand up again."You should probably take your time with that."The voice was familiar. Why was it so familiar?"Addy?" the figure spoke up again. This time, a large hand gently wrapped itself around her upper arm. The stability of another person helping her stand was all she needed to finally open her eyes.It was not as easy to ignore the pain but when the figure spoke again, Adelaide felt something entirely else course through her veins. The hand wrapped around her arm was beginning to shake her to her very core."Charlie?"Her voice came out hoarse as she leaned into his touch. Was she hallucinating? She had to be hallucinating. How in the world could Charlie be here so fast? Maybe she got knocked out in the blast and was dreaming of Charlie saving her? She used to imagine him as her knight in shining armor after all. So that had to be it. Yes, she must be dreaming."Adelaide, can you hear me?"After another hand grasped her other arm and shook her slightly, Adelaide squeezed her eyes shut. The person holding onto her was right infront of her, but she was terrified of opening her eyes and looking up at someone who was not a friendly."Adelaide!""What's wrong with her?" Another voice spoke up."I think she's in shock. She was thrown into the wall. She's not bleeding from what I can see."Adelaide felt the hands fall away but soon her face was being pressed into something hard. It was a chest, she could feel the outline of familiar muscles against her cheek. The smell invading her nose was familiar too. Smoke – but not the smoke from a cigarette.Smoke from fire. Fire from the mouth of a dragon."Charlie?" she spoke up again.Blue eyes fluttered back open as she felt hands slip against her cheeks, tilting her head back at a slight angle."It's me."Adelaide stared up at the only Weasley she had been missing.This wasn't a dream. She was awake and alive and was in the arms of her best friend."You saved me." Tears were beginning to form in her eyes as she began to blink to push the warm, salty liquid out of her line of vision before she grabbed onto Charlie's hands that were still on her face. "You saved me." She repeated, a soft sob escaping her lips as she stared up into Charlie's eyes.She thought she was stronger than being reduced to a sobbing mess after being thrown into a wall. This scared her. Maybe she wasn't strong enough to make it through this war. Maybe she wouldn't survive this. She would be no help to those around her. Those negative thoughts she fought so hard to remove from her head were starting to creep back up.She was the reason Sirius was dead. She distracted him and all it took was that one moment. That one single moment that his eyes moved from his opponents to Adelaide's and that was his downfall. She was his downfall.Charlie wiped her tears away, quickly looking over his shoulder. The fight was still going on, but it seemed to be moving further and further away from where they stood. That made Charlie feel a little uneasy but at this moment, what was going on around him was not important. What was important was Adelaide.He turned back to look down at her and forced a small smile upon his lips."I received a patronus about the attack while I was working with a new ridgeback at the sanctuary. Honestly at this point I don't even remember who sent it. All I knew was that I needed to get back here. Get back to you." Charlie whispered. Even with the sounds of fighting around them, he refused to take his eyes from her.They stayed tangled up in one another for what seemed like eternity. Adelaide drowned out the noise around her and she was certain Charlie was doing the same. "For me?" she whispered softly, pressing her cheek into his hand with another sob. "I'm not worth it, Charlie. I'm not."Charlie sighed. His hands moved from her face as he wrapped his arms around her, bringing her in tight against his chest, Charlie pressed his lips against her forehead. "That's not true." He told her firmly. "You are worth it. And so much more. I'm not the only one who feels this way."Adelaide slipped her arms around Charlie's waist, holding herself up against him as she gained control over her breathing. She was getting ready to speak when they heard shouts from the end of the corridor. It sounded a lot like Tonks and the two instantly pulled apart to investigate further.

◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇

Dumbledore was dead. Albus Dumbledore was dead. And Severus Snape had killed him.As Adelaide stood over Bill Weasley's sleeping frame in the corner of the infirmary, her mind was going a mile a minute thinking about what happened to make Severus do such a thing. She never saw, completely, eye to eye with Hogwarts headmaster but that still didn't mean she wanted to see the man killed in the school he kept together throughout one war – not to mention the beginning of another one.And Severus... the man had a foul personality but there were times when she had began thinking that maybe underneath his metaphorical armor, he was good. Genuinely good. It was obvious now that she was wrong.She pressed her fingers, that were coated with a special ointment, into the already healed scars along his face. A soft sigh escaped her lips as she wiped her hands clean and turned to face the rest of those who were standing around.She was happy Bill was knocked unconscious and was still out because the bickering back and forth between Molly and Bill's future wife, Fleur, was starting to get to her."I'm not marrying your son out of vanity, Molly." Fleur hissed at the Weasley matriarch. Her thin arms tightly wound over her chest as she narrowed her eyes at her future Mother-In-Law. "I find offense in the fact that you think because he has some scars that he is no longer attractive."Fleur tore her attention from Molly to her sleeping fiancé in his hospital bed. To be frank, the scars made him even more handsome. He was a strong wizard. A warrior. And the loyalty to the cause and those around him was a turn on for her.Molly was about to open her mouth to fire back at Fleur before Charlie grabbed, in a gentle manner, onto her shoulder. The look on his face told his mother to be quiet and let the argument die. Luckily, Molly listened to her second eldest son before causing any further damage on the relationship with her soon to be daughter-in-law.Adelaide smiled weakly as she watched Billy start to wake, his parents and Fleur surrounding his bedside immediately."He's extremely lucky that Greyback wasn't completely transformed." Adelaide whispered to Charlie, leaning against the doorframe of Poppy's office.Charlie nodded in silent agreement. He knew his older brother was strong, both mentally and physically speaking. And now, watching him with Fleur sent his brain into overdrive. None of them knew what would happen next. Each day would be a challenge until Voldemort was dead."I know I told you that I missed you and couldn't wait to see you again... but I didn't think you would take it so literal." Adelaide grinned as she looked up at Charlie.Laughing, Charlie turned to face her as he leaned himself against the opposite side of the frame. "You know," he cleared his throat, "It's nice to hear you joke again."Adelaide smiled. Charlie was right. She felt a certain warm light coming from within and it had been so long since she had felt this way that she almost forgot how much she enjoyed the back-and-forth banter with Charlie. It was easy to forget the world when you were in the company of those who care and love you. Adelaide and Charlie stood side by side, talking with one another throughout the night until the sun began to rise in the east.

J U L Y 1997This summer started with disaster, just like the summer before it. Adelaide had struggled with the memory of that night in the Ministry. The look of peace in Sirius' eyes as he floated away from her, forever.After Dumbledore's funeral, Adelaide busied herself with working at St. Mungos. And when she wasn't working, she was dividing up her time between her parents, Charlie, Remus, and Tonks.Tonks. The metamorphaghus had just announced to her and Charlie that she was pregnant. Adelaide cried. She cried hard. She had been so happy for her best friend and Tonks was relieved in knowing that this baby was already so loved by everyone around his, or her, parents. The same night Tonks told them the good news, Adelaide was so excited and interested in hearing everything about the pregnancy that she stayed well past her welcome – Remus could be heard clearing his throat every few minutes from the hallway until she finally gathered her things and headed home.Currently, though, she was pacing the doorway of the burrow. They were all preparing to travel to Harry to move him from the Dursley's home to the Weasley's."Will you stop doing that?" Charlie groaned from his station in the living room. He looked up from the latest copy of the Daily Prophet before closing it and tossing it over to the coffee table."I can't help it. I'm worried. What if we should just move him tomorrow morning? Maybe they'll be less likely to attack. And after all, we don't know if they have a clue about when we're moving him...unless..." Adelaide began to think of Severus, though with a quick shake of her head, she pushed those thoughts out and turned to face Charlie. "Sorry, you know how I get when I'm worried."Charlie smiled. "Yes, I do. Now you should know to listen to me when I say you can relax. Everything will be ok. And I know you're a bit miffed that you're staying here but..." his voice trailed off for a moment as he tried to think of the right words to say. How could he tell her that it was important that she stay here, safe, and completely out of harm's way, so she could be prepared to heal those who arrived wounded?Charlie knew better than to think positive thoughts about this. In all honesty, he really was not looking forward to drinking the Polyjuice potion. He never tried it before but had talked to Ron and Hermione about it and judging by the way they described the taste; it would not be pleasant by any means."But you need me here to be ready to heal whoever is bloody dumb enough to get hurt?" She tried to tease, lightening the mood to the best of her ability.After Sirius died, Adelaide felt like her ability to be humorous had declined dramatically. It had only been fourteen months since he died but she thought she was making progress. Though – she still refused to speak with Charlie about that night at Bill and Fleur's engagement party.Time was a fickle thing. It moved slow, yet fast, and all at the same time. Adelaide still could not believe that it had already been over a year since she lost him. She also could not believe that Bill and Fleur were getting married in the next few days. The entire order was looking forward to this celebration of life and love. They needed the positive interaction. A night where nobody spoke of the dark lord unless they wanted to deal with the wrath of Fleur Delacour.Times were tough. The Death Eaters were getting more and more confident in their attacks on the public. Adelaide hated going to work just to find a new patient being admitted after being tortured and seriously injured for information the Dark Lord wanted. But the idea of having a celebration with those she loved sounded like a nice escape from their reality."Hopefully it's not me. I've got to look good for the wedding. Have to show the groom up, you know." Charlie teased back, running his fingers through his hair before he turned to look at his brothers who were preparing to head out.Adelaide sighed. "Charlie, you've met Fleur, yes?" she grinned, reaching forward to ruffle his hair immediately after he got done fixing it. The strands that were once lifted back from his forehead were hanging forward now. Adelaide liked when he didn't pull his hair back. Maybe it was just something she was attracted to – long, messy, and not to mention slightly curly hair.No, stop thinking about him."Ah yes... well, she'll understand. I mean, she's got to live with the fact that she's, unfortunately, not marrying the best looking Weasley." Charlie was smirking wide now, his eyes refusing to leave Adelaide's as she ruffled up his hair. He enjoyed the feeling of her being close to him. The way her fingernails, that were not too short or too long, rub against his scalp. It was quite calming. Chills shot down his spine and shook his shoulders in the slightest."Well, who told you that?" Adelaide questioned, a hint of mischief in her eyes. "I think Bill is quite fit."Charlie gasped, his hand moved to press against his chest, hovering above his heart, as he feigned shock. "I'm telling Fleur you fancy her husband, then."Adelaide giggled, playfully slapping him before she finally tore her gaze from him."I'm only teasing." He added quickly, the smirk still growing on his lips as he watched her cheeks turn red. In truth, he was hoping she'd give him a kiss – solely for good luck, of course. Judging by the stares coming from the remaining members of his family as they prepared themselves to leave the burrow, he knew that it wouldn't happen.He took his broom from the position it held against the wall and started towards the door after Fred and George."Charlie?" Adelaide reached forward and slipped her hand around his wrist. "Please. Be careful. A-and look out-""Look out for Harry, yes, I know." Charlie smiled down at Adelaide, shaking her hand from his wrist so he could lace their fingers together. "Don't worry, Addy. We'll be fine.""And Tonks, too." Adelaide whispered, leaning closer to him in hopes that nobody else would hear her. She knew that Remus and Tonks were going to tell everyone tonight about their bundle of joy but have not done so yet."Always." Charlie whispered back with a nod.Adelaide sighed softly. The last time she was left at home while everyone went on a mission, she went against what everyone told her and joined them. Because of this – Sirius was dead. She hated thinking that the death of her lover was the reason she learned her lesson, but it was the truth.While everyone was busy transfiguring themselves into Harry Potter tonight, Adelaide would keep watch of the burrow by Molly's side. And that was where she would stay. It was where she had to stay.Without so much as another breath, Adelaide reached up and pressed her lips against Charlie's cheek. She pulled away almost as fast as she had leaned in and gave him a soft smile. With that, Charlie headed out the door and into the night with the rest of the order. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ Hagrid and Harry arrived home first. Adelaide found herself pacing the foyer as Hagrid spoke with Molly. Every single noise she heard, she jumped and spun around to the field across from where she stood. She just wanted everyone to get back in one piece.She saw a flash out of the corner of her eye and quickly spotted Remus struggling to hold George up."Bloody hell!" she hissed, quickly rushing forward to help Remus bring the injured twin inside."What happened?" she turned to look at Remus in hopes he'd explain but the man had roughly grabbed onto Harry and was interrogating him. She knew Remus only had everyone's best interests at heart – they had to be careful. After all, they had no idea the lengths the dark lord would go to infiltrate the order – what lengths they would go just to get a chance to kill Harry.She sighed and turned immediately back around to George and Molly, already instructing the Weasley matriarch to get some damp rags as she pulled her wand out to try and heal his ear. The more she whispered under her breath, and the less his ear his healing, Adelaide did her best to not get frustrated."This must have been done with dark magic. It's not healing with the usual spells." Adelaide told Molly with a shake of her head. She knew better than to lie, or even stretch the truth, with Molly.Hermione and Kingsley arrived next. Adelaide did not even bother looking over her shoulder as she wiped at George's face with the wet cloth, brushing strands of hair from his forehead. She knew she wouldn't turn back around until she heard Charlie's voice. Proof that he made it home. Proof that he made it back home to her.Ron and Tonks made it back after that and Adelaide quickly glanced over to make sure Tonks was safe before tending back to George. A smile lingered on her lips as she caught a quick glimpse of Remus cradling Tonks in his arms, pressing his lips against her forehead. The healer assumed he was most likely whispering sweet nothings to her and their unborn child – she didn't blame him."Mum?"Charlie appeared in the doorway, rushing through the room to give Molly a hug before he looked down at George."Your brother and father still aren't back yet." Molly whispered with a hint of sadness in her voice. It was at that very moment that Arthur and Fred rushed through the group to the couch."What's wrong?" Fred spoke up before he saw George still laying with his eyes shut on the couch.Adelaide moved back and slipped her hand into the bend of Charlie's arm, looking up at him. "He'll be okay." She finally announced, though a breath she didn't realize she was holding was slowly escaping through her lips as she observed Fred watching over his brother with a look of pure fear on his face.George's eyes fluttered open as he shifted his shoulders back against the cushions."George!" Fred exclaimed, quickly reaching forward to grab at his twin's arm."Heh," George chuckled hoarsely, "Saintlike."Charlie could not help but laugh."Come again?" Fred raised a brow."Saintike." George kept his eyes open now, glancing up at everyone around him before his gaze ended its path on his twin. "I'm holey." He grinned, "I'm holey, Fred, get it?"Fred rolled his eyes, though a smirk was forming on his lips. "Really? With the whole wide world of ear-related humor...and you go for 'I'm holey'?" He shook his head, "Pathetic if you ask me." He teased his twin."Reckon I'm still better looking than you." George shot back with a smirk.Adelaide let go of Charlie to walk over to the other side of the room. She wanted to make sure everyone else was okay and not in need of any help."Where's Moody?" she spun around, not seeing the usually hard-to-miss Auror."He didn't make it." Bill stepped through the front door, his hand tightly grasping Fleur's as he looked over everyone with a shake of his head.It was then that everyone started questioning each other. Adelaide found her way back into the kitchen, putting together some supplies for George's wound. The incessant chatter of everyone speaking at once was too much for her. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ After getting George into his old bedroom and bidding everyone goodnight, Adelaide was still lingering in the kitchen in silence. Her fingernails scratching at the sensitive skin at her wrist, her eyes focused on the window above the sink. She wasn't even sure what she was looking at. The sky. The stars. The moon. The hopeful idea that Sirius was somewhere in the atmosphere, waiting for her to join him.The sky was dark – almost black – but the stars scattered around made it not as intimidating. Adelaide had never been afraid of the dark, even as a child, but after the events of the past year she was becoming increasingly worried when the sun would begin to set."Hey, I didn't realize you were still here."Adelaide turned around with a gasp. "Charles Weasley! You cannot do that to me." Both of her hands were now pressed against her chest, feeling the rapid beating of her heart as his voice had scared her out of the trance she had been trapped in. "I'm sorry." Charlie sighed with a playful pout. "I thought you would have heard my footsteps." He admitted, running his fingers through his hair as he walked closer to his best friend. He could sense something was bothering her and he wanted her to know that he was there for her."Do you want to talk about it?" he spoke up again after a few minutes of comfortable silence between them. Adelaide had turned back around to face the window, her hands resting on the sink below."About what? The fact that I'm absolutely terrified of what's to come? That I'm in no way ready to fight this war?" She scoffed, feeling embarrassed that she seemed to be the only one not prepared for the looming war ahead of them."Addy, come on. You have nothing to feel bad about. We're all scared."With that, Adelaide turned on her heel and took flight. She had no idea where her feet were taking her until she was there.The lake. The small little beach that she had spent so much time growing up at on the Weasley property.She sensed Charlie following hot on her trail and she began smiling at the thought of how much he seemed to care. There was a spark of something in her belly at the thought of what lengths he would go to protect her, to help her. But just as soon as she started to feel happy, the feeling was ripped from her and replaced with guilt. She shouldn't be happy, especially not with Charlie.Going over every possible term of endearment that he could come up with in his head was not as easy as it should have been. Charlie moved another step forward, then another, and another, before he reached forward and grabbed onto Adelaide's arms. He pulled her back, swiftly, into his chest. He really hoped she didn't put up a fight.Coincidentally, Charlie got exactly what he was wishing for.Adelaide didn't put up a fight because the second she felt his chest against her back, she broke down. Tears streaming down her cheeks as she reached up and grabbed onto his forearms, pressing herself closer to Charlie as she sobbed.Minutes could have very well been hours. Adelaide had not the slightest clue as to how long she cried in his arms, but at the shifting of his weight to bring her down against the sand with him, Adelaide made an unattractive sniffle before wiping at her nose."I can't believe I just cried like that. Charlie, I'm so sorry." The healer sighed, now covering her face with her hands out of sheer embarrassment."Stop." Charlie reached forward with both hands, pulling her hands away from her face so he could look into her eyes. He then wrapped his arms around her shoulders and pressed his lips against the top of her head. "We've known each other since we were kids, Addy. You never, ever, have to apologize to me for crying in front of me."Adelaide, again, did not put up a fight. She pressed her face into Charlie's chest with a heavy sigh. "I can't help it. I mean... I'm just so weak. I don't think that I can do this. I can't fight this war. More importantly, I can't help the order win this war!"Charlie sighed. He hated that she felt this way. He felt a loss, deep within him, at the shaking sensation of her shoulders as her body starting racking with sobs again. "I don't know what else to say to you, Ads. You are important to this war. You're important to the order... and to me. You're important to me."Adelaide let herself cry for a little while longer. Hearing Charlie's declaration of her importance to him helped bring her down from the dark cloud she was on. "I feel guilty." She finally spoke up, leaning back just enough to look up at his face. She would have thought that by now the number of freckles that painted across his face would have been a distant memory. But the truth was, they weren't. They never would be. And she thought of them so often that the guilt that followed was just too strong."You have nothing to feel guilty about." Charlie assured her. He didn't know what she felt guilty about, she didn't go into further detail, and he also was not going to press her for it."No, that's the thing, I do." Adelaide sighed and sat back a bit more, hugging her knees close to her chest. "I shouldn't feel..." her voice trailed off as she looked over at Charlie. "Happy. I shouldn't think of moving on." She looked away, embarrassed again. She wasn't ready to admit anything more to Charlie. Really – she wasn't ready to admit anything to herself."That's not true. You deserve happiness. You deserve to make the choice in whether you are able to move on or not. Adelaide," Charlie shifted to face her now, "You are the most selfless person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing." He smiled as she gave a playful roll of her eyes."You're my best friend, Charlie. You have an obligation to say these kinds of things to me.""That may be true..." he laughed as she reached over to playfully push his shoulders. "But I also mean it. Truly, I do. And I know it may be painful to hear but Sirius... he would have wanted you to be happy. I may have not seen eye to eye with him on some things, but there is one thing that we both agreed on."Adelaide chewed on her bottom lip, "Me?""Yes. You."

A U G U S T 1997The day of Bill and Fleur’s wedding had finally arrived. After the ceremony and well into the reception, and both were perfect in every way, Adelaide found herself mingling around the tent with a goblet of elf wine, filled to the brim, in her hand. She just got over listening to Fred and George rant about steering clear of their Aunt Muriel. As she eyed the left side of the tent to see if her parents were at their table, she spotted the wretched woman herself. And judging by the irate expression on the older woman’s face, Adelaide knew Fred and George were not overexaggerating.With another sip of the wine, something she had not indulged in since the passing of Sirius, the healer moved through the crowd to her designated table. A soft smile appeared on her lips as she glanced at the place card that was beside hers. Charlie Weasley.She knew that this was all Fleur’s doing. Bill probably had something to do with it, as well. Fleur’s mastermind plan to get them together seemed to be working, so it was only fair that she would sit them together. Not that Adelaide was complaining.As she took her seat and another sip of the wine, Adelaide set her glass down and let out a soft sigh. Today was a happy day. And she refused to think, or feel, otherwise. Her eyes roamed around the tent, watching people catch up with one another, dancing and laughing without a care in the world before her gaze finally found the one person she had been looking for.Charlie was standing beside Arthur and Bill, his head thrown back and wild laughter escaped from between his lips. That was the Charlie she knew. The Charlie she lov-liked. The Charlie she liked. His smile made her smile. His happiness was like a parasite – forcing its way into her system and destroying the darkness within her. The feeling of security that he offered her was more than she could have ever asked for. She knew from their conversation the night they brought Harry to the burrow that her safety was important to him – just as it was to Sirius.It was hard to not think that Charlie was just protecting her out of the kindness of his heart and that there were no other feelings involved. What if he was just protecting her because of a promise he had made to Sirius before he died? She didn’t want, nor need, his pity.Once their eyes met, Charlie excused himself from his brother and father and made his way to Adelaide. The look in his eyes as he approached her made Adelaide believe that it was not pity that he felt towards her, but something else. Something stronger, something deeper.“Can you believe my big brother has officially tied the knot?” Charlie teased, his hand resting on Adelaide’s shoulder, gently brushing his thumb over her soft, bare skin.The feeling of his calloused skin brushing against her sent shivers down her spine and Adelaide quickly grabbed her goblet of elf wine, downing a rather large gulp before turning to look at Charlie as he took his seat next to her.“Yes, well, he is a grown up now. We all are.” The healer teased back, nudging Charlie’s leg with her foot beneath the table. She gave him a smile before glancing back out near the dance floor. Although she was happy for Bill and Fleur – Remus and Tonks, too – she was still a little envious. She had imagined herself going through the same experiences with Sirius and she just could not shake the guilt she felt about him not having enough time to do all the things they wanted to do, the things they had always talked about. Marriage. Children. Freedom.“Gross, don’t remind me.” Charlie made a face at the mention of being grown up. “Lately some days I’ve been wishing that we could just simply go back in time.” He sighed at the thought. “You know back when we were kids at Hogwarts. No care in the world, other than getting out of detention with McGonagall.”Adelaide laughed. “Speak for yourself. I only had one detention ever. And it was Tonks’ fault! I was just guilty by association.”She wholeheartedly agreed with Charlie, though. She often thought about how easy and carefree life had been before the dark lord made his return. She also thought about how different life would, most likely, be if he had never left her alone in his bed. How different it would be if he had been honest with her and told her that he was moving to Romania.Since his return and connection with the order, though, Adelaide felt the rift between them shrinking. The animosity she felt every time someone mentioned his name, or even a simple passing thought of him, was beginning to be forgotten.“Guilty by association, huh?” Charlie grinned, nudging her right back before he sat up straight at the announcement that Bill and Fleur were going to have their first dance as man and wife.Adelaide turned in her chair, her back now fully exposed to Charlie. She had opted for a slightly more risqué dress this evening – not without the brides approval, of course. The material clung to her body like a second skin and was a deep red. The dress was backless, but the material did not scoop too low. In the words of Fleur Delacour, ‘it is still classy!’.She couldn’t help but try and shake the feeling that while everyone in the room had their eyes on the newly married couple – Charlie did not.The song was soft and slow, and Adelaide felt entranced watching Fleur’s gown flutter around her lean legs as she danced in circles with Bill. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up as a small tickling sensation started creeping up her back, starting at just below where the dress ended and where her skin became completely on display. She shifted slightly in her chair, not turning around yet, though she was beginning to understand where this feeling was coming from – who it was from.Charlie leaned forward, his fingertips gently brushing against the small of Adelaide’s back before he brought them up in a straight line, tracing her spine. That must have been the move of all moves, because almost immediately, Adelaide leaned back into his touch, begging for more. He watched her head turn to the side just enough to look at him from the corner of her eye before she clutched onto the side of the chair. Adelaide turned her head back around to continue watching the first dance, her legs firmly clenched together to try and tamp down the sudden need she was feeling between her thighs.Charlie moved his fingers to spread out at the base of her skull, giving her a gentle squeeze before trailing only the tips of his fingers back down her spine. The healer turned in the chair to face him, catching him off guard because she noticed he jumped slightly now that they were face to face.She went to open her mouth, to try and clear the air between then, but quickly opted to shut her mouth once more. She leaned forward, slipping her hand onto his thigh as she held his gaze. Neither of them dared to utter a word to the other. Most likely afraid of ruining whatever this moment was, whatever was happening between them.At the same time Charlie started leaning forward to bridge the gap between them, a bright light entered the tent. This was the only reason he broke the eye contact he had been holding with Adelaide. The collective gasp that could be heard from everyone around them caused the blonde to turn and stand. Charlie followed suit and they both made it closer to the dance floor.

“The Ministry has fallen.”

Adelaide’s eyes were wide with fear. Instantly, she turned to look back at Charlie. “That’s Kingsley’s patronus.” She told him in disbelief.

“The Minister of Magic is dead.”

It was then that complete chaos broke out. A few people around them began to disapparate just as clouds of black smoke broke out, signaling that Death Eaters were arriving for an attack.“Adelaide, look at me. Look at me!” Charlie grabbed onto her shoulders and pulled her close. “Find Ginny. And get out of here. Even if you need to disapparate somewhere far away, do it. Get out. Get far away from here. Please.”Adelaide was at a loss for words. She didn’t want to leave. She wasn’t sure what had come over her, but she felt a sudden surge of confidence. She wanted to stay. She wanted to fight. But as she looked up at Charlie, watching the fear wash over him as spells began shooting out around them.“Yes, yes. Okay, I will. I promise.” She finally choked out, reaching down but soon realizing that she didn’t have her wand on her and that her bag was on the table they had left behind. She held her hand out, utilizing wandless magic to summon her bag. Somehow, through the chaos around them, the bag made it to her hands, and she pulled her wand out before turning to look back up at Charlie.He needed her to know. If this was the last time that they saw one another – she needed to know. Charlie leaned down and pressed his lips against hers in a rough kiss. Short, not to sweet. Adrenaline was coursing through his veins, and he had already been feeling confident in making a move on Adelaide – the attack just helped him escalate his actions.She would be lying if she said she was surprised at the roughness of Charlie’s lips against hers. She knew they didn’t have time for this, but it was like she could sense what he was thinking – what he was feeling. This might be the last time they saw one another. They had no idea what the rest of the night would bring and so without taking time to think of anything else but the man infront of her, Adelaide kissed Charlie back just as roughly. She grabbed onto the front of his suit jacket and pulled him down against her before she pushed him away and turned to run off to find Ginny. She couldn’t say goodbye, she couldn’t look him in the eyes. If she did, she would have a harder time leaving his side.All around her, the members of the order were fighting back against the death eaters that had crashed the wedding reception. She ducked to surpass whatever hex Thorfinn Rowle had shot at Fred and George, quickly throwing up a defensive charm for extra protection.She was trying her best to find Ginny through it all and once she saw Ginny huddled behind her parents, she knew she was safe. She spun around and shot a quick hex at Thorfinn, having remembered his face from the attack at Hogwarts two months prior.She certainly didn’t anticipate being so involved, and with pure luck she had been able to stay out of harm’s way. They were looking for Harry, no doubt, and everyone that remained fought back – refusing to provide any information. After all, they really had no idea where the trio had disapparated to. It was the way it had to be.“Gin!” Adelaide hissed, reaching over to slide her hand into Ginny’s in order to pull her in to her side. “Let’s go, before anyone sees us...”Ginny didn’t put up a fight. She nodded in silence and held onto Adelaide like her life depended on it.In the blink of an eye, Adelaide and Ginny had disapparated away from the chaos. Twisting and turning in empty time and space until their feet landed safely atop soft sand. Glancing over her shoulder, making sure nobody followed them, Adelaide let out a sigh of relief.“Where are we?”Ginny had let go of Adelaide’s arm, turning around in a full circle to check out their surroundings.“Shell Cottage.” Adelaide spoke up. “Bill bought this for Fleur.” She smiled at the thought. Bill seemed to have been the most romantic of his siblings.“It’s beautiful.” Ginny sighed, tucking some strands of her now disheveled hair behind her ears.“It is. And more importantly, it’s safe. Come on, let’s go inside.” Adelaide held her hand out to Ginny, grinning when the younger girl took it and walked with her into the house.

Adelaide and Ginny were left to their own defenses for another two hours. The healer did what she could to remain positive, especially for Ginny's sake, but as the third hour since their escape began it was getting hard.Ginny had fallen asleep on the couch about twenty minutes ago and since then, Adelaide could not stop the nervous pacing by the kitchen window.Flashes of light followed by a loud crack sounded off in the distance, just behind the dunes that separated the cottage and the beach. Adelaide took one look back at Ginny, before rushing out of the back door and closer to the shore."Bill!" Adelaide shouted at the sight before her. "Fleur!"Relief flooded through her, the tingling sensation in her fingertips only intensified when she spotted the third person who appeared behind them."Charlie." She breathed out, brushing the hot tears that were now streaming down her cheeks as she rushed forward and collapsed in Charlie's arms."You have no idea how happy I am that you're all safe." Adelaide said, pulling back from the hug as she looked up at Charlie who was already staring down at her with a smile on his lips. His hands reached up, moving from her waist to either side of her face as he leaned down to kiss her forehead.The four of them moved into the house, and after Bill brought Ginny back home and came back to Shell Cottage, they were sitting around the kitchen island discussing what had happened."I'm so sorry that this ruined your reception, Fleur." Adelaide whispered, reaching over to slip her hand over Fleur's, giving her a gentle squeeze.The new bride shook her head. Patting Adelaide's hand with a smile on her lips, "No need to apologize. It's not your fault. And after all," the woman sighed lovingly as she looked over at her new husband, who was deep in conversation with his younger brother. "The important part of the day already happened. Exchanging vows with Bill infront of all our loved ones was what today was all about. A wedding reception is just a party in the end."Adelaide smiled and gave a slight nod. She looked over to the men at the other side of the table and found herself watching Charlie. The way his eyes crinkled in the corners when he smiled or laughed loudly. The way he gave whoever he was speaking to his complete and undivided attention.No! Stop. Stop thinking of him like this.Adelaide shook her head slightly and turned back to Fleur. Unfortunately for Adelaide, Fleur had been watching her the entire time. A hint of mischief twinkled in the bride's eyes before she pushed herself up and went over to Bill."Bill, love," she whispered softly, slipping her hand along his arm as she leaned into his side. "It's time for bed. My feet are killing me." Fleur leaned up to press her lips against her husband's cheek before she leaned forward to kiss Charlie's cheek next."Goodnight, Charlie. Adelaide," She started towards the steps, "There are two rooms up there. Both have beds, so you can have your pick.""Oh, no, that's ok. I was going to head home." Adelaide began to protest but Bill stepped up, following his wife to the stairs."We think it might be best for you to just stay the night. We're not sure if the death eaters are still running around interrogating people to find Harry." He spoke up, resting a hand on Adelaide's shoulder for a moment before he glanced over at Fleur with a smile. "Our home is your home. Atleast for tonight.""But it's your wedding night. I don't want to-"Fleur giggled, waving her hand at Adelaide's continued protests."That's what magic is for Addy." Bill teased, a smirk appearing on his lips as he wiggled his wand around before following his wife up the stairs to their bedroom.Adelaide feigned disgust for a moment before she looked over at Charlie. "Did your brother just...""Yep." Charlie laughed. He stepped up to the staircase, kicked off his shoes and gestured for Adelaide to follow him.Once they got up the stairs, they stood in the hallway between the two guest bedrooms. Adelaide nervously looked down at the ground for a moment before she finally gathered enough courage to lean up and peck Charlie's cheek."Goodnight, Charlie." She whispered to him, keeping her lips near his ear as she did so.Charlie reached out and let his hand rest on her hip. He kept her close for a moment and only let go when he felt her pull back."Goodnight, Addy." ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ After getting out of the dress and into a soft pair of pajamas Fleur provided, Adelaide sat on the bed, on top of the duvet, with her eyes focused on the door. She wasn't sure what she was thinking, or why she was thinking it, but all she wanted to do was get up, open that door and be with Charlie.The tingling sensation, that had once only been in her fingertips, was now spreading throughout her entire body. She wiggled her toes as she wrapped her arms around her legs, pulling in her knees against her chest."Bloody hell, what am I doing?" She groaned, leaning her head down against her forearm before letting out a sigh.All she could think of was how his hands felt on her bare skin. She began remembering what it felt like to have him between her legs, beneath her, behind her. This sent a shiver down her spine as she began clenching her thighs together at the sudden realization that at just the simple memory of being with Charlie made her pulse with need.After what seemed like an eternity of fighting a war with herself, Adelaide moved from the bed and marched with intent to the door. Her hand grasped the doorknob and stayed there for another moment as she started weighing the positives and negatives about doing what she was about to do.Her free hand moved to the ring that still hung around her neck on a simple chain. She rarely took it off, and when she did, it was just to shower. And even then, the moment she stepped out of the shower the ring was back around her neck. Something felt wrong about marching into Charlie's bedroom to spend the night with him all while wearing – technically ­– a dead man's ring.A trembling breath escaped her lips as she took a step back from the door only to turn on her heel and walk back over to the bed. Reaching behind her neck to unclasp the chain and slowly bring the necklace down to the nightstand. The guilt began creeping back up – the intense sadness and grief, that she felt on a regular basis that Sirius was gone, was weaving its way into her mind as she stared down at the ring.She felt like she was betraying him – and maybe in some way that is exactly what she was doing. But she was feeling another strong feeling – desire. And at this moment, desire was winning because as soon as Adelaide set the ring down, she turned back around and opened the door. Once she stepped out into the hallway as silent as she possibly could, she closed the door behind her before creeping over to Charlie's room.Taking in a deep breath, Adelaide raised one hand and went to knock on the door. As soon as her knuckles came close to the wood, the door swung open, and Charlie stood there staring down at her.The tension between them, floating in the space between, was so thick and Adelaide was standing there in Fleur's silk pajamas, feeling slightly out of place. She instantly dropped her hand and started aimlessly playing with the hem of the button up shirt."Hi...""What took you so long?"Adelaide almost choked on her own saliva at the boldness Charlie was displaying. She couldn't help but blush and looked down for a moment to gather her thoughts, not to mention courage, before she looked back up at him. Slowly – very slowly – a smile started creeping its way onto her lips."Oh, shut up." She hissed, pressing her hands against his chest so she could push him into the bedroom before closing the door behind them with her foot.Her chest was heaving up and down, her hands still resting against his chest before they slipped up to his face. Her thumbs began brushing against his cheeks, enjoying the feeling of slight stubble that was beginning to grow back along his jawline. Charlie, since being pushed back into the bedroom, had reached forward to steady himself with his hands on her hips. He refused to let go, squeezing her firmly as he pulled her closer."It's not very kind to leave a man waiting like that, you know." He teased, leaning down to gently brush his lips against hers. He pulled back, just enough, to rest his forehead down against hers."You don't have to wait any longer. I'm here." Adelaide kissed him back, and as he pulled away, she found herself already yearning for more of his touch, his kiss, whatever else he would offer her. "I'm yours." Her breath ghosted across his face before she tilted her head back to offer her lips up to him.Her arms snaked around his neck as they connected, once more, in a heated kiss. The butterflies were still there, fluttering around and making her stomach do nothing but flips and turns. Charlie held her close, almost afraid of letting go and losing her all over again. At her declaration that she was his, Charlie felt confident enough that this time around things would be different. Maybe this time, she wouldn't run away after the fact, and they would be able to have an adult conversation about what was happening between them.But for now... Charlie decided it was best to turn off his thoughts – atleast the serious ones. He smiled down at her, moving one hand to cup the side of her face before he captured her lips once more.Things this time around were different. Slow, sweet, and sober. Adelaide knew exactly what she was doing. The need to feel Charlie was getting to be too much for her handle and she slipped her fingertips beneath the bottom hem of his shirt so she could feel more of him.The sparks were immediate. Adelaide kept her eyes shut as Charlie started walking her back to the bed. Once Adelaide felt the mattress against the back of her knees, she pulled back from his lips and began unbuttoning the sleepshirt she was wearing."Allow me." Charlie whispered out, his voice husky with need.Adelaide let out a nervous giggle but dropped her hands to the side as she gave him a silent nod for consent. Charlie took his time, pressing her lips against the skin that came into view with each new button he popped opened. Once the shirt was completely unbuttoned, he slipped his hands along her stomach, brushing over her breasts and up to her shoulders. He pushed the material over her shoulders and down her arms before removing it completely, throwing it behind them onto the floor.Adelaide let her head tilt back as her eyes fell shut, relishing in the feeling of Charlie's hands and lips against her skin. Though at the sudden feeling of the cool air hitting her legs, she opened her eyes and looked down as Charlie tugged down her pajama pants. He was kneeling before her, hands roaming from her backside, around her hips and down the front of her thighs before wrapping up the back of her thighs so he could remove every remaining bit of clothing on her body.Her hands moved to his head, scraping against his scalp as she brushed through his hair and tugged him back up so that he was standing in front of her. Her lips found his in a quick, sloppy kiss before she reached down to pull his shirt up and over his head before throwing it to the floor. She paused, looking up at him as her chest still heaved with each breath she took. He really was beautiful. Especially now – cheeks warming under his gaze that was so intense that she felt her legs begin to turn to jelly. She grabbed hold of the waistband of his pants and as her lips found his once more, she removed the rest of his clothing as he did hers.Once her back was against the mattress, her hands found their way back into his hair. Everything about this moment was different than the last. The way her mind was not swirling with darkness like it had been last year. This time last year, her heart felt as cold as ice and just as hard. She didn't think she would ever truly love again. Or atleast she didn't think she would ever feel open to the possibility of love again."Are you okay?" Charlie whispered against her lips, his body situated between her legs as he slipped a hand down her thigh, hoisting her leg up around his waist."Yes." Adelaide whispered back, nodding eagerly. Her hands moved to cup his face and position him just enough so they could make eye contact. "I'm more than okay, Charlie. I promise. I want you. Now."With her verbal consent, Charlie shifted a hand between them just long enough to align himself with her. In one quick moment, the room was no longer silent, and as he filled her – inch by inch – Adelaide pressed her head back into the pillow and let out a moan.She had not been with anyone else after she slept with Charlie last summer. She couldn't bring herself to have meaningless sex with strangers, no matter how much she knew it would help release some of the pent of stress she had."I've missed this. I've missed you." He told her in earnest.One hand rested beside her head against the mattress while the other gripped tightly onto her hip, keeping her still and pressed down beneath him. He continued pressing forward until he felt himself reach as far between her legs as he could. He had been dreaming about this moment for far too long and knew that he would have to take it easy. He willed the thoughts of already reaching ecstasy and being a disappointment away.Adelaide didn't respond. She couldn't. Not with words anyway. Her mouth had recently formed a rather large "O" shape and as her head pressed back into the pillow beneath her. Her fingernails scratched against his arms as her hands made their way up to either side of his face so once she was no longer arched back, she could look up into his eyes.There was a difference in this intimate moment than the last time they had found themselves beneath the sheets. Or rather, on top of the sheets if you'd like to get technical about it.Without warning, Adelaide nudged Charlie over so she could straddle his waist and press her hands against his chest. She couldn't help but giggle at the shocked expression across Charlie's face. She ran her fingertips along his chest, smiling when she noticed the slight shiver her touch provided him. She leaned down and let her lips gently brush against his while she began moving her hips in hopes that she would be able to bring them both as much pleasure as possible.Charlie wrapped his arms around her waist, keeping her body close to his. This was the feeling he had been chasing for so long. Not just Adelaide's physical touch, but the emotional bond between them. For so long he had the hope that it could spark off into something more than what it already was.They had rolled around again until Charlie was the one positioned on top. Adelaide kept her hands on his cheeks, holding onto his gaze as he began to move within her once more. A soft moan escaped her lips as she finally let the pleasure take control. Her eyes fell shut as Charlie pressed his face into the crook of her neck and even though most of his body weight was now pressing against her, keeping her pinned to the bed, she did not complain.There was an unspoken connection between the two because as soon as Adelaide's breaths started coming out in shorter, harder pants, Charlie knew she was close to the precipice of her ecstasy. He felt intoxicated on her scent – clean and pure like a freshly picked handful of daisies.Without realizing what was happening, Adelaide began crying. Charlie's hips were roughly pounding into her, but still gentle in a way that all her senses seemed heightened. Her skin felt like it was being set on fire and the burn was becoming addicting. They had taken things slow, and they weren't rushed in the sense that all they wanted was a way to express pent up frustration and need. Adelaide did not come to his room in just the need of getting laid. They were deeply intertwined with one another, physically and emotionally.Scraping her fingernails against his skin, enjoying the feeling of his muscled back beneath her touch. She knew she was close to pure bliss so she tugged at his hair, pulling his head up so she could look into his eyes when it happened. She ignored the warm, salty tears streaming down her cheeks, but she could see that he was becoming upset that she was crying. His hips were nowhere near ready to start slowing their pace, but he wanted to make sure he wasn't hurting her in any way."Are yo-""I'm okay, Charlie. I'm okay." She cut him off, shaking her head as she moved one hand to wipe at her cheeks before she grabbed his face again and pulled him in for a rough, searing kiss.It wasn't long until she reached her high. Her toes curled, her back arched, and her eyes squeezed shut as she broke away from his lips so an extremely telling moan could escape. That was all Charlie needed to accelerate his hips as his hands squeezed her soft flesh, reaching his own peak as he spilled himself inside of her.Moving his hands to the mattress on either side of her head, Charlie slowed his hips until they completely stilled – remaining between her legs and inside of her as he caught his breath. Adelaide let out a soft sigh out of pure elation. She kept her lets tightly locked around Charlie's backside as she reached up to brush a strand of his hair back from his eyes."Hi." She whispered softly, a soft giggle escaping as she did so.Charlie shook his head, the tip of his nose nuzzling against hers before he pulled out of her and shifted off to the side. He kept one arm wrapped around her waist as his head rested against her chest."Promise me you'll still be here in the morning, Addy." Charlie didn't like to beg, but right now all he wanted was to fall asleep next to his best friend. Sex aside, he felt the need to have something real to hold on to while he slept. The events of that night were enough to shake him, the fear spread quickly throughout his mind.What if he couldn't keep Adelaide safe? Or his family? It terrified him to the core at the thought of losing someone. During his life in Romania, it was easy for Charlie to take things for granted but now that he was back home – atleast for right now – he refused to live that way.Adelaide wrapped her arm around Charlie's shoulders, gently playing with his hair as she nestled back into the bed. She shivered at the cool air hitting her skin, now that she wasn't actively moving, she could feel the air ghost across her skin. She reached down and tugged at the blanket, moving with Charlie to shimmy both of their bodies beneath the warmth and protection of the duvet. Neither of them moved to get dressed, and that was fine with Adelaide.The more she thought about it, the more she knew she wouldn't deny the pleasure she felt cuddled up into Charlie – naked or not. As Charlie leaned his head back to look up at her, she realized that she didn't respond to his statement. She gave him a soft smile, playfully ruffling up his hair before she leaned down and kissed him fervently. The hand that was not currently tangled in his hair moved to run along his arm before cupping his jaw and holding him close."I promise." 

When Adelaide felt the warm morning rays against her skin, she let her eyes flutter open. At first, she was slightly confused.Where was she? And why was there a man on top of her? Glancing down, rather quickly, the healer found herself smiling at what she laid her eyes upon.Charlie.He was sound asleep with his head still resting against her bare chest. She had no idea how they stayed in the same position all night but as she attempted to shift her body, only slightly, the dull ache in her lower back began to scream out. She stopped moving instantly for if she irritated the pained muscles in her back again, she would most likely wake the sleeping dragon tamer and with one look down at him she realized that was something she did not want to do.He looked so peaceful. And quite adorable. His hair was a mess and hanging down into his face so, very gently, she slipped her fingers through the red curls to pull the strands away from his eyes and let her own eyes falls shut once more."How long have you been awake?" Charlie grumbled against her breast before giving her sensitive skin a soft, sweet kiss.Adelaide giggled, shivering under the sudden touch. Although he had been sleeping against her, there was something sensual about the soft kiss he placed upon her."Only just a minute." She responded, looking down at him once she felt him shift his body away from hers, now lying beside her on the bed. "What about you?""A few minutes before you, I'm sure. I didn't want move, though. You are far too comfortable to sleep on."Adelaide playfully smacked his chest, turning to lay on her side as she pulled the blanket up to cover her modesty – though really at this point, why she even bothered she haven't a clue."I'm worried, Charlie." Adelaide nervously began chewing at her bottom lip as she looked over at her best friend. He furrowed his brows and turned to face her, now laying on his side as well."About what?""This war, you git." The healer playfully rolled her eyes. She would do her best to find the humor in the situation, no matter how serious it was. "Last night was terrifying. We're lucky no one was hurt. Now that the ministry has fallen to the dark lord and his followers, everything that we know is going to change."Charlie sighed. He knew she was right. He hated when she was right. "We'll get through it together." He began, reaching over to gently place his hand on the side of her head. He brushed his thumb along her cheek before he leaned over and pressed his lips against hers.Adelaide knew what he was doing – and it was working. The feeling of his lips against hers wiped her mind clean of all her doubts and worries. Her eyes shut instantly, and she shifted her body closer to his, feeling his bare chest beneath her fingertips as they both parted their lips. Tongue dancing against tongue, a soft moan escaped her lips as Charlie entered her swiftly, holding her close to him as he rocked his hips against hers.Adelaide held tight onto Charlie as they soon found themselves in the same position that they were in last night.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇"So, what you're saying is," Adelaide looked up at Bill from her mug of tea, a soft sigh escaping her lips. "Is that everywhere and anywhere in Europe is not safe and we need to create safe houses for the order and those who support us?"Bill nodded.Charlie was seated beside her, his mug now cold and empty as he sat in silence. Maybe going back to Romania, where he would have more freedom and possibly more safety, was the best option for him."And we were thinking of making this one of them." Fleur spoke up after she picked up Charlie's empty mug and set it into the sink with her own. "Nobody knows Bill bought the house, or the location of it."Bill nodded in agreement. "And we have the space, and not to mention the beach. With enough protective wards, I think we can try to make this as easy as we possibly can. Dad said you helped with the wards they put up after last Christmas. Would you be willing to help?"Adelaide sat for a while and thought about her options. Truly, she didn't know where to begin. Her parents would need protection, and she would need to tell them about the order's plans. "Of course I'll help with the wards. I just need to tell my parents before anything else. I have to figure out what they are planning on doing."Charlie looked over at her and reached for her hand. He gently placed his on top of hers and gave her a reassuring smile. "Do you want me to come with?"Adelaide shook her head. "No, no. I'll be okay.""Adelaide," Fleur spoke up, her eyes traveling from the couple sitting infront of her to her husband. A small smirk appeared on her thin lips before she took a seat. "Bill and I spoke about it last night. We want to offer you a place here. In our home. And you, too, Charlie."Adelaide slipped her fingers through Charlie's before she turned to look at Fleur. "Thank you, Fleur. Truly, that is so kind of you." She gave Charlie a squeeze before she moved to stand up from the table. "Let me speak with my parents and I'll be back tonight."Charlie got up beside her, following her out of Shell Cottage like a lovesick puppy. "Are you sure you don't need me to come with you?"Adelaide smiled softly, turning to look up at Charlie as she got closer to the dunes, which was the safest apparition point. "Charles Weasley, I will be just fine." She couldn't help but chuckle at the man before her. She slipped her hands up his chest, hooking them behind his neck as she stood up on the tips of her toes to kiss his lips. "I'll come back."The healer was gone in the blink of an eye, so Charlie found his way back into the front door of his brothers new home. He stopped moving as he felt the eyes of both his brother and his new wife on him."What?""Have you told her yet?""Told her? Told her what?"Charlie stared over at Fleur who was grinning as though she were a madman - correction, a madwoman­ – who had just found the secret ingredient to their diabolical plan to take over the world. He was trying his best at playing dumb but of course his older brother caught on rather quickly. Charlie could never lie, especially to his family."What?" Charlie guffawed. "Don't look at me like that. The both of you look mad."Bill laughed. He glanced from his brother down to his wife before he spoke again. "It's very obvious that you spent the night with Adelaide. And not in the separate rooms we had prepared for you.""Ah...yes, well..." Charlie began, rubbing at the back of his neck for a moment as he racked his brain about what to say next."You still have not answered my question, Charlie."Fleur was too nosy for her own good. Charlie groaned a bit out of annoyance. The more he thought about it, the more he wanted to try and keep secret out of fear that if he spoke it out loud – it would dissolve into nothingness and be lost in the wind once more.Fleur must have noticed that there was a slight change in Charlie's demeanor because she stepped forward and rested her hand on his upper arm. "Don't worry, your secret is safe with us. We're happy for you, Charlie. Truly."Charlie smiled and looked between his brother and sister-in-law. It was a silent thank you before he left and headed back upstairs.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇Meeting with her parents was more tumultuous than she originally thought it would be. Her mother was a wreck – having left the wedding reception with her husband the moment Kingsley's patronus entered the tent and announced that the ministry had fallen. Adelaide could sense that there was something more than fear in her mother's eyes and chose to hold her in a loving embrace while she discussed the plans with her father.Faustus would continue working and even though he held an important position within the ministry, he knew he would be the safest there. Adele, on the other hand, refused to continue working within those walls that now housed the dark and nasty Death Eaters."The Order is creating safe houses, Mum. We can have you stay with us at Shell Cottage." Adelaide told her, forcing a small smile on her lips as she looked down at her Mum who was now sitting by the front window, staring up at the darkening sky."No, my love," Adele shook her head and looked over at her daughter with a smile. "We will stay right here. Your father has already agreed and will put up some extra wards and all will be fine."Adelaide nodded. She understood her parents and their desire for staying in their own home. But for her – this was not home. Not anymore."We know you must go." Faustus spoke up from the opposite side of the room now. "You are more involved than we ever were....more than we care to be, if I'm being quite honest. I wish you weren't." he moved to envelope his daughter in a protective hug. "But I know you will be safe with Charlie.""Charlie?" Adelaide sniffled a bit, looking up at her father once she stepped away from the hug.Faustus grinned, "Yes, my darling girl, you have a glow about you." He let one hand rest on the side of her face as he spoke, his thumb lovingly grazing over her soft skin. "Something that has been missing for quite some time now. I don't want you to lose it. Not again."That was all it took for Adelaide to break down. The guilt was beginning to bubble up again, but she quickly pressed her face into her father's chest and breathed in his familiar scent. She hated to admit that it was true – Charlie was making her happy. How much time was enough time to get over losing the person you thought was your soulmate? Can you have more than one soulmate?Adelaide squeezed her eyes shut to try and ignore the questions floating around her head before she pulled back from her father and let out a deep breath. She knew she had to pack some of her things up and head back to Shell Cottage eventually but for right now she would spend as much time with her parents as she could.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇Adelaide didn't get back to Shell Cottage until late. Once she appeared on the dunes behind the home, she whispered a quick spell beneath her breath to bring her luggage back to its normal size. She tucked the wand in her back pocket before grabbing her bags and heading over to the back door."I was beginning to worry that you weren't coming back." Bill spoke up, moving to stand from the chair he had been nestled in with a book. He closed it before setting it down on the chair. He walked over to Adelaide and took her bags with a smile."Nonsense." Adelaide laughed softly, giving Bill a playful roll of her eyes before she let out a soft sigh. "Is Charlie here?"Bill smirked. "He just got back not too long ago. Moved his things upstairs before the rest of the order gets here.""What's going on?" Instantly, Adelaide felt dread coursing through her veins. Why were they meeting so soon? Did something else happen? In her opinion, they should have let things settle down before gathering in one location again."Everyone is okay." Bill did what he could to calm her nerves. He knew Adelaide and he knew what she looked like when she was worried. "But we need to come up with a plan. This place is only so big, we need to find a few more safe houses and get them set up as soon as possible."Adelaide nodded in agreement. She was curious to find out if anyone else was going to stay with them here. Things were not official with Charlie but if she needed to, she would certainly stay in the same room as him in order to make room for someone else who needed to stay there. The thought of sleeping next to Charlie every night made her stomach do a few flips – the good kind.Once they were both inside and Adelaide had settled her bags in the room she had initially planned on sleeping in the night before, the healer found herself lingering in the doorway of Charlie's room.He was currently bent over the desk, scribbling on a piece of parchment with his tongue sticking out of the corner of his pursed lips."What's got you so deep in thought?" she walked over the threshold and stood behind him. Without a second thought, she let her hands slip along his shoulder blades before resting on top of his shoulders. She peered over his head as he turned a bit to glance up at her with a smile."Hugo." Charlie told her with a sigh. "He wants me back in Romania."Immediately, Adelaide drops her hands and takes a step back. She knew that he would most likely be safer in Romania but the thought of not having him by her side was painful.Charlie could feel the sudden departure of Adelaide and turned in his chair to look up at her. "Oh, no, no," he shook his head and got up to limit the space between their bodies. His hands cupped either side of her face and he brought his lips down to hers. "I'm not going." He whispered against her lips before pulling away just enough to look into her eyes.He felt compelled to ensure that she knew he would not be abandoning her. And the more he thought about it, the more he realized that if he was going to go back to Romania, he would do whatever he could to take Adelaide with him.Adelaide relished in the feeling of his hands against her cheeks, the protection it provided her was something she would always look forward to. "Are you sure?" she whispered back up at him, her hands moving to gently grab at his wrists in order to hold his hands against her face and keep him there. "Because, Charlie, I do not want to be the one to hold you back."Charlie chuckled. "You could never hold me back. From anything. To be quite honest, if I was going to head back to the sanctuary, I would drag you with me." He was smirking down at her, his forehead resting against hers.Adelaide rolled her eyes. She was about to go back at him with something playful but had been cut off by a cough in the doorway. She turned and let out a shriek, pulling herself away from Charlie."Tonks!" she cried, pressing a hand to her chest as she tried to will away the blush that was certainly rising on her cheeks. "How long have you been standing there?"Tonks was beaming. Her lips stretched from ear to ear in the widest grin Adelaide had ever seen on her best friend. "Oh, you know, not long at all." The woman let out a girlish giggle as she looked between Charlie and Adelaide."I'll let you two catch up and see you both downstairs." Charlie cleared his throat, ignoring the idea that Adelaide could be embarrassed about having been with him. He smiled at her as he stepped past her, giving Tonks a nudge as he went."Adelaide Corden!" Tonks exclaimed with her arms thrown up in the air. "Or, should I say Adelaide Weasley!?""Don't you dare, Nymphadora!" the healer glared, albeit playfully, at her friend before she tugged her into the room and closed the door behind her. "Keep your voice down! I don't need the whole order knowing about Charlie and I.""So, there is a possibility that you could be Adelaide Weasley then?" Tonks teased, choosing to ignore the fact that she called her Nymphadora. She knew she'd get back at her eventually. Maybe embarrassing her about Charlie would be payment enough."No." Adelaide groaned, covering her face with her hands as she sank down on the edge of the bed."Well, maybe not yet but don't give up hope." Tonks teased, sitting down beside her friend before she laid back on the bed with her hands behind her head.Adelaide remained silent, glancing back at Tonks for a moment before she laid back beside her. The silence was calming, at first, but Adelaide could sense Tonks becoming impatient. She could sense the pregnancy hormones causing her best friend to be even more nosey and emotional. Poor Remus, Adelaide thought with a soft chuckle."Well?" Tonks urged Adelaide to speak. "Tell me everything. And before you say anything, I promise not to tell anyone." Tonks glanced away as she spoke."You're a terrible liar, Tonks. You can't even look at me!" Adelaide giggled, glancing over at her friend as she waited for her to look back."Okay, fine. I'll probably tell Remus. But that's because he's my husband and the father of my unborn child. I cannot lie to the man! He sees right through me!"Tonks' outburst caused Adelaide to break out in a fit of giggles. She immediately rolled over onto her side and propped her head up in her hand so she could look at Tonks as she recalled the events of the previous night. Tonks listened intently with wide eyes. Adelaide ignored the constant changing of her hair color. With every different emotion, the unruly strands of Tonks' hair changed hues."How big i-" Tonks was cut off as the bedroom opened to reveal Fleur."Ladies, everyone is downstairs." The petite woman smiled warmly at the two before stepping back into the hallway."She just barged in here like she owns the place!" Tonks whispered, "What if we were doing something...I don't know, naughty?"Adelaide laughed, shaking her head. "Tonks, get your mind out of the gutter." She nudged her friend, standing up and helping her as well."Also, she does own the place."In a fit of girlish giggles, the two walked arm-in-arm down the hallway and staircase to greet the rest of the remaining members of The Order.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇It was hard to discuss the creation of safe houses and not ask about Harry, Ron, and Hermione and their whereabouts. Nobody knew where they were, but everyone hoped that they were safe.Adelaide continued telling herself that the three of them were smart – Hermione, especially – so they were probably tending to the task that Dumbledore had apparently left for them to complete.Shell Cottage would be the main safe house, according to Bill and Fleur, and they were more than happy to open their doors to anyone else that needed to stay with them. The Weasleys' Aunt Muriel, miserable woman that she is, was also opening her home up as a safe house."Drown me in the ocean if we ever have to stay with dear old Aunt Muriel." Charlie whispered over to Adelaide, a smirk growing on his lips."Charlie!" Adelaide giggled, slapping his arm gently with a playful stare before she focused back on Remus who was discussing what they could all be doing.It was more likely that the Death Eaters would be taking more control of other large magical corporations now that they had control of the entire Ministry. Although she knew that they were trying not to stare, Adelaide felt the gaze of most of the people who surrounded her at the table."No.""Addy, please, you have to be careful.""And what? You want me to quit my job? I can't do that. I won't."The healer stared at Remus, the anger rising quickly within her before she looked over at his wife – her best friend."You agree with him?" she questioned.Tonks sighed. "Addy... it's-" she trailed off and shifted more in her chair as she looked over at Charlie who was nervously bouncing his leg beneath the table. He knew this wouldn't go over well."You would be a target." Kingsley spoke up from the other end. He stood behind the chair that George was occupying, his hands grabbing tightly onto the wood."Why would I be a target?"Almost immediately, Adelaide knew she would come to regret bringing this up. She should have never questioned why she would be a target. She already knew the answer."Ms. Corden, "Kingsley sighed, "You were an important factor in the life of Sirius Black. And Bellatrix knows who you are. She killed him and who is to say she would not want to personally target you?"Charlie reached out instantly to grab hold of Adelaide's thigh. He could sense that she wanted to get up and flee the meeting, but he wouldn't let her."What if I escort her every shift? To and from?" Charlie spoke up, giving her a weak smile. Adelaide smiled back, a silent thank you before she looked back to Kingsley and then to Remus.Without even a thought, Remus agreed. Kingsley shrugged and Adelaide knew if she died it would not truly affect him in any way, he was just doing his job as a member of the order.As the population within Shell Cottage trickled down to the remaining individuals who were going to inhabit the home, Adelaide found herself curled up in the armchair by the fireplace after she bid Remus and Tonks farewell. She hated the fact that Charlie would have to take time out of his day to escort her to and from her shifts at St. Mungos. She knew he didn't mind, though. After all, it gave him the ability to spend more time with her.At some point, Charlie joined her by the fireplace. He stayed silent but reached over to gently take her hand in his. Whatever the future would bring them, Charlie knew that he would do whatever he could to keep her safe. 

D E C E M B E R 1997"Aren't you worried about them? Your brother, especially?"Adelaide was currently wrapped tightly in a thick wool blanket – knit by none other than Molly Weasley. She was sure the woman was going insane while hiding out with Arthur's Aunt Muriel. Charlie was perched behind her, his arms and legs spread wide to house her between them.Since the wedding, they had not had any further serious conversation about their relationship. Adelaide's things remained in the spare bedroom, but most nights she found her way into Charlie's bed. On the nights that she stayed within her own bed of Shell Cottage, Charlie found his way in. Tonight was no different. They had spent time wrapped up in one another, whispering sweet nothings, promising protection, birthday wishes for the following week as they both were turning another year older in a few days' time."Of course I am." Charlie sighed.In truth, he worried about the safety of his youngest brother, and his two best friends. He thought about the trio often and wondered where they were, what they were doing. His arms tightened around her shoulders, keeping her safely tucked against his chest."I worry, too, but I know that they are smart. Smarter than we all have given them credit for." Adelaide turned slightly to look back at him with a grin."Especially Hermione." They ended up speaking the young girls name in unison. Adelaide ended up giggling as Charlie affectionately kissed her temple, the one closest to his lips as he leaned in close.Resting close with one another looking up at the sky, Adelaide and Charlie ended up recounting their times out on the Hogwarts quidditch pitch late at night. Adelaide, of course, safely on the ground. Charlie, on the other hand, widely flying through the darkened sky. Adelaide was always afraid of heights, though she did let Charlie bring her up every so often. It usually ended in tears – on her behalf, and then laughter on Charlie's end."Don't start laughing at me again, Charles Weasley!" Adelaide laughed herself. She turned some more and gave him a playful glare. "You always laugh at me and it's not very nice!"Charlie was still laughing, his head thrown back though his arms stayed around her tightly. "I do it out of lov-"*CRACK*He was cut off by the obvious sound of someone apparating nearby. Immediately, Charlie stood up with Adelaide and grabbed his wand before making sure she had her own."Stay by my side, Addy." Charlie hissed down at her as his free hand reached down to slip into hers. He looked around and did his best in searching through the dark."Ron!" Adelaide cried out. She spotted his limping figure closer to the dunes and ripped her hand from Charlies to run and greet the younger Weasley boy. "Ron! Are you alright?" Though as soon as Adelaide got closer to the boy, she could tell that he most certainly was not alright. He looked horrible – sickly and tired.Charlie rushed forward and held his wand up directly at Ron's neck. "If you really are Ronald Weasley, tell me what I told you back in Egypt."Adelaide stared at Charlie in surprise but knew that he was doing this for their own protection. Remus taught them to be always on their guard. Adelaide also knew that most people thought Ron was sick at home with spattergroit, but this could still be a trick.Ron seemed to be taken back with the wand pressed into the side of his neck. He looked between Adelaide and Charlie and took in a deep breath. Adelaide could have sworn that it almost looked like he was unsure of responding to Charlie's interrogation – and not because he didn't know the answer, but because he didn't think Charlie would want him to say it out loud for her to hear."Y-You told me that you loved Romania b-but that only one thing was missing, and you would do anything to bring that one thing back to you."Charlie's cheeks were red as he quickly glanced to Adelaide before he dropped his hand. He quickly brought his brother into a tight hug. "What are you doing here? Where are the others?"Adelaide embraced Ron after Charlie stepped back. She mentally made a note in the back of her mind to remind herself to have a serious conversation with Charlie – Ron's response to his brother's question was obviously the right one, which meant that Charlie talked about her with his brother all those years ago."I can't tell you where they're at. Because, well," Ron sighed, "To be quite honest I'm not exactly sure where they are now. Certainly won't be where I left them for much longer."Charlie and Adelaide ushered Ron inside. Adelaide worked on gathering his things, easing the weight from his shoulders. She went through his bag, with his consent and instruction, on what could be washed and mended, as Fleur and Bill rushed over and fussed over Ron.Adelaide took Ron's things into the back room and with the use of her wand, cleaned his clothing and mended rips and holes wherever she could find them. She was busy humming softly beneath her breath, tapping one foot on the floor as she folded Ron's clothes the muggle way. She enjoyed doing some of the household chores the muggle way – folding laundry, mostly. She did not hear the door open nor did she hear the footsteps behind her either."Charlie!" she cried, jumping in her spot as she felt the man's hands grab onto her arms and pull her back against his chest. She knew it was him by the smell that quickly invaded her nostrils and the firm grip of his strong hands on her arms."How many times have I told you not to sneak up on a girl?" she teased.Charlie stood behind her, grinning widely. "You know I don't listen to you." He teased, his hands running down her arms until they moved to her waist."Charlie."Adelaide didn't want to risk being caught by anyone and nudged him away from her before turning to face him. "How is Ron? He's a git for leaving them, you know." She mumbled the last part beneath her breath as she leaned back against the sink."He's all kinds of messed up. It seems like dark magic to me, though I can't be too sure. He isn't saying much about it.""Knowing what I know about Dumbledore know... I don't doubt that some type of dark magic is involved."The two stood in silence, staring at one another, unsure of what to say next. Adelaide so badly wanted to ask Charlie about what Ron said outside. She wanted to know but was also worried about the severity of the conversation. The emotions that would surely come with it. She didn't think she was ready for a conversation as serious as this one."It's getting late." Adelaide cleared her throat, turning back around to gather all of Ron's newly cleaned clothes in a neat pile before she held it safely in her hands. "I'll see you upstairs?"Charlie smiled. "Yeah, I'll give Ron my room."Once Adelaide left, Charlie waited a few minutes before following her.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇Once Charlie helped Ron get comfortable in his room, he made his way over to the other guest room where Adelaide was waiting for him."Ron's all settled in?"Charlie glanced over his shoulder as he shut the door behind him, a weak smile appearing on his lips. "Yeah, he is. But he's...different. You caught that, right?""Yeah, he doesn't look well." Adelaide sighed. She was not familiar with the adventure the golden trio had been on the past few months. She wasn't sure what Dumbledore had left for them to accomplish but she knew it was not good. Behind his gaze, Adelaide could see Ron's eyes filled with dark magic. Something, maybe someone, was messing with him from the inside out. He looked terrible and it pained Adelaide that she could not heal him."I heard him muttering to himself about a locket but didn't see anything on him that looked like one." Charlie mentioned to the healer as he slowly settled back into the bed with his back against the headboard. His eyes shut for a moment before he opened once he felt the dip in the mattress beside him."Whatever it is," Adelaide curled up into his side, her hand slipping onto his chest as she leaned her head on his shoulder, "I'm sure the three of them will figure it out. Maybe the locket was cursed. Dark magic can do so much in such a short amount of time. I'm angry that he left them, although I know they're both more than capable of handling things themselves...""Well, like you said... you have to remember that dark magic is most likely at play here. Maybe it's out of Ron's control." Charlie wrapped his arm around her shoulders and began brushing his fingertips along her lower back.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇Both Charlie and Adelaide's 25th birthdays came and went. Adelaide worked a shift at St. Mungos while Charlie safely traveled to his Aunt Muriel's to spend time with his parents and the twins.It felt strange... Being another year older without Sirius by her side. She still felt the tremendous loss, though spending time with Charlie and rekindling the feelings they once had back in school was helping her move on.She felt grateful to have lived twenty-five years on this earth having known two great loves. That was more than some people could say.Christmas looked different this year. Adelaide and Fleur did what cooking they could. Really great food was becoming hard to come by but the women did what they could to provide a decent holiday meal for the inhabitants of the safe house."Should we go around the table and say what we're thankful for? I feel like we haven't spoken much all night." Fleur spoke up softly, her hand slipping into her husbands to give him a loving squeeze.Bill smiled up at her and gave a nod. "I think that's a wonderful idea, darling.""What could we possibly be thankful for?" Ron scoffed."Ronald." Adelaide glared at him from across the table. Her hands were neatly folded together in her lap, but the moment Ron rolled his eyes at her she slammed them down on the table on either side of her plate. The blonde was staring daggers at the young redhead and ignored the hand on her arm to bring her back down to reality."Of course you have nothing to be grateful for, Ron. You left your best friends to fend for themselves on this bloody wild goose chase Dumbledore unleashed on you. Now I know that is not your fault, but you should have never left them. Nothing would ever make me leave Charlie, or Tonks, or even you in a time like this. Nothing!""Adelaide, you don't have any idea what you're talking about. So, I suggest you stop while you're ahead." Ron snapped back. He had pushed his chair back roughly, now standing opposite of her."You left them! They are supposed to be your best friends, Ron! Your family! How could you do that to them? What if they're hurt? Or worse?" Adelaide was visibly shaking now. She was angry and she was upset. She couldn't help but begin to think about the moment Sirius slipped into the veil with the last breath he'd ever gasp on this earth.Charlie's grasp tightened on Adelaide's arm. "Addy, leave him be." He whispered, begging the woman to stop her yelling. He could see that they both were upset, tears pooling in both of their eyes.Adelaide saw the tears in Ron's eyes through her own and immediately felt regret. "I-I'm sorry." She sighed, sitting back down, and grabbing hold of Charlie's hand. She looked at him for a moment before looking back at the rest of the table."I'm sorry for ruining dinner everyone."Ron sat down and rubbed his hands over his face. He was visibly frustrated, but it had already been a few days and he looked much better than when he first arrived. If it was dark magic, it was leaving his system and he was slowly becoming the old Ron Weasley again."I'm sorry, too." Ron spoke up, reaching forward and picking up his fork. He looked at his plate full of food before setting the fork back down. A part of him must have felt bad for enjoying a real meal while his best friends were out in the wilderness, doing Merlin knows what.Once the meal was finished, Adelaide followed Ron into the living room. She set herself on the armchair across from him, watching the way the flames of the fireplace lit up his features. He had less freckles than the rest of his siblings, atleast on his face, and Adelaide found herself pondering which parent he favored more."Is there something on my face?" Ron spoke up.Shit, he's caught me staring, Adelaide thought to herself, a soft sigh escaping her lips as she looked back to the flames."Sorry." She finally responded, nervously playing with the hem of her jumper. "I just... I'm sorry, Ron. I did not mean to attack you the way that I did at dinner." She apologized, glancing back to his face now. "I can't begin to imagine what you must be feeling...what you all have dealt with these past few months on the run. I'm sorry.""You don't have to apologize so much, Adelaide. It's okay, I understand. I-" Ron paused and shifted to get comfortable in his chair. "I'll tell you everything. But you have to promise me that you won't tell a single soul what I'm about to tell you here now." Ron glanced behind her, almost double checking to make sure the rest of his family was elsewhere, hopefully minding their own business.By the end of the discussion, Adelaide was floored. Her mouth had hung open for the entire time that Ron explained what Dumbledore and Harry were doing the night Dumbledore was killed, he went into even further detail about the journey he had taken with Harry and Hermione in order to find and destroy the rest of the so-called horcruxes.What sane individual, dark wizard or not, would split their soul in half – let alone seven different ways? Obviously Voldemort was not sane, and Adelaide knew that much, but it was still jarring to think about.Before going to bed, Adelaide made sure Ron knew how sorry she was for yelling at him but that her anger was technically in the right place. Ron agreed, surprisingly, and tried to figure out how to find Harry and Hermione again.They were in the middle of a comforting hug goodnight when there was a knock at the frame of the doorway. Pulling apart slowly, Adelaide looked over her shoulder to see Charlie standing there with a small smile. He didn't say anything, not wanting to interrupt any further than he already had, but he wanted to make sure Adelaide knew he was heading to bed."Goodnight Ron. We'll see you in the morning. Maybe with a good night's rest we can come up with a plan of how you can find them." Adelaide told him, pressing a motherly kiss to his cheek before she met Charlie in the doorway and slipped her hand in his.The two made their way upstairs and once the door was shut, providing privacy once more, Adelaide found herself pressed between the wood and Charlie. His forearms rested on the door on either side of her head as he stared down at her with a smirk."What? Why are you looking at me like that?""Is it weird that seeing you and how you act with my brother turns me on?"Adelaide snorted and playfully pushed at Charlie's chest. "What!? Charlie, you sound ridiculous. That's gross."Charlie laughed and rubbed at his chest as though she had hurt him. "I just meant that seeing you care is a turn on for me. Seeing how you are thinking of ways to help him... it means a lot to me."Adelaide wrapped her arms around Charlie's neck and tugged him down further until their lips met. The kiss lasted a few moments before she pulled back and gave him a smile."So, it's not me being angry and crazy that turns you on?" she teased him.Charlie chuckled. "Well, to be honest, it always has been a turn on. When you feel so strongly about something, no matter what it is, seeing that fire in you puts a fire in me."Adelaide instantly let her lips crash up against his again. The thing about Charlie is that he was never the best with words. He typically said things that pissed her off, especially when they were growing up, but now – things were different. Charlie learned from his mistakes. He learned how to put his true feelings into words and that was all it took for Adelaide to rip his clothes off and show him, physically, what he did to her.With confident hands, Adelaide unbuttoned Charlie's shirt before nudging him towards the bed. At the impact the mattress behind his knees, Charlie instantly collapsed into the bed. His eyes wide with anticipation and appreciation as Adelaide began to undress herself. She took her time, knowing that they were never in a rush to have one another.There was a war brewing outside of their window but inside, for both Charlie and Adelaide time stood still."Happy Christmas, Charlie." Adelaide giggled, playfully tugging down his trousers and what he wore underneath so that they were both completely bare. Once she climbed into his lap, her hands found their way into his hair, tugging his head back a bit. His hands on her bare waist drove her insane. The way his rough fingertips pressed into her skin, most likely leaving a mark for the hours, if not days, to follow.She could feel his erection between her legs and knew that he did not need any further foreplay to get ready to take her. As if he had read her mind, Charlie slipped a hand between her legs brushing against her most sensitive bud before dipping lower and finding her just as ready for him as he was for her. Keeping one hand firmly grasping her waist, Charlie helped ease her back down onto his hardened member.A soft moan escaped from her lips as her head fell back, taking her time in rolling her hips down into his to accommodate the size of him. Like any man, the sound of her moans fed his ego, stroking him to have even more confidence as he began moving her hips up and down against his own. He would do just about anything to hear her moans. The way her lips parted, just the slightest bit wet from her tongue. The way her eyes squeezed shut as she felt him continuously hit the sweetest spot within her."You are incredible, Addy." Charlie mumbled beneath his breath, his hands running up her back and tangling in her hair as it swung behind her shoulders. The tresses were almost long enough to tickle the tops of his thighs as her head was thrown back in ecstasy."Stop talking." She demanded, her eyebrows furrowed in concentration as her hips continued grinding down into his before she opened her eyes and looked down at him. She couldn't help but giggle at the feigned look of shock on his face.Charlie quickly flipped them around, his arms tightly wrapped around Adelaide's waist to keep their bodies still connected as he did so. The moment her back touched the bed, Charlie's hips began their rough descent into her. He knew when to follow directions, so he kept the talking to a minimum. His hands moved from her waist to the bed beneath her, keeping his body raised so he would not crush her. The way her fingernails scraped against his chest before grabbing onto his sides sent him into overdrive."Fuck, Charlie, you feel-"She was quickly cut off by the feeling of his lips roughly pressed against hers. He parted his lips in hopes that she would oblige him and let him taste her. So when her mouth opened against his, Charlie immediately pressed forward with his tongue, brushing against hers and enjoying the shiver that the taste of her sweet mouth sent down his spine."No talking." He whispered back to her once he broke away, his lips trailing down her jawline before nuzzling into the sensitive spot beneath her ear. She smelled amazing. A soft, natural scent that Charlie wanted to bathe himself in. He could, and would, never get enough of her.It wasn't long before Adelaide reached her high. Her legs tightened around Charlie's waist, keeping him close as she gyrated her hips up, enjoying the added pressure between her legs. Her mouth hung open, the room filled with heavy breathing and soft whimpers as Charlie's hips continued their relentless assault on hers. Her back arched, lifting her up from the mattress before she dropped back down with a moan the moment she felt Charlie reach his own high, spilling his warm seed inside of her.Catching his breath, Charlie slowly lowered himself until he was resting his weight fully against Adelaide. He knew she could handle the pressure of his body against hers, but eventually he slowly pulled out from between her legs so he could lay beside her, his head pressed into her chest. The erratic breathing and beating of their hearts began to slow, synching in rhythm as they stayed wrapped up in each other's arms."I still have to give you your present." She whispered, brushing the tip of her nose against his before pulling away completely to pull the delicately wrapped box from beneath the bed. She gestured for Charlie to sit up on the bed and tugged on her red silk robe before sitting back on her feet as she watched him pluck open the box with a grin.Inside the box was a large book on dragons – one Adelaide was sure Charlie had already read, if not atleast skimmed through, and a pair of flame retardant gloves."These are nice." Charlie held the gloves and inspected them."They're flame resistant, Charlie." Adelaide giggled and leaned into his side a bit as she took one glove from him and slid it onto her hand. She picked up her wand and glanced up at Charlie to make sure he was watching."Incendio."A small burst of fire shot from the tip of her wand and landed in her hand. The glove held the flame for a moment before she closed her hand around it, extinguishing the fire immediately."Bloody brilliant!" Charlie exclaimed, his lips twisting into a large grin before he immediately pulled the glove from Adelaide's hand and tossed it back into the box. He shoved the box to the ground, wincing when it made a loud bang, but soon recovered and pulled Adelaide onto his lap.With a girlish squeal, Adelaide grabbed onto Charlie's shoulders and looked down at him. "You understand why I gave you those, right?"Taking a moment to think about it, Charlie shook his head. "Actually, no.""This is me telling you that after all of this is done," Adelaide cupped his face in her hands and kissed his lips. "that if you want to go home to Romania, to the sanctuary, that I will not stand in your way. That whatever you want to do, whether it's staying here or moving back to Romania to be with your bloody dragons, I give you my full support."Charlie let his hand weave their way into her hair before he leaned up to kiss her lips once more. "That means more to me than you know, Addy." he whispered against her lips, letting his hands brush down her body, slipping beneath the folds of her robe so he could grab onto her bare skin. Relishing in the feeling of her soft skin beneath his calloused fingertips, Charlie pulled back just enough to look up at Adelaide again."But you, Adelaide Corden, you are my home."

F E B R U A R Y 1998"Where is Adelaide? There's been an attack at the Ministry."Bill's voice echoed throughout Shell Cottage. Fleur was scrambling to make her way up the stairs but only got halfway when she was met with a wide-eyed Charlie."Bill? What's happened?" Charlie stepped off the last step, eyes still wide as he stared over at his older brother. "Is Addy okay?"Charlie was already halfway to the fireplace with his jacket in hand before Bill stopped him."It's not Adelaide." A sorrowful look washed over Bill as he held onto his brother's shoulder. "It's Faustus and Adele."Fleur covered her mouth, standing behind the two as she tried to take in all the information Bill was throwing at Charlie. They had no idea what started it, but someone stood up to the Lestrange brothers and in the midst of it all, Faustus and Adele had gotten caught in the middle.Faustus was strong. He was a powerful wizard even though he rarely used his magic to do any sort of fighting. When his family was involved, though, it was a different story."Death Eaters followed them home. It's-"Bill paused to figure out the best way to put it. "It's not good, Charlie. Tonks and Remus are there now that things have calmed down.""What do you mean it's not good? Bill?" Charlie tugged his jacket on, preparing himself to use the floo to head over to St. Mungos. He was almost certain nobody else would oversee getting Adelaide and breaking the news to her except him. There was nobody better, besides Tonks, to handle this situation."Tonks believes they were tortured." Bill told him, a sigh escaping the eldest Weasley's lips before he continued, "And they're... They're dead, Charlie. They didn't make it."With this final blow, Charlie started to feel himself become a bit dizzy. How was he going to break this news to Adelaide? There was no way he could handle this. Atleast not by himself. His emotions were linked with Adelaide's. When she cried, he cried. When she was sad, he was sad. He was terrified that he couldn't be strong enough for her when she needed him to be."I- I can't tell her. I can't be that person. She... I can't do this, Bill." Charlie's eyes started filling with tears, his hands reaching up to brace himself on the mantle above the fireplace."You can do this, Charlie. And you will. You are the only person who she will want to be with when she finds out. Please don't let it be anyone else." Fleur stepped up, wiping her own tears away as she embraced her brother-in-law. "I know you love her, Charlie. She needs you."Charlie returned the hug weakly. Once they pulled apart, he turned to look back at Bill. "I don't know how long we'll be gone. Don't wait up for us, okay?"Bill nodded and took a step back to embrace his wife. He knew he'd have to travel to his Aunt Muriel's and break the news to the rest of the Weasley family.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇The moment Charlie stepped out of the floo in the atrium of St. Mungos he was greeted by healers and patients alike, scattered all over from wall to wall. There were many people being treated and it looked like the injuries, atleast from what he could see, were from dueling. He glanced around to see if he could spot Adelaide amongst the chaos and when he didn't, he started forward. Weaving his way through the crowd, Charlie knew what floor she normally worked on and started taking two, if not three, steps at a time. Luckily for him, with his long legs this wasn't too difficult.Rushing through the corridor once he made it to the seventh floor, Charlie barely paid any attention to what was going on around him. The only thing that made him stop in his tracks was the opening of the door a few paces in front of him. Adelaide stepped out, clutching a clipboard tightly in her arms as she shut the door behind her.The clipboard was soon out of her arms, nestled safely in its rightful spot just outside of the door. She was just about to go about her way before she was stopped by the sound of a throat being cleared behind her. Turning on her heel, Adelaide grinned widely once she saw that it was Charlie. She started to make her way towards him but stopped short when she noticed the look of sadness."Charlie?" she breathed out, a look of confusion washing over her face."Is there somewhere we can go? Privately?"He hated being short with her, especially when she seemed so happy to see him. But he couldn't break the news to her about her parents' death in the busy corridor of St. Mungos. Not to mention Charlie was a fairly well-known member of the order so with him being out in public like this, red hair on display for the world to see, he had to be exceptionally careful.Adelaide opened her mouth to respond, she wanted to know what had gotten him so down but decided to quickly close her mouth. She nodded and gestured for him to follow her quickly. The closest place she could find was the back staircase that most of the employees used to get in and out of the building."What is it? What's happened, Charlie? You're starting to scare me." Adelaide turned once the door shut behind them, looking up at Charlie with wide eyes."Why don't we sit down?" Charlie reached forward and held onto Adelaide so he could help direct her to sit down on the nearest step beside him.Adelaide let him move her body for her, her hands clasped together in her lap as she stared up at him."There was an attack at the ministry an-""My parents?" she cut him off, her voice already starting to break. She turned away from him, staring straight ahead to the wall before them. "Charlie? My parents?"Charlie was silent, not giving her a direct response, but shifted himself a bit closer to her. He slipped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her into his side."Charlie? Please answer me. It's my parents, isn't it?" she asked again."Yes." Charlie whispered, taking in a deep breath before continuing. "Something happened with the Lestrange brothers. Your father stood up for whoever they were targeting, and things escalated back to their home. Neither of them made it, Adelaide. I'm so sorry. I... I don't know what to say. Please tell me what to say."Adelaide remained silent. Shock took over and she immediately leaned into Charlie's chest as her silence ended with the beginning of her sobs. The tears were streaming down her cheeks, soaking the top of her uniform as she held onto Charlie for support. There was no hiding anything between the two friends. Charlie wore his emotions on his sleeve, he did not have the potential to have what you would call a poker face. He was like Adelaide in that sense. There could be no secrets between the two."Tonks and Remus are there now. Tell me what you want me to do. Addy, I'll do anything you tell me to." Charlie whispered down to her. His lips pressed against the top of her head as he cradled her against his chest. His heart was breaking not only for the loss of life of two people he cared for immensely, but also for watching the woman he loved go through this pain again.He knew the loss she suffered with Sirius was the first loss she had been dealt with. The death of her parents was different, more heart wrenching than he could ever imagine. While the loss of love was difficult, there was the option of moving on. Finding love again was possible, but after losing both parents in tragedy there was no coming back from that."Take me home." Adelaide whispered through her sobs. Her hands clutching his shirt tightly as he helped her stand. Her legs were weak and unstable, her body fell into his but lucky enough for her he was there to catch her.Charlie held her tightly, his hands moving to stroke her back lovingly before he started pulling away to look down at her. His hands cupped her cheeks as he looked down at her with nothing but love in his gaze. He helped her walk, providing support wherever she needed him, one arm wrapped firmly around her waist while his other hand moved to open the door so they could make their way back to the atrium to take the floo.She was in far too much distress to use apparition so the floo network was the safest route. The last thing they needed was Adelaide splinching herself.Adelaide lost all sense of time, starting the moment Charlie told her that her parents were dead. She was trying to count her breaths in hopes she would be able to keep herself grounded as best she could. But she was struggling, her eyes blurry with her tears as she held onto Charlie's waist, refusing to look up for fear that people would see how awful she looked. She knew that her eyes would already be red rimmed and puffy from crying, and her hands trembled clutching onto Charlie's shirt. Her blood pressure was surely through the roof – the feeling of dizziness slowly creeping up on her.Her eyes closed as she pressed into his side, letting him lead her into the fireplace as he called out for her family home.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇Charlie never left Adelaide's side as she said her goodbyes to her parents. There was not a dry eye in the room – Tonks and Remus lingered in the back holding onto each other for support as their friend grieved.With the war looming in the distance, closer than everyone could even imagine, Adelaide could not have a proper burial for her parents. No matter how painful it was, she knew she had to move on and do what she needed to make them proud of her.With the death eaters on the hunt for any, and all, order members, the ceremony was not what Adelaide would have wanted for her parents. They deserved to be alive, to live the end of their days in peace and love. Adelaide felt guilt over their passing. She knew there was no way she could have stopped this from happening. She could not save them – just as she could not save Sirius. The tears flowed free, soaking her face and the handkerchief Arthur had given her after he said a few words about his lifelong friends, Faustus and Adele.Adelaide, with Charlie by her side, was able to also say a few words. She held Charlie's hand tightly at her side, clutching the handkerchief from Arthur in the other."My parents were wonderful people. Caring and loving." She began softly, clearing her throat to try and make sure her voice did not waver. "Being an only child had the benefits of getting their full, undivided attention for most of my life. Even as an adult, they nurtured me and cared for me as they did when I was just a child."Throughout her speech, Tonks had to sit down, both hands resting on her swollen pregnant belly as her husband stood behind her with his hands on her shoulders for support. Tonks was usually not an emotional person, so this was chalked up to pregnancy hormones.Once the house was empty again, even Remus and Tonks having gone back home, Adelaide sat on the edge of her childhood bed, eyes shut as her head rested against the wooden post. Charlie had cleaned up the downstairs before making his way outside to strengthen the wards that he, Remus, and Bill had put up.It was unknown if Adelaide would stay there or return to Shell Cottage. After all, she did not want to forget about the house that built her into the grown woman that she was today. There were so many good memories within these walls – and if they could talk, Adelaide knew she would be blushing furiously when all her secrets became exposed.So many sleepless nights with Tonks in the summertime. Laying on her bed and giggling about gossip. About Charlie.At the sound of the door opening, Adelaide let her eyes flutter open before she turned to look at the figure standing in the doorway."Do you need me to do anything?" Charlie stepped forward and sat down beside her, reaching forward to take both of her hands in his. He brought them to his lips, and he kissed her knuckles gently before letting go."Can we lay here for a little bit?"Charlie gave her a small smile and a nod before he shifted around and tugged her down with her. His arms encased her protectively, holding her close to his side as soon as his head hit the pillow.Adelaide wasn't sure how much time had passed but the moment she noticed a change in the shade of light streaming through the window, she shifted to lean up so she could look down at Charlie. She felt like she had no more tears left in her body. It was a weird feeling, and she tried her best to blink and not let her eyes dry up."Charlie?""Yes?"Charlie looked up at her once he felt her start to move. His arms loosened slightly, wanting to keep her close to him. He knew she needed this."Did I ever tell you about the sleepover I had with Tonks where I-"she paused, a soft laugh escaping from her lips before she continued, "Actually, I'm sure I never told you because I'm getting embarrassed just thinking about it." She leaned her head back against his chest.Charlie chuckled, "Well, you've certainly piqued my interest now, Addy. You can't not tell me now!""Well, I think it was summer going into our fifth year at Hogwarts. Tonks stayed the night, and it was the summer I realized I most definitely had a crush on you. A very, tiny...little crush." Adelaide found herself smiling at the memories. Her cheeks warmed at the admission of when her crush on him had started. "And well, I think I must have talked about you all night long. But you know Tonks, she was barely listening. She was too busy writing down all her joke ideas in my journal. She didn't want her Mum to find it. Anyway..." she started to trail off, almost fighting with herself about whether or not she should really continue with this specific story. She knew the outcome. She knew what she wanted to tell him.Charlie found himself smiling widely as he listened to Adelaide recount the memory. The butterflies in his stomach were turning into something more serious. This was a feeling he was familiar with. Familiar with Adelaide, and only her."By the end of my rant about how beautiful your eyes and hair were, Tonks finally started paying attention and she had the audacity to ask me what I was going to tell you about being in love with your brother!" At this point in her story, Adelaide was starting to laugh. The memory helped wipe the dark cloud that had been looming over her head away and she moved again to look down at him.Charlie laughed. "Bill? Tonks thought you were in love with Bill?""Yes! She's crazy!" Adelaide giggled and absentmindedly started playing with the strands of his hair. Shifting all her attention on his face now. Her smile lingered for another moment or two before she finally met his gaze. "But at the end of it all, she was right about one thing."Charlie raised a brow, "Oh? About what?" He inquired."The fact of the matter was that I was in love." Adelaide's voice came out low. She kept his gaze, letting her fingertips graze against the side of his head, pushing his hair back from his forehead. "But it was most certainly not with Bill."Charlie fell silent as the conversation quickly took a sharp turn into being serious. He wasn't going to coax any more information out of her. If she wanted to continue, she would do it on her own time. What he did do, though, was tighten his arms around her with one hand rested on her hip while the other snaked down her lower backside.Adelaide enjoyed the feeling of Charlie's arms around her. She leaned down and quickly pressed her lips against his before pulling back up. She didn't move too far away, though, as her forehead rested down against his."It was you, Charlie."The feeling in the pit of her stomach was intense. She was almost terrified of how he would react to her confession of being in love with him. She cupped the side of his face and waited for him to react. His eyes had never left hers, but she was starting to get worried about his silence."I love you." She whispered again, sitting up and looking down at her lap.Charlie immediately followed her movements, his arms no longer wrapped around her once she got up to sit. He watched her with a smile growing wide on his lips. This was the moment he had been thinking about for so long and he could sense that Adelaide had been waging a war with herself about whether to tell him or keep it secret for just a little bit longer."I love you, too." He finally responded, his hands moving over to grab hers but kept them connected in her lap. "I think I might have loved you for just as long as you've loved me."Turning to look up at Charlie the moment his hands grabbed hers, Adelaide felt the release of all her worries. Her eyes fell shut as she took in a deep breath before looking back at him once more."Why did it take us so long?""Well, for starters... I'm quite dumb." Charlie teased. A laugh escaped his mouth before he leaned over and brought her hands to his mouth, pressing delicate kisses along her knuckles before looking back at her. "So, with that being said, I take full responsibility.""Good, I'm glad because I blame you, too." The blonde teased back at him. She pulled her hands from his grip only to launch herself into his arms, straddling his lap and holding herself against him tightly. She was trying to push down the guilt over Sirius, but she knew that not everyone spent their whole lives with their true soul mates. Right now, wrapped up in one another, Adelaide decided that Charlie Weasley was, and always will be, her one true soulmate.If she believed in reincarnation – which she did not - she knew that in each new life, just like the one before, she would spend her days with Charlie by her side.

April 1998Adelaide was barely getting by after the death of her parents. It took her one full week to make any big decision about the house but eventually she decided to stay in Shell Cottage. She didn't need convincing, not really. After all her parents were murdered in cold blood in the house and it was all she could think about anytime she stepped foot outside of her bedroom.Gone were the good memories, both the old and the new. Her childhood bedroom was a safe space, though. The place where she realized her love for Charlie when they were kids. The same place, as adults, where she finally told him how she felt - how much she loved him. She felt protected once the door was shut, but she knew it was not healthy to stay in one room the way she did the past week.She grabbed a few valuable possessions, protected them with charms in a lockbox Arthur had given to her, and brought it with her as she traveled back to Shell Cottage.Charlie was waiting for her by the front door, which did not surprise her. She smiled as she watched him rush forward to greet her. His arms enveloped her body tightly, protectively holding onto her as his lips pressed against the top of her head."Can I be honest?" He questioned. His voice slightly muffled by her hair as he refused to pull away even by a quarter of an inch."Always, Charlie.""I do not think I can ever let you out of my sight. Do you think I can shrink myself so that you can keep me in your pocket at work?" He teased, a laugh escaping his lips, shaking his chest as he finally pulled back to look down at her."You are so strange, Charlie. I don't think that will work." She giggled, shaking her head for a moment before she slipped her hands onto his face. She leaned up on the tips of her toes and pressed her lips against his. She was firm with her touch, wanting to show him just how much she cared for him. "I have good news, I guess." She whispered against his lips. Now she was the one refusing to part from him."Good news?" He pulled back to look down at her, his eyes wide with a puzzled look on his face."Well, only that Kingsley spoke with Tonks. He says I should just stop showing up to work." She sighed initially, chewing on her bottom lip while deep in thought. "And at first I was upset. But they've been doing some undercover raids and think I should be available at any given moment to assist for any healing needs."Charlie let out a breath, one that he had been holding since she told him she had good news."I know you're upset. I know your work means a lot to you. Trust me I know exactly how you feel." Charlie smiled, cupping her face in his hands now before leaning down to pepper kisses along her face, starting with her forehead and ending with her lips. "But this has been a long time coming. It's the safest route until this is all over." He whispered, rubbing the sides of his thumbs against her cheekbones before pulling away completely."Come, let's get inside." He nodded to the open door and grabbed her hand before making his way back into the cottage. They had only been back inside for a few minutes before a large silvery whisp of a wolf patronus entered the room. Tonks' strained voice echoed through the room with a message for Adelaide, exclaiming that the baby was "bloody on his or her way and that you needed to get your arse there instantly".No words needed to be shared between the two, Adelaide instantly dropped the kettle back onto the stove and rushed to the fireplace with Charlie in tow. She rushed forward out of the fireplace as soon as they were transported into the Tonks family home."Mrs. Tonks!" Adelaide greeted the soon-to-be grandmother with a smile, giving her a kiss on each cheek before stepping back and let Charlie do the same."It's very heartwarming to see the two of you finally together." Andromeda whispered to Charlie the moment she stepped back from the hug."Thank you." Charlie chuckled softly, a light red tint surely spreading across his cheeks as he glanced over at Adelaide who was watching the two curiously."Ah! You made it. She's in a rut, Addy." Remus called from the top of the stairs, peering down to spot the new arrivals."I told her I'd help bring this baby into the world, I would never go back on that promise! She would haunt me for the rest of my life, surely." Adelaide laughed and made her way up the stairs to join them, Andromeda right behind her after ensuring Charlie was comfortable downstairs.Even with the impending birth of the first grandchild, Andromeda was forlorn with the recent loss of her husband, Ted. Just like Adelaide's parents, though instead he had chosen to be on the run once Voldemort gained power over the Ministry, as killed the month before by a group of snatchers.Upon entering Adelaide's entrance to the room, Tonks looked up and the moment her eyes laid on her best friend her hair turned the bright bubblegum pink color she had not spotted in a while."How are you feeling?" Adelaide knelt beside her and pressed a quick kiss to her forehead. She brushed back sweaty strands of hair and looked over at Remus who was just about as pale as a ghost. He was holding onto the bed post for support, almost as though he was about to keel over and die on the spot. Adelaide would not allow that, of course.She reached into her bag, more than half of her whole arm disappearing beneath the rim as she dug in and around the hidden extendable charm. She finally found what she was looking for and pulled out the small blue vial. "Rem, this is for you."The expectant father shook his head. "No, I'm okay. I don't need it.""Remus Lupin, if you don't take that vial from Addy's hands this instance, I swear I will kick you out of this room at once!"Adelaide laughed at her friend's outburst, her eyes pleading silently with Remus to take the calming draught. Knowing when not to put up a fight, especially with his wife who was currently dealing with labor pains, Remus took it the vial and downed the contents before handing it back to Adelaide.Once the calming draught took effect, Remus visibly relaxed and was the best birthing partner he could be for his wife. For the first time in her life, Adelaide helped her best friend give birth to her first born child, a son.Born in the late morning hours of this beautiful spring day, a beautiful baby boy with hair as black as the night sky. Edward Remus Lupin, to be known affectionately as "Teddy", made his entrance with a loud scream, and Adelaide could not have guessed it to be any different. After all, her mother was the loudest person she had ever met.She assisted with cleaning Teddy up after Tonks was able to cuddle him against her bare chest. Andromeda was on her right and Remus on her left and there was not a single dry eye in the room."You did so wonderfully, my sweet girl." Andromeda whispered to her daughter, still smiling with tears streaming down her cheeks as the name that was chosen."He is absolutely perfect." Remus joined in, "Just like his mum.""You two don't need to kiss my arse, you know. I still love you even though you're the reason I went through all of that pain." Tonks teased her husband, grinning up at Adelaide who swaddled Teddy protectively in a blanket before handing him back to his mother."Charlie here?""Yes. He's downstairs. Do you want me to get him?"Tonks nodded. Adelaide stepped out into the hall and quickly cast a scourgify charm over herself to clean up because she traveled down the stairs, finding Charlie lingering in the kitchen with a biscuit hanging out of his mouth, the latest copy of the daily prophet on his hands.Sneaking up behind him, though not being completely silent, Adelaide slipped her hands up his back, over his shoulders and onto his chest. "What are you reading?" She asked, her lips brushing against his ear as she leaned in against him over the chair he was seated in.Charlie bit down on the biscuit, crumbs surely landing on Adelaide's hands before he set the paper down and dropped the other half of the biscuit on the plate. "Hmm." He finished chewing and swallowed, turning just a bit to press his crumb-covered lips against her cheek."You're a child, Charles Weasley." She cried with a laugh, jumping back from him, and brushing her cheek off. "But, anyway," she grinned widely now, "speaking of children...""It sounded like a war zone up there. Did Lupin faint? I swore I heard a bang!" Charlie teased again, turning to face her with his hands outstretched to her. Adelaide stepped in between his legs, slipping her hands along the sides of his neck before she leaned down and kissed his lips softly."What was that for? You want to make a baby with me? Right here? Right now?" He smirked against her lips, his hands resting on her backside as he held her close to him."Charlie!" Adelaide laughed softly, shaking her head once more. "Stop! I'm trying to tell you that the baby upstairs is absolutely breathtaking and that he wants to meet his Uncle Charlie."Charlie stood, his arms still holding onto her. "Well, why didn't you say so?" He teased, pecking her lips gently before their hands connected and he followed up the stairs after her. ◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇ The moment Charlie held the little bundle of joy, Adelaide felt weak, completely, in the knees. She sat by the window that overlooked Andromeda's garden, listening in on the conversations that were being held around her."I should have known you would get him to stop crying." Tonks chuckled, her hair now a bright shade of pink again. She was truly at her happiest when her hair was pink, atleast that's what Adelaide assumed.Charlie was rocking Teddy back and forth, gently patting his bottom as he did so. "Ah, well, you can't blame me. I'm the second eldest of seven bloody kids. I have had plenty of practice.""You hear that Ad-" The metamorphagus was cut off by her husband who quickly raised his voice about stopping home to make sure it was tidied up to bring Teddy home.Adelaide chose to ignore what she knew Tonks was about to say, though she did stand and tell Remus she would walk downstairs with him. She stopped by the bed to plant a kiss on Tonks' forehead before doing the same to both Charlie and Teddy.Once the bedroom door was shut and she followed Remus along the hallway, she finally spoke up. "I think your wife is trying to hint at something. Don't you?"Remus smirked, "Ah, yes, she has never been one to shy away from what she really wants to say. No matter who she makes uncomfortable.""I don't think I'll ever hear the end of it." Adelaide laughed and started down the staircase side by side with Remus. "It's my own fault, really. She knows my deepest, darkest secrets."Remus stepped up to the fireplace and turned to face her. "You deserve to be happy." He told her with a smile. "It's the truth, and it's something you need to start getting used to. Take it from poor old me. As of today, i have everything I never believed I would ever have, or ever deserved.""Oh Remus." Adelaide wrapped her arms around him, hugging him tightly and leaving a friendly kiss on his cheek as she stepped back. "Thank you, truly. I think it may just take me some time to forgive myself.""Forgive yourself? For what?""For allowing myself to be happy. For-" the petite blonde turned to look away from Remus, a blush creeping up her neck at the realization that she would have to speak into existence the feelings she had dealt with for the past few years. "For being in love with two men at the same time."Remus stayed silent and as she turned back to look at him, she could not see any shock or judgment on his face."How long have you been feeling this guilt?" He suddenly asked her, wanting to help her talk through her guilt and pain."The moment Charlie came back into my life." She cried softly, covering her face with both of her hands before she looked back at Remus."Listen, I'm only going to say this one time. And one time only," Remus paused, reaching forward to grab her hands and hold them gently in his own. "You are not a bad person. For the feelings you had, no matter what you think of yourself, you are just like the rest of us." He told her, smiling weakly. "Sirius- Well, he knew. He knew you loved Charlie and he was okay with that. He understood you had a history. Everyone has a past. Even though he was a jealous man, he understood."All it took was Remus saying Sirius' name for the waterworks to begin. She sobbed softly at first before he enveloped her in his arms and held her in a protective embrace. They stayed that way for a few more minutes before Adelaide pulled back and wiped her tears away."Thank you, Remus. Thank you." She bid him farewell with kiss on each cheek before watching him step into the green flames to head home.She sniffled just a bit and wiped at her face before turning to head back up the steps. She kept her eyes on the floor before her but the moment she reached the top step she noticed a pair of feet and looked up to find Charlie standing there.Before she could speak, he cupped her face in his hands and pulled her closer. His lips pressed dominantly against hers, his fingers spreading wide across her cheeks, slowly sinking into her messy blonde hair to keep a good hold on her. The kiss was as slow as it was passionate. His lips parted so he could pry hers open. He let his tongue press through – tasting her, savoring the sweetness he took from her.Once they parted, Adelaide cleared her throat."What was that about?""Nothing. Just wanted you to know that I love you."She could tell he had most likely heard, atleast the tail end, of the conversation she had with Remus. She stayed silent, watching him with nothing but admiration. She leaned up, grasping his shoulders as she kissed him again."I love you, too."

A P R I L 1998The first day of May was just around the corner and Adelaide found herself worried about whether Harry, Hermione, and Ron were okay. There had been absolutely no communication with the trio and this absolutely broke Remus, now one of the only remaining fatherly figures in the boy's life, so naturally he felt compelled to do whatever he could to honor the love and friendship he had with his father, James, and ask Harry to be Teddy's godfather. He told Tonks he knew Harry would accept with no questions asked, even without meeting his godson beforehand.Adelaide could not have agreed more on Remus' decision. Harry was an excellent choice and to be quite honest, she told Tonks that if Remus had chosen anyone else her acceptance of being offered the role of Godmother would have been extremely different."How is the babe?" Fleur looked up from her steaming mug of tea, a small smile appearing on her lips."He is wonderful. Truly. He is the sweetest little thing and has me wrapped around his little finger already." Adelaide sighed happily at the thought of little Teddy. It left her awestruck at the constantly changing looks of a baby. Being a metamorphagus aside, the looks of a newborn baby are always changing. One day, Teddy looked like his mother and the next, his father. It was remarkable."Have you ever thought of children, Adelaide?" Fleur pried as nonchalantly as possible.The blonde peered up at the girl across from her, a laugh escaping her lips. "Fleur, you know you are as subtle as...well, as subtle as your Mum-in-law." Adelaide started playing with the ends of her hair that Fleur had tied back in a braid for her earlier in the day."Yes, well, maybe that's why we clashed so much in the beginning of my relationship with Bill." Fleur admitted with a laugh. "You didn't answer my question.""Of course, I've thought of children. Not as much now as I did before, though." The healer sighed before getting up to clean out her mug that was now empty."You mean, you've thought of children with Sirius but not with Charlie?"Adelaide sighed. She glanced over at the clock, realizing it was too early for this type of interrogation, but it was also early enough that they had some more time alone without the men waking up and making their way down into the kitchen."That's not it." Adelaide replied, scrunching up her nose a bit at the insinuation that she didn't want children, or a life, with Charlie. "I love Charlie. With all my heart, and I have done so for so many years. Since we were kids ourselves, really." She found herself smiling at the memory of when she finally figured out what she felt for Charlie was love."I think first losing Sirius made me realize that the future was always going to be unpredictable. With the Dark Lord and the war on the horizon, I felt terrified of the thought of welcoming new life that would only be shadowed by death."Fleur seemed to have been taken back by the seriousness of Adelaide's response. She reached over the table and grabbed onto the healers hands with a smile. "You would not be the only one with those concerns. To be honest, sometimes I feel that way, too. But then I look at Bill and think that I cannot wait to have children with him. The practicing won't hurt either.""The practicing?" Adelaide paused for a moment before slapping Fleur's hands away playfully. "Oh! You're naughty." She giggled as the meaning of Fleur's words finally dawned on her."I know. I'm French, it's in our blood." Fleur smirked playfully, now getting up from the table to clean out her own mug. Just as she was returning to the table, footsteps were heard clearly on the staircase behind them.Adelaide looked up and smiled warmly as Charlie's face came into view."You ladies are awake early." He leaned down to kiss Adelaide's forehead in a quick greeting before he started to make his own cup of tea."We had gossip to discuss. We cannot possibly do that with you men sniffing about, you know." Adelaide teased, leaning over to him once he took the seat beside her at the table. She pressed her lips against his cheek while her hand rested on his thigh. "I didn't get a chance to tell you last night, but Tonks and Remus asked me to be Teddy's godmother."Charlie smiled down at her. The way she was beaming at the mention of Teddy's name melted Charlie's heart quicker than dragon fire ever could. "I still can't believe Tonks, our Tonks, is a mum." He chuckled before going to drink his tea.Adelaide leaned her head against his upper arm, holding his hand in hers. Absentmindedly she ran her fingertips along the back of his hand before turning it around and tracing the lines in his palm."Enough canoodling at the kitchen table, you two." Bill groaned as he strolled in, greeting his wife with a kiss before making a beeline for the counter to start making his tea and a piece of toast."We'll take it upstairs then." Charlie announced."Charlie!" Adelaide cried with a laugh, smacking his chest playfully before she looked at Fleur, who shot her a wink.Each day she smiled and laughed more than the last. Each day was a step further away from the painful day she had lost her parents. She had not stepped foot back in the house since the day she came back to Shell Cottage on the day Teddy was born.There was something calming about the gentle lapping of ocean waves just outside their bedroom window that made Adelaide feel at home here. At peace, almost. And Charlie sleeping next to her, his arms wrapped protectively around her every night, was just a bonus.It only took a few minutes, but Charlie finished his tea, stole a piece of Bill's toast, and dragged Adelaide up the stairs to their room. He shut the door and locked it out of habit, smiling down at the blonde with the slice of toast hanging from his lips."You're an animal, Charlie. You're getting crumbs everywhere." She tried to be stern, though giggles soon escaped her lips as he ripped through half of the piece of toast before feeding her the other half."See? Now you're half to blame for the crumbs.""Cheeky." She mumbled through chewing the toast, nudging him with her elbow before she made her way to the open window."After this is over," Charlie spoke up from behind her. His hands reached around her, hooking her around his arms before he pulled her back against his chest. "Do you want to live by the ocean?"Adelaide smiled weakly. She would have to be honest with him about her doubts and it pained her. But she knew she had to tell him, especially if something were to happen. She needed him to know that no matter what she loved him unconditionally."Charlie, I haven't thought about the future for a while. I love you, so very much, but I don't want to get my hopes up.""What do you mean?""What if I die? Or what if you do? What if he wins and we have to stay in hiding for the rest of our lives?""Please stop being so pessimistic. I'm begging you." He whispered into her ear, his lips brushing against her neck as he nuzzled into her with a sigh. "I hate seeing you like this. We'll be okay. We'll get through this. Together. I promise you.""But you can't promise something like that. You can't." She whispered back to him.Charlie could tell that she had begun crying by the sound of her voice. He held her tighter, kissing the side of her neck comfortingly before he held her waist, turning her around so he could look down at her. He knew Sirius had made a promise to her of the same magnitude. He needed her to know that he wasn't just saying this to help her feel better in the moment. He meant it. He knew the future was unknown, and that so many different things could happen to change their lives for the worst, but he had high hopes that one day he would be sitting in the sand with Adelaide by his side, their children playing in the waves with their cousins."I love you, Adelaide Corden. So very fucking much." Charlie told her sternly, his hands moving up to cup her face firmly before he leaned down and pressed his lips against hers. She responded immediately, her hands slipping beneath his shirt to run against the smooth skin on his lower back before pushing further up and running over scars from various work mishaps.Bloody fucking dragons."Show me." She whispered against his lips, parting just long enough to speak those two words before her lips connected to his again once more. Her backside was perched on the windowsill, the cool morning air hitting her skin as she felt Charlie start removing her shirt.She let him undress her, her hands reluctantly moving from his back so the shirt could be removed before she tugged his own off so she could go right back to feeling his skin beneath her fingertips.There was one scar in particular that she found herself brushing against, memories of him laid out on his kitchen table at the dragon sanctuary in Romania. In that moment, when they carried him inside, she was terrified that he was hurt more than he was, and that broke her heart in that she should have been thinking about Sirius when all she could be bothered with was whether Charlie would live and be in her life.Neither of them could be bothered with the fact that they were almost hanging out of the window. Adelaide kept her hands firmly on Charlie's sides as she felt him press closer between her legs. She playfully took his bottom lip in between her teeth, tugging it down as she tilted her head back. As she let go, a soft sensual moan escaped her lips as he entered her slowly. Painfully, in a good way, slow."Charlie." She breathed out, her head hanging back still as he bottomed out inside of her. His hands were holding onto her hips, keeping her pressed between the windowsill and his hips. She instinctively wrapped her legs around his waist to keep herself bolted to him. The feeling of him filling her mixed with the salty air whipping her hair around sent chills down her spine.As Charlie began pumping his hips back and forth into her, Adelaide felt herself begin to let go. She let go of every worry, and every fear that had been plaguing her mind. Her hands trembled against his chest before she grabbed onto his neck and pulled him down so she could kiss him. She could barely continue with the kiss as another soft mewl left her lips as he repeatedly hit the sweetest spot inside of her."Fuck. Bloody hell, Ads, you feel incredible." He whispered down to her, slowing his hips for a moment only long enough for him to hoist her up and away from the window. He carried her towards the bed and was about to drop her down before she whispered for him to lay down first.He did as she commanded him to, turning around so that he could sit down on the edge of the mattress, keeping himself inside of her as she straddled his waist. Her hands pressed into his chest, and she started moving her hips against him the moment his back hit the mattress.She was lost in the feeling of him beneath her, fingertips brushing against his chest before she leaned down to kiss his lips, stifling the moans that were threatening to escape both of their mouths. His hands held her backside, helping her move up and down on top of him.After a few more moments of this, Adelaide slowly pulled back from his lips. She looked down at him with a soft smile. "Charlie?" She asked, her hips coming to a complete stop as she waited for him to respond.He wanted to move her hips for her once she stilled above him. He opened his eyes fully, looking up at her. "Yes?" He whispered back, slightly breathless now."I want to have your children." She told him, "You know that right? You know I want you for the rest of my life, don't you?"Charlie raised a brow at the seriousness of her words. His hands ran along her back for a moment before finding themselves back against her hips once more. "Of course I know that, love. And I want you to have my children." He moved one hand to her lower stomach, biting back on his bottom lip for a moment before he flipped them over so that her back was pressed into the mattress.He held her legs apart, pressing her knees down as his hips started drilling into her. He didn't know the word for it, or maybe subconsciously he did, but the sound of her whispering about wanting his babies made him grow even harder. His hips were relentless with their movements and the moment he slipped his thumb along the sensitive swollen bundle of nerves between her legs, the rest was history.It had never been this good. He could feel her walls clenching down, contracting around him as she reached her orgasm at the exact same moment that he reached his. His hips slowed but did not stop completely until he had nothing left to give her. He shifted to pull back and out from between her legs, his body collapsing down beside her on the bed.They laid in silence, though their heavy breathing the only sound that could be heard bouncing between the four walls that surrounded them. Charlie slowly brushed his fingertips along her stomach, circling her navel before shifting to her side, pulling her against his chest.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇M A Y 1998The next day, the last afternoon hours began dwindling down slowly altering the light across the sky into darkness.Adelaide chewed on her bottom lip as she stared out at the ocean. Now that the sky was getting darker, it was hard to discern where the ocean ended and where the sky began. It was hauntingly beautiful. She wrapped the thin shawl around her shoulders as she took in a deep breath. It was getting harder to shake the uneasiness within. Something was just on the horizon – she could feel it.When she heard the back door slamming open, footsteps rapidly approaching her from behind, she turned and was met with Charlie. The redhead was wide eyed and panting, his hands reaching for hers as he brought her closer to him and further from the calming lap of waves."It's happening. We have to go." 

When Adelaide stepped back into Hogwarts, hand clasped tightly in Charlie's, memories of the last time she was here rushed through her. It was extremely overwhelming.Sirius, the shrieking shack, the dead body of Cedric Diggory, the wails of a grieving father...And now - War.She knew this was the end. The end for what side, though, was still unknown. The entire Order stepped through the doors of the Great Hall, Severus Snape escaping at the last minute, the students cheering - this brought her out of the daze. The collective cheering of everyone around her removed the painful memories from the forefront of her mind and brought her back to reality."I don't want you getting involved in the fighting."Adelaide turned to look up to Charlie, a frown forming on her lips. "Charlie, that's not fair. I'll have you know that I am a very capable witch.""Yes, I know that." He let go of her hand to cup the side of her face before planting a firm kiss on her lips. "But you are an even better healer." He pulled back and smiled down at her. The pad of his thumb brushed against her cheek as he held her close to him."You're lucky I agree with you." She teased playfully, leaning up quickly to kiss him once more. Adelaide was going to kiss him as much as she could. She knew they would be separated. She would hide within the castle, healing those who needed it with Madam Pomfrey by her side. Atleast, that was what they planned on doing."That's enough you two. Don't want to lose my lunch." Fred smirked, weaving his way between his older brother and Adelaide, wrapping his arms around them both."Good to see you, Fred. Or is it, George? You know, I could never tell the difference." Adelaide smirked."Oi!" George called out from his spot besides Ginny, "I heard that!"Fred laughed, "I, Fred Weasley, am the better looking one. You'd better remember that!" He walked over to his twin again, giving Adelaide a wink over his shoulder as he went."Ah, yes, how could I ever forget?" Adelaide called with a laugh. She turned her attention back to Charlie and only had another moment with him before Kingsley pulled him away to talk strategy.Adelaide made eye contact with Remus and gave him a slow nod before she turned and was met with Poppy."We might be able to get a head start in gathering supplies from the infirmary before anything big happens. Come. Make haste." Poppy snapped her fingers, already rushing through the open doors of the great hall without a second glance. Adelaide rushed after her, tying her hair back in a tight bun as she went.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇Once she had gathered supplies and stashed things in the Great Hall, she followed Molly and the others outside, listening in on conversations of those around her to take her mind from Charlie – she had no clue where he was right now."To blow it up? You know, boom?" Neville Longbottom scurried alongside McGonagall, his eyes wide as he followed her."Boom!" She repeated, lifting the skirts of her robes a bit as they walked down the steps."Wicked!" Neville smirked a bit, glancing back at Seamus who was right behind him. "But uh, Professor, how on earth are we going to do that?"Now McGonagall found herself smiling. She looked at Neville before glancing quickly at Seamus. "Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnegan here? From what I remember, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics."Seamus beamed, "Oh, aye, I can bring it down!""Off you go!"Adelaide watched as the two boys – really, after tonight they could be called two young men – rush off and away from the steps.She reached forward and grabbed Molly's hand.Everything around them would be in ruin. And soon.The castle walls shook with McGonagall's loud cast of Piertotum Locomotor. She brought to life the solid knights etched into the walls above the great hall - something Adelaide did not think she would ever see in her lifetime. Her wand stayed at the ready, though it was shoved tightly through her bun, it was atleast out of the way but close enough to grab in a pinch. Her priority was to take care of any of the injured. Not to mention, stay alive while doing so.Her hand never left Molly's, and the matriarch gave her a tight squeeze as they stared up in awe of the large knights marching forward."Hogwarts is threatened!" McGonagall exclaimed loudly, "Man the boundaries! Protect us! Do your duty to our school!"Adelaide was in complete awe of the power McGonagall revealed. Her eyes wide as she leaned into Molly's side.McGonagall was quite pleased with herself. She looked over at Molly and Adelaide and smiled, "Oh, I always wanted to use that spell!"Molly, while a bit uneasy, turned to look at Adelaide. "Charlie will never forgive me if you are out here. You must go back inside.""Molly, I will be okay for right now." Adelaide sighed, "And after all... the inside of the castle may not always be safe. Not tonight."She let go of Molly's hand and stepped forward. She watched Flitwick and Slughorn raise their wands and knew that the more magic, the better. She reached up and back, tugging her wand out from her bun. She raised her hand in the air and began the incantation alongside the professors who shaped her into the magnificent witch that she was today."Protego Maxima Fianto Duri Repello Inimicum."Blueish white light shot from the wands of each person who stood strong, repeating the incantation repeatedly until the protective barrier was completing surrounding Hogwarts. Adelaide slowly lowered her wand for a moment, taking in a deep breath as she watched the barrier create a bubble around them. She tucked her wand back into her hair and turned to look at Molly, who was already looking at her.She was about to speak when spell after spell began attacking the barrier. She went to reach for her wand again, but Molly grabbed onto her elbow, stopping her. "Go inside. Now!"Adelaide felt much like a child, though she knew she would be of much better use to everyone alive than dead. And she would admit that she was not a great dueler. She opened her mouth to argue but realized she knew better than to argue with Molly Weasley."I love you, Molly. You have always treated me like one of your own and for that, I will eternally be grateful.""You are one of my own, Adelaide. Now go! Get in!" Molly kissed the girl's cheek and shooed her away inside the castle.Adelaide rushed in, mixing right into the chaos of the students running around. She did what she could help direct everyone and just as she went to turn away from one young Hufflepuff, she ran directly into the chest of the boy who lived."Harry!" she gasped, griping onto the boy's jacket tightly and giving him a tight hug before letting go."Adelaide!" Harry hugged her in return, "Please be careful. Look after Ginny for me. Please." And with that, the boy who lived was gone.She stood in shock over the quick reunion before turning back around and rushing through the corridor to find Ginny. Luckily, it did not take her long at all. She took her hand tightly and helped her through the chaos, "Come Ginny! We must get you further inside the castle. It's not safe out here!"The girls rushed through the corridors, making their way back to the Great Hall. It was hard to think of anything other than the war waging just outside the doors. The walls started to crumble with each spell that smacked against the castle, fires burning the grounds of majestic Scotland. Destroying what she loved so much about Hogwarts.The death eaters and other Lord Voldemort supporters breached the castle walls. The sanctuary that they had hoped for did not exist. Adelaide helped Ginny hide away with other younger students before she found herself grabbing at her wand and shooting off protection charms in every direction. She was good for that much."Is that a fucking giant?" she cried, to no one in particular. The ground shook beneath her, causing her to lose her footing for a moment. She braced herself against the wall and took in a deep breath. With each moment that passed her by, she could only think of Charlie. Was he already dead? Was he hiding somewhere, hurt? Where was he in the castle? She just wanted to be by his side.For right now, she knew it was not safe for her to stay in one spot. She rushed through the halls with the rest of the crowd, hands trembling as she held onto her wand tightly. She heard a familiar voice cry out and her blood ran cold, sending chills straight down her body all the way into the tips of her fingers. Her eyes caught Hermione, Ron, and Harry rushing through the destruction and sticking close to one another. Hermione cast a spell to throw Fenrir Greyback through the wall, away from a student he had been hunched over, feasting on her flesh in grotesque fashion.Adelaide gasped and rushed forward towards the girl. By the time she knelt beside her and checked for a pulse, she could see the blood pouring out from the wound in her neck. She was gone."Fuck." She cried softly, still feeling intense sadness over the loss of a life even if it was one she did not know. She reached down and gently closed the eyelids of Greyback's victim.She let her feet take control, not thinking of where to go next. She saw a familiar redhead and rushed to chase after the figure, finding herself nearing the clock tower courtyard. She caught the tail-end of an explosion, a loud gasp escaping her lips as she thought Neville had perished. The group of students that included Ginny and Seamus, the only two she knew, helped him up.Adelaide went to take a step forward but was quickly pulled back into a dark corner of the courtyard – one still untouched by the devastation around them. She pressed her wand into the neck of the person standing before her and it wasn't until she was pulled into a passionate kiss did her hand waiver. Still trembling from everything going on, Adelaide pulled away."Charlie!" she cried, tears streaming immediately down her cheeks as she jumped up and into his arms, holding herself against him tightly. "Oh, Charlie." She whispered against the crook of his neck. His strong arms held her up against his chest and while he looked a little worse for wear, he was in one piece. He was alive and he was right there with her."So much for staying hidden to help the injured." Charlie whispered with a soft chuckle, his hands resting on the backs of her thighs as they continued their embrace."I love you. I love you. I love you." She cried, cupping his face in her hands, and kissing him roughly. He tasted like blood, sweat, and tears but she found herself without a care in the world. She knew they would be separated again, and she needed him to know. Locked in the heated embrace, they were only dragged apart when the walls around them started to shake with more explosions nearby. She slipped from his grasp, stepping back to look up at him."Marry me." Charlie breathed out, his hands grabbing onto Adelaide's. "Marry me when this is over.""I don't need to tell you what my answer is. You already know." She whispered, kissing him fervently once more before prying herself away and rushing back into the castle. Charlie went to the opposite way, his wand poised high at eye level, jinxes and hexes flying every which way.Adelaide continued her way through the castle, deflecting what she could. She got nabbed in the arm with something and she wasn't sure what. It set her back a bit, causing her to stagger into the wall before she quickly healed the gash and continued running through the rubble.She lost count of how long she rushed around, helping younger students who got caught in the crossfire, but it wasn't until she neared two familiar redheads did her heart stop. Her breath caught in her throat as she stepped closer."Percy!" she cried, confused at the scene before her. She rushed forward with wide eyes as she realized the taller of the two was sprawled out on the ground and was not moving. Percy had tears streaming down his cheeks, a look of bewilderment on his face as his hands continued nudging at his brother's lifeless body."Percy." Adelaide called again, grabbing his attention with her hands on his shoulders. "What happened?" Tears forming in her eyes, blurring her vision as she fell to her knees next to Percy. She felt sick to her stomach and with shaking hands she reached forward to gently push hair from the forehead of her fallen brother.Fred."We... we were fighting Rookwood and.... And there was an explosion." Percy sobbed, his fists clenching tightly in his lap.Adelaide could sense he was unable to explain more right now. She turned her attention back to Fred and the next time she reached forward, she closed his eyes with a sob escaping her lips as she did so."We have to move him."◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇It had been more than a half hour since Adelaide got Fred's body into the great hall. More than a half hour since Voldemort called an armistice – threatening to kill everyone if Harry did not give himself up. She didn't think she could cry anymore but the moment Kinglsey walked in, carrying the body of Remus Lupin, she lost it. Sobs wracked her entire body and although she tried to keep it together for the sake of those around her that still needed to be healed, she couldn't. She helped Kingsley through her tears to get Remus' body on a cot."I'm so sorry, Remus." She whispered to him, her fingertips brushing against his cold face, tracing the largest scar across his cheek before she turned back to Kingsley. "What am I going to tell Tonks? This is going to destroy her."Adelaide was too busy crying and busying her hands with buttoning Remus' vest to notice the look of devastation on his face.And that was just it. There was nothing but devastation, all around them."Adelaide, I'm sorry." Kingsley reached down to place his hand on her shoulder. "Charlie is bringing her here now.""What? What do you mean?" Adelaide jumped up, dread filling her body. "She's here? She was supposed to be at home!" she cried, looking past Kingsley's body the moment she spotted Charlie walking in. He kept his eyes straight, focused on Adelaide as he carried the lifeless body of their best friend, Nymphadora Tonks, in his arms."No." Adelaide whispered, refusing to believe that this was happening. Charlie set Tonks down, her body laid out beside her husband. The second eldest Weasley brother immediately embraced Adelaide, kissing her forehead as he held her against him. He was doing what he could to remain strong, knowing that he needed to be resilient enough for them both, but it was becoming increasingly harder, especially when he heard a familiar voice cry out."Fred? No... No, not my Fred!"Adelaide whipped around, almost falling over herself to make it in time to hold Molly up in her arms. Percy held her up on the other side while Arthur stood behind them with his hand tightly laced with Ginny's. Adelaide felt horrible that she wasn't the one to tell them about Fred. She could see the anguish, clear as day, on Percy's face as he looked down to his brother, George, who knelt by Fred's body, crying. The tears were silent, but his shoulders were beginning to convulse as the sobs began to escape.Adelaide let go of Molly, gesturing for Charlie to take hold of his Mum, so she could kneel beside George, wrapping her arms around him from the side. "I'm so sorry, George." In a situation like this, Adelaide knew words could make no difference, or heal any wounds. She just needed him to know that she was there for him, for the entire Weasley family. Her family.Not much time had passed before the Golden Trio arrived. Adelaide stepped back to let Ron grieve with his family. Though the second she did, Charlie's hand found hers and he pulled her into a hug. He was doing what he could to stay strong but losing his brother and his best friend was starting to wear him down. Adelaide hugged him back tightly, rubbing his back as she pulled away from him.Harry was standing there behind them, his hands nervously tugging at his sweatshirt as he stared down at the bodies of Remus and Tonks."Go." Charlie whispered to her, cupping her chin gently only to kiss her firmly before he pulled back and rejoined his family around Fred.Adelaide stepped over to Harry, resting her head on his shoulder as she took his hand in hers. She knew words couldn't help the situation get better. She wanted Harry to know that he didn't lose everyone. She wanted him to know that she was there for him."You know, Remus wanted to make you-""Godfather. I know." Harry cut her off, sniffling a bit as he wiped at his eyes with his free hand."What? How do you know?" Adelaide lifted her head, glancing away from the couple laid out before them to focus on Harry now."He found us." Harry smiled as he thought back to when Remus found them in the woods. "And now I'm angry with myself because I was nasty to him." He admitted, giving Adelaide's hand a gentle squeeze. "He wanted to join us in our search. I refused to let him do that. Tonks just had the baby. I didn't want her to be mad at me for taking away her husband and the father of her son."Adelaide sucked in a deep breath, "I can't believe him." She groaned, though a laugh escaped her lips. It was typical of the Remus she knew and loved. "He loved you like a son, Harry. Just like Sirius did, I hope you know that. And they will never be far away." She let go of his hand to place her hand on his chest. "They will always be with you. Always. And I will be right here, too."Harry smiled gratefully and shrouded Adelaide in a hug. They stayed that way for another moment or two before parting ways.She knew they didn't have much time to sit down and talk things through. It would probably be a long time until things were back to normal for the wizarding world.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇Everything was happening so quickly that it was almost hard to process. Adelaide stood by the steps with her hand tightly laced in Charlie's as they watched the scene unfold before them. Voldemort and his army returned. And they weren't alone."Harry Potter.... is dead!"Ginny cried out and Arthur had to hold his daughter back from getting killed herself.Hagrid stood there, silently crying with a what appeared to be a dead Harry Potter in his arms.Adelaide gasped, her hand tightening around Charlie's as she looked up at him. Although it felt like she had just started crying again, the tears had truly never stopped. Not since the moment she saw Fred's dead body surrounded by the rubble that crushed him. They all stepped closer together and Charlie held onto his Mum's arm to keep her back.She stared down everyone who fought for the order the moment Voldemort called for them to turn coat and join him. Her hand clutched her wand tightly at her side and she knew if anyone so much as stepped one inch closer to that hideous creature of a man, she would kill them herself. She had enough pent-up rage, desperation, and sadness built up inside of her that she didn't want to think of losing this war. Not now. Not after everything they had all lost, what they had all been through to get to where they were now. She didn't want the sacrifices of those she lost to be in vain.Adelaide let her eyes fall on Draco Malfoy. She wasn't sure how he even got on their side. She could not remember seeing him but again the entire castle was in chaotic shambles."Draco." Lucius called from behind the Dark Lord, his hand outstretched for his son. "Come here, Draco. Come."As Draco glanced around slowly, he began taking a few steps ahead, but was stopped the moment Adelaide tore herself from Charlie's side and grabbed Draco's hand instead."Draco." She whispered, silently praying to Merlin that he remembered her and remembered that she was kind. She wanted to help him. She needed to help him. "Please. Stay." She begged him, turning a bit to look around her before letting her eyes land on Lucius and Narcissa. She could sense the same kind of fear in them but refused to let Draco join them. Voldemort needed to be kicked down a notch, or several.Draco visibly swallowed. His hands were shaking but he let Adelaide hold them and with one final look at his parents, he took a step back. He didn't speak and that was okay, he didn't have to. Adelaide knew he was staying. A sense of relief washed over the boy, and he gave Adelaide's hand a squeeze.The healer only stepped away once Luna stepped forward, silently telling Adelaide with her mannerisms that she would take her place. Luna held onto Draco's arm and smiled weakly up to the boy. "We're happy to have you here, Draco." She whispered up to him, before turning to face front again.Lucius and Narcissa looked absolutely appalled. Though, even from where she was standing, Adelaide could see that they were both terrified.Neville stepped forward and spoke loud and clear. Adelaide did not know him that well, but she felt proud of the boy as his speech continued."You're wrong." Neville stood tall, "Harry's heart did beat for us. For all of us!" he cried, unsheathing the sword of Godric Gryffindor.It was then that chaos ensued, again. Harry was not dead after all, and he leapt from Hagrid's arms. As soon as his feet were on solid ground, he raised a wand high in the air and shouted, "Confringo!" before rushing away from the courtyard.Adelaide clutched tightly onto Charlie, her eyes wide as clouds of black start shooting off from the ground, a telltale sign of the death eaters coming to attack. People were screaming out of fear, crying, and shouting with joy because Harry was alive. Adelaide felt the dread of having to bury another person she cared for dissipate.Everyone rushed back into the castle while Kingsley shielded them to the best of his ability. Charlie kept his hand secure around Adelaide's as they ran through the corridor and into the Great Hall. She wasn't sure when it happened, but they got separated. Her wand tight in her hand as she did what she could to keep herself protected.She didn't kill anyone, but she did manage to keep herself protected."Impedimenta!""Protego!"

"Flipendo!""Ginny!" The healer cried, rushing towards the redhead who had been knocked over. She quickly scooped her up and turned to see Molly stepping inbetween them and Bellatrix Lestrange. Adelaide's blood ran cold at the sight of the woman who murdered Sirius. A scowl formed on her lips as she held tight onto the younger girl."Not my daughters, you bitch!"Adelaide cringed when the spell was sent. Molly stood proud and tall though her hand trembled the slightest bit as she watched Bellatrix fade away into nothing. She then turned and scooped both Ginny and Adelaide in a crushing hug.◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇When it was over, there was something in the air. Adelaide couldn't explain what it was, but it was like the fog had lifted. She was completely exhausted, she had no idea what time it was, but the sun was beginning to rise over the rolling hills that normally kept the castle of Hogwarts safe.Her bones ached and her muscles were sore. Her throat was raw from screaming and crying. She watched Ginny rush off to find Harry, knowing what it felt like to be young and in love. After all, she was still young. And she was in love. Very... Very much in love."Charlie!" She cried, rushing forward the moment she saw him standing beside Ron and Hermione.She leapt from the ground and up into Charlie's outstretched arms."I'm never letting you out of my sight. Ever again." Charlie whispered to her, his hands grabbing onto her back to keep her pressed in close against his chest. Her arms had weaved their way around his neck and her face was against the side of his neck, her eyes squeezed shut as tears fought their way out."I love you so much, Charles Weasley." She told him, sniffling as she pulled away and looked at him. Her hands held either side of his neck before she pressed her lips against his passionately."That's our cue to go find Harry." Ron muttered, his cheeks tinged pink as he watched Charlie and Adelaide deepen their kiss. He held his hand out for Hermione to take, which she did so gladly, before leaving the Great Hall."Are you hurt?" She asked him softly, pulling back slightly to get a better look at him. She kept her legs tightly wrapped around his waist so she could stay up, hoisted in his arms."No. I'm alright." He shook his head and kissed her again.They finally parted from the starving embrace only to ensure that neither were injured in any way. And with one look around them, Adelaide and Charlie knew, that even amongst the chaos and destruction, they had beaten the odds that were so carefully stacked against them.Eventually they found themselves outside of the castle, lingering in the courtyard with eyes set forward to watch the sunrise. The different hues of orange, pink, and yellow mixed together seamlessly, and Adelaide reached over to take Charlie's hand in hers with a soft smile forming on her lips.Nothing else was in their way. The weight, the worry, and the sadness that she had carried with her began burning away like wildfire. And for the first time in years, Adelaide truly felt at peace.

J U L Y 1998

"I think we need to tell everyone." Adelaide rolled over in bed, her eyes falling shut as the bright sun rays filtered in through the curtains. She groaned as she felt blinded for a moment before she rolled right back over to look at Charlie as he sat up, pulling his trousers on as he stood. 

"Can't we just keep it between the two of us for just a little while longer?" The redhead sighed and turned to look at his wife. He smiled warmly down at her. She was an absolute vision. Radiant in her beauty as the sun created a halo around her head from the window behind her. 

"Charlie!" Adelaide giggled as she sat up, letting the sheet fall to her waist as she gestured downwards with only her eyes. "I don't know how much longer I can hide this." She puckered her lips in a playful manner as he leaned down to kiss her. "Plus, we've only been married for one month and I know your Mum can do basic mathematics." 

Before the war, Adelaide would have said they were rushing things. But the week after Fred's funeral, she had to bury Tonks and Remus and as she stood by the hillside of the burrow holding Teddy in her arms, she knew she didn't want to wait a minute more. She wanted to marry Charlie. She wanted, no needed, to start the rest of her life, and little did she know that when they were fighting for their lives, the seed was already planted and there was new life beginning to grow within her, so she was already well on that path. 

Charlie reached down, his fingertips brushing down between her bare breasts before landing on a small little bump. It was barely noticeable for anyone who didn't stare at it every day - especially for the past three months. 

"Yes, Mum doesn't let anything get past her. Unfortunately..." Charlie bit his bottom lip in thought before he moved to lean further down and place a kiss on her belly. He let his lips longer there before pulling back and finished getting dressed for the day. 

"Alright, fine. We'll tell them today." 

◇─◇──◇─────◇──◇─◇

"I'm pregnant." 

The room erupted into cheers. Hoots and hollers loudly ricocheted between the walls of the burrow as Adelaide and Charlie finally broke the news to his family. Charlie was beaming ear to ear as he began hugging his siblings and their partners, enjoying the happiness that they all deserved to feel after years of the unknown and heartache of a war. 

The only one missing was George, and Adelaide knew that she would go and tell him separately when they were finished here. He had taken the loss of his brother badly, as would any surviving twin she assumed, so she did not take any offense that he refused to attend special events so soon after the war. George always held a special place in her heart. 

"Wait," Molly piped up from the end of the table. She was thinking - and thinking hard. "How?" She pointed between the two with an accusatory finger. 

"Darling, I think we all know how a baby is made. Let's not think of that right now, shall we?" Arthur chuckled, quickly calming his wife down as he could see the gears turning in her head about when the child was conceived since Adelaide said that her due date was the end of January. 

"Oh alright." Molly sighed, a wide smile now forming on her lips as she got up to hug Adelaide and Charlie, kissing them each on the cheek to congratulate them. 

"My first grand baby." Molly sighed happily as she leaned into her husbands embrace.

J A N U A R Y 1999

After what felt like a full week of active labor, though it was really only sixteen hours, Adelaide gave birth to a beautiful, healthy baby girl with hair as fiery red as her fathers. 

"Adora." The blonde gently pressed her finger into the palm of her daughter's hand, smiling happily as her perfect tiny little fingers wrapped tightly around her. "Adora Molly Weasley." 

"It's perfect. Just like her." Charlie sighed with content, shifting beside his wife on the bed as he stared down in awe at the baby swaddled in her arms. Adelaide said she had a feeling, without genuinely knowing, that the baby was a girl. She knew that she was getting a chance to honor the women she cared for most, both the deceased and living. For Adora - her mum, Adele, and best friend, Nymphadora. Molly - for her Mum in law who truly had always been like a second mother to her. 

"Molly is going to flip when she hears her name." Adelaide smiled again, looking up to her husband before handing their daughter over to him. 

"Which reminds me... we should probably tell them she's here." Charlie chewed at the inside of his cheek before looking towards the door. "I don't think I'm prepared to have all seventy five Weasley's, honorary and blood, in here."

"Seventy five?" Adelaide laughed, "You're being dramatic now."

"A slight exaggeration, sure." Charlie smirked before his whole demeanor changed as he sat in the chair with Adora held snug in his arms. The truth was that he just wanted this time alone with his family. He wanted to soak it all in because this was the path he never thought he would follow. The things he would never be able to have - a family of his own, love, protection, and peace.

After the call was made by patronus, Charlie swore he could sense the moment his Mum arrived via floo in the atrium of St. Mungos. 

"She's here." He warned Adelaide, a chuckle escaping his lips before a soft cry coming from the little baby in his arms distracted him. 

"Oh, now don't let grandmummy see you cry. She'll never let you go. And me and your mum will never hear the end of it." Charlie whispered down to his daughter. They stared at one another and Adelaide felt her heart swell with pride. The happiness was almost overwhelming, but they both had gone through so much to get here and now that they were finally here, it almost did not feel real. 

Once the door opened, the entire Weasley clan made their way in. Gifts piled high in Ron's arms as he struggled to set everything down on the bedside table. 

"I take it you were the elected gift carrier." Adelaide smiled up at Ron as she leaned forward to gently kiss his cheek in a greeting. 

"That will be my job until the day I die, I'm afraid." Ron teased, letting his eyes fall on his Mum who had already whisked the baby away and out of her fathers arms. 

The noises coming from Molly Weasley were otherworldly. Arthur just stood behind her chair, beaming with pride as he looked down on the bundle of joy. 

"She's got Charlie's hair. No mistaking she's a Weasley, eh?" The new grandfather teased with a soft chuckle. He almost sounded nervous, as if he didn't know what to do with a baby. Which, obviously, was preposterous. He fathered seven children of his own but Adelaide knew it had been quite some time since he held a newborn. 

"Oh, she's a Weasley alright." Adelaide laughed softly, reaching over to slide her hand into Charlie's as they both sat back, relishing in the love encompassing their daughter from her aunt, uncles and grandparents. 

Though it was tough to know that Adora would grow up without Faustus and Adele as grandparents, Adelaide knew she was going to be well taken care of by the Weasleys. She would make sure that her daughter grew up with stories about her family, as well as Tonks and Remus and everyone else who did not make it to see Voldemort get defeated. 

That included her other great love - Sirius Orion Black III.

A U G U S T 2003

Summertime at the burrow was beginning to look like she always remembered. Laughter coming from the mouths of children. Picnic blankets and treats strewn about the bibs green blades of grass. Magic did the burrows yard wonders. The sound of their grandchildren playing with one another, well, it was music to the ears of Molly and Arthur Weasley. 

"Adora! Be gentle with little Victoire!" Adelaide called to her four year old daughter, who was currently brushing what looked like a fork throughout her baby cousins hair. 

There were two years of difference between the girls and already their friendship was a beautiful thing.

Adelaide let her hands run over her belly, groaning slightly at another hard kick the newest Weasley family member offered their mum from the inside. 

"A puppy!" Adora screamed excitedly, tossing the fork over her shoulder as she leapt up from the blanket she was sitting on with Victoire. 

She ran as fast as her little legs could take her, heading straight for her father who was standing by the house with a puppy in his arms. 

"Merlin, Charlie! What the bloody hell have you done now?" Bill called from the picnic table as he gestured to Adelaide who struggled to get herself up from her chair to waddle over to him. 

"I thought we said we would wait until this one was born!" Adelaide sighed, a soft smile starting to grow on her lips as she finally made it to Charlie's side, their daughter playing with the puppy already by their feet. 

Adelaide let her hand slip into Charlie's as Adora giggled uncontrollably. The puppy licked her face repeatedly, happy little whines leaving his mouth as Adora laid down to continue cuddling him. 

"I know. But this one... I don't know. There was something special about him." Charlie shrugged nonchalantly. 

"He is so pretty, daddy." Adora giggled some more, her little hands running through the thick black hair of her new pet. She was doing what just about any four-year-old would do, inspecting  everything she could get her hands on. She played with his ears, then checked out his tail. 

"So pretty." Adelaide repeated, a giggle of her own escaping her lips as she leaned up and kissed Charlie softly. "Are you trying to clinch the title of best parent?" She teased against his lips. 

Charlie wrapped his arms around her waist, hands slipping along her lower back as he held her close. The feeling of her pregnant belly pressing against him made him smile, his lips finding hers once more in a passionate, though still child-friendly, kiss. 

"His feet, mummy! Look!" Adora struggled to pick up the puppy, stumbling backwards a bit before Charlie knelt beside her to hold the puppy. 

"What about his feet, baby?" Adelaide smiled and ran her fingers through the fiery red strands of her daughters messy curls. 

Adora held the puppy's foot and smiled up to her mum. "Look! His feet! Big!" 

"Yes, baby, he has big feet! That means he's going to be a big dog when he grows up."

The warmth spread throughout her at witnessing the wonder and happiness behind her daughters eyes. She was so elated that she almost missed the next thing Adora said. 

"His feet have little pads on the bottom. Mummy, look at them!" Adora ran her fingers along the pads of the puppy's foot before she kissed both of her parents. 

"Padfoot."

"What was that, darling?" Adelaide leaned down a bit more, playfully scratching the puppy's chin. 

"Padfoot." Adora repeated herself firmly. "I'm going to name him Padfoot."

With that, Charlie let the puppy climb out of his hands before standing up to watch Adora run off with the puppy chasing her heels. 

Adelaide had not moved a muscle. Not even so much as a blink as she stood there, staring off after her daughter. That was a name she had never so much as uttered in the presence of Adora. How could she have known? Adelaide then realized the innocent four-year-old was just that. Innocent. She didn't know what that name meant to her mum. She didn't know what that name meant at all. 

"Are you alright, love?" Charlie stepped up behind his wife, both hands slipping down her belly lovingly as he let his chin rest on her shoulder. 

"I'm alright." She whispered, wiping a tear from her cheek quickly.

She hated admitting it but it had been a while since she truly thought of Sirius. She missed him so much, but knew that he would always be with her. Her hand reached up to gently touch the ring that still hung around her neck. Charlie never fought with her on it. He knew how much it meant to her. He would do just about anything to make his wife happy. 

"I love you." She turned in his arms, leaning up to kiss him once more. 

Though the tears were brought on by sad memories, she truly was happy. She had everything she had ever wanted in life. The sound of the children playing behind her, the laughter and happiness of her loved ones, and the lack of lingering fear about death and war being an added bonus.

"I love you, too."

One tiny spark, created so long ago between two young friends, spread fast and wide into real adoration. Yes, the real thing. Love. 

Just like Wildfire.
