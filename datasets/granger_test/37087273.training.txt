"Where is your son, Lucius?"The question made the middle-aged Death Eater shiver.Where was Draco Malfoy anyway? He himself, didn't have the answer to that. Deep in his guts, he felt disgusted for his son's cowardice to be present at today's meeting.No matter where he was, there was no way out of his destiny; to become one of them.The youngest amongst them all.The blond man gulped hard before answering. "It was not the right time for him to be out of school today. Believe me, my Lord, he wants this more than everything, but--""Silence!" he yelled, slamming his disgusting hand on the black, hardwood table, full of Death Eaters.Feeling satisfied with the terror being plastered on the senior Malfoy's face, the Dark Lord smiled sardonically. "Make sure he is atteneds the next meeting. Or the whole Malfoy family will pay the price."Looking down at his trembling hands, and with the fear still visible on his expression, Lucius Malfoy nodded. "Your wish is my command, my Lord.""Very well," the Dark Lord said, as he touched Lucius's shoulder, while making his way around the table. "I absolutely need a Hogwarts student on our team. A boy or a girl that I can trust. At least one of you must offer their son or daughter, and since our dear Lucius here made the offer first, I shall give him one last chance. One last chance to show his devotion to me," he evilly smiled, while pointing at himself with his yellow nail.The dark words coming out of his thin lips, sounded exactly like the hissing of a snake. They were chilling, cold, repulsive.Even though he was in deep terror, the senior Malfoy felt incredibly satisfied and thrilled with the idea of his son being one of the youngest Death Eaters ever. Who else could it be anyway? Crabbe's son? Or maybe Goyle's?Not that he ever thought of his son as something special, the exact opossite. He strongly believed that his son was as incapable as the other two.But Draco was different, he was a Malfoy; he would never be the same as them. He was already superior, just by being a Malfoy.To offer his son to the Dark Lord, was the ultimate proof of devotion. Draco must attend the next meeting. They had no other option. He had to be there.But what twisted mission would the Dark Lord ask of him to accomplish? The boy was just seventeen years of age.Lucius was trying to avoid the thoughts that flooded his mind, but he couldn't get away from the truth.His son had to kill a man, in order to become a trusted Death Eater. That was one of the first, and most crucial steps. You must kill, and you must make them beg for their death.Lucius remembers the soul he took away, sixteen years ago. Hell, he remembers the day, as if it was yesterday. Draco was just one year old, when his father was commissioned with the disreputable task.His blue eyes landed at the surprisingly silent, Severus Snape; he looked pensive and concerned.Surely the reason for his concern was the fact that Draco was his student, and a Slytherin as well. The young Malfoy was, in a way, under his protection. He was responsible for him.Draco himself was not the reason though. Snape was more worried about... Snape. With Lucius's son becoming a Death Eater, he would also have to fill his already full life, with more concerns about the young boy.Snape would personally have to make sure that the once little Draco Malfoy, had the proper education to fulfill his calling. He had to be one hundred percent ready for his greatest moment.But with his son not being here today, Lucius was convinced that Snape wasn't doing his job right. Draco had to be here, eager for this moment, not hiding like a sewer rat."I've let the incapable Severus Snape to prepare my even more incapable son for his mission... what did I expect, really?" he wondered.Snape's dark eyes snapped on Lucius, like he read his mind. "Patience, Malfoy," he mouthed through gritted teeth and with an expressionless face.Lucius shook his head and took a look at Narcissa - his wife - who held his hand tightly through the whole meeting. Her brown and blonde locks fell perfectly on her shoulders. "Where is our son, Lucius? Why does he put us on the spot like that?" she whispered.He held her hand tightly as well. "Soon, my darling. Soon enough, he will take responsibility. I will personally make sure of it." Hello everyone! This is just the introduction of our story, that's why it's so small. You can check the next chapter, right now!Thank you very much guys xxComments are deeply appreciated!

Draco Malfoy was furious that he still wasn't allowed to attend today's Death Eaters meeting.Thanks to Snape."You are definitely not ready to be there with us. You still are a stupid, naive boy; You need to be a man, Draco. Stop playing around with Potter and his minions, and focus on your mission. Get serious. Try the spell again. And don't leave this room if you don't master it. Understood?"The Slytherin boy looked at him with clenched jaw, his nostrils flaring.Classic Malfoy attitude."Understood?" Snape asked again, with a more firm tone on his voice."Yes," Draco spat through gritted teeth.The thing he hated the most, was being bossed around, but he was stuck with Snape.The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was the one to decide when Draco would be ready to meet the Dark Lord, and be assigned a task to officially join the Death Eaters."Good," he answered, ignoring his attitude. "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go. If you master the spell, you can join me the next time."Those where his last words before he left him alone in the Room of Requirement.Draco rolled his eyes, but kept his strong grip on his Hawthorn wood wand. He had to get serious.What he desperately wanted, was to be at the next gathering. The strong desire to show everyone, especially his father, that he was meant to be somebody, was all that he could think about.To prove that he wasn't just the Slytherin prince. That he could be the Slytherin King."Sectumsempra," he said out loud, but nothing happened to the lazy frog that he stole from Potions class."Fuck this," he hissed, gliding his ring coated fingers with frustration through his hair.He decided it was time for a break. He couldn't lose another class anyway, even though he believed that the Hogwarts school had nothing else to offer him.Soon, he would be serving the Dark Lord. And that would make him become one of the greatest wizards of all times.After putting his Slytherin cloak on, he left the Room of Requirement.Making sure nobody was watching him, he walked through the empty halls, to get to the Slytherin Dungeon. It had to be done with caution, so that no one would find out that he left his room this morning.Finally getting there, he whispered the password, and got inside the Slytherin Common Room.He stormed into his dormitory, and started changing his clothes.He wore a white button up shirt, his green tie, and a grey Slytherin blazer on top of them. Black dress pants, some cologne and he was ready to go.Putting his cloak back on, he got his wand, his "Potions" book, and a packet of mint chewing gum as well. After popping one in his mouth, he left his room again.Casually walking to class, he saw that everybody was waiting for him; Blaise, Theodore, Andrew and Felicity."Oi guys, look it's Malfoy in the flesh. He's alive after all," Blaise mocked and everyone laughed.Draco rolled his eyes. "Shut it, Zabini. I had more important things to do,"  he spat."Whoa, someone woke up on the wrong side of his bed this morning," Theodore commented."If he even slept in his bed! He wasn't there when I woke up. Where were you, really?" Andrew asked."Fuck, he noticed that I was missing," he thought, but managed to keep his cool."Uhm yes, I didn't sleep there last night," he lied, scratching the back of his head."Oh god, don't you get tired of sleeping around with those random girls from Ravenclaw?" Felicity asked in annoyance.Malfoy smirked. "Don't get mad because you don't get any, Nott." The boys laughed at his comment, making Theodore's twin sister girl huff. "I'm just tired of hearing the girls in the hallways whispering about your... you know.""Dick?" Theodore snorted, emitting laughs from the rest of the group.She made a gagging sound. "I tried avoiding saying the exact word, but yes, about that."" It's not my problem if they can't get over me. They have never been fucked so good before, so I can't blame them,"  he shrugged with a cocky smile plastered on his lips." Okay, that's enough talking about Malfoy's sex skills,"  Theodore commented, not being able to control his laughter. " Let's get to class, before Slughorn does." They all followed him inside the classroom, taking their usual seats. Draco had no interest of the lessons that were offered anymore, but he had no choice. He had to act like everything was normal. Not to give anyone any doubt about him being the same old, careless Malfoy.Stretching his body on his chair, he entwined his hands behind his blond head. He lazily gazed outside of the classroom's big window.Draco couldn't help, but feel terribly bored. He really hated it here.Then, Slughorn appeared. The old teacher was immediately caught up in a conversation with that loser Harry Potter, the mudblood Granger and the stupid Weasley.Malfoy never understood what was the big deal about Harry Potter. He always thought of him as a sore loser, nothing more. And that story about him defeating Voldemort? Pure bullshit.It was a mental story, to begin with. Draco was absolutely sure that this whole thing was made up by Albus Dumbledore himself. He always favored Harry Potter, since the moment he stepped his foot into Hogwarts.Proffesor Slughorn started the lesson, instructing everyone to get to page 46 of their books.Harry and Ron admitted that they had no books of this year's Potions class, so Slughorn told them to go to the closest cabinet, and take one book each.Ron and Harry fought over a certain book, but Ron seemed to get the one they both wanted. It was a brand new Potions book, but Potter's was old and almost ripped apart.Even seeing the disappointment on Harry's face, made Draco feel better.Slughorn told them to get up from their seats, and start preparing the ingredients they needed for today's potion."This potion must be older than Slughorn himself,"  Draco commented ironically, and Blaise couldn't help but burst into laughter. They both tried to hide their laughter, by lowering their heads down.Thankfully, the class finished sooner than Draco expected, because honestly, he had better things to do.The whole companionship went to the Great Hall for their lunch. Draco quickly finished his food, and went straight back to the Room of Requirement, to master his spell.He had to perfect it. He had to be at the next meeting.The time had come._" My Lord,"  Snape started talking, but he felt his blood turn cold, when Voldemort's deadly eyes landed on him. " I do not believe that the young Malfoy is capable enough to accomplish what you may ask him to do. He is not... as worthy as his father makes him sound..." The souless eyes stayed glued on him. " What are you implying, Severus? That I am that stupid, to not be able to tell if a wizard is worthy of serving me or not?"  he seethed.Snape slowly gulped, but showed no emotions. The once full room, was now empty. He hoped that Voldemort wouldn't hear the sound of his heart, beating rapidly in his chest." Of course not, my Lord. Of course I would never believe such thing. My belief is, that he might need the help of another person... A person that will make sure he follows your exact orders..." The Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, would never believe that he would have to do, what he was about to do.Of course he knew that this day would come... but he would never be fully prepared for it.This was the only way to keep her safe; safe from Voldemort, safe from the Death Eaters, safe from the chaos that it was about erupt.Everything he had teached her, led up to this. To this moment.Knowing that the young witch was one of the best of her generation, he was absolutely sure that she would change the world one day." And who that might be, my dear friend?"  Voldemort asked, with a devilish smile on his almost non - existent lips. " Don't keep me in the dark; I am very eager to hear about that young fellow of yours." Of course he would never reveal to him who that girl really was; this would mean the end of her life, as well as his.But he didn't care about his well-being , at all. His only care, was her. Only her." It is my... my niece... Athena," he finally managed to form the words.There was no turning back now, and he knew it. This was the begining of everything he ever feared, for the last decade.Voldemort's evil expression turned into a surprised one. " Your niece? As far as I know, you have no brother or sister, my dear Severus." " Yes, indeed, I have no sister or brother. But this girl, is the daughter of my distant cousin, Cornelius Van de Kamp, and his wife's, Ella's. They have been dead for years, my Lord. They sacrificed themselves for you at the First Wizarding War."  That was part of the actual truth. " They were very loyal to you,"  he added." Ah, yes, my dear, dear Cornelius and Ella. But I never knew they had a child together. Why did you hide this from me, may I ask? You are supposed to have no secrets from me, Severus. But as you already know, I am very generous. So I will give you the chance to explain yourself, before I make you regret the day you decided to lie to me..."  he warned. He was outraged.The blood on Snape's veins remained frozen. But this was the only way to keep her as secured as possible, so he went on with his and Dumbledore's plan." Forgive me, my Lord. I had no intentions of misleading you. All I wanted, was to have her be one hundred percent ready and trusted, to obey you. A naive, young girl wouldn't be worthy of serving you." When he saw that Voldemort had his undivided attention, he continued. "Please, show us mercy. Let me bring her to the next Death Eaters meeting, so you can see with your own eyes, that she is worthy of your time. I promise you, we will not let you down again." The Dark Lord shook his head. " But of course, my dear friend. But I will say this for once, and once only..."  In a split second, he was in front of Severus, pushing his wand under his chin. " I am warning you. This must be the last secret you will ever keep from me. If this ever happens again, it will be the last thing you will ever do. You and your niece will become an excellent meal for my dear Nagini here..."  he said, petting the enormous female snake. " Understood?"  he asked, pressing his wand even further." Yes, my Lord,"  Severus answered." Very well, my friend,"  Voldemort finally took his wand away. " You may go now..."  he motioned with his hand.He didn't have to say it twice. Snape apparated, but he didn't return to Hogwarts; he went to his old parent's house, in Cokeworth.It was time. He had to prepare Athena for her next big step.Today was the day.Snape had no intentions of coming back to his parents' house. But he had no other choice when he had to take care of Athena, when she was just a toddler.The only people aware of Athena's existence, were Albus Dumbledore of course, and Minerva McGonagall as well. These two were the only people Snape trusted with his life. Their help throughout the years of raising Athena, were very valuable.Nothing saddened him more, than when Athena had to stay at the old house, all by herself. Sometimes, it would take him days, or even weeks to find a little time to get back here.Unfortunately, there was no other choice. This was the best way to keep her a secret from Voldemort and his vicious followers.But now, he felt like he was about to throw his little girl to the wolves. For the time being, with Voldemort knowing about her existence now, was the way to keep her safe and sound.Revealing to him his long kept secret, was something no one could escape from.  Voldemort would find out sooner or later. So it was in everyone's favor, that Snape was the one to spill the secret.Everytime he had to return to his home, he was always making sure that no other Death Eater was following him. Athena was teached from a young age to protect or hide herself if ever needed, but he couldn't bare the thought of her fighting those killers all alone.They wouldn't go easy on her because she was a child. They never really cared about those " little details"  anyway.Snape had teached her everthing she knew; Magic Spells, Potions, History of Magic, Defense Against the Dark Arts. He would have her practice everything, for hours, every single day.All that, because he wanted to make sure that Athena was absolutely ready for everything that might come her way.Athena would be usually found in the library, studying or practicing a new spell. She was a very talented young witch, indeed. Magic was her passion.The most vivid memory he had of her, was Athena pleading him to enroll her to Hogwarts. But he couldn't risk it then. It was way too soon.Inhaling a breath of fresh air, he stepped inside the old house. He searched everywhere for her, but Athena was nowhere to be found.He decided to check the garden, and there she was, picking up snails for the potion he asked her to make as homework.The grass was wet from the rain, and the smell of petrichor* was filling the air around them.Smiling lightly at the sight of her, he called out her name softly.Hearing someone calling for her, Athena turned her head around. The moment she saw that it was Severus, she smiled widely and rushed in to his arms. " Severus, you're back, finally!"  she exclaimed.Snape tightened his arms around her petite silhouette, and kissed her black hair lightly. He pushed her away gently, and looked into her green eyes." Yes darling, I'm back. But this time, we are leaving together. Tomorrow, you are coming to Hogwarts with me,"  he informed her, feeling his heart getting heavy with every word he spoke.Her face immediately lit up. " Are you serious? Oh Merlin, I'm so excited!"  she almost squealed, clapping her two hands together.Snape felt his throat tighten and getting dry with her response. He had a tiny hope that she wouldn't be interested of going to Hogwarts anymore.He coughed lightly before speaking. " Yes, dear. The time has come. You have to get ready for your mission. It's time for you to join me and the Dark Lord. To fulfill your purpose, and make me proud..." Of course he didn't mean the last sentence he uttered. But now, there was no turning back.He felt his heart getting stone cold.But Athena? Boy, was she happy! She has been waiting for this moment since forever. It was time to show her worth." Really?!"  she asked still smiling, her eyes glowing with excitement.Even though this was hurting him deeply, he knew he shouldn't show any negative emotions.This was her whole life, she was preparing for this non-stop. On the other hand, this was his worst nightmare coming true.All these years, he had to make sure that Athena was devoted to the idea of being a Death Eater. There had to be no doubt that that's what she truly wanted, so she could convince everyone that she was honest.Death Eaters could smell the fear from miles away." Yes Athena, I am absolutely serious. We are leaving for Hogwarts early in the morning. I want you to pack everything you need, Albus Dumbledore is expecting us as soon as possible." He didn't have to say it twice. Athena smiled at him, and stormed inside the house and to her room, so she would get ready for the big day.When she left, Snape let out a big sigh. He hadn't realised that he was holding his breath this whole time.But that was him, having no other option. This  was his, and Dumbludore's plan all along. To get Athena to Hogwarts when she would be fully prepared for everything.His mind went back to the day he showed the 1-year-old girl to the old headmaster of Hogwarts. She was so small, with black hair and bright, green eyes.But she was also very fragile and thin. The orphanage that she was staying at, wasn't treating the children in the best way possible. Especially little Athena.The staff of the orphanage where very afraid of her, due to her magical powers. But of course, they had no idea that they actually were magical powers.They thought she was the devil.When he heard the stories about what she could do, he remembered the memory that Dumbledore showed him to the Pensieve of Hogwarts.The memory was from the day he went to take the young Tom Riddle, from the very same orphanage. The story had so many similarities, that it really scared Snape. And Snape was rarely scared.But he couldn't leave her there, when he found out about her existence. When he confessed it to Dumbledore, the old wizard instructed him to immediately go there and take her away.She was so young, so they couldn't risk the possibility that Muggles found out about their secret world.Snape didn't care about that though. His only concern,  was to protect Athena from Voldemort and every other possible danger.So, he went there and took her away. The headmistress of the orphanage was more than happy to get rid of the little trouble.That was the plan they both agreed on, when he first showed him the little green eyed girl." Remember this, Severus. She and Harry Potter, are the only hope we have,"  he said in a very serious tone, that no one could deny his words.The old headmaster pulled something gold out of his cloak's pocket, and put it in Snape's palm." This is my gift to her. Make sure you keep it safe, at all costs. It belongs to Athena." Snape looked at the item, that he felt like it was burning in his palm.It was Salazar Slytherin's Locket." B-but how did you get a hold of this?"  he asked, breathless."No need for questions, my friend. Give it to her when she becomes 10 years of age. To her, and her only. Alright?" Snape didn't ask any further questions that night. He decided to put the locket in a small, wooden box and lock it with powerful spells.He had to ensure that Athena wouldn't find out about this locket, before her tenth birthday comes.Feeling his hands getting cold, he got inside the house and locked himself in his office.He wrote a letter to Dumbledore, informing him for his and Athena's arrival tommorow at Hogwarts.The owl gladly took the letter in it's beak, and flew out of the window, disappearing in to the dark sky.After locking his window, he sat at the sofa, near the lit fireplace, lost in his thoughts.*Petrichor; /ˈpɛtrʌɪkɔː/noun: pleasant smell that frequently accompanies the first rain after a long period of warm, dry weather.Here is the second chapter, my darlings! I hope you enjoyed reading it!Soon everything will go wild!Can't wait for your comments xxMuch love to all 💚

The next morning arrived, and everything was ready.After Snape and Athena had their breakfast and a cup of lemon tea, they were ready to go.Their first stop would be Diagon Alley. Athena had to get everything she needed for her classes at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.She was very excited while they were doing their shopping. She only got the best of the best, as Snape wanted.Severus Snape was trying to be as discreet as possible. He shouldn't be seen with Athena. So, he was wearing a cloak with a big hood, hiding his face and his long, black hair.After about two hours of shopping, Athena had everything she wanted.They really had to head to Hogwarts now. Dumbledore was expecting them.The first day he ever saw Athena, was also the last. The old headmaster was really curious to see her, after all these years.They went to a little corner with few people, and Snape apparated them both to Hogwarts. They were immediately transported to the front of the Headmaster's office door.Snape knocked twice, and when he heard Dumbledore calling them inside, he opened the grand office door.They left the numerous packages on the ground, and got closer to the old wizard.Albus Dumbledore had long, silver hair, and an even longer beard. And right now, he was smiling kindly at them." Severus, finally! Finally, I get to meet Athena. I have heard so much about you, dear." Athena smiled shyly. " Nice to meet you too, sir. I am really excited to be at Hogwarts. I can't wait to start my classes here,"  she smiled wider.He nodded his head, agreeing with her words. " I am glad that you are here as well. Now, the only thing I want from you, is to keep other people from knowing about your relation to Severus. You must keep it a secret, at all costs,"  he warned her." Of course sir, there is no need to worry. We have discussed everything with Severus,"  Athena reassured him." That's great. So, you will tell them that you transferred from Beauxbatons school, am I correct?" Snape nodded. " We believe that this is the most convincing story to tell; They won't suspect a thing. Her last name is of dutch origin, and the school accepts students from the Netherlands." " Good, good. That is an excellent idea!"  Dumbledore smiled again. " So, I think that miss Granger will be here any time soon, to guide you through Gryffindor, and the rest of the school of course,"  he said, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.Snape and Athena froze. " Gryffindor?"  Snape asked, shocked. " But I thought we agreed that she will be placed at Slytherin, so I can be close to her, Albus!" " With all due to respect sir, I was preparing for my whole life for Slytherin. I mean, that's what Severus taught me all these years..."Athena spoke, feeling her heart racing; She really didn't want to be a Gryffindor." I am aware of that, dear Athena. But I honestly believe you will be a better fit for Gryffindor. Listen to me, I know what I am doing. It's for your own good." Athena felt her blood boiling. She didn't need protection from anyone. She was capable of taking care of herself, she didn't need Dumbledore, or anyone else to do it for her.Snape opened his mouth to protest, but Athena touched his shoulder, letting him know it was alright. " Don't worry, Severus. Everything will be fine. Go, we'll meet later,"  she gave him a reassuring smile.He hesitated before nodding, still unsure about the way things turned out. He gave Dumbledore a furious last look, and stormed out of the office.Athena turned to the Hogwarts headmaster. " I hope you know what you're doing, professor,"  she said without hesitation.He smiled. " You are definetely a Slytherin, my child. There is no doubt about that. But I can't protect you, if you become a Slytherin,"  he calmly admitted.She stared at him, confused. " What's that supposed to mean?" He didn't say another word, as he heard a soft knock on the door. " Please, come in miss Granger,"  he said, as he sat on the chair behind his desk.The door opened, and a brown - haired girl appeared. She seemed a little bit taken aback when she saw Athena there. " Did you ask for me, professor?"  she asked, with a perfect, very clean British accent." Ah, yes dear. Here is miss Athena Van de Kamp. She just transferred here from Beauxbatons, and she was sorted in Gryffindor. I want you to show her around our school. She will also be your new roomate,"  he explained, with a soft smile on his face." Certainly, sir,"  Hermione nodded and looked at Athena, straightening her posture. " Nice to meet you, Athena, I'm Hermione "  she extended her hand, smiling politely at her.Athena shook her cool hand, and smiled back. " Nice to meet you too, Hermione." Dumbledore smiled, observing them. " Good, now that you introduced yourselves to each other, you are ready to go. Your first class starts soon, you shouldn't miss it,"  he said, as he walked up to them.He touched Athena's shoulder, looking straight into her green eyes. " Please, take care of yourself, Athena. I am here for you if you ever need anything,"  he said, with a very serious expression on his face.She nodded. " Of course. Thank you, sir,"  she replied and left his office, following Hermione.Why was everyone telling her to be careful? She didn't like this warning. At all." So, Beauxbatons, right? Then you are definitely from the Netherlands. I mean, your last name is dutch, and Beauxbatons has students from there. And also from Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and France of course..." Hermione trailed off, feeling a little embarrassed. "I mean, as far as I remember..." Athena was a little shocked that Hermione knew all these details about Beauxbatons and the origin of her last name.She couldn't help but worry that Hermione will easily uncover her secrets one day. She was way too smart to fool. After all, she was the wisest and smartest witch of this school.But Athena wouldn't let Severus's plans to go to waste. If she had to lie to everyone about her life, she would do it in a heartbeat." Yes, that's very true. It was chaotic to be there, to say the least. I truly believe that Hogwarts is the right place for me,"  she smiled." No doubt about that. Hogwarts is truly unique. I promise you, you'll love it here,"  she reasurred her.The smile was still on Athena's face. She really liked Hermione." I hope so,"  she shrugged." But how have your parents decided to send you so far away from home? Aren't they worried?" Athena gulped. Well, here goes another lie. " Uhm, my parents sent me here to keep me safe from You - Know - Who. He is after them... Because of that, I had to leave my school as soon as possible..." she explained. "But I know that Harry Potter is his main target now... So I don't know for how long I'll be safe here..." Hermione stopped in her tracks, and looked at her, feeling bad. " Oh Athena, I'm so sorry! I had no idea..."  she whispered.Athena smiled sadly. " Don't worry, I am used to it. I'll be fine,"  she said.Hermione gave her a comforting smile. " It will be alright, you'll see. Now let's go to the Gryffindor tower. I have to show you our Common Room, and our dormitories. You'll love it there,"  Hermione grabbed her hand, and they both run to the Tower.When they arrived there, they were out of breath, laughing uncontrollably.They got closer to the Fat Lady portrait, and Hermione whispered the password. The door opened, revealing the cozy Gryffindor Common Room.The place was full of red and gold colors. Comfortable armchairs were all over the room, where many student's were reading the Daily Prophet, or they were just chilling before the classes start.The big fireplace at the corner had a beautiful, orange flame burning, making Athena feel instantly at home. The paintings on the walls, gave the Gryffindor Common Room a more classic sparkle." Wow, it's so beautiful in here,"  she said mesmerized. The place was really astonishing." Glad you like it,"  Hermione smiled. " Now, let me introduce you to everyone here. It's good to know as many people as possible." Hermione introduced Athena to everyone in the room. They seemed really interested to the newly transferred student, and they instantly liked her.Athena was always a pleasant person to be around. She projected a warmth to the people surrounding her." Now that we are over with this, let's get your things to our room. Hope you'll like it there as well." They carried Athena's stuff up the stairs and to the girls' dormitories. When they got there, Hermione helped her put everything away, and showed her her bed.After everything was set, they got ready for their Potions class.Hermione lent Athena one of her Gryffindor cloaks, because she had Slytherin ones, but of course, Hermione musn't know about that.Athena would have to return her Slytherin uniform, and get a Gryffindor one, as soon as possible.She put her wand in her pocket, took her book and followed Hermione. On their way to the class, she was showing her around the school, and informed her about everything else she needed to know.When they arrived, professor Slughorn was nowhere to be seen.Hermione saw the boys sitting together and chatting, so she motioned Athena with her head to follow her.Harry and Ron saw their friend approaching, but their jaws dropped when they laid their eyes on Athena." Wow,"  she heard Ron whisper, his jaw to the ground.Athena laughed, hiding her face in her hair. Hermione couldn't help but roll her eyes at the boys." Well, hello there boys. This is Athena Van de Kamp, she is a new student here. She is also my friend and roomate, so be nice to her,"  she warned them.They both nodded in unison and stood up from the seats." I am Harry," , " I am Ron,"  they both said in unison again, and extended their hands to her.Athena couldn't help but laugh with their reaction. She shook Harry's hand first, and then Ron's. " Hi guys, I'm Athena, pleased to meet you,"  she shot them a grin." Okay idiots, someone offer her a seat. Be gentlemans for once,"  Hermione strictly ordered them." Sure!"  Harry said and almost pushed Ron off the chair he was sitting.Ron tried to protest, but Hermione dragged him to the nearest desk with her."Here, take a seat,"  Harry stood up and got the chair out for Athena to sit." Oh, thank you, you are so kind,"  she smiled at him, as they sat down at the same time.Harry smiled nervously. " So, where are you from, Athena?"  he asked, full of curiosity." I'm from the Netherlands, actually. I used to go to Beauxbatons,"  she replied, smiling at him." Oh, that's nice,"  he smiled as well.They chatted for a little bit, but then, he suddenly stopped talking. He was staring at the entrance of the classroom, his jaw clenched.Athena turned her head to the direction Harry was looking at, and saw a bunch of Slytherin students entering the classroom. First in line, was a blond, tall boy. A really handsome one." Who are they?"  she asked, not being able to take her eyes off of him." Those are some people you need to stay away from,"  he said through gritted teeth, still not looking at her." Why?"  she asked." Especially away from Malfoy,"  he continued, ignoring her question.Oh, so that was the notorious Draco Malfoy.Athena finally managed to put the pieces together. Draco looked just like his father, Lucius Malfoy.She only saw Lucius once in her life before, when he visited Severus at their home. Of course, he was oblivious to her existance.But she saw him that day, exactly two years ago. They were talking about Draco, but she couldn't really hear everything they discussed. Snape had casted the Muffliato Charm, before they entered his office.Like a magnet, Draco's head turned to Athena's direction. For some reason, she couldn't look away, even when their eyes met. God, were they beautiful...He was beautiful.Draco smirked when he saw her looking at him. But soon, the smirk turned into hatred, when he realized she was sitting next to Harry Potter.He immediately looked away, and sat on his chair, next to a curly, handsome boy.Athena came back to her senses after that. She felt like she was under a spell and just woke up from it. Or like her head was under the ocean for too long, and she just took a much needed breath of air." I will keep my distance, for sure,"  she mumbled, more to herself, than Harry." Good,"  he finally said, opening his book with caution. It was old, almost ripped apart and with writings all over the pages." Wow, you must really love Potions,"  she commented, nodding at the book, eager to change the subject." Uhm, yeah. I try to keep all my notes on the book, so it will be easier for me to study later,"  he quickly said.Athena felt like he was lying, but she didn't push the conversation any further. It wasn't her place anyway.She also opened her book, looking at it with no interest at all. She already knew everything that was written in here. Snape had taught her everything she needed to know anyway.But she couldn't help but take one last look at Draco Malfoy.He was sitting at his chair, his long legs stretched in front of him, and his hands entwined behind his blond head.He was talking with the boy that was next to him. He didn't turn his head to her, not once.At this very time, professor Slughorn entered the classroom, almost out of breath. " I'm sorry for being late my dear students, something unexpected came up,"  he apologized and left his things on his desk. He got a piece of paper in his hand, and took a look at it." As I see here, we have a new student. Athena Van de Kamp, am I right?"  he asked, his eyes searching for her in the classroom.She nervously stood up from her seat, fixing her cloak. " Yes sir, that's me. Nice to meet you everyone,"  she smiled." Good, good, welcome my dear,"  Slughorn smiled warmly. She smiled back at him, and sat down again.Draco was now looking at her, his whole face radiating negativity. What was his problem anyways?" Little brat,"  she thought, not sparing him another look.His friends were giving her the same look as well. Okay, now she was irritated. They didn't even know her, and they were already shooting dirty looks her way.She decided not to give them any more undeserved attention, so she opened her book to page 36, as Slughorn asked them to do.But the Potions' teacher had other plans for them." Now I want everyone to listen to me. For today's potion, you must pair up with another student," he started, "But the pairs will have a twist! You will not be partners with a student from the same House as yours; Gryffindors will have to work with Slytherins, and Hufflepuffs will co-operate with the Ravenclaws,"  he said smiling.Everyone in the classroom gasped. " No way!"  someone from Gryffindor said. All of the students agreed with him, and a chatter started around the classroom." Now now, everyone calm down! I am only doing this, because I don't want you to be hostile against each other. We're all in this together. Now, everyone choose someone and start the potion immediately,"  he ordered." I'm sorry for this, Athena,"  Harry said." It's fine, no worries. I guess I'll just have to put up with the Slytherins for the next hour,"  she lightly smiled." Who is going to offer their help to our new student? She knows no one, so you must put yourself out there, to make it easier for her. Be nice!"  Slughorn added.Athena's cheeks turned red when all of the Slytherin students looked at her.She felt her heart racing. They really had no intentions of being friendly towards her.Before anyone uttered a word, Malfoy got up from his seat. " I will pair up with her, sir,"  he smiled evilly at her.Athena rolled her eyes, before taking her things and getting ready to go over to him.But Harry stepped in front of her, stopping her. " In your dreams, Malfoy. It's only her first day here, you won't ruin it for her." Malfoy rolled his tongue inside his cheek, and smirked at them. " Easy there, Potter,"  he spat Harry's last name. " No one is taking your girlfriend away from you,"  he sarcastically said, making his group of friends burst into laughter.Athena placed her hand on Harry's arm. " It's okay Harry, I got this,"  she smiled.He looked at her, uncertain. " Are you sure?" " Yes,"  she steadily replied. She just wanted to get this over with.Harry nodded, and she went over to Malfoy's desk.He had a smile of victory on his face. He really enjoyed making Harry Potter furious." Well, you made the right move I guess. I despise everyone from Gryffindor, but I may at least tolerate your presence. Consider this your welcome gift,"  he said, so full of himself.She couldn't help but roll her eyes at him again. " Not that I needed your tolerance to go on with my day, but I'll let you believe I do,"  she said as she slammed her book on the table.They knew each other only for some minutes, but she already grew to despise him. He was really mean and annoying.His features hardened. " No one talks to me like that,"  he warningly said." Obviously someoned should,"  she spat back at him.They looked intensely at each others eyes for what felt forever, the hate radiating from the both of them.She really wanted to slap him, but she also find herself wanting to trace her hand on his chiseled jawline." Let's get this done,"  she said through gritted teeth, breaking their eye contact. " I want this to be over as soon as possible,"  she added.Suddenly, she felt a strong hand grabbing her arm. The silver rings on his finger were cold, but she felt her skin burn under his touch."Put that little mouth of yours to rest, or you will regret the moment you stepped foot in to this school,"  he warned, the venomous words falling of his tongue with no shame.She pulled her hand away, breaking free from his touch. " Never lay your hands on me again, Malfoy,"  she spat his name. " Let's get this done," she repeated.Not saying another word to each other, they started cutting the ingredients they needed for the potion.She couldn't help but stare at his veiny hands; The ring he was wearing on his right hand, resembled the Slytherin crest.For some reason, the sight of his hands, made her knees go weak.She gulped hard, and took her eyes away from there." He is the devil himself,"  she thought, as she felt her body heating up." Alright, now as I pour the spider venom in here, you will add everything we have on the table, inside the pot,"  she instructed him.He snorted annoyed, but actually listened. In about ten minutes, the potion was ready.Athena called Slughorn over, so he would check their potion.After studying it for a little bit, he wrote some notes down on a scroll. " This is excellent! Bravo, my children. See, it wasn't so difficult to work with each other, huh?"  he smiled at them.They stared at him, not saying a word. He gave each House ten points, and went to check on the other students.She let out a breath. " Finally,"  she whispered, picking up her stuff." Don't act like you didn't have fun watching me, de Kamp. You enjoyed this,"  he said smiling devilishly." You wish,"  she mumbled and left without saying another word to him.She rushed back to Harry, Ron and Hermione. They didn't seem like they had fun either." Shall we go? I really need some fresh air,"  Hermione commented.Everyone nodded, and they rushed out of the classroom.The first class at Hogwarts was definetely intense.They all went out to the garden, and sat on the green grass. The day was sunny and everyone was enjoying it.Harry and Ron talked about their experience with the Slytherins, while Hermione was listening to them.Athena on the other hand, was quiet. She didn't really pay attention, because she was too busy thinking about Snape. She hadn't seen him since this morning at Dumbledore's office." Athena? Hello?"  Hermione waved a hand in front of her face. " Are you alright?"  she asked worried.She blinked before answering. " Yes, I'm perfectly fine. I just remembered I have to grab a notebook from my room. I'll meet you guys at the next class,"  she promised, standing up from the ground .Athena hurried to the inside of the school, not waiting to hear another word from them.She had to see Snape, but she couldn't actually remember where his office was.After asking some students for instructions, she finally found it.As she put her hand on the door handle to open it, she heard voices. The people that were talking, had a very intense conversation.The door was not fully closed, so she peeked inside.She saw Severus talking to someone, possibly a student. But his tall frame was hiding the other person." You must do as I say, you idiot boy. If you disobey me ever again, it will be your last, I swear,"  he sternly warned." Whatever, I don't need you. I don't have to keep doing those shitty things you ask me to do,"  the venomous voice said. " My father is more powerful than you. We don't take orders from anyone." " Oh, you will obey me. Because I promise you, you won't stand a chance at the next meeting if you don't. Voldemort will make you vanish in a second,"  she heard Snape's voice say. " Now, get lost. I don't want to see your face again for the next hour." When she heard footsteps approaching, she hid herself behind the wall nearby.She almost gasped when she saw Malfoy's tall frame walking away from Snape's office.Furrowing her eyebrows in confusion, she got into the office. Snape's back was turned at her. He hadn't realize that she was here." What the hell are you doing with Malfoy?" Third chapter my lovelies! I am happy that I am finally sharing this story!I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I would love to see your comments!

" Athena! What are you doing here? Someone might see you!"  Snape whispered and rushed to close the door and lock it." I asked you something, Severus! What the hell are you doing with Malfoy? Why are you helping him?"  she asked, furious. She didn't want Snape helping that idiot." That's none of your concern. Your only concern, should be yourself. I went to Diagon Alley again and got you your Gryffindor clothes,"  he said as he gave her a heavy bag. " Burn the Slytherin ones." She took the bag, and let it fall down to the floor. " Severus, we agreed that we will not keep secrets from each other. Tell me what was Malfoy doing here!" He gently grabbed her small shoulders. " Please trust me on this. You will find out soon. But for the time being, I can't tell you. Please, don't make me tell you everything,"  he begged her.She saw the concern in his eyes, and her expression softened. " Alright, I'm sorry. I trust you,"  she tried to smile." Good. Now, go back to your dorm, and burn everything Slytherin related. Make sure Granger doesn't suspect a thing. She has a habit of putting her nose in everyone else's business..." She shook her head, and got the bag with the clothes. " Fine. I'll see you soon I guess..."  she mumbled and turned on her heels. She unlocked the door and left his office with caution.When she reached her room, she locked the door behind her. She took Hermione's cloak off and set it on her bed, and then changed into her brand new Gryffindor uniform.Then, she opened her suitcase, and took the Slytherin clothes out. Her finger traced on the snake emblem; she really grew to love Slytherin, but now, there was no other option.The locket on her neck was burning her skin, but she was used to it. She never took it off. But she will have to hide it from everyone now, especially from Hermione.Athena went back to the Common Room, and thankfully, no one was around. Kneeling in front of the big fireplace, she took the clothes out of the bag, and threw them in to the fire. The flames were eating up the Slytherin clothes, making her heart ache at the sight.When she made sure that everything was set, she got up from the ground and left. The next class was about to begin.Her friends were waiting for her, outside the classroom. " Where in the bloody hell have you been?"  Ron asked. " If you were one more minute late, and the professor came in, you would be in trouble." " I'm sorry guys, I went to Diagon Alley really quick. I had to get my own clothes,"  she lied. "Is the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor that strict?""You'll see," Hermione said. "Nice uniform by the way! I should really get a new one as well."Athena smiled at her. But her expression changed when she saw Malfoy walking inside the classroom, with his group following him.The curiosity was eating up her guts. She really needed to know what Malfoy and Severus were talking about earlier.The blond boy was bad news, and she knew it.  All she wanted, was to protect Severus from him.They all got in to the classroom, and Athena noticed that each desk had just one chair.As she saw her friends taking their seats, she looked around for an empty one. When she found one, she went there.She cursed under her breath when she saw that the only seat left, was behind no other than Draco Malfoy.As she was making her way there, he shot her a death stare. She ignored him, placing her book and her wand on the desk, as she sat down." You really can't stay away from me, can you?"  she heard his harsh voice.She looked up at him. His arm was resting at the back of his chair, his body turned to her. He was smirking, biting on a green apple. Of course, she couldn't help but look at him with a cold stare." Believe me, I'd rather be in Azkaban,"  she blurted out.He chuckled. " I can arrange that for you, if you want,"  he casually said, his eyed darkening.She paused for a minute. " Are you threatening me?" He shrugged. " You asked for it, darling." " Shut up!"  she half yelled, making some heads turn at their direction.He bit the inside of his cheek, his eyes burning in to her's. " You will regret talking to me like that. Remember this,"  he warned, and turned his back at her.She took a shaky breath, and opened her Defense Against the Dark Arts book. She wondered who the professor was this year.When she saw Snape's black clothed figure getting in to the classroom, her eyed widened. Severus hadn't told her that he was teaching DAtDA this year.Oh no." Page 102,"  he just said. Not even a greeting, or a " good morning" .Everyone seemed really scared of Snape, except from her and maybe Malfoy. He was way too foolish to feel fear. He thought that the world belonged to him." Miss Van de Kamp, read the title of this chapter,"  he instructed her.She snapped her head at his direction. She didn't expect him to talk directly to her, on her first day.Taking a deep breath, she looked at the title. " The Three Unforgivable Curses,"  she read." Good. Can you name one of them?"  he questioned her, already knowing the answer." Uhm, yes. One of them is the Cruciatus Curse..."  she answered, straightening her posture." Very good. Mister Malfoy, are we boring you?"  he asked ironically, out of nowhere.Draco's back muscles tensed up. " No,"  he bluntly said." Then pay attention,"  he ordered.Athena laughed silently, but Draco heard her. He half turned to her. " Did you just laugh at me, you filthy mudblood?"  he whispered.That word, was the cherry on top. She couldn't compose herself anymore. " What did you just call me?"  she felt her hands trembling.He turned his whole body to her. " Are you deaf?" " Are you such a coward that you can't repeat yourself? Is little Draco Malfoy scared?"  she whispered, knowing that this would throw him over the edge." Shut up, you fucking mudblood!"  he yelled.Draco felt something heavy hitting the back of his head. He turned around and saw Snape holding a book; he was fuming." If I hear this word in my classroom ever again, I will make sure you get expelled. Detention, mister Malfoy." Athena flashed him a winning smile. Draco wanted to kill her right this instant, like it was her fault." You too, miss Van de Kamp,"  Snape said.She looked at him, wide eyed from the shock. " What?! Why! He called me mudblood! Why should I be punished?" Snape's eyes turned black, as she looked at her sternly and with a little disappointment. " I said detention, miss Van de Kamp. For the both of you. After your classes are over,"  he said and got back to his desk.Everyone was staring at them in shock, but she was staring at Malfoy instead, her jaw clenched. She almost heard her teeth screeching.She didn't say another word to him. Harry and Hermione were looking at her direction worried and angry at Malfoy, at the same time. Ron was silently asleep, oblivious to what was going on.Athena couldn't look at them right now... She felt embarrassed.The tears were pooling in her eyes, but she managed to keep it together for the rest of the class. She hated Malfoy, she really did. He is nothing but trash.After the class was over, she grabbed her stuff, and immediately got out of the classroom. She couldn't face Snape and she didn't want anyone to see that she was crying.Especially Malfoy.Founding the nearest bathroom, she got inside. She left her things by the sink, and washed her face with the cold water.Grabbing the white porcelain, she looked at her reflection in the mirror. What made her cry the most, was the fact that she let Malfoy get under her skin.She barely even knew him! Why did she care so much about what impression he had of her?Athena didn't have the answer to that. Maybe it was the word itself. The word " mudblood"  is a really hurtful thing to call somebody. Even though she knew she was a pure blood witch, the word really hurt her.When Athena felt herself calming down, she grabbed her stuff and left. There were two more classes and she was done for the day.Well, not actually done. She had detention with Malfoy."Fuck,"  she muttered. She had enough of him already, and it was just her first day here.Athena was relieved to see that Malfoy skipped the rest of the classes. Maybe he didn't want to face her until the time of the detention.And she was completely satisfied with that fact.After having lunch with Hermione and the boys, she made her way to detention. Her heart was beating rapidly in her chest, knowing that she will have to face Draco Malfoy again.Arriving at the classroom, she noticed that Malfoy was nowhere to be found. Only Severus was there, expecting them.She approached him, feeling the tears tingling in her eyes. She felt really hurt that he made her go through this." Can you explain to me why I got detention too, when Malfoy should be the only one here right now?"  she asked, her voice trembling.Snape shook his head before talking. " You were both arguing with each other in my classroom, while I was teaching a very important chapter. Of course you will be punished too. I can't favor you in front of everyone." " But you favor him!"  she exclaimed, feeling a lump in her throat. " He will be very pleased that I got detention as well. He will believe that he has some sort of power over me! That he can do whatever he wants to me, and that he will get away with it!" " Calm down, right now. He is coming. Sit,"  he ordered, not showing the least of sympathy to her.She bit the inside of her cheek and looked at him with red eyes. But she obeyed, and took the furthest seat possible.Draco got in to the classroom, fuming with anger. Furious that he had to waste the next two hours here.He was holding his suit jacket in his hand, and his wand as well. His blond hair were messy." Sit down, Malfoy. And don't make a sound,"  Snape warned him, not raising his head from the book he was reading.Draco scoffed, and took a seat across from Athena. They both looked at each other with hate." Thanks to you, I'm wasting my time here,"  he said through gritted teeth." Thanks to me? You called me a mudblood, you psycho!"  she whispered.He barked a laugh. " You are so sensitive. You can't take the truth I guess,"  he shrugged, tapping his fingers on the desk.She furrowed her eyebrows. " You don't even know me! How can you possibly know that detail about me?" " You are a friend of Granger's! That automatically makes you a mudblood, just like her." She couldn't believe the hate emitting from his voice. Why was he such a mean, elitist person?" Don't talk about her like that. She may not be pure blood, but she surely is better than you'll ever be." " Shut up before I make you!" he seethed." I'd love to see you try!" she challenged him." Silence!"  they heard Snape yell, making them both jump. " Malfoy! Come and sit here. Right now!" he commanded, showing an empty chair closer to him.He shot her a last dirty look. "This isn't over,"  he threatened, before going over to where Snape told him.Athena closed her eyes, trying to calm the rapid beating of her heart. Taking a glance at the big clock on the wall, she realised she had one and a half hour left. So, she decided to do her homework, while waiting for the time to pass by.After what felt like ages, she heard Snape's voice. " You can both go. And stay away from trouble." Draco and her got up at the same time, rushing to the door. They bumped into each other, and she rolled her eyes, when he pushed her away, fixing his tie on his way out.She went to the opposite direction, going to the Gryffindor Tower. She really needed to take a shower, and sleep the whole afternoon away.Hermione was not in their room when she arrived there. So she took the stuff she needed, and went to the bathrooms to take a quick shower. After that, she got back to her room, and changed into her pajamas.When her tired body hit the mattress, she felt the sleep taking over her after some minutes. She was truly exhausted.Her sleep was peaceful, until she heard someone calling her name. " Athena, wake up..." Opening her eyes, she saw Hermione looking at her, with a worried look on her face. " Please wake up, something happened..." Athena quickly rose from her bed. " What happened? Is someone hurt?"  she felt her heart beating like crazy.Hermione shook her head. " No, it's not something like that. Just... please, you need to see this." Athena grabbed her robe and put it around her body. " Let's go,"  she said and Hermione nodded, leading the way.They went to the Common Room, and she saw a bunch of Gryffindors standing over the fireplace, looking intensely at something Harry was holding.Athena stopped in her tracks when she saw what Harry had in his hands. It was a piece of black clothing, with a snake emblem on it.They all knew very well what this emblem meant." See? Someone from Slytherin got into our Common Room, and burned their cloak. What is that supposed to mean? Is it a message?"  Ron asked them, worried.Hermione shook her head, eyebrows furrowed. " I have no idea, Ronald. But this doesn't seem good. I have to inform professor McGonagall." Athena was frozen in her place, not being able to utter a word. She was absolutely sure that everything had burned into ashes.She felt so stupid. Severus will be outraged." Athena? Say something,"  Hermione whispered, bringing her back to reality.She blinked and let out a breath. " I'm sorry, I'm just in shock." That wasn't a lie though. She really was in shock, just for a completely different reason.Ron rubbed her arm, comforting her. " It's alright. Slytherins play games like this all the time. Don't worry,"  he reassured her, smiling.Hermione nodded, agreeing with Ron's comment. " I still have to inform McGonagall though. I will go find her. I'll be right back." " I'm coming with you,"  Ron suggested and they left the Common Room together.Harry walked over to Athena, holding the black cloth. " Do you know anything about this?" She froze. " Me? Why would I know anything about this?" Harry shook his head. " I don't know. Maybe Malfoy wanted to mess with you. Because of what happened today at Snape's classroom,"  he suggested." No, I don't think so. I mean, why would he do such thing?" Harry scoffed. " Because he is a coward. He doesn't have the guts to face anyone. He always does things like this." " I have no idea, really. I just want to stay out of trouble. If it's my fault, I'm sorry..." The smile he gave her, made his feautures soften. " It's definetely not your fault. We will find out who did this, and what's behind it." " I'm sure we will,"  she forced a smile. " I've got to get back to bed. It was a long day." " Yes, you do that. I'll see you in the morning." They said goodnight to each other and she run back to her room.What she did, was really stupid and irresponsible. She should have taken the clothes to another place and burn them there, not at the Gryffindor Common Room!Sighing, she got under her warm covers, trying to find a way to fix this.  She shouldn't have let Hermione and Ron go to McGonagall. But she also couldn't let Hermione suspect anything.Athena got out of her bed again, and put some clothes and shoes on. She had to inform Severus, before McGonagall does. He had to find an excuse for this.She run out of her room and tried leaving the tower, without being noticed.She rushed to the Slytherin Dungeon, and to Snape's room. She knocked on the door.The door opened, revealing a puzzled Snape." Athena? What are you doing here at this time? You should be asleep!"  he sternly said." Look, something happened. And I had to tell you first,"  she whispered, out of breath.He let her come inside his room, and closed the door. Worry was now plastered on his face. " What happened, Athena?" She took a deep breath before talking. " Remember the Slytherin clothes you told me to burn?" " Yes? What about them?" " Well..."  she hesitated. " A piece of cloth remained untouched... And it had the Slytherin emblem on it. Harry Potter found out about it, as well as the rest of the Gryffindor students. And Hermione went to inform professor McGonagall..." " Oh Athena..."  he shook his head. " I can't believe I trusted you with this." She felt a stung in her heart. " What's that supposed to mean?" " That I thought of you as a responsible person. But you proved me wrong. Twice. In a day." " You can't talk to me like that, Severus. It was just a mistake,"  she cried." Just a mistake? This could ruin the whole plan! This would get us into a lot more trouble than you think! I shouldn't have trusted you in the first place. This is entirely my fault."The tears were running down her face. She felt horrible. " Severus, please, I'm sorry--" He raised his hand, to keep her from going on. " Just leave. I will fix this. Just... Just go back to your room. Now, Athena." She looked at him, hurt. This was the worst day of her life, there was no doubt." I really am sorry..."  she whispered, and left. She started sobbing as she run away from Snape's room.The Slytherin Dungeon was really cold; she felt shivers down her spine, as she tried to get away from here.But she stopped walking, when she saw Lucius Malfoy, talking with his son. They were arguing.She tried to stay as silent as possible, while trying to hear what they were talking about." You are so stupid, Draco. You let this girl, a nobody, a mudblood as you call her, get you into trouble. I won't tolerate this again. You have to get serious. You have a mission. Don't embarass me like that again,"  he spat.She could see Draco's angry expression, even from so far away. " Yes, father. I promise I won't embarass you again,"  he said.Lucius looked down at his son, satisfied with his answer. " Good. Now, to your room. And stay away from this Van de Kamp; I knew her parents. They got what they deserved. They weren't meant to be Death Eaters." Draco laughed. " They were losers, just like her I guess." Athena felt her blood boiling. She just wanted to go over to the Malfoys and make them regret their words about her and her family.But she composed herself, and remained at her place. Lucius Malfoy left, and Draco got back to his room.She continued her way to get out of the Slytherin Dungeon, but then she decided to walk back to Draco's door instead.Athena felt the need to confront him, to make him regret his actions and his words.As she was ready to put her hand on the handle of his door, it suddenly flew open.She raised her eyes, meeting a pair of furious, blue ones." What the hell do you think you're doing?" Hope you enjoyed this chapter!Much love,Liberty 🤍

Athena didn't even dare to look up from her book, when Draco came inside the classroom. He was surrounded by his friends, as usual.She knew that what she did last week, that night at the Slytherin Dungeon, was stupid and reckless. Malfoy had every right to be furious with her.But she couldn't let his bad behavior affect her life. She had to make him leave her alone, as soon as possible.She had other things to focus on. Soon enough, she would be serving the Dark Lord, and would become a Death Eater. She didn't have time for Malfoy's bullying.It was a usual morning, in class. Athena and her friends were in the classroom, waiting for their professor.Hermione was writing something in her notebook, while Ron and Harry were talking about the Quidditch tryouts, that would start this afternoon." I definitely need another Seeker in our team, in case something happens and I won't be able to play,"  Harry said." Well, do you have anyone in mind?"  Ron asked, while playing with the feather pen in between his fingers.Harry shrugged. " Nope. Not really. Do you?" " Athena played as a Seeker at a team in Cokeworth,"  Hermione said out of nowhere, as she kept writing in her notebook.They all looked at her, and then Athena. " Is that true?"  Harry asked.Athena hesitated. " Uhm, yes, it is. I used to play as a main Seeker,"  she said.When Athena was eleven years old, she found out about a secret team at Cokeworth, where Muggle parents took their wizard children to play.Athena tried out for the team, and she was very good. So, eventually, she became the main Seeker of the team." Wow! That's great! Would you consider trying out as a substitute player?" Harry seemed genuinely excited with the possibility of having Athena on their team, but she was unsure." I don't know, Harry..."  she hesitated." Come on! It's a great idea! It won't take much of your time, because you won't be a main player. I promise to pretend sick once or twice though, so you can play in my place,"  Harry winked playfully at her, making everyone laugh.She bit her lip, before nodding. " Sure. I'd love that." " Great! Do you need any tips or something?"  he offered." No, I think I'm good. I just want to know who are the other Seekers at Ravenclaw, Slytherin and Hufflepuff." Harry's mood changed all of sudden. " Uhm, sure. Why don't you tell her, Ron?" Ron's eyes widened. " What? Why does it have to be me?" Athena looked at them, confused. " Guys, what's going on?" Hermione sighed, and finally put her pen down. " They are just afraid to tell you who the Slytherin Seeker is,"  she rolled her eyes." Well, who is it then?"  Athena was getting really curious.No one spoke a word. They all just looked at someone across the classroom.Athena followed their stare, and saw who they were looking at. " Oh. Malfoy is the Slytherin Seeker. I see." " Will that change your mind?"  Harry asked, worried.She smiled reassuringly. " No, it actually makes me want it more." " Well, that's great!"  Ron commented." But only if you are absolutely sure," Harry insisted.She smiled. " Believe me. This will be his worst day at the Quidditch field." " Don't take it too far though, or I will really start to worry about him," Ron joked and they all laughed.The Astronomy teacher finally got into the classroom. After kindly greeting them, he started the lesson. Athena really enjoyed Astronomy, so the time flew by quickly.When the class finished, she and Hermione decided to go to the library. The Muggle Studies teacher was sick, so they had a free period." Don't forget Athena, the tryouts start today at 4 o'clock sharp. Do you have a broom?"  Harry asked her." No, I don't actually... Will that be a problem?"" No, that's okay, I will let you borrow mine. And if you make it to the team, we can go and get one tomorrow from Diagon Alley," he offered." That's very nice of you, Harry. Thank you! So, I'll see you at the field." " Sure. See you soon." He and Ron left, while her and Hermione made their way to the library." So, what's eating you up these days? And don't try to deny it, I can see that you are not okay for the past week,"  Hermione asked her friend.Athena gulped. " I am fine, Hermione. I am just worried about my parents,"  she lied." Hm, I see. I am here if you need anything, okay?"  she smiled kindly, as she opened the library door." Thank you very much, Hermione. You have been so kind to me since I came here,"  Athena was honest right now. She really liked Hermione and the boys.She actually never had any friends. Snape was more like a father figure and a mentor to her. And maybe Snape's owl, doesn't really count as a friend." Don't mention it. I just like you. Believe me, you would know if I didn't." They laughed lightly and went to the Astronomy section. They got a bunch of books, and carried them to the table. They were assigned a project at Astronomy, so they decided to get over with it, as soon as possible.While she was taking some notes from the book, her mind couldn't help but go back to last week.That night at the Slytherin Dungeon." I asked you a fucking question, you idiot. What the hell are you doing out here, ready to invade my privacy?" He stood tall against her, making her breath hitch. The Adam's apple on his throat was going up and down, and the veins in his blue eyes, were more visible than ever.She crossed her arms in front of her chest. " I came to talk to you. To tell you to drop your nasty attitude towards me,"  she bluntly said, not feeling any fear at all.He put his hand at the side of the door, right next to her. " Do you think that I would ever be afraid of you?"  he mockingly laughed at her. " You must be joking, princess." " Well, I think you should be afraid of me. I am not like these girls you are used to have wrapped around your finger, Malfoy. Stay away from me. And tell your father to keep his mouth shut about my parents!" she hissed, her hands turning into fists.His expression changed from cocky to furious. Nostrils flaring, eyes full of hate.She felt a cold hand wrapping around her throat, and her back pushed against the cold brick wall. " What the fuck did you just say about my father? Say that again, I dare you!"  he slurred.The metal of the Slytherin ring was hurting the skin of her throat, but she didn't care. At this moment, she wasn't afraid of him.The burning sensation she felt on her skin, was not just from his touch, but also from the locket she was wearing. She felt like it gave her more power.Athena started laughing, uncontrollably. Draco looked at her, like she was insane." I said to tell your father to keep his mouth shut. Believe me, he has no idea who he's messing with." She pushed his toned chest away, breaking free from his hold. " Stay away from me, Malfoy,"  she warned again, before leaving him standing there, still in shock." What the actual fuck happened?"  she heard him wonder, making her laugh even more.Her laugh echoed around the Slytherin halls.Draco actually listened to her. For the past week, he acted like she was invincible. And to be honest, that's exactly what she was hoping for.Maybe he got scared because of her behavior. He was used to bully his way out of his problems, not the other way around.But not anymore. He might got teeth, but Athena had teeth too; and she wasn't afraid to show them.Hermione was helping her with the Quidditch uniform. She was a little nervous, but she knew she was good at it, so she was sure that everything would turn out fine." Finally, ready!"  Hermione said. " Wow, it really suits you, Athena!" Athena blushed. " Thanks, Hermione. I don't know what I would do without you,"  she smiled and hugged her.Hermione hugged her back, tightly. " No reason to thank me. You are my friend now,"  she whispered.They looked at each other and smiled. " Okay, let's get you to the field now. I want you to blow their minds away; show them that you can be the main player. If you know what I mean,"  Hermione winked, making Athena laugh. " And don't let Malfoy ruin it for you." " Oh believe me, I won't. Let's go,"  Athena replied and they left their room.The weather was sunny, but a little bit windy. This would definitely make things harder for her today."There you are!"  Harry greeted them. " Are you ready?"  he asked, side hugging Athena." More than ever," she replied with excitement." That's what I wanted to hear! I know you'll be great out there. Make me proud!" Harry gave her his broom, to test it before the tryouts officially start. Athena got up and flew away immediately.The breeze on her skin, made her feel free. She really had missed this feeling.She made her way around the castle, going as fast as she could. She really was a natural at this.As she slowly landed, her eyes went to where the Slytherin team was standing. They were all watching her like hawks.And of course, first in line was the blond trouble. He was leaning on his broom, watching her with a sour expression on his face." Wow, that was great Athena! You really got this. There's no doubt,"  Harry reassured her.She couldn't help but smile, her green eyes were shining with happiness. " Thank you so much for this Harry." He smiled. " No problem. Now let's go, the tryouts start,"  he grabbed her hand gently, and got over to the other members of the Gryffindor team." Alright guys, Athena here will try out as a substitute Seeker. I think there will be no competition, as no one else offered to try out. But I want to see her actually playing. Should we start a friendly game?" They all agreed. The other students that wanted to try out, would be tested later. The Seeker was the most important player at a Quidditch game, so they had to be focused on her through the whole process.All the main players got on their brooms, and Harry got on to one that he borrowed from the other students that were there. As the captain of the team, he would watch the whole game from afar, without interfering.Then the game started. Athena immediately started searching for the Golden Snitch. She was going really smoothly and fast, getting away from the Bludgers, in swift moves.After half an hour of searching for the Golden Snitch, she saw a golden light shining through some clouds. She knew it was there, she felt it.As she flew higher and higher, she saw the little golden flying ball. She almost touched it with her fingertips, but it flew away.She groaned frustrated, but kept on following it. After some minutes of going round and round, she finally managed to close her palm around it." Yes!"  she screamed with excitement.Harry saw her, and went close to her. " Hell yes! That was great Athena!" Before she could answer, she saw something flying behind Harry. It looked like a dark figure. Suddenly, the sun disappeared and the weather instantly got much colder.As cold as death.Her eyes widened in fear, when she realized what the black figure was." Harry! Oh my! A dementor!"  she screamed.Before Harry could react, the Dementor went over to him, sucking out his best memories. His body fell from the broom, and Athena screamed his name.She flew her way down, trying to catch him, before his body fell to the ground.Just seconds before his body touched the grass, Athena managed to grab him, but she couldn't hold him for long.She screamed for help, and thank Merlin, the other players heard her and went to help.They all landed safely. Athena put Harry's broom down, and run over to him, Hermione and Ron following behind her." Harry! Harry! Oh my god!"  she cried, taking him into her arms.Hermione covered her own mouth to muffle her crying, and Ron was in shock. Harry was bleeding and he was unconscious." We must take him to the hospital! Now!"  Athena screamed.One of Harry's teammates, Alexander Hopkins, got Harry into his arms, and rushed inside the castle. Everyone followed him, except from Athena.A sudden dizziness was clouding up her mind, as it started raining. She felt something liquid running over her forehead. After tracing her fingers there, she took a look at them. Her forehead was bleeding.The sight of the blood, made her even more dizzy. She closed her eyes for a second, and took a shaky breath, trying to calm down.Suddenly, she felt someone grabbing her arm. " To the hospital. Now,"  a harsh, yet familiar voice demanded.Because of the state she was in, she didn't recognize it immediately. She just walked, with the stranger's fingers still wrapped around her bicep.It was a familiar touch that was holding her steady. Something cold, something metal; but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.Feeling her knees giving up on her, she kneeled to the ground. She heard a groan. " Don't do this to me, de Kamp,"  the voice mumbled.She felt someone scoop her between their arms. A strong hold, and a strong chest to lay her head on. A rapid heartbeat." Harry..."  she whispered.She felt the chest stiffen. " Of course. It's always him. The hero,"  the voice said with spite.That was the last thing she remembered, before passing out.The whole afternoon passed, and Athena was still unconscious.On the other hand, Harry was awake. He still had to spend the night at the hospital, even though he reassured everyone that he was just fine. But Madam Pomfrey wouldn't take no for an answer.So, the three of them were sitting next to Athena's bed, waiting for her to wake up."She's been like this for too long. Are we sure that this is normal?" Ron asked, worried.Hermione caressed Athena's hair. "She will be okay, Ron. She was pretty shaken up. I mean, she saw the Dementor doing this to Harry, and also tried to save him. It's only normal for her to be like this. She needs rest."Harry shook his head. "It's all my fault..." he whispered, burying his face in his hands.Ron and Hermione looked at him. "What are you talking about, mate? How in the world is it your fault that a Dementor passed the school barriers?" Ron asked again."I always attract trouble, Ron!" Harry whispered yelled, feeling frustration taking over him. "And because of that, I put the people around me in trouble as well," he added, placing his arms on his knees, not looking at them."Don't ever say that about yourself again, Harry. We will always be next to you, no matter what happens. It's no one's fault that You - Know - Who is after you!" Hermione said, feeling overwhelmed. "Never say that again. Do you hear me?"Harry nodded. "Who brought her in here anyway?" he asked, trying to change the subject."Oh, you will be surprised..." Ron said, folding his arms on his chest."Then tell me!"Hermione laughed with no emotion. "Draco Malfoy."Harry's green eyes widened in shock. "What? That's not possible.""Oh, it is... He walked in here, like it was the most normal thing in the world. Then laid her on this bed, and left without saying a word to anyone. I mean, he really freaks me out sometimes," Ron said. "Just like Hermione."Hermione hit his arm, and then turned to Harry. "I was in shock as well. He seemed pretty worried though..." she shrugged.Harry huffed. "Malfoy? Caring for another person that is not himself? Pretty difficult for me to believe it.""Come on Harry... Every person has a caring side..." Hermione said."Not Malfoy though," he disagreed."Why are you two still here? Don't you have a room to be?" a stern voice asked.They all turned their heads, and saw Snape standing there, looking at them with an annoyed face."Miss Granger and mister Weasley, to your dorms. Leave the patients to rest," he ordered them.His tone left no room for them to protest, so they said goodnight to Harry, and left quickly."You too, Potter. Time for bed," Snape said to him."I am not a child, Professor. I can go to bed on my own," Harry replied at the same hostile tone.Snape came closer to him. "Don't give me attitude, Potter. Go to your bed, and leave miss Van de Kamp to rest. She risked her life for you today, I think she deserves a peaceful night. You owe it to her."Harry looked at him with a clenched jaw, but did as Snape told him. He laid on his bed, pulling the covers over his body.Snape moved closer to Athena, his face full of worry. But he couldn't say or do anything in front of Harry, so he just touched her hair lightly. He gave her a faint smile and disappeared.But Harry saw the little caring moment between them. And now, he wanted more than anything for Athena to wake up.She owed him some answers.Okay lovelies, this is our 5th chapter! It's one of my favorites ♥️ I hope you enjoyed it

Trigger warnings: NoneThe next morning, Athena was finally awake. Harry was sitting in a chair beside her bed, helping her eat her pumpkin soup.She was feeling a lot better than yesterday, but she still had that dizziness, so Madam Pomfrey told her to take the day off.The good thing was that she could go back to her room soon." You don't have to feed me Harry..."  she said laughing.He smiled. " Nope, I insist; you saved my life yesterday. That's the least I can do for you in return,"  he replied, as he raised the spoon with the hot soup to her mouth.She smiled before eating. " But are you feeling better?"  she asked, concerned." Yes, don't worry, I feel great. It's not like I am not used to this..."  he bitterly laughed.Athena's expression turned into a sad one. " I know you've been through a lot for the past years. I can't even imagine..."  she mumbled the last sentence." Don't worry,"  he repeated. " Soon I will make Voldemort disappear from our lives. We will be in a better place,"  he smiled and gave her the last spoonful of the soup.She half smiled. " I hope so,"  she lied.She felt like she was torn between her friends and her calling. Athena never had any intentions of making Voldemort's greatest enemy one of the best friends she ever had.But she couldn't betray Severus' trust again. She had to leave her personal feelings to the side, and focus on the plan." So Harry, do you have any idea about who brought me to the hospital?"  she asked, really eager to know.Harry looked at her, a confused look on his face. " You don't remember?" She shook her head no. " If I did, I wouldn't be asking you this, would I?"  she laughed lightly." Uhm... Well, Ron and Hermione told me that the one who brought you here, was, uhm... Malfoy." Athena was in complete shock. " Malfoy? As we say, Draco Malfoy?" Harry nodded. " Yes. The one and only,"  he sarcastically said." Well, that's new..."  she mumbled." Athena, there's something I've wanted to ask you,"  Harry said after a moment of complete silence. He was not looking at her.Her eyebrows furrowed in confusion. " Well, ask away then..." But before Harry could utter another word, Madam Pomfrey appeared, with professor Dumbledore by her side." Athena, Harry! I am glad that you are both well, my children,"  Dumbledore said, as he went closer to them." Thank you, sir,"  Harry replied, with a little smile." Athena, how are you feeling my dear?"  he asked her." I am feeling better, professor,"  she reassured him." Great! When you find the time, please come by my office. We need to talk about something really important. Alright?" She looked at him, a little bit confused. " Uhm, sure, I'll stop by." He smiled. " Excellent. Now Harry, please come with me, my child. We need to discuss something." Harry nodded, and hugged Athena, before leaving with Dumbledore." Alright dear, let me check on you before you go,"  Madam Pomfrey smiled warmly at her.After some minutes, Madam Pomfrey was done with examing her. She also cleaned her wound, and changed her bandage." Everything seems alright with you darling. You can go back to your dorm whenever you feel like it. Just remember to change your bandage daily, and take one pill a day from this bottle, for the next week. It will help you with your dizziness. Okay?" Athena thanked her and got up from her bed, wanting to get out of here as soon as possible. She put her black coat on, took her bag full of her things, and left.As she was making her way to the Gryffindor Tower, she couldn't wrap her mind around what Harry had told her. Draco Malfoy brought her to the hospital? Well, that was a shock. Since when does he care about her?If Harry told her that Draco had left her to die at the field that day, it would make more sense to her.She decided to give no further thought into this. There was nothing sensible with Draco Malfoy anyway.When she finally got to the Gryffindor Tower, she whispered the password to the Fat Lady Portrait, and got inside the Common Room. It was empty; everyone was at their classrooms right now.She walked up the stairs, and got to her room. The first thing she did, was to go to her drawers. Opening the first one, she searched for a very specific little box.When she finally found it, she unlocked it and saw that her locket was still in there. Thankfully, she got it off her before going to the field yesterday.She put it around her neck and felt better in an instant. She traced it with her fingertips, as she was looking at her reflection in the mirror.                                                                      Draco was at the Room of Requirement, waiting for Snape.He was eager to know what he would ask him to do this time. He was growing really impatient. All he wanted, was to finally take action, to do something that it would actually be important." You heard me for once and appeared on time,"  he heard his voice say.He looked at him. " That's all I've been doing for the past months, with no result,"  he bitterly replied." Are you doubting my methods, Malfoy?"  he asked with no expression on his face." Just tell me what the hell you want me to do this time." " Tomorrow is the day, Malfoy. You are meeting the Dark Lord." He smiled evilly. " Finally!" Snape looked at him with pity, but didn't say anything. " The meeting will take place at your Manor. Be there at twelve o'clock sharp. I will make sure to justify your absence to the other teachers." Draco huffed. " Like I care about them,"  he spat.Snape looked at him intensly. " You should care, you idiot. This school is your cover. Try not to blow it up."He couldn't help but roll his eyes. " Yes, whatever..."  he mumbled." Now that we got this out of the way. What happened yesterday at the Quidditch field?"  Snape asked." What do you mean?" " With Potter and that new girl, Van de Kamp. What happened?" He huffed. " Why should I know what happened to these two idiots?" " Because you took the girl to the hospital, as Madam Pomfrey told me. You saw what happened, didn't you?"  he insisted.Draco's fists clenched to his sides. " I never did such thing. I have no idea what you're talking about,"  he said through gritted teeth.Snape raised an eyebrow. " Is that so?" " Yes,"  he bluntly said. What was his problem anyway? Why he wanted to know what happened?" Good. Because I want you to stay away from that girl,"  he warned.Draco's eyebrows furrowed in confusion. " I just told you, I don't care about her or anyone else. I only care about myself. There's no need to ask me to stay away from her. She can die in front of me, and I won't even flinch." " Good,"  he replied again." Why do you care so much? She is just trash, another Gryffindor that will be forgotten, as soon as the Dark Lord steps foot into this pathetic excuse of a school." " That's none of your business. Back to your class now. And remember what I told you." Before Draco could answer, Snape left him all by himself again.Why would Snape want to know what happened to her, and why did he tell him to stay away from her?" I will get to the bottom of this,"  he thought, as left.Athena was on her way to Snape's office. The letter he had sent to her with his owl, was demanding her to go there immediately.She was sure that something serious was going on, so she wasted no time getting there. The door was already open, waiting for her." Severus?"  she softly called his name.He was staring out of the window, when he heard her voice. He immediately turned around and when he saw her, he went over to her, embracing her tight. " My little girl... Finally, I can have you in my arms. Are you alright?"  he whispered in her hair.She felt herself relaxing in his arms, she felt safe. Snape was her father after all. Maybe not her biological one, but he raised her. He will always be her father." I am... You don't have to worry..."  she reassured him, hugging him back." You know I will always worry about you..."  he mumbled. " Let me look at you..."  he pushed her away gently, looking lovingly at her.She smiled. " I am perfectly fine, Severus. Please, don't worry anymore." He nodded. " You are a woman now, my dear. You have grown so much. I am really proud of you. Never forget that,"  he told her." I know..." He smiled at her. " Now, listen to me. Tomorrow is the next Death Eaters' meeting. And you are coming with me,"  he said with caution, so he could see her reaction.Athena's eyes widened with excitement. "Finally!"  she exclaimed. " It was about time!"Snape looked at her, unsure. He sighed before continuing. " So, go get your stuff. We will return to our home for now. You'll be back in two days. Go tell Granger and everyone else that you are going to The Netherlands for the weekend, to visit your parents." She nodded. " Sure, I'll go pack my stuff now." " Good. Return here as soon as possible. Go,"  he told her.She hugged him one last time, and run to the Gryffindor Tower. Harry, Ron and Hermione were in the Common Room." Hey guys,"  she greeted them." Athena! Where have you been?"  Hermione got up from her seat and hugged her. " Are you feeling better?" " Much better,"  Athena replied. " I came to tell you that I'll be gone for the weekend. I am going to visit my parents." Hermione's expression turned into a worried one. " But, isn't it dangerous for you to go back there right now? With everything that's going on?" " Well, it is actually. But I really have the need to see them. I missed them,"  she said, feeling bad for lying to them. But she had to." I understand,"  Hermione said. " Take care of yourself, okay?" " Of course. I will be back before you know it." Athena hugged them all, and after saying their goodbyes, she went to her room. She packed some clothes, the book she was reading right now, and of course her wand.Changing into something more comfortable, she left her room, and hurried back to Snape's office.They apparated and got to Cokeworth quickly. She missed her house a little bit.They went inside together, and she offered to cook something for dinner. Snape went to his office. He said he had to take care of some things.After the dinner was ready, they sat down and ate in silence.Athena was weirded out by Snape's behaviour; he didn't seem as eager for tomorrow as she thought he'd be." Severus, is everything alright?"  she asked him, finishing her food.He looked at her. " Yes. Everything is alright. The real question is, if you are fully prepared for tomorrow,"  he said, narrowing his eyes at her.She huffed. " What kind of question is that? You have been helping me prepare for this moment my whole life. I mean, if you don't think I am ready, you should tell me." He shook his head. " No, I believe that you are ready. I just want you to go have a good sleep. It's going to be a long day tomorrow, I need you to have a clear mind." " Of course. I won't disappoint you." He faintly smiled. " I trust your word." " So, where is the meeting taking place?"  she asked curious, as she was sipping on some water.He hesitated a bit before answering. " Malfoy Manor,"  he finally replied.Athena almost chocked on her water. " Malfoy Manor? Do you mean Draco Malfoy's house?" " Yes. Who else's?" " Is Draco going to be there? Is he going to be a Death Eater as well?"  she asked, her voice low." Yes, he will." To say that she was shocked, was an understatement. " You never told me this! What the hell, Severus! Why would you hide this from me?" He opened his mouth to reply, but he was cut off by her. " That's what you were talking about in your office that day. You are helping him!"  she almost yelled. She was really furious." Athena--" " No! No, don't speak, don't say another word to me! Why are you helping that asshole? He treated me like trash since day one! He hates me! Why would you help someone who hates me?" She couldn't contain herself anymore. Her voice was trembling. She felt betrayed." Athena, calm down, let me explain!" " No!"  she yelled again, getting up from her chair. " No. I don't want to hear another word from you..."  her voice was soft now, tears were streaming down her face.She shot him a last hurt look, before running upstairs to her room, and locking the door behind her.Snape froze in his place, not being able to move. The truth is he was expecting a bad reaction from her, but not at this rate.He stood up from his seat, and went upstairs to her room. " Athena, please come out. Let me explain. You took this the wrong way." Silence."Athena!"  he repeated her name.Silence again.He sighed. " Alright. I'll be in my office if you need me. Take some rest,"  he soflty said and left.Athena was lying on her bed, hugging a pillow and crying in silence. She felt the urge to get out of this house, and maybe find Malfoy and punch him on his perfectly shaped face." Fucking asshole..."  she whispered, before drifting off to sleep.And that night, she dreamed of him for the first time.Another chapter for you!

*⚠️TW: Mention of blood, mild violence, mentions of masochism/sadism⚠️The next morning came. Athena was awake since 8 o'clock; she was too nervous to sleep any longer.She got dressed in all black, she went downstairs. Snape was not around.After some coffee, she took the " Daily Prophet"  newspaper of the day.The front page had a headline with big letters that read " DEATH EATER TERROR CONTINUES" . A picture with Voldemort's Dark Mark on the sky, was accompanying the title." Well, you might as well get used to it..."  she mumbled, while taking the very first sip of caffeine." You are up early,"  she heard Snape's voice.She refused to look at him. She just kept on reading the headlines. " Yes, I couldn't sleep any longer,"  her tone was cold.Snape sighed. " Athena, please. You didn't let me explain." She shook her head. " Fine. Then explain." He sat across from her, and took her hand in his. " Listen to me carefully; I am only helping Malfoy, so I can keep you as safe as possible." " What--" He cut her off. " Let me finish. Please." She sighed. " Go on..."  she whispered." I know this might sound cruel, but I couldn't just sacrifice you like that to the Dark Lord's needs. I have to shield you somehow. And Malfoy, could be that shield." Her eyes widened. " What are you talking about? I don't understand." " If this ends badly... If, for any reason, you can't accomplish whatever he asks you to do... I can blame everything on Malfoy and his irresponsibility. And he will punish him, instead of you." Athena was now more shocked than ever. " What? How can you say that? Are you serious right now? You are going to sacrifice him, if I do anything wrong? This is inhuman, Severus! It's a disgusting thing to do! I won't let you do this!"  she stood up from her seat. " I can't believe you ever thought I would agree!" Snape stood up from his chair as well. " This is the only way, Athena. I won't risk your life. And this is what it's going to happen, no matter if you approve of this, or not. End of discussion!" Her vision suddenly blurred from the tears she was violently holding back. " I can't believe this. I feel like I don't know who you are anymore..." " I don't care about that at the moment. I only care about your safety. Now, go to your room until we leave. I'll be in my office." He left her alone, without another word. Athena cupped her mouth, trying to stop herself from crying.She might hate Draco, but she couldn't let another person take the fall for her, if she ever did anything wrong.Athena felt hopeless. This didn't turn out the way she hoped for. This was supposed to be the most important day of her life. She wasn't supposed to be crying about someone like Draco Malfoy.Maybe she should warn him about it. To let him know that he was just a pawn, that he was disposable.But of course she couldn't do that. Of course she knew this was wrong, but she still couldn't put a person she met a week ago, over Severus.She sniffled her nose and wiped her tears away. This was the last time she would cry over someone that hates her guts. She has to focus on her own life.Draco was earlier at the Malfoy Manor, as his mother Narcissa asked him to.When he got inside, he was greeted by her. " My dear son, I have missed you so much,"  she hugged him tightly." Nice to see you again, mother,"  he whispered. He felt right at home when he was in her embrace.She smiled at him, as she took him by the hand and led him to the big room, where the meeting would take place. " Everything is ready, as you see. Me and your father are so proud of you, my son,"  she smiled and caressed his cheek.He huffed. " Sure. Especially father,"  he sarcastically said.Narcissa's expression fell. " Don't be like that, Draco. You know your father. He is not one to show emotions. But he really is proud of you, I can assure you,"  she gave him a sad smile." If you say so..."  he mumbled." I just want you to be brave. And accept whatever the Dark Lord asks of you. I don't want you to cower." He shook his head, not meeting her eyes. " I will do as you and father wish... Don't worry about that,"  he said in a low voice." Bravo, my boy. I knew you wouldn't disappoint me,"  she said as she fixed some locks of his hair that were falling on his forehead. " Now, go get some rest before the meeting. Try to clear your mind out a little. Have you eaten?" Draco nodded. " I am fine, you don't need to worry. I will see you in a bit,"  he said and lightly kissed her cheek.He went upstairs to his room. The time had come, and he was more impatient than ever.Suddenly, a loud sound was heard, and black smoke filled the sky. And he knew exactly what it was.Death Eaters.They had arrived.The Dark Lord would be here soon.                                                                 Athena was really nervous, but at the same time, excited to finally meet the Dark Lord.With Snape by her side, they arrived at Malfoy Manor. Her jaw dropped at the sight of the enormous house.Narcissa went to greet Severus, but she was in it for a surprise; she didn't know that Snape would bring another guest to the meeting." Severus, welcome. You brought someone with you, I see. Is the Dark Lord informed?"  Narcissa asked, with a little fear in her eyes." Yes, Narcissa. You don't have to worry. I will explain everything,"  Snape reassured her.She gave Athena a faint smile. " And what is your name, my dear?"  she asked her.Athena felt her heart beating fast. " I am Athena Van de Kamp, Mrs. Malfoy. Really pleased to meet you,"  she answered." You too, my dear. Please, come in,"  Narcissa said as she opened the door wider for them to enter. " Van de Kamp, you said? I knew I've heard that name before. Do you have any relations with the late Cornelius Van de Kamp and his wife?" Athena gulped. " Yes, Mrs. Malfoy. They were my parents,"  her voice was a little shaky.Narcissa's face softened. " Oh dear, I am so sorry. My house is open for you if you ever need anything." Athena smiled at her. She was so sweet, how is it possible that she was Lucius's wife and Draco's mother?" Thank you so much, I really appreciate it." Narcissa nodded and looked at Snape. " Shall we?"  she asked as she started walking to the big room where the other Death Eaters were seated.Everyone was already there, except from Voldemort. When Narcissa entered the room with Snape and Athena by her side, all eyes were on them. And they were not friendly." Who is this girl, Sissy?"  a voice that made Athena's skin shiver asked.It was Bellatrix Lestrange, Narcissa's sister." This is Athena Van de Kamp. She is the daughter of Cornelius and Ella Van de Kamp. Severus will explain everything as soon as the Dark Lord arrives." Athena was feeling really uncomfortable with everyone staring at her. But one certain stare, made her feel like her face was burning.Draco's.Snape gently touched the small of her back, and led her to the two remaining seats. They sat down together, Athena not daring to look at anyone in the room." You brought a child to the meeting with the Dark Lord? What is wrong with you, Snape?"  Fenrir Greyson laughed, resulting into others laughing along.Snape shot him a death stare. " I don't remember asking for your permission, Greyson. The Dark Lord is already informed, therefore we don't need your opinion." That made Greyson shut up, while the other Death Eaters were caught up to another conversation, not wanting to be under Snape's rage.Athena raised her eyes from her hands, and took a look at Draco Malfoy. He was looking at her like she was his worst enemy.She raised an eyebrow at him, wanting to make sure he understood that she didn't give a damn about his opinion. She didn't come here to play.This was a serious matter to her. If he thought of this as chance of war between them, it was his own problem to solve." Ah, as I see, all of my dear friends are here today, as well as new ones. I am glad..."  a cold, soulless voice filled the dark room.Athena's senses were more tensed than ever. She raised her head, and saw the Dark Lord standing there, an evil smile on his face.And then, she looked at Draco again; he seemed scared. It was the first time she saw him being scared. His father and mother had the same fear in their eyes.They didn't seem happy that this meeting was taking place in their home, there was no doubt about that.But who could blame them?" I would like to introduce you to our new friends. Athena Van de Kamp is Severus' niece and Draco Malfoy is the son of our dear Lucius and Narcissa. Welcome, my children." Athena gulped and looked at him, trying to stay composed. " My Lord,"  she simply said." Severus..."  he said, not taking his eyes off of her, " Bring both children here next to me,"  he ordered him.Athena saw him hesitating, but they both knew there was no turning back now. He stood up from his chair, and Athena followed his action. Draco was frozen in his seat.Snape looked at him. " Draco,"  he simply said.Draco looked at him, wide eyed. But he stood up as well.Severus' grabbed both of their arms and got them closer to Voldemort." Finally, I get to meet you, beautiful Athena. I am honored that you chose to serve me. Severus here told me that you were very eager to become one of us..."  he venomously spoke." Yes, my Lord..."  she raised her head and looked at him with courage. " I am ready." " Excellent, my dear. How about you, Draco? Are you as ready as our friend here?" Draco was visibly shaking and he looked at Athena for a brief moment. She shook her head at him, trying to give him courage. He seemed like he really needed someone to ensure him that everything was going to be alright." Yes, my Lord. More than ever,"  he finally replied, his expression turning cold." Very well,"  he smiled sardonically. " Severus, please, do the honors. Give our children here what they both want. Give them the Dark Mark" .An evil laughter echoed across the room. It was Bellatrix.Snape turned to Athena first. She could hear his heart beating fast. He looked like this was the worst moment of his life.She furrowed her eyebrows in confusion. Isn't this the moment they both have been waiting for so long? What is happening to him?" Roll up your sleeve,"  he ordered, his voice cold, no emotion showing.Athena did as she was told. Her heart was about to explode.Snape gulped slowly, before placing his wand on Athena's left forearm. She closed her eyes, waiting for the sensation of something burning into her skin.The feeling didn't take long to fill her whole body. She slowly opened her eyes, watching Voldemort's Dark Mark being imprinted on her skin forever.She bit her lower lip, trying to control her screams. The taste of blood filled her mouth.The feeling was unbearable. Athena wished that she could die on the spot, so that she doesn't feel this indescribable pain any longer.But before she could react, everything was over. She raised her eyes to Snape, who looked at the Mark with pain in his eyes." Excellent. Bravo my child. You were truly born for this..."  Voldemort was now behind her, touching her shoulders.As Snape turned to do the same to Draco, Voldemort's voice stopped him. " No, Severus. Let Athena do it. Let her be the one who brings her friend to the dark side." Snape and Draco looked at them in shock. But Athena was calm. " He is not my friend..."  she harshly said, as she looked at Malfoy with hatred." Oh, that won't be a problem my dear. Just do it. Show everyone how much you love to cause pain to other people..."  he whispered, only for her to hear. " You are just like me. I can feel it. You and I, we are the two sides of the same coin." Athena smiled evilly. At this very moment, she felt like she was a whole different person, like she was reborn." Raise up your sleeve, Malfoy,"  she ordered him. At this moment, she couldn't even recognize her own voice.Draco looked like he was about to pass out. Athena could see his chest rising and falling due to his rapid breathing, and his heart was beating like crazy.Athena realized that she could hear every little sound in this dark room.Draco gulped, but he came closer to her. He raised the left sleeve of his black shirt with trembling hands.Snape was watching the whole scene, unable to react. He really thought that the Athena he knew, was gone for now.Athena took her wand out, and pressed it on Draco's porcelain skin. She murmured the words, and the Mark started burning into his skin.Draco hissed from the pain he felt, but tried to cover it up. Athena felt a pleasure she had never felt before.She really enjoyed causing him pain.In a few seconds, everything was over. The Dark Mark was on Draco Malfoy's skin now.They both had become Death Eaters.Athena opened her eyes, waking up from a very dark, vivid dream she just had.Her forehead was covered in a thin layer of sweat. She got up from her bed, and drank some water from the glass she had beside her. Her throat was really sore and dry.The dream was still very fresh on her mind. It was her, next to a dark figure, that instructed her to kill everyone on her passage. And she obeyed, with no hesitation whatsoever. The dream was filled with the hissing of a red eyed snake, that was following her everywhere she went.Athena took the locket off of her neck, because it was burning her so much, it was unbearable. Since yesterday that she joined Voldemort, the locket was hurting her skin more than ever.Raising up her left sleeve, she took a look at the Dark Mark, wanting to make sure it was real.She looked at the clock on her nighstand; it showed that it was 3 o'clock in the morning.Her mind flew without her will to Draco. How was he spending his first hours as a Death Eater? Could he get any sleep?It's not that she cared about his wellbeing; she just wanted to know if his first night, was any different than hers. She refused to even think that she would ever feel the same things as him.After all, the Dark Lord told her that they were the two sides of the same coin. He didn't say this to Draco. She was superior to him.Her feet dragged her to the garden. A breath of fresh air, was what she needed the most right now.The air was blowing through her hair, and was cooling her heated skin. As she was taking a slow walk around the garden, she thought she heard the sound of footsteps approaching behind her.Before she could turn around, she felt a strong hand closing her mouth. She felt the taste of metal on her lips and her tongue.Athena tried to scream, as she felt another hand snaking around her stomach. Her back was then pushed to a strong chest, with a rapid heartbeat.A heartbeat she was sure she had heard before." You thought I would let you get away with after what you did to me?"  a harsh voice whispered threateningly in her ear.Her nostrils were instantly filled with the smell of mint and cologne.She tried to scream again, but it was no use; the hold on her lips was very strong.The two hands grabbed her arms, and spun her around.And then she saw the well known pair of blue eyes, looking at her, full of spite and disgust." Malfoy? Are you crazy?! What the hell are you doing in my garden?"  she half yelled, getting her wand out of her pocket, ready to attack him if needed." I will fucking kill you,"  he hissed and pushed her up against the fence. Her wand fell onto the wet grass. " I swear, I will fucking kill you, Athena Van de Kamp,"  he threatened, as his long fingers wrapped around her throat." What the hell is your problem?" she demanded to know, not being able to speak clearly. She was running out of breath." You are my problem. You humiliated me infront of everyone,"  his eyes were turning gray with each word he spoke. His minty breaths were fanning her face with fury.But Athena was now starting to get really afraid.She tried to push him away, but there was no use. He was way too stronger than her. " Let. Me. Go,"  she tried to breathe." Why should I? Give me a fucking reason why I shouldn't kill your right this instant,"  he growled." Because then the Dark Lord will kill you. Or Snape. You can choose,"  she whispered.She saw his hard feautures turn into scared ones. His fingers loosened around her neck, but he didn't take his hand away." Now tell me why the hell you are here,"  her voice was still a whisper." You know why. You gave me the Dark Mark. Who the hell gave you the right to do this to me? A filthy mudblood, giving a Malfoy the Dark Mark?" " Are you fucking deaf?"  she rhetorically asked and pushed his chest away. " The Dark Lord himself asked me to do this. I did you a favor!"  she laughed with anger. " You got what you wanted so desperately. Why do you care if I was the one who gave it to you?" " Don't even think for a moment that you have some kind of power over me. I will fucking kill you the next time you dare to even look my way. Remember that,"  he warned with his index finger raised at her.And then he disappeared, before Athena could reply.Athena's hand raised to touch her neck, at the very same spot that his hand was some minutes ago.This might seem or sound masochistic, but for some reason...She was already missing the feeling.Okay, this is the 7th chapter lovelies!

I want to thank everyone who votes, comments and has added my book to their libraries!Every comment, kudos and share, are deeply appreciated!Much love to you all xx

Athena didn't return to her bed after what happened with Malfoy at the garden; she was way too tense after the incident.Of course, she didn't say a word to Snape, because she knew he might return to the Manor and make Malfoy pay for what he did to her. He would do it in a heartbeat.Severus left early this morning at seven, and he hadn't returned since then. It was now 10 o'clock and the rain was pouring outside. The water was falling with force on the windows of the Snape residence at Cokeworth.Athena was eating breakfast, while trying to finish her Astronomy project, a hot mug with tea by her side.She heard the main door open and close with a loud bang.Snape was back.He came inside the living room, and Athena noticed he was in a really angry state." Severus? What's wrong ?"  she asked concerned, putting her feather pen down.He looked at her, not sure if he should respond or not. But she would find out sooner or later any way. So, he might as well rip the bandage off now." No, it's not,"  he finally said." What happened?"  she asked.He sighed and took a seat next to her. " I had something to arrange at the Ministry this morning. But when I arrived there, I run into Lucius Malfoy. And he told me something rather alarming..." Athena nodded her head, signaling for him to continue with his story." The Dark Lord has given Draco Malfoy his main task this morning..." Athena was taken aback from the news. "For real? What did he ask him to do? Tell me!" Snape looked at her with a distressed expression. " He was asked to kill Albus Dumbledore." Athena froze on her spot, feeling her mind clouding up. " Oh my god..."  she said breathless, after some seconds of silence." But first, he has to repair the Vanishing Cabinet at the Room of Requirement. So when the time comes, the Death Eaters will be able to get into the Hogwarts with no obstacles." Athena bit her lower lip before speaking. " How is he going to kill Dumbledore, Severurs? This the most difficult thing he could ask of someone... Will Draco manage to do it?" Severus shook his head. " That's exactly what I am afraid of; I believe he won't. That's why I am worried..." he replied. "I don't want him to ask this from you, eventually. So, for his own sake, I hope that when the time comes, he will be able to do it." " I don't know Severus... Draco Malfoy might be a lot of things, but I wouldn't think of him as a murderer..."  Athena whispered. " I don't believe he has the guts to do something like this." Snape laughed with no emotion. " Athena, I think you haven't quite understood what happened yesterday. From now on, you and Malfoy are potential murderers. If the Dark Lord asks you to kill someone, you have to do it. Or else, your own life is ending." " I am aware... I just didn't think this time would come so soon..."  she shrugged.There was a moment of silence, before Athena spoke again. " Uhm, I need a certain book from your library for my Astronomy project. Can you help me find it?"  she asked." Sure, let's go." They both stood up from their seats and went to Snape's office. While they were looking for the book Athena needed, they heard a bang on the door.They looked at each other, confused. " I will go check who is at the door. You stay here,"  he ordered her and left quickly.Athena stayed quiet, trying to listen to what was going on. She heard fast footsteps approaching.Snape got inside the office, his index finger on his lips, signaling for Athena to not say a word." Just give me a minute,"  he said for someone to hear. He then turned to Athena. " Hide to the secret passage behind these two bookcases. Now!"  he whispered to her.Athena nodded, and casted the necessary spell. The two bookcases opened in front of her, and she got inside the passage they formed.When they closed behind her, she heard Snape's voice calling the guests inside the office.Athena couldn't see a thing from here, but she could at least hear everything clearly." So, Narcissa, Bella,"  she heard his voice again, "To what do I owe this visit?" " Severus, I am so sorry for coming to your house uninvited. But I really need your help,"  she heard a sweet voice say." That was definetely Narcissa,"  Athena thought." How can I help you?"  Severus asked, a little bit confused.There was a moment of silence. " I want to ask something really important of you. I need you to help my boy. To help my Draco..."  her voice broke when she spoke her son's name." What is the issue with Draco?" " Sissy here is really worried about him,"  Bellatrix stepped in. " She is not happy with the task Draco was given by the Dark Lord. We need you to make sure that he will make it through." " I think I am already doing enough for him. Aren't you happy with the help I have offered to your family until now?" " Severus, please, he needs your guidance... Hw can't do this all alone. He's just a boy..."  Narcissa's voice broke again.Athena's heart was beating really fast. She didn't like where this was heading." Narcissa, I can't change the Dark Lord's mind. You know that. But it might be possible for me to help out Draco somehow..." " Swear to it,"  Bellatrix spoke again. Athena's breathing hitched. " Make the Unbreakable Vow..."  she said, her tone evil and cold.Athena could picture her smiling sardonically. " Or else, it's just empty words. He will slither back into his hole when things get tough. Coward..."  she sung the last word.Athena wanted to get out from her hiding spot this instant, and stop this madness. But she knew this would be dangerous for her and Severus as well. So, she remained silent." Take out your wand, Bella,"  she heard Snape's voice order her.Athena heard Narcissa's heels clicking, as she went closer to Snape.Then Bellatrix started speaking the words of the Unbreakable Vow.Athena was listening in silence, trying to hold her tears back." Will you, Severus Snape, swear to watch over Draco Malfoy, as he tries to fulfill what the Dark Lord asked of him to accomplish?" " I will,"  Snape said." And will you make sure he stays safe, and protect him from any harm?"  she continued." I will,"  he repeated." And if Draco won't be able to complete his task, will you personally carry out the deed the Dark Lord has ordered Draco Malfoy to perform?" " I will..." Bellatrix laughed like a demon. " See, Sissy? He's not a coward after all..." " I am really thankful for this, Severus. I will never forget it..."  Narcissa promised.Then, she heard two pairs of footsteps walking away from the office. When Athena heard the front door close, she got out of her hiding spot.She felt her legs giving up on her, as she run over to Severus. He managed to catch her before she fell.They both kneeled down, as Athena was sobbing into his arms. Snape wasn't speaking; He was just caressing her black hair, trying to comfort her." Why did you do this, Severus? Why did you put your life on the spot like that?"  she cried. " If something happens and you die, what will I become? You will leave me all alone!"Snape felt his heart breaking into a million pieces. " Nothing is going to happen, my love. I won't be going anywhere, you know I will always be here for you,"  he whispered, resting his cheek on top of her head." Why would you agree to something like this? How are you supposed to kill Dumbledore if Draco fails?"  she mumbled." That's why you need to make sure that he will carry out his deed..."  he whispered again. " Help me out with this, Athena. Keep a close eye on him, and tell me everything he does. Alright?" Athena got out of his embrace, and looked at him with teary eyes. " I will do whatever it takes. I promise. I won't lose you..."  her voice was unsteady.Snape gave her a sad smile, without saying anything else.He helped her get up from the floor, and then sat her down on the sofa. " I will bring you some water,"  he caressed her cheek and left.Athena wiped her tears, as she felt hate taking over her. If she had Draco Malfoy in front of her now, she would kill him in an instant. He has made her life a living hell." I will make you regret the day you met me..."  she whispered to herself. "I promise you that."The weekend had passed, and Athena was already back to Hogwarts.She and Hermione had just finished their classes for the day, and they were on their way to find the boys at the Great Hall.When they finally arrived there, they went over to their table. Harry was sitting next to Ron, and Ginny was also with them.They were caught up in a conversation about tomorrow's Quidditch game. It was the first of this year's season, so it was the main subject of discussion for every student involved." Hey guys,"  Hermione greeted them, as she sat down next to Ginny, and Athena sat between  Harry and Ron." How was Muggle Studies class?"  Harry asked.Athena shrugged. " We actually had a free period, for the third time in a row. I don't know what is going on with professor Burbage, she hasn't showed up for days." Ron and Harry looked like they had no idea. " I wouldn't know. I always skip her class, I found it pretty boring. Thankflully McGonagall hasn't found out yet..."  Ron said, and they all laughed, except from Hermione." Oh, Ronald! This is not funny at all! You shouldn't be skipping classes! They all have their importance!"  she scolded him." Chill, Hermione. It's not like I don't know the things she teaches. You and Harry talk about Muggle stuff all the time!" Hermione shook her head, disagreeing. " Still. It's not right,"  she insisted.After Ron and Hermione argued for some minutes, making the others laugh uncontrollably, they started eating their lunch.As Athena was pouring some juice in her glass, she saw Malfoy at the Slytherin table; he was sitting all alone, lost in his thoughts. He looked like he hadn't slept in days.She knew that he was really worried about the deed the Dark Lord offered him, but she didn't feel sorry for him. He knew where he was getting himself into. They both did." So, a little bird told me that your birthday is coming up soon,"  Hermione said out of nowhere, making Athena look at her." Uhm, how did you even know?"  Athena laughed, feeling uncomfortable." Oh believe me, I know everything I need to know about you,"  Hermione said in a serious tone, making Athena wide her eyes." What do you mean by "everything"?"  she asked, trying to stay calm.Hermione laughed with her reaction. " Silly, I am just messing with you!" Athena laughed, feeling relieved. " Oh, you got me there for a minute, I give you that." " Why though? Is there anything you are keeping from us?"  Harry asked, but he didn't seem like he was joking.Athena gulped. " No! Why would I hide anything from you guys?" Harry shrugged. " Everyone has secrets." " Well, I don't. So stop giving me the third degree,"  Athena warned." Guys, relax! I was meant for it to be a joke. Don't fight with each other out of nowhere!"  Hermione begged.Athena exhaled. " We are not fighting,"  she said, giving them a fake smile. She was really upset." So, back to your birthday now,"  Ron interfered, wanting to clear the air. " When is it?" " Uhm, this Saturday. October 7th,"  Athena replied." Cool! How are you celebrating?"  Ginny asked." Uhm, I haven't planned anything to be honest, but we can go to " The Three Broomsticks"  in Hogsmeade for some Butterbeer. Are you guys in?"  she offered." Yes, that sounds nice!"  Hermione agreed.Athena smiled. " Great! You are all invited." They all smiled at her, while Harry was a little bit skeptical." Harry? Are you coming to " The Three Broomsticks?"  on Saturday?"  Athena asked, wanting to make amends.Harry gave her a little smile. " Of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world." " It's settled then!" Athena smiled back at him.After they finished their lunch, they all went back to their dorms.They needed some sleep, because at 10 o' clock, their whole class would meet the Astronomy teacher at the forest. They would go there to observe a certain star, that was visible only on this October night." Hermione?"  she whispered to check if her roommate was asleep." Hm?"  Hermione said." Did professor McGonagall find out anything about the Slytherin cloth Harry discovered at the Common Room?"  she asked, anxious about the answer." Hm no, not really. I mean, she told me she took care of it. I don't know, but I really don't like this..."  she whispered.Athena silently sighed, feeling relieved. " Yes, me neither..." They didn't talk anymore until the time came for them to go to the forest. They got dressed in their uniforms and cloaks, and went to meet Harry and Ron at the Common Room.The four of them walked to the forest together. Some students were already there. Malfoy and his friends too.Athena avoided looking at him, because she really didn't know if she could contain herself.She desperately wanted to punch him in the face, making him beg for her to stop." Well Potter, it seems like you made it out alive again. What a pity,"  Malfoy's voice was heard, and then laughters from his idiot group of friends followed. "The Dementors really have a thing for you, don't they?"Athena felt her blood boil, as she and her friends turned around to face Malfoy's cocky smile." Shut up, Malfoy. I really have no time for your shit right now,"  Harry spat.He laughed. " I will shut up, when I want to shut up. I suggest you keep your mouth shut instead, or I will make sure my father puts you to the deepest cell in Azkaban,"  he said in a dark tone. " Just like your godfather Serius Black, the killer, deserved,"  he added and spat on the ground, to make Harry even more angry." Don't speak about Serius. Don't mention his name ever again!"  Harry attacked him, grabbing him by his cloak.All the students there started chanting: " Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!"" Ron! Do something!"  Hermione screamed, as Draco punched Harry on the nose." What do you want me to do?"  Ron asked, shook." Malfoy, stop it already!"  Athena yelled, as she run over to them.She got between them, pushing both of their chests away. The two boys were fuming with rage, ready to slit each others throats.Athena wrapped her arms around Harry, taking him away. " He's not worth it, Harry,"  she said as they started walking away from Malfoy."Who asked you to play the hero, you filthy mudblood?"  Draco spat.Athena froze on her spot. She had enough. Honestly.She turned around quickly, leaving Harry behind.She went over to Draco, and pushed his chest with force. "Shut the fuck up already! We all had enough of you, you fucking asshole! Leave us alone!" she yelled." What the fuck did you just do?"  he hissed in a low voice, but his eyes were burning into hers." Fucking leave us alone! I mean it!"  she continued.Draco got closer to her, their faces an inch apart. " Maybe I can help you go and meet your parents. Your filthy, traitor parents,"  he venomously said.Athena looked at him, her jaw clenched. Before she could think, she punched him on his face, resulting into him taking a few steps back.Draco touched his nose, and took a look at his blood covered fingers. He raised his eyes, looking at her, furious."I will kill you, you fucking whore!"  he yelled and went to attack her, but he heard a voice calling out his name.It was the Astronomy teacher, Mr. Keaton. " Malfoy! De Kamp! You earned yourselves two weeks of detention!"  he yelled. " Two weeks!"  he repeated, fuming.They looked at him, breathing heavily. Then they looked at each other again, the hate radiating from them." This isn't over,"  Athena threatened, and started walking away.Harry and Hermione were calling out her name, but she didn't turn around.She just wanted to get away from everyone.Easily one of my favorite chapters!I love how this book is slowly growing...
