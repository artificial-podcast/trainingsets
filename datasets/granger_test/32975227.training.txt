There was a flurry of whispers among the girls in Hogwarts that has apparently brought more house unity than ever before, it baffled the boys of the school, and quite frankly, the professors as well.It all began when Slughorn had created trios for potions class, Daphne Greengrass, Hannah Abbott and Padma Patil were paired. Hannah and Padma had begun discussing Padma’s date with Michael Corner. Apparently Padma and Michael had been intimate and she was surprised to find out his private member was not exceptionally large despite his height. This is when Daphne, who had been silently eavesdropping, cut in and asked how large his feet were. Much to Hannah and Padma’s surprise, they were too stunned that the Slytherin had even talked to them to say anything back. When Daphne asked again, Padma finally found her words. “What do you mean...his feet?” Padma asked, befuddled by the question. “I mean how big are his feet, it’s a dead give away.” Daphne said, throwing crumpled bits of moonseed into their cauldron. Hannah and Padma both shared a look, neither having any clue what she was speaking of. “Uh, I don’t know, average sized, I suppose?” Padma responded, still confused. “Well there ya go. Average sized feet, average sized penis.” Daphne said nonchalantly, making Hannah snort and then clasping a hand over her mouth at the sudden noise. “And just how would you know?” Padma asked, jutting out her hip, giving the Slytherin girl a skeptical look. Daphne’s lips spread into a very slow smile, it looked cunning and flirty. “Well everyone knows,” She said, dusting her hands on her robes, “the bigger the feet the bigger the dick.” After the little encounter, the three girls spent every potions class discussing boys in seventh and eighth year who had the biggest feet. Padma of course told Parvarti, Hannah had told Susan, from there the little saying had spread around Hogwarts like wildfire. Ginny came up with the marvelous idea to create a list, marking down which boys had the biggest feet, and of course how well the theory matched the saying. Padma kept the list, seemingly making herself the secretary and organized get togethers in all the common rooms every Thursday night. Ravenclaws hosted every first Thursday, then Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and ended with Slytherins. Some nights they had nothing new to report on and instead would gossip about past ventures, or shared house secrets. The girls had single handedly  boosted morale after the war, bridging together and finding common ground through gossip and scandalous stories. It drove the boys of Hogwarts mad. They had often tried to find out what had suddenly connected the girls so deeply and kept them all hush hush and giggly around them. Some of them had even reached across their own aisles and asked if other houses had known what was going on. Theo Nott, Anthony Goldstein and Roger Malone had all mentioned how annoying the increased sounds of their snickers had become during potions class. No man had successfully intercepted any notes, or heard anything in the common rooms, despite their honest efforts. “This is fucking ridiculous. I didn’t think it was possible for girls to get more annoying.” Theo complained, slouching down on the sofa in the Slytherin common room. It became a sort of routine for the boys to meet in the common room when it was clearly the Thursday the girls met. “Anthony said McClaggen was going to pay some third year girl from Ravenclaw to eavesdrop on them today, so we’ll see how that goes.” Blaise commented, and Draco snorted. Both boys lifted their heads over to him at the noise. “What?” Theo noisily asked.“McClaggen just lost galleons and you guys are no closer to figuring out what they’re up to.” He casually said, eyes not leaving the roll of parchment for his potions assignment. “Maybe we’d be closer to figuring out what’s going on if you actually decided to help plot with us.” Theo responded, his stare narrowed in an accusatory manner. “It’s funnier to watch you all struggle and plus…I genuinely don’t care.” Draco said and stood up to head to his room, snickering to himself as he heard his friends continue to discuss the possibilities of what the girls were talking about all the time. Hermione was on the quest to learn something new. Though she doubted the actual claimed ‘fact’ was true and thought it was more hearsay, she was extremely curious to do her own research instead of base it off of others. Hermione, who of course heard of the theory early on from Ginny, laughed at the notion. Anatomy and biology don’t work like that, there was no proof to even back up such a claim. But seeing all the girls giggle and talk to each other in classes made her feel left out, so she decided to join in on the discussions and offered to protect their meetings with her extensive knowledge of silencing charms and wards. She tagged along to the get togethers, for research of course. The compressive list Padma had drawn up was actually quite impressive and had very few outliers. According to the witches and their experiences, most of the upper year level boys had actually proven the theory. The average foot size for men was 27.9 centimeters, a size ten. The average penis size was 12.95 to 13.97  centimeters. The boys who had average sized penises more often than not were a size ten shoe, that included, Michael Corner, Neville Longbottom, Roger Malone, Justin Finch-Fletchley and Ernie Macmillan. They decided that anyone with a foot size of 11.5 or larger, would mean they most likely had an above average penis which was anything above 16 centimeters. Those above average boys included Blaise Zabini, Anthony Goldstein, Dean Thomas and Zacharias Smith. Hermione had objections, like how did they know the exact size of the member, how did they find out the size of their shoes and how can the girls who had been intimate with those boys remember correctly the details. She brought up valid points and now the new task of the get togethers was to plot how to verify their findings. They also created a list  of anomalies that included boys whose members were thick but not necessarily large, or, long but not thick and how that would play into their foot size. Despite the actual disgusting talk of male genitals, it was a lot of fun, and the first semester was passing quickly because of the girls’ dedication to find out the truth. They had successfully confirmed the sizes of shoes of almost every seventh and eighth year, except one: Draco Malfoy. The Slytherin had been a recluse the entire year, only speaking to Nott and Zabini, only ever seen in the common room or library outside of classes, he never even went to Hogsmeade on the weekends. He was dutiful to his work, possibly the only thing he did was study, it was the hardest anyone had ever seen him work in school. Hermione had noticed how quiet he’d become almost immediately. He’d only speak in classes when spoken to by the Professors, his voice seemed oddly lower since last year. Maybe she’d just imagined it or it was from his lack of speaking that caused his voice to ricochet through the walls of the classrooms.Draco Malfoy had strangely also been the only person where no girl had heard a reliable story to share. Daphne had assured the group that no one  had ever gotten involved with him, including Pansy. No girl at Hogwarts had so much as shared a kiss with him, he was an enigma and Hermione felt intrigued.At the last meeting Daphne and Ginny had challenged the girls to get creative with proving the theory correct. They had suggested that the boys who had not had any known sexual history be seduced by one of the girls in the group. Essentially the boys who they had to guess at the size of their lengths only going off shoe size were the targets. The people that remained were Theodore Nott, Terry Boot, Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy. They had the week to decide who would volunteer as a participant in the research. Which led to right now, as the group of girls currently sat in the Gryffindor common room, all laughing about a gone wrong transfiguration class today involving Seamus, of course, and a rather grim attempt at transfiguring a desk into a bar of soap. His successful transfigurations lasted a second until the bar of soap exploded and bubbled filled the room like a bathtub. Once the laughter had settled Daphne stood up and tried to grab everyone’s attention.“Okay okay! Let’s get down to business. Has everyone had time to think about the cause?” Everyone roared with laughter at Daphne referring to their little research project as the cause. “Will we get a bloody medal if we join the cause?” Susan joked from the corner of the room, making more laughter erupt from the girls. “Oooh! That’s actually not a bad idea, Bones. Shall we make the cause more worthwhile?” Daphne waggled her eyebrows suggestively. “Monetary rewards?” Ginny suggested.Some of the girls agreed, others moaned with disapproval. “Instead of rewards why don’t we do punishments?” Parvati gleefully added. The crowd oo’ed. “Smart girl Parv. So punishments? Will that deter any of the girls who wanted to volunteer today?” Daphne asked. “Can we discuss what the punishments will be first? Nothing overly embarrassing.” Sophie Roper asked, politely raising a hand. “Ladies? Any suggestions?” Daphne opened the floor for discussion. “A naked dive in the Black Lake?” One girl suggested.“Sneak into the boy’s dorms and collect their underwear?” Lisa spoke.“String it up in the Great Hall!” Hannah added with a giggle.“Kiss a sixth year in the Great Hall!” The girls had laughed and cheered anytime someone came up with a good idea. Some were so ridiculous and hilarious, everyone nearly had tears in their eyes as they continued on their brainstorm. “Pants one of the boys on the list!” “Eat a whole box of Every Flavor Beans?” “Wait!” Ginny hollered, making every girl in the room fall silent, all eyes were on the redhead as she slowly stood up, a devilish smile taking over her face. “If the volunteers fail to properly seduce their assigned boy and get the information we need, then they must flash them their top half goodies!” They all jeered and some of the girls clapped five with Ginny. It seems they all agreed on the suggested punishment. It wasn’t too terribly bad and Hermione even thought it would be truly funny to see the look on the boy’s face, whoever it ended up being. “Perfect. Now that we have the punishment, we need four brave souls to give their bodies and brains to the cause. Who will be the first one to step up?” Daphne asked, Padma was ready with a quill and parchment to write down the name. Hermione raised her hand almost immediately, earning her own roars of cheers and whistles.“Bloody Gryffindors I should have known you’d be first.” Daphne jousted. “What can I say? You’ve presented an interesting theory. I need more proof than just some of everyone’s words so I’m going out into the field to find out the truth for myself.” Her little speech earned a round of applause from the room and she laughed at the ridiculousness of it all. “Have to say I’m slightly shocked, rumors are that you’re either a prude or Ronald Weasley’s girlfriend.” Daphne said with raised eyebrows. Hermione crossed her arms and smiled with her chin jutted out. “While I’m neither and belong only to myself.” Another round of applause for the golden Gryffindor. “Well is there anyone in particular you’re hoping to get?” Padma asked, as she threw her name written on the parchment into the enchanted hat. “Mm, I think Theo’s cute, so is Zabini honestly.” She admitted and took her seat again, next to Hannah. “Ooo, Granger’s got a thing for snakes! Well good luck to you and may you be as skilled in seduction as you are in everything else in the world. Okay who’s next?” “Me! Always up for a challenge involving a cute boy.” Parvati grinned. Lisa Turpin volunteered and then there was only one more needed for their cause. Everyone looked around, patiently waiting, but no one else rose and it suddenly dawned on the group that maybe their mission would fail. “No one? Come on ladies.” After another moment of silence Daphne rolled her eyes. “Fine you bloody prudes, add my name Padma.” The girls laughed and once Padma had added the final name to the hat, they all leaned in closer, patiently waiting for it to magically spit out the pairings. They watched as the hat began to glow and a parchment flew out, Padma grabbed it. “Parv and Boot.” The girls clapped and Parvati flipped her hair off her shoulder. “I’ll have him eating out the palm of my hands before New Years.” Everyone laughed and watched as the hat spit out another piece of parchment. Daphne grabbed this one. “Lisa and Nott, have fun with that one love.” She winked and Lisa actually blushed while Ginny nudged her with a hoot. The next note came out and Hermione began to bite the skin around her thumbnail. She suddenly became extremely nervous, knowing her chances for pairing with a certain Slytherin were now increasing. She didn’t think she’d actually get matched with him, and her interest lied more with others that she could probably pull something off, not with an impossible task. The room went dead silent as the hat puffed out the parchment, all eyes casted on the falling piece of paper. Padma’s hand reached for it and her mouth opened, eyes widened and she didn’t speak for a moment. Hermione felt her stomach wind up with anxiety. Oh no. “Zabini and Daph.” Padama said, eyes wide at the group. “Which means—“ “Malfoy and Granger.” Daphne tensely said, her lips twitching to the side.There was a small cluster of gasps as Hermione felt her chest roll. Everyone waited to see her reaction, even Daphne fell quiet, unsure of what to say. Hermione took a breath and rolled her shoulders back, projecting the fakest and reassuring smile ever, concealing her disappointment. “Well…looks like I’ll be flashing Malfoy my tits.” She spoke and the room was deadly silent, until Ginny muffled a laugh that sounded like she was choking and then everyone cackled up a storm. She felt her muscles loosen a bit, and the girls began offering their own pieces of advice. “Flash him before Christmas leave, so you won’t have to see him.” Hannah suggested. “If one of us fails with our boys you could always give it a try?” Parvati stated, but the idea seemed gross. “Sooner you do it, the sooner we can find a new partner.” Daphne said, and Hermione offered her a thin smile but her mood felt ruined. She was determined to make the most of her research, live out the eighth year to the fullest especially after the war. There was nothing that she wouldn’t do this year, within reason, determined to make up for the years she was too busy trying to save the world, she promised herself to never let an opportunity go awry. Right now it felt like one of the best ones just slipped through her fingers. No. This wouldn’t be the end of the road. Odds were against her, hell, she was against herself, but her mind was made up and the wheels were turning in her brain. Hermione wouldn’t let her pairing deter her from her desired success. She’d try for the remainder of the semester to seduce Malfoy, for the sake of the cause. She owed it to the girls and to herself, the research would have to be extensive and complete in order for it to be correct. She would have to be tactical, cunning and careful, she was dealing with a Slytherin after all. But even as she sat and helped organize planned attacks for how to get the boys attention without giving up their reasonings, Hermione felt her hope dwindle. All the other girls’ tasks felt tangible, and Malfoy felt like an unclimbable mountain. As if it weren’t enough that he didn’t speak to anyone other than Zabini and Nott this year, Hermione had noticed he would stay as far away from her as possible, or so it seemed. At first it just felt like a coincidence, he would get up and move seats in class if she was as much as one desk in front or beside him, so she assumed he wanted to be closer to friends in class. But then it continued happening in every class they shared and Malfoy went as far as to sit next to Neville one day to avoid sitting one desk away from her. It didn’t feel coincidental anymore. There was also an extraordinarily odd occasion where they would be in the library at the same time. He would rarely be there unless he needed to check out books, but as she would find herself behind him, waiting patiently to check out her own books, he’d turn around, see her and narrow his eyes before walking away impossibly fast.Hermione wasn’t sure if that was just Malfoy, so she tried to pay attention to the way he’d react with other people but no one seemed to bother him or emit any negative reactions. He seemed totally unperturbed by everyone else in Hogwarts except her and she couldn’t figure out why, it was maddening. But there were times, on the rare occasion, if she were focusing long enough on her notes in class, she could feel the back of her neck tingle, and her spine straighten, as if someone was watching her. She’d turn her head around the room and always find his pair of gray eyes. They would hold each other’s stare, Hermione challenging him to look away first but he never did, she always caved. His stare never had any malice or snarky emotions behind them, he sometimes looked…thoughtful, or intrigued maybe.She didn’t harbour any negative feelings towards Malfoy about his part in the war, she could rationalize his decisions and think they were plausible, but apparently he still had some underlying emotions towards her that didn’t feel like they were necessarily positive. He didn’t dislike her, but he also didn’t like her, but she had a hard time believing it was still because she was a muggle-born. She’d find out what his issue was, and then, she’d seduce him. “Ladies.” Hermione called, interrupting the chatter about Megan’s plans with Boot. Attention was focused on her and she felt something powerful move within herself. “I’m still going to try to finish this with Malfoy.” Some of the girls let out tiny, disbelieving gasps, others found themselves smiling with their mouths open at her audacity. Hermione looked around and eyes landed on Daphne, who was grinning like a cat. “But I’ll need all of your help.” Hermione said, deadly serious. “Just tell us what to do and we’ll make it happen.” Ginny assured and all the girls eagerly nodded. Hermione’s mood surged exponentially and she felt like the girls were about to accomplish monumental. “It’ll have to start in classes. I need to sit by him in every class if possible.” “You’ll have to start slower than that, Draco will know you’re up to something if you suddenly go out of your way to sit next to him.” Daphne cautioned and Hermione nodded. “Good point. So I’ll start tomorrow in charms, he usually sits by Nott so maybe Lisa you can distract Theo before class and can everyone else try their hardest so the only possible seat is next to me?” Hermione asked and everyone nodded. “Is there any information we should know about the boys to make this a little easier?” Lisa asked, bringing up a very valid point. “Terry loves rock and roll music.” Hannah said. “Theo is extremely responsive to sarcastic flirting.” Daphne expressed. “I overheard Zabini tell Anthony he thinks girls who wear big oversized sweaters and high ponytails are incredibly cute.” Padma added. Lisa, Parvati and Daphne all nodded, mentally taking in the notes and adding it to their arsenal to use for later. Hermione looked at Daphne, desperation on her face. “Daphne, is there anything that would be helpful to know about Malfoy? Literally any piece of information?” Daphne looked unsure, trying to rack her brain for something useful for the golden girl. She tilted her head, a memory coming to her mind and it was absolutely perfect for Hermione. “In third year, he’d carry around this book like his life depended on it, he’s re-read it every year since. A tattered old thing but suffice to say it’s his favorite book and you can get it in the library. Get it, maybe he’ll bite if he sees you reading it.” Daphne explained and Hermione felt like she was just given a key to a very dark and dreary castle. “Perfect, what’s the name of the book?” “’Samuel Sandus and the Guileful Gimlet.’” Daphne said and Hermione frowned. “Isn’t that…a fiction book?” Hermione questioned, wondering why Malfoy would read something like that, but didn't seem his style. “Yep, almost a children’s adventure story. But, for some reason it’s his favorite. Faithfully brings it to school like a baby blanket.” “Interesting. Well I have no complaints I just hope it’ll pique his fascination enough to not be so cold to me.” Hermione replied, not believing she was pinning her plan on a class seating arrangement and a book. “It will, so any more questions?” Daphne finally asked and everyone in the room shook their heads no. “Alright, we begin tomorrow then.” “Tomorrow.” The girls said at once and the sensation of excitement and doughtiness rose within all of them.

With a free period, Lisa and Hermione decided to plan for Charms class in the Great Hall. Luckily they were both observant enough to know where their targeted boys were coming from before their class together.“If we catch them earlier in the hallways I think it would be better.” Hermione commented and Lisa eagerly nodded.“Usually they’re always together though. It makes this a little more…intimidating.” Lisa chimed, wariness all over her face.“Well, I could try and distract Malfoy? I don’t know how though.” Hermione said, her brown low on her forehead.“Did you get that book Daphne mentioned?” Lisa asked hopefully and Hermione pulled it from her bag to show her.“Yes. I was planning on having it out during class so he could see I was reading, then gauge his reaction and maybe make conversation? I don’t know.” Hermione sighed and rolled her lips into her mouth. “It’s not a good plan, but I don’t know what else to do.”Lisa took a deep inhale and looked around the Great Hall, as if the answer were going to be dropped by an incoming owl. Her eyes widened and she wore a hopeful expression.“What about, I don’t know? Dropping your books in front of him? He’ll help you pick it up and maybe that’s how you can start a conversation.” Lisa suggested and Hermione shook her head.“I don’t think he’d help me pick up my books. Let's just focus on Theo. That’ll be easier.” Hermione said slightly defeated and then the girls both rose from the benches, making their way to charms class. The girls walked side by side, winking at some of the girls who knew what they were up to and quietly giggling along the way.“Oh there he is!” Lisa whispered and somehow also yelled. Hermione shushed her and lightly laughed as she stared at the back of Theo’s sandy hair. Paired with him was of course Malfoy, both boys rather tall in height, Theo maybe one inch taller but definitely lankier.“Okay, remember confidence is key. Just ask him about the upcoming Charms essay or something.” Hermione said reassuringly and Lisa nodded, a little too much, but she took a breath to calm her nerves.“Go.” Hermione nudged and Lisa began walking faster. She caught up with Theo and lightly touched his shoulder, making the scruffy Slytherin stop his walk as well as his companion. Lisa flashed a flirty smile but still blushed rather hard when Theo turned his attention to her. Hermione slowed her pace to watch more of the interaction and smile when she saw Theo wave off Malfoy. The blonde Slytherin hesitated and then scowled at his friend before turning and walking away.Hermione happily watched, unaware of her surroundings, as she walked past Theo and Lisa, engaging in what appeared to be a smooth conversation. She caught Lisa’s eye and raised her brows in an amused way, causing Lisa to smirk back.Just as she turned her head back to focus on her path, she stepped on the back of someone’s heel, tripping them and following them face down on the ground seconds after. Her books scattered, parchment rolled and she sat on her knees, hurrying out apologies as she grabbed her items.“Oh my gosh! I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to clip you, I was distracted.” Hermione rushed out, cheeks flaming with warmth as she grabbed her copy of Samuel Sandus and the Guileful Gimlet as well as her other belongings.“It’s fine.” A voice mumbled and her movements were momentarily forgotten.She pushed back some of her hair off her face and saw Malfoy in front of her. His eyes were centered on gathering his own items, pushing anything that didn’t belong to him over to her without ever handing her anything. Hermione watched as he scrambled, wondering why he still refused to meet her eye. She decided to push a bit, see what she could get out of him.“What? No: ‘You’re as clumsy as you are stupid Granger?’” Hermione asked, confused by his silence. Draco stood before her, looking down at her with the first smirk she’s seen from him all year and casting a shadow over her with his staggering height.“You’re as clumsy as you are stupid Granger.” He said and Hermione tilted her head to the side, trying to understand his angle. No bite, no claws or scowls. It didn’t make sense but she’d guess he didn’t seem to make a lot of sense this year.He began to turn away from her but she hurriedly gripped his pant leg as she noticed a small, dark red cut on his chin.“Malfoy, wait.” She said, her hand pulling the material and his silver eyes flickered down to her hold then back to meet her stare.There has never been a time where Hermione willingly touched Malfoy, and brushing against his clothed skin felt foreign. She swallowed once, sensing the familiar agitation in his stare and let her hand drop from his pant leg. She looked down quickly, collecting the remaining scattered items in her arms. Her eyes traveled down his leg and she attempted to get a sense at his shoe size.Her eyes widened and she coughed in shock.His feet were massive, easily the biggest pair of shoes she’s seen besides Hagrid’s. They looked to be nearly double the size of her own feet, and she didn’t even think she had that small of feet!“I don’t have all day.” She heard his drawl from above her and tentatively rose to her full height, stuttering a bit as she blinked up at him.“Erm, your chin. It’s cut, from the fall I assume.” She pointed to the skin that seemed to have already dried. Draco raised his fingers and touched the area with his fingers, before wiping it off totally.“It’s just blood, Granger.” He said bored, but his eyebrows shot up as if to ask her for an argument, then he turned to walk away from her. She felt herself falter a bit at the words, nearly laughing at the irony. Instead, she pushed out a breath from her nose and licked the top of her lip quickly.“Guess so.” She mumbled at the strange interaction but felt herself giddy at the new information she could share with the girls this week.The odd moment with Malfoy had caused her to jog to class, being one of the last people to enter. She saw him stutter in steps at the front of the room, seeing Lisa and Theo still animatedly chatting next to each other. Unassigned seating was a regular thing, but everyone had basically solidified their spots weeks ago. Any changes to the nonexistent seating chart rocked the proverbial boat.“Come now Mr. Malfoy and Ms. Granger. Please take a seat.” Professor Flitwick waved the two in and Hermione could see Malfoy straighten his back as he walked to the lone pair of desks. There were some quiet whispers among the class, a small snicker from Daphne in the back and a quirked brow from Blaise beside her.Malfoy was shooting daggers at Theo who sat behind the desk and merely shrugged. Lisa sent Hermione a private and knowing smile as she padded down the aisle and took her seat next to Malfoy. She was hyper aware of everything she was doing; her breathing, the way she placed her bag down and brought out her book and notes, all done with precision attentiveness.She was hardly paying attention to Professor Flitwick, too immersed in thinking of her next way to talk with Malfoy that didn’t involve tripping him to the ground. Casually looking to her right, she tried to mindlessly take in Malfoy’s side features while appearing to be looking around the classroom.He was decently attractive. His features had filled out a bit, his head less obnoxious and face less aggressive. It seemed his shoulders were now less hunched and narrow, perhaps after the war he finally began to find an appetite again. His lips were slightly parted as he blew out long even breaths, lips a light shade of pink that reminded her of sweet taffy.“Alright now. Turn to a nearby table and work on the discussion questions I’ve provided on the board regarding non verbals spells. Each response must be one hundred words. Whatever you don’t finish will be homework due for next class.” Professor Flitwick announced and Hermione felt Lisa tap her on the shoulder. She turned to face her and Malfoy did the same, throwing his paper on Theo’s desk. Theo scowled and shoved his things away, earning a glare from Malfoy.Draco’s tall stature forced him to have one knee outstretched in the aisle and one leg overcrowding Hermione’s space. She tightly had her thighs pressed together, not sure if she wanted to cross the invisible line between them and open her legs to a comfortable position, but he was hogging all the room between them.“Okay, question number one is easy enough, I can handle that one.” Lisa offered and began writing down the answer. Hermione glanced up at Theo who began to lean over the desk onto Lisa’s side of the table.“Mind if I check it when you’re done Turpin?” He asked, earning a grin from Lisa.“Why? Don’t trust my knowledge Nott? I can assure you my answer will be better than what you would have put.” Lisa shot back with ease, a small smirk on her lips and Hermione was momentarily impressed by how well she flirted.“When it comes to grades I just want to make sure I get the best.” Theo said with a grin and Malfoy rolled his eyes at his lame friend.“I am the best Nott.” Lisa responded and both were lost in their own worlds. Hermione gaped at the two, mouth parted in heavy amounts of amusement.“Bleeding hell.” Malfoy mumbled and grabbed the paper from Lisa’s hands without even her noticing. Theo and Lisa were too absorbed in their own conversation to really pay any attention to Malfoy and Hermione, both of them turned back around in their desks. Maybe this way they’d actually be able to finish the questions before class ended.“I’ll work on number three.” Hermione told him, reaching for her own paper and barely noticed the nod of his head as a response.She read the question once more before hunching over the desk and scribbling furiously, completely unaware that her posture changed and her leg was only millimeters away from Malfoy’s knees. He was too busy writing the answer to the next question on a separate piece of paper to notice how close they were. Hermione’s leg widened, cramping from the small space she was allotted and just barely brushed Malfoy’s thigh with her kneecap.His body tensed, as did hers, but he was noticeably stiff. She didn’t immediately remove her leg, instead she embraced the warmth of his body and let her knee rest there until he inevitably moved away. She counted in her head, one, two, three, four, five, six seconds until she felt him slightly twitch his away. It wasn’t that far away from her touch, she could maybe extend her leg out wider and feel him again.She waited a minute before pretending to readjust in her seat and spread her legs open wider, her knee nuzzled against his thigh once more. Her heartbeat was heavy in her ears.“Did you want number four?” Hermione asked innocently, her eyes looking at his side profile. He glanced sideways at her for a second, still scribbling his answer and flashed to where their legs were touching. She saw his jaw clench and brow come together on his forehead.“You can take it. I’ll handle five.” Draco grumbled and Theo turned his head to them.“Need any help?” Theo asked, creeping up from his desk.“No.” Draco snapped immediately, head not turning back.“Erm, not really.” Hermione echoed and sent Lisa a reassuring smile over her shoulder. They continued their small conversation and Hermione was proud at least one of the girl’s plans was working.Draco didn’t move away this time. He let his leg rest against hers and Hermione found herself rereading her sentences over and over again, getting lost in the thin fabric between them, cheeks blushing at the shared warmth.After a few minutes of silence and trying to piece together an accurate response to the assigned question, Hermione felt Malfoy nudge her with his leg. She hesitantly looked over at him, his expression bored and waiting.“Having trouble?” He drawled and eyed the one sentence she wrote for her question. Looking down at her parchment, she frowned and took a deep breath. Straightening her back, her leg reluctantly moved away from his and she felt the fog clear.“Um, no. Just a little confused at first.” She mumbled, feeling her cheeks heat up as she felt him stare at her.“It’s pretty straightforward. What are you confused by?” Malfoy pressed, his tone slightly edgy. Hermione kept her eyes on the paper, blinking slowly before rolling her eyes to meet his stare.“If I should answer it straightforwardly or provide extra explanations?” Hermione tried to cover the fact that she hadn’t been paying attention at all and she hoped he didn’t notice. Malfoy kinked his brow, his lips tugging upwards just the smallest amount.“I think being straightforward would suffice, Granger.” Malfoy stated and returned his attention back to his question. Hermione stared a moment, trying to decide if there was some double meaning behind his sentence.Just as she was finishing off the final parts of her discussion response, she felt his leg knock into hers, but now his entire thigh was pressed against her own. Her quill scratched, an ink blot formed on the paper and Hermione felt her heart skip a beat. She looked down at his wide leg and felt her blush resurface. He felt so warm, totally opposite of his cold and chilly personality.“Actually um.” She said out loud, having no idea where she was going with her words. Malfoy looked back to her, his stare showing signs of amusement as she struggled to find words.“I—“ Hermione swallowed when he leaned back into his chair, widening his legs and casually resting his hands on top of his thighs. His laid back demeanor was way too casual for him but something about it almost made her navel flutter in a most pleasant way.“If you need something Granger, you need only ask.” He spoke with his lips curling up.Hermione felt her eyebrows turn down for a second, wondering why his voice sounded so bloody appealing when he spoke octaves below what was considered normal. She licked her lips and swore his eyes flickered down to the action, she felt curious by him.The bell tolled, singling the end of class just as Hermione opened her mouth to most likely utter some nonsense. Draco smirked and rose from his seat, leaving Hermione’s leg cool to the point of shivering.“Over already? Thank Merlin.” Theo commented, collecting his items. “Finish the questions?”Hermione looked up as she came out of the fog and wrote everyone’s names in the upper corner. “Uh, yeah.”“No thanks to you.” Malfoy murmured over his shoulder.“We owe you two. We can cover your next assignment, right Theo?” Lisa nudged him, holding her books to her chest.“Right. We’ll cover an assignment for the smartest people in class.” He dryly responded, earning a sneer from Malfoy.“Not necessary, though it’s a nice gesture Lisa.” She said thankfully and heard Malfoy scoff behind her and proceed to walk out of the classroom. Lisa nodded her head in Malfoy’s direction, signaling to Hermione that she thinks she should follow him.She frowned and shook her head but Lisa nodded again with more urgency. Hermione rolled her eyes and turned on her heel once Theo turned to Lisa with a smile and asked if she wanted his company walking to their next class.Walking down the halls, she tried to remember if Malfoy had a free period or class. Catching sight of his blonde hair, her steps increased and she began to weave in and out of the students. He took a turn into the courtyard and she almost left, not realizing she was about to approach with nothing to talk about.Malfoy sat behind one of the trees and pulled out a book from his rucksack. Hermione just caught him most likely casting a warming charm as he paged through his book rather quickly. He grunted and huffed, then threw his book back in his bag and stood. Hermione reached him as he turned around, his face easing into a neutral expression as his eyes took her in.“Come to give me my book back?” Malfoy said while crossing his arms. Hermione stopped a few feet away, having no idea what he was referring to.“Your book? What do you mean?” Hermione asked and Malfoy rolled his eyes then dug back into his bag. Hermione waited until he revealed his copy of Samuel Sandus and waved it in the air.“This isn’t mine. You must’ve swiped mine while collecting your items from the ground after you tried to kill me.” He raised a brow and took a step forward, she narrowed her eyes at him.“I wasn’t trying to kill you. And even if I was, I would have been a little more creative and discrete.” She crossed her arms and jutted out her hip, Draco looked at the action and grinned just a bit.“I don’t doubt that the day you attempt to kill me won’t be a most fun experience for the both of us. But I want my book back.” He said taking another step to her, close enough that he reached down for her bag but she slapped his hand away and tightened her grip around her bag.“Don’t touch my things.” She warned and Malfoy raised a brow.“Technically I want to touch something that belongs to me.” He retaliated while reaching for her bag again but missed and grabbed her wrist instead.Hermione’s eyes rounded at the contact and she was shocked to find his hand easily wrapped around her arm. His palm felt warm and soft, she didn’t really mind the contact, it felt sort of nice.  Her breath faltered for a moment and she looked back up at him with a trying sneer.“I’m more than capable of fetching your book from my bag.”“Just be quicker for me to grab it.” He smirked.She tried to slip her hand out of his grip but he kept it firmly in place. Draco eyes flipped down to her lips and quickly back up to her face, causing a flash of heat to fill her cheeks. His other hand went back inside her back and Hermione reached with her other hand to stop him.Draco’s face seemed cheery that she suddenly grabbed his hand and then they both looked down at their bodies, realizing their oddly close and bizarre stance. Hermione’s eyes traveled downwards and she slid her hand inside the bag, brushing against his fingers as she rummaged to find the book. Peaking a glance up at Malfoy, he raised a brow which made her embarrassingly look away.His hand stayed on her wrist while the other helped her find the book. They both pulled the book out of the bag slowly, Hermione awkwardly dropping her arm away when she began to stare a little too long at him. Draco dropped her other arm and she took a step away, clearing her throat.He handed her the copy she received in the library and she took it with a quiet ‘thanks.’“You could have come up with something more clever than stealing my book Granger.” Draco commented and Hermione gave him a questionable look as she tucked away her book.“Now what are you talking about?” She asked, chewing on the inside of her cheek.“Like I said earlier, if you want something from me, all you need to do is ask.” Malfoy slowly stated then hit her shoulder lightly as he walked away.Hermione stood still for a moment, pondering what he could mean by his odd statement. For a stuttering moment she thought his words felt…sexual. Like Malfoy may have known…no, absolutely not. There was no way he would have any insight to the group meetings. Hermione put up to the wards in the common room and was most confident in her abilities. She was just overthinking his behavior._Thursday in the Hufflepuff common room, the girls were eager to share how successful their weeks and weekends were. It seemed Lisa, Daphne and Parvarti all had something juicy to disclose.Hermione felt excited by the news to share, her two interactions from Malfoy last week plus the few longing stares they exchanged felt like something in the right direction. Whatever happened between them after charms in the courtyard had carried over into the next week. Extended stares that appeared to hold curiosity between the two of them. Sometimes Malfoy would catch her stare and look as if he were waiting for something. Whatever it was, Hermione found it enticing and was eager to discuss possibilities.“Theo and I are going to Hogsmeade this weekend.” Lisa told the group and some of the girls worried she had developed a little crush.“Is this a date?” Ginny inquired.“I guess so. He’s very cute and we’ve spent the last two nights working on homework in the library together.” She explained, tilting her head in thought.“Theo doesn’t usually seem like the type to date so just be careful and don’t get your hopes up too high.” Daphne chimed in, giving exceptionally thoughtful advice to her. “His dick size is still the most important factor. After that you can pursue him.”“Right, I know.” Lisa said with a determined look on her face.“How’s Boot, Parv?” Hermione asked and Parvati’s eyes widened and she remained silent. All the girls giggled and kept asking her ‘what?’ until she finally bursted.“He’s a virgin!” She shrieked and clamped a hand over her mouth. Some people gasped while others laughed.“How do you know?” Padma responded.“We were making out last night—““Sweet Merlin’s balls, Parv. You move fast, I might need some advice.” Lisa said with a laugh.“Needed to. But anyways, we were making out and I tried to reach for his…you know… and he pulled away and asked if we could take it slower because he hadn’t  done anything with a girl yet.”“Aw, that’s sweet.” Astoria, Daphne’s younger sister said.“He seemed really into it though so who knows; come the end of the month I could have taken Terry Boot’s virginity.” Parvati said with a cocky smirk.“Wonderful news Parv.” Daphne said as she gave a few slow and steady claps. Parv responded by flipping her long, dark hair over her shoulder. “As for me. I think Blaise is a little caught off guard with my sudden interest but he seemed to latch onto my flirting. He even began flirtatiously touching me more and I caught him staring down my shirt at lunch on Tuesday.”“Hard not to if I’m being honest.” Ginny chuckled. “Your boobs have their own gravitational pull.”The room burst into laughter and Daphne grabbed her breasts and began to move them in her palms.“You mean these little guys?” Daphne said, wiggling her eyebrows in an obnoxious way. The girls continued their jokes, some cackling so hard they fell out of their seats.“Okay, okay! We have to hear from Granger. Come on, hush up.” She sighed, her stomach aching from laughter. Hermione took a few more moments to calm down and then cleared her throat.“I did, quite literally, stumble upon some new information.” She said with a smirk and some ‘oo’s’ went around the room.“Well get on with it.” Ginny said, on the edge of the plush chair next to the fire.“Ladies, his feet…the biggest, I’ve ever seen. I mean they were this big.” She held her hands apart to show the girls, the crowd raised their eyebrows and murmured their disbelief.“I’ll try to catch a glimpse later this evening to confirm.” Daphne added and Hermione sent her a thankful nod.“But that’s not all.” Hermione said and the room was silent, begging for her to continue to reveal information about the recluse Slytherin. “In charms, while Lisa flirted with Theo, we worked on the class assignment. I stretched out my legs and rested my knee on his and he let me. Then ten minutes later…he rested his whole thigh against mine! It was…sort of hot.”Hermione was so excited to disclose the information she didn’t realize how mediocre it sounded compared to the other girls, but it was Malfoy after all so she hoped they understood the difficult task.“Well…that’s something.” Padma said hopefully.“Progress is progress. Anything else happen?” Daphne asked.“I was planning on staying back from Hogsmeade this weekend, see if I could catch him in the library. We briefly talked about the book in the courtyard last week as well so I was thinking I could chat him up about it.” Hermione told the group and her eyes met Daphne’s.“He usually goes after lunch I think. You could probably catch him in the Great Hall beforehand.” She suggested and Hermione nodded.“I’ll try then. Maybe engage in a conversation where I don’t tackle him to the ground.” Hermione said.“I know Daphne knows him the best, but Malfoy is still a guy and it’s not exactly like Hermione is ugly.” Ginny said and Hermione gave her a funny look.“Thanks Gin?” She said with a laugh.“What I mean is that maybe you should see how he responds to flirting, maybe more touching? Wear something to catch his eye?” She offered, looking at Daphne to agree.“Weasley is right. I’m honestly surprised he even did the whole thigh touching thing. So maybe try and wear something a little more…revealing in the library. See if he takes a peak.” Daphne agreed.Hermione frowned, thinking there was nothing in her wardrobe that was considered ‘revealing’ and also appropriate for the library.“Alright. I suppose I’ll try then.” Hermione stated, unsure if it was actually going to work.“We’ll help. Honestly Mione, we aren’t too worried if this doesn’t work. Focus on Malfoy for however long you want and then we can move on once you decide it’s not worth it.” Ginny said reassuringly.Hermione tightly smiled and agreed, but she wouldn’t let their doubts disturb her plans. Malfoy was responsive and she thought back to last week when his eyes paid attention to her lips, when his soft hand brushed with hers in her bag and the way his body felt in charms class. The door was cracked open and she wasn’t going to stop until she busted it down. Draco was going to be surprised come Saturday, he could count on it.

“I don’t know. This seems…more muggle fashion than anything. Are you sure?” Hermione asked as she looked in the mirror. Daphne and Ginny both sat on her bed and nodded eagerly. They dressed her in something that was considered to be conservatively cute and did her hair to make it not resemble a bush.“You look cute!” Ginny clapped her hands together and stood up to retrieve her own coat. “Plus your legs are some of your best assets, he’ll definitely notice.”“She’s right, Granger. The skirt and the socks show just enough for a little tease.” Daphne added, admiring her from the bed.Hermione looked at them and then worriedly turned back to the mirror. The gray, pleated skirt was a little higher on her hips, revealing her upper thighs but luckily not causing issues for her when she sat down. Daphne loaned her a pair of lacy black knee socks and a tight black longsleeve to show a  little more of her figure. She truly didn’t look bad, but Hermione didn’t think she’d wear something like this. Rationalizing that the occasion called for it, she just hoped it would catch the desired eye.“We should be going as should you. Like I said, you could maybe catch him in the Great Hall, but just head to the library first, get cozied up and relax.” Daphne told her with a smirk, knowing the little lion was extremely nervous to seek out the snake.“Right. And…remind me again what I should do when I get there?.” Hermione asked, rubbing her hands over the skirt to flatten the invisible wrinkles.“You both are annoyingly smart, I’m sure something will come up. Talk about that book he likes.” Ginny explained and Hermione felt herself swallow and nod. There wasn’t any real reason to be nervous. She wasn’t intimidated by Malfoy and he certainly hasn’t been rude to her this year.Maybe it was because Hermione began to notice him since their little touch and go session in Charms. She noticed he’d lick his lips frequently in potions class when he was focusing. She noticed his fingers were exceptionally long and slender, his veins looked like vines wrapped around tree trunks on his hand with a sparkling silver class ring on his middle finger. She realized he had a silver necklace, as well, tucked into his robes, her eyes only ever catching sight of it every so often. He did well to hide what it was.All his little habits began to make her squirm. Her task was of course to engage in sexual relations with him and prior to the commitment, she never thought about Malfoy like that. Now it was all she thought of. Her throat would dry up and her cheeks would catch on fire in those small moments where she felt his silver eyes.“Are you sure you don’t need anything from town?” Ginny asked, throwing on her scarf.“No, I'm okay. I’ll let you know how today goes though.” She responded and the girls walked out of Hermione’s room and down through the hallways. They both wished her good luck before heading off in their respective directions.Hermione sighed once and gripped her bag a little tighter. It was a sort of dreary Saturday, overcast with chilly winds. She was actually happy to skip Hogsmeade and trade it for a nice quiet time in the library. It was relatively empty once she arrived, and after she did a small sweep to see if Malfoy was there, she settled near a corner where she could view the entrance.As she worked on an essay for Arithmancy, Hermione became lost in her own world, too focused on her research to notice the Slytherin entering the library.Draco paused as he passed through the doors, his eyes halting over the girl sitting in a place where she doesn’t typically reside. Her go to library desk was diagonal across the room, perched between towers of books and far away from tables of students. Why was she sitting so close to the door today? More importantly, why was she even here today? Wearing that? There was nothing typical about her today and the thought made Draco’s lips tug in a knowing smirk. He assumed she’d seek him out soon enough, he just wanted to see how long it would take her.He walked in the opposite direction and headed to the row that contained the information he needed for his Arithmancy essay.Hermione got up from her table and headed to the section that held books in ancient Hebrew script, needing to reference something for her essay. She piled two books in her arms and wove two aisles down, smiling as she saw the book on two shelves above her head and stood on her toes to summon it. As she extended her hand, the book flew over her head, nearly clipping her ears, and into the hands of someone to her left. She turned her head to glare at the person who clearly just stole it from her but her mouth parted when she was met with a triumphant pair of silver eyes.“I need that.” Hermione said immediately, blinking at the book then back to him. Nothing better came to mind, and in hindsight, her word choice was a poor way to start a conversation.“As do I, but I got to it first.” Malfoy replied casually, flipping the book open to it’s index.“Actually I was here first, you just happened to summon it before I did.” She corrected. “Therefore I think it correctly belongs to me.”Malfoy snorted, half of his mouth contorting into a smile. Something in her stomach twisted.“Your logic is flawed. If you really wanted it, maybe you should have summoned it faster. But you didn’t, therefore, it’s mine.” He said and turned on his heel, leaving her alone in the stacks but he knew she would follow.“Do you need it right this moment?” Hermione asked hot on his heels.“Does it matter?” Malfoy asked over his shoulder.“Well yes. I’m working on my essay right now and wanted to reference something from that book. So if you’re not going to use it, I think you should give it to me.” Hermione babbled, still holding on to the two books in her arms. Malfoy abruptly stopped, making her shuffle back as he whipped around to face her.“But I’m also working on my essay. And if the great Hermione Granger needs this book, I can only assume I will also need it, yeah?” Malfoy said, his eyes glinting with playfulness and she felt her brain shut off for a mere moment as she looked into them.“Well—“ She began but stopped. Think Hermione. If he needed the book and was working on his essay, she had an opening to spend time with him. She swallowed once and let her stare fall to the book in his hand hanging loosely by his side. One thick vein was bulging across the top of his hand before disappearing under the sweater he wore. She glanced back up at him and his eyes narrowed.“There’s room at my table, you could—I mean we could share the book and work on the essay?” Her heart rate seemed to slow and for whatever reason, his jaw shifted and his cheeks moved upwards into a smile.“Fine with me.” He said and she nodded in return.“I’m up front.” She told him and he nodded once before heading off to where she assumed his things were. Hermione tucked a loose curl behind her ear and tightened her up-do. She only had a few moments to make a plan of attack, but his presence made her feel like she was the mouse and he was the cat. She needed to find her footing, gain some confidence and get him to bite instead of her blushing and stuttering all the time.He sat down, one chair away from her, back facing the door. There was a decent amount of space between them, but their books and sprawled parchment made them feel closer. Once he settled in and a comfortable silence had passed over them, Hermione cleared her throat.“So.” She began, eyes not lifting off her parchment. “Why don’t you ever visit Hogsmeade?”Draco looked up for a slim second, noting the color in her cheeks and wondering if it was a blush or some charm she did.“Don’t need to. Plus it’s the only time the library is quiet.” He told her honestly and she made a quiet ‘ah’ noise. Their quills scratched for a second longer and he spoke this time. “Why aren’t you there today?”“Didn’t need anything and I wanted to work on this essay.” She responded and met his eyes. He made a face, somewhere between amused and disbelieving. She felt defensive. “What?”“You’re lying.” He stated frankly and Hermione had to hold her breath to stop from sputtering.“I’m not.” She coolly told him even though her heart rate began to rise.“Really? Do you often come parading around the library dressed like that?” Malfoy nodded down to her and she looked down at her outfit, her body spreading with warmth and insecurity.“What’s wrong with my outfit?”“It’s not what you would usually wear to the library.” He commented as if it were known to everyone. “What happened? Get stood up for a date?”Hermione felt herself anger, but his face didn’t seem to be rude and harmful, he remained playful. She still  frowned at him and bit out an answer.“No. I decided to dress nicely for myself. I didn’t know I wasn’t allowed to dress in different styles.” She sarcastically said and Malfoy chuckled.“No one said that. Just an interesting observation, amongst other things.” He mumbled, a hint of a grin still on his face.“What’s that supposed to mean?” She said and crossed her arms and felt her insecurity rise.“Come on Granger. We’ve stayed our respective distance away from each other all year. All of a sudden you’re inviting me to work on an essay on some random Saturday? Seems like you’re plotting something.” Malfoy observed a little too close to home. If Hermione wasn’t already worked up, she may have faltered in her answer, but her irritation drove her into the debate.“Hold on. Let’s make this clear. You have stayed your respective distance, acting like I have the bloody plague. You’ve made it quite obvious how much you don’t want to be around me, going so far as to move seats on the opposite side during classes.” Hermione said and his grin grew.“Granger I didn’t exactly think you’d want the former death eater you unenthusiastically testified for to the Wizengamot in your way. I thought I was doing you a favor.” Malfoy responded easily, leaning back in his chair and throwing one shoulder over the back of it. Hermione looked at him wildly and almost laughed.“Doing me a favor?” Hermione asked with amusement and Malfoy nodded. She threw her head back and let out a single laugh. “I don’t need any favors from you. What a ludicrous reason to act so strange towards me.”“Considering that I wasn’t exactly sure how to apologize to you yet for my former transgressions, I figured keeping my distance was the best bet.” Malfoy explained, waving his hand with his words.“So is your distance your apology? Or will I actually receive one sometime in the future?” Hermione questioned with squinted eyes.“Well now that you’ve seemed to invade my space, it looks like I’ll have to give a verbal apology.” Malfoy replied bored.“Invaded your space? I’ve done no such thing.” Hermione defended and she almost believed herself.“Tripping me? Sitting next to me in charms, following me into the courtyard and moving up one desk over from me in Astronomy?” He challenged and she felt herself stiffen.“Tripping you was an accident and there were no other seats in charms. I told Daphne I’d sit next to her next Astronomy class.” She said but could feel her neck begin to sweat. He was asking all the right questions. He was either aware of something going on, or really just a paranoid man.“You lie so well.” Malfoy said.“I’m not lying.” She spat. Malfoy suddenly leaned forward from his chair and placed his elbow on their table. He craned his neck down to get closer to her eyeline and began to speak just above a whisper.“Don’t insult me Granger. It’s very obvious the girls are up to something this year and if I had to guess, I’d say your recent and odd behavior is because of it.”Hermione didn’t realize she was breathing hard, but one of her curls fell in front of her face after she released a long breath. She hastily moved it away and glared up at him. How dare he make assumptions, correctly at that.“Some of us thought it was wise to get to know each other rather than hold old and petty grudges. We survived a war after all. There are more important things in life.” She ranted to him and wanted to smack his stupid smirk off his face. Maybe she could just quickly flash him her tits right here and walk out. This was pointless and she was never going to accomplish her goal.“More important things like scheming to sleep with the upper year boys?” Malfoy asked and Hermione bit her tongue so hard she thought it was going to bleed all while she stopped breathing. It was just a guess, he was just guessing. She stayed silent for a moment then played dumb and acted confused.“Scheming? You’re delusional.” Hermione scoffed and leaned back into her chair to resume her writing. She slid the book towards her and Malfoy’s hand clapped down on it, his fingers brushing over hers to stop the movement.“Again, don’t insult me Granger. I know you girls think you have everyone else fooled, but it’s a little too obvious to miss.” He told her, his neck bending down to her and she raised forward in her chair to meet his stare.“Do you realize how insane that sounds Malfoy? There is. no. scheme.” Hermione emphasized the final sentence, her eyes piercing into his.“And I don’t buy it. You blew off Hogsmeade with your friends, you’re wearing…that and you willingly want to talk and work on an essay with me? I’m involved in your scheme, just admit it.” Malfoy demanded and Hermione scoffed.“Glad to see you haven’t lost your reliable sense of arrogance.” She scowled. The distance between their bodies continued to decrease as they went back and forth. No one in the library was around to notice them and they kept their voices considerably hushed for their spat.“I just know when I’m right, Granger.” He retaliated.“You have rarely been right, which includes now, Malfoy. Give it up and just accept you know nothing.” She said and tried to slide the book towards her once more but Malfoy snatched her wrist in his hand and raised a brow at her.“I’ll eventually find out.” He said lowly, his wicked grin making her stomach twist and turn once more. “In fact…I think I could persuade you to tell me.”Hermione’s body flushed as his voice lowered. His eyes turned dark and teasing, she realized how close they actually were. She could see a scar just above his eyebrow and could faintly feel his breath against the skin on her wrist. She swallowed once and tried to appear calm.“You can’t make me turn against my friends.” She said and didn’t mean for her voice to come out so breathy. Malfoy brought his other hand up to hold her forearm, she watched his long fingers stroke up and down her arm while his other hand opened up her palm. The ring he wore was gliding over her skin, cool metal meeting her heating flesh.“You sure?” He asked sweetly, his mouth dangerously close to her fingertips. He was massaging her palm with both hands now and she weakly tried to pull it away, but her body hummed as his eyes danced with hers.“What are you doing?” She questioned him. Not sure why she would, this was exactly what she wanted, but it felt odd for her former bully to be looking at her and touching her like this, on his own volition nonetheless.“Persuading you.” He stated obviously.Malfoy lowered his head into her hand and brought her fingertips to brush over his lips. Hermione gasped, eyes widened as he smiled at her. A shiver crawled over her body and ended in her center, her breathing was heavy and the only sound between them were her pants.Frozen in her chair, her attention was drawn to where her fingers swept over his plush lips. The tip of his tongue flicked over the top of her index finger and Hermione jerked in her seat, in utter awe at what she was allowing him to do. His hold on her tightened and for the first time in minutes, she remembered they were in their school library. Her head darted across the room in worry.“There’s two other people here, sitting in an alcove by the potions section.” He mumbled against her fingers, his hot breath making her digits damp.“M-Malfoy.” She meant to say it as a warning, in a tone to make him stop, but it came out like a pathetic whimper.“Granger.” He mimicked it, deep in his chest and rumbled across her skin until it settled into a warm puddle in her center.She watched as he parted his mouth over her index and middle finger, suckling the skin and flicking his tongue over it. He nibbled on the tips and then slowly took them into his mouth until he was halfway down.Hermione felt faint as he kept her eye contact. Her nipples hardened through her sweater and knickers became slick with arousal. His tongue felt so warm, his mouth so soft. She wondered if his tongue would move against her own like it was currently doing to her fingers, stroking her, gliding with her. The thought nearly made her sigh.Malfoy released her fingers, the wet sound popping from his lips. She felt gravity pull her into him, and she was pretty sure his head was swaying to her. Their eyes were low, faces coming together, breaths mingling as one.His hands were still holding her fingers and the smirk hadn’t left his features. She took a shuddering inhale before slowly closing her eyes when his gray eyes became blurry.“Get up.” He muttered, his breath hitting her cheeks. Her eyes flickered open and she slowly sat back to look at his face. He still held an interestingly arrogant look, but he looked carnal. Her heart was ringing in her ears and she had to steady her vision to focus.“What?” She asked in a whisper.“Get. Up.” He commanded, his voice light and amused. She furrowed her brow.“Wh—““Granger.” He cut her off, voice becoming dangerously low. “Get up and follow me. Don’t make me wait.”Without another word or second to hear her questions, Malfoy stood from his seat and began briskly walking away from the table. Hermione watched his long and slow strides, and felt herself vaguely annoyed that his cocky attitude didn’t make him turn his head once to see if she was following. She had half a mind to just leave the library.She wouldn’t though. The enticement in their unusual and hot exchange made her stand up and walk in a trance a few paces behind him. He made a quick right into an aisle, leaning up against the massive shelf next to a single desk. His hands stuffed into his pocket, eyes curiously watching her slowing steps.“Get on the desk.” He softly said, nodding beside him with his head. Hermione still felt dazed, but she stared at him with skepticism.“Why?” She asked, her tone quiet. She was afraid to speak louder, to break the fragile shell it felt like they were in. He rolled his eyes but a small dimple formed on the corner of his lip.“Ever curious. Can’t you just do what you’re told? You’re good at following instructions, yeah?” Malfoy turned to face her and Hermione resisted the urge to take a step back.“I suppose.” She mumbled, unsure where he was going with this and what was going to come next. The air felt heavy, and her confidence was fleeting with each lustful stare he sent her.“Then do what you’re told and get on the desk.” His voice deepened. The sound roused her core and the annoyance she felt for no longer being in control was weakening with every second. She rotated her jaw and took a half step to the side, grasping the desk behind her and sliding her bum over the wood. Her ankles crossed automatically and his eyes flitted down to the motion. He dragged them slowly up her body, stopping for a few moments over the few inches of exposed thigh then up to her face. He smiled.Malfoy stepped towards her until her knees touched his thighs, her upper body tilted backwards so she could look at him better. His fingertips trailed up the seam of her socks, touching her so lightly she was hardly sure he was making contact. When the pads of his fingers met the end of the sock, her mouth parted as he touched her bare skin. Her body noticeably shook.“Hmmm, let’s begin.” Malfoy hummed, his expression still pleased. “I know you meet every Thursday, what I want to know is what spells you use to disillusion an entire common room.”His fingers slid high up her thighs, meeting the end of her skirt. She swallowed and looked down to where his fingers were slowly disappearing under the material. It felt like he was searing a brand into her thighs and she fought the feeling to clamp her thighs together.“I’m not telling you.” She whispered, her chest heaving air.“No?” He asked, hands totally under her skirt. Her thigh muscles jolted and he rested his wide palms on her, sliding them up and down her leg. “What can I do to change your mind, Granger?”“Nothing.” She breathed out, looking back down to where his arms were resting on her body.“I’ll guess then, and if I’m right, you’ll tell me.” He said, angling his face closer down to her own. Her knuckles were white and cramping from the strength she was using to grip the desk. Her arms were locked straight and when his face angled to her ear, she tightly shut her eyes to clear her vision. Her gaze rested anxiously on the other end of the aisle.Malfoy’s hands slithered upward, his short nails softly scratching her heating skin. She couldn’t help but shiver, the wave pulsing to her nipples and she found herself sighing deeply.“A disillusionment charm and protective wards? A confundus?” He asked, fingers touching the spot were her hips and thighs creased, drifting over the cotton material of her panties.“Maybe.” She somehow gasped out, smiling to herself when his fingers stiledl. Hermione was proud for not succumbing to his little game. His nose suddenly traced the sensitive skin on her ear, his lips right at her lobe.“You’re going to tell me otherwise every person in the library is going to hear you get off on my fingers.” He growled, his fingers digging under her knickers. She inhaled sharply and heard him huff out a half chuckle. “Or maybe you’d like that? Granger the bookworm gets off on being a dirty slut in public, eh?”Hermione’s neck tilted back, his words shocking her system and igniting a fire in her core. He quickly ripped her knickers down, the fabric burning past her bum as he didn’t wait for her to make it easier to remove them. They pooled around her ankles and Malfoy took a step back. A wash of cool air circling her body. She peeled her eyes open to stare at the steel pair of eyes, catching him licking his lips with a dangerous smile.“Spread your legs.” He requested and Hermione didn’t move an inch. Malfoy raised a brow and crossed his arms over his chest. “It’s either spread your legs, or I’ll spread them for you.”She hesitated for a second longer before barely inching her thighs open. She had never been spoken to like this, but the demands, the tone and the man giving it all were hypnotizing. She wanted to comply, wanting to see what would happen if she did.“Such a good girl. Knew there was a reason you’re the brightest witch of our age.” He teased and returned close to her body. He shifted down and her body froze. His face wasn’t far from her throbbing center and the stupid little grin he wore made her muscles shake.His hands reached for her knickers and he removed them from her ankles before stuffing them in his pocket. He rose back up to his feet and lightly pushed her knees apart.“Little wider for me.” He breathed out and opened her legs wide enough for him to stand in-between them.  His hands slid back under her skirt, pushing the material just before it exposed her now free cunt. Her body was warm, blood pumping fast as he crowded her. Malfoy leaned forward into her, her eyes just over his shoulder as his mouth skimmed over her ear.“Now cast the spell you use for your little get-togethers.” He ordered as his left hand skimmed over her mound. Her body shuddered and his heavy tone made her eyes flutter closed.“I can’t.” She whispered, thankful his fingers were still feathering over her fleshy skin.“And why not?” He asked thoughtfully.“It takes a few minutes for the spell to work.” She revealed, jerking when his pointer finger traced downwards. His other hand tightly gripped her thigh, keeping her in place.“Cast it.” He commanded, his damp lips moving against her earlobe. She released a sigh and accidentally rested her head against him, wanting more of the teasing feeling from his lips.“I—it won’t work. I-I’m not concentrating.” She sighed when his tongue licked her skin.His finger ran down her folds opening her slit, stopping down at her entrance and circling it to test how wet she was. He made a humming noise of approval and Hermione rested back against her hands, jerking her hips to him.“Then tell me the spell, since I’m…concentrated.”As he spoke the last word, he inserted his finger into her warm and wet center. Hermione let out a rather loud sigh and her head rolled back onto her shoulders. Malfoy’s free hand reached up and fisted her hair at the back of her head, forcing her to stay upright. Their noses touched over each other and their vision was unfocused on one another.“The spell Granger.” He stated, eyebrows raising. He pumped his finger a few times, her chest rising and falling deeply. Her walls fluttered around him with every push and pull, but he slowly began to remove and still his movements. Her eyes widened with a pleading look and she nearly whimpered.“Repello magia civitatis and cave inimicum.” She told him and was immediately rewarded with a second finger thrusting into her. She moaned softly and Malfoy smirked down at her. He found her attractive as hell and knew this little game would be so much fun.“Good girl.” He mumbled and twisted his fingers inside her while removing his wand. Hermione watched in fascination as he casted the spells and silencing charms all while bringing her insane waves of pleasure with just two fingers.She looked down to where he joined their bodies, seeing his wrist and forearm flex, and his veins push against his porcelain skin. The bulge in his pants was growing, and her eyes widened at the already large size of it. She wetted her lips and looked back up to him, watching him place his wand away.Draco’s hand returned to her hair, yanking her face up to his. She panted in his face, eyes lingering on his subtle grin before settling on his stare. He pumped his fingers a little harder and Hermione could feel her own wetness slide against the desk, she almost cared, but his long digits took her mind away from the embarrassing notion.“Now you can be as loud as you want.” He spoke quietly before fusing their lips together and inserting two fingers into her waiting centerHermione moaned loudly into his mouth, his tongue aggressively tangling with hers. His digits thrusted so deep inside her, hitting the soft part of her walls that made her cry into his mouth. Her hands reached up and clasped around his neck, nails scratching his scalp.Her legs wrapped around his hips, making her lean back into the grip on her hair and shifting her center closer to him. The angle made her clench around him hard and the pressure from his palm on her clit fanned the growing fire that was ready to explode in her body.Malfoy felt her tighten around his fingers, he smirked into their kiss and pulled away, kissing down her neck and sucking her skin hard.“So wet for me, such a good fucking slut for me.” He groaned into her heating and slightly sweating skin.She gasped loudly, her fingers tightening their hold around his neck. He was unsatisfied with her lack of responses, though her breathy moans and constant whimpers shoot blood straight into his cock.“Tell me how good my fingers feel. Tell me how much you want to come.” He demanded, roughly withdrawing his fingers and pushing his palm into her clit. Hermione didn’t say anything, she just cried through her lips, mumbling against his.”You’re getting finger fucked by me in the library now is not the time for prudence.” He growled against her throat, teeth nibbling at the skin right under her ear. “Now, be a good fucking slut and tell me you want to come.”Hermione couldn’t fathom why his dirty talk did so much to her, but she felt herself eager to comply with him.“Yes, I want to come.” She finally said, suddenly feeling like his two fingers weren’t big enough to fill her. She moved her hips into his palm, her clit begging for harder friction. His lips dragging over her neck were sending her into a tail spin.“You wanna come on my fingers?” He continued asking but her mind was barely coherent.“Yes.” She hissed, her thighs shaking and slick with her dripping arousal“Say it.” He demanded, his fingers rubbing her sensitive wall.“Fuck, Malfoy come on—“ She whined but her firmly gripped her neck, his thumb pushing into her jugular and making her look at him.“Fucking say it.”Her eyes were round with lust and slight fogginess. She was unaware of her surroundings, almost of herself, but she was certain of her next words.“I want to c-come on your fingers, Malfoy.” She stuttered out, sounding so needy and desperate but her voice came out sultry and demanding. His grey eyes narrowed at her, his tongue resting on his top canine. He adjusted his pace so his palm roughly dragged against her clit. Her thighs tightened, a warmth spread in her toes and grew upwards.Malfoy grinned like a demon and quickly removed his fingers, enjoying the way her eyes seemed to glaze with tears and burning red with anger, desperation and confusion.“What—?” She asked, and Malfoy roughly gripped her thighs so she wouldn’t be able to shut them to find friction. His fingertips dug so deep into her skin she almost winced from the beginning feelings of pain. He spread her open wider, a cool air drifting over her. It felt so intense she shut her eyes and almost felt herself come from just from the refreshing air.Her skin was on fire, her clit was throbbing for attention and body was so uncomfortably tight from her lack of release. Draco felt faint. He could smell her slick heat, feel her hot pants over his face and felt her thigh muscles struggle against his hold. He had no idea she’d be so responsive to him, and now that he knew, he was going to have all the fun he wanted.“I fucking knew you’d be like this.” He gleefully said, completely satisfied with her.She didn’t understand his comment, there wasn’t enough oxygen in her brain to make sense of his words. He leaned forward and sucked on her bottom lip, running his tongue over it before pulling away with a snap.“I expect you to keep this encounter between us.”She stared at him puzzled, anger and need still coursing through her blood.“What do you mean?” She inquired and Draco leaned closer to her, his right eye twitching.“I know more than you think. And I’m telling you right now, if I get wind that your little gang of girls find out about today, then you will be left with nothing.” He threatened.Hermione felt offended and proceeded to push herself off the desk, but his hands held her firmly in place.“Swear you won’t say anything and I can guarantee you’ll be…rewarded.” He smirked with a snarl that was far too attractive for him to be wearing.“I don’t bloody well care about what you want.”  She snidely said and he amusedly raised a brow.“Yes you do.” He lowly said and began to slide his hands back up her thigh. Hermione’s posed face broke just the slightest and Draco knew he won. “You’re not going to tell anyone because you want me to get you off.”His fingertips crept to her inner thigh, causing a shiver to spread through her body.“You want me to call you a dirty little slut while you come from the pleasure I bring you.”Hermione wanted to curse at him, and when she opened her mouth, the only sound she made was a soft gasp as he flicked a finger against her clit. Her cunt clenched and clenched, her heart beating much too fast for what was normal.“My fun with you is just beginning and I highly doubt you’re looking to end it without getting what you want.” He confidently spoke, rendering her speechless. “Don’t tell anyone, don’t even let on that I know anything. Do that and something good will come your way.”He smirked while looking over her face once and then tore his body away from her, Hermione had to close her thighs and hold her arms taut so she wouldn’t fall over. He strode away without another word, leaving her to contemplate what the hell she got herself into.

Students filed through the Great Hall later that evening and Hermione anxiously waited on one of the benches for her friends to enter. She waved over Ginny and chewed on the inside of her cheek while she walked over.

“How was it?” Hermione asked as Ginny sat down. The red head sighed and plopped a small bag down in front of Hermione. 

“Good! Lisa and Theo were all cuddled up in Three Broomsticks and I saw Zabini grope Daph’s arse on the way back, so I have no idea where those two are.” Ginny told her and Hermione raised her eyebrows at the news. Well, at least she wasn’t the only one with a productive day. 

“Did you get anything from town?” 

“I got you a chocolate wand, I got me a fizzy wizzies that I already ate and a new pair of quidditch pants.” Ginny pulled out the candy and handed it to Hermione. 

“Oh thank you. How thoughtful.” She stated and unwrapped the wand.

“Mhm. So…how was your afternoon?” Ginny asked with a bouncing and light tone. Her eyes glowed with excitement and she leaned down to make sure no one would hear their conversation. 

Hermione looked at her friend for a moment and smiled while lightly sucking on the chocolate wand before breaking a piece off in her mouth. 

“Well,” She began, chewing on the sweet candy. “I did manage to find Malfoy in the library.” 

“Ooo. Okay and? Did he like your outfit? You’re not in it anymore so I can only assume maybe he saw you out of it?” Ginny lowered her voice, eyes floating behind her curly head for a moment. 

Hermione blushed for a moment and set her wand down. She bowed her head, not wanting any others to over hear their conversation. 

“He liked the outfit, definitely. I asked him if he wanted to work on an essay with me so we worked side by side for a bit. He made a few comments about my outfit and—“ 

“Yes! I knew the outfit was a good choice that’s probably why he’s been staring at you since he walked in.” Ginny whispered into a squeal but Hermione froze, her cheeks burning hot. 

“He’s, he’s staring at me?” She asked quietly and Ginny nodded wildly. 

“He’s at the table behind you, over to your right. Looks like he’s ready to devour you.” She gaped and Hermione forced a smile before cautiously turning over her shoulder to find him. 

Ginny was right. He did look like he was going to devour her, at least that’s how he appeared to everyone else. But Hermione knew that look wasn’t meaningful, it was a warning, and when his silver eyes lowered, they challenged her. She gulped once, her neck tingling with heat and then returned her attention back to her friend. 

“Gods I can only imagine what transpired to cause him to look at you like that.” Ginny commented. 

“Yes, well we—he…he came over and we worked on the essay and he actually…just erm, responded to flirting. It was kinda hot, a few igniting touches.” Hermione lied as best as she could, slightly squirming in her seat since she could still feel his stare. 

“Awesome! What did he say?” Ginny asked while breaking off a piece of Hermione’s chocolate wand, none the wiser to her friend’s obvious discomfort and lies. 

“Just that I looked nice. And we started going back and forth about the essay but it felt like flirting? I don’t know, it was all heat of the moment.” Hermione bit down on the wand and avoided her friend’s eyes. 

“That’s great. Seems like all the girls had a good day then.” 

Hermione agreed and Ginny began discussing getting her holiday shopping out of the way soon. She briefly zoned out, adding input when needed. Hermione’s mind was on edge and she chanced another look over her shoulder. Of course he was still looking, only this time, an expression of satisfaction covered his features and she watched as he stood from his table and walked out of the Great Hall. She released a large breath she was unaware of holding. 

The following week, Hermione felt like a baby deer learning how to walk for the first time all over again. She was excessively clumsy and it was largely due to the fact that Malfoy was seemingly toying with her. 

It began in potions. Hermione moved to the supply closet, gathering items when she heard heavy feet pad in. Not wanting to take up too much space in the already cramped area, she turned to move and let her classmate have their space. 

Except she only turned halfway to the door when a strong force tugged her back into their chest, and a hand muzzled her mouth, keeping her shrieks quiet. Her chest was heaving air and she nearly dropped her vials, but the warm breath at her ear and the deep voice that spoke made her melt like lava. 

“You didn’t tell anyone what happened right?” He growled into her ear, his hand parting her robes. She breathed heavily into his palm, making it damp with every exhale. Hermione shook her head no and felt his lips curve into a smile at her ear. 

“Good girl.” His hand untucked the front of her blouse from her pants and soft fingers soon brushed against her bare stomach. She quivered at the sensation, softly sighing and leaned back into him. “I’ll pleasantly treat you if you keep our secret. Can you do that for me?” 

His hand snaked under the wire of her bra and began groping the heavy flesh of her breast. Malfoy sucked at the skin by her ear, a sensitive spot he gravitated to and Hermione wavered in her stance. His tongue lapped at the spot while his fingers pinched her nipple. She groaned, his hand pushing harder into her mouth to keep her quiet. 

Hermione hastily nodded and Malfoy kissed her neck once before removing his touch and body off of her. She staggered, and looked over her shoulder to find him grabbing a random ingredient and leaving her alone in the closet. She was panting and quickly reorganized herself to not look so wild. Luckily for her, her appearance always looked wild in potions class, so no one noticed her round pupils and flushed skin, except him. Malfoy wore an evil smirk for the remainder of class.

After that encounter, she couldn’t have embarrassed herself worse in front of him and her friends. Any time they passed in the halls, her eyes would linger on him and she would stumble into someone in front of her, trip over her own feet or just totally blank out. 

Tuesday was a particularly bad night. She had been studying in the library but unsuccessfully accomplished any real work since she would peer around the venue every five minutes to see if a blonde man strolled in. Huffing after two hours, Hermione promptly left, feeling discouraged that she hadn’t seen or spoken to him all day. 

Her footsteps echoed throughout the castle and as she was lost in her daydreams of veiny, muscular hands and big feet, she soon heard rampant footfalls behind her. Her stride stopped but the feet behind her did not. His dark voice rang in her ears in seconds. 

“Looking for me?” Draco questioned. She couldn’t feel his body but he was close enough to sense his body heat. She itched for him to touch her. 

“N-no.” She mentally hit herself in the head. Way to sound confident and assertive. Malfoy clicked his tongue disapprovingly. 

“You’re not supposed to lie to

Granger.” He snarled and then shockingly quick spun her body to face him then pinned her into a window. The cold glass soothed her clothed back and she softly moaned at the force of his body pushing into hers. 

His hand closed around her throat, thumb finding her artery like before and he hovered his lips right over hers, letting her feel the thick moisture their pants were procuring. Her neck craned up, desperate for another touch from him, eager to feel his tongue on hers once more. Draco noticed her movement and pulled away slightly, smirking like a kid given candy. 

“Already craving me, huh?” He sneered but it didn’t feel malicious. “I’ll give you a taste only after you’ve proven yourself to me.” 

He grinded his hips into hers, both of them releasing pleasuring sighs. He was half hard and Hermione’s eyes rolled back as she felt the erected member. Even if it wasn’t fully what she needed, the friction against her middle was enough to hold her off a bit. 

“And trust me, I’m dying to get a taste of you too.” He emphasized his words by taking her bottom lip into his mouth and sucking hardly on it. His tongue soothed the plump skin he bit, and he suddenly released it with a small noise. 

He let go of her and began walking backwards, making a show of the way he eyed her body. 

“Night Granger.” He said and turned on his heel, leaving her heaving air against the window. She took her bottom lip into her own mouth and licked it, lightly shutting her eyes when she could still taste his own flavor on it.

It was the worst on Wednesday during Ancient Runes when Malfoy decided to sit right behind her. She was already profusely blushing as she kept her eyes on his teasing smirk and when she pulled out her chair, she completely missed the seat, falling right on her arse with a loud noise. 

Her face was beet red and Padma helped her up. 

“Blimey Hermione. Are you alright?” She asked, pulling her hand to steady her balance. 

“Yeah, yeah, just miscalculated.” She mumbled, heat blooming across her skin. 

“With the week you’re having Granger, we may have to put you in a suit of armor.” Zabini joked while sitting beside Draco. She offered a light smile and tried to laugh it off as she avoided a certain heated stare. 

“I might look into that actually, thanks for the suggestion Zabini.” She turned back around in her chair, her bum aching a bit as she sat. She squirmed throughout the period as Draco’s large foot tapped her chair leg every so often. 

She looked over her shoulder a few times and furrowed her brow at him as if to ask him ‘what?’ But he never met her gaze, his eyes were always focused on the lesson or his own work. It was driving her up a wall. What was the point of irritating her if he wasn’t even going to give her attention? 

Their class ended and Hermione scuffled out of the room, walking so fast out of the halls and onto the grounds, needing the biting air of November to help cool her off and clear her mind. Thankfully she was done with classes for the day, and her only other obligation was prefect rounds tonight. 

She walked down the hill and found a soft grassy spot far enough away from the castle that no one would come over unless looking for her. She threw her book bag on the ground and sat down but immediately flinched when her bruising skin hit the hard grass. She casted a cushioning charm and released a deep breath. The weather was gray and cloudy, winds more forgiving today but leaves still danced across the open fields.

Leaning back on her palms, Hermione closed her eyes for the briefest moments. Irritation rose deep in her chest and she felt her cheek spasm from how tightly she was clenching her teeth down. Feeling sexually charged by a boy was not something she was used to, nor has she ever felt so frustrated and confused before in her life. 

Initially, she thought that maybe the day in the library was a total fluke. She told herself over and over that his words and actions were found utterly arousing because it had been so long since she felt that addictive ache between her thighs and not because she liked the way he spoke to her. But now she knew that was a lie. 

She felt dirty that his aggressive actions and words made her knickers wet. Humiliation crept into her mind knowing that Draco Malfoy could easily turn her on by being a predator. It wasn’t who she was. No. Hermione liked attentive and deep touches, she liked giving as long as she was receiving and thoroughly enjoyed a consuming passion that fully satiated her. 

She didn’t enjoy being teased. Absolutely hated how easily flustered she became around him. It was infuriating. Seeking her out during the week had done nothing to ease her nerves. If anything, it made her more antsy. Not to mention that tomorrow was Thursday and she wasn’t sure how convincing she was going to be to the group, and the fact that she told Malfoy their protective enchantments had made her feel like a traitor. 

Casting a warming charm around her, she decided to spend a little longer outside, needing her mind to clear before she embarrassed herself further in front of others. But of course, her solitude wouldn’t last. She heard the crunchy footsteps on grass behind her and she huddled her knees together before looking to view the visitor. 

She groaned out loud. 

“Bloody hell. I swear you’re using a locator spell on me.” Hermione gruffly stated, resting her chin on her knee caps as Draco sat a few feet beside her.

“I’m just observant. You should know that by now.” He refuted and Hermione snorted, her eyes casted over the hills and watched as the clouds moved. 

“I came out here to be alone. If you were so observant you would have picked up on that.” She fired back. It was unbelievable how her heart began to pick up speed as she saw him lean back on his palms. He looked so unbothered, calm and collected, meanwhile she was sweating any time she saw him lick his lips. 

“I did pick up on it.” His voice seemed bored. 

“Well then…leave me alone.” She plainly stated. 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because.” He laughed and the sound made her turn her head to him. It was maybe the first time she ever heard him laugh sincerely. “You seemed agitated so I came to see why.”

“Why?” She raised her voice, a disbelieving laugh coming out. “You know why! It feels like I’ve been corralled by you this whole week, I’ve been unfocused and clumsy, making a bloody fool of myself and I don’t even get to tell my friends what’s going on.” She pouted at the end, making Draco chuckle once more. 

“Sounds like you need something to take your mind off it.” He smugly replied.

“No. That’s the exact reason why I’m all…worked up.” She protested just to disagree with him. 

“You’re sexually frustrated Granger, which means I’m doing this right.” 

Draco said and Hermione looked at him, finding his notorious glinting grin. His gray eyes matched the sky today but his for some reason looked brighter. She inhaled a large breath and decided that if he could mess with her head, she at least had a right to ask some questions.

“If I may,” She began, Draco raised an eyebrow at her already knowing what she was going to ask, “why are you…” she trailed off unsure of what she wanted to ask first. 

“Why am I…? Seeking you out? Why are my sexual preferences aggressive? Why have I been so cryptic this week?” He listed and Hermione looked at the rolling clouds. 

“I guess all of the above.” Draco made a humming noise and cracked his neck, tilting it from one side to the other, his bones making loud and sickly noises.

“I would guess my sexual preferences come from the fact that my teenage years have been dictated either by my wonderful parental figures or the psychopath that lived in my house for a year. I didn’t have control and now I do.” 

Hermione thought over his response and raised her eyebrows in surprise. 

“That…makes a lot of sense actually. Especially since you may hold a lot of anger and regret over your previous decisions. Sexual preferences can take on many forms during teenage years. It could explain why—“ 

“Granger.” He cut off her out loud thought process going on. She looked at him blankly. 

“Yes?”

“We don’t need to delve deeper into my why’s.” He smirked.

“S-sure, of course.” She blushed that she found him more curious and accidentally talked her thoughts out loud. Tucking some of her blowing hair behind her ear, she continued her questions. “But then, why are you so…interested in me?”

“Why are you interested in me?” He shot back and she felt her mouth go dry at the cheeky expression he wore. 

“I-I think you’re attractive and intelligent so why not?” Her body was overheating, she plucked some longer straws of grass and started making a pile. She wasn’t brave enough to look at him after she made the admission. Even if she wouldn’t have sought him out in normal conditions, she could see herself finding someone like Malfoy attractive. She wondered for a second if they would have been romantically or physically involved ever had their history never been.

“Inflating my ego might have been a bad move. You could’ve just told me the truth.” He responded. 

“That

the unfortunate truth.” She said. Granted, there were big parts missing but she still thought her words true. “So, what about you then?”

Malfoy nodded and regarded the witch beside him. Cheeks were a dark pink either because of her own body heat or the whipping cold weather. Her face had shown some growth, cheekbones seemed more pronounced and jaw a little longer. She looked older and her confidence this year was like a glowing halo around her. 

“I think the same.” He stated, and she gave out a bearing laugh. “I’m being serious. But I never expected you to be a suitable partner.” 

As he finished, his eyes trailed over her body a little longer than necessary but Hermione scowled at him.

“Does that mean—

“No its not about your fucking blood would you stop already?” He groaned while rolling his eyes and throwing a pebble down the hill

“Forgive me. It’s hard to believe that years of firm and oppressive beliefs just magically disappeared.” She snarked, watching the rock tumble down and down the hill.

“Well believe it.” He bit back, his eyes twitching as he spoke.

There was an uncomfortable silence that hung between them and Hermione wished that he would get up and leave. If he wasn’t here to get her off then there was no need for him to continue to bother her. 

“What I meant was that I never thought swotty, know-it-all, Gryffindor’s princess is into being more submissive in the bedroom.” He commented and Hermione made a face. 

“I’m not into being a submissive and we didn’t do anything in the bedroom.” She huffed and crossed her arms childishly. Draco gave her a funny look and thought her denial was comical. 

“What would you call what took place in the library then?” He pushed. 

“A lapse of judgement.” She stuck her chin but her mind called her a liar. Draco chortled and mockingly sighed. 

“You have a smart answer for everything don’t you?” He asked rhetorically but she answered anyway. 

“I’m being honest. I’m not into…whatever happened over the weekend. I enjoy—“ 

“Let me guess. You’re into a wizard who takes his time with you, you like the gradual build up but don’t like waiting too long. You like being on top because otherwise you won’t come.” He assessed and Hermione tried her best to remain stoic, but her poker face faltered and Draco could see the corner of her mouth twitch. He continued on, knowing he was getting a rise out of her. 

“Look you can obviously like that. But I think you enjoy what we did more. If you deny it you’re a bloody liar.” He said and she turned her head with her mouth open at him, offense written all over her face. 

“Who are you to tell me what I enjoy more?” She demanded. Never will she let a man tell her something about

herself. 

“Because your body sang to me like a fucking choir. You didn’t even come and I could smell you on my fingers for days after.” Draco said, his eyes darkening to something dangerous. 

Hermione let an involuntary shiver run across her body and of course he fucking noticed. Taking in a deep breath, she let her agitation guide her. Something led her to fight him a little, maybe because her blood was warming at the way he was staring at her, or maybe it was his words. 

“So what? You think one encounter makes you a sodding expert on my body?” 

She narrowed her focus on him and immediately stiffened when he turned his body on one side facing her. He was significantly closer and could reach out to comfortably rest his hand on her leg if he wanted.

“No. But from our little interactions in between, it reaffirms you like the way I am with you.” Half his mouth turned upwards, his facing daring her to disagree with him. “I saw the way you shut your legs together for the remainder of class in Potions on Monday.” He began and she tried not to gasp. 

“And I could feel your heart thrumming with excitement under my hand last night. Got a little rougher with you and you loved it. Tell me Granger, do you usually enjoy when a guy chokes you, or am I just special?” His voice was becoming softer but somehow deeper. Her mouth parted and she tried to think of something witty to say. 

“Piss off.” She weakly said instead, her mind jumbled with thoughts from yesterday and the pressure he had on her neck.

“I think it’s just me. I think you like being told what to do, you like when someone else focuses on you and you certainly like it a little more rougher. And I bet if I were to reach into your knickers right now, you wouldn’t stop me and I would feel how wet you are.”

Oh fuck.

And fuck him too for being such an arrogant and attractive prick. 

As he spoke, Hermione felt her breathing pick up. Her reactions were getting harder and harder to conceal.  She wanted to be as faceless as she knew she could be, but there was no hiding from him and he knew that too. 

He had all the control.

For a moment she remembered the purpose of all this and her eyes fell downwards. Nothing could be seen through his trousers though, damn.  

“Granger?” Draco called and her doe-like eyes wound up back on him. His tongue was resting on his top canine, a grin seeping into his features as he regarded her.

“Are you wet?” 

Her nipples hardened at his dark words and god fucking dammit there was no logical reason that she should have such a strong reaction to him. It didn’t make sense. They were fire and ice, black and white, Gryffindor and Slytherin. This shouldn’t feel good to her, but something about how wrong it all felt made it feel that much better. 

“Not sure.” She tried to sound neutral but her voice became quiet as she watched his hand openly rub his erection through his trousers. 

“I’d bet my entire fortune you’re soaking through your knickers.” He remarked with a knowing look. “Prove me right. Reach inside your trousers for me and show me how wet you are.” 

Draco challenged and continued to rub himself as his eyes shamelessly ran over her body. Her cheeks flushed and she was shocked that he was blatantly doing this in the open field. Hermione was dressed in uniform, not doing anything but yet here he was, looking at her like he did in the library. 

Her hand hesitantly lifted and Draco’s eyes snapped to the movement. His lip quirked up and then he peered back at her, his gaze too satisfying for her to stop now. 

“That’s it Granger.” He purred, leisurely stroking his erection, the outline of his sticking through his pant material. “Go ahead and touch yourself.” 

Hermione’s hand moved downwards and she matched his position by leaning back on her one palm to get better access. Her eyes were dancing between his eyes and erection, mouth completely dry as she took in his concealed size. 

As soon as her cool fingertips brushed against her warm clit, she sucked in a sharp breath through her teeth. Draco squeezed the base of his cock at the sound, eyes lowering to where her hand was disappearing. 

She was absolutely drenched. 

Her body quivered, her cunt tightening as she slowly dipped her finger down her slit. 

“Let me see.” He ordered and Hermione stared at him. There wasn’t a need to find the request humiliating, but she still faltered at his words. Mainly because she didn’t want him to be right, the cocky bastard. 

“Show me your wet fingers.” He said more forcefully, voice still impossibly raspy. “I know you want to be a good fucking slut for me, show me your fingers.” 

Like a moth drawn to the light, Hermione felt herself compelled by his words. She withdrew her fingers and as soon as the shining digits were visible, Draco snatched her hand by the wrist. 

Hermione gasped when she felt his hot breath on her fingers. He looked up at her from under his eyelids, mouth parting with an evil smirk. His lips took in her digits, warm mouth and tongue sucking around her. He kept his eye contact, watching her brown irises darken with blackness. 

He released her hand and slowly pulled his mouth off. Malfoy crassly licked his lips and made a humming noise. Hermione found herself shocked briefly, wondering why the action, though on its face grotesque and filthy, made her ache even more. 

A bright smile appeared on his face seconds after, and Hermione felt blinded by how attractive he looked. His interest in her made no sense and she almost opened her mouth again to ask why he was so keen on pursuing these interesting activities. 

“Remember yourself tomorrow.” He warned as he stood up, leaving her to her thoughts and sexual frustration once more. She groaned out loud once he thought he was far enough away, but Draco still heard and stifled a laugh. 

“Progress reports! Lisa. You’re up first though I think everyone here is well aware of where you stand with Theo.” Ginny began, smirking at the girl who was on her way to officially dating the Slytherin. 

“Obviously Hogsmeade was a success last weekend and we’re going again together this weekend. He’s stolen a few chaste kisses, he’s quite the gentleman when he wants to be and I think he’s going to ask me to go steady with him on Saturday.” Lisa smiled so brightly with a rising blush on her face as some of the girls awed and cheered for her. 

“Who would’ve thought our little annoying Theo would go gooey eyed for Ms. Turpin here. Cheers love.” Daphne said and Lisa sarcastically bowed her head. 

“And do not worry ladies, once I find out his size, he will still be added to our history book.” Lisa confidentially said and then the girls erupted into applause. 

“So Parv, is Terry Boot still a virgin?” Padma asked as she jabbed her sister’s side. 

“Yes, he’s still a virgin but…” She hung off her sentence, looking around the Slytherin common room at the girl’s anxious faces. “He did, for the first time ever, perform cunnilingus and receive his very first blowie!” 

The girls shouted with glee and the dungeons vibrated with applause at the revelation. Parv flipped her hair over her shoulder and waved to the girls with a knowing smile and jokingly acted like she just won something as big as the Quidditch World Cup. 

“So how was it?” Ginny asked. 

“He was average at giving, but did a pretty good job considering it was his first time. Definitely aimed to please.” Parv winked with a smirk. “But that’s not even the best part.” She said as she began to reach into her sweater pocket and revealed to the group a bright yellow banana. 

“Terry Boot has a curved cock and it looks almost exactly like this.” Parv said as she raised the banana in the air then tossed it over to Daphne.

“Very interesting indeed.” Daphne said as she inspected the fruit. “We’ve never discussed a curved one. This opens up so many new possibilities and questions.” 

“I kinda liked it.” Parv said with a shrug and the girls laughed. “What? It’s different. Nothing wrong with it.” 

“Okay okay, it’s fourteen point six eight. Just past average but not big enough to be considered above average.” Ginny said as she measured the banana. “This is accurate?” 

“Yeah. Did a little test run and it’s the perfect match.” Parvati explained and Ginny frowned with a disgusted look as she threw the banana back at her. 

“How’s Blaise, Daph?” Ginny asked as she wiped her hands off on her jeans. 

“He’s getting more handsy with me so it’s only a matter of time before we get down and dirty. I actually had an idea to help move things along that involves everyone.” She explained and the group waited patiently for her to continue. 

“I think it would be worthwhile to have a Christmas party before holiday leave. With a mixer and some harmless games, the boys might be filled with holiday cheer.” She said with certain emphasis. 

“We should have it in Hufflepuff’s common room, since it’s more spacious.” Cho suggested and some of the Hufflepuff girls agreed. 

“We only have two and half weeks to plan and get the word out, but that should be long enough right?” Hermione began planning in her head, trying to think of ways and routes for people to roam the castle without getting caught. Maybe people would use buddy systems and have to follow a timed schedule to avoid wandering teachers. 

“We’ll make it work. But Granger. How’s Malfoy doing? I thought I saw you two out in the hills yesterday.” Daphne asked with a smirk that made her shift in her seat. Did she know? Of course not that would be preposterous. They were far enough away from the castle that no one would have seen what they were up to. 

“He followed me after class.” She started, feeling her chest suddenly bloom with warmth. “Just came to tease me about falling on my arse, flirted some more, just chatted really.” She shook her head and tried to pull her most convincing face. 

“Slow start to friends then to fuck buddies may work. Draco’s a man after all, he’s not going to resist that apple bum forever.” Padma said with a giggle. 

“Apple bum?” Hermione asked with a laugh but Ginny interrupted with a snap. 

“Focus girls. Do any of our volunteers need help? Or should we just focus on the party for the next two meetings?” Everyone in the group nodded and Hermione felt herself breathe a sigh of relief knowing that she wasn’t going to be asked about Draco in the weeks to come. 

Some of the girls left the common room but others stuck around just to chat. Hermione gathered her things and told Ginny she’d see her later then promptly left. She made it a few paces outside of the dungeons when she heard quick and fast paced steps behind her, like someone was trying to catch up to her. 

Hermione looked over her shoulder and saw a second year Slytherin girl jogging up to her, she stopped and turned to face her. 

“Um, this is for you.” The little girl outstretched her hand and gave Hermione a folded piece of paper. Hermione looked at the little girl and rose a brow. 

“Do you know what this says?” She curiously asked, hoping the sender wasn’t stupid enough to think their secret would be safe with a second year. 

“No, it’s charmed so only the intended reader can view it.” The girl said while biting her nail. Hermione inspected the parchment, noticing the handwriting and felt her cheeks heat. She looked back up at the expectant student. 

“Oh, um thank you.” She said with a smile and the little girl nodded then scurried away. 

Hermione looked around to ensure no when else was near, then ducked behind an alcove to open the note. 

Come to the dungeons tomorrow before dinner. I have something special for you.

Hermione’s stomach knotted as she read over his words. Licking her lips, her mind drifted to the possibilities of all the different ways Draco Malfoy would touch her tomorrow. 

Hermione was antsy for a majority of the day. She changed three different times while getting dressed even though she wore a sodding uniform, and as she sat in her classes, she found herself to be monumentally bored, a first. 

Visions of thick, veiny forearms and slender fingers touching her skin plagued her thoughts instead of arithmancy. She was aware she’d soon be sitting by him in Charms next period and was worried he’d know how badly her body begged for his lips or that she was consumed with naughty daydreams. 

She was nervous…extremely nervous, but every time his demanding and crude comments would pop in her mind, her legs would squeeze together and she’d release a frustrated sigh. His bright blonde head was caught over the crowd of students walking through the halls, and Hermione felt her heart speed up when she saw his large frame duck into the charms classroom. 

Walking into the classroom, she was half relieved to see Draco took to sit at the same desk, right in front of Theo and Lisa, and an empty chair next to him where Hermione now usually sat. 

His gray eyes flickered up to her, watching her movements with clear calculation and intrigue. She drew in a breath and lifted her chin straight, stepping to take her seat. Pulling her items out with almost too careful precision and a sharp awareness that he was watching her, Hermione continued to hold her breath until she situated herself in the chair. 

“Granger.” He calmly greeted.

“Malfoy.” 

“You’re wet.” 

Hermione froze and she slowly turned to face him. Her eyes rounded and her entire body flashed with an uncomfortable heat. Her chest started spasming and she was too embarrassed by his words to look around to see if anyone heard him. 

“What?” She whispered and Draco turned his head towards her. He looked over and observed her nervous face with an approving smirk. Looking down at her lips, then further down to her legs as he leaned in to whisper back. 

“Your robes Granger. There’s a wet stain on the front.” He commented and nodded to the spots of dark black on her robes. 

She followed his line of vision and looked down, seeing the wet spots he was referring to.

He meant those and not…not her. Draco enjoyed the way she fluffed her hair around her face to conceal her blooming cheeks. 

“Water must’ve splashed on me after I washed my hands in the loo.” She uttered. 

“Ah.” Draco said and opened his notes. “Mind somewhere else?” 

“No.” She adamantly said. 

“You sure? You seem…twitchy.” 

Hermione didn’t give him the benefit of giving him all the power. She boldly kept her face forward and decided to ignore him as best she could. He got off on being in control, knowing he could make her putty under his hands, so she’d just have to act as if her emotions weren’t in sexual overdrive. 

“No. I’m just excited for the day to be over.” 

Draco’s eyes darkened, a deep chuckle rising from his chest, the sound made her legs squeeze together tighter. 

“Why? Planning to blow off some steam?” He questioned, still eyeing her reactions. Her nostrils flared as she released a breath. 

“Perhaps.” She nonchalantly replied and Draco smirked at her false sense of confidence. She was nervous but too determined to prove herself for her own good. It was perfect. 

“Well whatever you plan on doing tonight, I do hope no one interrupts you. Otherwise I doubt you’ll get to enjoy your evening.” He commented briefly. Hermione caught on, knowing it was imperative to get to the dungeons unseen. She had the marauder’s map and could disillusion herself for added measure, ensuring no one would be aware of her adventure. 

“I’ll be fine. Thank you for your concern.” She said quickly. 

“Of course Granger.” He said just as Flitwick called for the class’ attention. Malfoy leaned over to whisper, the warmth of his breath fanning over her neck. “I wish you a most

pleasurable

evening.” 

Her thighs ached from holding them so stiff and she wished her bloody body would stop shivering any time his voice deepened. He was only a man after all, Malfoy at that. There’s no reason to be acting so randy. 

Hermione didn’t want to believe him when he told her they were compatible partners. It irritated her to agree with such a notion but even more to think he was correct in his assessment. They were just sexually attracted to each other and Hermione was certainly not what he thought of her. 

The time soon came for Hermione to trek over to the dungeons, telling Ginny and Neville she needed to stop in the prefect office to organize some reports for McGonagall. Her lie was easily bought and she waited another ten minutes before disillusioning herself and pulled out the map. 

She took her time, knowing that if she raced down to the Slytherin common room, the glimmer of the charm would catch someone’s eye and she’d be revealed. Narrowly missing Daphne, Blaise and Astoria as the walked away from the dungeons, Hermione took a breath and checked the map once more before confirming no one but Malfoy was in the common room.

Mumbling their password, the doors opened and she stepped through the threshold, shivering at the cool temperate underground. 

Malfoy was sitting against a window seat, the dark emerald greens of the Black Lake behind him. Just as she shut the door and ended the charm, he looked up from the book he was reading, a sultry grin coming over his lips. Hermione’s stomach twirled as she slowly walked over to him, attempting to conceal her shallow breathing and hide her nervousness. 

He rose from his cushioned seat, a calculating stare following her every step to him. Once she reached his place, she crossed her arms self-consciously and stood a couple paces in front of him. 

“Granger.” He calmly greeted, large hands stuffed into his trouser pockets. “I take it you found your way without anyone noticing you?” 

Hermione scoffed then rolled her eyes, shifting her weight onto one leg. She took in his appearance, still clad in Slytherin vest and uniform trousers.

“Do you honestly doubt me that much, Malfoy?” She questioned, watching as his eyes squinted down at her with a hint of mischievousness. 

“Not at all.” He began, his face never seeming to feature anything other than arrogance. “But I am curious to see how confident you are in your own abilities.” 

Hermione crinkled her brows. “I’m not sure I follow.” 

Draco looked thoughtful, his eyes raising to the ceiling as he began to contemplate something. 

“Would you say you’re focused enough to correctly cast those protective enforcements? You know, the ones you use for your girl gatherings.” He asked and Hermione felt a brief sense of worry come over her. This isn’t what she wanted to talk about. He promised her something in return for her discretion, she didn’t want to keep revealing their secrets. 

“Why do you want me to cast them?” She asked hesitantly. 

“Trust me Granger, you should do what I say. For both our sakes.” His voice sounded threatening but it still caused her center to quiver. Mercury colors swarmed his eyes along with the flares of green from the lake. Hermione sensed this wouldn’t be the only command he’d give her, and she almost wanted to see what would happen if she denied him. The thought made her oddly excited, but that would have to wait. 

Hermione blinked a few times, eyes falling over his body and around the common room before she swallowed tightly, tongue darted out to wet her lips and she released a breath through her nose. 

“Cast them over the whole common room?” She questioned, making Malfoy grin widely, showing his teeth shine before biting down on his lower lip. His hand came upwards, brushing some of her hair off her shoulder, exposing the skin on her neck. 

“Let's see if you can do this tiny little area. How about, from where you’re standing, to the window, yeah?” He challenged. 

Hermione’s brain was going off with alerts, trying to signal her that he was playing a dangerous game and it wasn’t a good idea for her to entertain him. Her body didn’t receive the warnings, instead, she took a step away from him and began casting the charms she’d use for the weekly meetings. Being confident in her abilities was one thing, but practicing magic felt like second nature, she had no reason to worry she wasn’t properly casting the wards. 

“Muffliato.” She finished the spells with a final silencing charm and tucked her wand away, turning her body around to find an intrigued looking Malfoy. He nodded approvingly at the bubble she made, then came to stand beside her. She turned to face him. 

“Now, you’re certain these are strong wards?” He asked, eyes brightening with something Hermione couldn’t put her finger on. 

“Yes?” She responded, her word coming out as an unintended question. Draco let out a half laugh. 

“Care to put it to the test?” 

Hermione’s mouth parted at his inquiry, nothing forming in her throat to make a coherent response so she blinked a few times and waited for him to continue. Draco’s fingers traced the skin on her neck before his hand encircled her throat. He leaned down to the ear, thumb caressing the bulge of her artery. She gasped slightly when his hand tightened its grip and when his lips connected with her ear. 

“Strip.” 

His simple command made her eyes shoot open, all the air in her lungs escaped and she harshly searched for his face for any sign of a joke. Draco stepped back away from her, sitting himself down on the window seat, leaning back against the thick glass, growing impatient already. 

“You think you’re so sure that your spells will hold up? Are you confident enough in yourself, Granger?” 

He was goading her, she knew it. He was trying to egg her on, get her rattled to the point that she would strip naked in the Slytherin common room just to prove a point to him that she was superior in spells and her abilities and that he didn’t intimidate her. 

“Or are you worried that your cries of pleasure will break the spell. Concerned that if I have you naked and spread like a whore that your wards will suddenly fail?” 

He continued, bringing the tip of his index finger into his mouth. He looked her up and down once, her fast breathing, her red face and wide glassy eyes. He huffed out a laugh. 

“Or maybe that’s what you want. To be found out? Should I just drop the spells right now—“

“No.” She squeaked, her voice thick with lust. Draco raised his eyebrows. “Don’t drop the enchantments.” 

Draco nodded once, but his lips curled into a sick smile. The annoying git was getting off on her nervousness. He waved his hand in the air, motioning for her to begin shucking off her clothes. 

“Lets go Granger. The sooner you strip, the sooner you’ll get what you came for.” 

Hermione inhaled deeply, battling with herself and trying to decide if she would really begin to remove her clothes. She was confident in her wards, but it still felt unnatural to be exposed. Looking over her shoulder then back to his waiting stare, she tilted her head down, shaky fingers moving to undo the zipper on her jumper.

“Ah, ah.” He interrupted and her syrup colored eyes snapped up to his. “Keep your eyes on me.” 

The command caused her stomach to flutter, the pulling sensations deep within her walls making her skin break out in gooseflesh.  Keeping her eyes on his, she slid down the zipper, the noise sounding offensively loud between them. Draco’s eyes flashed between her movements and her face. He slouched lower against the window, eyelids falling until he had to peer up at her. 

Hermione then pulled off her blouse, her face an almost painful heat. She hated the way his eyes lit up when he saw her bra. There was no reason she should have chosen this, opting for the dark blue bra with a wire underside but totally silk and lace for the cups. It made her look like she was trying and she didn’t want him to think that. She told herself she didn’t care that her stomach knotted when he licked his lips and she certainly didn’t care when his large hand palmed his erection. 

“Keep going.” He demanded, voice so low it vibrated through his lips. 

Hermione kicked off her trainers, removing her socks then sliding her jeans off her legs. Left alone in just her knickers and bra, she stopped, thinking this all he wanted, but Draco sat up straight and narrowed his eyes up at her. 

“You forgot some things.” His hand reached up, fingers plucking the fabric of her knickers before releasing it, causing it to snap against her hip. 

“Y-you want me—“

“Totally bare. Naked. Exposed. Yes Granger.” He confirmed with a smile, returning to his lax position against the window. “What’s wrong? Worried about being seen? Your wards will keep you safe for now, right?” 

She nodded to his words, goosebumps running all over her body despite the heat in her center. She couldn’t stop shivering, from his words, his gaze, his voice and her own nerves. Raising her hands behind her back, she unclasped the hook, the bra popped open and she slowly removed it off her arms. 

Draco watched the action with a hunger he’s never known. His cock was straining against his trousers, precum leaking through. Of course Gryffindor’s princess would have the most perfect pair of tits, accompanied by budding rose colored nipples. He thought of the lovely noises she’d make if he’d bite the taught skin and his cock jumped at the thought. 

Hermione took a final breath and removed her damp knickers, stepping out of them and stood completely bare and vulnerable in front of Malfoy. Much to her dismay, it was exhilarating and sent pulses to her sensitive and wet center. The cool air peaked her nipples and it even offered some relief  against her core. 

Malfoy sat up once more and her hands twitched at her sides, ready to grasp onto his shoulders and lower herself in his lap. She needed to be touched, he teased her all bloody week and she was fairly certain it wouldn’t take much for her to combust. 

“Turn around.” He said, gray eyes attached the smallest patch of curls at the top of her slit. 

Hermione rapidly blinked, not understanding why she would need to turn around but did it without a word. As soon as she faced the common room, her heart sped up, now realizing that fellow students could walk in any moment. It only added to the eroticism, she was naked and on display, at the will of Malfoy. 

His hands reached for her hips, bringing her backwards until she sat down on the edge of the seat, Draco’s erection pressed into her low back. His hands slid down her thighs, cupping under her knees and bringing them over his own legs. She was quite literally spread open, the cool air of the underground making her shudder against him. 

“There.” He said appreciatively. “Just the way I want you.” 

Leaning her back against him, she didn’t feel her body relax until his soft lips began placing open kisses against her neck. She slouched, relaxing her neck until she was almost completely slack. The way his body crowded over hers made her feel a strange sense of protection. He huddled her so closely to him there wasn’t any option for her to move unless he moved too, she was reliant on him.

“You kept our secrets, such a good girl you are Granger.” He mumbled into her skin, licking  a stripe up her jawline. Her mind was blurry, her hips began rocking, searching for something to fill her. His hands were still massaging up and down her thighs, Hermione’s own hands coming onto of his, following his movements. 

“And you’ve been so patient, I think you deserve something don’t you?” He asked her with a light voice, one hand skimming across her stomach, causing the muscles to spasm. 

“Yes.” She whispered, dazed by the feeling on his fingers tracing on her navel. His other hand floated up to her chest, groping her breast and making her moan into the air. 

“Tell me how much you want it.” He growled into her ear while pinching her nipple. Hermione squirmed into him, hips trying to move back into his hard cock and fingers. She mewled desperately, not wanting to wait any longer. 

“Malfoy, please.” She tried taking his hand and pushing it downwards to her soaking slit, but it was useless against his strength. 

“Tell me and I’ll give you exactly what you need.” He said lowly, the vibrations of his chest rumbling through hers. He pinched her nipple again while harshly biting into the skin on her collarbone, she cried out. 

“Fuck, please. I w-want it so bad, please.” She gasped, eyes rolling into her head. 

“I want to hear more.” He ordered, lapping up her soft skin. 

“I-I…” She swallowed thickly, “I need you to touch me, I need your fingers in me, please.” 

As she finished the quiet hiss of her plea, Malfoy’s right hand floated down her mound, two fingers circling her clit with tight pressure, she jerked against the feeling. He didn’t wait long before inserting two fingers with ease, making her back arch off him as she struggled to breathe, finally being given the delicious stretch she craved all week.

“Oh shit.” She groaned, head rolling forwards. Malfoy’s other hand reached up for her neck, forcing her body back into his. 

“Is this what you were waiting for, hm? Waiting for me to fuck you with my fingers?” 

Hermione arched again, pushing her arse back into him and making him moan at the friction. She briefly opened her eyes, looking down to where his fingers were quickly thrusting into her. 

Her body froze as she heard the large doors open and the sixth years suddenly entered the common room. Panicking with fear, she tried to squirm away from Draco’s hold. 

“Let..me…go. There’s—ugh!” She tried to wiggle out, but his strength was overpowering. His hand around her throat tightened, forcing her head still so he could whisper. 

“They have no idea what we’re up to. See?” He nodded to the group as they hung around the room for a few seconds, chatting amongst themselves, oblivious to the naked woman with her legs spread open as she allowed the man she once despised most to get her off. 

“Guess your spells worked.” He said as he nipped at her ear, a shudder running through her chest as he did. “We’re not alone anymore, do you like that? Do you like being naked like this, while others are completely unaware you’re ready to come for me?” 

Reveling in the feel of his hot breath blowing into her ear, Hermione ground her hips up into his hands, hoping it would count as an answer. 

“Oh yes you do. And you like my fingers inside you. I can feel your cunt clench around me. I bet you’d squeeze my cock so fucking tight.” 

His hand left her neck, finding her clit as his other continued to thrust into her. The combination of his slender fingers just touching her g spot and the pressure on her clit was driving her off the edge. She cried out, fisting his thighs and throwing her head back.

“I know you’re close. You’ve waited so long. Being so good for me. Do you like being a good slut for me, Hermione?” He sweetly asked, kissing alongside her jaw with harsh nips, his fingers on her clit going faster and faster while giving her just enough pressure. 

“Fuck, Malfoy. Keep—I’m almost—there,

oh.”

His fingers hit her g spot, shallowing their movements so he brushed it quicker and she could feel her center begin to uncoil.

Tell me you like being my slut.” 

“God fucking damm—“

“Do it and I’ll give you everything.” He growled, stopping his movements on her throbbing clit . Hermione couldn’t argue with a deal that sounded like heaven and sin. She was on the precipice of losing her mind, she needed to come and she needed

to bring her there. She was too sensitive to fight him, too needy to ignore him.

“I—

fuck yes

—like being your slut.” 

As her words spilled out from her mouth, Malfoy groaned and sucked harshly on her neck, his fingers in her cunt worked her drenched walls and he felt her clit swell. 

She felt tingles race through her toes and up her thighs, trying to clench them together to get every ounce of pleasure but Draco’s own legs wouldn’t allow it. He kept her spread and on display.

“Give it to me, be a good fucking slut and come on my fingers, that’s it Granger, fuck, yes.” 

Hermione felt suffocated, her chest was constricting, stomach flaming with heat and her cunt tightening and tightening with every deep pull of his fingers. She dug her head back on his chest and let her mouth fall open, a silent scream falling from her lips until it became loud and carnal moans. 

Ohhh! Yes, YES!”

Malfoy fastened his hold around her throat, feeling her chords vibrate with every passing wail. His eyes watched with bright glee as he quickly thrusted his fingers into her, her wetness glinting in the low lights of the room every time he removed them. 

While she whined and squirmed, Malfoy’s brain was heading into a frenzy. Draco quickly picked her up, heaving her body weight to shift on her knees then turned them so her naked body was pressed flush against the cool window. She moaned as her tits were pushed into the frigid glass. He grinded his hips hard into her arse, head titling back as he did so, eyes casting up to the ceiling. 

He shoved his trousers down, ripping the button off and brought his cock out, rubbing the head of it against her wet opening from behind. 

“I should fuck you against this window.” He groaned, a hand knotting into her curls, pressing into her head so he could speak directly into her ear. “Would you like that, hm? Fucked like a whore in the common room?” 

As he pushed the head of his cock into her slit, Hermione’s eyes shot open, gasps leaving her lips when she felt his thick head at her pulsing entrance. 

“I’d stretch you out so much you’d cry Granger. Can you handle that? Do you think you could handle me?” 

He pushed slightly, her walls still fluttering from her climax and softly moaned into the air when she tried pushing her hips back. When he realized what she was doing, he opened his eyes and let out a little laugh. 

“So eager for my cock.” He said, wrapping her curls around his fist and dragging them down so her head was facing the ceiling. “You’ll get in due time. You’re going to be begging for it.” He promised and the thought made her clench harder around the soft skin of his head. 

Draco indulged for a final second, the feel of her opening against him, before releasing her head and pulling them back. He tucked himself away and grabbed her hips again, falling backwards until his back hit the wall and she was straddling his hips. 

Draco kissed her hard and long, taking her soft bottom lip and slowly rubbing his tongue over it until she barely parted her mouth. Hermione thought his kiss was strange, it was softer, kinder from his aggressive words and fast actions. It was surreal to feel him be so gentle, she kind of enjoyed it, especially with the way her body still felt like a live grenade ready to explode all over again at the hard enough touch.

He rubbed his hands up and down her naked back, trading tongue touches with each other until they were both quietly moaning into their mouths. Hermione let her nails scratch over his neck and scalp, finding pride in knowing she was the reason he was whimpering into her mouth. 

After a minute or so, he pulled away and spoke in between kisses. 

“You’re so good, Granger…so good for me…perfect for this.” 

Her body felt weak in his arms and her mind felt more and more tired with every pressure point his hands were massaging in her back, shoulders and neck. 

“Get dressed and get some dinner.” He told her and she slowly opened her eyes, seeing the gray in his eyes look positively bright. Though his face was neutral, his eyes looked happy, content maybe? The expression felt allusive. 

He pushed them upwards and she began to remove herself from his lap as he began grabbing some of her clothes from the ground and placing them beside her. 

Awkwardly shuffling to her feet, her body faced him while she redressed but kept her eyes down. She wasn’t entirely sure how to have normal conversations with a man who she just told she enjoyed being his slut. It was unprecedented in her case. 

Draco pretended to situate his hair and his own clothes, scourgifying the cushions and reorganizing his book, but he was watching the witch from the corner of his eyes, sneaking a glance every so often while she adjusted herself. 

When she finally looked at him, she almost gasped seeing his stare already on her. The muscles in her throat bobbed and she prayed the next words out of her mouth were smooth. 

“Erm…thanks.” 

Jesus fucking Christ. Smooth. Absolutely perfect. 

Her face was as red as tomatoes and Draco’s face slowly broke out into a large smile, teeth and all.  It wasn’t until a little of his bottom row teeth showed that he let out a small chuckle. He stood up and towered over her, only leaving a small space between them. 

“Pleasure is all mine.” He quietly said, eyelids falling lower as he took in her body, no doubt imagining her naked form all over again. It was going to be in his mind until the next time he got his hands on her. 

She blushed hard and then stuttered out some nonsense.

“I should—head—I mean go to dinner. Yeah.” She took a step to break the ward but his arm caught her quickly. 

“I need to ask you something about your club.” He said suddenly and Hermione turned to look at him. 

“Um, okay.” She replied, worried about what else he knows. 

“Does Turpin actually like Theo? Or is that all part of yours’ little game?” 

The question was random, and it wasn’t really all that related to the club at all. She blinked once, partly confused why he would bother asking. He raised his eyebrows at her, waiting for a reply. 

“No, she likes him. Why does it matter?” She asked back. 

“Theo has plans to ask her to go steady. I wanted to make sure her feelings were reciprocated and try to warn him off if they weren’t.” He explained casually. 

Hermione felt her mouth open, shocked that Draco was looking out for his friend like that but found the quality to be rather sweet. 

“Lisa’s hoping Theo will ask her out. She really likes him.” 

Malfoy snorted then crossed his arms while inspecting a few first years returning to the common room. “They’re glued at the hip already, it’s disgusting.” 

“Just because you don’t have a heart doesn’t mean they’re disgusting. I think it’s sweet.” She joked, finding it out at how jovial she sounded rather than using her words in an insulting tone. It made Malfoy smirk. 

“Granger the romantic? Never would have guessed.” 

Hermione rolled her eyes and softly shook her head while picking the skin at her thumb. “No no. Not really. But seeing Lisa and Theo together is sort of lovely. They make an unlikely pair, don’t you think? They…balance each other.” 

Malfoy was quiet for a moment, analyzing her words with a crease between his brow and a smirk on his face. How could she be so oblivious? It’s exactly what he tried to tell her the other day in the fields, something she denied and here she was noticing it in another pair. 

“Right you are. But I still think their P.D.A is revolting.” He commented. 

“Not into hand holding, pecks on the cheek after class and walks into Hogsmeade?” She questioned with a light tone. Draco’s tongue darted out to dampen the bottom of his lip, Hermione’s eyes flashed to the movement and she knew she fucked up by doing so. His lips spread wide into a deep smile, his teeth glistening white and a small crease forming on his cheek. 

“More into secretive touches, the ones that take place under a desk, in a supply closet or in the hallways after curfew. The ones that if caught, would make the headmistress blush herself. You’re familiar with them aren’t you?” 

Draco’s voice was intentionally lowered, Hermione knew that, but it still caused her eyes to widen and her to swallow awkwardly. 

“Yes.” She answered quietly and averted his intense stare. He breathed through his nose, almost as if he was scoffing at her insecurity and unsureness, he’d have to work on that with her. There was no need to feel awkward after their meetings, but maybe it was just the way he made her feel. She was otherwise unbothered, so maybe it was truly just the way she was around him. The notion made his stomach leap and his cock twitch. 

“Go get dinner. I’m sure your friends will be prying into your business if you wait any longer.” He told her and she nodded in agreement. Without another word, she dropped the wards around them, then quickly left the common room. Draco sat down on the cushions, grinning like a madman at how well tonight has gone for him. 

Hermione walked to the Great Hall in a trance. Her legs were still wet with her residual arousal and orgasm, her thighs uncomfortable in her jeans. Acting as if nothing were out of the ordinary and praying her pussy didn’t overly smell, she took a seat next to Ginny, trying to pick up in conversation. 

“Oh hey. Get everything done?” Ginny asked while scooting over. 

“Yeah, I just needed to file some reports. What are you talking about?” She responded and looked at Padma. 

“We were planning some details for the Christmas party. We’ve drawn up maps from each common room for the best possible routes to go unseen by Filch and other teachers.” Padma explained. 

“Yeah and Hannah said she can get her hands on a few kegs of butterbeer, she has an in with someone in Hogsmeade.” Ginny added. 

“Brilliant. When are we going to start getting the word out?” Hermione asked, feeling her stomach growl. Supposed she is rather famished after such…exhausting activities.

“I think sometime late next week. Keep it hush hush for the time being so we decrease our chances of being found out.” Ginny said and Hermione nodded while devouring her cheesy soup and baguette. 

“Smart. Especially with some of the loudmouth boys around here.” Hermione commented.

Ginny and Padma giggled while agreeing. 

“True, the only boy who seems like he could keep a secret is Malfoy.” Padma off handedly said and Hermione felt her movements halt for a moment, spoon hovering just below her mouth as she peered at her friend. 

“What makes you say that?” Ginny questioned and Padma shrugged. 

“He hardly talks to anyone, seems bothered by almost everyone and I doubt he really cares about what we do in our final year.” She explained. “I think that just adds to his captivating behavior.” 

“Captivating? You think Malfoy is…captivating?” Hermione asked, wondering why her stomach began to knot. 

“Well yeah, don’t you? He’s quiet and brooding and gods did he grow over the last summer? Sheesh.” Padma shook her head as if to clear her own naughty thoughts away from the Slytherin. “I mean, come on Hermione, aren’t you spending some time with him here and there? You must see it?” 

“I—I don’t…know what you mean.” Hermione’s chest began to tug and suddenly it felt like she was becoming jealous that other girls had noticed Malfoy. That’s silly. She’s not jealous, just interested and confused in what Padma’s saying. 

“I mean his sulking behavior and keep away from me attitude… It's hot. It’s drawing girls in and he’s not even paying attention. Total madness. Makes me wonder what he’s like in the sack.” 

Ginny suddenly snorted out a laugh and clapped a hand over her face. Hermione started to scarf her food down, needing something in her mouth to prevent her from speaking.

“Gods Pad.” Ginny smiled. 

“What? I’m not the only one. Astoria and I had quite the discussion about his sexual preferences.” 

As Padma went off, Hermione’s eyes drifted to where Draco just entered the Great Hall. His uniform still on, hair tucked neatly into place and eyes vibrant with something that looked…priggish. Bastard. He wore his confidence well, she just wished it wouldn’t make her squirm so much. 

“We think he’d be quiet but moan and grunt loudly. Most likely one to grab you all over but only have you from behind that selfish little twat.” Padma giggled and Ginny rolled her eyes, but Hermione’s focus was entirely on him. “He’d probably be so consumed with his own pleasure, only giving after getting you know? No doubt it would be spectacular though. He used to walk around like he had the biggest cock ever made. I’m slightly jealous that Hermione drew his name to find out if it’s true.” 

As Draco sat down and greeted his friends, his gray eyes flashed up to hers. Hermione suddenly felt herself grin, realizing that she was now the only person who knew anything about Malfoy’s sexual preferences and it made her fill up with pride to know how wrong everyone’s assumptions were. Draco gave her an interesting look but returned the secretive grin. 

“What do you think Mione? Does he give you those vibes?” Ginny asked for her input. 

Her eyes snapped away and she plastered a convincing smile on her face while nodding. “Yes definitely.” 

She glanced one more time over at Malfoy, his head turned to the side but the same smug look on his face as if he knew she was watching him. He ran two fingers off the whipping cream on top of the dessert pudding and slowly put them in his mouth. The same fingers he used to get her off not a half hour ago. With a parted mouth and the denim of her jeans rubbing against her center, Hermione released a heavy breath and tried to ignore the cocky expression he wore for the remainder of dinner. 

“So when’s the Christmas Party?” 

Hermione jumped, unaware there was a new patron in the prefect office. She was making the calendar for January, taking into account all the necessary changes to accompany the prefects in the new year. Katie Bell and Anthony Goldstein were on rounds and she wanted to be done before they got back, not feeling like being overly social tonight, something that carried over from the weekend. 

But of course he would seek her out. It had been days since their meet up and Hermione spent the better part of her weekend trying to avoid him while also frequently excusing herself to her dorm or the bathroom when a memory of his hands holding her thighs apart popped into her mind. She was randy as hell and her center craved attention, something other than her own fingers. 

The problem was, she had no idea how to move forward, so she cowardly hid back, ignoring him in classes and around the castle as best she could. She was too embarrassed by her own need or her own mind’s crazed desire to admit how much she wanted him again. So she waited and waited, hoping that maybe her horniness would pass, but with each ending day and each second she denied herself away from him, the heat in her belly worsened. 

Hearing his voice in this moment only doused the fire. 

“Christmas party?” She asked as she turned around to face him, ignoring the fluttering in her chest. “How do you—we haven’t…” 

Draco smirked as she trailed off and made himself comfortable on the chair of the sofa, crossing his arms over his chest and giving her an amused look. 

“I know things, remember?” He shrugged to which she frowned. 

“Yes, but how do you know that? We aren’t telling anyone until next week?” Hermione wondered, setting down the parchment and putting away her quill. 

“I have my ways.” His ambiguity was vexing and Hermione wondered how much he really knew from their meetings, and more importantly, how he penetrated them. 

“How do you…do you know—“ She began but instantly stopped when she remembered Draco only hinted at knowing things after the meeting where she was first partnered with him. He was guessing in the library all those weeks ago, it wasn’t until recently where he asked more direct questions about things they discussed in their meetings. 

“Do I know…? Come on, out with it Granger.” He encouraged sarcastically, enjoying the look of confusion as she processed information in her head. She then shook her head, clearing away her nervousness that he knew the exact reason for the formation of their club. Standing from the desk and organizing her rucksack, she spoke. 

“Nothing. Nevermind. I’m heading out so you need to leave.” 

“But you haven’t answered my question.” He said, remaining on the couch. She stopped just in front of the desk and leaned her bum against the wood. Her eyes took him in; black jumper with the sleeves pushed up to his thick forearms and his silver necklace dangling on his chest, gray trousers tightening around his thighs from the position he was sitting in, eyes that seemed to annoyingly entrance her when paired with a subtle smile. 

She sighed deeply and rolled her head from one shoulder to the other. “Next week Thursday. Hufflepuff common room but I’m sure you already knew that.” 

“Didn’t know the date.” He grinned then stood up. “Why haven’t you ladies told anyone about it yet?”

“We don’t want any loud mouths to spread word and have the night cancelled before it even starts. Keeping it under wraps and on a need-to-know only for the time being.” She explained to which he nodded thoughtfully. “Hopefully you can keep a tight lid on it then. Would be a shame if the information was passed and the party gets cancelled.” Hermione said, hands tightening around her rucksack. 

“I have no plans of spoiling the fun. I won’t even be going.” He admitted with a bored expression. Hermione tilted her head, shocked that he would skip out on the night, especially when all of his friends would most likely be attending.

“Why, worried you won’t find a date?” She joked honestly, 

“No. I’ll be doing something far more interesting that evening.” He told her, voice dripping with innuendo. Hermione decided to bite. 

“And what will that be?” 

Malfoy felt his skin vibrate with excitement. It was the exact question he wanted her to ask, and he knew she was too intrigued to ignore him. He loved the way her body responded to his touch, getting off on the way her cunt would drip from his words. He was the only one that could do it and the way they’ve kept this secret made it all the more addicting. 

“I’m planning on fucking you until you scream my name.” 

His blunt statement and arrogant smile caused Hermione to gasp. A wave of pleasure flushed down her stomach and in between her legs. Feeling herself outwardly lose composure, she blinked rapidly and took a breath. 

“That won’t be happening. I’ll be attending the party to spend time with my friends.” She argued weakly, her voice hitching as he began to walk towards her. 

“Oh yeah?” He mocked. 

“Yes.” She tried to clearly state, wishing her body was fuming with heat as he stalked closer. 

“No, I don’t think so, Granger.” He started and she pressed the back of her thighs further into the wood of the desk when he stood toe to toe with her. “You’re going to make an appearance at the party, claim you don’t feel well, then come to my room after, okay?” 

She narrowed her eyes, some of her resolve coming back to her. 

“Not happening.” 

“We’ll see.” 

“No we won’t. I’m not some…robotic bimbo that does whatever you say.” She argued, holding his eye contact, but he just seemed to enjoy her words. 

“I never said that. I just told you what will happen because it inevitably

will happen

because

want it to happen.” He cockily stated. 

“That’s just…ridiculous to make assumptions about me again. You have no idea what I want.” Hermione wished he stepped back, but he didn’t. He tilted his head, a stray bang of blonde hair falling down his forehead. 

“I know exactly what you want and you know I’m the only one that’s able to give it to you.” 

Hermione opened her mouth to bite back but no words came out as a flash of him pressing her hard dick into her bum with her naked body pushed up against a window came into her mind. She looked into the pools of gray swirling clouds in his eyes and accidentally let her gaze fall to his mouth. He had her.

“I can even leave you something to think about then. Help make up your mind before you ultimately decide before next week, sound okay?” He prodded, his chest feeling the rise of her breasts from every inhale and exhale. He could smell her airy perfume, the kind that use to bug the fuck out of him but now it makes his cock twitch. A scent of flowers mixed with ink, something specific to her that drove his pheromones wild. 

Hermione wasn’t sure if his question was rhetorical but she meekly answered him anyway. 

“I guess.” She blinked down to his mouth then quickly up to his eyes. Why did it always feel like he was teasing her and why did it make her knees weak and center throb?

They stared at each other, eyes widening, lips parting and faces moving towards each other. 

“When are Goldstein and Bell due back?” He breathed across her lips, making her eyelids flutter shut. His breath always had its own warming aroma, a taste of mint laced with something sweet and addicting. 

“They should return in fifteen minutes.” She responded softly, lips just seconds away from each other. 

“I only need ten to make you come.” He smirked,  eyes focused on the way her tongue just brushed under her top lip. Her eyes seemed to widen at his words, her breath halting midway through her chest. He looked down at her body then back up to her shutting eyes. “Take off your clothes…then sit on the desk.”

Her mind stopped working, a scene of her naked and spread on a desk while he fingered her and whispered dirty things into her ear sent a quivering sensation directly to her cunt. Biting the corner of her tongue, she accidentally shivered, Draco’s gaze becoming heavy with lust. 

“I…there’s…no we can’t.” She finally said after stuttering. The rhythm of the heart was beating so loud it was echoing in her head. 

“Why not? Scared of being caught?” His tone was teasing and his fingers reached up to twirl a loose curl. He gently tugged on it. “I thought you liked that Granger. You certainly did last time.” 

She faltered, because she certainly did. Unable to answer him, she let his hands reach down to the fabric of her shirt with astounding patience and earthquaking anticipation.

“If you want me to stop…” He said, hands reaching down under her shirt, beginning to scrunch the material upwards. “All you have to do is say so.” He leaned his head down by her ear, running his cheek over the curve of it and pushed her shirt over the top of her bra. 

Hermione didn’t stop him. She took a deep breath and leaned back to cross her arms over her chest, removing her shirt and letting it fall to the ground. When she looked back up, Draco wore a shit eating grin, so she rolled her eyes at him. 

“Shut up. You have ten minutes.” She said then grabbed his neck to bring his mouth onto hers. She muffled the amused noise coming from him with her lips, her tongue seeking his out and sighing when it wove with hers. Draco, though very pleased by her willingness, needed her to understand he was still the one in control. 

“Remove all your clothes. I won't touch you until you do.” He said breathlessly, hands frozen at the warm and soft flesh of her sides. 

Hermione pulled back, her lips giving a loud smack. She gave him an annoyed look. 

“Why does it matter if I do it?” 

His lips were shining with her saliva, cheeks flushed and gray eyes becoming black. Draco slowly leaned his head down and placed a delicate kiss on her ear, blowing air down her sensitive skin. 

“When you do what I want.” He muttered darkly, fingers fighting on her hips. 

“When you follow my orders.” His teeth bit at her neck, causing her to release a loud sigh. 

“When you trust me with your body.” Hermione gasped when his tongue licked down her shoulder and to the swell of her breast.

“It gets me off.” He admitted and Hermione’s jaw went slack when he bit into her breast. “And it makes me want to please you more when you listen.” 

Draco lifted his head back up to hers and suddenly looked feral. Her insides clenched “So do what I say and get naked then sit your arse on the desk and spread your legs. We only have eight minutes now.” 

There are moments when Hermione knew when to open her mouth and when she should keep it shut and this was certainly an instance for her to keep quiet. She hastily unbuttoned her trousers, pulling them down with her knickers and kicking off her shoes. She reached for him and collided their lips into a frantic kiss, using one hand to undo her bra. When it broke free, his hands finally roamed over her skin, pinching her nipples, kneading her breasts, groping her arse and grinding his erection into her stomach. 

His fingers pushed at her hips, gripping the skin to get her to sit on the desk. Once seated, he swiftly opened her legs, causing a gasp to leave her mouth as he sucked on her tongue. Skimming his hands up her thighs, Hermione excitedly awaited for the first relieving touch he’d offer her. Two of his fingers swept down her slit and he sucked in a breath then let out a disbelieving chuckle. 

“You’re drenched Granger,” He whispered into her neck, licking at the skin. “Being bare like this, whoring yourself for me, feels good doesn’t it?” 

She refused to say anything, instead she focused on the way his fingers ran over her slit and rubbed her clit. She learned that he didn’t always need her verbal response but the physical one her body gave him was more than enough. And even if she couldn’t say it out loud sometimes, she did like it. She liked how inhibited she felt when he touched her and commanded her to do things. It was an odd sense of power she gave him over her, but he had yet to use it against her, instead only ever focusing on her pleasure. 

His lips trailed down her chest, one hand grasping at her breast while his teeth latched onto a perk nipple. She hissed and pushed her chest and hips into his touch. 

He slowly entered her wet cunt with one finger while teasing the skin of her exposed breasts with his tongue. There was a path of his salvia beginning on her collarbone and forming over her tits where he licked and bit the pink flesh. Her skin was already blushing with a small layer of sweat, but he was going much too slow if they didn’t want to be caught.

“Malfoy,” She whined. “More.” 

He darkly chuckled, harshly biting her nipple before thrusting another finger into her. 

“You want more? More than this?” 

She moaned loudly, uncaring if Anthony and Katie were almost done with their rounds and close to walking in on them. She was blinded, only comprehending him and his words. 

He grabbed one of her hands and placed it over his erection, Hermione’s eyes flew open and Draco smiled down at the reaction. 

“You want this? You want me to stretch your cunt out? Do you think I could fit myself into you?” He snarled and she tightened her grip around him, delicately running her hand down his clothed shaft and trying to get a sense at how big he really was…and fuck…he was big.

“Or maybe we should see how well you put your mouth to use, eh?” He let go of her hand and snatched some of her hair in his grip. The pain at her scalp was soothed instantly when his fingers brushed against her g-spot. 

“Does that get you wet Granger? Do you wanna choke on my cock? Do you get off on the thought of swallowing me?” 

She didn’t mean to moan, but when his fingers kept brushing into her sensitive wall and his lips were mumbling dark fantasies into her own, she had no other option. Everything he was saying was something she wanted to do. 

“I think you’d be so good at taking me. I think you’d want to prove to me how dirty you can get,  want to show me what a good fucking slut you are for my cock.” 

Hermione’s eyes rolled into her head, the thrusts of his digits becoming shallow, giving her the exact movement she needed to come. 

“Say it Hermione.” He ordered. “Tell me what you want.” 

Her hips mercilessly bucked into his touch, the fire in her stomach beginning to roll throughout her body. His lips enclosed over her nipple and the hand he had in her hair yanked her neck back, exposing her neck to him. He wasted no time and harshly bit down on her skin, teeth scraping to make speckles of blood rise to the surface. It felt so good, the pain and pleasure he was giving her. 

“I want your cock.” She groaned and Malfoy removed his fingers from her dripping cunt then slapped down on her clit before entering her. She cried out loud and the sound of her wails caused his smirk to deepen. God she was so good for him.

“Where do you want it?” He growled. 

“In me, oh fuck—please!” She sobbed, her own hand rubbing him vigorously through his pants, she squeezed him at his base and Draco’s legs felt weak for a moment.

“In your mouth? You want me to hold you face and fuck your mouth, hm? Does my little slut want that?” He groaned as he inserted a third and final finger into her. The stretch felt so good, uncomfortable just a tad until the spongy wall was hit once more. 

“Or do you want my cock in that wet cunt? Huh Hermione, tell me?” 

There were tears in her eyes, her scalp was on fire and her chest was tightening with the lack of fresh air. She was suffocated by the scent of his sweat and breath, feeling herself on the brink of release. 

“Yes, gods yes!” 

“Whose cock do you want to fill you?” He demanded, fingers pushing into her deeper and deeper, right there, yes right…there.

“Yours!” 

“Who’s Hermione? Say my name.” He slapped her clit again, her legs shook and her walls tightened around his fingers as soon as he pushed them back into her.

“Yours, Draco! Give me—oh fuck yes, Draco!” 

As soon as she spoke his name, her vision blurred white dots of black and she felt her body go slack. Her hips rolled into his hand, her mouth hung open in a silent scream and her eyes were so tightly clamped there was a small muscle twitching between her brow. Malfoy bent her head back further and dipped his tongue into her mouth, bumping her with every slow kiss he gave. His fingers still stroked her until she was a shuddering and whimpering mess. 

Her hand was still firmly placed on his dick, but she stopped her movements and just held him through his pants. Realizing herself, she pulled back and rested her hand behind her. Malfoy ended their kiss and bent before her, spreading her legs out wider than before running his tongue up and down her cunt. 

“Ah! M-malfoy, I’m t-too sensitive.” She jolted, one hand winding in his hair to pull him off but he kept going. 

“I just want a taste, Granger, fight through it.” 

She whimpered and hissed, her clit almost throbbing with pain from her intense orgasm and the way he lapped at her juices. He sucked on it hard, making her thighs come shut around his shoulders, but he pried them open, large palms pinning her tight to the desk. His tongue was relentless and Hermione needed it to end, her whole body was vibrating and she needed to catch her breath. 

“Please.” She quietly sobbed, sighing as he finally removed his mouth from her and stood up. Peeling her eyes open, she saw his infamous grin and his lips slick with her arousal. He licked his lips, and then his fingers, before leaning down and capturing her mouth, letting her taste herself. He groaned lightly and brought his hands up to her cheeks, holding her face and turning their heavy snog into light pecks and sweet touches. Her body was returning to normal with his careful actions.

“I’ll stall Katie and Goldstein. You should have at least five minutes to dress.” He told her, thumbs rubbing her cheekbones. Hermione took a deep breath and nodded. They both pulled away, Draco helped her to her feet while reaching down for some of her clothes. She took them and quietly thanked him, fumbling with the shirt as she did. 

Draco observed for a second as he dropped her hand and took a step back. Her hair was a tangled mess and her chest was a stinging pink from the assault from his mouth. Her lips were swollen and forehead glistening with sweat. He thought she looked bloody attractive and a happy thought came to his mind when he realized that he was definitely the only one to have her begging for him. He was the only one she allowed to speak to in that way, the only one she trusted to push her boundaries with and to care for her body. It made him feel oddly proud and the thought made a genuine smile form over his lips. 

“Do you feel good?” He asked and her eyes snapped up to his as she arranged her bra to sit correctly against her chest. The question sounded like something of insecurity, but Draco was more so curious to what her actual answer would be, especially when she wasn’t moaning with pleasure. 

“Huh?” She replied and quickly pulled up her knickers. 

“When we do this, do you.. feel good?” 

Hermione gave him a strange look as she continued dressing. She wanted to laugh at him, considering he was the one who was giving her orgasms and the one she thought about to get herself off. She felt good, great even, but his calm question led her to believe that maybe he meant more than just physically. She thinks he meant…if she was okay with what they’re doing and maybe okay that it was him. 

“Yeah…yeah I feel good. I’m…good.” She nodded slowly, tucking her arms into her jumper. 

“Yeah?” Malfoy echoed.

“Yes.” She reaffirmed with a knowing smile. He reflected it, his stare clinging on to all the different shades of brown, caramel and umber in her eyes. She looked around the classroom, fighting off a giggle. “I thought you were going to hold off Katie and Anthony? I think it’d look a tad racy for them to find us while my pants are still down.” 

Malfoy chuckled and took another step back, beginning to turn his body away from her. 

“I am. I’ll be on my way, with,” he checked the clock behind her, “approximately three minutes to spare.” 

His mouth curved upwards before he turned and left her alone in the office to dress.

He did it again. He somehow made her…submissive. 

What the bloody hell was wrong with her? It’s not as if he was forcing her, but every time his deep voice whispered her an order, she complied mechanically. He was so good, so talented with his fucking hands. Gods those perfect, strong, thick hands. 

Enough was enough. And while the intense orgasms she had from him were some of the best of her life, she had reached a point where she wasn’t going to let him get access to her unless she got the same. 

There was a job to do after all and it was time to stop jagging around and finish what she started, not only for herself but for her friends and the pact they made. 

The weekend presented the perfect opportunity. Coming to Daphne and inquiring about his whereabouts, Hermione boldly told her she was going to attempt to make a move. Daphne, impressed, and one to live for the drama,  enthusiastically disclosed that Draco snuck away that morning to fly around the quidditch pitch. Hermione thought it was odd he wanted to fly while the December weather was frigid and unforgiving, but nonetheless, she quickly dressed then stalked outside. 

The late morning of Saturday was a swirl of dull blues and bright whites. There was a small dusting of snow that was already crunching into ice and the sun was painfully vibrant through the gray clouds. She stretched her hand over her eyes, shadowing her view so she could locate him in the air. She approached the edge of the pitch, seeing his blurry figure swirl up and up and in circles, seemingly chasing an invisible snitch. 

As he came swooping down, body floating midair, she could faintly make out his head tilted down and waved with the hand covering her eyes. Draco squinted his eyes downwards, faintly smiling to himself then watched as she mysteriously walked away from the grounds and towards the tented locker rooms. He lowered himself closer to the ground, hovering only about ten meters up. She turned to look at him over her shoulder, raising her mouth in a half smile then facing forward once more and continuing on her walk.

What was the witch up to? Finding himself fascinated by her sudden appearance and now retreat, he slowly lowered himself off his broom and followed her on a path to the changing rooms. He was panting from the cool air, every inhale was sharp in his chest and burned his throat. He was eager to conceal his body away from the weather, and the giddy feeling he got in his stomach when she smirked at him was enough to let him know maybe she was seeking the same thing. 

As she disappeared into the tent, Malfoy’s pace increased to a fast walk. Priding himself on his usual attentiveness and patience for an opportunity strike, today was a time where all of it was forgotten. His wild imagination was flipping with excitement and later, he would feel slightly embarrassed for how little she had to do to get him to blindly follow her. 

Pushing past the folded doors, Malfoy was met with the back of Granger’s head, her sitting on one of the benches facing the board where they would review plays and defenses. She looked impossibly still, the only sign of her moving was the tap of her pointer finger against the bench as she pondered the exes and oh’s and their significance. 

Malfoy sat next to her, the creak of the wooden bench crying as he rested his weight. She didn’t move immediately, rather her eyes stayed focused in front and her finger continued its rhythmic movements. 

“Granger. Didn’t think I’d be joined on the pitch this morning. Care for a lesson?” 

His joke made her finally move. Wood whined as she shifted to face him, her brown eyes looking cunning and crafty, patterned with something….intentionally seductive. 

“Not here for a lesson Malfoy.” She sweetly began while raising the tapping finger and placing her hand on his thigh. He didn’t intend to flinch from the feeling, but she also had never initiated contact between them. He was the master of the game, the one who touched and guided. His eyes flashed down to her hand and back up to her dark eyes. 

“What are you here for then?” He questioned, licking his lower lip. She moved again, leaning forward so her hand pressure increased. Her palm was so tiny, barely made it around the top of his thigh, and the way it was so near to his center region made blood quickly flow down there. 

“I came to tell you that you’re right.” She spoke in a sultry tone. Draco couldn’t even revel in her words, too preoccupied with the heat of her palm encroaching up his thigh. 

“About what?” He asked, eyes lowering to her smirk. 

“You’re right about me. I am submissive…to you at least.” 

Hermione leaned her face down to his neck, planting a very loud and wet kiss just under his jaw. He tilted his head back, blood pumping wildly to his cock as her other hand reached just above his abdomen. 

“Oh?” He choked out, his hands grasping out to her thick curls and thigh, wanting her closer. 

“Mhm.” She confirmed while kissing down his neck, lightly sucking at the skin. She took a hold of the material of his trousers, pulling upwards and standing, leading him with her. Her hands roamed under his sweaty jumper, nails scratching down his cool muscular stomach. “And I like the way you make me feel.” 

Malfoy felt his fingertips spark with the urge to rip her clothes off, but he liked listening to her breathy speech while shamelessly touching him. Normally he didn’t appreciate a girl being overly attentive to him. He enjoyed the prying, the playing innocent and hard to get, but he certainly didn’t mind when Granger was the one doing it. 

“Yeah?” He grinned as she pushed him backwards, his back gently hitting the blackboard. Hermione reciprocated his grin and tilted her head down then peered back up at him with a very serious expression. 

“Yes. I like the way your fingers feel inside me when I come.” She muttered, looking up at him from under her eyelids, eyes flashing to his parted mouth. 

“Oh fu—“ Malfoy said and grabbed her neck and brought her body tight against his. Hermione pushed back though, fingers ghosting down to his hips and mouth licking up to his ear. 

“And I liked the way your tongue kissed my clit. It felt so good. You felt so good.” She whispered into his ear, the heat and dampness of her mouth sending a shiver down his spine. Her voice was so soft and tantalizing. He wanted so badly to continue hearing her dirty words. 

“Tell me more. Have you touched yourself?” He gruffly asked, vision becoming blurry as she nipped at his ear and took off her coat. 

“Everyday. Sometimes twice a day since that time in the common room.” She admitted and Draco hissed when she bit down on his skin. 

“Witch.” He groaned, her hands running along the elastic seam of his sport trousers, absolutely tormenting him. 

“I think of your voice, the things you say to me, the way you touch me. And then I come on my fingers, whispering your name Draco.” She continued, hands barely brushing over his erection. “It’s not enough though, I need so much more. I need you.” 

“Fuck, I’ll give it to you. I’ll give you everything.” He told her, his hands aching to touch her everywhere. 

The light touch of her hands was gone and Draco had to focus his sight to watch her next action. Hermione removed her shirt, leaving her in a dainty looking bra, mauve nipples poking through the material. Draco was panting, sweat forming on his brow and they hadn’t kissed properly yet. She stepped back to him, her hands pushing up his shirt and happily removed it, needing to feel his hot flesh. 

He greedily grabbed her body, having enough of her teasing words. He landed on her mouth with a fire that was spreading across a dry field, consuming everything in its path. Hearing her delicate moan when he thrusted his tongue into hers made him pin her hips to his, letting her feel every inch of his hard cock. 

“Wanna know what else I realized?” She asked through a pant, head tilting to the side as his teeth assaulted her skin. 

“Hm?” He grunted, fingers slipping past the denim over her bum. She smiled, one hand reaching down to palm his erection the other hand pulling his hair. 

“I may enjoy being submissive.” She huffed, squeezing his cock through the material and Draco moaned as she brought his forehead up to rest on hers. “But I like being Hermione more. And do you want to know something about me?” 

Draco peeled his eyes to look into her dark brown ones, seeing the sexiest look she’s ever given him before. It was like a dream, a dirty, wet dream to have Granger half naked, grabbing his dick and looking at him like that. He badly wanted to stare at her like this for hours. 

“Tell me.” He said, trying to duck down and kiss her plumped lips. 

“I’m determined…some would even say…relentless…to get the things I want. You know what I want right now?” As she spoke, her fingers grazed beneath his trousers, nails scratching the small patches of hair by his navel. His stomach clenched and his thighs shook.

“Hm?” He aksed, half-coherent.

“I want to taste your cock and please you.” 

She bent down to her knees and slowly sank his trousers down. Draco almost fell over, leaning against the board and watched, with his mouth watering, as she came face to face with his protruding erection barely covered by his briefs. 

Hermione’s plan had been working so well, she didn’t actually think he would let her touch him like this. Hesitation would not be permissible, so she bravely leaned forward and kissed his stomach and pulled down his briefs, feeling his erection spring straight and rest under her chin.  She continued placing wet kisses down his navel, finally taking grab of the velvet like rod with one hand. Hermione gasped and pulled back. 

He was impossibly thick, and fuck, so long. His shaft extended way off his body in a creamy milk color that was accompanied by a deep cherry colored tip. She could easily fit both her hands around him with enough room to put him in her entire mouth as well. 

Fucking hell. He was fucking massive.

While she gazed, Draco couldn’t help but feel arrogant at her current gaping. He tried to warn her, even told her, but apparently she didn’t take him seriously. So when he brushed back some of her hair and she looked up at him with round, apprehensive eyes, she grinned down at her like a cat. 

“Like what you see?” 

She wanted to roll her eyes at him, shove him away and tell him cockiness was not an attractive quality especially when his cock was inches away from her mouth. But instead, the smirk he wore was taken as a challenge, and her need for self satisfaction would not be deterred. 

She stared up at him, experimentally sticking her tongue out and licking the slit on his head, collecting the salty and bitter precum forming there. His jaw hung open, a desperate groan tearing through his throat. She smiled at the reaction and jerked an eyebrow up at him. 

“Like what

see?” She condescendingly said then popped his thick head into her mouth, swirling her tongue around him. The baritone moan then fell from his mouth sparked a twitch in her clit. 

She released her jaw and opened her mouth wider, encasing her lips over more of his cock and running her tongue under him before completely pulling off of him. Panting already, she brought her two hands around him in tandem, trying her best to spread her salvia. 

“Fuck yes, just like that.” He encouraged.

Gathering a breath to push him in farther, Hermione slowly jerked his cock and pulled him deeper into her mouth, only fitting about half of him in before he uncomfortably hit her throat. 

“Gods fucking shit.” He groaned above her, head casted upwards and eyebrows furrowing together. One hand quickly came to the back of her head, not pushing her, but fingers needing something to hold onto while his thighs tightened. He took his other hand and tried to grasp the board behind him. 

She pulled back once more, collecting spit on her tongue and running it down him and all around the base, being sure to heavily pant on the sensitive flesh so he would lose control faster. Taking him into her mouth once more, she began twisting her fists around him and moving them up and down, the way Parvati and Daphne once explained was the best way to give a blowie. 

It seemed to work because Draco suddenly bucked into her mouth, causing her throat to close around him and tears to shoot to her eyes. 

“Fuck Granger. So fucking…how are you…so good at this? So good at taking my cock,

shit.

” His hold around her curls tightened, lightly pulling her off him so she could breathe once more. Her jaw hurt and she didn’t think she was doing that great of a job, but he still moaned and cursed like it was the best thing ever done to him. 

“Fucking take it, gods, yeah. Just like that, oh fuck Granger.” 

She sucked harder, willing herself to take him deeper into her mouth without gagging, but fuck, he took up all room in her mouth, hardly fitting into the space as is. Using her hands to advantage, she continued to twist and stroke, quickening the pace and the licks of her tongue. 

“So good, a fucking cockslut is what you are. Just for me.” 

She accidentally moaned around him, squeezing her legs together as she kneeled before him. His head fell onto his chest and he smirked at her, seeing her lips over him, trying her hardest to take more of him in, gentle hands jerking him into her mouth while his hand was in her untamed hair. She was making wet noises around him, spit running down him and her hands, she tightened her hold. It was one of the hottest fucking things he’s ever seen. 

“Fuck Granger…I’m so close. Let me…I want to taste you.” 

He tried to reach down to pull her head off of him, wanting the opportunity to satisfy her, but as his hands came on her head, she quickly took  hold of his wrists and yanked them off her, pinning them to the board and off her body. Draco, surprised by the motion, found it entirely too arousing and bucked into her mouth again. Tears fell from her cheek and she gagged around him, her spit falling onto him as she tried to work him to his end with just her mouth. 

“Granger…stop..I’m gonna…I—I” Draco shut his eyes, feeling his balls tighten and stomach flood with heat.  She squeezed his wrists as he tried to flex his arms out of her hold, he was going nowhere. 

“Fuck…fuck I’m…I’m—Oh FUCK!” 

He grunted loudly and shot a thick stream of come into her mouth. Hermione choked a bit, but it was drowned out by his moans and slightly thrusting of his hips. She slowed her movements down, feeling the veins around his cock pulse and constrict as the liquid filled her mouth. Harshly breathing through her nose, she released his wrists and brought one hand around him, pumping the last of her climax onto her tongue. 

Being brave and taking one more breath, she swallowed the load, surprised by how much there was but also that it tasted slightly bitter but really nothing at all. She heard Daphne complain about how it can sometimes taste like sweat and expired milk, but this wasn’t anything like that.

Draco felt his ears ringing, sweat falling down the center of his back as she pulled her mouth away with a souping sound. He reached down for her arms and pulled her to her feet, not giving her a chance to tug away before capturing her lips. 

Her hands were still slick with spit and she tried to discreetly wipe them on her bottoms, but Draco grabbed her arms and threw them behind his neck, ushering her hands into his hair. He sighed and held onto her chin, letting her lips guide their kiss. One of his palms was splayed across her bum, not grabbing but rather resting, keeping her close. 

He kissed so intensely, whether it be hard and fast, desperate and noisy, or uncharacteristically timing and shy, peppering soft kisses on her lips until she felt tired. 

“Take this off for me.” He whispered, lips fumbling over hers as he lowered the strap of her bra off her shoulder. 

She pulled back, letting her hands slide down bare his chest and softly brush over the bumps of his abs. 

“I don’t—I mean.” She shook her head, letting her hands fall to her sides as she tried to escape his gentle hold. “That was for you. I don’t need anything in return.” 

She looked elsewhere as he reached down to pull his trousers back up, blushing as she saw that even soft he was rather large. So he was…gods what did Ginny call it? A show-er and a grower? 

Once tucked away, he stepped forward, hands grabbing her by the arse and pulling her back into him. He nudged her head to the side and ran his tongue up her neck, blowing on the wet area and happily watching the bumps rise to the surface on her skin. 

“I still want to make you come.” He nuzzled his lips right by her ear, making Hermione’s eyes flutter and stomach twitch with delight at the sensation and words. 

“N-not necessary.” She placed her hands on his pectorals, the skin a sweltering heat. 

“I think it’s only fair, especially with the way you took me in your mouth. It was so nice being inside you. Makes me want to return the favor, flatten my tongue against you until I feel you come.” 

Hermione felt her strength loosen, but she was adamant and pushed his chest, needing his scent and soft skin off her body. 

“I can’t. I promised Ginny I’d help with an essay.” She explained, worried she was actually running short on time.

Draco pulled back with an impressed yet funny look. 

“So your morning plans were to suck the living daylight out of me and then work on an essay? Just a normal Saturday?” He joked and Hermione smiled. 

“Just a normal Saturday.” She confirmed then reached down for her shirt and coat. Draco did the same, pulling his now cold and damp shirt over his body. 

“Still planning on subjecting yourself to teenage stupidity and a night of dull conversation on Thursday?” He questioned.

“We

teenagers. I doubt there will be any dull conversations with the amount of alcohol supplied.” She buttoned up her coat then watched as he put the final layer of his long sleeve on. He pulled his arms through but held the opening against his chest for a moment. 

“Doesn’t mean it’ll be fun. I can think of many things you could better fill your time with than that stupid party.” He said then stuck his head into the opening, hair becoming messy. 

“I like my odds. Why are you so against the party?” She crossed her arms over her body and began walking towards the exit. He trailed a few steps behind her.

“I’d be in a room full of people that don’t really care for me nor do I care for them…with a few exceptions.” He stated plainly, and it made Hermione frown. 

“That’s a bit harsh. Your friends will be there, and it would present a perfect opportunity to branch out. Don’t know if you noticed but there’s a fusing sense of unity this year.” She jabbed and Draco rolled his eyes. 

“Yes everyone is aware of how annoying the girls have been this year. Never doubt the power of gossip to bring a group of women together.” He said and Hermione stopped in her tracks, Draco paused as well. 

“That’s sexist. Don’t act like the boys haven’t been much friendlier through their own forms of gossip.” Hermione countered.

“I was only joking Granger. Well sort of.”  Draco chuckled, taking a half step to reach his arm forward, catching her by the forearm and dragging her back up to him. Hermione’s eyes fluttered down to where he held her, then back up to his face, her insides twisting like a winding staircase. Allowing her feet to move up to him, Draco dropped her arm once they were side by side again. 

“But girls are more prone to fall to it. Come on, you know it’s true.” He grinned while stuffing his hands in swishing trousers, his arm brushing hers with every step. She didn’t move away, finding their proximity in the chilly morning to be welcoming. 

“No. Boys gossip, Harry and Ron were absolute fiends for it.” Hermione explained. 

“Poor examples. They hardly count as men. More like children with rocks in their heads.” Draco grumbled and Hermione sent him a half hearted glare, while lightly hitting his chest. He gave her a pointed look but didn’t seem upset.

“You can’t act as if you’re above it all. Everyone's a victim to gossip.” Hermione said ignoring his stare, trying her best not to slip on the muddy path. “But back to the party.” 

“No, not back to the party. Let’s move on to something more stimulating. Like what will happen while the party’s going on.” Draco nudged her with his elbow and, against her intentions, she laughed. 

“It’ll be you and your hand.” She quipped and Draco cut off her walking, making Hermione bounce off his chest and nearly stumble over. 

“So sure about that?” His eyes glinted with a coy smile. 

“Extremely.” She said then tried to side step him, but he got in her way. 

“I’m not so sure. You want to know what I think?” He asked but Hermione pushed at his chest. 

“Mm, not really.” She said as she tried to get past him, but this time he grasped her wrists and yanked to the side of the archway. A panicked gasp left her mouth as she hit the stone, Malfoy then reaching to hoist her legs around his waist. She was eye level with him, trapped by his strong hips and stony stare. 

“I think you're still going to leave the party. Because as you told me a few minutes ago, you like being submissive to me.” The piece of information was of course used to his advantage and his grin only grew when she moved her hips to get comfortable. 

“Let me down.” She commanded but lacked the force behind her words. 

“You know you’re going to, you know you want to.” He whispered, letting his nose run along her jaw. “And when you show up at my door, I’ll reward you by giving you everything Granger.” 

She involuntarily shivered and felt him smirk into her skin. 

“My fingers.” He said, hips pining her safely in the air while his hands roamed up and down her thighs. 

“My lips…my tongue.” Draco took her ear between his lips then bit on it softly, causing her hips to jerk forward. 

“My cock.” He said as he thrusted her upwards, she softly sighed and allowed him to take her hands off her shoulders and hold them against the wall. 

“Everything you want. You just need to leave the party early.” He sweetly said. 

“How about this instead?” Hermione breathed, rolling her hips in his, trying to provoke him. “Come to the party for ten minutes and I’ll leave with you, then you can do whatever you want to me.” She gambled and tightened her legs around him. 

“I’ll do whatever

want, without question. Totally submissive, only for you.” She promised and Draco’s eyes began to shut at the sinful sounds, his mouth coming closer to hers. Just as she thought she had him ready to comply, sealing his agreement with a kiss, Draco widely opened his eyes, Hermione saw his wide and condescending smirk. 

“Not happening.” He then dropped her to the ground, grasping her hips so she wouldn’t fall. “Your little stunt may lead you to think you have the power, but it’s still me, Granger. You…submit…to me.” 

Her eyes widened and her breath was noticeably uneven. Still clutching her hands above her head, Draco’s stomach knotted when she smirked at him and stared at his lips. 

“I guess we’ll just have to see who breaks first then.” She panted. 

“I guess we will.” He narrowed his eyes at her before letting go of her hands then stalking away from a very flushed Hermione.

“I’m going to fuck Blaise tonight or die trying.” Daphne said and Ginny choked on her cup of strong and cheap cup of vodka. Hermione and Katie both shared a look before shaking their heads and muffling their grins into their drinks as well. 

“Little dramatic Daph.” Padma said beside her and Daphne rolled her eyes. 

“Blaise has been so hot and cold. One minute we’re in a heavy snog against the library stacks then next he won’t even talk to me, I don’t get that boy.” Daphne chanced a look over her shoulder only to be met with Blaise speaking to a seventh year Ravenclaw girl. She shook her head and faced the group. 

“Maybe he’s just playing hard to get?” Hermione offered. 

“Have to say, if a boy has you stumped, how will the rest of us do on our own?” Ginny teased. 

“Says the girl who’ll most likely marry her childhood crush.” Padma retorted and Ginny gave a look at the group. 

“Just because I’m in a happy, committed relationship does not mean I can figure out men on my own, okay?” Ginny replied with a smug grin. 

“Yeah right, you could bat your eyelashes, ask for a hippogriff and Harry would make it happen.” Hermione countered, making the girls laugh and Ginny sent a playful sneer to her friend. 

“Well what about you Granger? Move things along with Malfoy?” Daphne asked, after she took a sip of her drink. “How did your early morning quidditch practice go?” 

Hermione’s eyes widened and she stuttered over her response. It had been so long since she discussed her efforts with any of the girls, that she had half a mind to spill all the details to them. She finally knew how big Malfoy was, and she wanted to tell them how dark his sexual preferences were, but something told her they wouldn’t believe her. Then something else told her if she spilled the information, Draco wouldn’t be happy. 

“Well, we…” She began and Ginny raised her eyebrows at her, the other girls carefully listening. “I kissed him.” 

“What!?” 

“Shut up!”

“What did he do!?” 

“How did it happen?” 

“Was there tongue?”

The multiple questions were all thrown to her at once, she blushed furiously and kept her gaze then in her drink. 

“After he was done flying, we just talked and before I knew it, I kissed him. Quickly, safely, nothing, erm nothing more. Then I ran away.” She told them, obviously a lie but she had to make it a little believable, especially for someone with her more prude-ish reputation. 

“Hermione! Scandalous girl!” Ginny cheered. “Was he a good kisser?” 

She smirked into her cup while she took a drink and the girls cheered, making a few people turn their heads over at them and Hermione shushed them. 

“Don’t-don’t say anything. He was caught off guard and I’m hoping this…slow approach will benefit me.” She explained, needing to throw out some slack for them to run with it.

“Of course love, it stays in this group. Come next year though, you have to dish out all the dirty details to us, especially at the meetings.” Daphne winked and the girls agreed. Hermione nodded to them and luckily didn’t have to think about lying to her friends for the remainder of the conversation. 

Skidding by any more comments of Draco, Hermione was able to enjoy herself, for almost…an hour. She stopped drinking after her one, entirely too strong drink, before switching to half a butterbeer. The conversations were slightly amusing, ranging from funny things that happened in class, quidditch or just castle gossip. 

It was entertaining but nothing provided her with sustenance. She found herself people-watching more than interacting with her friends, observing them dance and flirt, catch some people snogging in the corner or leave to find an unoccupied room. The party was fun, filled with everything that contributed to a successful night, there was just something missing though, preventing her from letting loose. 

Her mind floated to daydreaming about what Draco would be like if he were here. He’d maybe engage her in some flirting that would only go noticed by her, perhaps engaging in a drinking game or two and making comments about how stupid it was. He’d probably coax her over to where he stood in the shadows, comment on her sickly Christmas spirited outfit but still let his eyes roam shamelessly over her body, particularly over the dip of her v-neck sweater.  

They’d talk about what fools people looked like when they’d dance. Would he ask her to dance? No, he wouldn’t want to do that. He’d ask, rather,

her to leave with him, dragging her through the quiet halls, escaping the portrait’s eyes until they were safely back in the walls of his dorm. Where he’d tell her to strip and she’d do it. Where he’d tell her what a dirty slut she is for wearing a skirt too high and she’d like it. Where he’d finally, finally, spread her legs and stick his cock between her soaked heat, and tell her how wet she is, tell her she was his slut to fuck and she took his cock so good and then tell her to come, and she would. 

Coming out of her daydream with a harsh quiver, she checked her watch and noted an hour and a half had passed. She could slip out of the room, head to the Slytherin dorms and find him without anyone knowing she was gone. Weighing her options, she began having a mental battle with herself on whether she should leave or not.  

Yes. 

But she wanted to see what would happen if she didn’t show. Would he show up? Would he break for her? If he didn’t, she could live with knowing she allowed things to end like this, besides, she got the information she needed. 

It’s worth it though, to have the anomaly, to have the one no one knows anything about and keep it a secret all for herself. She could do this one thing, for herself simply because she wanted to. 

 It wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. But she would be bending for him, again, and she didn’t want to see that stupid yet attractive smirk he’d wear when she’d show up in his dorm, knowing she caved first. 

No. 

But then what if there wasn’t another time. What if this was her one and only open opportunity to have sex with him? Draco Malfoy’s pride was as fragile as a dream, he could be offended if she turned him down. Especially after he seemed…excited for her to show up to his dorm. 

Yes and no? 

Screw his pride. 

No. 

But he seemed overly…optimistic that she would show up. Confident? Dare she say it…hopeful? 

Yes. 

Bloody fucking hell. This was giving her a headache, plus the loud crowd, music and eccentric movement was a little much for her. 

Inhaling through her nose, she set her empty cup down and shuffled past some people towards the door, looking to make an exit. 

“Hey, where’re you going?” Neville asked, interrupting a conversation he was having with Theo and Lisa. 

“Too sweaty, I’ll be right back.” Hermione said with a reassuring smile and they all turned back to their chat. 

She slipped out the door, met with the chilly air of the castle and was thankful to get away for a minute. Even if she wasn’t really drinking, she was done for the night. The joyful buzz she had earlier faded some time ago, now there was only a dull headache either from the noises or the tiredness creeping into her body. 

Resting her back against the stone walls, she shut her eyes for a moment, coming back to her daydream. 

Slow hands and teasing touches, soft pants that gradually turn into a crescendo of moans, hard thrusts, desperate holds, fiery kisses with needy strokes of each other’s tongues, a heat building within their bodies aching to escape, a baptism of sin and sex.

, she was an idiot. 

But…she still had time. 

Pushing off the wall, she quickly paced down the corridor and away from the Hufflepuff common room, heading in the direction of the Slytherin dungeons. 

Excitement bubbled inside her chest with giddy anticipation. When she sharply turned the corner, she screamed as someone's body came into view and pushed into hers. 

“Fucking hell. You scared me.” She accused, bringing a head up to her chest to calm her shaking heart. 

“Like I meant to.” Draco responded sarcastically, raising an interested brow at her reaction. “Pay closer attention to your surroundings. I could have been a professor.”

“They’re all in their rooms I checked the…” Hermione began to explain but her sentence faded when she noticed Draco’s attire. Casual light gray trousers, a black turtleneck, cologne freshly sprayed due to the intoxicatingly present scent and hair neatly tucked away despite the hour. It looked like he had just gotten ready. Did that mean? 

A slow, knowing smile spread over Hermione’s features and she leaned her weight on her hip then crossed her arms. Malfoy’s expression went from amused to confused then ended defensively. He looked at her like he was waiting for a challenge, sharp tongue ready. 

“You’re far from your common room, Malfoy. In fact,” she said and exaggerated the way she checked him out, “I’d say it looks like you’re dressed for a party. Going somewhere?” 

“Impeccably dressed doesn’t mean I’m on my way to any party.” Draco easily said back, but he knew he had been caught. There was really no other reason for his current location or attire, but that didn’t mean he didn’t notice Hermione was also away from the party, on a path possibly to the snakes common room? 

“But isn’t that where you should be? Where are you off at this hour?” He questioned, feeling his cheek dimple when she parted her mouth then closed it, pursing her lips in an aggravated frown. He had to stifle a laugh at her determined behavior. 

“I…had to run…to get…air.” Hermione awkwardly said, her left eye spasming as she looked away. Draco made a humming noise then stepped closer into her space. 

“Air huh? Is there a reason why the air just outside the door wasn’t fresh enough for you?” Draco pushed and Hermione choked a bit. 

“I like the cold closer to the dungeons. It’s less…stuffy.” God stop asking questions. Just shut up and lead her away, did he have to be so bloody annoying just to prove a point? 

“Right because a cooling charm wouldn’t do the trick. Now that you have your cool air, will you be heading back to your party?” Oh damn his coy expression, she wouldn’t let him rile her up. 

“No, I haven’t cooled off yet.” She crossed her arms over her chest defensively and Draco playfully rolled his eyes. 

“Mhm. Just admit it, Granger. You ditched the party and your friends, to come see me.” Draco said looking down at her, tongue resting on his canine while his face exploded in knowing joy. 

“No, you were coming to the party. To see

.” She squinted at him, trying her hardest not to be intimidated or turned on by how close his body and face were to her. 

He looked pensive for a moment, eyes taking in the exposed skin on her neck and chest, resting at the small pop of cleavage from her red sweater. Hermione’s chest rose high from an inhale, then his stormy eyes flickered up to hers. 

“Yes I was.” He said honestly and Hermione’s eyes rounded, absolutely stunned by his admission. The provocative expression he wore flitted lower, gaze seeming to focus on her lips for a second longer than appropriate. Her stomach fluttered. 

“You see, I was coming to collect you Hermione.” Draco’s voice sounded like a rumbling from deep within his chest, like the low baritones of thunder warning of a storm far away. “It’s been nearly two hours you’ve kept me waiting. Much too long for my liking.” 

“I told you I wasn’t coming.” She said, her chest taking deep breaths to control her heart rate.

“You said that, but you clearly didn’t mean it. We both know you were on your way to my room.” He stepped closer to her until she had to turn her head up, the smell of his breath hitting her like a car crash. 

“I-I was—“ 

“Don’t deny it.” He reached a hand up to her cheek, stroking the hump with his thumb then letting his hand drift down to her neck. One palm was nearly large enough to fit around her whole neck, she accidentally leaned into the grip, causing Draco’s navel to pleasantly leap. 

“How about this?” He began, pushing her body into the stone wall, using the pressure on her throat to guide her. “Since you were on your way, I’ll take that into consideration when we get back to my room. But once we get there, there is no leaving, no stopping. You have to trust me. Understand?” 

Hermione pondered his ultimatum, worrying if she should be afraid of what would actually happen behind closed doors. Even if his words sounded like a threat or a warning, she knew that he was still giving her a choice. He had yet to manipulate her, or take things too far. Everything they’ve done had been at her consent and he had been concerned for her well being after. 

Boldly reaching her hands out, she fisted his sweater and brought him closer, the smallest possible gap between their lips. Draco’s hand instinctively tightened and Hermione lifted her head higher to stroke his lips with hers. 

“I understand.”

Boldly reaching her hands out, she fisted his sweater and brought him closer, the smallest possible gap between their lips. Draco’s hand instinctively tightened and Hermione lifted her head higher to stroke his lips with hers. 

“I understand.” 

The second the words left her lips, Hermione’s body was dragged off the wall. Draco pulled her shoulders, hand clasping hers as he led them down the corridor. Having to half jog from his long pace, Hermione felt her muscles go weightless. She was floating to the dungeons fully aware of what was to come next.

Draco approached the common room doors, cracking the barrier and peeking his head in to ensure it was empty. With his hand still occupying hers, he pulled her though the threshold, silently leading her through the common room. She stared at the window love seat where he brought her to her first orgasm, publicly, and shuddered. Draco felt her twitch and looked behind him, seeing her eyes focused on the area then found her stare, smirking handsomely before turning his attention back to the path ahead. Hermione profusely blushed. 

Now in front of his door, Draco let go of her hand and placed it on the small of her back, the heat of his palm pushing her into his room. She noticed it was much larger than the other dorm rooms, only two beds instead of three or four, both sides of the room extremely clean and the lights dimmed to near darkness. 

The door clicked to lock, his deep voice lulling her as he placed extra locking charms on the room, the only sound between them. The reality of her situation finally hit her. She knew he’d soon order her to do whatever he pleased and she’d be eager to fulfill his demands. A warm breath ghosted over the back of her neck, sending a shiver down her spine and hardening her nipples. 

Draco raised his arm in the air, pointing his wand at the mirror resting against the opposite wall and levitated it to stand at the edge of his presumed bed, leaving a space in front of it. He enlarged it before letting it stand on its own. Hermione watched, her heart beat increasing and her palms beginning to sweat.

“Stand in front of the mirror.” He mumbled, voice thick with the rasp of desire. 

Her legs brought her forward until she was faced with the design of herself. Her cheeks were flushed, eyes wide and nearly black. She found his hungry expression, the ghost of a pleased smirk on his face before he wordlessly strolled to where she stood, standing directly behind her. 

“Take off your shoes.” He requested. Hermione held her breath as she kept his gaze and kicked off her boots, unconcerned of where she shoved them to the side. 

“Your sweater now.” He said, voice dropping. Hermione crossed her arms over her chest, fingers grasping at the material and knowing she’d soon be caught once it was off. Lifting the material over her head and dropping it to the floor, she heard Draco’s growl and felt his hand at her throat before she could refocus her attention back on the mirror. 

“Did you put this on for me?” He questioned, his hand slightly squeezing her neck. She softly gasped, eyes rolling into her head when her back met his front, his half hard erection pushing into her. Hermione opened her eyes, attention on the dark green pushup bra with a frilly white lace over the top of the cups. In her defense, it was rather seasonal, but the original color was all black and she charmed it green before putting it on tonight. 

“It’s festive.” She replied, her voice breaking off from the pressure of his hand. 

“So it wasn’t for me?” Draco darkly asked. Nose pressed into her hair as his mouth was right at her ear. Hermione met his eyes in the mirror, challenging him and feeling a spark of electricity and danger as she spoke. 

“No.” 

“Are you lying?” Draco asked, his hand tilting her neck up, his lips feathering over the skin on her jaw.

“N-no.” She said when his tongue licked down her ear to her collarbone. 

“It sounds like you are. Do you know what happens when you lie? Hm?” He asked, the softness of his tongue removing from her skin.

“What happens?” She whispered, her brown eyes now completely black as he lifted his head up to send her an evil looking grin. 

“You get punished.” 

She didn’t have time to react to his threat. Draco had turned her body away from the mirror and threw her on the bed, landing on her stomach with a soft bounce. There was a foreign feeling wrapping around her ankles, a scratchy rope that quickly tightened and spread her legs wide open, binding her to the posts at the end of the bed. Her bum was in the air, skirt rising uncomfortably high at the new position.

“Wha—“ She began but a hand wrapping into her curls cut off her words, he pulled her head up, his body leaning over hers, pressing her down. 

“Last chance,” Draco said. “Did you put this on for me?” His hand skirted over the strap, pulling it taut then releasing it so it snapped into her skin. She held back a shiver and instead panted hard. 

“No.” She stubbornly said, trying to squeeze her legs together but the new restraints offered no room to move. Draco stood to his full height, eyes taking in her body spread open for him, the blood spread to his cock, and he refrained from palming himself.

“You’re wasting our time.” He said, fingers grabbing onto a lone singlet curl, pulling it straight then releasing it. The pads of his digits followed the dip of her spine, slowing it’s path when reaching the material of her skirt. Hermione sucked in a breath, lifting her head up to watch him. 

“I could be making you come right now.” He told her, one finger slipping up the skirt, dragging the material up over the curve of her arse. “Or maybe you want to be punished?” He asked thoughtfully, fully exposing her backside.

Her knickers were green as well, the white lace running along the seam on her cheeks. 

She said nothing, and so Draco leaned a knee on the bed, on hand on her arse, the other going back into her hair. The pull of her hair feeling more relaxing than painful, she sighed deeply. 

“Is this what you wanted, Hermione? To be punished?” He asked, his palm gently stroking over one cheek. 

“No.” She said and his palm quickly rose into the air and harshly slapped her skin.

The pain came down so hard her body jolted forward, a cry tearing from her lips as the hot sting subsided under her skin. She felt the afflicted area begin to prickle and cunt grew uncomfortably wet. 

“Are you sure?” Draco said, his grip tightening in her hair. Her own hands clawing at the sheets on the bed. 

“Yes.” She pushed out, her voice barely a gasp as his hand slapped her other cheek. She fought back a moan. 

“Keep lying and you won’t get anything from me tonight. Now start telling the truth, did you wear this little set for me?” Draco got up from the bed, the lack of pressure on her head causing her to follow his movements. She looked over her shoulder to find him kneeling on the ground, both of his hands kneading her bum. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror; her legs spread wide, panties noticeably darker, arse perched with a stinging red mark of his hand. 

Draco smirked at the desperate expression she wore, but he needed her attention back on him. 

“Hermione.” He called, and her dark eyes flashed to his. “Who did you wear this for?” 

With a pleading look and a surrendering whine, she shut her eyes tight and replied to him. 

“I wore this for you.” She finally admitted, a quiet ‘oh’ floating from her mouth as Draco’s soft lips begin to kiss over the sensitive skin on her bum. 

“Then why did you lie?” His teeth began nibbling over the sensitive flesh and Hermione fisted the sheets so tight her knuckles turned white. 

“I-I wanted to see what you’d do.” She confessed, moaning when he peeled away her knickers, the cold air meeting her slick center. She grinded her hips down, trying to get friction from the mattress but the way she was bent over provided hardly any help.

“So you

want to be punished?” His fingertips ghosted across the backs of her thighs, Draco’s eyes widened as he saw the swollen center glistening in the dim light, he felt positively feral. 

“I—oh 

” she groaned when his fingers lightly parted her slit. Her body shuddered and her hips pushed against the barely there contact. “I did, yes.” 

Draco removed his touch all together, keeping away from her for too long of a moment so she began to arch higher, hoping to find contact once more. But she heard his words and felt his palm before her brain could comprehend him.

“Don’t.” 

Smack

“Lie.”

Smack

“To me.” 

Smack

“Ever.” 

Smack

“Again!”

SMACK

Hermione was panting heavily when he finished, the warmth spreading throughout her body clenching at her center, her clit throbbing for attention. She was pushing behind her, waving her hips from side to side hoping that he would actually touch her now. 

“Are you done lying?” He asked, soothing her skin. 

“Yes, yes!” She sobbed, her forehead damp with sweat. 

“Do you still want to be punished?” He snarled at her. 

“No.” She shook her head, center so sensitive that she could feel the pants of her breath on center. 

“What do you want, Hermione?” 

“Anything. Please just touch me.” She whined, lifting her hips up to him. 

“Tell me why you dressed like a slut again.” He said, fingers skimming purposely around her center. 

“Merlin

fuck—

I wanted you to like it, and tell me I looked like a slut.” The words started pouring from her mouth as if under veritaserum. Her confession made the blood pool to his dick, and Draco had to briefly squeeze himself through his trousers to relieve some pressure. 

“You look like a slut Granger, you look like

fucking slut.” 

Hermione whimpered then broke out into a full on prolonged moan as he pressed his mouth into her center. His tongue selfishly lapped at her lips and clit. His hands tightly grasped at the flesh of her arse and thighs, pulling her thighs apart to lick more of her. 

“Mmm you’re dripping for me.” He hummed into her, his hands rubbing upwards to soothe the tender skin on her arse. She flinched, her clit almost painfully throbbing as he sucked on it, running his tongue over and over in grueling circles. “My whore enjoyed being slapped.” 

“Draco…Draco.” She warned, feeling the heat bubble inside her stomach, leaving a blazing path as it spread down her thighs, she wasn’t going to last. 

“Come on my face, be a good fucking slut and come for me.” He groaned, pushing two of his fingers into her that sent her into a tailspin. 

Hermione’s back arched . She dug her head into the mattress as she screamed from the intense feeling of his fingers and tongue working over her cunt. Her walls fluttered over and over, the high lasting much longer than her previous orgasms. He continued humming into her clit, shockwaves of pleasure rolling through her veins. 

She was half coherent when he undid the ropes on her legs and turned her body over to face him. Laying on the bed with her skirt disheveled and tits begging to be released, Draco’s eyes darted all over her body, settling on her flushed cheeks and wild hair. He unclasped her bra with little effort then pulled off her skirt, frustrated with the zipper and lock so he ripped the material to make it easier for him to remove. 

“Sit up.” He told her and she pushed off from her elbows as he crawled beside her. Hermione followed his movements, ready to ask what he was doing but already having an idea. He sat directly behind her, thighs circling her body and pushing them forward until both their feet were on the ground. 

“Look in the mirror.” He said from behind, hands holding onto her thighs and bringing them over his knees. 

Her eyes lifted, finding her naked and spread in his lap, much like he had in her the common room. She didn’t view herself like this often, but seeing the image in front of her, his face right by her ear,  hands clutching her thighs and the encasing feeling of his body over hers made her inhale sharply. 

“You’re so fucking hot.” He whispered into her ear, pressing a slow kiss on the lobe while he massaged her thighs. “Wet and spread for me, so good Hermione.” 

She shivered and tilted her head onto his shoulder, but one hand came up to grip her chin, forcing her neck straight. 

“No, keep your eyes forward. I want you to watch.” He told her, the pinch on her chin leaving as she steadied her vision. She focused on the steel color of his eyes, the pink smirk on his lips and the long fingers stroking her skin. She sighed then ran her hands up and down his forearms, leaning into his chest. 

“You’re going to come again.” He whispered, softly scratching her inner thighs with his short nails and forcing her skin to break out into raised bumps. “You’re going to come again and then you’re going to suck my cock until I tell you to stop. Understood?” 

Hermione swallowed once but then met his eyes in the mirror, nodding to his demand. He gave her a pleased smile then nuzzled his face into her neck. Mumbling and kissing along her skin until she was panting once more. 

“Look how wet you are for me.” He said watching her brown eyes float down to her exposed cunt. Draco brought his right hand closer to her center, dragging his middle finger through her arousal. She twitched in his hold, watching with hunger as he brought his hand towards her. “Taste.” 

Hermione found his stare once more, his eyes intently on the o shape of her lips as she took his finger into her mouth. She hummed as the taste of herself hit her tongue, tangy and salty and surprisingly arousing. 

“Good girl.” Draco took his other hand and entered her cunt with two fingers, causing Hermione to moan around his finger. She greedily accepted his pointer finger in her mouth along with the other as Draco pumped his fingers slowly in and out of her. 

“Fuck I can’t wait to be inside you. Feel so fucking good Hermione.” He rotated his hips into her back letting her feel the massive erection. Her eyes momentarily rolled back into her head at the stretch of his fingers but he commanded her attention once more. 

“Eyes on the mirror. Look away again and I won’t let you come.” 

She responded by sucking his fingers harder into her mouth and Draco bit into the flesh under her jaw while growling. Hermione watched his fingers form a rhythm that felt too slow but too fast at once, she could feel him barely hit her spot but wanted to relish in the build up of her next orgasm. She shifted her hips into his thrusts, matching so every single time he entered, his fingers hit the spongy part of her inner walls. 

“I love the way you look when you’re close. Fucking yourself on my fingers, moaning for me, nipples hard and cunt soaking.” He completely withdrew his hand from her mouth and started circling her clit with the pads of his two fingers. “I want to hear you.” 

“Draco, I’m—“ She broke off, her eyes starting to shut as the fire grew in her stomach. 

“Look at me when I make you come.” He demanded and she kept his stare. Her heavy breathing increased, she could see Draco’s tongue poke out to collect the sweat on her neck and his forearms flex as his fingers brought her closer and closer. 

“Such a good slut for me, so perfect.” He grinned, the movement on her clit speeding up and applying more pressure. “Tell me you’re my slut.” 

“I’m yours, please.” 

“Louder.” She said, roughly slapping her clit. 

I’m your slut Draco! Please, I want to come!” She cried, toes curling with wetness sliding between her bum. 

“Fuck, come for me Hermione. Give it to me.” He said both moaning when her walls clenched around his fingers and her arousal dripped from her cunt, gushing on his digits. Her eyes were trained on his fingers pulsing into her, legs and hands gripping him while her hips thrusted spastically in his hold. She was completely overpowered by the sensation. 

“Gods yes, yes oh—“ She whined and her eyes finally felt shut as she rode out the last of her high. Draco watched through hooded eyes as she stained his sheets a darker green with her wetness. Her body was slick with sweat and her legs were drenched in her come. His stomach swelled with pride when he watched her eyes reopen and she gave him a dazed and fulfilled expression. 

“On your knees.” 

The request made Hermione’s eyes open. He was already shifting her up and hoisting her hips to stand. Once on her feet she turned, watching as he removed his sweater, the material ruffling his hair which made him look unfairly attractive. His gray eyes glinted as she sank to her knees, hands relaxed at his sides. 

“Pull me out.” He rasped. 

Hermione looked up at him from under her lashes as she undid his belt and button. Once the zipper was down, her fingers fisted the waistband of his trousers and briefs and pulled them down. His cock lifted, the thickness and girth of him surprising her once more. She eyed the angry red tip with amazement and slowly lowered her mouth closer to him, wanting to lick away the dripping precum. 

“Give me your hands.” He stated and she held her movements. 

“What?” She asked. 

“Your. Hands.” He said once more. 

“But I need to—“ 

“You’re only using your mouth.” He cut her off and Hermione felt her stomach coil. She didn’t know how well she could work him with only her mouth, but she was determined not to disappoint, especially after he easily brought her to two orgasms.

 Raising her hands up, her wrists together, Draco grabbed them and pinned them to his chest, causing her body to push into his, mouth smudging over his tip. He tangled his free hand in her curls, the grip firm and commanding. 

“Now suck. I want to see that pretty mouth of yours filled with me.” 

She quaked at his words and opened her mouth, tongue lapping on the underside of him as she immediately put as much of him in her mouth that she could manage. The moan he emitted from above her vibrated straight into her core. Hermione clenched her fists before flattening her palms against him. His hand may restrict her but she could still feel the ridges of his chest and abs. 

“Yeah…yeah, fucking swallow me.” Draco began shallowly thrusting his dick into her mouth, holding her head in place while controlling a speed safe for her. His eyes fell to the mirror, seeing her back arched and the movement of her head over him with her arse spotting a red print of his hand. 

His balls tightened and he thrusted too deeply in her throat. Hermione choked, tears springing to her eyes as she breathed hard. Draco pulled himself out until she was just licking the tip, letting her catch a second to readjust. Hermione brought him deep into her mouth again, spit rolling down her lips as she sucked and licked him. 

Feeling his stomach pull, Draco swiftly pulled her off him, hauling her back onto her feet. 

“So good. You did so good Hermione.” He mumbled as he began kissing her softer than before, holding her cheeks and being sure the drag of his lips lasted long. He’d occasionally slip his tongue into her mouth, provoking a heavy sigh from their chests. 

Her hands paved down his body, over his stomach and onto his back and shoulders, reveling in the warmth of his skin. She felt overly tired, but when his fingers skidded over her navel, the muscles flexed and the burn in her core started again. 

“Mmm.” She hummed and Draco smirked, his ego growing exponentially tonight. 

“Feel good?” He asked and she responded by kissing over his chest and neck, sucking a mark deep under his skin. 

“Did you like sucking my cock?” He asked and Hermione shivered, continuing to run her tongue over the new bruising skin. 

“So much.” She whispered, her thighs glued together. Draco pinned her body to his, hands growing impatient, needing to touch her all over. 

“How much?” 

Hermione pulled away rising to her tip toes so her lips hovered directly over his. She languidly kissed him, her tongue snaking away before he could 

having you in my mouth.” She kissed him, whispering the dirty words into his mouth. “So hard and thick, I like how you fill my whole mouth.” 

Momentarily shocked by her words, both Draco and Hermione looked at each other with wide eyes. Draco lowered his stare first, his cock growing harder. 

“Fucking hell, my dirty girl.” He reattached their lips, desperation and pure need between them. He turned them around, pushing at Hermione’s shoulders until she fell on the bed and crawled up towards the pillows. Draco crawled over her, lips finding any patch of skin from her thighs up to her stomach. 

“I’m going to fuck you until you scream my name.” 

It was certainly a daunting promise, but Hermione knew it wouldn’t take much from him to fulfill it. He rose to his knees and spread her legs open, her heels pressed against the mattress. 

“You’re dripping for my cock.” He took his member in his hand, heavy and waiting to sink into something, and tapped it against her clit. “Is my filthy slut ready for me to fill her?” 

Hermione eagerly nodded, her breathing increasing when he pushed two fingers inside her. She bucked her hips into him. 

“Answer me. Tell me what you want.” He commanded, removing his fingers and putting them into his mouth. She watched through heavy eyelids, her juices glistening in the lowlight, his lips sucking his digits clean off. She pushed her hips up again, her slit running over his head. 

“I want you in me.” She breathed. 

“You want me to fuck this cunt?” He leaned down over her, palms by her head.

“Oh gods yes.” She lifted her hips up, trying to feel any pressure in her center.

“Want me to stretch you until you beg me for more?” He pushed the head of himself into her and she jumped, hands clawing at his biceps to get him closer. 

“Yes, yes.” 

“My dirty fucking girl…beg for it.” He ordered, stilling his hips so she didn’t feel anything more. 

“Please, Draco, please fuck me.” Her hips were moving wildly, desperate for him. “I need you so bad. Fuck me, please.” She whimpered and Draco’s heart skipped at the words. He pushed himself inside her, a blinding white light coming over his eyelids as he felt for the first time Hermione Granger’s cunt.

“Fuck, fuck you’re so tight, so wet.” Draco hissed, eyes scrunched together as her cunt squeezed him with a vice grip. He wasn’t even totally in, and the warmth of her dripping center was enough to make him worry how long he was going to last.

Hermione was wheezing, the pain of his length making her slightly freak out as it was much more harder to accommodate him seeing as he was only the second person she ever had sex with. The inhales she took were short and labored, her nails digging so harshly into his skin there were half moons. 

“Hey.” Draco nudged his nose along her jawline, the action briefly calming her. His lips peppered kisses until she responded by rubbing her cheek against him, trying to access him. A deep and baritone moan carved out of his throat when Hermione accidentally fluttered around him. 

“Just breathe, I’m going to push the rest of the way in.” He said and continued kissing her as she nodded. His tongue wove patterns into her mouth, twists and touches that made her barely feel when he pushed into her to a hilt. Her walls began tightening again and Draco let out a breathy chuckle. 

“Keep doing that and I won’t last.” Draco told her and Hermione smiled, courageously wrapping one leg over the small of his back and purposely clenching her walls around him. They both moaned, and when Draco opened his eyes, there was a sliver of gray left. Running his tongue over his teeth, he sent her a dangerous look. 

Without warning, he pulled out almost completely, then shoved his cock back into her waiting cunt. She cried out, the immediate pain subsiding when he hit her g spot. His hands dove into her hair, acting as if he were holding her on a tight leash. 

“You want it fast and hard?” He growled and began thrusting his hips into her at a pace she wasn’t ready for. The stretch of her cunt around him gave her a strange pain but a pleasurable and addicting feeling. She was chasing the high, unconcerned with how needy she sounded.

“Ohh…I—I need,” 

“Tell me what you need.” Draco said, somehow quickening his pace so his hips snapped down into her.  He rose up into a pushup position, throwing her other leg around him so she was anchored. 

“Yes, just..like that, yes!” Hermione moaned, her hands grabbing onto his forearms. His cock driving her to delirium, the thickness offering a perfect stretch. The tip of his cock hitting something that felt slightly painful but more erotic than anything. 

“Take it, yeah my good little cock whore.” 

Hermione couldn’t help but release explicit moans. She’s never felt so full, and the quick pace he was going at made her thighs shake, his thrusts powerful enough to make her sob.

Draco watched her tits bounce with every thrust, finding it unfair how she couldn’t see how fucking hot she looked right now. Pulling out of her and resting back on his knees, he pushed her into a sitting position by her arms. 

“Get on all fours, face the mirror.” He instructed half turning so she could crawl to the edge of the bed. Hermione bent down, sticking her bum in the air and trying to arch her back. She stared with heated eyes at the reflection; Draco appreciating the view of her arse, running his hands over the skin he brutalized earlier, holding her hips in place then finally sinking back into her. 

He threw his head back while he moaned, his pale skin shining with sweat and pink lips opened while his face screwed up in pleasure. 

“Gods Hermione, your cunt is perfect. You’re perfect.” He bounced her arse off his hips, eyes opening to watch each other in the mirror. When he saw she was already staring, he smirked then began thrusting harder. 

“Look at yourself getting fucked by me. Taking my cock like such a good girl.” 

Hermione moaned loudly and arched her back further, her arse highly and spread for him. 

“Fuck, Draco. Feels so good.” 

He reached over her, pulling her up to her knees by her throat, choking her until she gasped. 

“Say it again.” He groaned into her ear, leaning back on his heels so she sunk farther down on him. 

“Oh…oh yes. You feel so good.” She whined when he shallowed his thrusts, hitting her g spot with perfect precision. 

“Tell me you like getting fucked like a slut.” He groaned, eyes shutting when her walls squeezed him, pulling him in like a vortex.

“I-I like getting fucked like a-a slut, fuck!” She instantly replied, head thrown back when his hands moved to cover her breasts. 

“So much better than that party hm?” He pinched her nipples and she cried out, her hands covering his as he toyed with them. 

“Yes, yes! So much better.” The delicious pinch in her cunt was close to being released. 

“You know better now don’t you? Then to pass up getting railed by my cock?”  He bit into her neck, harshly sucking and licking so his print would be there in the morning. 

“I do, fuck yes I do. Don’t stop, oh god.” Hermione was frantically pushing her hips back into his, not understanding how she could feel so full but still need more from him. 

Draco thrusted so deeply inside her there was no room left for him to keep going. Every push of his hips caused her to tighten up, moans growing louder and rowdy, calling his own climax forth, but he wanted one more from her before he finished. 

“M’gonna fill you up. Fuck you’re gripping me.” Gripping the tender flesh of her hips, Draco drove his cock into her, needing to feel her release. 

“Uhh, fuck…Draco—Dra—“ She cried out, the thickness of him sliding in and out causing her stomach to flip.CA

“That’s right say my fucking name. Tell me who’s making you feel this good.” One hand slithered down to her clit, massaging the swollen nub until he could feel her shake. 

“Draco! I’m-I’m close!” Hermione wailed, her toes curling and her thigh muscles tightening as the heat burned in her body.

“My dirty slut ready to come again?” He applied more pressure on her clit, needing another moan from her.

“Yes! Please, I want to come all over you.” Her mouth parted, wide as a scream was ready to make its way out of her throat. Her arousal was dripping down her legs, her clit throbbing as he played with it. 

“Tell me again.” He demanded and she lost. 

“I want to come on your cock! Fuck Dra—I’m coming! ” She groaned frustratingly, her resolve slipping and she fell over the edge as he moaned at her words. Her orgasm crashed over her body like a tidal wave, washing away every pinched nerve and tight muscle. Her cunt flexed over and over, causing Draco to roll his eyes back.

“Oh shit..yes Hermione come, come on me. Just like that. Oh fuck!” He pumped himself inside her, the tight grip of her cunt beckoning him to the end and he felt his balls tighten. “Gonna come inside you, fill you up. Fucking hell Hermione.” 

He held her hips in place and spurted inside her, the warm load filling her center as she still struggled to breathe in his arms. Writhing in place, she could feel the head of him pulsing, a couple more thrusts before he completely stopped but didn’t move to withdraw. 

Bringing his hands up to her stomach to keep her close, both of their eyes peeled open at the same time. They gazed at their sweaty and naked bodies still joined in the mirror. Hair was favorably disheveled, cheeks glowing, chest heaving with air and eyes content with gratification. 

Both mouths formed small smiles, then Draco heaved them backwards onto the bed. A small squeak left Hermione’s mouth, she turned in his hold, wanting to face him. His strong hands cuddled her into his chest as he stroked her hair and kissed the crown of her head. A deep sigh blew past her lips and she began to slowly scratch his back. 

“How do you feel?” He asked quietly, palm still combing down her hair. 

“Good.” She said simply, her thighs damp with his and her own finish. 

“You’re not hurt at all? I thought I was kinda rough with the slapping.” He admitted worriedly. 

“No I—it was—I liked it.” She stuttered, happy that her face was pressed into his chest. “It was good.” 

“Yeah?” He asked while squeezing her arse. She lightly giggled, a breath passing through her nose

“Surprisingly. It was all very…good.” She said again and Draco made an amused sound. 

“Is good really the only adjective you can come up with right now? I had you screaming for my co—“ 

“I’ll take back what I said if you’re going to act like a conceited prick.” She challenged quickly, blushing at his words despite her own sentences she was yelling minutes ago. 

“I thought you liked my conceited prick. You certainly did when I made you come.” He chuckled. 

Hermione huffed loudly, and tried to wiggle her body out of his grasp. She twisted and turned but only made Draco laugh more. His arms held her in place, her tiny frame having no fight against his strong figure. 

“Where do you think you’re going?’ He questioned when she attempted to peel her body off his. 

“Back to the party you annoying git.” She replied with humor in her voice. 

“No you’re not. You’re staying here. Until the morning.” He said adamantly, fingers skimming down her side, causing her to twitch further. 

“No. I’m not.” She said with a gasp, too ticklish in that sensitive area. She tried to shove his arms down but he just rolled over her, succeeding in trapping her.  

“Yes you are. Now stop moving before you jab me in the balls.” He warned. Hermione looked down thoughtfully as if considering going through with it. But Draco got her evil thoughts and halted them by pressing his forehead onto hers. “Don’t even think about it.” 

“I wasn’t.” She feigned innocence, but Draco snorted then rolled off her, laying on his back with her moving to his side. He wrapped a leg around hers until they were twisted together.

“Yeah right. You’re not as innocent as you try to project.” He accused with a grin then shut his eyes. 

“I never claimed to be.” She responded with confidence and laid half of her head on his pectoral. His hand began playing with her hair again, the soothing motion and the exhaustive actions from previous made her eyelids feel heavy. She closed her eyes, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat until he disturbed the peace. 

“Twenty three and six centimeters.” He said and Hermione couldn’t understand the random numbers. 

“Huh?” She commented, pulling her head off his chest. 

“That’s the size of my dick hard.” He explained and her heart suddenly stopped working. “Twenty eight for my feet.” 

Hermione rose up to rest on her elbow. She narrowed her eyes at him and processed the new information, accidentally looking down at the now soft member. It must have been a pinky’s length smaller than when it was erected. Flicking her gaze back up to him, he looked at her with a knowing stare and she pressed her lips together tightly before finally asking. 

“How did you find out?” 

Draco’s lips slowly turned upwards into a catlike grin. 

“I thought you’d never ask.” 

“Well you made it seem like you were eventually going to tell me on my own. But it’s been weeks.” She explained obviously. “So spill. Is there a rat inside the group?” 

“No, not at all. I found it quite difficult with your protective enchantments to break through your meetings. That’s why I first asked what they were, it was just for my own intellectual curiosity.”

Hermione frowned. “Okay, well if my spells worked and no one snitched, how did you get info about what’s discussed in our meetings?” 

“It took a lot of patience and attentiveness to confirm the location and schedule of your meetings. Once I figured that out I began to seek out bitter third and fourth years who were excluded from the get togethers. I bought their loyalty with shiny galleons and used them as spies.” He divulged. 

“You slippery snake. Why did you need to know anything?” She questioned and Draco rolled his eyes. 

“You lot had every seventh and eighth year male curious about what was causing such a change in atmosphere. They all attempted to penetrate the meeting and find out what was going on behind the curtain. I played dumb, pretended not to care, but assembled my own plan and was quite successful.” He smiled and shifted his head to get more comfortable. 

“That doesn’t explain why

found it interesting. You’ve been…uninterested in everything this year so why our group?” Hermione asked, more questions coming to her mind the more he revealed. 

“I was hoping the club would lead to some information for leverage over the boys. Damn was I right.” He chuckled and Hermione rolled her eyes at the typical Slytherin response. 

“When did you first get information about the group then? And how did your little spies get information if they weren’t in the group.” 

“Two weeks before you had your version of a cock sorting ceremony. And just because your meetings are air tight, doesn’t mean other girls don’t discuss it outside the meetings, like in the common rooms, bathrooms, hallways that girls think are empty or even out in the open at meals.” Draco listed and Hermione felt her jaw drop with annoyance.

“Bloody loose lips.” Hermione was astonished that some of the girls could be so careless. They were witches after all, how hard would it be to cast a muffliato? All the lengths she went to to ensure their personal discussions were entirely between them. 

“Yep. I had spies in every house too, so I received quite a bit of information during those three weeks.” Draco said then stretched his arms over his head with a yawn. The action was somewhat endearing but Hermione still needed more information. 

“Wait, you only had spies for three weeks?” She asked and he nodded with a hum. “Why did you stop then?” 

“I found out pretty quickly you were going through with your plan to seduce me. I wasn’t really interested in anything else going on in the group after that.” He said but the admission felt strange on his tongue. Unsure of how she would take the revelation, he kept his face stoic. 

“So you…were going to let me seduce you?” Hermione felt a foreign sensation twitch in her stomach, much like when he’d catch her gaze in the hallway or unnecessarily keep their arms touching during Charms class, or go out of his way to seek her out. 

“Well I was but you were taking too long for my liking. So I decided you were the one who needed to be seduced.” 

“I-I wasn’t—“ She began, surprised that he was actually waiting for her to make a move. “I wasn’t aware that you would have so easily accepted my efforts…or me.” 

Draco sensed the hint of insecurity and sat up, cupping her jaw and kissing her tenderly. Hermione eagerly responded, her stomach igniting in flight.

“I didn’t think you would accept mine either if I’m being honest.” He expressed, his gray eyes full of vulnerability. She slightly smirked, then ran her tongue quickly over her bottom lip. 

“Guess we both surprised each other then.” She said and Draco matched her expression then laid back down, Hermione following suit. 

“I regret to inform you though, the information about my body isn’t to be shared.” He said with his eyes shut and Hermione chortled. 

“I just told them I stole a kiss last week so I doubt any of the girls think I’ll see this through. If I ever tell them I’m sure they’ll think I’m lying.” Hermione sighed but Draco found the information to be useful for his benefit. 

“S’okay. Sod what they think. Maybe after the holiday I’ll

 finally

kiss you back. And come March I’ll touch you for the first time.” He joked, but his voice lowered. “And maybe by April you’ll get a taste of me and from there, who knows. Of course, we’ll be doing much more between now and then though.” 

“Hm, quite a thought out itinerary. Have you thought this through?” She questioned, pleased to hear that he still wanted to continue their fooling around. 

“Possibly. Ideas start rolling after you wore that skirt in the library. Naughty girl knew exactly what she was doing.” He pinched the flesh on her side and Hermione felt herself blush. 

“I didn’t think it would provoke such a strong reaction.” She mumbled against his chest. 

“So much so I was having dreams about it in the days after.” He admitted and Hermione’s ego swelled, though she’d never confirm. “I suggest you wear one on the first day back after holiday.” 

“Swine.” Hermione smacked his chest, earning a chuckle from him. The pair lazily touched each other’s skin, listening to the flickering of the candle lights and the quietness of their breathing. Hermione looked down to where their legs were tangled, following the outline of his feet.

“Your feet are actually quite massive.” Hermione noted thoughtfully and Draco gave a belly laugh. Flushing her body to his and running the point of his nose into the sweet scent of her hair. He softly kissed the top of her head then looked down at his own feet, admiring them a bit before speaking slyly.

“Well you know what they say: the bigger the feet…”
