She floated feeling her body as light as air, as if had lost all mass and weight. Her breath flowed like a gentle evening breeze, natural and effortless. Very kindly, her body lowered until her feet touch on something damp and cold. This made her eyes opened and saw a very familiar scenario.Not a place she knew, or was stepped before, but a place she has knew from her dreams. Aurora was over a surface of water as vast as the ocean. Over her head, there was a sky replete with stars that seemed bigger and brighter than she usually saw, shining like gemstones inlaid in space. And this sky had the strangest moon that she had seen.What kind of moon was that? What a strange shape! Not exactly a half moon once one side was rounded as a distorted drop. And why there was a black dot inside the rounded part? That shape didn't make any sense, looking like something incomplete. But the moon always appeared like that. Repeatedly in all her dreams. An incomplete half moon lost in space.And inside that oneiric scenario, she felt so incomplete as that half moon. She was missing a piece of her, an half, and was feeling cold and fear. It was like being tied and restricted, unable to move freely. When lonely and sad, she used to sing and did this. Her lips began to move and she heard her own voice echoing around the place as if reverberate in each molecule.

I walked with you once upon a dream

That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam

Yet I know it's true

That visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you, I know what you'll do

You'll love me at once

The way you did once upon a dream

But if I know you, I know what you'll do

You'll love me at once

The way you did once upon a dream

I walked with you once upon a dream

The gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam

Yet I know it's true

That visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you, I know what you'll do

You'll love me at once

The way you did once upon a dreamShe sung in a melancholy and somber tone, her voice coming from the depths of despair, a dark, scary and lurid place.Aurora was tired of being just a half moon floating alone in space."I want an entire moon. I want the other half!" She asked looking at the sky. The water swirled under her feet like a whirlwind, she looked down and saw the reflection of the half white moon. Then something happened. The reflection spinned on its own while the color was changing until to become the exact opposite of half white moon. Now it was a black half moon with a white spot inside the rounded end.Aurora looked up and then down. She stood right where the two halves should connect. But they were still separated. One above the sky, another below the waters. That was wrong! It was necessary to join the two halves. Just so her life would make sense.She knelt on the watery surface trying to penetrate it, but despite being made of water, there was something that kept her from sinking to reach the half moon, so close and unachievable. And she still felt incomplete as ever..."Wake up, honey! It is morning!" A distant voice spoke, making her wake with a start. Flora was next to bed holding the clothes for wear that day."Where am I?" She asked rubbing her eyes still confused. Ah, yes... she had dreamed the same dream again."In your room, silly goose!" Merryweather replied taking the sheets off. "No wasting time, you need to get dressed to start your day!" (*)The feeling caused by that strange dream was still vivid in her memory. For several months, she saw only a incomplete half moon. This time she saw what appeared to be the other half, but the incessant fairies' chattering, especially the discussion between Flora and Merryweather about the color of the dress, diverted her attention."Excuse me, Your Highness!" Said a maid after making a bow. "The king and queen are waiting at the throne room."Fairies finished to dress and comb Aurora, leaving her beautiful as a princess must be and led her into the presence of the king and queen."Good morning, father, mother." She graciously greeted like an angel, leaving her parents proud."Good morning, my daughter. Did you sleep well?""Yes, father.""How nice! Now get ready for your classes today. We will see you at lunch time."Aurora bowed again and withdrew with the fairies for her etiquette class.Her teacher was a woman about thirty years in charge of teaching her to behave like a perfect princess. She had to walk with correct posture and gracefully, always smile and just talk with soft and calm voice. A princess could never raise her voice.After that, harp lessons, embroidery and poetry. While the teacher gave the lesson, Aurora distracted remembering that strange dream. On a piece of paper she drew the strange white half moon, putting a black spot on its rounded end. Then she dipped the pen in ink and drew the black half, which perfectly complemented the white half making a harmonious and complete circle with a S-shaped curvature in the middle dividing the two areas. It was as if the boundaries between them were flexible and malleable, also giving the idea of constant movement. Another oddity was each half having a point of the same color than the other. It was as if one had a little of the other within itself. They complemented each other while mingled.Separate they made no sense, but together..."Please, Your Highness. Could you recite the verses I just dictate?" Asked the woman calling her attention again and she had to hide the drawing before she was reprimanded.During the morning and the part of the day she had to do "princess chores", tasks that, after some months had passed, didn't interest her anymore. After Philip woke her, Aurora could live with her parents having fairies to take care of her. At the beginning everything was new and she was enjoying the new life. But now everything seemed boring to her, so used to walk freely by forest without nobody telling her all time what to do, when and how to do.If she at least had Philip by her side, things could be better. But he had to go back to his kingdom along his father because they were in troubles with the king of a neighboring country which wanted to declare war. This king was a conqueror, always annexing new territories to his kingdom. And she hadn't seen Philip since then. Aurora had turned eighteen two months ago and had to spend the birthday without news of her beloved prince.Her heart seemed to be always empty, incomplete, like missing a part of her. She felt the same when was a peasant girl living in the woods with her three aunts. At that time, she also missed something that couldn't define, therefore believed to be the desire to find a great love. After she met Philip, that emptiness was filled. At least it seemed to her. But he had to go and the emptiness returned again.In her bedroom, alone, she wondered if Philip thought of her. Why that emptiness persisted? She had found her true love, hadn't she? That should be enough! Even though he was away, their hearts were near. At least they should be."Yes... our hearts are close. I can feel it!" One hand touched her chest and she had the feeling that no heart beat there. Why not? It should beat!Feeling a strange thing within, Aurora picked up the drawing she had done and looked lingeringly. There were two complete halves that balanced and harmonized each other. Were she and Philip two halves?Suddenly her heart seemed to say no. But her head kept saying yes. Who was right? Trying to push those disturbing thoughts, Aurora began to sing softly."When my love will back? When he'll come back to me?" She sang carelessly. "When we would be together forever, my sweetheart and me?" and a voice answered."Oh, very soon, my dear, very soon! Oh, what dress is this? Blue? No, no, no! Pink!" Flora busted inside suddenly, shook the magic wand and a very bright light hit her, making the dress became pink. "Much better, do not you think?"The young woman just smiled. If her fairy felt happier that way, all right."You said Philip and I'll meet soon...""Did I? Ah, yes! Your father received news early today. He and his father are coming from distant lands and it seems that the negotiations were very good.""So there will be no more war?""I hope not, dear. A war is always very sad. Now let us rejoice! You need to prepare for the return of your prince. You should be beautiful and perfect for him! One day, you two will get married and..."The fairy began to talk incessantly for Aurora, who only listened in silence with a slight smile on her face. After five minutes, her mind turned off. That conversation was so boring! Fairies always spoke about the same things. Everything was interesting when she was sixteen. Now, with eighteen, her brain seemed to ask for more complex matters."Ah, there you are!" Merryweather roared entering into the bedroom along with fauna. "And you ruined the beautiful dress I made for her! Blue! I said blue!""Grrr! Rose!"Having her dress changed constantly could be fun if they choose different colors. Why there was only pink or blue as options? And why the fairies didn't stop a bit to ask what she wanted? She even didn't like those colors!Her head ached slightly with those thoughts and also because of the relentless fight between the fairies."Raspberries!" She graciously spoke with a forced smile on her face, making the fairies stop the discussion. "I'd like to make a delicious raspberries pie for my beloved father!""Awwww!" the three spoke at once.Occasionally, Aurora liked to prepare delicious pies to her father with berries collected by her own hands in the forest near the palace.The fairies didn't care because it kept the princess entertained for a long time. With that, they could take care of more important matters with the king and queen about the future of the kingdom.Aurora ran to the stables of the palace carrying a basket and after sure no one was looking, she chose a simple horse and rode into the forest that stood around the palace where she used to pick berries. From inside the hollow of a large tree, she took a big package and ran into the bushes with a big smile of satisfaction on her face. Finally some fun!In a distant place in the forbidden land, clouds condensed in the sky in a kind of whirlwind that was slowly descending to the ground. Greenish rays sparkled on all sides and a strong wind blew mercilessly. From the ground, also came out a swirl carrying earth into the sky, meeting the swirling air.From the right, formed a tube of fire and left, pure and clean water. Both met at the intersection of ground and air swirl. The four elements are mixed making a great noise and emitting an absurd amount of green lightning everywhere. Any living creature that was around would have frozen with fear.Little by little, the four elements were condensed in a tall and sinister figure who wore a long black and purple cloak, had large horns on her head and was holding a scepter with a green ball on top. Her eyes opened, showing an intense green glow as she breathed deeply the fresh air around her."Finally, I am back!" Hysterical laughter echoed through the air. She stretched her arms lazily, as if putting out all the accumulated tension for two whole years. So good to be alive again!(*) In the Middle Ages, nobles didn't have breakfast because it was seen as gluttony. They usually had two meals a day, dinner at mid-day and a lighter supper in the evening. So, no breakfast to Aurora. Sorry, princess...

Inside her private chambers, Maleficent was resting to recover her strength. Her body wasn't totally healed and strong yet. Her heart was still vulnerable and a simple stroke of a dagger could kill her again. Then it would be another effort to rebuild her body."The half moon... that dream again!" She murmured looking at the ceiling where there was an exquisite paint with two dragons flying around a stylized sun. The same dream repeated every night. She was at the bottom of a lake and at her feet, a black half moon with a white dot. But it wasn't a moon. She knew what was that and also knew what meant the awful feeling of being incomplete, limited like a bird with only one wing.Then, looking up, she saw the same picture above the waters, but white with a black dot. She tried to achieve the other half and always waked up before touch it. Her experience told repeating dreams kept messages. It could be the message she hoped so much? For a long time she believed everything was lost because of those stupid fairies. For the first time, she thought there might be hope."Everything is still very vague. It is better to wait and let things happen naturally. For now, I need to think about other issues..."She thought what to do in the next days. Sooner or later they was going to know she had returned. This didn't scare her, of course. She was just worried about choosing the best way to make her triumphant return. It had to be something dramatic, intense and show everyone that she was alive, healthy and stronger than ever. They had stolen from her something very important and this couldn't be unpunished."They have hurt me for the last time! That will never happen again, I promise!"Those idiots had to learn to respect her anyway, even if she had to use force. For now, she needed to restore the energy. Although she continued powerful and strong, she still had a weakness that needed to be cured. Why her heart was taking so long to heal? She had died and risen other times and everything was always fine. Death and birth were part of life, the way nature is renewed. What had changed? That sword blow was so strong to the point to weaken that vital organ?Even knowing the sword was enchanted by the fairies, she didn't believe in any way those insects had so much power. No, something was very wrong. Well... speculate was useless. She needed to rest and strengthen. Meanwhile, she spent the time planning her triumphal return."I can imagine their faces when they see me again!" she was delighted to imagine the horror and surprise stamped on their faces: The fairies squirming with fear and anger and the king and the queen surely dying of fear. Maybe the idiot prince was going to try to fight her again, the pathetic thing! He only succeeded once because had a lot of help. Otherwise he'd have been crushed like a cockroach.Beside her bed had a pot with fresh water and fruits that maids had left for her. She drank some water and continued to staring at the ceiling. What a boring! It had nothing interesting to do?Inside the carriage and escorted by royal entourage, Philip looked the landscape along the way recalling the last year events. How many difficulties! His kingdom was about to suffer a war and it was necessary to negotiate, bargain and cajole the idiot king and yet they still live under the threat of imminent war.His father was snoring soundly oblivious to what was happening around him. Poor old man! He really needed to rest. There were few decent places to spend the night and most inns had only several straw beds in a common room. So used to sleep in a large bed with linen sheets, he really suffered a lot with such poor accommodations. He couldn't bear it anymore. No, a prince should be in a palace served by servants and having at his side a beautiful princess."Aurora..." he thought. "How is she now? Does she still beautiful? I hope so!" he thought a little afraid of being forced to marry an ugly woman. Well, she has received a gift of beauty from a fairy, so of course she was still pretty as a woman was supposed to be.Even though he appreciated her beauty very much, he wasn't marrying her only because of her beautiful eyes. That marriage was going to bring many advantages that he cared much more. Stefan's kingdom was very rich, with many precious metals and gemstones underground, abundant harvests every year thanks to the very fertile soil, a powerful army and many good allies. Aragon, the king who was causing so much headache, was subduing small neighboring kingdoms and becoming more powerful with the wealth gained. But he never dared to threaten Stefan. Marrying with Aurora, he was about to get a great ally.Best of all, he was the only heir to his father's throne and Stefan didn't have a son to succeed him. So the two kings agreed to unite their kingdoms, what was going to make them stronger and protect everyone from Aragon's greed.Everything was perfect and his future was bright. Nothing could ruin that.In the Royal Library, Aurora was choosing some books to read later. Nearby, Merryweather watched carefully. Why fairies cared so much about the books she read? It was like this since the days when they lived in the forest. The fairies brought carefully selected books and always dodged when she asked for something different from novels and fairy tales."I think you got the wrong book.""Wrong book? No, I was looking for that.""Applied Astronomy? This is not a romance, dear. It is a very complicated book made just for experts men."She had the distinct impression the fairy gave a special tone to the word "men"."I just want to look...""A princess does not deal with these subjects. What? 'Understanding of Geometry'? Why would you want to learn geometry? Such book is not for a woman.""Why? Is it forbidden?""Women do not have... hmm... 'skills' to learn about such subjects.""Is there a problem with women?""They are fragile, delicate, and their brains do not support these so complicated subjects! Oh please, let me choose a beautiful romance that you will like."Aurora felt something revolting inside. She had no weak head and felt perfectly able to understand those complicated books. She opened the mouth to say something when Merryweather returned happy and smiling holding a thin book."This story is beautiful! A knight saves the princess from the evil dragon and they live happily ever after. Look, there are many pictures and few words."The fairy opened the book and Aurora saw a picture of a beautiful green dragon spitting fire. That story didn't interest her one bit because it should be like all the others that she read. But since it had drawings of dragons, she accepted."Are there other books about dragons here?""Haha, you like to see knights in shining armor defeating these beasts, is not it? I know it is because of Philip!"No, that wasn't because of Philip. And no, she didn't like to see the dragons being killed. Merryweather looked through shelves and returned with two more books."I think it is enough. Do not overload your head with so much reading!"The other books that Aurora had chosen were returned to the shelf and she had no choice but to go back to her bedroom taking those boring and unfunny romances. Well... at least the pictures were worth. Were the dragons the same as the drawings? How was a real dragon? She had never seen. Only Philip, who had fought against Maleficent in dragon form.Whenever she asked he used to be evasive and didn't talk much. Shouldn't a man boast for defeating a dragon and be happy to tell the feat? Another strange and inexplicable thing. She started reading."The knight was fighting fiercely against the dragon..." Always a knight. Always a man. Why couldn't maidens face the dragons and save themselves? Why dragons were concerned about kidnap princesses? Stories never explained this strange behavior. Would be to devour them? How a dragon was able be fed only with a weak and delicate women?She put the books aside and stared at nothing looking for answers to questions that shouldn't even be made. Was she supposed to be thinking those things? Shouldn't a princess only care with her royal duties and be perfect?A strong feeling of boredom took hold of her again. There was an inexplicable emptiness inside her, a feeling that something was missing. And she couldn't talk about this because everyone wanted her to be always perfect. Nobody ever wonder that even a princess may have problems and needed to talk about them. Sometimes she felt suffocated like she had trouble to breath. Being constantly watched by three fairies, by servants and her parents was gradually undermining her sanity. Then she escapes from time to time as a way to mitigate this prison that suffocated her.She hoped everything was going to get better after her marriage. Perhaps, being a married woman and soon a queen, she could have a little more freedom.But Aurora didn't feel really happy, which brought a lot of self criticism. She must be the happiest woman in the world. A beautiful princess, living in a palace, having three dedicated fairies caring for her needs and any problems to occupy her mind. What was wrong with her?She looked again at the dragon drawing in the book and thought of Maleficent. How would have been the life of that strange woman? Was she free? Could she do whatever she wanted?"In the end, she died with the stroke of a sword. What a waste!" If she were free and independent as that fairy, Aurora would never waste her precious time on trivialities but enjoy her freedom and be happy. Was that woman so stupid?Or there was a part of the history that has not been told?

Stefan read and reread the letter with great satisfaction. Finally his son in law was coming back to marry his daughter, which filled him with satisfaction. So they could resume the natural course of things. First, the engagement party to announce the wedding date. It had to be a big party. After a few months, the wedding. Everything had to be perfect."Dreaming awake, dear?""Hmm? Ah, yes, sorry. I was making some plans for the future. This marriage will bring us much joy!""Ah, my little daughter! Finally she is getting married!""And within a while, we will have grandchildren! I hope the first child is a boy!""I want a little girl too so can to pamper her like I never had a chance to do with our daughter!"They continued weaving plans for the future, which looked bright and promising for them. Everything seemed perfect and there wasn't even a shred of concern. Since the death of Maleficent, they didn't have to worry about anything else.Under the anxious gaze of the two other fairies, Flora gave the finishing touches on the last page of the book."'And they lived happily ever after. The end'! Ah, finally I finished it!""YOU finished?" Merryweather said with hands on hips and a disgruntled tone. "You did not do it all alone!""Details, details..." the other said dismissively."Oh, please! Let me see! I waited months for this!" Fauna asked with bright eyes. Flora didn't deny."Let us look together and then show to Aurora. After all, this is the story of her life!"The book had an elaborate and whimsically cover drawn in high relief. The golden letters composed the title "Sleeping Beauty" along with a drawing of a young woman of rare beauty peacefully sleeping in a bed surrounded by roses. The fairies took many months to write that masterpiece, telling everything that had happened in those fateful days."'And they lived happily ever after. The end!' Oh, so beautiful!" Fauna said wiping a tear after they finish the reading. Although large , the book had more pictures than words."Will she like?" Merryweather also asked wiping her tears."What nonsense! Why would not she? Look at these wonderful drawings! And this neatly elaborate letters!"Fauna took the book again and flipped through carefully, reaching an image in particular."This picture gives me the creeps! Do you think Aurora will believe she was like that?""Of course yes! She has no reason to be suspicious about us!" Flora said taking the book back and closing. "Do not forget that everything must happen according to plan!"After leaving the horse in the stable of employees, Aurora returned to the palace with the basket full of raspberries and humming the song of her dream along with some birdsong. Her face showed clear relief and she seemed numbed. She sang with the same somber and melancholy voice.Reaching near the palace, she was silent and taken the fruits to the kitchen where made a beautiful raspberries pie for her father, as promised. Then she went to her bedroom to change clothes and before she could unbutton her dress, a voice said behind her."Want some help, dear?""No, Fauna, thanks. Something happened while I was outside?"The fairy giggled covering her mouth with a hand and answered with rosy cheeks."We have a surprise for you!""Is Philip back?""No, another surprise. We will show you after dinner. Do not be late!"The fairy left for Aurora's relief. If was Flora or Merryweather would have insisted, but Fauna was less invasive and almost always respected her desire to be alone. Thank goodness.When she take the dress off and all the underwear, Aurora saw a purplish spot on her arm. It also had some bruising on her leg and certainly on back, though she couldn't see. Heavens! She needed to be more careful next time! Fortunately the clothes covered her entire body, but things could get complicated if she showed up with a bruise on her face."I... I did it again!" her face contorted with guilt and sorrow as a few tears appeared in her eyes. She had done it again!She quickly wiped the tears and hold back the tears. Mourning was useless and despite the guilt tormenting her, she knew that within a few days was going to do the same thing again.Dinner went on normally as most dinners used to do. The king and the queen talked about Philip's visit, what Aurora waited anxiously. When they finished, the fairies came bringing a thick book and handed to the king."We're done, your majesty!" Flora said very respectfully."Oh, let me see. The cover is very beautiful!""The drawings were also beautiful!" The queen said looking at the fine pictures.The royal couple just flipped through a few pages, praised the pictures and shouted exclamations of disgust when they saw Maleficent."Is it really necessary portrait this repulsive creature?""I am sorry, Your Majesty. Everyone needs to see and know the true face of evil.""Right. I think Aurora, more than anyone, want to see this magnificent work."The young woman accepted the book willingly and when got permission to withdraw, she ran to her room, closed the door and sat at small table to finally see the pictures and read the story that was hitherto only told by the fairies. The entire kingdom knew that story, which must have also spread to the neighboring kingdom.She was specially interested about the party of her baptism, when a wicked and vengeful fairy uttered a curse to kill her."Listen well, all of you!" she read eagerly "The princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty, beloved by all who adore her." Near this quote, there was a draw of her father angry and her mother very worried. "But, before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel... And die!"A picture of the fairy filled a whole Page. She was with open arms, one hand holding a staff with a round orb on it."So that was the terrible Maleficent" she said looking at the picture of a tall and thin woman with large horns on her head. Her skin was very green and the eyes yellow with green iris. Her twisted and wrinkled face exuded pure evil. How ugly and terrible she was!Aurora had never seen her personally, so had only the descriptions given by the fairies and her parents. That's was quite strange... she looked the picture with more attention. The fairies had never talked about that too pointy chin. And was her skin so green? She looked like a leaf! And that woman was so thin that looked like a stick with horns using a large black and purple dress.The reading was normal until the time when, according to the faries, she had pricked her finger on the spindle of the spinning wheel and stopped for a while. She remembered the great sadness to know she was going to marry a strange instead Philip, the love of her life. At least was what she thought since didn't know her love was also her fiance. She leaned over a dressing table cried bitterly when a light showed up suddenly and attracted hypnotically. So some things were confusing.Try as she might, she couldn't remember the moment that pricked her finger on the spindle. She remembered just trying to touch a beautiful green light and nothing else. And everything went dark. She never said anything about hearing a voice. Why the fairies wrote that?They said her sleep was short because Philip soon came to rescue and woke her with a true love kiss. How ironic! She has been dreaming of her first kiss for so long and when finally happened, she didn't feel anything because was unconscious! After that, the couple exchanged only a few short and quick kisses because they rarely were left alone. And those few kisses never did her feel anything strong, only a slight taste of something forbidden. Did things would change after they get married?Aurora kept reading the book when saw the part about the forest of thorns. Another thing that made her full of doubts. According to the story, Philip had exceeded the thorns by cutting the plants with his sword. The thorns was large, sharp and could hurt a person easily. However, his clothes were intact and there was not a single scratch on his skin. He had nowhere near the look of someone who has been stuck in a gloomy castle dungeons, fled under rays fired by a cruel fairy, passed through a forest of thorns and fought a fierce dragon."Are you still reading this book, Aurora?" Flora said entering her room together with the other fairies. Why they never knocked on the door?"It was too complicated for you?" Merryweather also asked with worry."No, of course not. I liked it so much I read it twice!"The three gave a smile and Flora said."I am very glad you enjoyed our book. But now it is time for you to sleep! Princesses need rest. We will help you change clothes.""No, no! I do it alone, don't worry!" she ran to behind the folding screen and changed so fast that fairies didn't have time to move. They shouldn't see the bruises on her body.Her nightgown had the long sleeves and she lay down quickly not to arouse suspicion. Fauna straightened the covers and Merryweather gave her a peck on the forehead."Godmothers, I have a question..." she said before the fairies to leave."Tell us, dear.""Well... there are some things in this book I don't remember...""Of course I do not remember, my dear! You were asleep!""Well... I know that... but..."Flora fluffed her pillows and said motherly way."Do not tire your pretty little head with such nonsense! Everything you need to know is in the book and I assure that we write each fact exactly how it happened!"Aurora gulped and decided not to say anything. The fairies could get hurt if thought she doubted their story. When they blew out the candles and left, she continued traveling in her thoughts. The picture of Maleficent came back to her mind, leaving her totally intrigued by the wicked fairy.Why would someone be so offended by not being invited to a party to the point of cursing a newborn? Even if she was really so evil, doesn't it make more sense to kill or kidnap the baby?She stood up and walked to the window. The night was dark and the palace courtyard was lit by torches. Over the horizon, she saw a dense forest that fairies said was to prevent any person from the kingdom go until the Forbidden Lands. Other questions invaded her mind.According to the original curse, she should hurt a finger on the spindle and die. What a silly curse was this? If she wanted to curse someone, would have led this person to be bitten by a snake, spider or any other venomous animal. Why a spinning wheel? That made no sense!Her head hurt again. What the hell! Rather than clarify, that book has brought a multitude of questions! Tired of so much thinking, she she lay down again and soon fell asleep. Her dreams were populated by strange scenarios and half moons...

The day has dawned and Maleficent decided to take care of her daily duties still with images of that dream in her mind. She also remembered the anxiety and affliction that she felt when tried to reach the white half circle. It was as if her whole life revolved around it. She couldn't live in half. Complete circle was needed.At least she felt stronger and well prepared despite that pain in her heart from time to time. Maybe it was time to research and find out why that vital organ wasn't recovering.Her castle had a huge library, filled with books of various ages, cultures and places. Some was written in ancient and unknown languages that only she was able to understand and others could only be opened with magic . There were also books of astronomy, astrology, mathematics, geometry, alchemy and herbs, books of geography, history and philosophy. Books in various languages such as Latin, Greek, Aramaic, Chinese, Phoenician and even Egyptian parchments with those complicated hieroglyphics.The shelves almost reached the ceiling and all the books were well cared thanks to the relentless work of a librarian who handled everything very well. Books were knowledge, culture and information. And she knew very well that knowledge was power."This makes no sense!" She roared angry to see that had researched so much and found nothing. The books recommended enchantments, potions or herbs she knew were useless to her problem.She left the books on the table so that the librarian kept later and went to a terrace to look at the view of outside the castle. Did that problem had no solution or would get better with time? She put a hand on her chest in a protective gesture. What nonsense! No one was there to attack her! But it could happen in the future and she had to be prepared. Confront the enemies being vulnerable was very unwise."What stupid! I am no weak!" She pushed away any fearful thoughts and kept the focus on her return. It was only necessary know what action to take and she had an idea. Knowledge was power, right? So, before any action, she needed to know well her enemies, study them, know their habits and routines. Only then she'd know how to give them a well deserved lesson.The sun shone brightly outside and seeing its golden light, a question arose. In fact, had arisen before but she always tried to postpone. This time curiosity was stronger and she needed to take that issue to clean. It was a necessity."How the sleeping little princess is going? Hmm, think I will like to know."Several hours passed and finally the night came along with two honored guests."Welcome! Very welcome! Let us celebrate because today is a day of joy!" Stefan said with open arms to receive Hubert and Philip.All presents applauded and celebrated the return of those so important men. Aurora also vibrated with joy because her beloved come back to her. How handsome he was! Tall, strong, manly! He was the typical hero of fairy tales. Her hero.After a sumptuous banquet, the orchestra began to play music and nobody lost time. Several couples were formed and soon they're dancing. Philip drove Aurora gently, enraptured by the beauty of his bride who had grown and become more womanly."You're more beautiful than ever!" He said quietly trying to maintain the serene countenance. They were in public and such outbursts weren't allowed."Thank you..." she thanked with a sweet smile.The dance didn't allow big body contact, which was too bad for him. Having that woman in arms was causing reactions in his body. Aurora, on the other hand, didn't understand her feelings. Why didn't her heart beat irregularly nor she didn't feel that cold in the belly? Why was she glad he couldn't hold her stronger in his arms?Maybe it was the strong emotion of the reunion. Or maybe those crazy and stupid ideas that dominated her head? Those foolish suspicions were taking her happiness and she needed to put an end to that situation.At the end of the dance, taking advantage that her father was too distracted confabulating with Hubert and sipping wine, Aurora asked."Would you like take a walk in the garden? It's a beautiful night!""I'd love to!"The couple left the hall arm in arm and Aurora hoped the fairies didn't follow them. She wasn't a child in need of supervision."Then negotiations were a success?""Yes. My father and I had a lot of work, but our persistence paid off. The king declared peace and accepted a covenant with us.""Several Kingdoms united in alliance will be much stronger.""I think so, but let's forget about these matters. Today is a day to celebrate!"Her face flushed when the prince took her hand. They were alone in the middle of a beautiful garden under the stars and no one was around. Philip was approaching slowly and she closed her eyes expecting a kiss of true love. When the lips of the young man touched her, the only thing she felt was an empty within herself. Just a cold emptiness.Maleficent made an effort not to fall asleep. The princess' life was the most boring, tedious and insipid thing she had seen! In fact, she was insipid. A girl with no personality, no self-will, no attitude. Only a porcelain doll that everyone manipulated at pleasure. And she never challenged, never complained. Always smiling and accepting all orders and constraints. How could someone live like this? What a disappointment! Although expecting exactly that, she had hoped some flame was still left inside her.What a mistake... The flame had been extinguished, leaving a pale creature who only cared to follow rules and please everyone.She, on the other hand, never accepted orders or constraints of any kind. No way! She was the one who made the rules for herself and her life."Pathetic little creature. You will live the rest of your days as a puppet in the hands of others. And to think I waited too long for you! Those fairies was successful to ruin you!"That young woman became so insignificant that Maleficent decided not to worry about her. What someone so weak and without personality had to offer to the world? She decided to look inside the great hall, no mattering what else the couple was doing. Her hopes were lost and see them exchanging kisses made her stomach sick.The two kings were talking and wine was already taking effect. To her, they were just two incompetent morons."Oh, will it take long to establish democracy?" She thought. It was difficult to accept that such stupid people had the right to rule a nation just because of their royal blood. Well, it would take a lot to change. For now, she just wanted to study them to then decide what to do.The image projected onto the scepter ball faded. She wasn't interested in following a stupid party. Such events never interested. The next day, Maleficent expected more interesting things to discover."And the dragon fell from the abyss after I stabbed my sword in her chest. That's what happened.""Weren't you afraid? The fairies say she was very powerful!""A warrior can not be afraid of anything!" He said arrogantly."What happened to the dragon's body then?""She disappeared, leaving only a cape and sword."She thought for a moment and asked again."It isn't strange that such a creature has gone this way? Should at least have her body left and..."He was losing patience with so many questions and decided to end that conversation."Maleficent was defeated and everyone can live in peace now. Why bother yourself with such details, sweetheart?""But... what if she didn't die? She could have run away and...""Do you doubt my strength and the power of fairy godmothers?"Her heart tightened."I think you ask too many questions can make them hurt. Just leave the things as they are.""Leave things as they are..." she repeated in a low voice."Exactly! A bright future awaits us! Let's leave this sad past behind and start a new life. Come, we need return to the throne room before our parents send an army behind us."Leading Aurora by the arm, Philip returned to the hall happy for the conversation to be over. She was asking lots of questions and he had difficulty answering many of them.Aurora felt that uncomfortable feeling of emptiness, dissatisfaction and loneliness again. It's was hard to believe that a bright future awaited her.

The days passed and Aurora was sitting in the garden staring up at nothing. Even though the crisis has been solved, Philip was still very busy with Hubert and Stefan. All right, she didn't care. Over time, his presence was getting more and more tedious.He didn't make her feel that strong emotions like the first time, when they sang and danced together. These moments was so beautiful! What broke the enchantment? She didn't know.Everyone was excited about the big engagement party that has been scheduled for within four months because many of the guests lived in other countries and the trip used to be long and slow.Her father planned to marry them within one year from the date of the party. Just thinking about it made her body cold. Why did she feel this way? Philip was her true love! She should be happy and full of joy. So many young women was forced to marry with unknown and, often, old and ugly men. She, on the other hand, had the privilege of marry a young and handsome man who she loved and loved her."But I didn't choose him. He was chosen for me. And if one day I change my mind? No one will hear me. Nobody cares about what I think."A wave of sadness flooded her body. Hard and sad truth. Nobody cared about her thoughts. Everyone treated her like a small child, who needed to be cared all time and couldn't make her own decisions. Her life was controlled by everyone but herself.A bitter taste invaded her mouth. She wasn't a small and helpless child. Her heart cried out for freedom and independence, but his parents offered her a prison from which she didn't dare even try to escape. No, if she do that will  hurt the feelings of those who loved her. But she could have her secrets. Yes she could!After a few days of observation, Maleficent knew exactly what and how to do. It was time to show who was in power and those idiots were about to learn how to give her the respect she deserved. "They will regret for what they did and what they stole from me!"Yes, they had stolen something very important. Her half. The pain of loss will haunt her for many decades until she could get another chance. This offense couldn't go unpunished.The meeting with Stefan, Hubert and ministers of the court was closed. They planned to have a big party to announce wedding date of the insipid Princess with the moron prince."Surely I can not miss this party." She muttered sarcastically. "It would be rude of me!"She ran a hand on the ball of scepter and another image was focused."Oh, no! This insipid creature again!" She said wearily.The fairy was about to erase the image when something caught her eye."What is she doing?" She asked to see the princess going to the forest riding a very poor and ugly horse. What a horror! She would rather to walk on her own feet than ride that animal full of fleas! Fortunately, she didn't need any means of transport.When arrived near a large hollow tree, Aurora tied the horse on a stump, took of it bag and headed for the bushes. Maleficent decided to keep looking. That princess made her curious.Minutes later, a completely different person appeared. It was a sad and grotesque figure of a little man dressed in poor rags. No... it wasn't a man. It was the princess!"This promises to be very interesting!"Her long blond hair was braided and firmly fastened at the top of the head in order to make the smallest volume as possible. She put an ugly and disheveled wig and also a big hat. Her appearance was unrecognizable. Then she rode the horse and went into the forest.After walking for a while, she reached a small dirt road and Maleficent saw that she was going to the village. What she wanted do in the village and why she was dressed so ridiculous like that?Aurora kept going without being bothered by anyone. After all, who would care for a wanderer? Maleficent still had to wait for over half an hour until the princess reaches the poorest part of village. Finally, she arrived at a tavern, tied the horse along with others and come in."A princess inside a tavern? This filthy place? I need to see this!"She, disguised as a wanderer, came up to the counter where a fat man with a beard served customers."I wanna beer and also bread and cheese." The young woman said with rough voice showing three coins.A coarse clay cup with shoddy beer was placed over the greasy wooden counter, along with a piece of black bread and cheese of dubious origin. Maleficent didn't contain a grimace of disgust. Would she actually eat that? And drink beer? What nonsense! There were much better and more exquisite food in the palace!Aurora didn't seem to bother with the filth and ate everything hungrily. Other men also drank, chattered and spoke obscene words while playing cards. She soon joined them.Since when the princess knew how to play cards? And since when she had adopted that vulgar language? Why was she acting that way? And how Maleficent hadn't noticed before?The men yelled and Aurora didn't fall behind. She had won the game and picked up the coins with a big smile of satisfaction."You had a good game today, didn't you?" A woman said seductively showing her generous cleavage. No matter if the man was ugly, skinny and filthy. Money was money."It was a good day. Do you want one?" She asked showing a coin, causing the woman's eyes shone.More than fast, they walked away and went to the back of the tavern. Maleficent knew very well what was that woman's livelihood, but couldn't understand why Aurora has left with her. Unless...The back of the tavern was a dirty, stinking and messy place. There were other couples there doing things that was supposed to be done only between four walls. Aurora pressed woman against the wall and glued her lips to hers.It was very rare to happen, but this time Maleficent was totally taken by surprise. A glass of wine she was holding between her fingers fell to the floor, staining the carpet with red. Was she really seeing that? The princess kissing another woman as if to devour her? What the hell was going on? The world had turned upside down and nobody told her?"Do you want me to be nice?" She said putting her hands where are supposed be male genitals that Aurora hadn't. The princess pulled the woman's hand away and said."I'll be good to you, sweety!" She turned to kiss a woman, squeezing her breasts and fondling her private parts. That madness lasted a few minutes and then Aurora turned away in silence and returned to the tavern. "More beer!" She asked and continued drinking alone.The woman soon got another customer willing to pay for her services. Aurora kept drinking and when finished the cup, she decided bring more emotion the place."You idiot, the woman is still with me!" She said clenching the fists. The man stood up abruptly dropping the chair and rushed against her, which nimbly swerved and punched him in the stomach.The other men soon got excited and began exchanging punches between them. Aurora fought frantically, broke chairs on the opponents' heads, gave and received punches. She just was careful not to get any blow on to her face.The fight didn't last long and soon everyone was singing and dancing. Maleficent watched wondering if she was the right princess. Yes, it was Aurora. But not the insipid and bland Aurora she knew.The evening was falling when she was gone and the way back was peaceful and uneventful. She bought strawberries from a peasant woman and come back to the palace singing a song that filled Maleficent of shivers. Not by the lyric, which was silly and childish for her, but by the way the princess sang. Actually, she liked that way to sing.The rest was simple. She changed her clothes, put the horse in the stables of the employees and returned to the palace as if nothing had happened. Since nothing interesting happened, Maleficent erased the images still stunned by what had just seen."She is not as insipid as I thought. Interesting, very interesting!"

After dinner, Aurora ran into her bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed. Suddenly, she felt as if she had awakened from a stupor or great intoxication."I did it again! I did! Again! This couldn't have happened!"That was maddening. She always promised herself several times that would never do that and fews days later she did the same folly. What if something bad had happened to her? She could have been killed! When she come back to palace, the fairies scolded her lightly because of the delay and didn't suspect anything. Her face was clean, the clothes immaculate and hair neatly tied atop her head. Her angelic face showed no guilt or fear.But now, alone in her bedroom and with time to think about what she had done, Aurora felt the weight of guilt. What did her parents say if they saw her in that situation? They were going to be very disappointed. The fairies could cry of sorrow and grief and Philip would never want to see her again. The entire kingdom would revolt because of that shame.And despite all that guilt, she felt alive. How could anyone feel so good after doing obscene things? How can she kiss another woman like that? How she was able to let that madness came to that point?That was supposed to be just a little adventure and nothing else. She was barely seventeen, Philip had gone with his father to his kingdom and she just waited for him to come back without major concerns. Everything has begun when she wanted to make a blueberry pie for her father and went to the forest to pick fresh fruits. After walking, she reached a road and followed it riding a horse until reach the village. Then she realized she had gone too away from the palace disobeying her parents' orders.But everything seemed so fascinating! They only used to pass through the village in carriages and she could saw only through the small window. Riding by horse she was able to see people, shops, vendors, everything. Aurora forgot the risk she was taking and decided to do a brief tour. It was when she reached the poorest part of village and was afraid to move forward. What was there? Why her father's carriage never came to that place?People with dirty appearance walked all over and looked at her strangely and she was afraid. She wanted to know that place, but feared for her safety and so quickly returned to the palace thinking of a way to walk through around there safely.The idea came unexpectedly when the royal family was doing a small trip towards the house of a duke. Aurora saw a man with very poor appearance walking down the road riding a thin and dirty horse. This vision aroused a crazy idea. A princess walking along the poorest part of village could draw attention, but no one would care about a poor man. The idea was great! With a good disguise, no one realized who she was. So it would be easier to walk freely without being hassled. Then she put this plan into action when had a chance and loved every minute.She was free! Free of rules, restrictions, without anyone telling her what to do! When passing near that tavern, she was attracted by tuneless singing of customers and eventually entered. Not long after, she learned to feel comfortable there. She watched other men and saw how they talked, behaved, what they ate and drank. And also saw how they fought, cursed and practiced obscene acts that a princess shouldn't ever see.She noticed that from time to time, some couples used to go to the back of the tavern and one day she decided to find out what they were doing there. She gave a coin to a woman and when they went to the back of tavern, Aurora was shocked by what she saw. Couples had sex animalishly, emitting sounds that her ears had never heard before. Some were completely naked without bothering with each other.Then it happened. The woman pushed her to the wall and kissed her. Aurora was taken by surprise and the first impulse was to push her away. She had never been kissed by anyone else besides Philip, let alone by another woman! However, that was more enjoyable than she thought. It was more physical, adrenaline, fear, feeling of doing something forbidden, transgress the rules. Then she tried this new emotion despite couldn't do with that woman the same as the other couples. At least it was a new emotion.Over time, Aurora learned to fight and behave like a man. She even made some friends who talked to her about their own life and taught some tricks to survive in a cold, cruel world.She remembered when she met a very skilled thief. He almost stole her coin purse! His specialty, however, was to invade homes. He was able to unlocked locks and padlocks with an amazing ability and accepted to teach her in exchange for a few coins.With another, she learned to play cards and even some tricks to cheat. She learned to steal money from people's pockets without them noticing. And of course, she also learned to run away when the fights became more serious. Nobody was able to reach her.This experience taught her to be cleverer, creative and not naively believe in everything. People could be liars and cheaters. Within months, she learned more about life than the sixteen years living with her fairy godmothers.But things were escaping her control. She sank deeper and deeper into that world of debauchery. And there was no way to stop that  overpowering impulse that from time to time became unmanageable to the point she could no longer control her actions.At those moments, it was like other personality dominated her. When wearing those clothes and rode that poor horse, she was no longer Aurora. She was an ordinary people's man and could go and do whatever she wanted. That was why she couldn't stop. After living always surrounded with so many rules, her heart longed for a bit of freedom and she couldn't deny."Are you fine, honey?" Flora asked invading her bedroom with the other fairies."Did Philip like my pie?""Sure, he ate two pieces!" Merryweather replied smiling. Aurora seemed so concerned to please her future fiancé!"How nice!""Sleep now, my darling! And have good dreams!"Aurora changed clothes and settled under the covers recalling her adventure that day. No, there was no stopping. While she continued living that suffocating life, the need for liberation was going to continue pounding in her chest. Try as she might, she wouldn't be able to give this strange addiction.In her private chamber, lying on bed, Maleficent recalled the strange events she had witnessed that day. Why she hadn't noticed this strange behavior? Maybe because the princess looked so boring that she no longer cared to watch her. It was a mistake. That young woman had a dark side that no one that palace knew. What else was hiding behind that angelical face?"Maybe I should keep an eye on her. Maybe ... for now, I have other matters to attend to."

"Two dragons? Did you kill two dragons today?" Stefan asked incredulously while Hubert congratulated his son for the great feat."That's right! I nipped the evil in the bud!"Aurora heard them with her heart in pain."You nipped the evil in the bud?" she asked with low voice. Philip replied proudly."Look at this!"The servants showed her two little dragons lying dead over a large tray. They were no bigger than her forearm and seemed harmless. They had long thin body that seemed quite flexible. One was white as snow with green and golden spots scattered throughout the body. The other one was reddish with black and purple wings. Both looked like small works of art and now were dead. Why Philip killed so little dragons? How could anyone be so cruel?Her heart broke at the same time and tears formed in her eyes."Is there something wrong, Aurora?" The king asked finding odd the reaction of his daughter."Why'd you do that?" She asked the prince. "They were just babies and didn't offer any danger! Why were you so cruel?"Everyone was silent with that so unusual reaction from the princess. The man was disconcerted by her inquisitive look and tried to defend his actions."They're babies now, but one day will grow and destroy everything around!" "They haven't had the chance to defend themselves!" "Dragons don't give us a chance to defend ourselves!" "But...""Enough, Aurora! What behavior is that? Please behave yourself!" Her mother chided, being supported by her father."Philip is a great hero. Do not forget he had to defeat a big dragon to defend you. Show a little more respect!"The fairies didn't defend her either."I think you must apologize, my dear!" Flora spoke to her ear and Aurora wanted to scream with rage. However, she just lowered her head and said."I'm apologize, Philip. I don't know what got into me.""Apology accepted." The young man said with arrogance."Come on! She is just an inexperienced young woman! You know that women tend to have weak head!" Hubert said trying to undo that unpleasant atmosphere and before long the incident was forgotten.

Maleficent didn't want see anything else. After all, that little princess was still weak and pathetic. She was only brave against a bunch of drunk commoners, but when she had to take a true action, she stepped back scared to death! There was no way to respect such a weak and cowardly human.Moreover, she was very angry with that bastard prince who had killed two gorgeous dragons without the slightest pity and even boasted that act of cowardice! No, she couldn't let him go unpunished no way! More than ever, she was willing to go back and put those idiots in their places. Nevermore anyone was going to hurt a dragon again."He'll pay dearly for this crime, I swear!" She said shooting rays with scepter to vent the anger. "Everyone will pay me dearly!"

The dragons were placed in a room by servants. Later, they were going be stuffed and displayed as a trophy by Philip. Without anyone to see, Aurora come into the room with her face bathed in tears and caressed the little corpses."I'm sorry, I'm really sorry! He shouldn't have done that! What cruelty!"Fight against a wicked fairy in dragon form was one thing. Killing defenseless babies was quite another and she couldn't believe that one day was able to love such cold and cowardly man. All the feelings she still had disappeared in a few moments. But she was still forced to share her life and her bed with him.More than ever, Aurora felt the urge to get away and take the free and independent life she always dreamed of. But the fear was stronger. How to make a living? She didn't know how to provide for herself and there were no good job opportunities for women. Alone and with no one to look after her, Aurora was going to starve to death. Then her heart ached and bled. It hurt by the miserable life that was about to take, hurt by small dragons and by the feeling of living a lie. There was no hope for her.Her eyes turned back to the small corpses and Aurora caressed them slowly while apologized. One of them, the red dragon, still had the warm body and was breathing weakly. He was cut by a knife and the wound was too severe. Without thinking twice, she took the dragon with her hands wondering if was possible to do something to help the little creature.The dragon opened the violet eyes and looked at her as if asking something. She put it back on the table and the creature emitted a faint sound, as if making an effort and soon Aurora saw an egg of the size of a walnut out of its body. Those dragons weren't babies as she thought and one was a pregnant female!After this extra effort, the poor creature died, leaving her heart more broken than it was. The egg lay on the table and Aurora took it with trembling hands. It was still hot, but she knew there was no way hatch it without mother's help. Maybe... Could she do the job herself?What was to be done? How to do?"Heat! It needs heat. Let me see..." She looked her clothes and decided to put it inside the cleavage. It was warm, safe and the egg was to small to be noticed. There were chances of it working? She didn't know, but felt that should do something for the poor dragon. This was going to be another of her secrets.A month later, Aurora still carried the dragon's egg inside her cleavage. No one had noticed, thankfully. Her escapes to the village had just finished because she didn't want to risk breaking the egg and kill the little dragon. It needed constant care. Although the egg was keep warm, she sometimes doubted whether was doing it right. How to care for a dragon? No books in the library could help her and fairies don't knew answer her questions. And she couldn't tell anyone she had a dragon egg inside her cleavage."Are you impressed with the dragons killed by Philip, dear? Don't worry about it!" Fauna said trying to reassure her."I'm just curious. There is no book in the library talking about dragons. Why?""Because these books are rare and nobody is interested in studying dragons. Only to kill them.""Is there any expert?"Fauna hesitated, scratched her chin with the magic wand and said in a low voice."As far I remember, Maleficent was great expert in dragons and knew all about them. But she's dead, you know.""Yes, she is..." Aurora said disappointed. It was crazy, but for a moment she wished the wicked fairy was alive.Find those little dragons made her interest in these creatures further increase, which was frustrating because of the limited information available."Princesses don't care about dragons. Leave this matter aside.""I just wanted to learn more. Sometimes I think it has so many hidden things which no one ever told me!"The green fairy made sure no one was listening and said."Sometimes people hide things because it’s convenient for them. Trying to discover it can cause a lot of discomfort and problems. Let it go and live your life. It will be better for you and for everyone." She shook her wand a few times, dropping a green glow and left the room leaving Aurora with her thoughts. That green glow... what a strange thing! She knew that glow from somewhere!

If she was so perfect and graceful, why the hell she had to study etiquette? Aurora was footsore after walking from one side to another balancing books on head. She also had to learn how to be a good wife and received constants lessons as she should always be gentle, submissive and meek."Prince Philip'll take the throne one day and as queen, your role will be support him. The queen must always walk two steps behind the king as a sign of respect and..."Her stomach churned with anger every time this lesson was said. She was the daughter of the king and was supposed take the throne, not any moron of a neighboring kingdom. But she couldn't say anything. Only obey with a beautiful smile.Aurora entered the bedroom and took off shoes to relieve the pain in feet. She never liked shoes and missed the time she could walk barefoot through the forest. A little creature came towards coiling around her neck."Hi, Oscar! Did you miss me? I want a kiss!" The dragon gave a slight growl stroking her face with his head and licked her lips with his forked tongue. He had grown considerably and was about the size of her forearm. It was a beautiful dragon with golden-yellow scales that became orange gradually toward the legs. His wings had the same pattern and he was very docile and obedient.It all started when she was singing and playing harp for her parents, father in law and fiancé. Aurora sang with the voice of an angel and masterfully playing the instrument when she felt something moving in her cleavage. The song was briefly interrupted. She tried to keep singing and another movement caused her to detune a bit, drawing the attention of those present."Are you fine, Aurora?" Asked the fairies and she tried not squirm too much because the movement between her breasts."Yes, I'm fine..." she giggled, then covered her mouth with a hand and asked. "Please I think I don't feel very well. Can I withdraw? I apologize."Her parents looked at each other and the king replied."Yes, you can withdraw."She made an awkward reverence and went away hurriedly. Upon arriving in her bedroom, she ran behind the folding screen and sat on the floor with the back against the wall. So she unbuttoned the dress and saw, climbing on her skin, a tiny newly hatched dragon. He was the size of a gecko and seemed the most delicate thing in the world.The princess still remembered that day with joy to know that has been capable of caring for a living being. Since then, she has been dedicated to taking care of him the best way possible. Oscar ate fruits and occasionally insects that appeared in the room. He also enjoyed some leaves and tree sap. Then feed him was easy. Over time he grew quickly and learned to stay hidden under her clothes or hair. Otherwise he was well hidden in the bedroom to not be seen by anyone."Oh, Oscar, I'm so tired of it all!" She said sitting on a couch with her little friend on lap. He was the only living being in the world that listen her without judging. "I wish could escape to far away. I don't want to marry Philip! And there's still that mystery I can't solve. What are everyone hiding from me?"She tried to ask to whose are present at baptism and no one answered nothing. It was as if they were afraid to speak. Fairies just said that all truth was in the book. Her parents and Philip were impossible to talk. They would never reveal anything even though if  they knew. So what was left to her? Where investigate?"If only someone could tell me something... but who? Oh, wait! I think I know!"Her body was stronger than ever, except her heart, the most vital part. What most inconvenient thing! Why precisely that part isn't healed? It didn't matter at the moment. Maleficent didn't want to wait for complete healing, which could take many years. It was a few days for the party and she was more than ready to put her plan into action.Her glances at the palace showed that many people were invited, which was perfect. The more witnesses, the better.The first to be humiliated was that idiot prince. Because of what he've done to the dragons, he became the target of her greatest hate, more than the three fairies. After finishing him, she intended to give a lesson to the king and queen for them to learn to respect her.She was so busy with preparations that aren't more interested in spying on the castle and much less Aurora, the weakest person she had known. The gift given by the fairies had done effect and there was nothing she could do.If her memory served her right, the gift had been given by the blue fairy, Merryweather. The same one that had turned her crow into stone. That insignificant little creature was going to suffer her wrath as well.On the table was a half bottle of wine and a cup. The lutist was singing with slurred voice awkwardly playing his instrument. Aurora listened and clapped like she was enjoying the show. As everyone was too busy with the preparations for the party, she asked permission for the lutist sing some songs to her."He's so funny and will entertain me!" She asked with an angelical face, like a small child asking for a candy. Nobody could say no and there was the lutist slightly drunk acting so ridiculous. The visits to the tavern taught her that people always talked too much when they were drunk. Many secrets and confessions were told with great ease."Oh, how beautiful! Now tell me the history of my baptism! I want to hear!""The baptism of the beautiful princessWith golden hairRed lips like a rose!Born from the King and QueenThe daughter expected by everyone in the kingdom!"It was far from a beautiful song. The man staggered, sang with bundled voice and not bother to rhyming verses. He took another sip from the cup and continued singing."Then came three fairies from afarTo give you gifts (hic!)The first fairy gave her the gift of beautyThe second the gift of songAnd the third... the third... (hic!)"His voice balled up further and Aurora couldn't understand what he was saying."What a gift the third fairy gave to the child?""Then came the wicked fairy Maleficent (hic!)""And did she curse the child?" Aurora interrupted.The lutist emptied the wine cup and held it in the air, indicating that it was to be filled. Aurora wasted no time and asked again."Did she curse the baby?"She had to wait he drank a few sips, dry off his mouth, turning the instrument and finally continued."She gave the child a giftA special giftThat sparkled under the lights...""And the curse? I was going to die at sixteen?"He stopped singing, put the instrument on one shoulder and spoke taking more wine."Curse? Die? I don't remember any of that! (Hic!)""She said when I turned sixteen, I was going to jab my finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die.""She didn't say anything about spinning wheel!""So what did she say?""He said... said... what she said? She put something in your crib and said... ""What did she put in my crib?""A half a moon! It was a scandal, a scandal! Everyone was terrified!""And what did she say?" She asked trying not to lose patience."Half moon , half, complement... (hic) the king and queen were terrified!"He returned to play the instrument and sang tuneless way, not saying anything that made sense. The bottle was emptied and Aurora dismissed him before he lost consciousness and slept in her bedroom. The lutist came out singing like a drunk and fell anywhere to sleep. Oscar came out of his hiding and landed over her lap."Half a moon... maybe..." the only thing that came to her mind was a half moon of her dreams. That would have been the gift given by Maleficent? What she had said to let everyone panicked? And most importantly, why they distorted the whole story to make it appear she had cursed her? What was happening?Well... maybe she could call the lutist other day, when she could steal more wine from her father's private cellar. Oscar got up from her lap and quickly flew to his hideout. This was a sign that someone was coming. In short time, the three fairies entered the room chattering about the tasks that Aurora still needed to do that day. She made no objection and followed the godmothers wishing she have met the wicked fairy.Was she so evil as everyone said?

The palace was decorated for the big engagement party. Important people came from all over the kingdom and also from neighboring countries.Inside her bedroom, Aurora got dressed with fairy godmothers' help. After a long discussion between Flora and Merryweather about the color of the dress, they finally come into an agreement: blue with pink flowers. The dress had a square neckline, tight sleeves that covered the back of the hands like gloves and external wide sleeve with an opening on the side that showed the arms. The external skirt was blue with pink roses and the internal, showed by a open of external skirt, was pink. The colors were beautiful and vibrant, which was possible thanks to magic. It wasn't possible to have fabrics with such colors using conventional methods.Over her head, a golden crown with a veil falling until half of back. Around the neck, a necklace of gold and sapphires. She was really dressed like a princess.(Flora) "How beautiful you are!"(Merryweather )"A beautiful princess!"(Fauna) "Philip will love. He is the luckiest man on earth."Her eyes filled with tears and Fauna hastened to give her a handkerchief."See how she is thrilled. Please, darling, do not smudge your makeup!"They never imagined that Aurora felt like she had a thorn gradually being spiked in her heart. No, she didn't want to marry that man no way. There was no more love, if it ever was.But she was trapped. The fairies had told her that the marriage was going to prevent the Philip's kingdom was invaded and conquered. If that happened, the conquering king would be stronger and also invade her kingdom, which could be a tragedy.That was why Aurora didn't dare protest. It wasn't fair everybody suffer with a war because of her sorrows. So the only alternative was offer herself in sacrifice on behalf of kingdom and live forever condemned to hiding her sadness and loneliness.When they saw Aurora was ready, the fairies withdrew to give her some time alone. Oscar came out from his hiding and landed on her lap, looking at his owner sadly. He was the one who really understood her suffering."I'd die right now if I could! Marry this asshole is the worst curse to me!"The little dragon spit fire showing his indignation. He'd love burn the butt of that idiot! But there was nothing to be done. Her sentence was final.Everything was ready and Maleficent didn't want to wait. It was time to show all those idiots who was in charge of everything."My victory awaits me." Out of habit, she looked at the shoulder just to remember her crow was no longer with her. That blue fairy had turned him in stone and she couldn't reverse the spell because it had been too long. "A little of it is for you, my dear."Night was falling and she knew the party had already started. All the guests were gathered, as well as the fairies and the royal family."Well, I shall hurry up. It is not polite to be late!""Princess Aurora has arrived!" The herald announced when the princess entered the Great Hall followed by the fairies. Everyone was amazed and enraptured with such beauty, whose fame traveled several kingdoms. Yes, she was so beautiful and wonderful as the stories has told. No one was disappointed.Philip looked at her also admired and feeling victorious. He was on top of the world and nothing could stop him. A beautiful wife, a rich and prosperous kingdom, power and wealth. What more could he want?Aurora smiled at everyone, internally feeling the huge urge to scream and punch Philip furiously. No, a princess shouldn't do such things. Especially when her kingdom and neighbors kingdoms  were in danger of being invaded by a greedy conqueror. It was up to her to sacrifice herself for the good of everyone. She sat at the third seat next to the Queen. The orchestra played a beautiful song and everyone enjoyed gladly, unaware that their happiness was due to the princess's sacrifice."Are you fine, honey?" Merryweather asked serving some wine. Fauna held a tray containing fruits and Flora shook with a fan. All fairies surrounded her suffocatingly, ensuring that she was happy at any cost. Aurora didn't answer anything but was breathing hard as if had a huge weight over her chest.At one point in the party, the king stood up. The orchestra stopped playing and all eyes turned to the royal family. Philip approached the throne and waited for the announcement."My loyal subjects, allies and friends! Right now I want to announce the marriage of my daughter Princess Aurora with Prince Philip!"Applause and congratulations came from everywhere. When there was silence again, the king continued."The wedding will be celebrated one year from now! Nothing brings us more joy and pride than to see these two youths united in marriage! From this day on, our kingdoms will live in peace and harmony!"More applause while Aurora just felt like dying. It was fair she had to sacrifice herself for everyone? Why so much weight had to fall over her shoulders? A nudge of Flora brought her back to reality and she stood up to see that Philip had approached the throne.He took her hand and kissed gently, causing her shivers of disgust. The orchestra resumed the music and Philip led her to the middle of the hall where the guests made room for couple dancing.Then a great wind blew everywhere erasing the candles and dropping the party decoration. It was a cold wind that caused chills. In the center of the room a green light appeared and grew to materialize in the worst nightmare of everyone.The king stood up with wide eyes, the fairies panicked and Philip froze with fear. Heavens, not again! Aurora only watched everything with curiosity, feeling no fear or apprehension."Well, what have we here? What a beautiful party!" A voice spoke calmly and menacingly. "And I, once again, I wasn't invited. How careless you are!"Aurora stared, mesmerized by the tall and powerful woman who had materialized in the middle of the hall. Maleficent also saw her and the two looked at each other for a few seconds. They both felt their hearts beat differently, but none of them understood that."What are you doing here? How dare you?" The king said trying to hide the fear. She looked away from Aurora and answered keeping the firm and defiant stance."After so much time away, are not you glad to see me?" She said walking at slow and steady steps toward the thrones.Aurora couldn't look away. That woman inspired a mixture of awe and fascination, it was difficult to define. Only her presence intimidated everyone. However, her appearance was very different from the one showed in that book and she had absolutely sure that everyone had lied about many things.Fairies come between her and the thrones and Flora said."Do you still want to torment us?""No, I just came to settle some things. By the way... where is the fiancé? Ah, there he is! Let us talk for one moment. Outside!"Maleficent threw a thunderbolt against Philip, making him disappear into thin air. She also disappeared, leaving everyone terrified. Only Aurora felt happy and hoped he was gone forever."Outside! A huge dragon!" Everyone ran out, including Aurora.In the courtyard of the palace, Philip trembled with fear at the huge black and purple dragon who stood before him."Is there a problem, prince?" One voice, which was a mixture of female voice with something monstrous, said. "Where's your courage? Do not you want to give me the pleasure of this rematch? Come on, fight!""No, please! Let's talk!" He screamed terrified. "Somebody help me!"The fairies ran to help him and Flora shouted angrily."You evil, how dare you ruin such a special moment for all of us?""Out of the way, for now the matter is with him!""No way, we will defend him at all costs!"Aurora watched all feeling in the middle of a strange dream. She felt no fear, distress or anxiety."Why are you scared? Did not he beat me once? Then he can repeat the feat without problems, right?""Please, prince! Kill this dragon!" Someone in the crowd asked and soon everyone was asking him to fight."Yes, kill the dragon!" Maleficent said sarcastically. "Fight!"A green fire was shot toward the young man who jumped terrified trying to escape the flames.Seeing that there was no other option, the fairies gave him again the shield and enchanted sword. Without that, he had no chance."You have done enough. Now get out of my face!" The dragon flapped her wings, throwing the fairies away. Philip held the arms trembling of fear. Had he to go through that nightmare again? He had barely survived the previous!An unpleasant flashback crossed his mind and the prince remembered the fear he felt when he went to the cabin that Aurora had indicated to him just to be captured by weird creatures and a wicked fairy. After he fled the castle with much difficulty thanks to the good fairies, who also helped him through the forest of thorns and finally defeat the dragon. Alone, he wouldn't have done anything.Another blast of fire was shot and he protected himself with shield."Will not you use your sword? It is very powerful! What? Are you afraid?"The dragon stood in front of him and he decided not to waste time. If he could do it once, he could do again. Without thinking twice, he threw sword against the dragon aiming right in her chest. Maleficent knew she was taking a big risk because if the sword hit her, it was the end of everything. She would die again and so never have the respect of anyone. The sword seemed to fly in slow motion towards her. What had actually happened? She didn't know. For a moment, she lost concentration to see Aurora in the crowd. Why that insipid princess distracted her that way?This little distraction was enough for her dragon paws couldn't catch the sword, which inveighed against her chest and for a moment she thought everything was over. Everybody screamed, Philip almost tore his hair in despair and the fairies took her hands to her mouth to contain an exclamation of horror. A few inches away from her heart, the sword struck against something and fell to the ground as if it had been burned.If that surprised Maleficent, the surprise was even greater for other people, especially the fairies. She soon recovered her presence of mind and laughed."You idiot! Did you really thought you could defeat me this time? Of course not! I am powerful and invincible! I have overcome death and I am stronger than ever! Now, where were we? Oh, yes!"She attacked Philip again, spitting fire and trying to stomp him. Nobody had the courage to react. If he, the great hero, couldn't face that beast, then nobody could.Seeing she was reaching her goal, Maleficent decided to execute the next step of the plan to giving a strong kick knocking Philip to the ground. The shield fell away and she held him in her claws. He screamed, cried and begged for his life."What did you said? Speak louder, I can not hear. Shut up!" She growled at the crowd and then ordered shaking him hard. "Do you want die like a warrior or live like a coward? Choose!""No, please, I don't want to die!""So why had you the audacity to face me?""The fairies! They forced me! It's all their fault! I have nothing against you, please don't kill me!"It was the most pathetic thing in the world and Aurora shook her head. She already knew he was an idiot, weak and coward. But having it wide open in front of everyone was regrettable. Well... she didn't cared. After that sad scene, the wedding was canceled forever."Do you beg for your life?""I beg you, please! I'll do anything! Don't kill me! Look, kill Aurora! You wanted to curse her the whole time, didn't you? Look her right there!"For a moment, Maleficent felt the urge to crush him really. Yes, she wanted to humiliate the idiot in front of everyone, but that act of cowardice was one of the lowest things he could have done."You are so pathetic I am not going to dirty my hands with your nasty blood! You are worthless! So I will let you live with this shame. The choice was made. Live like a coward!"She released him and he ran away crying like a child. The whole crowd booed and threw things against that cowardly prince.The smile of satisfaction from Aurora's face to see that idiot being humiliated wasn't unnoticed by Maleficent, but she had other things to do."This was so fun! I guess I should thank my hosts!" She said turning her attention to the king and queen. At that time, Aurora awoke from her torpor. Humiliate Philip was good, but she wasn’t going to allow that dragon hurt her parents. 

Maleficent rushed against the couple, moving away the guards that tried to protect them and grabbed each one with a paw."I will take you to my castle now. You will spend a good season in my dungeon!""Put them down!" yelled a voice, and she looked down to see Aurora trying to kick and punch one of her paws. She just pulled the paw back and quickly took flight, rising several feet off the ground.Aurora kept yelling and asking for Maleficent to set them free, but her pleas were ignored. It was like she wasn't even there."Let them go now!" Fairies ordered."Who do you think you are to order me around? You deserve a lesson!" She let out a green ray from her mouth. The other two fairies was quick to deflect, but Merryweather was turned to stone at once. "That is for you to learn to respect me! I will never accept any insult again, ever!"That said, she went flying away and soon disappeared in the sky carrying the king and queen screaming in terror. Aurora also screamed and cried calling for her parents and fell on knees feeling more helpless than ever. Her parents were kidnapped, her subjects ran great danger and she couldn't do anything.Flora and Fauna also wept before Merryweather, which had been turned into stone.(Fauna) "Oh, poor dear! What will we do?"(Flora) "We have to reverse this spell quickly! Let's get her inside!"Two maids helped Aurora to get up and took her to her bedroom. The guests were dispersing and the ministers agreed to convene an emergency meeting to decide what to do.With less than twenty minutes of flight, Maleficent reached her castle where some guards waited at the courtyard. She put the prisoners on the ground, turned into to her original form and ordered."Take them to the dungeon! They will be my guests for a long time!"The king and queen were taken and their cries and pleas was totally ignored. Her plan had gone better than expected despite she didn't have the slightest idea what was that mysterious shield that protected her heart. What kind of magic was that? She had never heard about anything like that.Once the couple were arrested and they weren't going to cause problems, she decided to go to the library to search about that subject. Of course that magic came in handy. Without it, she would be dead and humiliated. But it was necessary know what was that and so be able to control. That magic was very powerful and power was never enough for her.Aurora cried uncontrollably with Oscar curled up around her neck trying to comfort her. There wasn't much that a small dragon as he could do."What will she do with my parents, Oscar? Will She kill them? This can't happen! I have to do something. But what?"Meanwhile, ministers and generals debated trying to resolve the crisis. The most obvious solution was to gather an army to rescue the king and queen, but most of soldiers wasn't brave enough to invade the forbidden lands and face Maleficent, which was stronger than ever. If prince Philip couldn't defeat her, so nobody could. The fairies were also easily defeated .Aurora wanted to join and was kindly asked to leave because it was a matter of men, not princesses. Why she couldn't decide about the fate of her kingdom? Just for being a woman?She was very scared and didn't know what to do. Maybe everyone was right. A woman couldn't take care of complicated and dangerous issues. They were too weak, too stupid."Why women are so weak? Nobody takes me seriously because I'm a woman! If I were a man, I would be attending the meeting with the ministers! Even Maleficent doesn't take me seriously! She acted like I don't exist!"Remember how she had been ignored by the fairy made her blood boil. She was tired of being treated like a helpless child. Nobody respected her!Throughout her life, everyone made decisions without hear her, not taking into account what she thought or felt. Everyone underestimated her and thought she was weak. But she wasn't weak, foolish or stupid. No way!Aurora took the crown off the head, the jewelry and wiped the blurred makeup from her face. She was tired of being seen as a fragile, delicate and spoiled princess. It didn't matter if she was a woman nor what those morons thought of women. She knew her own strength, knew what she was able to do and was determined to never allow anyone control her life again. It was time to, the same way as Maleficent, make her own rules."You know what, Oscar? I'll rescue my parents by myself and I don't intend to return without them!"Oscar curled up on her neck again, supporting her. It was too late and she decided to sleep to rest. The next day promised to be long and exhausting.After spending half the night searching, Maleficent felt tired and frustrated for not having found anything enlightening. Well, that could wait for now. After all, there were two guests who needed her attention and she couldn't be a bad hostess.Before break of day, she went to the dungeon followed by a guard. Inside the cell, the couple slept in an uncomfortable bed trying to confort each other. She opened the door and entered, causing them tremble with fear."Please, have mercy!" Begged the king embracing his wife."I have no intention of killing you. No, you will only spend some time in this dungeon until learn how to respect me!""We... we respect you!""No! You are just scared! I demand respect! For many years, you saw me as a pest, a nuisance and never realized my real importance. It ends now!"The last word was uttered as a scream, causing them to tremble even more."Do you know Why no one ever invaded this kingdom? Because of me! Everyone knows that to invade this kingdom, will have to face me. I would be able to protect this kingdom and this is how you show gratitude?""We are very sorry, we didn't know!""I tried to give something special to your daughter, but I was treated like a rat, insulted and expelled!""But we do not...""Enough! You have altered the natural order of things and now will suffer the consequences!""Forgive us, please! We will do anything!"Maleficent turned her back on them and left the cell."You will spend a few more days to think about everything I told you. Only then I will think if let you go or not. You need to learn that life has its own laws that should not be challenged."Having said this, she went away leaving them with their lamentations.The days passed and no one had the courage to do anything. Go through the forest that separated the kingdom of the Prohibited Lands was, by itself, a great challenge. Then they had to venture a hostile, dangerous, horrible and deadly place. Not even the bravest men had the courage to do so.Aurora was studying frontier map carefully. She knew the big forest was very dense and impenetrable because it had been created by the fairies to prevent people from venturing the Maleficent's domains. What a strange thing... the most logical was the forest have been created to protect the kingdom. However, the goal was to not let people go out of the kingdom. Another mystery she didn't understand.Fauna entered the room carrying a tray of food."How is Merryweather?""We are managing to reverse the spell, thank goodness.""I thought Maleficent's magic is too powerful for you to revert.""Bring back to life people who have had turned into stone is very basic. Any fairy can do it, but only if do not take too long. And what are you doing?""I'll rescue my parents anyway."The tray fell on the floor and it was necessary that the fairy use her magic to clean up that mess."Do you really want to invade Maleficent's lands? Oh, no! Do not do it!""Nobody want to do anything. These cowards will let my parents perish because they don't want to fight. Then I'll!""They do not want to fight because know they will die! Maleficent does not have mercy on anyone!""Then why didn't she kill everyone?" Aurora asked averting her eyes from the map and looking the fairy fixedly. "And why didn't she come after me?"Fauna looked away and said."She just wanted to humiliate us. Her greatest pleasure is to see everyone trampled underfoot.""Kill Felipe and me could have left everyone devastated and humiliated. But she only defeated and humiliated him.""She kidnapped your parents.""Maleficent may have something in mind and I need to find out.""Why do not you eat some?" She made an apple fly toward Aurora in an attempt to distract her thoughts. The idea had the opposite effect.The apple had a faint green glow because of the fairy's magic and brought back memories."This green light... I saw the same on the day that I fell in deep sleep! Were you?"

"What? No, it was Maleficent's magic!" The fairy said hiding the wand behind her back."The glow of your magic look like what I saw that day!""But the Maleficent's glow is also green and..." lie has never been her strong and the fairy stuttered too much, making Aurora even more suspicious."Fauna, please! Tell me the truth!""I can not say! I can not!" the fairy cried flying from one side to another. "I took an oath, please do not make me talk!""An oath?""We swore never let you know what happened that day. Sorry, dear, but that decision is not mine alone!""But I need to know!""I am sorry!" She said crying. "I am so sorry!" the Fairy flew away quickly before Aurora did many questions.The young woman remained where she was. That mystery was becoming increasingly confused.Another day of exhaustive researches without any results. Despite so much efforts, Maleficent couldn't understand what strange power was the one who protected her heart. She always was proud to having one of the most complete libraries of the world and yet couldn't find the information which needed most.Again and again she recalled the events of that day to see if had any clue. Nothing. She didn't remember to have evoked any spell when the sword had been thrown at her direction. She only planned to hold it with one paw and nothing else."At least my plan worked satisfactorily ." She muttered trying to comfort herself. The prince was totally humiliated and was kicked of from the country. His father also had to leave, both with tail between legs. Everyone had seen how powerful she was and the king and queen were learning to give her proper respect. They vowed to never interfere in her actions again and she was planning on releasing them in a few days, since she had no interest in killing or keep them there. Her goal was achieved.She left the library and decided to walk through the garden of the castle. Unlike the finely worked gardens of the king's palace, her gardens had a rustic look full of rocks, wild plants and flowers that grew as the nature ordered. The gardeners were servicing only for the plants continued healthy and didn't grow inordinately. Other than that, they could freely take on the shapes and colors they wanted."I think everything ended well. So why I am not happy?" She felt incomplete, as she had been felt for many years. It was missing a part of her. Her half. But griefing was futile. Her other half was lost forever and there was no way to retrieve her. The balance was damaged and it would take a long time before things come back to normal. The solution was to try to live with it for now.Even so it was hard. That dissatisfaction never stopped. Maleficent sat on a rustic stone bench and began to observe the flowers. Some were quite red, like the lips of that useless little princess. She remembered when they exchanged glances for a few seconds. "She has beautiful eyes... wait! What am I saying? What ridiculous!" She went away with a frown and stomped while trying to forget those ridiculous thoughts. But she wasn't successful at all.Aurora entered the fairies' bedroom and saw Merryweather resting on the bed. The fairy come back to normal thanks to the relentless work of the other two. There was only to rest to recover her energy."Are you feeling better?""Yes, dear. Thank you for asking. Answer me, is it true you are planning to rescue your parents? What ministers say about it?"She shrugged."Some laughed, others chided. They think I'm crazy or silly. No one believes I'm capable. Maybe even you!"Flora put a hand on her shoulder and said maternally."We take care you all your life and you are the daughter we never had. We do not want you to get hurt!""But I need to do something! I've never done anything in my life, never took any action by myself and always waited for someone to do something for me. Now its time for me to do something for others."They take a deep breath, talked a little to each other and Flora said."We can not go with you. Merryweather is still weak and we are not able to do much without her.""I understand and i'm willing to go alone."Merryweather didn't conform."We will not allow our girl without help because of small annoyances! Fauna, give me my jewelry box, please."The box was quickly placed in her hands and after searching a bit, Merryweather found three small blue stones, the only she had. That stones used to be very rare and difficult to make."These stones can take you anywhere you want, but each one can only be used once and by only one person. Two are for your parents, the third is for you. So you will come back safely.""I don't know how to thank you!"(Flora) "Do not thank us yet, darling. You still have to go through a thick forest to reach the Forbidden Lands. Take this." the fairy gave her a piece of stick. "With it, you can cross the forrest without problems because the plants will give you passage. Otherwise, you are going to be trapped there forever!"Finally, fauna came near the young woman and put a finger over her lips."When I gave you the gift of song, it was not just a beautiful voice. You are also able to tame the most ferocious beasts by just singing. There are many dragons in the Forbidden Land. If any of them attack you, do not hesitate. Sing!""Thank you for everything! I know you just want protect me... but still have so much I don't understand and I'd like to understand before I leave..."They gave a long sigh. The situation had reached a dead end and they knew it. Fairies talked again and finally took a major decision. Everything went wrong because they tried to stop the destiny. Maybe it was time to let things happen naturally. Flora made something appeared in the air and Aurora's eyes widened."The half Moon!" actually it wasn't exactly a half moon. One side was rounded, like a warped drop and was tied to a beautiful stream of white metal, possibly silver."This is what Maleficent gave you at the day of your baptism."Aurora took the jewel, which was totally white with only a black stone studded on the rounded end. It was beautiful and in no way looked like a bad thing."What does it mean?"Flora decided to speak the truth. At least the part they could talk."The truth is that when gave you this pendant, Maleficent also gave a part of herself."Aurora had to sit down to not falling. Her legs had turned to jelly and her heart beat racing."There is a part of Maleficent inside me?""Yes, dear. For this reason everyone was terrified. So Merryweather, which had not given her gift yet, tried to do something to undo what Maleficent had done.""To do this, I needed you to fall into a deep sleep." Merryweather explained in turn. "But I wanted it to be done safely, then I determined that you should hurt your finger on the spindle of the spinning wheel."(Fauna) "You needed to fall into a deep sleep only to be awakened by a prince. Maleficent's magic do not tolerate weakness, so we believed turn you fragile and delicate could make it disappear inside you!""Why did you take me to the forest?"(Flora) "Besides hiding you from Maleficent, who wanted to stop our work, we did it for you to grow pure, naive and dreamy. Today we see that was a mistake!"Aurora paused to process so many new information. Everything made sense and she understood why they had hidden the truth about her life. She had to keep innocent, pure, delicate and helpless."But it seems we were not successful in undo Maleficent's magic." Flora spoke again. "I think there is still a part of her inside you.""Why Maleficent did it?""She explained, but we were not able to understand and thought you was going to become evil like her.""You were very desired and expected not only by your parents, but for all kingdom as well. Then everyone were afraid that you became someone as evil as Maleficent. I know we was wrong, but we just wanted to protect you." Fauna explained too.She looked fairies with her eyes in tears. After all, they only want the best for her. It was never their intention to harm her."I don't know why Maleficent did it, but I intend to find out. It'll be fine, trust me.""We trust dear. We Trust." All three spoke at once.Aurora goodbye to each with a hug and ran into her bedroom to prepare for the journey that was going to be the first great adventure of her life.

Aurora wore pants made with resistant fabric, leather boots,  raw cotton shirt and a hunter leather jacket. She also wore a hooded cloack made of sheep's wool.  Her hair was well braided, piled high on the head and covered by a hat hunter. She had to be very well equipped to walk in the forest."How am I, Oscar?"The dragon shook his head in approval. And since she could have many days of walk, she also prepared a travel bag with food and water. Bread, cheese, dried fruits and dried meat. Things that needn't to cook. The stones were in a little bag near her chest and the stick was tied to a leather belt along with a dagger. In the neck, the pendant that Maleficent had given her.Her plan was go riding to the frontier forest and from there continue on foot because the horse wasn't able to ride inside the dense forest. After crossing the forest, she wanted to find Maleficent's castle and rescue her parents.Someone knocked the door and Oscar hid himself. Surely weren't  the fairies because they always entered without knocking."Come in!"Prime Minister, along with the head of the royal guard, entered and they had a very serious face."Any problems?" "Yes, your highness. I talked to the general and the other ministers and decided that Your Highness can not do that insanity." Prime Minister said."I'm going to save my parents!""Even our bravest warriors are not able of such a feat, let alone a fragile and delicate princess!" the head of the royal guard replied. "Don't worry, I can take care of myself."(Prime Minister) "It would be highly irresponsible on our part to leave the only descendant of the royal family to practice this insanity. So we decided Your Highness must be confined to your quarters until we make a decision.""You can't do this to me! I'm a princess and have the right to go where I want!"They weren't intimidated.(Head of the royal guard) "These are times of crisis, Your Highness. We must ensure for your well being. So we take an important decision."(Prime Minister) "In the absence of the king and queen, I will rule until a good suitor marries you and, thus, take the throne and rule our kingdom.""I should take the throne!"They almost laughed. "A woman? Please, we have laws and traditions! A woman can never ascend the throne! No way, Highness. You will be here until we decide your future." Prime Minister said arrogantly. "I decide my future!" Aurora yelled with her face red in anger. The head of the royal guard said nodding head negatively."See how uncontrolled you are? Women are not intended to govern. A simple crisis could generate a war!""I'm sorry, Your Highness. You must remain in your quarters for your safety and the safety of the kingdom."Both have the final word and left the bedroom ignoring the indignant protests from Aurora. The door was locked and two guards were outside."I don't believe, Oscar! They can't do this to me! I'm the princess, they must respect me! What a hate! I gotta get out of here!"She walked back and forth trying to think of an escape plan. The door was unfeasible. And the window?"It's high, but I think we can climb using some sheets. These idiots think can keep me here, but they're very much mistaken! I'm gonna escape right under their noses!"After midnight, when everyone were asleep, Aurora finally tied all the sheets and curtains to weave a very long and strong rope as she had learned with a frequenter of the tavern, which was sailor in his youth."We made these knots in ropes and so it became more resistant. At sea, this is very important!"The man was right. The sheets were really more resistant. When finished, she tied one end of makeshift rope to the foot of the heavy bed and threw the rest through the window. Now she had to be careful not to fall."It's time. Come on!" She she climbed down the rope feeling scared to death. Her foot slipped a few times and there were moments she was hanging with only one hand. The poor Oscar tried to help her, but he was too weak to carry a person.Aurora looked down and saw that a fall would be fatal. Was that adventure was good idea? The memory of those who underestimated her came to her mind. Were they right? Was she so weak? No, no way! Aurora took a breath and found a way to hold on better. That was the first step of her adventure. If she wasn't able to overcome this first hurdle, then could never do the rest.After much effort, she managed to get to one roof and from there she went to another until a place from where she was able to reach the ground with ease. When looking at the window of her room, she was impressed with herself for having gotten down alone.To get to the stables, she had to circumvent some guards who was doing the night patrol. Men's clothes were more practical. It was impossible to go unnoticed using a long and colorful dress. At the stables, she went to the back and took one of the horses that were used by the servants. Royal horses used to be noisy and wasn't good for doing long walks quickly.She rode the animal and took the path already knew. It was dark and she had only a torch lit by Oscar to light the way. According to map she was going to reach the forest within two, maybe two and a half hours. The road was long, but she couldn't stop. Once discovered her flee, the prime minister was going to send an army behind her. It was necessary to reach the forest before it.Fortunately, the horse was very strong and endured the long walk without need to stop to rest. It was still dark when she reached the dense forest and entered along with Oscar. The horse knew how to back to the stables alone.Even with the help of the stick given by Flora, the walk was very difficult. It was still dark, she was exhausted and didn't want to light a torch for fear of starting a fire. The forest was very dense."It's too dark, Oscar! Oh, no, what was I thinking? I'm scared!" She sat down with her back against a trunk and began to cry. The dragon curled around her neck trying to give courage. It was normal for the young woman to be scared, confused and distressed. "I think I should go back! I'm not able to save even myself, let alone my parents! This idea was horrible, horrible!"The dragon shook his head, saying that she couldn't give up."But I can't! Look at me! I have no strength to continue! The worst of all is when I get back, everyone will laugh at me! They said I'm weak and now they will be more sure I'm useless!"She kept weeping and crying until falling asleep. Oscar remained awake guarding. She really needed to rest before continuing the walk.Maleficent woke early after a sleepless night. Something seemed to be rolling inside her and didn't let her sleep well. What was happening anyway? It was a strange feeling, as if it was the harbinger of a big change. Ah, yes! She knew very well when things were about to change."What is coming toward me?" she asked looking at the sunrise through the bedroom window. A light wind blew in her face. It was the wind of change. Something that made her heart beat strangely.

The Queen was looking at the cracks in the wall trying not to go crazy. How long they was going to be forced to live in that cubicle? Their royal robes were replaced by simple raw cotton clothes made to prisoners. They ate three times a day and the food was acceptable, although very different from what they were used to. Every three days they bathed and the cell was clean. Considering  Maleficent's temper and fame, they expected a hundred times worse treatment. However, they were treated better than prisoners of their own dungeons."How is our daughter doing?" The queen asked so tired of thinking."She may be crying, poor dear! That coward Philip was unable to defeat Maleficent and now we will pay for this!""She said she will let us free.""Do not be deceived, surely she said so to play with us. We will languish here."She cry again and he tried to comfort her. Being pessimistic wasn't going to help anything, but he couldn't help himself."We have promised won't stop the changes. What else does she want?" - Leah sobbed."She wants our total submission. How humiliating!""We have no choice. Our kingdom can not be abandoned!"He pressed his lips together tightly. His wife was right, without a king the whole kingdom was going to turn upside down and their daughter was helpless. Maybe it was better to give in a little and continue their life than be proud and die in that tiny cell. They had no choice.Aurora woke up stretching and feeling body aches. That was the most uncomfortable place where she had slept! Oscar looked at her as if asking if everything was okay."Yes, I'm better and want to continue. I won't give those idiots the pleasure to see me defeated. C'mon!" She grabbed the stick and resumed the walk, which wasn't easy at all. Food was scarce and she needed to save it. At least Oscar had a variety of leaves and sap to feed, although it had no insect that strange forest.In fact, it hadn't even an animal. Everything was quiet and she heard only the wind rustling the leaves. The tree canopy was so dense that the sunlight barely entered, giving the feeling that it was late afternoon. What a strange forest!"Did she run away? How? When?" Prime Minister shouted walking from one side to another. The others were very worried. Without the princess, the entire royal family was over. "What about the fairies?""They are still confined to their quarters, excellence." The guard said. "They did not come out.""But the princess went out and disappeared! We have to send the guards after her!" The general said."If she went to the frontier forest, then it is useless." The economy minister said regretfully. "You know that no one can escape that infernal forest.""If so, then we send the fairies after her! They made that forest!" Another minister suggested.The Prime Minister gave a wicked smile and said."The princess may be dead. This is a great tragedy for our kingdom, but we have no choice. I do not want to waste valuable lives because of that reckless girl who did not follow our orders."The prime minister's intentions were more than clear. Without the royal family and no close relative to take the throne, he was up to perform this function. Be king wouldn't a bad idea and he was liking it! They walked for several days, although Aurora couldn't say how many. She had lost track of time. Her hand was holding the stick firmly, knowing without it she'd be lost forever. Oscar went in front as if he knew which direction to go. It made sense. If Maleficent's lands were populated by dragons, it was normal that he could find it without problems. Maybe their parents were born there."This wind... I hadn't felt it before!" She said breathing deeply and feeling a cool and gentle breeze, unlike the hot and stuffy air of the forest. Oscar flew faster and they soon reached an opening between the trees which let in the sunlight. Finally the sun!"I can't believe we did it! We crossed the forest!" She screamed and jumped for joy when something caught her attention. No, it wasn't possible! The landscape was very similar to her kingdom. Did she have returned to the starting point?Aurora looked at the sides confused and dazed, but Oscar was calm and wanted to move on."Are you sure that these are the forbidden lands? There's nothing horrendous here! This place is so beautiful!"In fact, it was a beautifully green meadow with some flowers and a creek running nearby. The place also had beautiful mountains with snow capped peaks. Around these mountains, large winged creatures flew and Aurora saw that were dragons. Dragons? So yes, she was on the right track!But that place was very different from which described by the fairies. Of course, they were lying the whole time, so it should be no surprise.They kept walking until they reached the creek, where she washed her face, drank water and tried to rest a bit before move on. Her stomach growled loudly since she didn't eat enough for several days."What a hunger! I could eat a whole pig!"Oscar went into a tree and came back with a few leaves in his mouth. Aurora laughed."Thanks, friend, but I don't eat tree leaves. Don't worry, I just need some rest."She tried close her eyes to doze off a bit when a growl made her stand up with one jump."What's it? Oh no!" She said terrified to see nothing less than a big dragon headed in their direction. Why did she have to be so unlucky?"At this point, she should have already gone through the forest." Fauna said looking out the window."So she reached the forbidden lands." Flora was worried.Merryweather slept peacefully because still needed to rest. Fauna answered."For years, we never believe her and nothing worked. So let's believe our little girl this time. She is stronger than we think."Flora was silent and then said."She still has a part of Maleficent inside her. What will happen if they meet?""If Maleficent realize this, so I believe she will not do anything to her. Otherwise, There is no way to know. We can only pray."The other fairy only gave a sad sigh hoping that everything went well for that young woman.

Aurora and Oscar were fleeing from the huge dragon that was flying on their heels. It was a green and gray dragon that snarled and spat fire trying to catch them thinking they're a delicious snack."Damn, leave us alone! Please!" She cried. Her legs ached, her heart was about to jump out of her chest and she could no longer run. "Why this beast won't go away... beast? Wait!" A crazy idea came to her and she stopped running. The dragon stood before them, ready to shoot a fireball and take a well roasted snack.Wasting no time, Aurora started singing as if her life depended on it, because it really depended. The dragon closed the mouth slowly, lowered the wings and bent the head to one side, so to another, as if he wanted hear well.The beast was lowering the head slowly until at the height of princess, who took courage to approach and caress his muzzle. He was a huge and magnificent animal! Not to mention that she was doing the dream to see a real dragon!When the song ended, Aurora stopped stopped a little hoping the dragon remained tame. The beast didn't move and kept docile. She decided to take a chance."Please, I beg you! Take me to the Maleficent's castle! My parents are there and I need to save them! If you do, I'll sing for you all the way."The great animal didn't move or react as if expecting for something. Oscar flew to the top of his head and called Aurora with a small growl. She understood it was safe and rode too. Once she was settled, the dragon took flight reaching great height for her fascination. She was riding a dragon! A fierce and dangerous dragon!Oh, how she wanted the idiot Prime Minister and the head of the royal guard to see her at that moment! The wind blew in her face and she looked the landscape below them, it was breathtaking! But when remembered the promise, she started singing again to the delight of the beast that moved on fast. Traveling this way was much better and fun!Maleficent's castle was at the top of a mountain, but it wasn't nearly like the picture of the book. It was a great castle with sober look, but clean and well kept. There was no ruined castle surrounded by darkness.The dragon landed at the foot of the mountain in a discreet place. After thanking him, Aurora headed to the castle. The only way was a road that went up the mountain. Nothing difficult or complicated except for the fact that there are guards watching the entrance gate."We have to sneak. If Maleficent find us, it's over!"She walked a bit around the mountain and saw it was impossible to climb without the risk of falling and breaking her neck. It was too steep. To enter through the front gate, she needed to dodge the guards.At the foot of the mountain had a village that left her impressed. There were other people living in the forbidden lands? She always thought Maleficent lived alone with her bizarre guards. The village was very different from those in her kingdom. The houses were well built, the streets were large, very clean and paved with stone.  Everything seemed normal except for the fact along with humans, also walked creatures like elves, goblins and trolls. And even some humans used different clothes. Some women was weating pants like men, other used dresses that reached just below the knees. That would be a scandal anywhere else.Didn't people care about other kind of creatures among them? Everyone seemed to coexist smoothly. If any of these creatures appeared in her kingdom, would cause pandemonium among people.Oscar was over her shoulder and no one cared. Maybe because they were already used to dragons. Walk around the village was good, but Aurora had more urgent issues to solve: how invade the castle and rescue her parents without Maleficent realize? The answer came when she walked near a market. A man was loading a wagon with fruits and other foodstuffs while chatting to another."I still have to make this delivery to the castle and then go to blacksmith..."She stopped. Was that wagon going to the castle? How convenient! But how to hide among the fruits? She could be discovered quickly. When saw she was confused, Oscar flew to the underside of the wagon trying to give an idea.She gave a smile. If she could handle at the bottom of the wagon, no one was going to see her. Before anyone saw her,  she took advantage of wagoner was distracted and quickly went under the wagon, holding on it tightly.Of course it was easier to talk than to do. She had no other place to stand and her arms and legs had to hold the whole weight of her body. For Oscar was easier because he was able to hold anywhere without problems. The journey took forever and she was about to give up when the wagon stopped. They had come to the palace gate and she made a titanic effort to stand firm.The gate was open and the wagon entered, turned around the courtyard and stopped at the kitchen door. It was with great relief she broke free and when could, come out of there quickly to hide behind some barrels of wine."Now we have to find my parents." She spoke very low for Oscar. "They should be in the dungeon, but I don't know where it is. Can you find them?"Oscar nodded."Great. Now I need a disguise!" She couldn't walk around like that or people would suspect. And not knowing the place, Aurora was at a distinct disadvantage. Some maids walked nearby, chatting between them, and they were wearing the same clothes. A brown dress with sleeves up to the elbows, white collar, an apron and they wore a white scarf on their heads. She had an idea.Something was bothering her so much to the point that she couldn't take care of her duties. It took away her concentration and Maleficent realized she wasn't going to rest until have resolved that issue."Something is going on in this castle." She knew the place like the back of her hand because she has built everything since foundations. So if there was something different there, she was able to notice. With a little concentration, she saw there was a strange person, someone who entered her domain without authorization. "I have a visitor. Well... It would be impolite of me not to give a warm welcome!"She was a woman about twenty-three years with very black hair, as well as her eyes. She was bound and gagged inside a tool shed. A sheet stolen from a clothesline covered her body so that she wouldn't get naked and exposed."I am sorry, please! Sorry!" Aurora was speaking while wearing her clothes. "My parents are in danger and I need to save them. Promise I won't hurt you. I only need your clothes!"The woman just looked at her with wide eyes and dropping some squeaks because of the gag. Oscar hid under the skirts and Aurora went away carefully guarding the three stones in a pocket. It was enough to give it to her parents and everyone could get out safely.Dressed like a maid, she had more freedom to walk without being hassled. Now she needed an excuse to go to the dungeon and she knew what to do. She sneaked into the kitchen, grabbed a tray, put some food and went to the dungeon, which was under the castle.The dungeon was lit by torches since it was on the underground. The guard who watched over the entrance let her enter without asking questions, thinking she was going to take food to the prisoners."Strange ... here's empty!" She thought to see that most of the cells was empty. That place was very clean and tidy for a dungeon. Oscar gave a slight bite on her leg and she saw that had found her parents when they came close to one of the cells where there was a guard watching. He looked like a gargoyle with a pig's snout and had unfriendly face."Halt! Who goes there?" Said a rough voice between grunts."I bring food to the prisoners!""It's not mealtime and Her Excellency isn't here. Only she has the key to the cell!"Aurora cursed internally. How could she open the cell without the key? Well, she hadn't come too far to give up. The guard looked at her even more suspicious and asked."Who are you? I've never seen you around before. You're not the maid who brings food to them.""I was hired yesterday""Where is your permission to enter the dungeon?""The other guard didn't asked and...""That's because he's an idiot, but I'm not. Show the permission now or I'll arrest you!""Calm down! I'll show you. It's right here!" She shouted slamming the tray on the guard's head. It didn't have much effect, since he was wearing a helmet."Your cheeky, you're in trouble!" He tried to hit her with an ax.Being lighter and agile, Aurora deviated from the guard, took a wood seat and slammed full force into his nape remembering the lessons from an experienced fighter who taught her to hit the back of the opponent's nape to make him pass out. As the guard was big and strong, she had to hit several times while being careful not to be hit by the ax. The guy staggered and she kept hitting until he fell unconscious on the ground. She was panting, her hair became disheveled and her face was red."Aurora? Is it really you?" Her father asked looking out the small window of the cell door."Mom, Dad! I came to set you free!""Heavens, I will faint!" her mother said distressed and emotional. How her fragile and delicate daughter had managed to get there?"Not now, please!"The small window of the door was protected by a kind of grid and it wasn't possible to pass the stones there. As had no key, she grabbed her stabb and inserted the tip into the lock making various movements and forcing ever deeper. After much effort, she heard a click and the door opened."Where did you learn that?" her parents asked scandalized to see their daughter breaking a door. She hugged them happy and said."I'll explain later. Now let's get out of here fast!"Before she could take stones from the pocket, a voice spoke filling them with dread."What have we here? A family gathering in my dungeon? How touching!"

The queen fainted on the spot. Pale and trembling, the king tried to hold his wife without fainting too. Aurora turned and swallowed noisily to see none other than Maleficent before her, accompanied by some guards and with an evil smile of victory on her face. Right, things had gone very wrong!The wicked fairy come closer and said slowly raising an eyebrow."Well, few things can surprise me and you are one of them. How did you get up here, Princess?"She was silent. The words didn't come out of her throat."It does not matter. As you see this place has many cells and I will provide one especially for you."The young woman overcame the state of shock and asked."Please let us go! They have suffered enough!" She asked trying to touch the fairy. It was in vain. Maleficent looked at her like was having fun at her expense."What a beautiful, but  I am not moved by that. Your parents have not finished their time here yet and because of your meddling, I think they will be here for longer."Aurora was terrified. See her parents being punished even more for her fault? No way! She decided to negotiate."I invaded your castle, not them! You can punish me, but let them go!"Maleficent tilted her head slightly to the side and asked."Let me see if I understand: do you want to serve the sentence in their place?""No, Aurora! Do not do it!" Her father pleaded quietly. But she ignored.Aurora swallowed again and said with a trembling voice."Yes. Let them go away. I'll stay in their place."After a few seconds of silence, looking blankly to the princess, Maleficent gave a cynical laugh."Silly girl! Let me teach you one thing: never offer what can be forcibly taken. It is useless. You are my prisoner now and there is nothing to negotiate!"Something seemed to roll inside her. That woman wasn't taking her seriously and certainly should be thinking she was a foolish and weak princess. That made Aurora clench the fists angrily and in a sudden burst of courage, she came close to Maleficent and took the stones from pocket."I can leave at anytime! You can't keep me here!""Ah, I see you have an escape plan!"That situation was getting pretty interesting after all. Maleficent knew those stones and it was enough one thought of Aurora for her fade away."Then why do not you disappear now?" She asked provocatively. Aurora came even closer looking her straight in the eyes.Of course Maleficent didn't back off one inch, then they were face to face. The king shook terrified to see his daughter before the terrible and dangerous Maleficent. Aurora also felt a twinge of fear. That woman was very tall, more than Philip. With the horns and that always erect and haughty stance, she looked huge next to the young woman with frail and delicate body. But she was determined not to back down."I used sheets to climb the tower of my bedroom and escape the palace, rode three whole hours to get to the frontier forest, then took days to cross a dense and thick forest and I'm starving!"Maleficent was still staring at her without saying anything. Those eyes... there was something in those eyes. She could see! Aurora continued."I was chased by a huge dragon and had to sing for him not devour me and bring me here! Then I entered this castle holding myself at the bottom a wagon, tied a maid inside the tool shed to take her clothes off and had to fight with this fat, ugly and rude guard! Not to mention the effort I had to pick the lock of this cell!"Aurora took a breath and said with energetic voice to the woman who stood before her in silence and watching everything with wide eyes."I nearly died to get here, so they'll leave anyway!"After that, her father fainted following the queen who was also lying on the ground. His nerves couldn't stand.Maleficent looked the princess up and down feeling a strange warmth in the chest. Never, not in a million years, she could believe this young woman who seemed so weak and foolish would be able to go through so many things. Not the strongest and bravest warriors had the courage to invade her castle, but that skinny human did it.And looking at her eyes, she saw. There was still hope. Those fairies didn't finish it all. Thinking thus, a decision had to be taken. She couldn't let her go no way because everything could be lost again if she left Aurora return to the palace with her parents. The place of the princess was there with her. Forever."If you stay here in their place, will be my prisoner. Do you understand it?""Yes, I understand.""You will never leave the castle unless I allow it. Never try to run away because I can find you even in hell!""I promise I won't try to escape.""Are you sure?"Aurora looked into her eyes and Maleficent held the gaze with the same intensity. They stared at each other for a while and the princess replied."Yes, I'm sure. Release my parents and I'll be in their place. I promise never try to escape from the castle.""Done." She reached out and ordered. "The stones."Very hesitantly, she reached out with stones towards Maleficent, who took just one and ordered."Put one in each hand, think at the palace and tight. It will be enough."After giving them a kiss on their cheek, Aurora put a stone in her mother's hand and imagined her lying on the bed of her parents' quarters. The woman disappeared in an instant. The same happened with her father."They are gone.""I see. Well, what will I do with you, little princess?" she asked with that wicked smile just to scare her.Aurora fidgeted uneasily and something went under her skirts catching Maleficent by surprise."Oscar? Oh no! I should have sent you along with them."The older woman's eyes narrowed a bit and she asked."Where did you get this dragon? And why gave him this ridiculous name?""His name isn't ridiculous! And I hatched his egg!""You?" She asked totally incredulous. It was hard to believe that someone like that little princess was able to hatch a dragon egg."His parents were killed by Philip and let this egg. So I hatched it and Oscar was born.""Let me see. Do not be afraid, I would never hurt a dragon."Oscar left Aurora's shoulder and landed over Maleficent's arm, who examined him carefully."It is a pygmy dragon, a very rare specimen. Let me see... it's a male, has two and a half months old, is well fed and looks healthy." She took one wing gently with two fingers. "But the wings are a bit stunted. He hasn't flown a lot and the scales are dry. A good oil bath solves it."Aurora was amazed to see Maleficent showing a little of her knowledge about dragons. "Well, I think we had enough talk." She put the dragon over her shoulder and motioned for Aurora to follow her.They came out of the dungeon and went into the castle. It was a surprise for her to see that the castle had nothing terrifying. They walked in silence until they came to a corridor where Maleficent opened a door."You'll stay here."Aurora saw with surprise it was a beautiful and nicely decorated quarters. She looked Maleficent feeling confused."Consider it a reward for what you did for this dragon. But do not forget you are a prisoner and will be confined here until further orders.""What about Oscar? What will you do with him?""He needs some care that you are unable to provide now. Do not worry, he will be well taken care of. As for you, take a bath immediately. A maid will to bring you clean clothes. You are filthy and I do not want my castle to be infected."Aurora took one last look at her friend and entered the room feeling sad and depressed. Now she was a prisoner of that woman and didn't have Oscar to keep company.The door was closed and she saw that the lock disappeared. So there was no escape. She could only cry, putting out all the accumulated tension for days.After left Aurora, Maleficent went to her private chamber to provide care for the dragon."You came in handy. I really needed a good excuse to let her in that quarters instead the dungeon." She said softly stroking the dragon's head with one finger. Oscar just smiled in his own way. Over time, things were going be fine between them.

Aurora tried to count the days and lost count after the fifth or sixth. Since that day, she didn't saw Maleficent again, nor Oscar. It was maddening to be alone with no one to talk to. She tried not complaining since the quarters was better than a dungeon, but that loneliness was hard to bear.Her quarters was very comfortable. Actually, there were three rooms. The bedroom had a beautiful canopy bed made of heavy wood carved with several mythological figures, covered with red linen sheets and silk-covered pillows with rich embroidery. The mattress was thickly stuffed with down and feathers and velvet curtains around the bed gave more privacy. A bed like that used to be extremely expensive and could even be passed on as an inheritance.In front of the bed, there was a dark wood chest and on each side one nightstand also made of dark wood. There was also a dressing table with a mirror and several drawers. The mirror was a very expensive item and depending on the size, could cost the price of a warship.The bedroom also had a chair next to a window, the floor was lined with beautiful oriental carpets and hanging from the ceiling, a chandelier candle. It was separated from another room by a curtain made with beautiful embroidery.The second room, where was the entrance door, had a black fabric sofa, table with two chairs, chandelier candle and carpets covering the floor. And also had a balcony, where she spent a lot of time admiring the landscape. It was her only contact with the outside world.The third was a bathroom, something quite revolutionary. It was a very clean and spacious bathroom, covered with tiles that formed beautiful pictures of birds and flowers and also had bathtub and various paraphernalia for hygiene. There was even a toilet seat thanks to a system of water and sewage that Aurora had no idea how it worked, because never seen anything like it.She had to take a bath every day, which wasn't usual at that time. Full body baths were made usually once or twice a year. The skin was cleaned by rubbing it with a damp cloth. But even among the nobles, the ritual was repeated only every two days.After the bath, she used aromatic oils from the East. Her skin became more beautiful and the hair silkier. Maleficent had also provided some dresses that were taken by a maid who took care of her everyday needs. Ironically, she was the same maid who Aurora had tied and gagged to steal her clothes. Her name was Emma and she had a different face, looking like a foreigner. When they met for the second time, it was an embarrassing situation and Aurora apologized again."I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you!""At least you saved your parents.""It took long to find you?""No more than one half hour, I think.""I hope Maleficent hasn't punished you for what happened."The maid grimaced and said."Why do you think I'm here?" To see the Aurora's embarrassed face, she laughed. "I'm joking, silly. No, she didn't apply any punishment to me. Her excellence isn't as bad as people say and gradually you'll see."The visits of the maid were the only thing that alleviated her boredom, but Emma couldn't stay with her for long. She appeared to bring food, help her with the bath and do the clean. During the rest of the time, Aurora was alone with her thoughts.As she wasn't used to spending long periods without do anything, that boredom seemed kill her little by little. Several times she thought that if things continue like this, jump off the balcony could be a good option.In the royal palace, the mood was of sadness and desolation.Aurora's parents suffered for leaving her daughter with Maleficent. That evil creature had won after all. Now she had Aurora in her power to make all kinds of atrocities.The fairies were also apprehensive. Aurora had a chance to be fine, but also had the same chance of being in the dungeon eating only bread and water. Maleficent was unpredictable and they didn't know what to expect.Prime Minister was also very upset because with return of the king and queen, his dreams of take the throne fell apart. But they were so sad and depressed that it was likely not to last long. Maybe he just needed to be patient and let things happen.After bathing Oscar once again with aromatic pine oil, Maleficent provided a tray with various tasty fruit and fat moth larvae. The little dragon delighted with his meal and had put on weight. His wings were stronger and the scales were beautiful and bright. But she noticed the poor creature missed Aurora."Impressive... how she was able to hatch your egg and take care of you without my noticing?" She said stroking his head with one finger. Well, that princess seemed so dull and boring that she had lost all interest in watching her, which was a big mistake. How many interesting things she has done and go unnoticed?Not to mention the big risk of someone inexperienced to take care of so rare specie of dragon. She must really have something special, otherwise that dragon wouldn't have survived. But she had to call him Oscar? What a silly name! And it wasn't possible to change. That kind of dragon used to be very loyal and she knew it. Although he liked to walk perched over her shoulder, he also missed Aurora."I think we should make a visit to Princess. What do you think little one?" She asked affectionately and the dragon made a sound showing joy. "You miss her, I know." Although she didn't want to admit, she also missed Aurora.Aurora was lying on the couch staring at the ceiling when the door opened. Believing is Emma, she didn't move and so was startled when saw Maleficent standing in the middle of the room staring at her intently."Is that how you receive the owner of this castle?"The young woman raised in a single jump."Sorry! I thought you were Emma, sorry!""Do you mistook me for a maid?" Maleficent asked pretending to be angry, but laughing inside."Of course you're not a maid, no way! (gasp) I mean, I didn't know it was you and...""Enough! I only came because someone wants to see you." The dragon came from behind her and flew to curl around Aurora's neck, leaving her very happy."Oscar! How I miss you, my baby! I want a kiss!"Aurora pursed her lips and Oscar licked with his forked tongue. Maleficent couldn't hold a grimace of disgust."Just for your information, he ate moth larvae a few minutes ago.""So what? He's my little baby, so cute and pretty!" the fairy rolled her eyes and decided to get out before vomiting."He can stay with you today. Tomorrow I will come to pick him up.""What? No way, he's my dragon!""Listen to me, little princess." Maleficent said scornfully. "Everything that exists in this castle and these lands belongs to me. Including 'your' dragon and..." she got her face close to the younger woman said softly and looking right into her eyes "You."Those yellow and green eyes mesmerized her and for a moment she felt the breath of the older woman. Maleficent walked away as if nothing had happened and said coldly."Enjoy your time together." She was leaving when Aurora took courage and said."Look... I...""You what?" The fairy turned to her again."I like this room and I'm not complaining about anything...""I do not mind about it anyway.""But I... I...""Stop wasting my time and just talk what you want!""I'm stuck here all the time and don't go out for anything!""Well... this is the idea. Prisoners are usually confined to their cells. It's is a room, I know, but the principle is the same." Maleficent said with sarcasm."Yes, I know I'm a prisoner, but look: there is no escape from this castle, so why can't I leave the room? I'll only within the castle and...""Oh, no! I gave you a finger and now you want my hand?""But there's nothing to do!"Maleficent made an impatient gesture and said."If you want reasons to complain, I can put you in the dungeon. Do you want it?"The young woman shook her head, with eyes filled with tears. Why does this woman have to be so cold and cruel?"Answer!"No...""Then do not bother me with insignificant things.""But..." she still tried to speak quietly"But what?"Finally she gave up. That fairy wouldn't be moved by her pain."Nothing...""Good."As the door slammed, Aurora sat down on the couch to cry again.Let Aurora walk freely through the castle shouldn't be a problem. If she took some security measures, like increasing vigilance and never leave the princess alone, Maleficent could let her out of her chambers. But she didn't want to take any chances. The princess was able to enter her castle without being seen and when Maleficent found her, she was almost escaping with her parents. If she had arrived a few minutes later, it would have been too late.Of course that couldn't last forever, but Maleficent decided it best to keep her confined until she decided what to do.After much weeping and mourning, Aurora went to the balcony to look at the landscape with Oscar by her side."Did you see how she treated me? She has no respect for me and I'm getting tired!" She had realized that Maleficent didn't tolerate weakness nor wasn't touched by tears. At the palace was different. She just had to make a sad face, drop few tears and everyone ran to meet her wishes, albeit within certain limits.Everything has changed. Tears and sad faces weren't going to take her anywhere. If she wanted something, so had to fight for it. And she was going to fight and show to Maleficent she was the one who write her own rules. "She'll learn to respect me anyway! I won't accept being treated like crap anymore!" She spoke with the confident look and clenching the fists in anger.But for that she needed a plan and after thinking and weighing the pros and cons, she knew what to do. Aurora had carefully planned everything aware that she was taking a big risk because Maleficent could be terribly angry. Well, she wasn't afraid. It was necessary to take risks from time to time and somehow she knew that the fairy wouldn't hurt her.The next day, Maleficent was heading to Aurora's chambers to pick up Oscar, as she wanted him to pose for some drawings. It was very difficult to find a pygmy dragon and she needed to document that specimen in every possible way.She hoped that Aurora wouldn't ask again to leave her quarters, as she didn't want to give in and wasn't happy to deny it. This point was confusing and she didn't know what to do.At the appointed time, Maleficent went to Aurora's quarters to pick up Oscar. Opening the door, she saw her stroking the dragon's head quietly. Her face was calm and didn't seem sad. She didn't realize the princess was watching her and saw when she kept the key in the long sleeve, since she only needed the key to open the door. When the door was closed, the lock disappeared. "I came to get him, as I said yesterday.""You can go with her Oscar." She said absently, as if no one important was nearby."Do you woke sassy today by any chance?""No. But I woke up with an idea." the woman raised an eyebrow."What idea?""How about a game?"The corner of her red mouth twitched into a light smile. That could be interesting."I am hearing, little princess.""It's simple. If I manage to leave this room, you'll allow me to walk freely through the castle." Maleficent couldn't help but laugh."Leave this room? How? By the window?""No. The sheets aren't enough and I want use the door.""Really? So hilarious! I do not know if you noticed, but there is no lock on the door to you break."Aurora looked right into her face, put her hands on hips and spoke boldly."If I could reach your castle and free my parents, so I can leave this room!"Maleficent held her gaze with the same boldness."You seem so sure of yourself! I think this game can be fun." She thought for a moment and asked. "What will I gain if you lose? Yes, because a bet must have a prize for the winner. If I win, then I shall gain something, no?""And what do you want?" she asked disguising nervousness."Simple. If you win, I will let you walk freely through the castle. If lose, will live in the dungeon. You have one week."An unpleasant cold ran down her spine. It was all or nothing. Gain more freedom or go for an even worse prison. It was scary, but she couldn't go back or Maleficent would never respect her. And she already had a plan."I'm going to win long before that, you can expect!" Aurora spoke with an extra dose of confidence and boldness hoping Maleficent took the bait.And it worked. The fairy came very close and Aurora swallowed noisily. The woman was so close she could smell her breath, that was was warm and pleasant. Why did she always stare her like that? It didn't matter. Everything was according to plan."The higher you go, the harder you fall! You are too confident, so I will love see your crying face when you lose the challenge and have to go live in the dungeon!" She pulled away and left the room laughing loudly.When the door was closed, Aurora gave the biggest smile in recent weeks to contemplate the key she had taken from the Maleficent's sleeve without her noticing.To see that Oscar looked at her reproachfully, Maleficent said."Do not give me that look. It was she who challenged me. She was very brave, I must admit. But of course she will never win the challenge. It is impossible to leave that room without my magic."The door could only be opened with her key, which was kept only with her or handed over to a maid who did the cleaning and took meals to Aurora. Knowing that the princess could subdue the maid, as she had done so before, Maleficent decided to send two or three guards along with her. In any case, the princess wasn't going to overcome this challenge even with a miracle. Her victory was guaranteed."You do not need to worry. The dungeon is clean and after a while, I will think of an excuse to get her out of there again."Her heart was beating quickly and a load of adrenaline ran through her body when she opened the room door. There was nobody nearby, lucky for her.Aurora put one foot out, then another and finally left. She had won the bet! And now? What to do? Perhaps look for Maleficent and show she had won the challenge? After all, this was her goal the whole time: show how much she was smart and could do whatever she wanted. After walking for a while, she found the throne room where Maleficent made the decisions. The door was ajar and she decided to take a look. The fairy was sitting on a throne with some men and women around and they seemed to be discussing a matter of great importance. Then talk to her at that moment could be a bad idea, so Aurora decided to do a tour and talk to her later. Maybe a stroll around castle courtyard?She took a deep breath to get out for the first time after several days confined. The sun shone brightly and there was great activity on the place. Servants came and went doing chores and Aurora decided to explore a little."What are you doing here?" Asked a panicked voice."Hi, Emma!""You are in so much trouble! Her Excellency forbade you to leave the room!"Aurora told about the bet, but it didn't reassure the maid at all."She hates to lose, believe me!""She'll have to get used to it!""You better get back to your room!""Doing so, I'll lose the bet and go to the dungeon. Don't worry, she won't hurt me. Didn't have any interesting place where I can go?"Emma gave a defeated sigh. "All right. You can go to the castle garden. But please, don't tell her I saw you!"Again she was amazed to see that was a very beautiful garden with rustic and wild appearance that fascinated her at first sight."Wow, it's much more beautiful than the gardens of the palace!"That garden had a pond with colorful fish and flowers floating over the water. Also had a huge tree in the center, and stone benches, arbors and a wide variety of plants she had never seen before. She walked down the stone road and her attention was drawn to two trees that had united the treetops, whose purple flowers fell in beautiful curls as if were jewels. Under treetops had a stone bench.The place was fresh, calm and she felt the delicate perfume of the flowers. From where she stood, she could see the pond and behind, the large central tree. It was hard to believe that someone like Maleficent had done something so beautiful!The meeting was adjourned and she dismissed the ministers and servants. Her next appointment was scheduled for after lunch. What to do until then? It didn't take much thinking to get an idea."Would you like visit the little princess?" Maleficent asked Oscar.The dragon raised his head, as if in warning and then flew off quickly."Wait, where are you going?" Maleficent got up and went after him. Oscar flew through the corridors until leave the castle with her at his heels. Then he changed course and she saw that he was going to the garden. What was up with that dragon?The answer came quickly when they arrived near two trees that had united the treetops and she saw someone sitting on the bench. The fairy stopped, totally speechless, surprised and unsure how to react."Hi, my baby! You found me!" Aurora said cheerfully when he came to curl around her neck. "Hello, Maleficent!"The fairy stared the princess with wide-eyed and barely controlling her breath. Aurora looked at her with a smile of victory and having fun with her totally incredulous expression."How did you..." she started talking as soon as she managed to move her lips again."How I came out? By the door, like everyone else!" She replied moving nimbly the key between the fingers.The fairy startled and groped the sleeve frantically searching for her key which was no longer there."What's up? Have you lost something important?" The young woman asked boldly and loving seeing the expression of unbelief on that pale face."Did you steal my key? How did you do it without me noticing?""Let's say my hands are faster than your magic!""Really?" She approached the young woman, grabbed her wrist with one hand and recovered the key with the other. "And it seems your tongue is faster than your common sense!"Aurora didn't flinch and kept staring at the fairy boldly. She didn't wanted to be intimidated again."Anyway, I won and now I have the right to walk through the castle as you promised!""Yes... as I promised." She also spoke still holding Aurora's wrist. The young woman's skin seemed to burn her hand, but in a nice way. That was the first body contact, skin to skin, between them and it was difficult let her go.Gradually she was calming. Apparently, that princess wasn't as foolish as seemed and she promised herself not to underestimate her again. Finally, she let go of her wrist."Why did you come to this garden?""It's beautiful here. I like how the plants grow free with no one to prune them the whole time.""I prefer things take its natural course. But of course my gardeners take care to prevent this garden to become a complete chaos. Some order is also necessary.""Chaos is also necessary." Aurora said admiring the rustic and wild beauty. "Otherwise, it would just be a boring and bland garden. I like that."She walked nonchalantly among the flowers, smelling one and other. Maleficent watched her movements attentively."This garden looks large. Don't you want to show me?" the princess invited and she went out of her trance suddenly."As promised, you can walk freely through the castle, except my private chambers or my laboratory.""Do you have a laboratory?""Yes and do not you dare spy on what is not your business!"The princess made a face."I bet it's the most interesting part of the castle...""Continued forbidden. Live with it." she took Oscar and went out with head held high. She could have lost the bet, but never dignity.When left the gardens, she gave a smile of satisfaction with the victory of the Princess despite being with lightly wounded ego for having been tricked so easily. And she really wanted to have stayed and shown her the garden. It would have been nice walk with Aurora, only them."What am I thinking?" She lightly shook her head and returned to the throne room. But the princess's beautiful face refused to get out of her mind. 

Philip was getting tired of the stares and whispers. Even his subjects lost respect for him! Everyone knew he was beaten and humiliated by Maleficent in front of his in-laws and bride and later kicked out of Stephan's kingdom like a mangy dog. What a humiliation! After that shame, there was no way of marrying the princess. The kingdom didn't need a weak and cowardly king.His father was depressed and getting sick day by day. The enemy king made constant threats of war, since without marriage, there was no alliance with Stefan's kingdom and the ministers were turning against him. What else could happen?His anger was totally turned against Maleficent, the cause of all his misfortunes. She destroyed in a few minutes all his plans of greatness, power and wealth. If only there was some way defeating her! No, there wasn't. The enchanted sword that fairies gave him wasn't able to overcome her that time. That creature was more powerful than ever and he wasn't able to defeat her. No without help."Is there no one in this world that can beat her?" He said aloud walking from one side to another. Maybe a witch, wizard, whatever! He was willing to pay very well! If anyone was able to defeat Maleficent, so could become a great ally and no one was going to stop him. He could not only conquer the Stefan' kingdom as also other neighboring kingdoms. It was only necessary to find the right person and he decided to start the search, even if had to rummaging the entire world.It was a beautiful day and Aurora decided read in the garden. Her favorite place there was the bank below the two united treetops, perfect for a relaxing reading.For winning the bet, Aurora could walk freely through the castle. Her favorite place was the library, where there was a huge amount of books and she could read at will. At least those who she could understand, since many were written in a foreign language. The best thing was not have anyone to tell her that those books were too complicated for a maiden.When she wasn't in the library, she visited the kitchen and even had befriended the cooker, a short and chubby woman with big elf ears. Occasionally she helped prepare meals to feel useful. But most of the time, she liked to read about subjects that interested her.The book of the day was about the story of King Arthur, which she always wanted to read."Do not overdo it with reading or your brain will escape through the ears." Said a voice and she was startled to see Maleficent sitting beside her. Where did she come from?"Why are you so annoying?""And why are you so scrawny? Who sees you thinks there is no enough food in this castle!""What one thing has to do with the other?""Nothing. But it is true." Maleficent answered shamelessly and Aurora became angrier. They stared at each other for a while, doing their best angry faces. Finally the blonder couldn't stand it and burst out laughing. "It is useless, I always win!""Of course! When it is to grimace, you win either way!""I will pretend I did not hear that, you foolish! I came for Oscar because need him for a work in my book."Without asking permission or please, she put Oscar on the shoulder and stood up."We will see at night, little princess.""When will you learn to say my name?"She just looked over her shoulder with that smirk and walked away without saying anything, letting Aurora very mad. But what made her angrier was being unable to stay mad at Maleficent for long and in the end she laughed. How someone so difficult, annoying and arrogant could be so fascinating and sometimes amusing?What a strange woman! Over time she realized that many things people said about her weren't true. Although the fairy was no example of kindness and sweetness, she wasn't the spawn of all evil. Maleficent was a difficult and controlling person who liked to order and be obeyed. She ruled the forbidden lands with an iron hand and punished those who defied or disobeyed her orders. Her face was always serious and she rarely smiled for someone but Aurora.Her appearance was also another surprise, since she wasn't ugly as the fairies had drawn. Her skin was very pale and at times appeared to have a slight greenish hue depending on the lighting, not being that thing like grass. The chin, although a bit pronounced, wasn't as long and pointed as illustrated in books and her face had no wrinkles, although Aurora was unable to determine her age. And she wasn't that stick with horns as showed in the book. Maleficent was pretty in an unconventional way. A diabolical but pleasant beauty. Maleficent didn't seem worried about clothes and always had the same look every day. Her only jewelry was a black stone ring always wore on right hand's finger. Her horns was wrapped in strips of black leather that also wrapped around her head and made her face look sharper, more threatening and at the same time symmetrical and harmonious. She also used makeup and painted nails, something Aurora had never seen before.Usually women had only short nails trimmed by a good nail file. In some cases, nails were slightly scented with aromatic oil and polished with a strip of leather. Modesty was an important virtue, so painted nails weren't welcomed. Of course, Maleficent didn't care about rules and customs. She did everything in her own way.When became calmer, Aurora returned to focus on reading just regretting not having Oscar with her. He alternated between her and the fairy. Sometimes they discussed over possession of the little dragon like two children fighting over a mascot, but most often Aurora yielded and asked Oscar to spend more time with Maleficent. She had made friends and always had someone to talk to. The fairy on the other hand, seemed to be always alone. Maybe it would be good to have a friend to keep company.Hours later, in her laboratory, Maleficent was very focused on a particular work. On the table was paper, colored paints and brushes. Oscar was perched on a small support trying not to move."Have patience. I am finishing up." She spoke without taking eyes from her work. A few more strokes to enhance the brightness of scales, one to define the contour of the wings and one more to improve shading of the bottom. Ready!When could move, Oscar stretched with satisfaction and landed over her shoulder to contemplate the work."Look, is you!" the dragon made a sound of approval. She had also loved her job and it was another great addition to her book about dragons. The drawing was placed on another table to dry along with several others which had done at different angles. As a great expert on dragons, Maleficent could draw them perfectly because knew all their anatomy. She had written several illustrated books about dragons, herbs, stones and crystals and applied magic."Um... how is the little princess?" She asked, remembering Aurora "She has been going to the library a lot and have read many books. Did she understand anything? She never seemed intelligent... no, wait! I promised not to underestimate her again."While talked, she ran the brush absently on the paper without noticing what was doing. She only realized when was passing a red brush on the lips of a beautiful young woman."I can not believe I am wasting paper and ink with this little princess." She mumbled without conviction and Oscar knew it wasn't sincere. Otherwise, she would have stopped and thrown it all away.Maleficent tried to highlight the hair that was golden as the sun. Also gave more expression to the eyes and rosy cheeks. Draw people wasn't her specialty, but the result was getting good. With a little more practice she was going to get better."I have not spent much time with her. But why should I? What stupid! I have more important things to do!" Oscar shook his head slightly. Why did this woman have to be so stubborn? Once again, she was not being honest with herself.Having that girl snooping around the library fumbled him a lot and he had to be very discreet not to get her attention, or she could tell everything to Maleficent. Why that princess decided to visit the library instead of busy herself with women's things?Maleficent was very liberal and in that region women could do whatever they wanted, to his despair. He couldn't accept they had the same rights as men, but didn't say anything because wanted to keep his position and privileges.And also because he had a plan that, if works, was going to let him filthy rich, powerful and with full control over the region. So he was going to be free to put everything as, in his opinion, should be.Georgei was his name and he had little more than fifty years. He was a tall and skinny man with wrinkled face and crooked teeth. His job was to look after the accounts and finances of the castle, work achieved after many years of struggle and sacrifice. It was very difficult to get into the castle, join of the court and prove to her how much he was able to take good care of the finances. And, of course to take the former accountant of his way. Fortunately Maleficent didn't realize the crime because death was regarded as natural.After that he had to wait and be patient to earn her trust while gathered the material and knowledge to arm the trap. The life was good in that castle, he had to admit. Maleficent had countless defects, but she wasn't miserly and paid the servants well enough to they have a good and comfortable life.An ordinary man would be very happy with this job, but he wasn't an ordinary man and didn't want to just have a roof over head and financial stability. He wanted everything: be the owner of that castle and the countless treasures that he knew Maleficent kept in a secret place. That's why he worked hard for so many years learning everything he could about magic, alchemy and potions. All his journey took him to that exact spot and was about to end in a few months.Everything went well until Aurora arrives. The princess didn't bother him or anything, but he needed to do constant researches in the library and her presence made him apprehensive. If she found out what he was doing, all his work was going to be lost."I need to keep an eye on this spoiled little princess." He always talked to himself, being careful not to make any mistake. Precaution was never enough."You needn't do it." Emma said to see Aurora cutting some vegetables."But I like be helpful.""I've never seen a princess cooking." Another maid spoke in a fun tone."It's because I lived as a peasant until sixteen years.""We know the story, girl!" Ada, the short chubby cook with elf ears, said putting the chopped vegetables in the pan. Aurora was interested.

"The legends run great distances." Emma replied. "But many things aren't true. People distort everything!""And what really happened? Do you know?"The women looked at each other for a while and Ada replied."It isn't for us to answer it. Only Maleficent can clarify everything correctly.""I asked her a few times, but she said nothing." Emma tried to reassure her."When the time comes, Her Excellency will speak everything, don't worry."Aurora didn't like much, but tried conform because it had no way to force Maleficent tell the truth. When finished the work in the kitchen, she went to her room to wait for the meal. Emma didn't take long to arrive with a tray containing her lunch."How long have you worked here?" She wanted to know.

"It's a long time. You weren't born here, were you?" Aurora had noticed that Emma's appearance was very different from other women. She had slanted eyes and her traits showed she was a foreigner.The maid shook her head."I come from a land far away, beyond the sea. My original name is Aguri, but I don't like it." "Why? It doesn't look so bad." "In your language, it means 'excess'. I was the youngest of eight children and that name means that my parents had too many kids and didn't want any more.""What happened to your family? "Emma sighed."Where I lived used to have earthquakes.""Earthquakes? It is when the earth shakes?""Yes. It's one of the most horrible thing that exists. Our house was destroyed and the entire village devastated. There was hunger, sickness and death. And I lost all my family.""I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked..." It was painful to remember those things. Emma had lost her family and had to wander alone through the rubble looking for any scrap of food. One day she was attacked by three men. She didn't know if they were looking for food or something else. To defend herself, she grabbed a large stick and fought fiercely for life. They didn't seem willing to give up, but suddenly ran at full speed.Then she looked back and came across a tall woman with sinister appearance, especially because of those horns. She carried a scepter in her hand and a crow was perched on her shoulder. Emma froze, unsure how to react. The woman said."You have determination and strength. I respect it. If you want to survive, I suggest you to follow me."It was crazy, but Emma followed her and without knowing how, they arrived at a castle, where she was cared for by some maids who taught the local language and domestic services."And I work here ever since.""Wow! Your life has changed a lot! Don't you miss your village?""Not at all. My parents didn't care about me because I was a girl and the youngest. My older brothers and sisters used to be rude to me, I had very little food and wore rags. We worked from sunrise to sunset in Feudal Lord's rice fields and we were very poor."They talked some more and Emma left the room carrying the tray, leaving Aurora thoughtful. If Maleficent was able to be generous, so she wasn't as evil as everyone told. Maybe she was just misunderstood."Think I'll try to study a little." She thought and took the material for study. There was still a lot to learn.Georgei looked at list feeling discouraged. After many years of research, he thought had finally completed the quest only to find that it was just beginning. He expected that magic was very difficult, but not so much. Heavens! It would take months to get together all the ingredients! And everything had to be millimeter perfect, otherwise the magic couldn't work."Oh, cruel life!" He muttered thinking about giving up everything. Fortunately that thought was pushed aside and his determination went back when remembered the treasures he was about to have if all went well. Think so gave more courage to keep going. "Let's see... I have to sort these ingredients in order of difficulty. The easy ones first, hardest last. Guess I'll have to travel several times, but I can't be away for long!"The man was taking notes, planning everything carefully. He still had to do more research in the library to find the exact location of each ingredient and how to collect it. Some demanded quite complicated rituals that had to be executed perfectly. Others could only be found at certain times of the year. gradually he accepted the difficulties. A powerful magic as it couldn't be easy and simple.It was with great relief that Maleficent arrived at the castle after a long day at work causing chaos in various parts of the world. Something landed on her shoulder."Greetings, little one. Where is the princess?" In response, he looked up indicating that Aurora was in her quarters. "I did not annoyed her today yet. Well, I have to fulfill all the commitments, right?"Despite the fatigue, the desire to see Aurora was stronger though she repeated to herself it was only for the pleasure of annoying the princess. She opened the bedroom door without knocking, as usual, and saw Aurora sitting at the table very focused on something."Twenty-two plus thirty-eight is... let me see... two plus three... where goes this one?" The blonde muttered to herself. Maleficent reached behind and saw that she wrote several numbers on a piece of paper. "Twenty-two plus thirty-eight is... is... fifty?""It is sixty, you foolish!"A shrill scream  echoed through the room, causing Maleficent to laugh. "Do you want to kill me?""Calm down. If I wanted, you would not have noticed anything." She ignored Aurora's frown and took the paper where she wrote. "All right you are foolish, but not knowing how to do a simple sum is absurd!""I'm not foolish!" She said taking the paper back in a brusque gesture and sitting with her face red with anger. Maleficent thought for a moment and asked."Can not you count?"Her silence was an affirmative answer."Those useless fairies did not teach you?" Aurora took a breath and answered with head down."They taught me to count a little bit, but not to sum. I'm trying to learn.""Did you learn anything?""I learned to count larger numbers, but I can only sum numbers below of ten. I'm trying to learn from a book I found in the library.""Let me see." Maleficent took the book and finally understood why Aurora was with such difficulty. She was trying to learn mathematics using a book written in Greek. It was a surprise she was able to learn something! "How are you managing to read this book?""With a dictionary. I didn't find any math book in our language. Why?"Maleficent put the book back to the table and answered in a more serious tone of voice and without cynicism."The best books are written in Greek and some in Latin.""Do you know Greek and Latin?"She looked at her as if had heard a great absurdity."Of course! I know all the languages of the present and the past." She looked at the Aurora's notes once again and saw that the young woman would take months just to learn the basic math operations."I must be going completely crazy!" She thought putting a chair next to Aurora and snarled. "Pay attention, you foolish, because I do not like to repeat the same thing hundreds of times!"Aurora gave a big smile and began to listen to the lessons that Maleficent gave showing how to add up the numbers."So that is basically it. Note the order of the numbers does not affect the result of the operation. And any number added to zero returns only the number. The zero alone does nothing. Are you paying attention?""Yes I am! And when zero comes along with other numbers?""If it is on the left, then do not worth anything. On the right, the number is multiplied by ten. I will teach you later."It was late at night when Maleficent left the room when saw that Aurora was already adding up the numbers reasonably. She planned to teach the operations of subtraction, division and multiplication next days.She went to her private chambers thoughtfully. Despite what she ever said, she knew Aurora wasn't a bit stupid or foolish. The princess was an intelligent woman who had no opportunities for study, as with many other women in this country and in other parts of the world. It was a miracle she was literate, because for many women this right was denied."She tried to learn math with a book in Greek, this is amazing!" But it also was a problem. The major works were written in Greek and Latin, languages that Aurora didn't know because those useless fairies didn't teach her nothing but berries picking.What a sad thing to have so much knowledge available and can't enjoy anything! There was no way to read those complicated books using only an old dictionary. Unless... she had an idea. A crazy idea that at first she didn't like so much. Despite having great knowledge and be able to write it in books, Maleficent had never been a good teacher because of lack of patience.On the other hand... the princess was intelligent and able to bear her difficult temper without collapsing. Not to mention it was a good excuse to spend more time with her. Finally Maleficent decided she was going to teach Greek to Aurora. Even not knowing if she would be able to learn, was worth a try."Better I plan these lessons..." 

From what he heard, she was the most powerful witch of the entire region. However, as soon as he said the words "fight with Maleficent", the old woman kicked him out of her cabin with a broom and threatened to curse him if he didn't leave quickly. Things weren't easy as he thought. Philip rode the horse and went away frustrated with another search with no results. He had looked for witches, wizards, sorcerers and none of them wanted to help him fight against Maleficent. Everyone was afraid of her."Things are getting worse and I can't do anything! What the hell!"He swore for a while until gradually calmed down. Giving up wasn't an option, since the other alternative was to sit around waiting to be deposed or beheaded and that didn't please him at all. Winning was much better."I'm not giving up no way!" He said decidedly. "This game isn't over yet and I'll be the winner!""Sing, oh goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless… hungers… upon the Achaeans.""Is 'suffering', not 'hungers'. Pay attention you foolish!" "But it is written 'peina'"Maleficent pointed the phrase with a finger and explained."You changed the letter delta by pi. It's 'suffering' and is pronounced like 'deina'. Reread and see that makes sense."Aurora did it and really made much more sense. She read the rest without mistakes, to her relief. Studying under many scoldings and recriminations wasn't good!It had been three months since Aurora was studying Greek, which wasn't easy. Not by the language but because of Maleficent. She was very demanding, severe, had little tolerance for mistakes and hardly any patience to teach. The lessons were held in the library using a rare basic grammar book she had purchased especially for Aurora.Over time, Maleficent saw that the princess was intelligent and learned easily as long as she was taught correctly, which the fairy was learning after some trial and error. And she respected Aurora for persisting without falling apart. Anyone would be in pieces."Enough for today, I have appointments shortly. I will let some lessons and I demand everything to be very well done."The lessons was closed and Aurora returned to her room."How was lessons?" Emma asked."Very good, I'm reading much better.""How nice!"When Aurora told her she was going take Greek lessons with Maleficent, the first thing the maid talked about was."Gods helps you!"She didn't believe the princess was able to learn something from someone as hard as Maleficent. But time passed and everything was going well, to everyone's surprise. Nobody had ever seen the fairy caring so much to someone that way.Stefan read the letter from Philip feeling sad and discouraged. King Hubert had just passed away a few weeks, further aggravating the crisis the kingdom was going through and the king of the neighboring kingdom was about to declare war. Everyone was under threat, except his kingdom because of Maleficent's protection. What an irony! She was both a plague and also their salvation.Philip asked for an alliance, but Stefan didn't want to get involved in unnecessary war to protect a coward who wasn't able to defeat Maleficent and left them to be kidnapped, trowed in a dungeon and humiliated. Because of this, they lost Aurora who had to stay in their place as wicked fairy's prisoner.Five months have passed since they were freed by Maleficent in exchange for letting Aurora in their place and his heart was broken to imagine his daughter living in a tiny cell, starving, wearing rags and maybe ill. He was sure that evil creature was torturing her every day.The fairies didn't live in the palace, but in a beautiful cabin in the middle of the forest. Since Aurora was no longer living in the palace, they saw no sense in staying there. The mood of sadness and desolation was too much for them."I still think we should rescue her!" Merryweather said dissatisfied. "If we did this for Philip, why can not we do for her?""Because she volunteered to stay with Maleficent." Flora said. Merryweather wasn't convinced."She only did that to save her parents! I bet the poor child is suffering!"Fauna, which until then was silent, spoke looking out the window."Their fates are connected and we always knew that."The other two made a frown of displeasure. She didn't care."We tried to avoid it, but fate had a way to beat us.""This fate is too cruel!" Merryweather complained."There are things we can change. Others must take its course. Perhaps the case of Aurora and Maleficent is one of those. We should never have tried to separate them." She finished with a sigh, remembering the day of the christening, when Maleficent gave that gift to Aurora.The fairy had no intention to harm the baby, but no one understood what Maleficent meant and everyone thought the little Aurora was being cursed to become as cruel as she was, including the three fairies. Deep down they knew that wasn't true, but they were so full of prejudices against Maleficent and acted like everyone else.She still remembered the expression of Maleficent, soft and calm as she had never seen before. Despite not being invited, even with the hostility around her, she was gentle with the baby.The green fairy saw when Maleficent approached the cradle and with a gesture of her hands, made that strange circle appeared in the air. Half was white and the other black. The circle was divided in half and the white part was with Aurora while she kept black one. What no one saw, and she had very well, was Aurora smiling and extending one little hand. Maleficent touched her hand with one finger and smiled at her tenderly. At that very moment Fauna thought there was something good inside that creature of darkness.But nobody saw anything good, just a wicked fairy who wanted to curse the poor princess, so she was harassed and had to go away because the soldiers threatened to attack and she have found it better to withdraw than to start a fight and harm the baby."I do not know why you think it is good their fate be connected!" Flora protested pulling her out of the memories."We do not know what happens in Maleficent's castle. Our girl can be good.""I do not believe it!" Merryweather said crossing his arms."Me too!" Flora agreed.Fauna just sighed and kept looking at the landscape. Oh, fairies with so little faith!The earthquake happened as she had planned. The area was uninhabited, so there were no casualties. The earthquake was of high intensity, but she was successfull to keep it under control and avoid a greater tragedy on the planet. Manage the chaos wasn't easy! Maleficent watched the destroyed landscape and saw that everything had changed, as well as her life. A big change happened in a way she never imagined.She could never imagine herself teaching Greek to someone and now she was teaching Aurora every day, when her appointments allowed. And despite the setbacks, the lessons were enjoyable. In recent days Aurora greatly improved, which decreases her reprimands against the young woman. Anyway, she tried to control her bad temper.Still looking at the landscape, she remembered a day when was teaching writing to Aurora. This day was special."I̱ thri̱skeía kánei stous anthró̱pous tría prágmata:̱ Tous diaireí, tous elénchei kai tous paraplaná." She recited calmly walking to and fro with hands behind her back. Aurora struggled to write everything correctly. "Let me see. This letter is wrong. The line should be pulled up higher."She leaned over and held firmly Aurora's hand leading the movements slowly. Although showing naturalness, she felt like was boiling inside. Their faces were relatively close and the princess's smell invaded her nostrils in a heady and permanently way, as if went into her lungs and spreading through the body. It was a sweet, fresh and pleasant smell she inhaled hungrily taking advantage of the few moments of closeness."It is better." She said pulling away to see that Aurora had managed to write the letters correctly. Too bad...Being with the princess was getting more and more pleasant and Maleficent couldn't go a day without see her at least a little. Otherwise, her mood was ten times worse.Inside his room he checked the ingredients he had gathered so far, the work of many years. To defeat someone like Maleficent, it was necessary a great power and everything had to be perfect. He had only one chance and couldn't fail, otherwise she would slay him with no mercy."Some ingredients are missing. Let's see..." he reread the list and saw that some ingredients were very rare and hard to find. One was a flower that only born every hundred years in a very far away mountain.Another ingredient was a bottle of water from source of Nile River taken on the night of new moon during a rare alignment between some constellations. What the hell! He needed to travel to Egypt? There was no alternative. Without it, his work was lost.The man gave an exasperated sigh, resigned to the situation."Well, the quicker I take these providences, the better." He checked an ancient mystical calendar and saw that the flower was going to bloom within a few days. So he'd better hurry or would never have another chance.He checked his savings and his gold coins were enough just for three or four months if he was very economical. As much as it hurt to see his money leaving,  that it was an investment for future. An infinitely greater wealth awaited him."You should not walk barefoot." Maleficent said to Aurora who walked without a care."I like feel the grass under my feet. In the palace, I couldn't do it!""I do not see anything interesting in dirtying the feet.""It's not dirt. Is grass! Wow, this tree is so beautiful!"Aurora ran to the large central tree, which was surrounded with beautiful flowering shrubs, very green grass and some rocks filled with moss and bromeliads."This tree has about three hundred years.""Really? A tree can live so long?""Some trees have more than four thousand years old.""It's a long time! Was this tree here when you built the castle?""It was a small tree, with half a meter."Aurora walked around the tree contemplating the thick trunk and wide treetop which seemed to protect the whole garden. Suddenly, a sharp pain hit one of her bare feet."Ouch! What's it?" She sat down to look the foot and saw that had stepped on a thorn. Maleficent knelt to examine her."I told to be careful, you foolish! There are many thorny plants in this garden."The young woman made a pout to mask the pain."Let me see. Easy, it is not a poisonous thorn." She grabbed her foot with one hand and gently pulled the thorn with her index finger and thumb. "Done. The thorn did not spike deep. From here on, take more care. Some plants are poisonous.""Why don't you sit down too? This grass is soft!""Do you want me to sit on the ground? What nonsense!""You're kneeling. What difference does it make?"Maleficent made her traditional frown, hesitated for a while and finally sat down awkwardly. Her large cape didn't make things any easier."It's very good, isn't it?""It is strange!" She said uncomfortably, because never was in such a low position before.Aurora looked at her and smiled. Her cape was really large and was scattered around. A person could sleep on it easily. Still, it was a beautiful sight. Even though sitting on the ground, Maleficent's presence had power to fascinate and intimidate."Relax once in a while is good. You work hard!""I am not used to relax." She spoke quietly, not wanting to admit that was loving being with Aurora without any concern."If you want, we can sit on the bench.""Yes, I do. I sat on the grass too long."She stood up, followed by Aurora and they went to the bank below the two trees together, their favorite place. The princess went ahead following Oscar.A young man was in the garden and saw Aurora running after that little dragon. So he decided to take advantage of that she was alone to go talk to her."Princess Aurora, good afternoon!""Uh... good afternoon Hans...""I don't want being indiscreet, but I'd like to invite you to... to..." he stopped talking and froze to see Maleficent coming behind her looking like she wanted to kill him. Damn, he hadn't seen the fairy was with her!"What do you want with her?" The woman asked sharply."I... I... (gasp) just wanted to invite the princess for a ride and... and...""Get out of my face before I turn you into ashes!"The young man got out there running at full speed, leaving Aurora annoyed."You needn't have spoken to him like that!""You did not intend to accept his invitation, did you? I hope not!""And if I wanted to?" Aurora asked cheekily."I do not allow!""Why? It was just a ride!"Maleficent didn't want to admit it, but she wasn't liking it one bit to see the men of the castle courting Aurora. They were increasingly cheeky!"I will not allow it and the conversation is over!" She said turning back and before leaving, finished. "Remember you are my prisoner!"She went away leaving Aurora without understanding anything. The ride was so good, why Maleficent ruined everything acting that way? What was wrong being interested in a man? Ah, of course. She was a prisoner and couldn't have the same rights as other residents. Think so did her heart ache. After so many months living in the castle, it was the first time Maleficent reminded her she was a prisoner. Until then, she didn't feel like that anymore.Without any more desire to continue the ride, she went to her room brooding over her sorrows. Her day was totally ruined."I do not believe I said that!" Maleficent said walking from one side to another. "Is she very upset?"Oscar nodded, making her feel worse. Why should she care? She had told the truth! Besides, she would never accept the princess was interested in a man. If that happened, what was next? Marriage? Children? Only over her dead body! She was willing to allow Aurora to do anything, except to get involved with someone else.But she didn't understand why it bothered her. Just thinking about Aurora falling in love with someone made her heart ached and she didn't know how to handle it. On the other hand, she was upset they have quarreled. It was time to fix things.In her room, Aurora was venting with Emma about that incident."Why did she do it? Why?""Well..." she thought some answers and finally didn't had the courage to tell her opinion. Aurora hadn't been able to understand by herself, so touching that subject could be tricky. "I think she meant no harm.""She said I'm a prisoner!""And are you not?"Aurora gasped a little and answered upset."I am, but she doesn't treat me like that for several months! Why has it changed now? What's wrong if I fall in love with someone? Why does she care?"Emma scratched her head. Right, that princess was still quite naive for some things. Fortunately, the sound of someone knocking on the door saved her. It was the milliner of the castle holding a beautiful green and black dress embroidered with some silver wires."Her Excellence sent you this gift." He said handing the dress."Now I don't understand anything!""There's nothing to understand! It's her way of apologizing! C'mon, try this dress! It's too beautiful!" Emma encouraged.The dress fitted perfectly and Aurora agreed that it was really beautiful. The green tone was the same of Maleficent's magic and matched very well with black. The silver wires broke the seriousness of clothing.Seeing that Aurora still seemed upset, Emma advised."Don't worry about it! You know how she can be hard to understand sometimes.""Yes... I know."Oscar entered the room and looked quite excited."What's up, my little baby?""I think he wants you to follow him.""Now?" The dragon flew, showing the matter was urgent. Aurora followed him and they went up to the top of the castle, where were the watchtowers. She had never gone up there before.It was night and she saw someone else there. Maleficent turned and looked her up and down showing visible delight in her eyes. Both were silent and none of them found something to say. Finally, Aurora decided to do away with that unpleasant situation. After all, Maleficent was what she was. There was no alternative but to accept."Thanks for the dress. It's beautiful!""You are welcome." She replied smiling and held out a hand showing the sky. "I wanted you to see it."The princess was stunned to see the most beautiful starry sky she had seen before."It's incredible! How many stars! How I never noticed before?""Tonight is new moon, it becomes easier to see the stars. And I also ordered everyone turn their lights off so you could see the sky better."In fact, all the lights were off not only the castle but also in all village. Maleficent had done everything for her?"It's so beautiful! I don't know what to say! Thank you!""No need to thank. Just enjoy it."They remained there for a long time, looking at the sky while Maleficent showed her the constellations. Aurora was gradually forgetting the incident that day. It wasn't worth getting upset about such trifles.Maleficent was happy to see that the princess had forgotten that unpleasant incident. Still, she didn't intend to let her get involved with anyone."I will watch her carefully from now on." The fairy thought looking her beautiful face. She was hers and hers alone. 

Was she crazy? Lost her mind? Was getting stupid? All at the same time?"I think I am getting sick! That is it! It should be some strange disease I still do not know! I need to go to the laboratory to find out what this is and make some antidote!"Oscar shook his head, saying it wasn't a disease."If I am not sick, so what is my problem?"Earlier, Aurora talk to her very happy and excited about a party that the villagers made every year to celebrate the harvest and she also wanted to join."I said you can not leave this castle." Maleficent replied dryly."Unless you allow! Is why I am asking your permission! Oh, please!""You said it right: unless I allow it. And I am not allowing.""Why? It's just a party in the village! I swear won't try to escape!"Allow Aurora walking through the village away from her surveillance? What if she met any man and fall in love with him? What if they try to run away together? What if... her head teemed with so many "What if" and no way she was going to allow Aurora leave the castle. Even more because she knew there were taverns in the village and was afraid of Aurora repeat that same behavior."Emma will go with me, no need to worry! You can even send a guard to watch over me and...""I said no!" Maleficent shouted losing the patience and soon regretted to see the expression on Aurora's face. She had never yelled with her like that before. But as she didn't want to give in, she decided only use her authority. "I gave my final word. If you keep insisting this idiocy, I will forbid the party of villagers. Do you want it?""Would you?""You bet I do, princess!""So you really are a very bad person!""Be careful how you talk to me! I can still send you to the dungeon!""Then do it! I'm not afraid!" Aurora also yelled with red face in anger. She couldn't let this woman intimidate her in any way.Maleficent took a deep breath to keep calm and ordered."Go to your room and just get out there when I order!"Aurora went away with the head held high and stomping. When she was alone, the fairy collapsed on throne rubbing her face with one hand. Heavens... she did it again! What was happening to her lately?Those discussions were becoming more frequent than she wanted. First was that incident of the garden. Another day she saw Aurora chatting with a guy in the castle courtyard and made a big scandal. After she fired several rays that broke a wall when Aurora praised the beauty of a knight. Also had that time the princess walked in the garden with a minister's nephew, talking about a book she had read. She almost threw that castle down!Poor Emma, who had one shoulder soaked with Aurora's tears."She did it again, Emma! Again! What's happening to her?""Well… you know...""She's complicated, I know that! But today she has crossed the line! Do you believe she even threatened to send me to the dungeon?""You faced her!""I won't accept she mistreats me that way! I'm tired of living stuck here and can't go anywhere! At least in my father's palace I could escape from time to time!""But couldn't do a thousand other things! Well, we can't have everything, right?"Aurora sat up in bed feeling totally exhausted. In the end, Emma was Maleficent's maid. It wasn't fair expect her to turn against her employer. Without having something else to do, she reached down and pulled something from under the bed."Where'd you get it?""From cellar. They always give me wine when I ask." She answered taking a big swig from the bottle, leaving Emma worried because she had realized that Aurora drank more than a lady in her age would do."I think you shouldn't overdo... this wine can be strong!""And what else can I do? Now I'm locked here like the first time!"The blonde took other big gulps from the bottle and Emma didn't know what to do. She imagined it was difficult to live trapped unable to walk freely, but alcohol wasn't the solution to problems."You can leave, I want to be alone." Aurora said showing being slightly drunk."Maybe I should take the bottle..."A few more gulps were taken and the bottle was completely emptied."You can take it, I'll sleep now."Emma left the room thinking maybe talking to Maleficent about that problem.Maleficent was still fighting with herself and her thoughts. Why was she acting that way? Why she was so afraid if Aurora fell in love with someone? That shouldn't bother her, should it?"What nonsense, she can fall in love with anyone, I do not care!"She stroked Oscar's wings for a while and then roared."She can not never do this! I will not allow no way!" After realizing what had said, she got confused again. "What is happening to me?"Oscar took a few laps, opened and closed the wings, shook his tail and Maleficent stood up almost breathing fire."No way! This is absurd! Foolishness, idiocy, madness!"The woman walked from one side to another cursing, gesturing sharply and occasionally shooting some rays with her scepter. When finally calmed down, she sat again and asked."Do you really think I am... am..." her lips refused to utter that word and she had to make a big effort. "jealous?"The dragon agreed."But I am not jealous of anyone! This is stupid! She can even marry, I do not care!"A minute of silence passed and Maleficent shouted again."She will not marry with anyone! Never! Never and… why are you looking at me like that? I said I am not jealous!"Oscar sighed. How she could be so stubborn that way? Well, it was expected someone like Maleficent had many difficulties to understand her own feelings, especially feelings she never had before. Maybe she just needed time to think."You didn't bring wine!" Aurora complained when Emma brought the lunch."I think you've had enough for today!""How am I supposed to eat without wine?" She went to the bedroom and came back with another bottle, making Emma widen her eyes."What? How many bottles of wine do you have under your bed?""I have my private stash for emergencies." She took a good swig from the bottle and continued to eat."You shouldn't drink so much! This can make you sick! Look, try to have a little patience. Maleficent quarrels, but then...""Send me a idiot gift thinking she can bribe me! I got tired of it!"Discuss with Aurora was useless. The princess was drunk and didn't know what was talking about. When could collect the tray, she thought better tell to Maleficent what was happening.Maleficent was busy with an important matter, but when the maid said something serious was going on with Aurora, the fairy dismissed everyone and heard what she had to say."And that's it, your Excellency." Emma finished. "Did you know she was taking so much wine?""During meals she likes to drink two or three glasses, but I didn't know she was keeping so many bottles under the bed, I swear!""So I must take care of it immediately!"Maleficent went to Aurora's room and found her lying on the couch with a emptied bottle on the floor. What was up with that young woman? How long it was happening?Aurora opened her eyes slowly and blinked confusedly."What are you doing here?" Asked with slurred voice."What THIS bottle is doing there? How much did you drink today?""None of your business!" She got up, went to the room unsteadily and took another bottle under the bed. Before Maleficent could stop her, she drank much of the liquid from the bottle and wiped her mouth with the back of the hand."Are you crazy? Give this to me now!""Not even it I can do? Leave me alone, I'm sick of it all, damn it!"Emma was called and Maleficent ordered to take off all bottles of that room. To her surprise, there were still at least five or six bottles under the bed and she decided to have a serious conversation with who was guarding the cellar for giving such a large amount of wine to Aurora."I want out, I want to fly! I'm not a bird to be stuck!" She spoke opening her arms and running across the room. Maleficent held her tightly and said."You will have a bath now!""I don't want take a bath, I wanna fly! Be free! Let me go!" She struggled several times without getting rid of fairy's strong hug.Maleficent gave some ingredients and ordered Emma made a tea to help get the alcohol from Aurora's body and also ordered herbs to put in bath water. Before long, the maid returned with a teapot and it was with difficulty that Maleficent made Aurora take a few sips."Drink, you need!""I don't want tea! I want wine!"When Aurora finally drained the cup, she felt something strange in stomach and was whisked to the bathroom. In an instant she expelled all the wine that had drunk along with lunch. She was dizzy, her head ached terribly and could barely balance. Maleficent had to hold her so she wouldn't fall in the toilet."She put everything out. Now help me take her clothes off." With maid's help, she took off the Aurora's dress, which had become dirty, and plunged her in the bathtub with hot water and various herbs to help get the alcohol from her body."Will she be fine, Your Excellency?""After a few days, yes. She ingested a large amount of wine and will take some time until her body recovers."After the bath, they donned Aurora with a clean nightdress and Maleficent laid her on the bed, covering with blankets."Bring me an empty bucket and other containing the infusion of herbs used in the bath. After that, you are excused. I will take care of her tonight.""If you want, I can help.""No need. She will remain unconscious until tomorrow."After fulfilling orders, Emma withdrew leaving Maleficent alone with Aurora. So the fairy had much time to think about what was happening."Why did not I realize this before?" She asked softly to Oscar. He lay down on the bed beside Aurora, also worried. "I should have known that something like this could happen."Aurora had a part of her within herself. Maleficent was restless and didn't like living trapped or limited. So it was obvious the princess was also like her. Keep her stuck inside that castle was an mistake. On the other hand, she was afraid to let the princess free and she run away."I do not want her to go away... but I can not leave her stuck here forever. What should I do?"Oscar flew to the dresser and pointed to a drawer with the tail. Maleficent realized he wanted to show her something. Inside the drawer there was a jewelry box and her body shuddered when she opened it and saw the jewel she had given to Aurora on the day of her baptism. How did she get the jewel? Surely the fairies gave to her."Was she keeping it the whole time?"The pendant was carefully made by her using a metal found in an unknown continent which would only be used several centuries later, under the name of platinum. The stone was black tourmaline and perfectly highlighted in white metal. Maleficent held the pendant close to the chest and immersed in her thoughts. Around her neck, under her clothes, had an identical jewel, but all black thanks to a very complicated process of alchemy and the stone was a diamond.Knowing that Aurora kept pendant made her a bit calmer."She never showed desire to flee, is not it?" Oscar shook his head. "Still I need to be careful!" He landed on her shoulder, flew around and then landed again.She understood it might be better to give more freedom to Aurora. Keep her trapped could make her want to run away. Still Maleficent didn't want make that decision yet. Her priority was to take care of the princess and the jewel was saved in jewelry box.The fairy sat in a chair near the bed and occasionally wet a cloth in the bucket with the infusion of herbs and put over young woman's forehead. Aurora got to wake up sometimes with the stomach sick and Maleficent made her vomit in the bucket. After the she went back to sleep in a restless sleep. She was shaking, sweating and sometimes muttering nonsense words that Maleficent couldn't understand. It was a long night.Her head ached as if had a rodent churning inside wanting to get out. Aurora had never felt so bad in her life, even when she used to drank beer. With great difficulty, she opened one eye, then the other and saw Maleficent's face above her coming into focus."What happened?" She whispered with difficulty. Two fingers were placed on her lips."Try not to talk too much. You need to rest. ""My head...""Shhh... Emma will bring something light to you eat."The maid came with a vegetable broth and Maleficent made Aurora eat a bit hoping this time she didn't put anything out. After she took her to the bathroom to make her physiological needs and once again the fairy made her take some more tea."Make more tea and give her every hour." She said after Aurora sleep again. "Stay with her today and do not leave for anything. Another maid will do your work. I will come to see her after lunch.""Yes, Your Excellency."As she had some unfinished business, she went to the throne room and ordered to one of her aides."Call Georgei. I demand to see the accounting reports."Another person entered the throne room, making her exclaim indignantly."What are you doing here? Where is Georgei?" The man replied nervously."He traveled, Your Excellency, and left me in charge of taking care of the finances.""What? I do not remember having given permission for it!"He was waiting patiently. If that plan worked, he soon could have enough gold to finish his project. When the King finally finished talking with some ministers, decided to give attention that unusual visitor. Normally he wouldn't have bothered to receive an old and ugly man, but knowing he came from Forbidden Lands piqued his curiosity."What brings you here?" King Aragon asked scratching his beard. He was about thirty-two tall and strong man with very blond hair and green eyes. He was quite handsome, but his face was cruel."Your Majesty, my name is Georgei and I come from Forbidden Lands. I'm official Maleficent's accountant.""Maleficent? Did she send you?" he asked even more intrigued by this visit. He, like everyone else, knew Maleficent and her great power. It was because of her that he never dared to invade the Stefan's kingdom."Yes Majesty, I work for Maleficent, but she doesn't knows I'm here.""So tell right away what you want and stop wasting my time!"He took a breath and told his plan to defeat Maleficent once and for all. The king heard all scratching his beard, a gesture very common to him."So if Your Majesty accepts this deal, we'll profit greatly!"The deal was very simple. That man had a plan and needed gold to execute it until the end. The ingredients for that enchantment was expensive and he was without resources. In exchange, he was going to defeat Maleficent and leave the way free for him to conquer the Stefan's kingdom without great difficulty. His army was very powerful and able to win that war as long as Maleficent didn't interfere. She was his biggest concern."And in return you only want gold?""And also the control over Forbidden Lands. You can get all the rest of the kingdom, which is very broad and has underground natural resources."The king's eyes glowed with greed."Are you talking about gold?""Gold, silver, precious stones... those people still don't know the real amount of wealth they have underfoot, so most of that treasure is untapped!"That proposal was getting better! Have a great threat away from his way and to conquer a kingdom full of riches! Everything seemed so easy that he mistrusted."Why did you come to propose it for me and not for King Stefan?""Because he knows if Maleficent is defeated, his kingdom will be unprotected.""You could have made this proposal to Philip, who is king now.""His kingdom is on the verge of bankruptcy. An intelligent man should look for strong and powerful allies, do not you think?"Those arguments made sense. He had great treasures conquered thanks to the annexed territories. Give some to defeat Maleficent and conquer a kingdom full of precious metals and stones seemed to be a very small price. In the end, both was going to earn a lot with that bargain."Are you sure your plan will work?""I'm absolutely sure, Majesty! With your help, Maleficent'll be defeated before the winter solstice this year. It is the time I need to gather the other ingredients and prepare the enchantment.""If you fulfill your promise, I'll conquer the Stefan's kingdom and spare the forbidden lands. But if it fails, you'll pay dearly! I don't like being tricked!"He smiled showing crooked teeth."If I fail, she'll slaughter me without mercy. I believe that nothing will be left for you. But I guarantee this plan will work perfectly.""You'll have all necessary gold." He said finally. "But I want to be present when you use the enchantment and so cut her head off with my own sword! I'll be the man who killed Maleficent!""Quite agree, majesty. Quite agree!" Georgei replied feeling the pleasure of victory.

"What is it?" Aurora asked when Emma put on the table a bowl of soup full of colorful vegetables and pieces of meat."A soup from my homeland. It's good for those who are convalescing, gives health and strength.""The smell is good. Hmm... and the taste too! It's chicken soup?"Emma giggled and replied."Actually, it's snake soup." The blonde nearly choked on a piece of meat."Snake soup? Are you giving me snake soup? I'll die poisoned!""You silly, there's no danger if prepared correctly. It's very good for health. Eat all, I also brought rice with umeboshi."She didn't understand and Emma had to say the word several times before Aurora could pronounce it."I've never heard!""It is very good for colds, flu and also who was hungover because of the sake.""Where did you get these things?""Her Excellency brought from across the world and I have prepared."Aurora stopped eating and asked."Did she do this for me?""Yes. And took care of you all night. She was very worried!"Is that really true? Maleficent had been worried to the point of take care of her all night? Her conscience hurt a little to have said the day before she was a bad person."She really likes you.""Do you think?""Everybody thinks so. She would never do for anyone what does for you. Not even a tenth.""So why has she been acting this way with me? ""Maybe she's afraid of you run away. She doesn't want to lose you.""But why is she so afraid I fall in love with someone?""For the same reason, I think."Seeing the princess didn't understand, the maid said."Have patience with her. She isn't used to like someone so much and doesn't know how to show her feelings.""So she needs to learn because is hurting me!""It's not so easy, be patient with her and in time she will learn. Gradually things will balance out.""Do you think?""Yes. Now eat it before the food gets cold.""All right." Aurora took a few more spoonfuls of soup and said. "She shouldn't be afraid that I fell in love. I'll never stop being her friend!"Emma didn't answer. Apparently, Aurora hadn't understood the meaning of her words.After lunch, Aurora dozed a little and when wake up, decided to read that book about Tristan and Isolde she always wanted to read."I can not believe you are reading this depressing thing!" Maleficent said appearing suddenly and sitting on the edge of the bed. Aurora was indignant."Depressing? I heard it's a beautiful love story!""They die in the end and never get together."She closed the book and complained angrily."You spoiled my reading!""Do not waste your time reading it. It has a lot of tragedy in real life. Believe me, I cause a lot of them."However much she tried get angry, Aurora just laughed."I see you are better. Then I can apply that proof of Latin which is delayed for several days.""Ohhh, I'm dying again!" Aurora said trying to pretend sick."It is not time to die, you foolish! Stand up, a walk in the garden will do you good, you need breathe clean air."After help the princess to change clothes, they went to the garden. Maleficent offered her an arm when saw she still had a little trouble walking and within minutes they were sitting at their preferred place. Aurora breath, glad to leave the room after those moments of torture."How are you?""Weird. I felt like drinking wine all day and my body trembles!""This is called a withdrawal crisis. You are addicted to alcohol and your body misses when you don't drink..""So I should drink a little."Maleficent shook her head and spoke very serious."I think you should not drink never again.""Never again? Why?""You can not control yourself with alcohol and in the long-term it is very bad for human body.""But it always helped me feel better." Maleficent cupped her chin, making Aurora look her in the eye."For thousands of years I see humans using alcohol and similar things to solve their problems in various parts of the world. Do you know something?""What?""It never worked for anyone, at any time. These people only sunk into addiction and ruined their lives. I do not want it for you."Aurora felt a pleasant warmth in her chest when she thought that Maleficent really liked her."So... I won't drink any more, but don't know if I can do it!""Yes, you can. All residents and employees of this castle are forbidden to give you any kind of alcoholic beverage. I did this for your own good, you understand me?"Her body trembled slightly and her eyes filled with tears. But she understood."Yes...""The first days can be very difficult and I will do my best to help you. But you also have to help yourself. Without your willpower, nothing can be done.""I promise. And when I promise, I fulfill!""I know."They stood in silence, looking the beautiful garden landscape. At least Aurora, because Maleficent would rather look at her face. She was pale and with dark circles under the eyes. And there was sadness in those beautiful eyes, which made her give a slight sigh. That young woman was slowly dying and she couldn't let it happen. She had to do something and see Oscar flying through the garden gave her a great idea.Several days later, Maleficent was waiting impatiently in the throne room."You sent for me, your Excellency?" Georgei asked nervously."Yes. I know you have traveled too often in recent months. What is happening? You have obligations to fulfill in this castle!""I know very well, but had to resolve some family issues and..."The woman narrowed the eyes and for a moment he was afraid of wetting his pants."If you are unable to fulfill your obligations, then tell me at once so I can find a substitute. I will not accept you leave your duties to travel around.""Do not worry, Your Excellency, I can take care of my duties perfectly and the trips are no longer needed!" He said with a fake tone of humility that Maleficent noticed."I am watching, you worm. If you are plotting something, I promise throw you in the dungeon at once! Now get out of my face!"He made some bows and went away desiring to strangle that woman with all his strength. She was so arrogant, so sure of herself and didn't know what was about to happen to her!"I'll spit in your face several times before that king cut off your head. You can wait!" He thought leaving the throne room. That was going to be the happiest day of his life!The recovery was painful. Aurora had several bouts of abstinence and Maleficent helped giving soothing teas or distracting her with other things. Emma was always with her to watch. Nearly a month passed before she felt better."Do you know what she's planning?" Aurora asked Emma who helped her to dress."Calm down, you'll find out soon."After buttoning up the dress, she combed princess's hair and said."Done, you can go. She is waiting and you know...""Maleficent hates to wait. Well, see you later!"Aurora ran into the courtyard of the castle where Maleficent had arranged to meet with her. The courtyard was completely empty, which was unusual at that time of morning. Where was everyone?"Hi, Oscar! What is going on?"Her mascot looked up and Aurora heard a roar from the sky. Her eyes widened at seeing a brown dragon with silvery spots flying in circles over the castle. The creature was descending gradually until landing softly in the middle of the courtyard. Riding on its back, sitting a large saddle, was none other than Maleficent. Aurora looked as if hypnotized for the magnificent scene of the fairy riding that dangerous beast and holding the reins as if she had full control of everything."Will you just look?" she asked giving that smirk."This is... is... Wow!" The woman held out a hand and said."Happy birthday, princess."Aurora was speechless for a few seconds and then asked with a trembling voice."My birthday? It's today?""Oh, you foolish! Forgot your own birthday! Come on! It is much more fun ride the dragon than just look with this silly face."She came out of that shock and held Maleficent's hand, who lifted her off the ground and helped to ride behind her."Hold me tight. The takeoff is usually difficult, so be careful!"Oscar settled down in front of Maleficent, who with a flick of the reins caused the dragon take off at an incredible speed, catching Aurora by surprise. More than fast, she hugged the fairy tightly, pressing her body against hers and closed the eyes. Maleficent, on the other hand, had no difficulty in staying firmly despite the high speed of the dragon. She controlled the beast with great mastery."I said takeoff is difficult. Keep holding tight!" After the initial turmoil, it wasn't necessary the princess hugged her so hard, but Maleficent was loving that physical contact between them. It was so good to feel the princess' body pressed to hers, those arms around her waist and those firm breasts against her back. She could also feel her heart beating, and after a while, it seemed to beat in tune with her own.When the dragon's speed slowed, Aurora opened her eyes and saw with wonder they were flying near the clouds. Below them, the gorgeous landscape of Forbidden Lands throughout its length. Maleficent's lands were much bigger than she thought and could ever be considered as a kingdom."Look how close the clouds are! There's no danger to be shocked against them?""Of course not! Clouds are only tiny particles of water and ice. It does not hurt anyone. Want to see?""My goodness!" the blonder exclaimed when the dragon went through a big cloud. Everything clouded around and cleared again. "We went through a cloud? I can't believe!""You can believe, princess. Come on, we still have many things to see!"Maleficent flew over the great plains and also the snowy peaks of several mountains where Aurora could see white dragons flying around."Snow dragons would rather cold places.""And here is really cold!"The dragon was flying at a high speed and Maleficent was leading making it seem very easy which in fact wasn't. Looking from above, Aurora saw that most of the lands were uninhabited, with only a few villages and some areas of planting."I try to avoid human occupation. Otherwise, all this would be devastated like happens in other kingdoms.""But people need to eat..." Aurora justified."There are more efficient ways to cultivate the soil without devastate large areas. Moreover, humans breed like rats and cause the destruction of everything around. Destroying forests, the climate is affected.""I didn't know...""People also do not know. It will take ages to they understand it and even then the destruction will not be stopped easily. But let us leave this matter aside. Today is your day!"The tour lasted for over an hour so Aurora could see the Forbidden Lands from above. They traveled to the frontier, where the forest planted by Flora was."I never understood why they did this forest."Maleficent replied showing displeasure."They want everyone to believe Forbidden Lands are a horrible place to live, so this forest don't allow people to go through the frontier and see everything by themselves."The dragon stood in the air for some time, flapping without going anywhere and Aurora could see, far, the silhouette of the palace and felt sadness. More than fast she pushed that thought out of her mind not to ruin her day."There is a place I want to show you. I know you will like." the dragon went away quickly and once again Aurora was amazed to see a beautiful crystal clear lake surrounded by pine trees which in addition the green color, also exhibited amber and some shades of brown and red. Behind the pine trees had mountains with snow capped peaks.The beast landed on the shore of lake which was covered with grass and plants with yellow and purple flowers. Maleficent down first and then helped Aurora holding her by the waist. The young woman, in turn, rested the hands on her shoulders and when was placed on the ground, their bodies became very close.Maleficent kept the hands on her waist, looking at those beautiful eyes that were sometimes blue, sometimes slightly violet. Aurora held her gaze feeling the heart pounding in chest. They were almost embraced."It's the most beautiful gift I got! Thank you very much!" She said with flushed face and bright eyes."You are welcome, princess." She slowly released her and the two were walking along the lake shore. Oscar flew freely, circling in the air and having fun.They walked in a calm and comfortable silence for both, just enjoying each other's company. Aurora breathed deeply the fresh air feeling invigorated by leave the castle after months of confinement. A large mountain behind pine trees caught her eye."That mountain looks different from the others.""It is a volcano.""Really? It doesn't seem to.""Because it is inactive.""It doesn't erupt anymore?""In that case, would be extinct. An inactive volcano can stay years without activity and erupt at any time.""This happened in the past?""Yes. This volcano erupted and covered the entire kingdom with lava.""Really? I've never heard!""It happened countless millennia ago, long before people inhabit this kingdom."Aurora was amazed."How do you know so much?" Maleficent gave her typical arrogant smirk."I have lived long enough to learn.""It must have been terrible when this volcano erupted. I hope it never happens again!"She stopped walking and held out her arms, as if showing around the landscape."See those lands? It is beautiful, is not it? All this was only possible because of this great 'tragedy' of the past. The volcanic soil is one of the most fertile in the world. It is thanks to it this country never had a food shortage .""I hadn't thought so."She gave a bitter smile."Nobody thinks. People always see tragedies like something bad. Maybe it is the short term, but that is how nature works."Aurora finally understood what Maleficent meant."Chaos is as necessary as the order. It is where stars are born. Everything that exists today and will exist comes from chaos. People hate me because they want to live stagnant, but I make them come out of comfort zone. No one likes change.""I liked the change."The fairy lowered the arms and looked at princess' face. She was sincere and her gaze had fascination, admiration and respect. There was no hatred, anger or fear as always happened with other people. She really liked the way to look."Oscar!" Aurora squeaked suddenly when the little dragon flew grazing over her head. He came back and Maleficent said."It seems he wants to play.""You naughty! I'll catch you!" She went away chasing the dragon which flew quickly, sometimes stopping so she could join him.Seeing Aurora running with Oscar, so beautiful and smiling, her heart beat in a way that had never beaten before causing her to put a hand on chest. Which meant that strange feeling that was dominating her? Why was her chest so warm? No, it couldn't be true! Was that possible? She refused to believe. Suddenly, it was as if a veil had been lifted from her eyes and finally she can see the reality.Where that feeling come from? When it started? She didn't know. Everything happened without her noticing, slowly and gradually. Or that feeling has always been inside, but asleep? Maybe she could never know. It was out of her control and if there was one thing she hated was not being able to control something.It wasn't easy for her accept that feeling. If it were anyone else, she would never take it forward. In fact, she wasn't even able to feel such a thing for anyone else. But that was Aurora, her half. And finally she understood that the concept of 'half' went much further than she imagined."Looks like you caught me, princess." She muttered seeing Aurora running with Oscar. The young woman looked toward her laughing jovially, making her heart leaps again. That feeling was very different from what she was used to. Addictive, sweet, warm. It was a little scary, but also heady.So that was love? Although she never felt that way about anyone, she was sure.She loved Aurora.  

The king was very depressed and nothing that the queen did or spoke improved his mood. She was also very sad and depressed. And how not to be? It was another birthday without her daughter. How long they would live without news?It was nearly eleven in the morning. After a long run, Aurora was panting and red-faced. Oscar came perched on her shoulder."Are you thirsty?""Too much. Can I drink the water of the lake?""Of course not! I can give you something better."She did appear on the ground a huge linen towel embroidered with drawings of dragons and large enough so both sit comfortably. Over the towel, several delicacies from other countries which Aurora had never heard. "Try this." She gave her a skewer with three round dumplings made of white mass and covered with a sauce which color was between brown and golden."It tastes good! What is it?""It comes from the Emma's birthplace. Locals call it dango and is made with rice flour."The fairy also tasted the delicacies, surprising the princess."Do you eat?""I do not need, but I like. Try this too." they ate, drank fruit juice and talked about trivialities.When was satisfied, Aurora lay down over the towel to watch the clouds."Look at that cloud! It looks like a rabbit!"She really tried, but only saw a shapeless cloud floating in the sky."That one looks like the Oscar, doesn't it? Look at that over there! I think it looks like a fish!""You have a fertile imagination. To me it is just clouds. What is the point?""None. It's just fun."The princess thoughtfully contemplated the sky and the older woman noticed a glint of sadness in her eyes. There was no need to ask to know she missed her parents. Was she was happy living in her castle? What would she do if were free to leave?Imagine that Aurora could go away made her heart ache, which was annoying. Since when a human was so important to her? Aurora was. And for being so important, her feelings cared a lot. So much so that Maleficent thought about let her see her parents as an extra birthday gift. It would only be for a few hours. What if Aurora didn't want to go back? But it was going to make her so happy! Damn, it shouldn't matter! Yes, it now mattered. Heavens, she was going crazy!"Do you miss your parents?" Maleficent asked impulsively, and cursed herself for having touched that subject.Aurora thought for a moment and replied."Yes, and I'm worried too. My parents may be suffering so much thinking I'm wretched. They don't know I'm fine and I have no way to tell them."When contemplating her face, Maleficent couldn't stand. Another self-curse to be getting so soft."Would you like to visit them?"She gave a start, hardly believing what had heard."Can I?""Of course! I can take you there without any problems.""But would you?"She had to gather strength to respond firmly."Yes, I allow you." With a wave of her hands, a ring with green stone appeared in the air. "Use this ring and never remove it for nothing. At midnight it will bring you back."Aurora couldn't believe it. Maleficent really intended to let her visit her parents! How was that possible? Almost a month ago she didn't even want allow her to go to the village!"I... I don't know how to thank you!""No need to thank. It does not cost me anything." She said pretending it didn't matter, but her heart ached just thinking about the possibility the princess never come back. Well, she couldn't show what was feeling. At least not yet. So Maleficent took her hand and put the ring on one finger. "Be very careful not to take this ring off, otherwise it will lose power and you can not be brought back.""I'll remember, don't worry."They stood and the fairy invited."We can take one more ride. After I will take you to the palace."Impulsively, Aurora gave her a big hug, leaving the woman paralyzed. Maleficent was with arms open and didn't know what to do once she had never been hugged by anyone in her life and her heart seemed about to cross the chest. A pleasant warmth spread quickly through her body, her legs went limp and she had to make a great effort to keep her self-control. "Sorry, I got carried away!""Thankfully no one saw it." She murmured trying to pretend her usual frown and they rode the dragon for another ride."Heavens, what's that?""It's a dragon! A huge dragon!""Run for your lives!"Everyone ran terrified by the huge beast flying over the palace. The King and Queen froze in fear when the guards warned about the big threat hanging over them.The dragon landed softly on the courtyard. The guards moved forward to attack and soon retreated when saw Maleficent riding the beast. And she wasn't alone! In the throne room, the royal couple was apprehensive with the threat. Was the dragon going to attack the palace? Maybe devour everyone after roast them well?"Your Majesty! You won't believe it!" Said a guard with wide eyes."What is happening?"When the guard was answering, a "ohhh" echoed throughout throne room when two people come in. The king looked hardly believing his eyes and the Queen began to sob when Maleficent approached the throne holding a scepter with one hand and leading Aurora with the other."Mom! Dad!""Daughter... but what..." he looked at the princess and Maleficent and didn't know what surprised him more, his daughter alive and apparently healthy or with Maleficent bringing her to the palace."You can spend a few hours together." Fairy said dryly to the couple. "Today, at midnight, she will return to my castle."Before she left, Aurora thanked once more."Thanks for everything. I'll see you tomorrow!"She just smiled and disappeared into thin air, reappearing on the saddle over dragon and went flying swiftly, hoping with all her might for that promise to be fulfilled.When the wicked fairy was gone, they ran up to her daughter for a big hug."My little daughter, do not believe you are alive!""Did she torture you?""Oh, heavens! I bet you are starving! You are so skinny!""I will order a banquet immediately!"They talked at the same time, not giving Aurora time to answer any of the questions."Mom, Dad, calm down! I'm fine! She allowed me to spend rest of the day with you because today it's my birthday."Her parents looked at each other, then looked at their daughter and the king asked."What has happened in that castle?""A lot of things! You won't believe it!"The banquet was served, an orchestra was called to play some music and they celebrated the return of the princess. Even the fairies were called and all cried with joy at seeing Aurora unharmed."You are so beautiful!" Said Flora touched. "But this dress, oh no! What a horror!""Strongly Agree!" Merryweather said. "Purple and black? Argh! Blue!""No way! Rose!""Do something with the two colors and everything will be fine."During the banquet, Aurora told all that had happened to her, but taking care to exclude unpleasant incidents with Maleficent and also her alcoholic crisis. They needed good news, no worries."I learned Greek and now I'm learning Latin! It is incredible!"They looked at her with wide eyes and the queen asked."So you speak Greek?""Actually, I can only read and write. Now I can read many books from her library.""And are you learning math?" her father also asked shocked."I know the basic operations and I'm also learning algebra and geometry!"She looked at both and realized that none of them seemed really happy."This is not appropriate for a princess! Which man will want to marry a woman who knows so many things?" The queen asked. Aurora tried to disguise the annoyance and explained."In Forbidden Lands, women are free to do what they want, but men don't run away from them. Everyone is happy!""What a horror! I bet that creature has hypnotized you!""What? Dad, of course not!"The other members of the court were also outraged. First to know the Maleficent's lands weren't the terrible and dark place that everyone imagined. Second, the liberality with which the inhabitants lived, totally ignoring the customs and traditions of the time. And the princess talked about those things as if it were wonderful!"My daughter, I do not know what curse this woman threw against you, but now you are back and we will find a way to end this." the king said.She felt something bad in the stomach."Don't you remember what she said? I'm leaving at midnight today." Both were very sad and upset."She let you come just to take you back again? This is so cruel!" the queen cried."I'll can come back sometimes to visit you.""But she is misrepresenting your mind!" The king said visibly upset. "A princess shouldn't...""Dad, I think everyone should live their life as they want!"Deathly silence. How she was able to say such heresy? Of course, people couldn't live their lives as they saw fit, especially women! Fauna tried to fix the bad mood that had settled, diverting it for other things. But no one was happy with the course of events.."Then the king Hubert died? Too bad..." she spoke very sad."Thanks to this evil creature that you insist on defending" the king said bitterly."No, Dad. He died of grief because Philip was unable to defeat her. Do you remember he even asked her to kill me, but spare his life? That was a horrible thing!""But now his kingdom is being threatened with a war!""I'm sorry about that, mother, but it isn't our responsibility to save them. If I had married Philip, this kingdom would a coward king."Everyone became restless and Prime Minister said venomously."It's what happens when women are free! Soon they start getting ideas, thinking and this can be very dangerous! Now no prince will want to marry her!"Aurora stood staring at the man and replied."If a prince isn't able to accept me as I am, then I don't want to marry him!" And went away leaving everyone shocked. The fairies were immediately behind her.After a few more strokes, she finished her work and was pleased with the result."Do you think it looks good?" she asked to Oscar, who agreed. "Me too." She placed the drawing on a wall, along with several others. Some were just sketches and drafts. Others were complete and detailed paintings. All drawings portrayed one person: Aurora. She was portrayed smiling, serious, sad, angry and with various other facial expressions. In some she was in full body, in others only from the waist up. Her last work was the princess lying on the linen towel contemplating the clouds."How is she now? Does she enjoying visiting her parents?" asked looking at the drawing.There were still about five hours to midnight, maybe a little more. Time passed so slowly that for her a few minutes seemed like hours. Every time her heart ached when imagined Aurora couldn't return. What if she didn't come back? What to do? Pick her up by force or leave her alone? Maleficent didn't want to do neither one thing nor the other. But she also didn't want to lose her. Not when she became aware of her feelings."If she does not come back, I do not know what to do, little one." Oscar shook his head. "Do you think she will come back? I would like to believe too, but I do not want have false hope. We must be realistic. They are her family. Why would she want to be with me?"A wave of dismay swept through her body. The chances of Aurora back willingly were small. She wouldn't be the least bit surprised if, at that time, the princess had already removed the ring.Aurora went to her former quarters angry and frustrated by the way she was received after months away from home. She was back and instead of celebrating, they only complained because she had learned many things? Did they would rather to see her thrown in the dungeon being tortured every day than learning Greek and Latin?"Aurora, do not be angry with your parents!" Flora said coming into the room with the others."How not to get angry with them? I'm fine, healthy, unscathed and instead of being happy, they get upset because think women must  be dumb and stupid?""Do not judge them so harshly. They have another mentality, very different from Maleficent. It is normal for people to be outraged." Merryweather also said."That's why you didn't let me studying anything, isn't it?"They bowed their heads and Flora said."People do not accept free women yet and we didn't want you to have problems.""Well... they'll have to get used to, because I won't lose everything I learned just to be the daughter they want. Maleficent never asked me to change."The fairy looked at each other for a moment and Flora took Aurora's hand."This ring will take you back. Just take it out and you can stay here."She pulled her hand back."What? No way! When it is midnight, I'll go back to Maleficent's castle!""Your parents will be hurt!""I gave my word!""Stay and the Royal Army will prevent her to capture you again!""We'll protect you!" Fauna assured and Merryweather supported."If she try to capture you, we will fight with all our strength!"The princess raised both hands and said."Please don't insist! I wanna go back!"The three were silent for a while."I'm happy there, don't you understand? With Maleficent, I can be myself!""With Maleficent, you'll be prisoner!" Flora argued trying to convince her."Here I'll also be a prisoner! My parents don't accept me as I am and I can't be myself! I'll have to fit in into rules with which I disagree and never do things I like. This is a worse prison!"(Flora) "Are you not afraid to hurt your parents?""Yes, I am. You don't know how it breaks my heart, but I must follow my heart and make my choices."(Merryweather) "You're the only daughter. The succession of the throne will be harmed!""Thanks to these stupid traditions, a woman can't reign. The only way is marry a prince and live the rest of my life under the shadow of another person. That's not the life I want. Sorry."They looked at each other again and Flora said."We will talk to your parents and explain everything. They will be hurt, but understand."(Fauna) "You are right, honey. You can choose your own way."(Merryweather) "Rules are idiots and I never liked them! If they do not accept as you are, then there is no reason to force yourself to stay here just to please them!"The fairies left the room, leaving Aurora gaped. She didn't expect they would support her. 

In Aurora's bedroom, Maleficent was sitting on the edge of the bed holding one of her pillows to feel her good smell. it was an hour to midnight, which was still too much for her. Time passed slowly and she had to fight against the urge to go to the palace and bring Aurora back. No, she couldn't do it because promised the spell was to last until midnight.Oscar didn't seem a bit worried. Was she not exaggerating? On second thought, it was so ridiculous suffer that way because of a human who wasn't even match her feelings. What a idiocy! She was Maleficent, known as the Mistress of All Evil, and should has more dignity!"She will not come back and I am suffering for nothing like an idiot!" She said quietly leaving the pillow aside. Why suffer for someone who certainly saw her as a monster or a pest?Who in right mind would give up living in a palace, have a normal life and even marry a prince to live as a prisoner having to put up with a weird fairy with bad temper and never get married and have a family? Aurora could be foolish, but no stupid.Maybe it was better forget her and Maleficent left the room decided to end that matter. The princess could live in that idiot palace, she didn't care. Her heart ached. Of course she cared, but there was nothing to be done. She could only learn to live with that pain.Thanks to the intervention of the fairies, Aurora's parents accepted the situation a little better. In the end, they were thankful for her to be healthy and fine. They couldn't understand why she wanted to come back to Maleficent's castle and believed it was just to prevent a fight that could cause many casualties. It was the only plausible explanation.Since they didn't want to lose that small chance to be with her, they tried to make the most talking, giving gifts and hearing more about her new life, which actually wasn't as bad as it looked. She was well fed, slept in a decent room instead of a cramped cell, wore beautiful dresses and even was receiving gifts!"It was she who gave you this necklace?" Her father asked impressed to see an emerald necklace around her neck."Yes. She always gives me many things. I can ask whatever I want.""Unbelievable!" both exclaimed at the same time impressed for Maleficent treated her so well.Fairies also brought some gifts to her. Among them, a very white feather like it was taken from the wing of an angel."With this magic feather you can send a letter to anyone from anywhere in the world. You just need to write the recipient's name on the envelope and the letter will be sent at the same time.""Wow, this is really good! So I can always write!"By far, the Prime Minister watched everything feeling a twinge of satisfaction. Of course he didn't like one bit to know there was a place where so much freedom was given to women, but there was nothing to do about it. But knowing that Aurora didn't intend to fulfill her royal obligations was encouraging. Without an heir to the throne, the royal lineage would end right there.it was only a few minutes to midnight when everyone goodbye Aurora tearfully."Please write us always!" her mother asked."And beware of Maleficent! Do not trust her no way!" her father advised and Aurora thought it best not to say anything. Over time they were going to understand.Fairies also said goodbye to her and when the clock struck midnight, her body slowly disappeared in the air."Goodbye! I'll always write and when possible, I'll be back!"She disappeared before several pairs of eyes full of tears and reappeared in her room, in the castle. The feeling was to be home, finally.At first she had decided to do it the next day, but it wasn't possible sleep with that doubt tormenting her the whole night. So Maleficent decided to end this torture once and for all. Of course she knew very well Aurora wasn't going to come back, but needed to see with her own eyes and close the matter definitively. At the door, she tried to get up the courage and confront the truth. What should she do after that?Her pride said to bring Aurora by force, because she was still her prisoner. But that same pride also said it was great humiliation to go after a person who was able to break a promise. Definitely, she didn't know what to do.The door opened slowly. The room was dark and didn't have anyone there. She pulled back the curtain and entered the bedroom, which was also dark. On her shoulder, Oscar seemed relaxed. Poor innocent creature! How would he feel when found out that Aurora is gone forever?The bed was empty and she put a hand on the chest in an attempt to contain a sharp pain that struck the heart. Her throat tightened strongly and she felt the urge to scream and destroy everything around until not be left one stone upon another. It was past midnight, then Aurora was supposed be back. She had to gather all her self-control to not shoot rays to all sides. That wouldn't bring her back."So that is it. She did not come back as promised." Fairy whispered feeling her heart breaking and her hopes of being happy with Aurora die. But when was leaving the bedroom, she heard the sound of the bathroom door opening. Her body trembled at seeing Aurora stretching and yawning. The feeling was like to see the sun rise and lighten a dark, cold and desolate world bringing life and warmth to every corner of her soul. All the pain in her heart was drained and replaced by the sweet warm feeling of hope that she could still have Aurora.Oscar flew her to give a warm welcome."Hi, my little baby! Did you miss me? I wanna kiss!" The dragon licked her lips with his tongue, something that Maleficent didn't like to see."Heavens, do not you have knowledge of hygiene?""Maleficent? What are you doing here in the dark?"Fairy gulped and replied with that usual wicked smile."So you came back? What a surprise! I thought your parents had arranged some unlucky prince to marry you!""Hahaha, I'm dying laughing! At this moment, I just wanna marry my bed!"Maleficent laughed, partly to vent a little. And also because was happy with the return of the princess."Go on. You get a horrible face when do not sleep well.""You love annoy me, isn't it?""It is almost as fun as burying an entire village with molten lava."The young woman settled under the blankets and Maleficent sat on the edge of the bed. There was something she needed to know anyway."I know you are dead tired, but answer me one question: why did you come back?"Lying down, she looked into Maleficent's face. As the bedroom was dark, she could see only green and yellow eyes standing out in the darkness."Because I wanted to go back.""Would you rather live here than with your parents?"Seeing the blonder hesitated to answer, she said."You can be honest. I am not a cry baby like you!""But you're annoying sometimes! I came back because I like to live here, that's it.""Here you are a prisoner.""In my father's palace too. There I can't do things I like, always have to follow rules and can't be myself. You are always annoying me, but at least don't fill me with stupid rules.""Well... They are your parents.""It may sound crazy, but it's easier to live with you than with them. They make me feel very suffocated!"She thought for a moment and asked again."If you could choose, would go away or stay here?""Why are you asking me these things? Do you want kick me out?""Of course not, you foolish!""Well... I choose to stay here, if possible...""I said I do not want to send you away. It is just curiosity, nothing more. Now sleep, you are so tired that can not even understand nothing.""Good night..." Aurora said gladly settling under the blankets. Oscar lay on her side and was soon asleep too.Before leaving the bedroom, Maleficent looked back once more and said softly."Good night, my princess." 

"It's getting cold!" Emma said wincing. "The winter will be rigorous this year.""Is very cold here at this time?""Really cold! And usually has snow storms too."They were returning from the village of carriage after doing some shopping. A few days ago, Maleficent decided allow her go to the village when wanted, but without go too far because could be dangerous. They had a very different talk that day. In fact, it was quite strange!It all started with a book she found on one of the shelves of the library. Why did she chose just that book? It looked like any other, had nothing differently. The book was written in a language she didn't know and the words looked like small squiggles, but she could see the pictures and her face turned red like a tomato."I don't believe they have this kind of thing here! What a indecency!" her first thought was to put the book back and get out of there as if nothing had happened, but curiosity was stronger and she ran to her quarters because didn't want anyone to see her looking those things.Although not so innocent about sex, because had seen many things when she went to the tavern, there were still many things that Aurora didn't know yet. Why there were so many different positions? Some of them looked like contortion shows! It was possible for a woman spreading her legs like that? How a man could stand all that weight over his body balancing on one leg? Why in some positions, the woman was upside down?And why the hell Maleficent had to appear in the most embarrassing moments? When she was looking at a very scandalous picture, the fairy suddenly appeared behind her and asked."What are you looking at, princess?""Nothing! Nothing!" She gasped with sweat running down a red face and hid the book behind her back."Stop nonsense, I have no age to such modesties. What has in this book that left you with this silly face?"She wiped the sweat, swallowed loudly, sat on the couch and said quietly."I found this book by chance and it has pictures of couples doing... things.""Doing 'things'? Ah, yes. Having sex, you mean."Her face was even redder."What scares you? Let me guess: the fairies have never talked about these matters, isn't it? Certainly you should not make the slightest idea how babies are made.""From a magic seed planted..."Maleficent gave a cynical laugh."No, you foolish! They are made when the couple have sex! There is nothing complicated about that!"She cringed and Maleficent lost patience."Do not play innocent, you know how this is done.""But I... wait! How do you know that?""I know everything. I know you used go to a tavern and also know what you did with those prostitutes. Why are you so ashamed of a book?"If could, she would have dug a big hole and hid inside. What a shame! Her hands gripped the cloth of dress nervously and she didn't know what to do."Why did you do those things?"It was necessary to calm down a bit, take courage and she answered."You know, everyone always wanted me to be perfect. I could never say what was thinking and never show any faults. It was very overwhelming for me!""I understand. It was a way for you deviate from the ideal of perfection which they pushed down your throat.""I wanted to be free, try new things without anyone censoring or telling me what to do!""It was a strange way to do it, but I do not judge. Did you really like to kiss those women?"The question, asked so directly, caught her by surprise. Well... since they were having this conversation and Maleficent didn't reproach her, Aurora felt safer to talk."Yes... I liked. Well, I wasn't in love with them, it was just...""You did it for pleasure.""It happens with other women?" she asked feeling a little more comfortable.Maleficent took the book, flipped through a few pages and showed her a picture where two naked women were kissing while fondled each other."Most humans are attracted to people of the opposite sex. But some are attracted to the same sex. Still have those who like both.""Am I like this?""Have you ever felt any kind of attraction to that idiot prince? I am talking about physical pleasure." She asked hoping the answer was no. "I never felt... physical pleasure... with him. I mean, I think I was fascinated, deluded, I don't know. But I never imagined myself doing with Philip what I saw couples doing in the tavern."Maleficent gave a slight sigh of relief."Do you think I'm attracted to women?""I believe so." That was very good, because Maleficent was a woman and things would be very difficult if Aurora was attracted to men only.After some thought, she wanted to know."Is wrong for a woman to like another?""Of course not! People make stupid rules because they do not know mind their own business. Two people of the same sex can love and stay together for a lifetime.""Nobody ever told me about it.""I see they did not talk about many things. Do not worry. With time, I will teach you."The princess didn't understand the double meaning of that words, making her smile. After all, she hadn't lost all innocence. Well... she intended to fix that soon."Do you miss to attend these taverns?""I don't think about it in a long time. Maybe it isn't necessary any more because here I don't have to be the perfect princess that everyone want. That's why I'd rather live here than in the palace."She had to make a small effort to have the courage to talk. After all, it was just to make that proposal Maleficent caused that whole situation, including placing the book in a place where Aurora would find. She needed first know the reasons why the princess did those things, but didn't know how to start this type of conversation without disrespecting her space. "Would you like to walk freely through the village?"Her eyes shone."Really? Can I?""Only if you promise me one thing.""What?"Maleficent stood up and walked to the balcony. After a little hesitation, Aurora went after her. The fairy looked at the landscape for a few seconds and then replied."I do not want you to do those things, nor with other women, or with anyone else.""Why?"Her hands closed tightly and she took a deep breath."Because I do not want. That is it. I am willing to give you anything, but in exchange you will never get involved with anyone, whether man or woman." That was very important for Maleficent. She was not willing to share Aurora's heart and body with anyone else in the world. The fairy intended to do the same because no one interested her but Aurora.It was a very strange proposal and Aurora couldn't understand why it was so important for the fairy. Well, anyway she was never interested in anyone since was living in the castle and didn't believe it could happen one day. It seemed a small price to pay to have more freedom."I... I accept."Maleficent held her arms tightly, causing the blonde to stay close to her, and looked deep into those eyes."I know you always do everything you promise, but this is the most important promise of all. This is why I do not want you to promise. I want you to swear."The grip got stronger and Aurora feel the heart leap. Their bodies were very close, almost touching and she felt a pleasant warmth in chest and  bubutterflies in stomach with the fairy proximity."Swear you will not get involved with anyone, whoever. Do this and you will have everything you want. Nothing will be denied."Despite the imperative tone of her voice, Aurora saw her eyes were pleading, something she had never seen before. That matter seemed to be very important for Maleficent and she understood that refusing the proposal wouldn't only deprive her of having more freedom, as to leave the fairy sad too. So she decided."I swear by all that's holy, by my parents, I won't get involved neither fall in love with anyone!"Maleficent made her swear twice more before being satisfied."Come on." She called, sitting on the couch. "This book is interesting and there are some things I want to show you."With trembling legs, Aurora followed her and sat on her side, noting that the fairy had sat closer than usual.Inside the carriage, watching the view through the window, Aurora remembered those moments feeling that strange butterflies in her stomach. Since then she have more freedom and could even visit her parents from time to time. She still didn't understand why it was so important to Maleficent, but for now it was all right for her. Walking through the village was very entertaining, she could see places, people and other different things.Over time, she saw that keeping the promise was going to be the easiest thing in the world.

The dirt water in the bucket reflected her tired face. That kind of work definitely wasn't for her, never! With this job, all her beauty was going to fade within a few years. Helga dipped the mop in the bucket to clean the floor barely containing her anger. Why her parents forced her to do that horrible service? She was so good in her old job!"You'll learn to earn a living honestly!" her mother said, and was supported by her father."You don't need to do it to make money!"After talking with some friends, they got for her a miserable job as a maid at Maleficent's castle. That job was good for ugly women, but not for her who could earn much more money, jewelry, dresses and various other gifts from her customers.That was why Helga was resentful. What a curse! The body belonged to her, so why she couldn't use as wanted? She was discreet, wasn't hurting anyone and was always careful to never accept married or engaged men. In Maleficent's lands was very difficult to find women who do this kind of work because they had other options, so the few ones who accepted such job earned a lot of money and some even became rich.She was beautiful, sensual, had a perfect face and body and knew exactly how to please any man at bed. Helga was a tall woman with long red hair and amber eyes that mesmerized men. Not to mention a wonderful pair of breasts that, by itself, worth many gold coins. But all her beauty was going to end with that miserable work. What a Hate!"Why does it take so long? This room needs to be cleaned today! Come on! Come on!" The milliner said primly with too high-pitched voice for a man."Yes sir."The sound of someone knocking on the door made him stop talk a bit, which was a relief."Come in, dear! I was waiting for you! Oh, don't notice the mess. This servants today is terrible! Your dress is almost ready, come in and try!"Helga looked up and saw princess Aurora, the young woman who Maleficent kept prisoner, but had more privileges than all members of the court together. She went behind a folding screen and left wearing a dress that made her eyes widen.The outfit had two overlapping black dresses. The top layer was partially closed by ribbons like a corset, had long sleeves with gold bands on the hems and was partially open. The inner dress had a heart-shaped neckline and the fabric was filled with golden patterns of dragons."Oh, my God! It's heavenly! Fabulous! Stunning!" He said with higher voice, fanning himself with a flowery fan."Do you think so? It wasn't exaggerated?""Not at all, dear! Her Excellency has 'excellent' (giggle) taste in clothes, I loved! It'll combine divinely with the jewelry she ordered! I love rubies! Hmm... just let me make some adjustments and it'll be perfect!"The maid continued her work, looking surreptitiously Aurora occasionally. Damn the princess's luck! Why she could have everything without any effort? Oh sure, she was the Maleficent's favorite.Why the fairy cared so much with a dull princess? Some rumors and gossips said Aurora was her lover. Although no one could prove anything, Helga didn't doubt that. The owner of that castle has never treated anyone so well. She was generous, always giving gifts and the princess could talk to her as an equal, which Maleficent would never accept from anyone. Helga sighed. She wouldn't care to lie with another woman in exchange for a life filled with luxury and comfort. And Maleficent wasn't ugly to look at.But no, the fairy preferred that boring princess. It was hard to believe she had received the gift of the beauty from a fairy. If she received, then should have lost it in some trash can because Helga didn't see anything extraordinary. Her hair was beautiful, of course, but the rest looked pretty ordinary. And How could she seduce someone with such small breasts? It was hard to believe that unmarried and rich men of the court dreamed of her.Upon finishing the work, she left the room after a last look at the princess who strutted with the beautiful dress which Maleficent had ordered for a party that was going to happen within four days. Life was so unfair!"Is the dress good?" Emma asked when Aurora come back to her room."A little bit exaggerated, but very beautiful!""You know Her Excellency only have great thoughts!""Yes..."While preparing the water for the bath, she noticed Aurora very thoughtful."What's up? I thought you liked the dress.""It's not the dress. This morning something happened...""She ran her hands on your buttocks again?"Her face turned red when remembering this episode."You are feeding better." She said giving a strong grip on her buttocks, "I feel more volume here!"She shook her head slightly to concentrate on the conversation."No, it was something else!""What? Another 'jealous' crisis? She showed you more one of those books? Did you sit on her lap?""Hey! She did it to give me the Latin lesson!"Emma smirked."Put her hand inside your cleavage was part of the lesson?""It was to catch an insect that had fallen there!""Ah, yes... The insect you haven't seen and have never been found. Well, what she did this time then?""A strange question. She wanted to know if I've thought about shaving the hairs of my... er... intimate parts.""What did you say?""I said yes, sometimes. Then she said to not do it because she likes natural. What did she mean by that?""Your bath is ready, enter the tub before the water gets cold!" Emma rushed to answer to not touch that subject with Aurora. It was none of her business."But...""Come on!"Even thwarted, Aurora took off the clothes and stepped into the tub. Emma left the bathroom so she could bathe in privacy. Her intuition told something was happening. On second thought... those Maleficen's attitudes weren't normal. Before, the physical contact between them was almost nonexistent. In recent weeks, however, it was becoming constant and sometimes excessive.Many things had happened beyond what she told Emma. Conversations that were always spicy, questions about her experiences in the past and if she had touched herself and how it was. Maleficent even asked if she had felt orgasms and if she liked it. Moreover, touches. Many touches. And all made her skin crawl a nice way and caused that butterflies in her stomach. Her heart beat faster and in no time she felt scared or uncomfortable. Maleficent always stroked her hair and face, held her hand and occasionally asked her to sit on her lap.Was that normal among friends or was there something else about the fairy's gestures? Aurora didn't know as this has never happened to her before. Such things didn't exist between her and Philip."Are you finished?" Emma asked outside."Yes!"The maid came when she was washing her face and Emma was ready to pour clean water over her body. Her face was covered with soap and she was with eyes closed. So she didn't see someone else had entered the bathroom. Emma opened her mouth and closed again when Maleficent motioned for her to stay quiet and leave the bathroom, in which was promptly obeyed. When finished scrubbing the face, Aurora emptied the bathtub and stood still with closed eyes, causing Maleficent lick her lips with pleasure to see that beautiful body covered in foam."You can pour the water, Emma."She smirked, grabbed the jug and poured water over Aurora's face. When could open the eyes, she almost slipped and fell back into the bathtub to see who was in the bathroom."Where's Emma?""She left." She replied pouring more clean water over her body. "Are you surprised? I finished my duties earlier today.""Oh... good..." it was just her imagination or the fairy was looking at her body in a strange way? No, it wasn't. Maleficent actually was looking her body intensely.Her skin was flushed because of the hot water and despite the heat, Maleficent realized her nipples were hardened. If princess's taste was as good as her smell, then she should be gorgeous. When finished, Maleficent grabbed a towel."It is time to dry yourself. It is cold and I do not want you to get sick." Aurora came out of the bathtub and Maleficent helped her, touching her body through the fabric of the towel. After, she gave her a little bottle containing almond oil. "Use this to keep your skin from drying out. "Seeing that the fairy wasn't going to leave, Aurora began to pass the oil on her body in silence, feeling pleasant shivers at how Maleficent watched her. After a while, she enjoyed to be looked at and wondered what the woman was thinking. Maleficent closely followed the movement of her hands roaming her face, neck, shoulders, arms, breasts (she wanted to do that so badly!), belly, buttocks and legs.Suddenly, Aurora had a very naughty idea and asked extending the bottle with oil."Can you rub oil on my back?" She shivered slightly with the way Maleficent smiled. It was a so perverse, so evil and at the same time fascinating and attractive smile."Of course!" She poured some oil on hands and passed slowly over her skin without any hurry. Aurora swallowed discreetly at fairy's touch, who had the skin hotter than an ordinary person. "Your skin is so soft!" A slightly hoarse voice spoke. "But it is a little tense on the shoulders. I will take care of it."With agile movements of the hands, Maleficent massaged her shoulders and neck, causing Aurora relax. She really knew what was doing!"Now you should dress, unfortunately." The last word was spoken very softly and Aurora didn't heard right."What did you say?""Just get dressed. I brought a picture book for us to look at together. I know you will like."When Aurora finished dressing, they sat on the couch to look a book filled with beautiful pictures which Maleficent had brought. There were drawings of birds, flowers, all kinds of animals, fish and also landscapes. Everything very well drawn and colored, so that some seemed real. At one point, Maleficent said."This way you can not see very well. Wait." She put an arm around Aurora's shoulder, pressed her body on hers and continued to turn the pages as if nothing had happened. Occasionally the woman looked at her and realized she was with red face, but showed no discomfort, which was good. That young woman needed to get used to her proximity, because they were going to get even more intimate soon.Gradually she was relaxing and soon was feeling comfortable with the Maleficent's proximity and her arm around her shoulders. For the first time she realized the fairy had a pleasant smell, composed of oriental notes of amber and maybe a bit of musk, patchouli and scepter. It was a seductive, exotic, warm and intense fragrance that she aspired with pleasure.

The castle was being decorated for the big party Maleficent was going to give in celebration for having avoided an invasion of Forbidden Lands. An idiot king with no sense of danger had decided to invade her domains and his army was massacred as if they were insects. The idiot came back with his tail between legs after kneeling before her and swear servitude and loyalty.It was a great victory because everyone were going to know how powerful she was and after that, no one would have more courage to face her.Ada, along with other cookers, was preparing a great feast with roasting meats of various kinds. Boars, pheasants, deer, fish, chickens and beef (which was very expensive). There were also fruits, breads, meat pies, different types of cheeses, many delicacies from other countries and the most appreciated desserts such as sugared almonds, sweets made with marzipan, fried pastries stuffed with jam and pies.To drink had fruit juices, mead,  blackberry gin and wines made with grapes, pomegranate, blackberries, pears and cider. Maleficent rarely gave parties because didn't like social events. But when she wanted, it was a great event and all the nobles and influential people of the region disputed the invitations.Helga worked hard helping to clean up, put out the trash and doing other coarse services. The other maids gossiped gladly how the party was going to be fantastic. Why those idiots were so happy? The party was only for the guests. They were there only to serve. Oh sure, they should be happy because the food scraps that could take home. Bunch of starving!She only thought about how many rich and unmarried men were going to attend the party. And also an equal number of rich women who had more chance with these men than she. Who would pay attention to a maid?"I saw the goldsmith visiting Her Excellency today!" She heard when walked near a group of maids who gossiped, as always, and listened."Did he bring the jewels?""Yes! A beautiful necklace and gold earrings, ruby and diamonds! He even made a tiara for her!""Ohhh!" the others exclaimed wondering how beautiful the princess was going to be, once Maleficent only gave the best to her.A bitter taste invaded her mouth to imagine that dull princess being the star of the party and attracting the attention of several suitors. It was pathetic to see how they were willing to risk their necks just to have a chance because everyone knew how Maleficent was jealous and possessive with Aurora.Life was so unfair! While the princess had everything, she, much better and more beautiful, had nothing! Several times she thought about quitting that crap of job and come back to her old job, but feared her parents. Her father threatened to beat her until she was disfigured. He said he didn't mind being arrested after that, but he wasn't going to accept his daughter living that kind of life. And her mother said if that happened, she was going to be kicked out from home forever. Then Helga decided to accept her fate until get something better.She could have married a man in a good financial position, but she wanted a man who would give her a life of luxury and wealth. So she was still alone, because rich men wanted rich women and men who wanted to marry her were not as rich as she wanted.And she kept complaining about her bad luck."Excellency, here's the chair you ordered." Carpenters spoke respectfully while holding a beautiful and comfortable chair made with carved wood and covered with red velvet."Good. Put it beside the throne."She ordered the chair for Aurora to prevent the princess from being out of her sight. She knew that many bastards wanted woo her, which was a very big daring considering she could reduce them to ashes in a few seconds.It was late when she saw everything was progressing well, so decided visit Aurora before retiring. There was something she wanted to give to the princess."Good night, Emma.""Good night. Sleep well because tomorrow the party will be amazing!"When leaving the room, the maid met Maleficent, bowed and walked away wondering what she was doing there at that hour. Well... it wasn't her business, but sometimes she was concerned with how the fairy approached the young woman. It was obvious she was trying to seduce her, but apparently Aurora didn't understand very well her intentions.After wearing a cotton nightdress, Aurora was going to take a book to read before bed when Maleficent entered the bedroom."Hi! The day was very busy, no?" She greeted gladly, because they hadn't seen each other all day."You have no idea! I had great difficulty with a snowstorm that almost came out of my control.""Everything went right?""Once this continent is not buried under thirty feet of snow, then yes, everything went right. Let it go, I got something for you. Take off this nightdress."Aurora blinked a few times, trying to process what had just heard."What?""You heard me. Get undressed. I have a much better thing for you."Even without understanding anything, she obeyed after some effort to get out of the shock. It was her impression or being naked in front of Maleficent was becoming recurring?Maleficent unpacked a package made with linen cloth and and showed a nightdress that made the blonde blush. That tiny thing was really a nightdress? The outfit was made with purple silk and black lace on the ends, both top and bottom and had only a thin straps to hold it on her body."Lift your arms. Good." she dressed Aurora and admired the result  very pleased. "It is much better, is not it?""It's beautiful! I've never seen a clothe like it. But it's so small!""That is perfect! I do not understand why people wear so large and heavy clothes to sleep. It is uncomfortable! I particularly prefer sleep using nothing, but a light clothing also works well."She swallowed noisily, with the brain locked where Maleficent confessed to sleep naked. The fairy hold her arms and stood her before mirror."Wow... it's so transparent!" She said with red face."It shows everything but hides the essential. What do you think? You can speak the truth.""It's so beautiful... and lightweight too! Looks like I'm not wearing anything!""Good you liked. You needn't to have shame or embarrassment before me." She said still holding her arms. Both looked into each other's eyes through the mirror's reflection. "From now on, I want you to always sleep so.""Every night?" she gasped."Yes, every night. I will bring other nightdresses like this. You have such a beautiful body!" A hoarse voice said near her ear, making her skin crawl. "I know you can not show yourself during the day, but you can do this at night. Just for me, of course."Maleficent started caressing her arms softly with warm and very soft hands. Her nipples were hardened, the legs were trembling and Aurora felt a wetness forming between legs. Heavens! It was really happening? And with Maleficent?Maleficent realized the effect she was causing on the princess and it affected her too. So much so that she lost control of herself and hugged aurora from behind, caressing her belly sensually. It was a heady and wonderful feeling she had never felt with anyone!Suddenly, when she felt fairy's hands caressing her belly over the silk fabric and her body pressed to hers, Aurora realized what was happening. Mixed feelings invaded her. Fear and excitement, doubt and desire. Such situation scared a little, but when she felt hot and moist lips kissing her ear, all the doubts, fears and uncertainties evaporated like smoke and her eyes closed automatically.Maleficent's hot breath involving her skin, causing a delicious warmth spread through her body. She could hear the breath and the sound of lips kissing and nibbling her ear and soon after her neck. Maleficent's hands caressed her belly and one of them was going too low in a certain direction.Seeing that Aurora was enjoying, Maleficent had no more doubts than done. And she would have done if it wasn't an insistent knock on the room door. Who in right mind would dare to interrupt her just then? Surely someone who wanted to be killed."How dare you interrupt me now?" She roared opening the door and ready to shoot lightning bolts on the buttocks of those idiots.The guards trembled in fear and one of them said almost dirtying his pants."A thousand pardons, your Excellence, but we have a very serious problem. Some dragons are attacking the village!"Yes, that was a great emergency that couldn't be ignored. She returned to the bedroom and said showing visible annoyance and discontent."I have to go. Some dragons are causing problems.""How bad is it?" Aurora asked worriedly."Do not worry. They will not attack the castle. Sleep and rest. Tomorrow will be a busy day."The fairy came away wanting, for the first time, kill some dragons. Why did they decide to attack just when she was about to have Aurora? Well, no use complaining. The solution was to conform. She had a chance, so could have others in the future.After Maleficent left, Aurora sat on the bed still panting, red-faced and thinking about everything had happened. Maleficent was really doing those things? Was stroking her body? Kissing her ear and neck? What else she intended do next?She lay on the bed and covered herself with blankets still feeling the skin tingling. What a pleasant! The wetness between her legs was still there and without thinking about what was doing, she put a finger making her sex throb. The finger moved slightly, increasing that pleasant sensation and she soon climaxed thinking in Maleficent and the things she would have done if they hadn't been interrupted. Are they going to have another chance? 

After cleaning a few rooms, Helga came to the accountant's one, which she always left last."Can I come in, sir?" she asked seductively. The man grinned."Of course! You're always welcome in my room!""What have you been doing lately? You have traveled a lot!""Business, honey, business!" He replied squeezing one of her breasts with lust. "Um, I'm very bored. My job is so exhausting!""Do you want have some fun? I am always yours to command!"His smile got even wider and Helga had to make great efforts to satisfy that repulsive man. When finished, to her relief, she earned a little bag full of gold coins. That job was really good! In less than an hour, she got the salary of a full month!"Keep being nice to me and I promise you'll profit greatly!""Really?" She asked thinking he was talking about marriage. Well... that wasn't the husband of her dreams, but had so much money and it was the most important."For now I can't reveal anything, but I have big plans that will make me filthy rich!""Wow, you're really smart!" She praised several times, extolling the qualities he didn't have. Georgei accepted the praise happily. When become rich, he intended to be surrounded with beautiful women, all willing to meet his wishes.Helga came out pleased to have won some money. Occasionally she offered her services to the lonely men of the court. Only single ones to avoid any problems. It was very easy and her parents didn't suspect anything. She just needed to be discreet.After she left, he read again the letter which king Aragon had sent warning he intended to travel to the forbidden lands soon because he wanted to be present when Maleficent was defeated. That it was worrisome. If she realized the presence of the king, both would be dead men."Hope this asshole be discreet. I had a lot of work to fail right now!"The potion was being prepared and the process was very slow, but he was happy because was within the stipulated time. Before the winter solstice, Maleficent was going to be defeated and he to become the new owner of the castle and the Forbidden Lands."And that's what happened." Aurora finished telling to Emma all that had happened between her and Maleficent the night before. The maid heard in silence, whatching the princess' reactions. At least she didn't seem uncomfortable, scared or repulsed."Did you like it?"Aurora's face was flushed and she smiled shyly"I... I liked a lot. It was a shame she had to go...""Well, she wasn't gone forever, right? You'll still have other chances."Her body trembled a little and Emma asked."Do you really want to have another chance with her? You look scared.""Why is she doing these things to me?""Because she likes you!""Which way? I still don't understand..."The oriental young woman sat beside her and talked with serious voice. It was time for Aurora understand what was happening."I don't know what goes on in her head or what she feels, but everything leads me to believe she's in love with you."Her heart jumped inside the chest and she couldn't believe what had heard."Are you serious? It can't be!""Why? Do you think she can't?"Aurora thought Maleficent couldn't feel something for anyone, specially love! "Are you sure she's in love with me?""Sure I don't have, but it's what it seems like.""Maybe she just wants... you know...""Sex? Well, I think she wants it too, but not only it. Otherwise, she wouldn't have waited so long. You know, patience isn't her best quality.""No, it's not..."It was hard to believe that someone like Maleficent could love her. And if it were true? What to do? Most importantly, how did she feel about the fairy?"Be calm and let things moving naturally." Emma said to see Aurora confused. "Whatever will be, will be.""Listen, by any chance you know if she... I mean... with another person... uh..."She shook her head."If happened, I never heard. She never treated anyone like you. It must mean something, right?"She felt a little calmer. Her heart was beating happily and she liked the warm feeling in her chest. She never felt that way about Philip.Philip was exhausted but relieved. No one knew how or why, but King Aragon didn't threaten his kingdom with war. So for now he could enjoy a few moments of peace. His search for an opponent against Maleficent pointed to an island near Greece, and he carefully planned this trip.According to legends, this island had a wizard who could face Maleficent. Maybe with a good offer, he could help him. The resources of his kingdom were scarce, but if could marry Aurora, he'd have much gold at his disposal. Before, it was necessary take Maleficent out of his way.In her private room, Maleficent had finished getting ready for the party and watched the image on the big mirror, where she could see herself whole body. She couldn't stop thinking about what had happened between her and Aurora last night. It was a very bold step, but apparently worked. By then, the princess must have realized her intentions. What was she thinking about it?Her reactions when was caressed showed she had good chances. In no time Aurora showed fear or disgust, quite the opposite, and think so gave her more courage to take the next step. She wanted to take that step before the end of the night.Those dragons had taken a lot her time. It took almost the whole night until she discovered the beasts were attacking because some idiots had stolen their eggs. The dragon eggshells had many therapeutic properties, were highly sought and may cost its weight in gold. But the law allowed these eggshells were collected only after the dragons abandon nests not to cause any damage to the little dragons.But some greedy people didn't like to wait and often stole the shells shortly after the pup is born, or stole the eggs and it caused many disorders. Luckily, she managed to find the eggs and it was enough for the dragons had gone away. The culprits were severely punished and had their property confiscated to pay damages. During the rest of the day she had to fulfill some commitments in distant lands and to rest a little before the party. Spending many hours without seeing the princess always made her annoyed.

The milliner, along with Emma, helped Aurora to dress and put the jewels. "Fabulous! You're fabulous!" He said clapping, happy with his latest creation.Aurora's hair was neatly braided and was arrested for golden hairpins and also a beautiful tiara of rubies."You're ready and beautiful!" Said Emma. "I'm sure she'll love!"Her face flushed at the same time. How would be meet Maleficent after that incident? As if in answer, Maleficent entered the room, making her heart beat wildly. Emma and milliner bowed and left immediately, leaving them alone.When she looked into the fairy's eyes, she felt something sweet and warm in her chest that could only be love. It went far beyond what she felt for Philip. Yes, she also loved Maleficent. It didn't matter if she was a woman. Maleficent was the best person Aurora had ever known, and loving her seemed like the right thing.Maleficent came close, looking her up and down showing satisfaction. See the way the Princess looked at her made pleasing warmth flooded her chest. Yes, she was almost ready for her."The result was very good." She said in a low voice and Aurora noticed a seductive tone. "I think this is my favorite part!"A finger was placed into her cleavage, making the girl gasp with even more flushed face."Mine too."Fairy's smile increased and Aurora saw a different glint in her eyes. It was a mixture of lust, anxiety and also... love! So it was true. Maleficent loved her! "Do you like?" the finger went deeper, stroking the side of one breast. What a strange way to start a relationship! Sure, she was Maleficent and always did everything her way."Yes."For a moment, she thought seriously about sending everything to hell, rip those clothes and possess Aurora right there. Heavens! What was that furious desire which was dominating her body? It was something hard to control and she felt her sanity dripping like sand between fingers. Fortunately, Oscar landed over her shoulder bringing her back to reality. It wasn't enough to cool her desire, but gave a little more sense."I believe a party is waiting us, right?" She said trying to compose herself."I... think so.""Shall we?" The woman reached out and they were heading to the throne room. But both knew it was far from over.When the two women entered the hall, all the guests bowed as they walked arm in arm toward the throne. Maleficent led Aurora with one hand so she sat in the chair beside the throne and then sat too. The party started after a short speech about the victory over the invading army."So many people!" Aurora said impressed with the amount of guests."They are allies and work for me making sure everything is in order. A good leader must be able to lead and also to delegate tasks."In the middle of the hall, some couples danced to the music while others ate, drank and chatted happily. The servants came and went carrying trays of food and drinks for everyone."Accepts wine, sir?" Helga said sweetly extending a tray with excellent wine for GeorgeI who gladly accepted."Delicious!""Are you enjoying the party?""Not bad, she knows how to give a good party. But I intend also give many other when become owner of it all!""Then you'll be much better than her!""Surely, my dear! And I promise not to forget you."She smiled broadly went to serve the other guests. When saw Aurora sitting next to Maleficent, she felt a great anger growing within her soul. It was obvious that sly bitch had become more than mere Maleficent's lover, otherwise she wouldn't be getting that so differentiated treatment. The fairy had never allowed anyone to sit beside her throne. Not even at her feet."Enjoy while you can, princess of shit!" She thought. If Georgei's plan worked, within no time the princess was going to lose all the perks. Then she imagined herself taking her place as wife of the owner of that castle. And her first step was going to turn the princess into something worse than a servant, making her to clean latrines, collect manure in the stables and several other appalling service. Ah, sweet victory!Seeing the guests dancing, Aurora had a crazy idea."Do you dance?" She asked."Dance? I? Are you serious?""Why not? It's so fun! Have you ever danced?""Can you imagine me dancing?" The woman asked raising an eyebrow."If I couldn't, wouldn't have asked. Can you?""This is stupid. Forget it!""Ah, I see... you can't dance, isn't it?" She said teasingly hoping to reach Maleficent's ego. The fairy didn't accept someone saying she wasn't able to do something. It worked."Just because I do not want to dance, does not mean I am not able. I just do not want to!""What a pity... but I want to! I love to dance!"She pressed her lips to conceal the discontent because she didn't like to imagine Aurora dancing with those bastards who were an eye on her. But she knew the princess didn't intend to just sit there for the entire party. What to do? Dance with her or let her dance with those morons? The young woman looked at her pouting and with puppy eyes. Well, dancing couldn't do any harm. "Just one dance!" She said standing up and taking Aurora's hand. People opened passage as they walked and Maleficent did everything to show calm and tranquility despite feeling uncomfortable because had never danced with anyone. Well, it couldn't be so hard. The steps were simple and she had memorized after looking people dancing so many times. She just needed to keep pace with the music.The music started playing again and she led Aurora firmly and securely, showing that could dance very well despite having never tried before. Everyone stared them with fallen jaws and somehow Maleficent felt pleasure in shocking the guests. Aurora looked at her with flushed face and bright eyes, showing she was really enjoying her company. And on second thought, it was nice to have the princess in her arms. It was practically a hug.Gradually, Maleficent was getting used and when the song ended, she decided to dance another. Dancing wasn't so bad when she had such a nice dance partner. After a few songs, they came to sit because Aurora was footsore."Do you still think I ca not dance?" she asked with her typical arrogance."Surely you know. I loved it!"Although hadn't said nothing, Maleficent also enjoyed dance with Aurora because of physical contact. It was a good way to have the princess in her arms and make sure she wasn't going to dance with anyone else.The party went wonderfully well. In addition to music, food and drink, Maleficent had also provided entertainment with jugglers, fire eaters, exotic dancers and a group of oriental singers.Everyone applauded thrilled and Aurora had fun like she hadn't done in a long time. Her father's parties weren't as fun as Maleficent's. The food wasn't so different and extravagant, the orchestra was simple and the only entertainment was a drunk lutist who could barely play something decent.The more time passed, the more Helga felt angry to see how princess was treated by Maleficent. That little bitch was getting the best of the party while she was forced to serve the guests and hear some jokes from drunks who wanted nothing serious. Even Emma could enjoy the party as the other guests! How absurd! Oh sure, she was the favorite princess's maid.Her attention turned again to Georgei, her only hope of getting out of that horrible life. She had no idea which plan he had in mind, but cost nothing to flatter him a bit without getting involved. If he won, she'd be on the winning side. Otherwise, things remained as they were."What's up, Oscar? Don't you want more?" Aurora tried to offer a piece of fruit to the little dragon, who seemed unwilling to eat."I think he had enough of fruits." Maleficent said turning to her and leaving sycophants talking to themselves. Those creatures didn't stop talking!"But he still seems hungry, poor thing.""There are dehydrated insects in my laboratory. Go get some for him.""I won't be long."Aurora ran with Oscar to Maleficent's laboratory. Instead of a door, the laboratory had only a wall with intricate inscriptions that nobody understood. Maleficent had taught her the secret to enter, warning only she couldn't touch her experiments or open jars of ingredients."Insects... insects... look over there! Now you're happy, right? Let's take a few to the hall." She took a small bowl, poured some dehydrated larvae, butterflies and moths enough that Oscar wouldn't be hungry and came back to the throne room.When she finally got rid of sycophants, Maleficent looked around distractedly and a couple caught her eye. Not by man but by the woman who was with him. Her vision was exceptional and she was able to see better than an eagle, but the couple moved very quickly and there were other people partially covering her vision. But she could see a blonde woman in a black dress and braided hair along with the man and her blood boiled. What Aurora was doing with that bastard? They left the room and without thinking twice, she followed them. The couple seemed to run as if in a hurry and she saw they had gone into the garden, which made her blood boil even more. That idiot was a dead man. Definitely a dead man!

Upon arriving in the throne room, Aurora saw Maleficent's seat was empty."Where'd she go?" The fairy wasn't nearby and after ask to a maid, the blonde found out she was gone. Where? To the laboratory? No, otherwise they'd have found along the way. Not wanting to wait there alone, Aurora asked. "My little baby, you can find her, can't you?"Oscar flew with Aurora behind him and both went to the garden, which made her heart beat faster. What Maleficent was doing in the gardens? Was she waiting for her?The fairy walked slowly and her sensitive ears heard the sound of sighs and groans. She clenched her fists in anger and still didn't know what to do with that bastard: crush, burn alive or through his body with pointed stakes. They were behind a large bush and she saw them embraced exchanging kisses. His pants were down, the woman's dress was up and he moved the hips back and forth frantically, indicating he was close to climax."What is going on here?" A very angry voice said, almost killing both of fright. He pulled away immediately trying to cover his intimate parts and Maleficent realized she had acted like an idiot to see the woman's face. She wasn't Aurora.She was just a blond woman wearing a dark green dress. How could she have thought that ugly woman was Aurora? To disguise the shame, she snapped while some rays flashed around her hands."I do not admit such things in my garden! Get out now!"The woman just had to lower her skirt and run*, but the man didn't know whether he ran or stood up the pants and went away jumping and stumbling. Maleficent stood there breathing deeply several times and ashamed of herself for having committed a so stupid error. Right, her jealousy was getting excessive to the point of confusing another woman with Aurora! Fortunately no one witnessed her stupidity."Huh? What was that?" Aurora asked to see a couple running fast. The strangest thing was seeing the man adjusting his pants and scared as if had seen the devil himself. Therefore she concluded that Maleficent should be in the direction from whence they came. And she was right, although many questions have arisen in her head. "Maleficent? What're you doing here?"Seeing her, the fairy turned to face the other side because couldn't look at her after that fiasco."I am just breathing fresh air. Those stupid sycophants were making me nervous.""That terrified couple...""Only two morons I found by chance and were doing inappropriate things in my garden"Her face flushed and she giggled, imagining the scene of them being caught by the owner of the castle."Why are you laughing?""I'm imagining their faces when you caught them in the act. It must have been so funny!""There is nothing funny about it!" She said moody because still thought on the possibility of have been Aurora instead that of woman. There was no way to find this funny. "Let us go." She wanted to get out quickly and forget that shame.That annoyance made Aurora suspicious. It was hard to believe that such incident could let the woman so upset that way."What happened, really?" she asked, making Maleficent stop, her back still to her."Nothing you need to know.""Oh, please! I don't believe that couple let you so upset! Something happened and I want to know.""I do not owe you any explanation!" She shot rudely and and was leaving, but stopped again. No, it wasn't right. She was ruining the night because of a nonsense? That incident could distance them and she didn't want that at all.Thinking about it, she calmed down and turned slowly to Aurora, who was still standing in the same place staring at her."What happened?" Asked softly, coming closer."That couple... I... I thought the woman..." she looked away, swallowed and continued, "I thought the woman were you."Aurora didn't know what to think. So that was it? Another jealous fit? What was Maleficent's problem? She had taken an oath not to engage with anyone else! Why didn't she trust her? For a moment she was angry, but then realized it wasn't time to argue, but clarify what was happening between them."Did you mistake that woman for me? What a horror! I don't have that big nose!" She said undoing the awkward tension between them."I did not see much difference. She had your silly face.""Hey!"Maleficent just laughed, happy to Aurora wasn't upset. Well... they were alone in a peaceful garden lit only by the light of a few torches scattered here and there. The best part of the party was over, so there was no need for them to come back to the throne room."Do you want to sit down?" She invited, and they went to the bank below the two trees, that with the arrival of winter had lost almost all leaves. Still it was a good place to stay. They were silent for a while and upon seeing the princess shivered slightly with the cold, she put an arm around her shoulder. "Come closer. It is cold."Aurora snuggled pleasurably together the fairy, resting her head on one shoulder and breathing in her good smell. The large cape wrapped around her like a warm and cozy blanket."Is it better?" she asked softly."Much better!" The young woman replied holding her hand in hers. "Your hands are so warm!"Her body trembled slightly and Maleficent held her tighter against her body. What a sweet sensation she felt in her chest! What a wonderful warmth! It was something that took care of her body quickly and made her feel complete and… happy! Happy to have Aurora in her arms and know she was being matched. She was her half and they were destined to be together. So it was all right for the first time in many milenia.The blonde's face was very close and she didn't want to wait. She shifted, leaning to the side and looked at her face. Her eyes were closed and her expression was calm. Those red lips like a rose made her mouth water.The princess rested peacefully in Maleficent's arms when heard a voice calling her softly."Aurora..." her heart almost missed a beat upon hearing Maleficent saying her name for the first time. She lifted her head and looked into her eyes. When the princess looked into her eyes, Maleficent saw within them what she always wanted to see. She saw love and it was just what she needed. Without wanting to wait any longer, she glued her lips to the Princess' in a searing kiss that made her heart beat wildly and her body in flames. It was a wonderful, intense and addictive feeling that she couldn't avoid. And she didn't want avoid it. Her arms tightened Aurora as strongest as possible and she deepened the kiss, exploring that wonderful mouth with the tongue.As soon as fairy's lips touched hers, Aurora felt a warmth spread to the rest of the body and accumulate, along with increased moisture, between her legs. Fairy's hands stroked the entire length of her back and soon one was sliding on her leg and went up to caress one breast, squeezing it gently as Maleficent moaned against her lips.When the young woman needed air, Maleficent left her lips and rained wet kisses on her face and neck, nibbling the skin and tasting her with the tongue. Delicious! That was the only word with which she could define the princess at that time. Extremely delicious! The smell, taste and heat coming from that almost virginal body inebriated her such a way that she couldn't think of anything else. There was only one thing to do.Gradually, Aurora felt her body being tilted back and offered no resistance. That's when she felt something soft under her and she opened her eyes to see they were no longer sitting on the bench but on a very large and soft bed."Where are…""My bed!"The clothing that covered her body disappeared, as if had vanished into thin air leaving her totally naked before Maleficent, who looked her body with lust and want."You do not know howl I hoped for it, Aurora! And now you are mine. All mine. Forever! Do not Worry. I promise you will like it." She said hoarsely in desire and young woman could not say anything. Her lips didn't obey. She just closed eyes and give a slight smile, as if inviting the fairy to continue.Anyway, she didn't need an invitation, but of course Maleficent loved know that Aurora wanted it as much as she wanted, although didn't know what to do. But she knew. Yes, she knew very well what to do and how to do!When a naked body lay on hers, Aurora opened her eyes quickly, panting like if had lost the breath with such excitement and surprise. Maleficent looked at her eyes, smirking with her little scare."You are..." she said with difficulty stroking fairy's face."Yes?""So beautiful!"Her eyes told the truth. Usually she didn't like the praise of sycophants because they always pretended, inventing qualities she didn't have. But Aurora was different. Her compliments were always sincere and true.Aurora admired the fairy's face, that was a little sharp, angular and made her look powerful. Her hair was very black, long, straight and fell at sides of her face like a black curtain. She had pointed ears and those lovely horns that were no longer wrapped in leather straps. The princess held and caressed them, making Maleficent smile with satisfaction. But she didn't have much time to contemplate her because a red mouth glued to hers again in a long kiss that made her moan and sigh of pleasure as their bodies rubbed against each other.That night, the room was taken with the sound of sighs, moans and cries mingled with obscene words and some slaps Maleficent gave in Aurora's buttocks with great pleasure. Many kisses, licks, bites and scratches while exploring one another's body and its sensitive points. She took the young woman with fury, ardor and despair, loving her again and again and still wasn't enough to satiate her desire. It was almost two in the morning when they finally slept totally exhausted and happy, one another's arms.Inside his room, a small cauldron was steaming and he just waited the right moment to put the last ingredient. For the potion worked, it was necessary a part of her body. Could be a hair, fingernail, a drop of blood or even a little saliva. Georgei got some cups used by Maleficent during the party with Helga's help because there was saliva on them. He washed the cups carefully and the resulting water has become the most important ingredient of his potion."It's time. Perfect!" The potion was complete, just needed to cook very slowly for twenty-one full days. Occasionally, he mixed it with a silver spoon. It was a complicated process that needed to be monitored constantly so that nothing went wrong.Everything was ready for his plan to work. King Aragon had already reached the forbidden lands and was staying at an inn just waiting for the right moment to attack. Very astute, he took a few soldiers, all disguised to avoid suspicion. When it was time, he intended let them enter the castle for the king to cut off Maleficent's head as agreed.This, of course, only after he spit in her face and maybe give some slaps. She was going to pay dearly for the years of humiliation he had suffered. 

"Ouch! Be Careful!""Sorry. Wow, she has strong teeth!" Emma said impressed with the amount of bites on Aurora's back. "Why don't you ask her to stop?""Because is so good and almost doesn't hurts. Only after!""So you like, isn't it?"Aurora flushed and said nothing. Emma continued rubbing the ointment to heal the bite marks that Maleficent left in her body. The ointment was very efficient and healed those marks at least three or four hours. Fortunately the fairy didn't do it every night. A few days have passed since that night and Aurora still remembered when woke up the next morning with Maleficent's body virtually over her. Who could imagine that the fairy had such a heavy sleeper? When she tried to get out of bed to start the day, Maleficent showed that she had other plans."It is not time to wake up..." she said sleepy and tightening her in arms. Aurora thought about going back to sleep, but the fairy totally woke up and started to kiss and fondle her, not letting her out of bed while she wasn't satisfied. What a desire that she had!Ever since Aurora was sleeping in Maleficent's chamber, keeping her room to rest during the day and store her belongings. Despite being an exceptional and generous lover, Maleficent generally showed affection only with sex and gifts. They always appeared together in public and Maleficent made sure to let everyone knew Aurora was her mate. But still the fairy didn't show affection in public and sometimes scolded Aurora when she was caring at the wrong time.The princess was resentful at times, but Emma explained that this was the Maleficent's way of being. It made no sense to expect her to be romantic and loving, it wasn't her nature."Why don't you want to marry me?""Have you the nerve to ask? How pathetic!" Helga said with disdain for the poor man before her. Despite being very beautiful, well dressed and have a reasonable financial situation, he was far from wealthy husband she always dreamed of.It was pointless Baltazar try to argue with her. The proud woman went away with the nose up, leaving him talking alone. Why that idiot didn't give up once and for all? Marry him meant living a mediocre life as a housewife and having to do housework. Or worse, get a job to help with household expenses. She wanted a life of luxury, wealth, to worry only about take care of her beauty, wear beautiful dresses and valuable jewelry. If Balthazar couldn't give it to her, then he was useless. Angry with such insistence, Helga returned to her boring and miserable service always cursing bad luck."Did Baltazar propose you again?" One of the maids asked when she walked into the kitchen looking for something to eat."Yes, but he doesn't interest me." She replied dryly. Why that ugly woman want to intrude on her life?"But he's so handsome!" another maid said sighing."If you want, you can have him. I'm not interested. "The other maids grimaced. Helga was a very unpleasant person and no one could make friends with her, who always acted as she was better than everyone. After a while, the coworkers given up talking to her and returned to their duties, leaving her angry. Now they were ignoring her? Bunch of envious!"Hi, girls!" Aurora said coming into the kitchen with Emma and they responded cheerfully, but Helga remained quiet. Why the Princess insisted on attending kitchen and mingle with the servants? The other women were talking to Aurora, laughed and told funny stories while working. The mood was cheerful and relaxed.Everyone liked Aurora exactly because she was so friendly and kind, unlike the ladies of the court that always are snobbish, rude and treated maids like slaves. But of course, Helga didn't see that way."And then he asked me to marry him. What do I do?" one maid asked and Aurora said."Do you love him?""Since childhood!""So what's the matter?""He lives on the other side of the village and owns a shoe store. It is far from the castle, so I'd have to leave the job."Aurora knew the local women liked to be independent and rarely left their jobs to take care of home and children. For a time, she thought it very strange, but then understood and went on to agree with this thought."Can't you work in his shop? There must be something you can do. Or you can take advantage of the space and sell something of yours, but doesn't compete with the shoes."Mary thought for a while about what Aurora had spoken. Sell something from her? The idea seemed good."What could I sell?""Study the stores that have around and see what they sell. Then you'll sell what can't be found in other stores.""What a good idea!" the others exclaimed at the same time and Marry was very excited. She had many talents, so some of them should serve to provide her needs without relying on the husband.Helga, who until then was silent, wanted to know."Isn't he able to support you both alone?""Of course he is! His shop sells many shoes.""So why do you bother to keep working?""Because I never liked relying on anyone. It is very depressing to ask my husband for money as if I were a beggar! "The others maids agreed. In fact, some of them suffered in childhood with abusive fathers and saw their mothers suffering without being able to leave because they depended on their husband's money. Nobody wanted that kind of life."If she likes to work and be independent, then there's nothing wrong with that. People have the right to be happy the way they think is best, as long as they don't hurt anyone." Aurora said.The redhead gave a cynical smile and replied."You're right, your highness." The word "highness" was uttered sarcastically "After all, each one uses their talents to make a living, isn't it? Some use the brain, others use the body..."The kitchen was silent and several disapproving stares turned against Helga. Nobody liked that way of speaking and Ada decided to put that sassy in her place."Considering your past, I don't know if you have the right to say something."She shrugged."At least I admit what I did." Aurora was outraged. "I don't sell my body for money!""Really, dear? You lie with Maleficent every night and in return she gives you dresses, jewelry and many other things. What's the difference? ""First: I never asked her to give me anything. Second: There is feelings among us."The maid just laughing, leaving the princess angry."Feelings? Serious? Do you really think she loves you? Oh, how romantic! The dreamy princess thinks she has found the true love! Honey, she's just using you! When finished, she'll throw you away like an old rag! ""She's not using me!""Believe what you want. At least you're getting something. ""Well... at least she thinks I'm worth all jewelry and expensive gifts that gives me. And you? Do you think would have any chance with her?"The situation was spinning out of control. Helga wasn't afraid of Aurora. That skinny little princess didn't scare her."There are many rich men at my feet!""If that were true, you wouldn't be cleaning up other people's dirt for a living. By the way, I've had a chance with a prince. Have you ever come close to it at least once?"Her hands closed tightly. That princess was deserving of a punch!"I doubt any man this court wants to marry you and have a family! To them, you're just a toy to be used and thrown away!"Her self-control is totally gone after the last sentence and Helga rushed against Aurora. The maids prepared to detain her, but she was faster. But when she tried to strike a blow, her hand was held in the air and with a quick motion, Aurora threw her down twisting one of her arms."I've fought with men twice your size! A weak bitch like you is like nothing to me!"Aurora let her go under applause and laughter from the other maids. Helga tried to react and Emma stood between them."If you try to lay a finger on her again, I'll tell everything to Maleficent and you'll be thrown into the dungeon!" The woman even still to say something and Emma cut. "Shut up and get out! Otherwise, I'll punch you!"With no other alternative, she went away cursing. Right. This time, Aurora had achieved an enemy and she swore to herself destroy the Princess once and for all. No one treated her like that!After that incident, Aurora returned to her quarters and Emma went after her."Are you fine? You got quiet suddenly.""Do you think Helga is right?""What?""It's what everyone thinks? I'm... whoring… with Maleficent to win gifts?"Emma shook her head and replied with conviction."No matter what others think. You know that's not true. Maleficent loves you.""Do you really think so?""Of course! Otherwise, she'd be keeping you as secret. But she let everyone know you're her mate now."That was true. Maleficent never hid from anyone what happened between them. She wasn't her dirty little secret, but her mate. Still, what Helga said bothered much. Did the fairy really love her? She never told about her feelings. Everything between them began in a very sensual way, without any declaration of love or something. It was Maleficent's nature or she was just using her as a toy? Think so made it her mood worsened and nothing said by Emma made her feel better. The only alternative was to have a conversation with Maleficent and clarify what was actually going on between them.After a long day of work, Maleficent headed to Aurora's bedroom eager for another burning night, but when opened the door, she immediately noticed something was wrong to see Aurora sitting on the couch with a visibly annoyed face."Did something happen? You do not look well."Aurora wanted to know."What is happening between us?"She was caught by surprise."What is our relationship? What are we? Do you really feel anything for me?""How many stupid questions! Why are you worried about that?" She said trying to dodge the questions. She never knew how to talk about feelings and wasn't ready to have this conversation with Aurora."You didn't answer any of them! At least the last!""You foolish, if I did not feel anything, I would not be wasting time with you this way!" It was the best she could do at the moment.Wrong answer. Aurora was red-faced with rage, stood up and shouted."So you think stay with me is a waste of time?" "Only if I did not feel anything for you." She said trying to fix the mistake. "Oh, please! I would never have so much work with someone if I did not feel anything!""You mean I'm not worth?" The situation was starting to get complicated and not even Maleficent, with her sharp and fast mind, was managing to fix it."A skinny blonde like you? Do not make me laugh! Now change your clothes and let us go to my chambers. I had a stressful day and want to relax a bit. And you need to relax too." That wasn't the smartest thing she said in her life.Emma was taking clean sheets to Aurora's quarters and arrived just in time to see Maleficent outside the room with wide eyes, hear screams coming from inside and the door being slammed shut. Oh, no, she had arrived at a very wrong time!When recovered from the shock, she looked at the maid and asked showing all her displeasure and irritation."What is happening here?" The maid shook with fear and said in a low voice."It was an incident that happened this afternoon, Your Excellency..."She left there making a gesture to the maid followed her. They went to the office where Maleficent worked with the affairs of the castle and kingdom. After sitting behind a desk made of dark wood, she got down to business."Explain to me right now what happened to Aurora today. I demand to know everything!"Emma told about the incident with Helga earlier that day. Aurora didn't ask to keep a secret and even if she did, Emma couldn't disobey Maleficent's orders."Who is Helga? I will order to throw her in the dungeon right now!""Your Excellency, this may not be necessary. Aurora has given her a lesson.""But now she does not want talk to me!""She's nervous, but later will settle down. Give her a break."She pursed her lips in irritation. Then she had to spend the night alone just because of nonsense?"Talk to her." The fairy said. "She listens to you, maybe she will calm down."The only way to calm down Aurora was Maleficent ask for apologize, but it was easier a pig learn to play the harp than she do such a thing."I do not understand why she cares about this stupid things." She said scornfully."Well... Aurora is romantic, maybe it's important to her. She always read many love stories and...""These stories are ridiculous and I will not act like an idiot by anyone!"The maid thought, chose the words carefully and said."There are several ways to show feelings, Your Excellency. You don't need to do as the books say.""So what should I do?" Emma swallowed loudly and answered."Did you told her how you feel? Not those declarations of love that the books show. Just talk...""Talk? This is useless. Words without action means nothing. ""But for Aurora, it's important. And listen is also necessary.""Listen a lot of complaints and lamentations? Do you really think I have the patience for that?"Right. Apparently, Maleficent was more insensible than she expected. And also didn't know anything about love and relationships."People like to have someone to listen and understand. Especially someone as sensible as Aurora."After some thought, Maleficent said."I will order the milliner for a new dress for her. Or a diamond necklace, a tiara or perhaps a new... ""If you allow me a suggestion, Your Excellency, wouldn't better you talk to her? I think gifts will let her angrier. Especially after the incident today.""I should thrown that saucy maid to the dungeon for having insinuated that Aurora is whoring with me. This is nonsense, such a thing never crossed my mind! ""I imagine you give her gifts as a way to show your feelings, because you like take care of her."Actually, the maid said well what Maleficent felt. She liked taking care of Aurora and ensure her welfare. See the princess happy also made her happy."Why does not she see that?""If you talk, she'll understand.""I think you should talk to her, since you were able to understand it so well."The best was Maleficent say everything personally, but Emma understood that it was a little beyond what she was able to do at the moment. Well, one step at a time."I'll talk to her tomorrow, your Excellence.""I do not want to wait until tomorrow. Talk to her now." There wasn't the remotest possibility of sleep without Aurora. She needed the young woman's company, her warmth and scent. She wanted everything to be fine between them again."Yes, your Excellence." Emma didn't know if could convince Aurora in so little time, but had no choice but to obey."I don't know if it was good idea you fight with the princess." Georgei said after have used Helga's body. He was lying on his bed while the maid was dressing to leave."I just said some truths she must listen! Ouch! My arm hurts! I didn't know she was so strong! ""Apparently Maleficent doesn't know anything, otherwise you would be in the dungeon now. Be more careful next time, I don't want anything to happen to you. "The redhead smiled even knowing he was just worried about losing his toy. That's what made her more angry, know Aurora was right to say that men only wanted her body. The truth hurt, but she didn't want to admit somehow. The easiest alternative was the revenge."I will take revenge on this bitch!""Don't do nothing for now. When I own this castle, you can do whatever you want with her because Maleficent will be defeated.""Will this plan work?""Absolutely! I just need few more days to get everything ready."He was so confident that Helga believed. Georgei wasn't crazy or stupid to confront Maleficent if weren't able to win. Anyway, it cost nothing to wait a few more days. If his plan failed, then she was going to find another way to get revenge on Aurora. Her mind always had good ideas."Can you believe she said me these things?"Emma scratched her head. Maleficent hadn't told the details of the conversation between them. The fairy seemed to have serious problems with her exaggerated sincerity. It was so hard to think before say something? Aurora walked from one side to another, grumbled, cursed and swore never to talk with Maleficent again. She let the princess vent her anger and only then could talk."Do you know what I think? You have read many novels and believe that real life is like these books.""Isn't it?""Of course not! Love is more complex than the books shows. There is no perfect love without trouble. Nobody is perfect.""She could be a little more sensitive and romantic!""Uh... you know we're talking about Maleficent, don't you?"Aurora snorted angrily, but knew that Emma was right."Each one expresses love differently. Just because she doesn't do the same way as romantic stories, it doesn't mean she doesn't love you. She shows it every day, even though her way. Why you demand things she can't do?""You're right, but ...""No buts. Do you really think the only way to show love is like the books tell us? You know what? These demonstrations of love are silly and superficial. I bet Prince Philip did these things all the time, no?"It was true. Philip always gave her flowers, recited poems and sang sometimes, but in the end he was just a jerk. Maybe Emma was right. She didn't need silly demonstrations of love, but true feelings. Thinking more rationally, she knew Maleficent always took care of her. Those gifts weren't a bargaining chip, but her way of showing affection."Do you think she really loves me?""Perhaps more than we imagine. She just doesn't knows how to show it in another way. Give more time to her and have patience. Over time, you two will understand each other. ""I think you're right, but I still think she should at least be more affectionate.""Maybe she doesn't know how to do it. So teach her! ""Teach her?""Of course! Show how to be affectionate. In time she will learn. ""I never thought of that before...""Then think. And change your clothes because she's out there and won't go away without you.""What? But I...""Go, go, go! I bet you miss her so much as she misses you."She knew that Emma was right e decided to forget the anger. Maleficent was what she was. Even though couldn't change the her nature, Aurora decided it might be possible to teach her to be a little more affectionate. It didn't seem that hard to do."Is she calmer?" Maleficent asked when Emma left the room."Yes, Your Excellency. She's waiting you."The fairy smiled with satisfaction and gave to the maid a little bag full of gold coins which she accepted thanking. There was no need to pay anything, but she knew it was her way of saying thanks. Maleficent entered the room and Emma was glad to know things had been resolved. At least until the next quarrel. They had a lot to learn from each other.

The fairies were returning home after a a day visit to the palace. That day, Aurora had gone to visit her parents and they were there also to see the princess and know how her new life was. Apparently many things had changed because they had no idea that it would be possible Maleficent allow her to see her parents alone.Flora still remembered with concern when Aurora, far from her parents' ears, told them what was happening between her and Maleficent. The pink fairy almost fainted. Who could imagine that things would go that way?"Why are you like that?" Merryweather asked to see how her friend  looked worried."What? Did not you hear what Aurora said?"The other shrugged."I also think it is an absurd, but we can do nothing.""When Maleficent said they were destined to be together, in no time I thought it was like that!""I guess she did not think as well." Fauna spoke calmly looking the landscape as they flew. "But it happened and we can not do anything. Aurora is happy, I think happier than when she was with Philip. That should be enough for us."The pink fairy grumbled for a few minutes and spoke again."It is not normal!"(Merryweather) "Who decides what is normal? We are fairies and do not follow humans rules"(Flora) "But Aurora is human and..."(Fauna) "People have the right to follow their lives as they see fit, as long as they are not hurting anyone."(Flora) "The kingdom was left without an heir!"(Fauna) "Because they cling to archaic laws and do not allow a woman to reign. It is not fair to expect Aurora sacrifice herself because of these idiots laws. The kingdom is fine and we know that Maleficent is able to protect it if necessary. Do not worry about it."The green fairy looked again at the landscape, ignoring Flora's grumbling and Merryweather's complaints because of her grumbling. Why did she have to live with two so noisy fairies?Visit her parents were very good, but she couldn't stay long because their complaints and lamentations. Heavens! If they were like that only for her living with Maleficent, how would react if knew that they were a couple? Surely her mother and father could fell dead at the same time!"Hi, little baby! Is Maleficent back?" The dragon shook his head. Whenever Maleficent was traveling, Aurora took advantage to visit her parents because the fairy had given a small stock of green stones that allowed her to go from one place to another in seconds.Things between them weren't perfect but were improving with time. Now the fairy allow her to visit the parents, showing that trusted her. They argued a few times because both had a strong genius and Aurora didn't accept to be dominated in any way. When they quarreled, Aurora went to sleep in her bedroom. But that didn't last long because Maleficent was always behind her and they ended up making up. It was hard to resist when the fairy hugged her tightly and kissed her lips as if the world was ending.As she had nothing to do until Maleficent arrives, she decided to take a walk through the garden despite the snow and cold. Maleficent had given her a good fur coat and Oscar went inside comfortably snuggled."I didn't know it was so beautiful in the winter here!" She said looking at the white landscape wondering how everything was gonna be beautiful in the spring. When she went to the large central tree, something caught her attention. She knew that man, he was Maleficent's accountant. What was his name again?Georgei had just buried a silver spoon and dug another when startled to see the princess."What are you doing?"The man was very nervous. There was misfortune greater than Aurora catch him in the act? His cunning mind worked full steam ahead and he could think of an excuse."Uh... well... it's embarrassing to say this, but...""Did you steal this spoon from kitchen ?""What? No, of course not! I am an honorable man.""So?""Well... Your Highness must have seen that I'm not young and beautiful, but I still can love someone.""Are you in love? By who?" She asked curiously."A woman who lives in the village, but doesn't match my feelings. So I'm preparing a love potion. That's it! "The explanation was very good and Aurora believed, though not agree."Love must be true, you can't force someone to love you!""Well, when someone have no youth and beauty, have to use other strategies. Don't worry, I'll make her very happy!"Before Aurora say anything else, he went away hurriedly hoping she wouldn't say anything to Maleficent. It was a week before his potion was ready. Only seven days for his victory! That was why he couldn't fail. Feeling relieved, he decided to go to the village because had an important matter to take care of."Why can't I enter the kitchen?" Helga said visibly angry. Ada answered."Because you have nothing to do here. Your job is to clear the castle.""But I'm hungry!"The cook gave her a small bowl with bread, cheese and two apples."Take this and go back to your work. I don't like when the kitchen is full of people messing up my work."Helga took the food and went away shaking with rage. Of course she knew very well why Ada didn't let her enter the kitchen. It was because of her fight with Aurora. Once the princess was always in the kitchen talking with the maids, that idiot decided she should stay away not to bother her. This was a very great injustice that she didn't intend to leave unpunished.Georgei had said his plan was almost complete and she couldn't wait to get her revenge!After taking a good glass of wine, Aragon was looking at the landscape of the village through the window. How strange that place was! Although the houses and buildings were similar to those of the other kingdoms, that village was very different from what he was used to. First was the cleanliness. The streets were wide, very clean and he rarely saw horse droppings. The buildings were well done and there was several different things he hadn't seen before. One of them was the facilities that they called "sewer", which took away the wastes instead of just throwing them in the streets. The houses also had running water, something that his palace, so rich and luxurious, didn't have.Everyone had access to education in places called "schools", which were open to all villagers. Even the women could study there! There was no poverty, wars, hunger or pestilence. Everyone seemed happy and well fed. That rascal GeorgeI was very smart in wanting to have power over those lands. Alright. He was a man of his word and intended to keep the promise if the counter fulfilled his.Someone knocked on the door, pulling him from his thoughts. Speak of the devil and he doth appear."Greetings, your Majesty!" He greeted politely."Anything new?""Yes. The potion will be ready within a week, exactly. We need to plan how you and your soldiers will enter the castle without arousing any suspicion of Maleficent, otherwise we are all dead!""My soldiers are very smart and intelligent.""I have no doubt of that. To avoid any mishaps, it would be better that you enter in small groups. So..."The plan was carefully planned, from the entrance of Aragon and his soldiers until the moment when he was going to cut off Maleficent's head."She'll be vulnerable after I throw the spell. Only then you can attack.""I can't wait for this!" He scratched his beard and then asked with eyes shining strangely. "I've heard many rumors in the village about princess Aurora. It's true she's a prisoner in Maleficent's castle? ""Prisoner isn't exactly the right word, but yes. She's in the castle.""And is she as beautiful as people say?"Understanding his intentions, Georgei described Aurora as best as possible, extolling her beauty and qualities. Aragon listened in silence, but with many thoughts running through his mind. What if besides defeat Maleficent, he also rescued the princess Aurora? He could become a great hero and marry her was going to give him the right to the throne of Stefan's kingdom without bloodshed.Not to mention he needed a wife to give an heir and he couldn't think of anyone better than Aurora. With his strength and her beauty, they were going to have the most perfect children in the world!"After I cut off the Maleficent's head , I will take Aurora with me. Any objections?""Of course not, Your Majesty. Of course not!"They kept talking and making plans for the future. Everything was going right for them.Maleficent's bed was the largest that Aurora had seen in her life. Four people could sleep comfortably there. So she couldn't understand why the fairy had to sleep over her! Although thin, she was heavy.Both rested after a intense love making. Aurora tried to follow Emma's advice and be more affectionate hoping Maleficent to learn something. And yes, she learned to sleep only after the princess stroking her hair or pass the nails very lightly on her back. Sometimes Aurora was irritated, but in the end attended to fairy's wishes, who never denied her anything when she asked."Hmm... I want you to stroke my back..." she muttered turning prone."Sure. Your day was tough, wasn't it?""Well, some storms, earthquakes, a volcano erupted... only the basics. And you?" she asked after a yawn. "Did you tell your parents about us?""Sorry, I can't talk to them yet. They are very... very...""Conservatives. I know how it is. And the fairies? They know?""Yes, I told them."She turned belly up and spoke with cynicism."I would love to have seen their faces! That stupid pink fairy may have exploded!""Don't talk like that! They took care of me for 16 years, remember?""They raised a foolish, you mean. I had a lot of work to take your innocence off and I didn't finish yet!""You're impossible!" The young woman said caressing one breast and tearing gasps from fairy's lips."I bet you loved lose the innocence!""Um... really? Let's see..." her tongue ran the halo of nipple as she slowly put her body over hers."More..." the older woman whispered pushing the breast toward her mouth. Aurora wasted no time and took a nipple into mouth, sucking it gently.It was strange for someone like Maleficent be in a passive position, being touched and caressed with such love and tenderness. It was something she until then unknown because her experiences have always been very sexual, carnal and intense, but there was never any feeling. Sex with love was much better than she could imagine and they loved each other again without thinking of anything else.When they finished, Aurora snuggled up into her arms and whispered before sleep."I love you."After ensuring the princess was sleeping and couldn't hear anything, Maleficent spoke in low voice, almost imperceptible."I love you too, my princess."Finally he got a time to travel to the island of Crete, where was his last hope to defeat Maleficent. Philip was on deck watching the movement of the waves and trying to beat the sickness. Sea voyages were always long and stressful although the ship was one of the fastest of that time.What could he offer the wizard? Gold? Gemstones? His riches were scarce thanks to the taxes he had to pay the Aragon, but Aurora's kingdom was very rich and prosperous. After marrying her, all that wealth was going to be his.At the moment, he only cared about defeat Maleficent and get her out of his way. That as going to make him not only rich and powerful but also feared even by Aragon. When thought about his victory, the sickness was over. Yes, he was very close and couldn't fail!Although not needed, Aurora enjoyed working in the kitchen doing some simple works. So she could hear the gossip of the maids at first hand. They always said funny things!"Then the idiot couldn't decide which of the two women wanted to stay and ended up alone!" One of the maids told causing laughs from colleagues."He deserved it, the bastard!""Who doesn't decides, ends with nothing!"Aurora also thought it was deserved. Another maid talked about an ugly brawl between couple in the village because the woman surprised her husband with the mistress."It was pandemonium! Pandemonium! I thought she was going to kill him with a big stick!"More laughter and funny comments. When her service ended, Aurora went away red-faced from laughing so hard."I do not understand what funny you see in those silly conversations." Maleficent said in a frown."What are you doing here?" She asked finding odd the her presence in an area where only employees circulated."Nothing important. I was just passing by." She tried to disguise to not confess she was there looking for Aurora. "Why do you enjoy doing these petty jobs?""I like to feel useful and also always hear funny stories. Do you know what's the latest?"She tried to tell the story the best way possible, but couldn't pull out a single laugh from Maleficent. Maybe her mind worked differently or she simply didn't have the same sense of humor of humans."These stories are very boring. I have one better for you." Maleficent said, laughingly, how devastated a village with a big tornado and houses, animals and people flew everywhere. Aurora heard everything without understanding how she could find it funny."And there were many deaths?""Of course! It was complete chaos. Nothing like a good day of work.""It's so sad see people dying and suffering! I don't know how you can!""Years of practice." She replied with a shrug. "Suffering is inevitable for humans."How she could be so cold? Of course, Maleficent was always Maleficent. Still Aurora couldn't accept that lack of empathy."Do you never put yourself in their place?" she asked indignantly."Why would I do that? It is no big deal.""Sure, it's not with you!"Maleficent looked at her surprised with so much indignation. Humans were the most dramatic creatures she knew."I bet I would know deal with those difficulties much better than any human. You are too weak!""That's easy with power. You just snap your fingers and everything is solved."The older scowled."No need to have the power to solve these so insignificant problems. Just use the intelligence, logic and have more discipline and determination. People suffer because they exaggerate, make a big drama about the problems and everything seems worse than it really is."Aurora began to think it was useless to argue. Maleficent wasn't human and, therefore, had no way of knowing how people suffered."You are very sentimental. Why care so much about the suffering of others? Is not your problem!""Don't you feel compassion for these people?""That would not solve anything. Even though I feel some sympathy for these humans, I can not stop my work. You know chaos is necessary.""Even so..."Maleficent went away and Aurora followed."Try not to think about it because you can not do anything. By the way, I brought the shells you have asked.""Really? Thank you!""You are welcome. Be careful, someone might see!" Fairy said embarrassed with the hug Aurora had given her. Although enjoyed so much, she didn't feel comfortable with public displays of affection. That kind of thing should be done only in private!"Don't be boring! No one's watching!""Let us go to the garden. The blizzard is over."They went to the garden arm in arm. At least she wasn't ashamed of it. When they passed near the large central tree, Aurora remembered something and asked."Is it possible to make love potion?"The other's eyes widened."Love Potion? For who? Tell me right now and I will kill the bastard..." Aurora rolled her eyes."Please, stop it! I don't want to give this potion to anyone! The other day I knew GeorgeI was making a potion for a young woman, that's it."The fairy calmed. Just a little."How did you know?"Aurora told about what she had seen, including when he dug up that silver spoon. Maleficent listened in silence and with a strange expression on her face."Then he said it was to make a love potion because he is no longer young and beautiful as before.""And has he been beautiful someday?""I don't agree with what he's doing, but I felt sorry for him."She didn't answer and continued immersed in thought. There was something wrong. That ritual was used only in the preparation of very complicated and complex potions. It was necessary to mix it with a spoon of gold or silver, which needed to be buried from time to time close to a century-old tree. For all she knew, it wasn't necessary to do such a thing to make love potions, which were very simple.That idiot man was up to something and she wanted to find out quickly.After more negative from Helga, Balthazar felt even more motivated to possess this woman anyway. His financial situation was improving a lot and it was only a matter of time until he becomes so rich that she was not going to be able to reject him.The other maids watched from afar. What a foolish man! Why he was so insistent with a woman who rejected him?Helga returned to work still thinking about the conversation with Balthazar. His financial situation was improving greatly. Wouldn't it be time to see him as a possibility? He couldn't be rich now, but was very promising. And also very beautiful, passionate, submissive and ready to satisfy all her desires.On the other hand, she had the chance to be the queen of that castle next to the Georgei that, although was the ugliest man she had seen in her life, could give her a life which she always dreamed. And one day he was going to die because was no longer young. So she would be free to find a more handsome husband. Maybe Balthazar, who was so passionate and could be willing to wait a while as her lover. Why not?Georgei felt pain in the stomach when he entered the throne room and saw Maleficent very upset. Would it be a problem in finance? No, it couldn't be. Since Aragon gave him gold, he never stole a single penny again."Your Excellency sent for me?""Yes. It has come to my attention that you buried silver spoons beneath the large central tree of the garden. I know very well this procedure is only used in high magic. I demand you to give me some explanation right now.""I'm doing nothing wrong, your Excellency!" He said terrified, knowing there was no way to fool Maleficent."Love potions do not require this kind of procedure. I want to know what magic you are doing. NOW!" She growled and lightnings sparkled around her, showing that man he was in serious trouble."It's a very complicated story, something that happened long ago and ..."He tried to gain time speaking several things but without answering anything. Maleficent lost her temper, threw a thunderbolt near his feet making him jump in terror and yelled."Explain everything to me right now or I will make you into pieces!"When he thought he was going to die, some ministers come in the throne throne room leaving her angrier than she was."Idiots! How dare you interrupt me?""We're sorry, your Excellency, but you made an appointment for now about the security scheme of the northern border..." the man said totally terrified.Maleficent took a deep breath and remembered that that matter was very urgent because some people were coming into her kingdom through that border and she needed to think of a way to resolve that issue."Get out of here, you little worm. We will talk later and you will give me a lot of explanations."The man went away thanking his guardian angel for giving him more life time to think about how to get out of that trouble."I'm doomed! Doomed!" He cried walking from one side to the other pulling the little hair he still had on his head. "What will I do now? Heavens!"There was no escape or hide. If Maleficent decided search in his room, she was going to find the potion and discover his plan at the same time. After that, he would be tortured to death in the worst way.Someone knocked the door, leaving him angry."Go away, I don't want to talk to anyone!" He shouted angrily. Still, the door opened and he saw it was only Helga."Are you in trouble? What happened? ""I'm a dead man! Definitely a dead man! She'll find out my plan and finish me!"Helga was worried. If his plan was discovered, all her dreams would fall apart."You can't give up now, there has to be a way to solve this!""But no!" He shouted desperate "She'll find out my plan before this day is over! There's no avoiding it! I'm only alive because ministers appeared with an important issue and it will distract her until nightfall. ""Distract her..." she scratched her chin and had an idea. "How long do you need to finish your plan?""Four days! Four days only! I'm so close and now everything is lost! ""Maybe not! If it is possible distract her for four days, you'll have time to execute your plan. "He stopped walking and listened her."How can we distract Maleficent? It's impossible! When she wants something, never give up!""There is one thing that can keep her distracted long enough. It's easy!"Georgei was so desperate that he decided to listen Helga's plan, which could be his only salvation. And her plan was good, but had a flaw."It might work, but she isn't stupid and will quickly find out!""We just need to keep her busy for four days!""Only four days... let's see." He thought for a while and had an idea that could make that plan work. It was only a detail that was going to make all the difference.And it was a way to revenge that gossipy little princess. He was in trouble because she couldn't keep her mouth shut.

The night was coming and the meeting wasn't over yet, leaving Maleficent angry and impatient. She just wanted to end everything and sleep with Aurora. Sometimes those meetings could last late into the night, which she hated.In the courtyard of the castle, Aurora had fun with the other maids and servants while a young man played an instrument and she sang cheerfully. Maleficent didn't like when she sang for other people because believed she had to sing only for her. But the princess always dribbled her vigilance because loved to sing.Seeing she was distracted, Helga decided to act quickly."Do you wanted to see me?" Balthazar said anxious and excited. Was he finally getting her love?"Yes, my dear. I thought a lot about what you said me!""Really?" a big smile appeared on his face."Yes, I can't stop thinking about you!" She said softly, giving her best smile and showing her generous cleavage to arouse him even more. "I want to spend a night with you, but it has to be in a special place!""It will be where you want, anywhere!""Then come with me. I've prepared a special place just for us! We'll make love the whole night!"He was floating with happiness, hardly believing that his prayers were answered. Helga quickly led him to Aurora's quarters."What room is this?""This room is empty for several weeks and I have prepared it for us. I want our first night to be in the castle.""When I get rich, you won't need this castle. I'll build a big and nice house for us.""I can't wait, honey. But now, I want to be all yours!" She hugged his neck, giving him a warm kiss that soon aroused a strong reaction in the middle of his legs."You can't imagine how much I waited for this!" He said excited."Now you needn't wait any longer! We'll be very happy. How about a toast?""A toast to us!"There were two glasses of wine on the table. Helga gave one to the man and led hers to lips without drinking anything. He took a big gulp and instantly felt a terrible vertigo."What's going on..." he couldn't finish the sentence and passed quickly. Georgei came out of hiding and said satisfied."The first phase is complete. Help me out here, he's heavy!"Aurora walked through the corridors humming happily. Over her shoulder, Oscar also was happy. Only one thing made her sad."Will this meeting take much? How boring!" the little dragon squeaked in agreement. "Well... I'll try to wait for her awake, but it's hard..."As they approached her room, Oscar started growling showing his little teeth."What's up, little baby? Is there something wrong?" she asked coming into the room and saw someone else was there. "What are you doing here?" She asked very angry to see Helga sitting on her couch like she owned everything."I just came to visit you, princess."Georgei closed the door and grabbed Aurora from behind. Helga also helped hold her."Get off me, are you crazy? Oscar!" the Little dragon tried to spit fire on both and GeorgeI threw him against the wall. Before Aurora start yelling, Helga took the glass and tried to force her to drink wine. She choked, spat several times but ended up swallowing a sip and that was enough."It's done!" He said letting her fall to the ground. "Now let's take her clothes off."They undressed Aurora quickly and took her to the bedroom, where Baltazar was lying in bed totally unconscious. They put them embraced, as if were sleeping together after sex. The clothes were scattered around and they went out of there quickly before Maleficent caught them."Will she remember something?" Helga asked worried."This herb causes people to be a bit of amnesia. They won't remember what we did."Thanks to the changes he made, the plan was perfect. That herb was famous for causing faints and leave people with amnesia, unable to remember what happened minutes before ingesting it. Maleficent was going to find them soon and that could keep her distracted long enough. Even though she knew the farce, would require a long time to find the culprits. It was the time he needed to get his potion ready.Oscar stood up, shook his head and searched for Aurora, finding her lying unconscious with a strange man. More than fast he went to the throne room to look for Maleficent."What happened?" She asked to see the dragon was very nervous. Oscar flew away and she understood that Aurora could be in trouble. She didn't think twice before leaving the ministers talking alone and ran after the dragon.As she entered the room, a strong smell of wine invaded her nostrils, leaving her on alert. Who had drunk wine there? Would have been Aurora? But she vowed never to drink alcohol!"Aurora? Where are you? "Oscar went to the bedroom and Maleficent followed him, then stopping completely horrified. It was like a dagger had been nailed to her heart and she was in complete shock. No, this couldn't be happening! That wasn't possible! Her body shook and she gritted teeth with rage at the most painful betrayal that she might have suffered.In his room, GeorgeI walked from one side to another. Helga told she saw Maleficent going to the Aurora's quarters. At that time, the fairy may have found her supposedly in the arms of a man. Would the plan work? If so, he was saved. Otherwise, his suffering was going to be a hundred times worse.Helga went into her bedroom very scared."I saw her entering the princess's room, but I dared not stay. I don't want to see what she'll do with them!""You did well. I think is better you go to the accommodation of the maids and stay there until further notice."She did as ordered happy that everything is working out. Besides helping Georgei with his plan, which was going to ensure her a status as queen in the future, that was the best way to get revenge on Aurora. Maleficent was going to kill her in the worst possible way!She woke up with a very strong buzz and her head was throbbing horribly. A bitter taste invaded her mouth and she realized someone else was lying by her side. Aurora opened her eyes and stood up quickly to see a man lying with her. But the worst thing was to see Maleficent looking like wanted to kill her."I..." she tried to speak but couldn't because Maleficent rushed against her and slapped her face throwing her to the ground."You traitor! How can you do this to me? How dare you?" Fairy screamed hysterically lifting her off the ground by pulling the hair and shaking her hard. "You betrayed me! You broke your promise! I will never forgive you for this, did you hear me? Never!""Wait, I did nothing!" Aurora cried feeling the aching face and a trickle of blood running down her nose. Another slap was struck on her face, knocking her down again. Maleficent then grabbed her by the neck and made her look at the bed where the man also woke up totally dazed and unaware of what was happening. "Do you thought you could lie with your lover under my nose, you miserable? Do you thought I would not find out?"Oscar tried to stop her biting the fabric of her cape, but in vain. He couldn't stop her."Maleficent, wait! I swear I didn't do anything!" Aurora said trying to dodge the Fairy's strong grip. If she squeezed a little more, could break her neck."Stop lying! At least have the decency to tell the truth!"The screams could be heard from the corridors and Emma shook with fear. She wanted to help Aurora, but wasn't crazy to face Maleficent."Stop, please stop! I didn't cheated on you!" Aurora begged crying. Her tears wet the Maleficent's hand and suddenly she realized what was doing and immediately opened the hand, letting her fall to the ground. The young woman was with bruised face, a bloody nose and cried desperately."No... Aurora..." she murmured regaining some of her sanity and tried to help her."Please don't hurt me anymore! I swear I didn't do anything, I swear!" The princess cried in fetal position in an attempt to protect herself. "I did do nothing, I didn't!"Maleficent looked at her shocked at what she had just done. Not that she wasn't capable of beat and hurt someone, but for having done that with who she never wanted to hurt. Her heart ached even more.Balthazar stood up trying to cover himself with a blanket and was totally terrified. What he was doing naked in princess Aurora's bed? Why was she naked too? He saw that Maleficent was also there and even not knowing what was happening, he knew he was in serious trouble.Seeing the man standing up from the bed, the fairy looked at him with much hatred. It was all the fault of that bastard and she didn't intend to leave him unpunished! He tried to run but was caught by her that, mad with hate, dragged him out of the room while beating furiously. Some guards appeared and she ordered them to throw the man in the dungeon. That idiot was going to die very slowly and in the worst possible way.Several nobles and courtiers appeared in the hallways to see what was happening and soon ran out when she fired several rays furiously screaming and destroying everything she saw ahead. Her heart was totally broken and nothing was going to relieve that pain.After the fairy was gone, Emma entered the room very worried with Aurora. The room was a mess. Various furniture was destroyed by Maleficent's rays. Inside the bedroom was the same mess and she saw Aurora lying on the floor, still naked and totally in shock."Oh, no! What happened?" she tried to help her up carefully.Aurora couldn't say anything. Her face ached, just like the rest of her body."Come, lie down in bed. Heavens, your face!" she had a huge bruise under left eye and her nose was bleeding badly. she also had bruises on her neck and cuts caused by Maleficent's fingernails. "Please, say something!"She just trembled, with wide eyes and many tears streamed down her face."She... she... hit me! Why Emma? Why did she do it? I did nothing! Who was that man?" the princess cried desperately, leaving Emma desolate. Everything became clear to her. Someone made a trap for Aurora to do Maleficent think she had betrayed her. And this filthy plan worked perfectly."Don't you remember anything?"Try as she might, Aurora couldn't remember anything. All she could remember was being having fun with the maids in the castle courtyard. Thereafter, a total blank invaded her mind.Seeing she was unable to explain anything, Emma helped her bathe and nursed the wounds. Then decided to tidy the room as best she could thinking how to discover the truth."What happened here, Oscar? Oh, if you could talk!" the little dragon must have seen it all and know the truth. "I'll find out who did this to her. Hmm... maybe I can talk to the man who was in bed with her. I hope Maleficent didn't kill him yet!"When picked a Aurora's dress which was thrown to the ground, Oscar approached and started sniffing it. It was dirty with wine."Weird... Aurora drank wine? But she promised don't drink anymore! And why she shed so much wine on clothing? Ew, what a disgusting smell!"It was a strong, sour smell that didn't seem a bit like wine. It could be a clue and she decided to keep the dress to show to Maleficent later.Aurora was still lying in bed crying and she felt really bad for leave her alone. But there was no alternative. If found there, Maleficent could even kill her."Stay here with her. I'll try to find out what happened. "Several shelves with herbs, potions and other magical materials was destroyed. Tables, chairs, pots, tools... everything turned to ashes. Maleficent ripped the drawings one by one. There were so many that occupied an entire wall and portrayed the only person she had loved: Aurora."Your miserable, why did you do that? Why did you betray me?" She shouted as tore a drawing of Aurora using one of the nightdress she had given her. "Why?"The drawings didn't answer anything. Only Aurora could answer something, but she didn't want to know, she just wanted a relief for that excruciating pain. Why she made the mistake of keep the princess in her castle? Why didn't let her go with her parents? All that pain would have been avoided.When tore the last drawing, Maleficent fell to her knees completely exhausted and distressed. The pain in heart was worse than when Philip struck her with his sword. It was worse than anything she had felt. Why did it hurt so much?See Aurora in that man's arms was the worst thing that could have happened to her. She thought princess's love was only hers, thought she was loved and had found someone who accepted her as she was. But no. The princess didn't love her. She had been lying all this time maybe to get gifts and privileges. It was the only explanation.Anyway, explanations were useless. Her half had betrayed her. That's it. Around her neck, still there was the black pendant and she wanted to throw it away, but had no courage. Despite all the pain and anguish, she still loved Aurora with all her strength and couldn't hate her, as much as tried. This let her angry at herself for being so weak to love someone who didn't love her. And it was possible for someone to love her? A fairy with difficult temper, pale, almost green, who caused chaos and tragedies throughout the world? How much naivety!But she still loved Aurora and just wanted everything to be just a nightmare and to wake up with Aurora in her arms. No, it wasn't a nightmare. It was harsh and sad reality. A liquid trickled down her face. It was a salty liquid that came out of her eyes. What was that? Tears? No way! Crying was for weak and foolish humans, not for the most powerful fairy on Earth! She didn't cry!More than quickly she wiped the tears and more fell. Tears flowed from her eyes again and again. Finally she gave up and let them fall freely, putting out all the pain and anguish of being betrayed, to love and not be loved. How to live her life from now on?Through news given by Helga, Georgei knew Maleficent was locked in her lab for two days. After that incident, she had completely forgotten him and this gave him time to finish the potion."Perfect, absolutely perfect!" He said after stirring the potion with the silver spoon. His victory was near."No one can talk with the prisoner!" The guard said grumpy and threatening to draw the sword."Please, it's urgent! I think they made a trap for Aurora and I want to find the truth."Still the guard didn't want to budge."It's not my problem. Orders are orders." Emma decided to argue. The guards were brutes, but not stupid. "Since Aurora arrived, Maleficent became softer with everyone."He hesitated a little."If this continues, she can get much worse than was before! She'll take it out on all of us, including you!"The guard's eyes widened, he grunted a few times and finally agreed."Be quick. If she sees you here, we're both dead!"The scene was depressing. Baltazar was still naked, chained, with his body filled with injuries and bruises. And she knew Maleficent hadn't even begun to torture him."My goodness, did she do this to you?""Please help me! I don't know what happened!" The man cried begging."You were found on princess Aurora's bed, totally naked and hugged her! Do you understand how serious this is?"His despair grew even more."I didn't do anything with her, swear! I never even looked at the princess!""But Maleficent think something happened and she is furious. Someone set a trap and I need find out the truth. How did you end up in Aurora's bed?"The unfortunate man tried, but couldn't remember anything."Please, it's important! Your life depends on it! If the truth isn't discovered, I don't want think about what Maleficent will do! "Desperate to save his life, Baltazar made a monumental effort and tried to remember everything that had happened that day from the time of waking. Everything seemed normal, unless..."Did you find out anything?""The only different thing that happened was a letter sent by Helga making a date. I remember being very happy because, you know, she never wanted anything with me.""And after that, what happened?""I came running to the castle to meet her and... and..." however hard he tried, he couldn't remember anything and Emma realized the same had happened to Aurora. Both couldn't remember what had happened before that incident. Coincidence? Certainly not.The guard warned her about the danger of staying there and the maid decided to leave."Please help me! I don't want to die!" The man begged before she left."I'll do my best, I promise!"She left the dungeon very suspicious of Helga, who certainly was be taking revenge on Aurora. At least one piece of the puzzle was unveiled. Someone drugged and put them together in bed. That strange smell in Aurora dress left no doubt. But to find out the truth it would be necessary Maleficent's help, which was difficult for a while.Since that day, she was locked in lab and didn't leave for anything."I hope everything is resolved!"Lying on her bed , Aurora felt eyes hurt from so much crying. She hadn't understood what happened and why that man was lying on her bed. But understood very well that Maleficent, for the first time, had hurt her. The physical pain was strong, but her heart ached much more. Why didn't she heard her? Why didn't try discover the truth before jumping to conclusions? Maleficent didn't trust her. She never trusted."Oscar, my little baby! What will I do? I'm very afraid!" For the first time since was living in the castle, Aurora was afraid of Maleficent and realized how the fairy could be cruel and dangerous. Even after everything that had happened between them, she didn't hesitate to hit her like that. It made Aurora see fairy's love simply didn't exist. She was just using her as a toy. There was no other explanation.Maleficent wasn't jealous because love her but to see her as a property. In the end, the fairy wasn't capable of loving anyone and Aurora realized she must run away quickly before was killed. but where to run to? Maleficent was able to find her anywhere in the world. She had nowhere to go."So that's it... I have to stay here and face my fate!" her tears came back full force and Oscar tried to comfort her. He knew what had happened and was going to to defend Aurora until the end.She tried to get up, but her body ached to much."Don't try to get up." Emma said entering the bedroom."Did you see her today, Emma?""No. She's still locked in the lab.""I am afraid! When she get out of there, will...""Look, if she wanted to do something, would have done!""She did, look to my face! This is only the beginning! What do I do now?"The maid didn't know what to answer. The situation was very delicate and she was afraid of Maleficent to do something before being convinced Aurora had fallen into a trap."What's happening to me?" Aurora asked scratching her skin, which was red, flaking and with some injuries. "Did she curse me?""I think not. I don't know what it is, never seen anything like it and don't know how to help! Maybe another bath?""My skin hurts a lot, put water is worse! But it isn't my biggest concern. If only she would listen to me...""She'll hear you, I know! Try to stay calm. I'm investigating to find out what happened and I promise do anything to help.""I don't know how to thank you, Emma!""That's fine, now try to sleep. I don't think she'll come today."Aurora tried to sleep again, which was difficult because of that strange disease on her skin. And also for fear of Maleficent, which she was feeling for the first time. 

It was dawn and it was still dark when Maleficent finally left the laboratory totally exhausted. It was time to face reality and the world. That time alone made her think about many things and as she was calming down, her thoughts became more lucid.And one thing she understood was that humans made mistakes. Always. It may have been what happened to Aurora. One mistake. She knew from experience that sex and love are different things. After all, she never loved any of lovers who had in the past. They were just toys to play in moments of boredom.Knowing the princess had sex with someone else still hurt her, but think it was just physical attraction without any feeling alleviated her pain. She wanted to believe Aurora didn't love that man and just wanted to try his body, nothing else. It could be just curiosity, physical attraction, maybe he'd seduced her with these idiots love declarations which Aurora liked...If it were true, if Aurora said she never loved that man and promise never do it again, so Maleficent was willing to forgive and forget. That young woman was her half, love and life. She didn't want to give up the only person who ever loved because of a mistake.That crisis could be overcome, they could make up and everything was going to be fine again. She knew she was wrong to hit Aurora and was willing to compensate her. Gifts, jewelry, dresses and whatever she wanted... And, of course, never do that again. The image of Aurora crying, with wounded face and trembling with fear wasn't never going out of her mind and she didn't want that to happen again.The bedroom was dark and she stepped carefully without make noise. Emma had tidied the place, which was good. She should also take care of Aurora. The young woman was sleeping with Oscar by her side. The little dragon awoke and stood on guard, but soon saw the fairy had come in peace. The dim light of the moon illuminated the body that slept in a restless sleep. Maleficent stroked hair her gently, feeling the heart ache to see how her face had been. No, she was never going to do that again. How could she have been so unreasonable?Then something rough on Aurora's skin of caught her attention. Her skin was flaking and some parts had injuries and nail marks, indicating that it also itched. Maleficent pulled the blanket to look better and saw her body covered with this strange thing. What was happening? Was the princess sick?She knew that humans could get sick because of stress or trauma and this hurted her conscience, something that surprised her much because she didn't know she had one.Aurora moaned low and scratched one arm, then turned to the other side and continued sleeping. At the moment she couldn't do much, only watch her sleep. So Maleficent was right there next to the bed, as she wouldn't sleep without her.Emma entered the bedroom carrying a tray with breakfast and was surprised when saw Maleficent beside Aurora's bed, who was still sleeping. The fairy motioned for the maid to keep silent and they went to the office where could talk privately.When the sun lit the bedroom, Maleficent saw that the Aurora's situation was worse than she thought. That thing had taken much of her body and she knew what it was. All that was left was to figure out how Aurora had contracted that allergy."I want to know what happened that day.""Nothing happened, Your Excellency, I swear Aurora is innocent! Someone made a trap for her, I know!"The fairy felt a bad thing in the stomach because hadn't thought of such a possibility."I know you see Aurora as a friend, but you still owe me loyalty and I demand to know the whole truth. You will not be punished.""I'm telling the truth! Aurora never had anything with that man! She doesn't know him!""So how he ended up in her bed?""Somebody may have drugged them."The bad feeling intensified. Heavens, why didn't she thought about it? How could she have been so stupid? "Who could have drugged Aurora?"Emma told her about the clues she had found and her conversation with Baltazar. "He can't remember anything, just like Aurora.""So they are with amnesia. Do you still have Aurora's dress?"Emma ran to get the dress and come back quickly. The clothe still had the stain of wine and Maleficent examined carefully and smelled. That strong, sour smell could only be the Sleep Flower extract. That herb was used to drug people and leave them unconscious for a while. One of the reasons the plant was highly sought after was to cause amnesia in victims, which could last for several days.That also explained the strange allergy because some people were extremely sensitive to this plant. Luckily, she knew how to heal that allergy that brought much suffering to Aurora and decided to take care of that before discover the bastard who drugged her. After making some notes on a piece of paper, she ordered."Make an infusion of these herbs. It has to be enough to fill a bathtub and should be warm, but comfortable.""Yes, Your Excellency, I'll do that right now."Emma ran to fulfill orders and Maleficent went to her laboratory to get a special oil to heal Aurora's wounds. Of course, if she has left something without break or burn. The place was a mess and she cursed herself for having destroyed so many important things. What had happened to her? Although she wasn't the most calm person in the world, she wasn't an irrational and uncontrolled creature. She could be cruel to those who betrayed her, but generally gave the person a chance to defend.Why with Aurora, her only love, was different? And how could she believe in so childish farce? If she had investigated, would have figure out everything in less than an hour. How she was stupid!Her drawings were thrown to the ground, all torn. She picked one and tried to join the two halves, unsuccessfully. Even if she could glue the two halves, the mark was still there. What nasty! She had made those drawings with much care and never showed any of them to Aurora."Trying to fix this is a waste of time. In the future, I will make others better and nicer." She thought giving up on fixing those drawings. But she wasn't going to give up to fix her relationship with Aurora.Knowing her mate was innocent filled her with joy and relief, but also with anguish and shame because of her attitudes three days ago. Aurora should be very hurt and scared and Maleficent didn't know how to make amends with her.Asking for forgiveness should be the first step, but she had no idea how to do it, once had never done such a thing before. No... ask apologize was idiocy. Just words and nothing more. The most important thing was never repeat the same mistake again and also compensate Aurora. That was what she intended to do."Aurora always wanted to see the sea. I can arrange this easily. Maybe take her to meet other countries?" The idea was great. The young woman always liked to hear her stories about different people and exotic cultures, so she'd love to see everything with her own eyes. Maleficent remembered when Aurora had seen the drawing of a tiger and showed the desire to see a real one. If she wanted to see a tiger, so she was going to see a tiger and any other animal she wanted.Helga looked by far Maleficent going to the Aurora's quarters and was very worried. The fairy no longer seemed angry or furious, showing she have probably noticed everything was a farce. How long would it take to find the culprits? Her body trembled just thinking about the punishment she'd suffer if it happened."I hope the asshole's plan works, or I am dead!" She thought distressed and went away quickly before she was seen.In her bathroom, Aurora waited for Emma to prepare the bath which, she said, could heal her allergy."So she knows I didn't do it.""Yes, now everything will be fine, right?"She lowered her head. Her face still hurt because of suffered aggression. How could she forget that? Even though she did something wrong, Maleficent had no right to hit her."I... I don't know if I can forgive her, Emma. What she did still hurts so much!"The maid continued filling the bathtub with the infusion of herbs without know what to say. For such a romantic and sensitive young woman, to deal with that kind of aggression should be really difficult."I'm thinking about leave, come back to my father's palace and..."Emma's eyes widened."Don't do it, Think better!""I thought! She did it once and can do it again, maybe even worse! "She stopped what was doing and grabbed Aurora's shoulders."Listen, I know deep down you don't want to do that."

"You still love her, I know that!""But she doesn't love me! She just sees me as her property, something she can do whatever she wants!""Please don't say it! Of course she loves you! Yes, I know what she did was horrible, I know you're hurt and scared, but try to put yourself in her place.""Put me in her place?" Emma took a deep breath and continued."Someone like Maleficent isn't used to demonstrate love and feelings. She loves you but doesn't know how to act or what to do.""She always had insanely jealous and hit me up!""I think she is very afraid of losing you. When she saw you in bed with Balthazar, she may have gone mad because thought you don't love her."Aurora listened in silence."What she did was wrong, but it isn't fair you to give it up so easily! At least try to talk to her, to clear things up, say how you feel! Give her another chance, forgive!""Forgive... I do not know... if she even apologize..."

"It's her way. What counts is the intention. She loves you, but has her own way of showing it. Learn to understand it and you'll be happier with her.""She can hit me again.""If that happens, then you should go. But first, give her another chance, a vote of confidence. You love her, don't let it die because of a crisis...""I... I'll think about it."When finished preparing the bath, Emma called Aurora to get into the tub. Seeing she was having trouble to undress, Emma offered."Do you want help?" she said and fell silent when Maleficent went into the bathroom.Aurora trembled and avoided looking directly at her, causing the fairy felt very bad about herself. The young woman was scared and she couldn't blame her. It was going to take some time to regain her trust."I will take care of you now, do not worry." she said with a soft and gentle voice that Aurora had never heard before. Gradually, she was calming down and let Maleficent help her undress.It was a great relief when she plunged into herbal infusion that stopped the itching and burning that bothered her so much. Maleficent gently rubbed a sponge on her body to help her skin to better absorb the nutrients of the infusion.They were silent and Aurora had no courage to face her. And Maleficent didn't want to force a dialogue. Gradually, Aurora was losing the fear that Maleficent would hurt her and tried to relax very relieved to have been free of pain and itching.When the water has cooled, Maleficent helped her out of the bathtub, dried her body and applied a oil to moisturize and heal her skin. With this treatment, her skin was going to improve within a few days. Clean, feeling great relief and somewhat sleepy because of the bath, the princess lay in bed and Maleficent sat down beside gently stroking her hair. Shortly after Aurora was asleep and Maleficent stayed beside her for a few more minutes before leaving.Taken every care not to wake her, the fairy gently kissed her lips and whispered."I love you so much, my princess." And left there willing to find out who had made that trap for Aurora. That person was going to die in a most slow, painfully and cruel way she could imagine.After the fairy was gone, Aurora opened her eyes and touched the lips where she had kissed. It was a kiss full of love and tenderness, things she didn't used to see on Maleficent frequently. And the words she had just heard still echoed in her head like a sweet song making her believe that maybe everything could be fine again."Will it take long?" Helga said feeling very anxious."Tomorrow before noon, Maleficent will be defeated.""Will this really work? She's very powerful!"He replied almost offended."This potion is the result of many years of work and study. Everything was carefully calculated and I know it will work perfectly. How is the king Aragon? Did you hid him as I said?""Yes. He is waiting for the right time to act. The guards were hidden elsewhere in the castle where no one goes.""That's perfect. Now it's just a matter of time.""Maleficent has realized that Aurora's betrayal was a fraud. She won't take long to figure out it was us!""Until then, the potion will be ready. Trust me, darling, everything will be alright!"Helga smiled, trying to show that trusted him, but actually was very scared. If everything went well, the rewards would be great. But if things went wrong...Interrogate Balthazar was useless. The man was still with amnesia and couldn't give any details of what had happened. She distrusted Helga and thought of questioning her, but first wanted more information, so went to her lab to prepare something very special to solve the problem of his amnesia.Night had fallen and Aurora was happy for her skin didn't itch anymore. She had bathed with those herbs twice more that day and used moisturizing oil. Maleficent had a formidable knowledge of herbs and potions and was able to use for good things if she wanted."You ate better today." said Emma to see Aurora had eaten everything she brought."I'm feeling better now. What a relief!""It seems it isn't only because of your skin. You made amends with her, wasn't it?"She told about the kiss and the declaration of love that Maleficent had done thinking she was asleep. Emma said triumphantly."See? She loves you! You can't doubt it.""Why didn't she tell me directly?""Maybe because she has fear, or don't know how. But stay calm, one day she will. Have patience."Before Aurora just wanted to leave the castle, but after what had happened she decided to give another chance to Maleficent. The hurt was still there, as well as the fear of it happening again. But she wasn't going to accept any kind of abuse, neither physical nor emotional. Their relationship needed to change, otherwise no deal. She was willing to accept Maleficent's faults and limitations, but never being submissive, much less being treated as an object without a will. That relationship had to be egalitarian. If the fairy wasn't able to accept this, then she wanted to go no matter the consequences. Respect was critical and she was never going to budge at this point."How is she doing?" Maleficent asked when Emma left the room after taking care of Aurora."She is doing well, Excellency. In time everything will be fine.""Are you talking to her?""Yes. She is still hurt and scared, but she doesn't intend to leave.""If everything goes well between us again, you will be well rewarded. Now you can go, I will stay with her."Emma thanked, bowed and withdrew. She didn't do it for reward, although gold coins were always welcome. She did out of friendship and because liked Aurora. Since the princess was living in the castle, Maleficent had become less severe with everyone, which was a great advance for her.Aurora was settling under the covers when Maleficent entered the bedroom carrying a book. The two looked at each other in silence and none of them knew what to do. Finally Aurora decided to take the initiative because couldn't live in fear forever. "My skin doesn't itch anymore." She said in a low voice. This encouraged Maleficent talking too."Tomorrow will be much better. Now lie down. I brought a very good book to read for you. It is about an ancient Hindu legend."

"Yes. When you are better and my duties allows, I intend to lead you to know India. There are beautiful tigers in this country and you will see one as always wanted."It was rewarding to see, for the first time in days, her eyes shine with joy. She opened the book and started reading, translating the text that was in Hindi.Aurora listened attentively the beautiful story and was eager to meet that so exotic country. She knew Maleficent was doing it to compensate her, but wasn't upset this time. At least it was a sign that the fairy cared about her enough to want to make up for what had done. Nevertheless, she knew that their future was going to be very complicated. For now, she just wanted a little peace.The next day, about ten o'clock in the morning, Maleficent and Emma went to the dungeon. The fairy was carrying a bottle containing a liquid of yellowish appearance and sure she was close to discovering the truth."Will this potion make him remember everything, Your Excellency?" Emma asked very curious."Yes. He will remember anyway, but it may take many days and I do not want to wait anymore to punish the bastard who did it to Aurora.""It wouldn't be better to give this potion to her?"Maleficent shook her head and replied."This potion has horrible side effects. It causes a lot of headaches, nausea, diarrhea and in some cases, hair loss. The person may be sick for several days. I would never give something like this to Aurora."In the cell, Baltazar was a little recovered from the injuries and the guard gave him some clothes since he had been brought there totally naked. He was still chained and waiting for his death any minute. The man almost dirtied the pants when the fairy entered the cell. She got straight to the point. "This may cost your life, so you better collaborate with me or I won't have any mercy. Do you understand?" She roared, fierce and frightening as ever. He nodded his head praying for his soul and she continued. "Now take this bottle and drink all the liquid in it."He hesitated, fearing it was poison. Maleficent shouted angrily."Do what I ordered right now or I will break every bone in your body!"Without thinking twice, he drank all the liquid from bottle quickly ignoring the bitter and burnt taste. In the first minutes nothing happened. Then his head began to spin and ache and an avalanche of thoughts invaded his mind overwhelmingly."What's going on with him, Your Excellency?""He is retrieving the blocked memories."They waited a few minutes and when she saw he was able to speak, Maleficent asked again."What happened that day? Tell me everything and do not hide anything, otherwise I will end up with your life!"After an effort to organize thoughts, Balthazar told everything that had happened after he come to the castle. The words come out of his mouth automatically and he couldn't help himself. Maleficent listened intently, feeling the blood boil of hatred. That miserable maid named Helga had taken him to Aurora's quarters under the promise of a night of sex. After she gave him wine with Sleep Flower and he passed out. Although he didn't know the rest of the story, she could understand everything.When Aurora arrived at her room, she must have been forced to drink that wine, which explained the large stains on her dress. After their clothes were taken and they were placed on the bed hugging each other as if were lovers. Yes... everything became clear as water and she tried to control herself to not to destroy everything around. It was better to keep all her anger for that miserable maid.

Nobody understood why Helga was being dragged by the guards. The woman cried begging for mercy, but they didn't listen because were just following orders. When they arrived to the throne room, she was thrown at Maleficent's feet, who looked her angrier than ever."You will pay dearly for what did to Aurora!" Fairy roared fiercely lifting her by the hair and shaking as if she were a rag doll.So that was it. Maleficent figured out the truth and everything had collapsed over her head. Lying was useless, no one could fool the most powerful fairy in the world. Without blinking, she started begging for her life."Please, Your Excellency, I beg you! Don't kill me, please!"Maleficent looked at her with that devilish look which terrified the bravest of men."Your insignificant and filthy bitch, there are far worse things than death and it will be a great pleasure to show you some of them!"When Helga cried of despair, Maleficent smiled wickedly. The more fear the maid had, better. It was only the beginning of her torment."Mercy, Your Excellency, mercy! I swear it wasn't my idea, I just obeyed orders!""Then it was Helga?""Yes, it was she who drugged you. Strange...""Strange why? You know she hates me!""That's not it. I think is very strange she had done it all alone. She may have had help from someone."Aurora tried to remember, but her memories were confused."I think so, but it's all jumbled. Let me see..." she thought for a moment and said again. "Someone grabbed me from behind and I remember his voice... it was a familiar man's voice...""Try to remember, this is important. There's no point in punishing Helga and let her accomplice free.""Ready! It's finally ready! And just in time!" Georgei screamed happy and triumphant. His potion was ready and all he needed to do was use it on Maleficent. The liquid was evaporated to remain one dose, exactly the amount he needed.After filling the bottle, he took a deep breath and went to the throne room to put his plan into action. And he needed to be quick, because Maleficent had caught Helga and he didn't want the maid to be killed. Not that he cared about her, just didn't want to lose his mistress and accomplice. She could be useful to him in the future."So did you get help? I should known a stupid little maid like you would not be able to handle something as complicated as Sleep Flower. Well, talk right now who was responsible for this farce and I promise your death will be quick."The woman trembled before the imminent death. Why didn't Georgei come to help? Where that miserable was? Did the potion fail and he fled leaving her alone to deal with Maleficent's wrath? Just to be sure, she decided to save time waiting for him to appear at any time to defeat that demon."What are you waiting for? Talk Now! Or by chance you are lying to save yourself? If so, I will rip every piece of your body!"She swallowed loudly and said trying to hold back the tears."He is a very influential person at court, Your Excellency, I have no evidence against him and...""Enough! Just tell me his name and I will know the truth!""Yes, yes... he grabbed me from behind and Helga made me drink wine. I spit several times and... damn, my head hurts!"Emma insisted."Try to remember, it's important! He made you suffer too much because of this rotten plan!""But Maleficent hit me because didn't believe me! It still hurts.""Aurora, calm down! Over time you'll solve it, but if he's still in the castle, will bring more suffering to you. Try to remember!"She took a deep breath trying to calm down and searched in memory where knew that voice. It was a familiar voice that she had heard several times. The voice of an old man and somewhat unpleasant to hear.As was seeking in memory, everything became clear to her."Heavens! I know who was with Helga!"More than fast, Aurora put a dress, shoes and ran to the throne room to speak with Maleficent. That filthy man might be able to make worse things and she couldn't allow."This is your last chance to have a quick and painless death. Who is responsible for drugging Aurora?"Before Helga answered, a voice spoke."I can explain everything, Excellency." Georgei entered the throne room boldly."You..." she snarled narrowing her eyes. Of course, she should have known. That farce was made for her forget the episode of the silver spoon. "Yes, I was responsible for drugging that skinny and useless princess. I never liked her and also don't like you!"All presents widened eyes with such audacity. If that mad man wanted to die, wouldn't be more easy and painless to jump from the highest tower of the castle?"Your filthy and miserable worm! You will pay dearly for this, I swear!" she yelled furious and ready to shoot lightning with her cedar. Georgei advanced against her ready to end it all. Helga went out of the way, going to hide behind a pillar and outside Aragon waited with his soldiers the right time to act."I'll finish you, demon!" He shouted, uncapped the bottle and threw the liquid toward the fairy who, blindsided, couldn't dodge and also hadn't bothered with it since she was immune to most potions. But not all.A green glow filled the throne room, making everyone to cover their eyes. After the glow disappeared leaving only Maleficent fallen on the ground and moaning in pain."What did you do miserable?" She tried to get up and shoot lightning with the cedar, but failed. What happened to her powers? Why she felt so weak?Seeing the potion worked, Georgei laughed hysterically."Victory! I made it! Finally I made it!"Upon hearing the combined signal, Aragon entered the throne room with his guards and saw Maleficent lying on the floor totally defenseless."Is she defeated?" The king asked wanting to make sure."Defeated and as helpless as a small child Majesty!"Helga came out of hiding and approached laughing."Who's the insignificant bitch now?"Maleficent growled and tried to get up to fight, but her body didn't obey. In fact, that didn't seem her body.When reached the throne room, Aurora saw something was wrong. There were many strange people there, screams and laughter. "What's going on? Maleficent!" It was a shock to see the fairy fallen on the floor with that bearded man in front of her holding a sword and she ran to her mate. "Maleficent, what happened? Who are them?"Helga couldn't resist and replied."Now everything has changed, shit princess!"She ignored the redhead and tried to help Maleficent get up. Aragon raised his sword and ordered."Get out of there now. I'll cut the head of this monster!""What? No way! Leave her alone!"Aurora stood in front of Maleficent trying to protect her and Aragon lowered his sword for a moment. Despite her appearance to be bad because he knew she was sick, she was still a princess and his chance to conquer the Stefan's kingdom. And her appearance was going to better with time."Princess Aurora, this demon kept you prisoner here for over a year. See how she left you! This creature doesn't deserve your pity.""She isn't a 'creature' and I'll protect her!""Now I see she bewitched you. Come with me, princess, don't risk your life for someone who doesn't deserves. If you come with me, will be my wife and my queen."Maleficent felt his heart ache. As painful as that was, she wished Aurora to accept the king's proposal save her life. She'd rather that than see Aurora being killed along with her."Marry me and you'll see your parents again, will be the queen of the most powerful king of all and will have an immense amount of wealth at your feet!" He said with a soft voice trying to convince her.Helga pressed her lips with anger and envy. Besides being an immensely rich and powerful king, Aragon was way more beautiful, youthful and attractive than Georgei and with him Aurora was going to become a queen. That shitty princess lost the battle, but won the war and Helga felt like screaming with hate.He reached out and asked again."Come with me, Princess Aurora, come with me and I promise you'll have the world at your feet."Aurora lifted her arm to accept his hand and Maleficent lowered the head not to see her princess walking away with that bastard. It was the end of everything and there was nothing she could do. 

When their hands almost touched, Aurora shouted suddenly."Oscar, now!" The little dragon came out from behind her and spat fire at king's face burning his beard. This gave Aurora time to grab  Maleficent by arm making her to get up and they ran away.Everyone were caught by surprise and the guards didn't know whether should to help the king or chase the princess. Taking advantage of their distraction, Aurora closed the door and commanded Oscar spit fire inside the lock, melting it inside and arresting everyone in the throne room."What are you doing?" Maleficent asked stunned with everything."Saving our lives. Now come on, we gotta get out of the castle!"They ran through the hallways and met with Emma."What's up?""We have to run away now, help us!""Come with me!"Emma took them out of the castle and they saw that there were many guards in the courtyard and they weren't Maleficent's guards."They're guards of that king! If they see Maleficent, will attack us!""I know where there is another way out." Fairy said coming out of the shock and they rushed to the garden. In a stone wall, hidden by various vines, there was a passage that only Maleficent knew."You never told me about this passage!" Aurora complained.She said nothing and opened the passage through which they fled."You have to escape too, Emma! Helga hates you and can kill you!"The maid nodded and they left by the passage, which closed shortly thereafter. They went down the mountain along a narrow path, which was a big challenge for Maleficent. Why her body was so weak and weird?After a long descent, they reached the base of the mountain and hid in the forest to rest and decide a new direction. They couldn't remain around the castle.Within minutes, guards broke down the door and Aragon screamed furious for having lost Aurora and Maleficent. His beard had been partially burned and his pride was hurt too. If that miserable princess wanted things that way, then it was good for him. The kingdom of her parents was going be invaded and everyone killed without mercy."They shouldn't have gone very far." Georgei said calmly. He had fulfilled his part of the agreement. If Aragon failed to stop two weak women, it was his problem. "Order your guards search the castle.""I'll do that right now!"They walked away, leaving Helga with Georgei."And now, what will you do?""I'll be the new owner of this castle, my dear." He said sitting comfortably on Maleficent's throne. "Oh, I always wanted to sit on this throne! How wonderful!"She smiled sweetly and sat on his lap, giving him a warm kiss."I hope you don't forget me! Maleficent threatened me several times, but I didn't denounced you.""I never forget who helps me. Now you'll have everything you want!"Her eyes shone. Finally her days of hardship were over. If all went well, she would become his wife and also owner of that castle. But for now, she wanted all Aurora's beautiful jewelry, knowing that no lady of that castle had anything like it. That was only the beginning of her luxurious life.Maleficent was panting heavily, trying to catch her breath. Aurora, Emma and even Oscar looked at her with wide eyes without believe what they were seeing. Things were worse than they thought!"Why do you look at me like that? What happened to me?" Aurora hesitated a lot, not knowing how to say this."Uh... you're... I mean, now you are... are..." she raised both hands and Maleficent did the same, screaming in despair soon after."No! This can not be happening! It is a nightmare, a nightmare!" The woman walked from one side to another screaming hysterically and Aurora had to hold her and cover her mouth before someone heard."Maleficent, stop! Someone can hear us!""I do not care anymore! This body is horrible, disgusting, filthy! I would rather die than live like this!"Aurora put her hands on hips and shouted vigorously."Stop it right now! You aren't horrible and your body isn't disgusting!""But now I am... am..." she swallowed a few times, her lips twisted and she finally uttered the terrible word that defined her new condition. "Human! I became human! What a horror! Calamity! Tragedy!"She screamed again walking from one side to another complaining of her new situation. Her face had completely human traits, with a rosy skin and white eyes with green iris. Her pointed ears became rounded and the horns disappeared, leaving the leather bands that covered them spread over her head. Again, Aurora struggled to calm her and know what was happening."Maleficent, calm down! How did it happen?""That bastard made a potion that turns fairies into humans! What a plague! How I had not noticed before? He tricked me and now I am ruined!""Is there a way to reverse it?"Maleficent leaned against a tree and answered."Ambrosia. A small piece is enough to give my powers back.""It really exist? I thought it was legend.""It is what we want humans to think. It is not for you.""The ambrosia turns humans into fairies?""It gives immortality and healing for humans, but in my case I will be back to normal."Aurora was happy because it was a hope. But Maleficent wasn't so optimistic."There are only a few pieces worldwide.""Do you know where they are?" The other smiled bitterly."The nearer piece is in your kingdom, hidden in very ancient ruins.""So we have to go there. It's our only hope."She shook her head and said."You are too optimistic. Things are not that easy.""We need to try!"Emma interrupted the conversation very worried."I think we should leave. They must have realized we aren't in the castle and will seek us everywhere!" Aurora agreed."So we have to leave the forbidden lands. It's our only salvation!""Where we go?" Maleficent asked."We have to look for my fairy godmothers! They can help."Upon hearing this, the older woman went away and walked towards the castle. Aurora ran and grabbed her arm."Where are you going?""I am going back to the castle to have that king cut off my head.""You can't be serious!""I would rather die than ask help for those useless fairies!""Oh, please! Is no time for that!"After much persuasion, she convinced Maleficent to go with them. So that no one would recognize her, Aurora aurora took off the leather bands that once covered her horns and she also took out the big cover showing the dress she wore underneath. It was a flashy pink dress, so Aurora tied the cover at some places to turn it into a hooded cloak to cover Maleficent's face."I am ridiculous..." the woman muttered."You are disguised. Now let's go!"They went into the forest trying to get away from there. Go to the village was dangerous because the guards could search them. They needed to go as far as possible. Aurora and Emma had no problems, but Maleficent got tired very easily and they had to stop more often than desired."There are holes in my shoes." She complained examining the shoes, which wasn't made for long walks."I'll settle it." Aurora used the leather bands to wrap Maleficent's feet to protect them. "It'll solve until we get new shoes for you.""And now? Where are we going?" Emma asked looking around."If we continue on this path, we'll leave the forest in two days. It's the shortest and fastest route."They kept the walk until nightfall because Aurora wanted to go as far as possible. Fortunately, Maleficent knew the forest well, which gave them great advantage.When she thought they had gone far enough, Aurora decided it was time to sleep. The guards weren't crazy to walk in that forest at night."What are you doing?" Maleficent asked to see Aurora extending her cloak on the ground beside the fire that Emma had done after gather wood with much difficulty, because it was winter."You need to sleep.""I know, but why are you spreading my cloak on the ground... wait... you do not expect me to sleep on the ground, do you?""So how will you sleep? Standing like a horse?""There may be millions of insects here! They will devour me!""Maleficent, stop this drama! There's not insects in winter, remember? Sleep now."Aurora and Emma took turns to look after the fire while Maleficent tried to sleep. It was a long and difficult night because the former fairy grumbled during half the time and snored during the other half."Wow, does she snore?" Emma asked quietly not to wake her."Usually not, but now she's human. She looks like a pig with asthma!"The two covered their mouths to stifle the laughter. Despite the unusual situation, Aurora couldn't help but wonder how Maleficent was going adapt to her new condition. Without powers, without cedar that casts lightning and without strength. She was just an ordinary human woman and couldn't intimidate people or solve all the problems with magic. Surely it was a totally new situation for her.Lying on her new bed, Helga waited for the maid to serve breakfast feeling like a queen. And acting like a tyrant."Your stupid, I want white bread! You know I hate black bread!" She yelled throwing the tray away. "Look what you did, what crap! Clean it now and bring me a decent food!"The young woman obeyed in silence, fighting back tears. It had been three days Georgei had taken control of the castle and life became hell. He commanded everything like a king and no one had the courage to rebel against someone who was able to defeat Maleficent. Everyone was scared because Georgei always been very intolerant against non-human creatures that inhabited Forbidden Lands. He was very conservative, prejudiced and against religious freedom, women's right and that peasants had access to education. Things was going to be much worse with him in charge.After taking breakfast and change clothes, Helga went to the milliner's room."Did youd finish my dresses?" She asked roughly. It was funny how things could change in a few moments. A week ago, the milliner treated her rudely when she went to clean his room. Then everything changed and now it was she who gave the orders."I finished the green dress you wanted." He replied disheartened. There could be greater misfortune than to be obliged to obey that unpleasant woman?"And the others? I ordered several, your worthless! Do you want me to walk naked through the castle?""No ma'am, of course not, I'm working as fast as possible!""Work even faster! I want all my dresses ready by the end of this week. ALL, understand?"Without waiting for an answer, she went outside with nose up. Despite not being Georgei's wife yet, she saw herself as the owner of that castle and, therefore, could do whatever she wanted. And her first act was to take revenge on everyone who had humiliated and mistreated her in the past. She didn't intend to forgive anyone."A pity that little maid ran away with Aurora and Maleficent..." she lamented, because also wanted to take revenge on Emma. Well... it was only a matter of time until they were found and killed. This satisfied her thirst for revenge very well."We will get to the end of the forest tomorrow around noon." Maleficent said rubbing her feet sore and full of calluses. The walk took longer than expected because she couldn't keep pace with Emma and Aurora."Then we'll rest and look for something to eat." Aurora said.Aurora and Emma lit a fire and and they went looking for something to eat, which wasn't easy. First because it was winter. Second because Maleficent wasn't used to eat berries. When was a fairy, she ate only the best, most delicious and exquisite foods that satisfy her palate.Maleficent sat before the fire, watching the flames that crackled. Be human was the nastiest thing she had experienced in her life. She felt hungry, thirsty, cold, pain, fatigue and her body could get hurt. Not to mention the physiological needs what she was required to do after meals. What a disgusting thing! And shameful as well, since fairies didn't need to go to the bathroom and Aurora had to teach her how to do because she didn't know. It was so humiliating to do those things squatting on the ground! Was necessary to make a great effort not to cry with rage."If things continue like this, I think I am going to kill myself. This is horrible!" She muttered putting a piece of wood on the fire. "Damn, I am hungry again! Are humans always hungry? What the hell!"Being human was unpleasant, but it wasn't her worst concern. Aurora wanted to get the piece of ambrosia to help her. Go to the ancient ruins wasn't exactly a problem, despite several weeks of travel are needed. The problem were the ruins. When hid ambrosia, she also made many traps because wasn't going to let something so valuable within reach of humans. The only way to get in safety was using her magic, which had over.All traps were deadly and no human was able to get even halfway there. She knew the place and traps very well and might have a chance. But such thing was too risky and there was no guarantee of success. She didn't want Aurora to face such danger, but she knew the princess was very stubborn and wouldn't give up easily."I can not and will not let her risk the life for me. No way!" She said firmly. If Aurora's life was the price to get her powers back, so she didn't want. "I need to make her give up. But how?"Before everything collapsed, Emma had told her Aurora thought about leaving the castle. Listen it made her feel very afraid of losing her mate, as she had no courage to keep the princess in the castle by force. Apparently, Aurora was much more hurt than she thought. So at that moment Maleficent had the most painful idea of her life: hurt Aurora to make her give up.That was going to hurt a lot, but there was no other way. She didn't want Aurora to risk her life, so she preferred to make the journey and enter the ruins alone. The princess was going be safer at the palace with her parents. For some time, Aragon wouldn't cause problems, thus she intended try to get the ambrosia and have her powers back. After that, she could regain the Aurora's heart. The most important thing was prevent her to risk her life.Aragon was very angry because his guards didn't find Maleficent and Aurora. What a bunch of incompetents! How they couldn't find three women in the woods?If he wanted to be famous, he had to kill Maleficent and show her head to everyone. And after thinking more calmly, he still wanted to marry Aurora. That woman was a rebel, but he knew how to calm disobedient women. In time, she could become a submissive and obedient wife who was going to give him a heir and the right to take over Stefan's kingdom."Didn't you find them yet?" Georgei asked sitting on the throne with a glass of wine in hand."No. I need proof that I killed Maleficent, or no one will believe me.""I understand. Well, I think I have a solution for this.""Which one?"A servant approached holding Maleficent's scepter."All people know this belongs to Maleficent. It's enough you show this and say you killed her. I can make sure everyone knows that. News travels fast and no one will doubt you."The idea seemed good, but he suspected."It was you who defeated her. Why would you give that glory to me?""Because I did for wealth and power and now I have everything. I don't care about glory.""I understand. But I still have to find Aurora because I need marry her to have the right to the throne of the Stefan's kingdom."Georgei tried to disguise his displeasure because didn't want this man in his kingdom. On the other hand, it was necessary Aragon also reach his goals to leave him alone."Stefan's kingdom... well, it's likely she went to the palace. It's the only safe place she knows.""So far away?""She was able to get here alone, isn't it? Then she can do her way back. That princess is smart like the devil!""Then I'll leave before sunrise! I won't let her escape me!""We're back!" - Aurora announced. "I got a lot of blackberries this time. See how learning to pick berries is helpful?"She sat down and divided the fruits giving a portion to Maleficent, who turned her face to the side grimacing."I do not want eat it.""Oh, no! Not again! C'mon, you need to eat!""These fruits are horrible and I am tired of being human! This miserable existence is not for me!""Look, I know things are bad, but will be better in the future. You need to have faith and believe that everything...""Shut up!" Maleficent shouted. "You are a naive fool who believes in fairy tales! Things are very bad, there is no salvation for me and you are wasting your time!""The time is mine and I spend as I wish! Then I'll help you!"It was necessary to take a deep breath, gather courage and even with heart in pieces, Maleficent looked her with coldness."Who says I need of the help of a skinny, silly and fool princess? I can take care of my problems without you!"Aurora was in shock for a while."Are you crazy? Why are you saying these things?""Because it is true!""I just want to help you!"For a moment, Maleficent wanted stop. But then remembered the terrible traps in the ruins and firmly stood by her decision."I do not need the help of a little princess like you!" she moved away from there and sat away from the campfire. Aurora felt the urge to strangling that ungrateful woman and didn't do it just because Emma calmed her."Have patience, this is all hard for her.""It's been hard for me too! For everyone!"They went to sleep without saying anything and Maleficent stayed up late shivering and thinking of how to act thereafter. She already had a plan and wanted to follow it to the end. It was a very dangerous plan, so she couldn't include Aurora. 

The three fairies looked at the horizon without understand anything. The blizzard, which had started a few minutes ago, disappeared without any logical explanation. This wasn't an isolated event."I know there is something going on, I feel in the air!" Flora said waving her wand."I thought the winter this year would be hard. But it seems that it is getting warmer!" Merryweather also noticed.Fauna looked at the snow that was starting to melt and said."I have not feel any earthquake, storm or hurricane in recent days. What is happening with the world?"Merryweather cheered up a bit."Does Maleficent decided to take a vacation? It would be wonderful if she retires forever! So humans will never have natural disasters!"Flora agreed, but was still confused. Why Maleficent would stop to cause tragedies around the globe? Did Aurora leave her more kind? They always heard that love could change people, but never thought such a thing was possible with Maleficent. Would have Aurora been able to soft her cold and hard heart?After many difficulties, they finally managed to leave the forest. Things between Aurora and Maleficent were getting worse and she couldn't understand why the woman was acting like that. Aurora tried to tell herself it was just a phase, but the way Maleficent treated her was too rude even for the standards of the former fairy."Do you think they'll find us here?" Emma asked."I hope not, we went too far.""This forest is huge and nobody knows it like me." Maleficent said. "They will take many days to realize we are no more in the forest. Now we have to get out of the Forbidden Lands."This was another great challenge, because they were far from the boundary forest. It'd take many days of walking, maybe a month and they couldn't lose so much time. Alone, without supplies and clothing, they ran the risk of dying frozen for the winter. Oscar was getting weak. When trying to wrap up the dragon to protect him from the cold, Aurora had an idea. She reached to Maleficent's castle thanks to the help of a great dragon. Otherwise would have spent many days of walk."A dragon?" Maleficent asked incredulously."Of course! He can take us out of the Forbidden Lands much faster!""Great, genius. And where you intend to find a dragon now? They migrate in winter!"Despite angry with her sarcasm, Aurora kept thinking and remembered that not all dragons migrate in winter."Snow dragons! They shouldn't have migrated with others!"The other rolled her eyes."Even if we find one, which is difficult, how you intend to to make him take us out of the Forbiden Lands? Taming a dragon requires a lot of physical strength and I can not do anything with this useless human body!"Finally, Aurora lost patience. Maleficent was much more annoying than usual."Oh, stop being so pessimistic! We have to try something, anything!""So propose a decent plan, no such idiocies you see in fairy tales!"Emma was worried because when they began discussing that way, Maleficent always said horrible things that made Aurora cry."And do you have any plans by any chance? Till now I have not seen you do anything useful except complain!""You have not done too much except make me walk through a forest during the winter!""I avoided that king cut off your head, remember?"Aurora had finally gotten to the point where Maleficent wanted. Yes, it was going to hurt her too much, but there was no other option. Her safety was more important."To begin with, princess, all this happened because of you!"For a moment she thought heard wrong. Her fault? How?"Exactly! I would have found out that nasty man's plan, but I got distracted because of you and now I am ruined!"See the expression of pure heartbreak and sorrow in the Aurora's face made her throat tighten so that it was necessary to use all her self-control to hold back tears. No, she couldn't falter. More than ever, she had to be strong."I do not know what possessed me to keep you in my castle, you just brought me hassles and never gave me anything good in return!"Oscar and Emma watched everything with wide eyes. Aurora kept hearing all without showing reaction, as if in shock."Because of you, I acted like an idiot and now look at me! You was a mistake in my life, a big mistake and I do not intend to continue making mistakes!""Maleficent, why you...""Shut up! When we leave the Forbidden Lands, you will go to your father's palace and I will go alone! I no longer want you messing up my life.""No... wait, you can't be serious!""You can believe I am dead serious, princess!"The tears falling down Aurora's face from ached her heart. Say those things was very difficult and painful, as it was all a big lie. But it was a necessary lie and there was no way be otherwise.From afar, she saw Aurora sitting on the ground crying desperately and Emma trying comfort her."I hope you can forgive me one day..." she said in a low voice quickly wiping away a tear that was forming in one of her eyes.It was with great relief that Philip stepped ashore a port of Crete. Traveling by ship was one of the worst things that existed. In fact, travel was always very unpleasant. He preferred to be in the comfort of the palace being served."Now I need to find this wizard!" He muttered to himself looking at the map. According to the map, the Wizard lived in a remote and practically deserted area in the middle of the island. Finding it wasn't going be easy, but he hadn't made that long journey to give up early.The night was sad and difficult. Aurora and Emma slept together for warmth, but Maleficent was fighting against the cold alone. She wanted so badly to snuggle with Aurora, hold her very strong and kiss her pretty mouth! How many days have they not exchanged a kiss? Since that fateful night, they even didn't sleep together again. Her only companion was Oscar and she tried to heat him the best way possible."I want you to protect Aurora, little one. She will need you."The dragon looked at her with sadness and she continued."Where I am going is very dangerous, I do not want to risk her life, you understand?"On the horizon, the first rays of the sun emerged and she rose because needed to rush. She ran as fast as her human body allowed until reach a small valley, and there she found what was looking for."Where did she go?""Oh no, she left alone? It's dangerous!" Aurora said very distressed. Alone, Maleficent wouldn't last three full days."She can't have gone far, let's look for her!"A roar echoed through the air and they saw it wasn't necessary to look for Maleficent. A white dragon landed awkwardly near them and on top was the former fairy. Aurora was angry."You had said that my idea is stupid!""I do not want to hear crying and lamentation. Come up immediately! I will not be able to control this dragon for a long time!"They climbed on the back of the dragon and Maleficent ordered roughly."Be useful for something and sing. It will make him docile so I can keep control."It was necessary to a deep breath and hold back the tears to sing something decent to the dragon. Maleficent led him using her cape as makeshift reins and the beast was starting to get agitated and nervous. With aurora's singing, he got calmer and took flight.Driving a dragon was very difficult, even though he was docile thanks Aurora's song. As a fairy, Maleficent was much stronger than any human being. But as a human, her strength has diminished a lot and she struggled to keep the control over the beast. With great difficulty, she managed to make the dragon fly over the forest and reached Stefan's kingdom, where also was winter.They needed find the three fairy godmothers, something that Maleficent didn't want do no way, but it was necessary. They were going to take care of Aurora, allowing her to follow journey alone. Her heart ached more and more knowing her time with Aurora was running out.Merryweather was using her wand to clear the snow that covered the yard when began to scream hysterically, calling the other fairies."Oh, a dragon! A huge dragon is coming here!""A dragon? Here? What is happening?" Flora asked terrified at the great beast landing in the yard, more specifically where was her tulips. But he didn't seem hostile and they soon saw three people mounted on his back.Two women were unknown, but they soon recognized Aurora despite her appearance."Aurora, what happened to you?""Oh, no! Are you sick?"They talked at the same time and Aurora tried to calm them to explain the situation."A terrible thing happened and we need your help!""Yes, dear, but you need to come in, it is cold. Who are your friends?" Fauna asked looking at Emma and then to another woman that removed the reins of the dragon for him to go away.There was something very familiar about that woman, especially her green eyes and that unpleasant frown."Maleficent!" they exclaimed at the same time totally disbelieving at her appearance. Her clothes were dirty, torn, she no longer had her big cover nor the horns and her hair was a mess. The more strange, however, was her appearance so human and ordinary."I thought you were never find out!" She muttered trying to keep her dignity despite feeling humiliated. Could there be a greater punishment than being seen like that way by those meddlesome fairies?Finished the initial shock, they entered the cabin and Fauna filled the table with food and good mugs with hot milk. Aurora, Emma and Oscar ate unceremoniously, but Maleficent didn't touch the food. For now, her pride was greater than her hunger."What happened to you?" Flora asked.Between a bite and another, Aurora explained everything that had happened in the castle and fairies were horrified because knew such enchantment and feared it."I thought this spell was gone!" Merryweather said confused."Me too. All scrolls were burned, but humans managed to save something. That bastard should have researched and discovered how to make the potion. Now, I am ruined and there is only one hope for me. ""Ambrosia is not it?" Flora guessed. "Do you know where to find?""Yes, it is in a place that I made.""Can you help us?" Aurora asked. "Alone, we would take months to get to these ruins!"Help Maleficent? Had they heard correctly? Flora shook her head."Why would we do that? The world will be much better without chaos and natural disasters!""That is right!" Merryweather agreed. "She only knows cause tragedies and misfortunes for humans! I do not know who this Georgei is, but he did a great favor to everyone!""You can't be serious! Look how she is and...""Enough!" Maleficent said brusquely. "I did not come here to ask help for these worthless. My goal is just leave you with them and go away alone."Aurora stood up indignantly."Stop it, you won't go away alone!""I gave my final word princess! They will lead you to the your father's palace. I do not want to discuss it!"Fauna, which until then watched the discussion in silence, tried to calm them."You are exhausted. I will arrange for you a bath and clean clothes.""Do it for them, I am leaving." Fauna protested."No you are not!" She ignored the grimaces from the other two and continued. "What do you hope to gain leaving now? It is too cold and you can die frozen. Do not forget you are human."Maleficent snorted, but couldn't argue. Well... she was at rock bottom, so didn't make much difference accept a little charity from the fairies. Things couldn't get any worse.They bathed and Flora took care of Aurora, who still had patches on the skin due to allergy. Maleficent was in a bedroom that fairies had arranged to host them and thought about what to do from then on. She knew Aurora was safe and the fairies was going to take her to the palace. Her heart ached to know the separation could be definitive. Being human, she ran the risk to die trying get the ambrosia."No... I can not die!" She thought clenching her fists in anger. Aragon was a major threat to the kingdom and Aurora. If she didn't want to marry him, could be killed without any mercy. No way she would let Aurora suffer. There was also Georgei who became a great danger to anyone who didn't agree with his retrograde ideas. And finally, a much larger threat that needed to be contained before it was too late.Aurora and Emma entered the bedroom, interrupting her thoughts. Before Aurora talk again insisting on going with her, Maleficent came out quickly and went to the balcony of the house, ignoring the cold and snow. She needed to organize the thoughts."Do not be so sad, darling! She is not worth it!" Flora said trying to comfort the princess. Merryweather agreed."She is not able to love anyone and you should know that! Now do not be afraid, tomorrow we will take you to the palace and everything will be fine!""No way! I'm going with her!"(Flora) "But she does not want you to go with her!""I'm going anyway!"(Merryweather) "She is too proud and stubborn to accept that needs help, then let her go alone, it is not your problem!""Why don't you want to help her?"Flora answered."Because she causes chaos and tragedies over the world! Without her, humans will no longer suffer!""You don't know what are talking about! Chaos is needed!"(Merryweather) "Necessary for whom? This only brings pain and suffering!""Chaos renews, revitalizes! She told me that everything that exists now came the chaos and..." Flora interrupted."The chaos may have been required to get everything started, but now is not necessary anymore and only brings more suffering! I am sorry child, but I do not want to help someone who brings pain and suffering to the humans.""That is right!" Merryweather also said. "Tomorrow, if she wants go away, we let her go. You will be taken back to the palace and live with your parents, as it should be!"It was worthless to Aurora argue and protest. Merryweather and Flora remained adamant. Tired and emotionally drained, she just tried sleep hoping to convince the fairies the next day."I want to be alone, if you do not mind." Maleficent said unwillingly when Fauna went to the balcony carrying a wool blanket. "I do not need your charity.""Proud as always! To some extent, a bit of pride is good. But everything has a limit and you can not have this luxury now."Her body was shivering and she tapped her chin, so took the blanket that Fauna offered."Tomorrow we will think of a way to help you get the ambrosia.""I do not need anyone's help!""Not Aurora's?""Especially this useless, foolish and dumb princess!"The green fairy gave an indulgent smile and said in a soft voice."Do you know what is the problem with always being honest all the time?" Maleficent just looked without understanding the meaning of this question. Fauna completed. "It makes you a terrible liar. You may have fooled Aurora and the other fairies, but I know you are not being sincere."She gritted the teeth cursing that meddlesome fairy in thought. It was so obvious?"I do not know what you are talking about." She still tried to dodge. It didn't work."Answer me: it was you who hid the ambrosia, was not it?""Yes, I did.""And surely put many traps. Do not look at me like that! I know you would never let something so valuable within reach of humans.""Of course not! I am not stupid!""And that is why you do not want Aurora to go with you."Maleficent turned her face to the other side feeling very embarrassed by that fairy have discovered so easily."How long you think you can fool Aurora? Remember she was able to get to your castle virtually alone and free her parents. She will figure out your intentions and go behind you.""I do not want it to happen no way!" She talked a little more loudly and soon lowered the tone. "The traps that I did are very dangerous. Dozens of humans were killed before they reached the halfway point.""Yet you want to risk.""I made those traps and can find a way to get through them without dying. But there are no guarantees and I do not want to risk Aurora's life."Fauna thought a bit and said again."So you would rather hurt her than risk her life?""One day she will understand.""There is a possibility you will lose her forever."After a discreet sigh, she countered."I take the risk, but I will not let her put her life in danger for me.""So you are willing to give her up and release her?""Yes, I am. If this is for her safety, I will do it without hesitation."A smile appeared on the lips of the Green Fairy."So you love her!" She ignored the Maleficent's scowl and continued. "You really love her!""That is none of your business and I tolerated your presence too long!" She said trying to finish that embarrassing subject. If she didn't talk about her feelings to Aurora, no way would do this with one of those meddlesome fairies."You need not speak. Just listen."Ignoring the unwillingness of former fairy, Fauna said."I always thought you were not able to feel love. I was wrong. You do not know much about love, but know enough to put the Aurora's welfare above your wishes."Maleficent kept silent, trying to save her dignity."You know... love is also hear the loved one and respected her will. I know you want to protect Aurora, but also need to take into consideration what she wants to do. Her life belongs to her, never forget that.""I am not going to risk her life!" She said impatiently."This decision is not yours, Maleficent. I think it is time to you respect Aurora as a person with her own will. Let her decide for herself and respect her decision.""Even if it puts her life in danger?""Everybody is free to follow their way. It is called free will. Even though she makes mistakes, we can not interfere in her right to choose.""And if she wants to go with me? It is dangerous!""Aurora is not as weak as she seems. Remember that it was thanks to her you are here!""Do not remind me of that!" She muttered."Our princess is strong, courageous and determined. And she loves you very much, to the point to abandon her parents and kingdom to be with you!"She swallowed loudly and turned back to the other side."I do not know why fate united you, but I know that is how it should be. You must be together in good and bad times.""It makes no sense!""Love does not make sense most of the time. Get used to it. Talk to Aurora. I know it is hard for you, but try to make an effort. She deserves it."She went back into the cabin leaving Maleficent alone with her thoughts. A few minutes later, she also entered and went to the bedroom where Emma and Aurora slept. Fauna's words still echoed in her head and she knew it was necessary to make an important decision. Perhaps the hardest of her life. 

Two days later Maleficent hasn't left yet because Fauna insisted to they stay for a while longer. Host Aurora and Emma wasn't problem for the other two fairies, but living under the same roof as Maleficent was very unpleasant for them. And the former fairy was also not liking one bit of it.Aurora and Emma had gone out for a walk and pick up firewood, since the cold wasn't so strong and wasn't snowing. Maleficent was in the middle of the yard sitting on a stone lost in her thoughts. She hadn't yet decided whether or not talking to Aurora and tell the truth. See the princess so hurt broke her heart, but she didn't want to put her life in danger. No, Aurora had suffered too much. It wasn't fair to make her suffer more and even lose her life."Everybody is free to follow their way. It is called free will. Even though she makes mistakes, we can not interfere in her right to choose."She remembered what Fauna had said. That was true and she knew very well. For a long time she didn't respect Aurora's right of choice. She always took decisions ignoring if the princess agreed or not. But that wasn't right. Aurora was her half, then should be treated as equal. Of course her dominant and proud personality didn't accept to see another person as an equal, but she needed to give in at this point if wanted to have any chance of being happy with Aurora."Goddess, why is this so complicated?" She wondered aloud. The green fairy was right. Love didn't make sense most of the time. It was so illogical and irrational! And at the same time clear and transparent as water.Maleficent wanted Aurora to go with her because she was her half and love. If they work together, the chances would be higher. And Aurora wanted to go with her. It was right disrespect her choice just to satisfy a selfish desire to keep her safe? Maybe it was time to change some things. As much as it hurt her ego, Maleficent decided talk to Aurora and respect her choice. And most importantly: fight for her love and for things to be fine between them again."I will talk to her today." She said decided. No use run away or postpone. It was necessary to face the problem squarely and fight. She never ran, never backed down and that wasn't going to be the first time. She was Maleficent and had to respect her name."I do not know why you insist on keeping her with us!" Flora said visibly grumpy. Merryweather agreed."That ungrateful can not even say a simple 'thanks', why should we help her?""For Aurora." Fauna responded with all patience. "You know she loves her."(Merryweather) "I do not know how can be possible to love someone like Maleficent. She is the most terrible creature that exists!"(Fauna) "Aurora does not see that way and I trust her judgment."(Flora) "Anyway, they quarreled. Surely it is Maleficent's fault, as always. It is impossible to live with her!"(Fauna) "This will be resolved soon, do not worry."Rather than reassure, it left them terrified."That would be a disaster! If they make up, Aurora will depart with her! We can not let it happen and...""Enough!" Fauna said severely, causing Marryweather shut up. "Many things went wrong because we interfere in their fate. I do not intend to interfere anymore and will not let you do the same. This conversation is over!"She went away leaving both speechless. It was the first time the always patient and quiet Fauna raised the voice and talk that way.When they came back to fairies' house, they saw someone waiting outside the property. Aurora just looked at her without talk nothing."I'll take this." Emma said taking firewood from Aurora's arms and leaving them alone.Maleficent looked Aurora unsure how to start the conversation and the princess saw she was with the same eyes when she looks for her after a quarrel to make amends."It is not very cold now, I think we can talk somewhere else, if you do not mind. I do not want those meddlesome fairies listening our conversation."Aurora agreed and they left to walk nearby the property, without straying too far. After a few minutes of hesitation, choosing the words carefully, Maleficent began."It was not your fault.""What?" The woman took a deep breath and explained."When you told me that bastard was burying silver spoons near the century-old tree, I should have figured it out, but I underestimated the situation.""I distracted you...""I could have discovered before. Do not feel guilty. I take responsibility."They were silent again and Aurora wondered if that was the closest to an apology that Maleficent could do. The former fairy spoke again."The place where I hid the ambrosia is very dangerous and full of traps I made by myself.""Traps?" She finally understood it all. "So that's why you were mistreating me this whole time? To prevent me from going with you?""Yes. This trip will be very dangerous and I do not want risk your life."Aurora stopped walking and tapped a foot on the ground, talking angrily."You have no right to decide for me!""I know." she replied leaving the blonder unresponsive. "But I wanted to protect you. All this happened because of me, then I must bear the consequences alone. You do not deserve to suffer even more because of my carelessness.""Maleficent... you're really an idiot! Did you think I'd give up that easy and leave you in this time of crisis? Never!""Foolish princess!" She muttered with red face."I'll go with you anyway and don't try to stop me! If we work together, I'm sure we'll make it!""You are no longer my prisoner and can go back to your parents if you want""That's why I want to go with you! Because I am free and can do whatever I want with my life!""That makes no sense. Why are humans so confused?" she asked disguising her embarrassment."Well... you're human now. Will soon discover.""Do not remind me, your foolish! I can not wait to get back to what I was before!"She laughed ignoring the scowl of the older woman."So we have to prepare for the trip, we can't waste time!"She was going back to the cabin when felt a hand holding her wrist strongly. Maleficent pulled her body near to hers and kissed her lips hungrily. It was the first kiss after several days and Aurora kissed back hugging her tightly. Her taste hasn't changed after she turned into a human.Flora and Merryweather didn't hide their displeasure when saw Maleficent and Aurora holding hands and smiling at each other. Why Aurora's hair and dress were dirt with snow and dry leaves? Why their faces were so flushed? What they had done in the forest? Indecency! Fauna just giggled to see they had made amends."Look," the princess began. "Maleficent and I talked a lot and...""You talked... I know..." Merryweather said slyly looking at Maleficent, who returned her best scowl. Aurora continued."I'll go with her.""What?" Two fairies exclaimed incredulously. Fauna wasn't impressed, as expected this."I'll go with her because together we'll have more chances of getting ambrosia.""You will risk Aurora's life to benefit yourself!" Flora said very indignant to Maleficent."No! I'll go because I want! Maleficent doesn't want me to go and risk my life, but this is my decision and no one else!""But...""If you decided, then we will respect, dear." Fauna said quietly. "How can we help you?"Flora and Merryweather protested."Help her? No way! We will not help Maleficent bring chaos and suffering to the world again!" Flora said very decided."Exactly! The world is much better off without her! We will leave things as they are! Finally the earth will be a paradise for everyone!"Aurora opened her mouth to argue when heard a cynical laugh echoing through the room. Maleficent laughed evilly, as only she could do."A paradise for everyone? Really? You do not know what are talking about!""What did you say?" the fairies asked at the same time."If you think the world will be better off without me, then you are stupid and do not know anything!""Maleficent, what do you mean by that?" Aurora asked.She went to the window, looked at the landscape seeing the snow that began to melt and turned to women who were eagerly waiting for the answer."I am the chaos, destruction and death. At least I was before this disaster happens.""That is why we do not want help you!" Merryweather interrupted. Maleficent ignored and continued."Nature is constantly moving. For new things to come, the old ones need do be destroyed. It is how nature is renewed and the cycle of destruction and creation can not be stopped."The three fairies listened in silent, feeling a very big discomfort. It wasn't necessary be a genius to understand what Maleficent wanted say."Without destruction, nature will no longer be renewed. Everything that exists will grow old, rot and finally die because there is no more chaos to destroy and renew. Do you think I am a pest and the world will be better off without me? Then think again, because without my intervention all that exists will rot slowly until die!"Aurora swallowed loudly and the fairies were in complete shock. They knew the former fairy telling the truth. Perhaps, deep down, they always knew it, but tried to ignore. The world needed Maleficent to bring chaos, because birth and renewal could only come after the destruction and death of the old one.Feeling totally defeated, and with nowhere to escape, Flora approached Maleficent and said wearily."Very well. What do you need? Tell us and we will help in any way possible."The fairies had gone out to provide essential items for the trip of Maleficent, Aurora and Emma, who decided to go with them. Maleficent was sitting on the porch looking at the landscape. The snow was melting earlier than it should because the whole weather was unbalanced."Should snow be melting now?" Aurora asked sitting next to her."No. It is happening because the balance was affected. The earth needs the winter to rest.""Then everything will die if chaos doesn't come back?""Yes. Within a few decades, or so, life on the planet will become increasingly harder until all die someday. The nature needs to be renewed constantly to keep existing. I have told you about it several times."Aurora looked at the landscape for a while and said."You didn't tell me specifically that.""That what?""The world might end if you don't regain your powers. Why didn't you tell me the truth?"The woman was silent again and Aurora insisted."You had enough time to tell me the truth, why omit it?""I do not want you to go because it is dangerous and...""Maleficent, stop! You have no talent for lying. And don't do this frown to me!"Seeing that had no choice, she gave up and told the truth."Even having decided I was going to leave you behind, I wanted to make sure that you would go with me for me, not only to save the world.""Your stupid! Of course I'm going for you! But I can go to save the world too. One doesn't exclude the other!""But did not know and wanted to make sure."She shook her head, understanding Maleficent's reasons."You don't trust what I feel for you, isn't it?"No answer. Maleficent didn't like to talk about those things and wasn't at the will."I asked you a question, but I think you needn't answer." After a few seconds of silence, trying to keep calm, Aurora spoke again. "Maleficent, listen to me. What happened a few days ago was because you don't trust me.""You are saying nonsense!""No, I'm not! You didn't trust my feeling before and don't trust now! How we'll overcome this crisis if you can't trust me?"Maleficent couldn't look at the princess's eyes. She just said."I promise to compensate you in the future. And you can be sure that it will never be repeated again, you need not be afraid. I have many faults, but always keep my promises."Aurora held one of her hands, speaking softly."I know and trust you, Maleficent. And you don't have to make it up to me, I just want two things from you.""What things?""Trust and respect. I want you to trust me and know I'll never betray you. It's a promise and you know I always keep my promises. If I'm with you, is because I love you! Otherwise, I'd have gone."She spoke with a trembling voice and tears forming in her eyes. Maleficent didn't thrilled with the great tragedies or with the death of hundreds of people. But her heart softened at once when saw tears in the eyes of her princess. She stroked her face softly, wiping her tears."I know...""So trust me! And respect me too! I know you meant no harm, but during the time I was in the castle, you have managed my life and treated me like your property. I don't want this anymore."She looked to the other side and looked back at Aurora, knowing that that matter was serious. As much as she hated to admit it, the princess was right."If we're going to be together, I want equality. I'm willing to accept the way you are, with qualities and defects. But I want you to respect me."It seemed like a simple request, but for someone like Maleficent was very hard to see someone else, especially a human, as an equal. She needed time to get used to that idea, but was willing to give in for Aurora. She was her half and halves were equal, otherwise wouldn't be halves."You know me and understand how all this is new to me. I promise to do it, but I need you to be patient and respect my time." The younger woman smiled and moved closer to her, putting the head on her shoulder."I couldn't be with you if I had no patience, right?""Foolish princess!" the other grumbled tightening the blond most to her."We'll have many difficulties, then we must be united. Only then we'll overcome this crisis and be fine. And when this is over, what will you do with Georgei and who helped him?"For the first time in many days, Maleficent smiled broadly."Unimaginable tortures, you can wait! When I am done with that bastard, he will be begging for death, but I will have no mercy!"That kind of thing was very cruel and macabre to her sensitivity, but Aurora knew that was Maleficent's way to be. Still, it was hard to get used.After counting the gold coins and make various calculations, Georgei saw the amount was enough to keep the castle and its employees for two months if he were more economical. He intended to cut some expenses like the food for maids and servants because it was absurd they eat the same things as the nobles of the court. It was necessary to take extreme measures until find Maleficent's treasure, which wasn't being even a little easier. Where that miserable fairy hid the gold?He thought it was enough defeat her to have access to all her treasures. However, several problems have arisen. Fairy's laboratory was closed and sealed. To enter, it was necessary to know the correct order of a series of strange symbols that he didn't understand. And without access to the laboratory, he also had no access to her secrets. Maleficent's bedroom revealed nothing. Despite all the luxury and extravagance, it was just her bedroom and had nothing important.And to increase his problems, the subjects could rebel at any time. Initially everyone was afraid of the man who defeated Maleficent, but it was only a matter of time until everyone realizes he was just a common man and had no power. For while the guards kept order, but no one was enjoying his style of leadership and he didn't understand why, as he was just doing things the right way as they should be. People were wrong to disagree with him. That was why he needed to find Maleficent's treasure. The money always opened doors and bought people. With enough gold, he could have a good army and protection. So he'd be free to rule the Forbidden Lands the way he wanted and put an end to those abominations that Maleficent allowed to live in those lands. His first step was to call the Inquisition to burn all those demonic creatures at the stake."I need to find the treasure, but how? I have no idea where it is!" The man walked one side to another trying to think of something. He tried to search for these symbols and found nothing. Only Maleficent knew the correct combination. And also Aurora, for all he knew. But they were lost, perhaps dead.Or not?"This princess is smart as the devil and might have survived!" He said to himself. "If she is alive, then Maleficent is also and if I could find them, I can get the password to enter the laboratory!" He ran to the bookshelf, where there were many books and scrolls. If his memory wasn't wrong, there was a way to find Aurora and Maleficent. It was his best chance.Everything was ready for the trip. The fairies have provided clothes, outerwear, money for emergencies, bandages for dressings, medicines and even some knives for protection. They also brought three strong and healthy horses able to endure long walks."Put a drop of this liquid into the mouths of horses every day." Flora taught giving to Aurora a small bottle with a pink liquid. "It will keep them strong, healthy and able to withstand many days without food and water.""Thank you, it helps a lot! And please take care of my parents!""We will do that, dear."After change the clothes, Maleficent was out of the cabin. She, like Aurora and Emma, was wearing a simple brown sleeveless tunic secured to the body by a leather belt. Underneath, a long-sleeved blouse made of raw cotton. She also wore leather boots and the tunic was comfortable for them to ride. It was an ordinary outfit that any peasant would wear so they could travel without attracting too much unwanted attention."I am ready. Can we go?""Of course. Here is your horse.""Horse?"She looked at the horse, which looked her back showing unwillingness to carry her on his back."I will not ride this animal!""Yes you will, Maleficent! Or would you rather to walk?"She looked again at the horse, which whinnied nervously, and felt great disgust. The animal had a somewhat bad smell and didn't seem very clean. Well... she had no choice. Walk wasn't option.Aurora and Emma were saying goodbye to fairies while she waited impatiently. Why so much sentimentality? They weren't saying goodbye forever, unfortunately. How much drama!"Thanks for all you have done for us, thank you!" Aurora thanked tearfully."It was a pleasure to meet you, I thank you for helping us!" Emma also talked thrilled."You are welcome, dear! Come visit us one day, if 'certain' person allows." Merryweather said venomously casting a defiant look for Maleficent, who made her traditional scowl and turned her face to the other side. Aurora held her hand and asked."Won't you say thanks, Maleficent?""What are you talking about?""They did a lot for us. It's time to thank. Now!"The fairies looked expectantly to Maleficent and she writhed in anger at the expression of victory in the damn blue fairy's face."We have to hurry because..." Aurora put her hands on hips and when that happened, Maleficent knew it was useless to argue. They only were going get out of there when she thanked those meddlesome fairies. Oh, no…Seeing that she had no alternative, Maleficent turned to fairies, took a deep breath, swallowed loudly, opened and closed the mouth a few times, rubbed her neck with one hand and dragged one foot on the ground, swallowed again, coughed, choked, took a breath and tried to say something. Her lips twitched a few times, as they refused to say that word."C'mon, Maleficent, you can!" Aurora encouraged trying to not to laugh.The former fairy trembled, sweated cold, stuttered several times and tried to speak."Than... than... than..." Finally, Aurora slapped her on the back and it made her spit at once the so difficult and complicated words. "Thank you! Heavens... I will die!"Merryweather laughed with satisfaction while Flora and Fauna tried to keep serious. Aurora held Maleficent's hand to calm her."It's all right, I'm proud of you. Calm down... the first time it hurts, but then you get used. ""Can we go now? Or do you want me to hug each one and give a kiss on their faces?"Merryweather startled and said indignantly."No chance! Go away now, you have a long walk ahead. Go! Go! Go!"But the torture wasn't over yet. Aurora and Emma had to help Maleficent to ride the horse, something she had never done before because could go from one place to another in the world instantly.The first attempt was a failure because she rode the horse backwards. Merryweather laughed, overjoyed to see her traditional enemy suffering with such embarrassing situation. After much struggle, she finally rode towards the right direction and begun the journey."I can't believe you don't know how to ride a horse!" Aurora said when they reached the road."Why should I know? I never needed. Ouch, this saddle is too hard! My buttocks is starting to hurt! This animal stinks and shakes a lot! I hope it does not have fleas and ticks, it is very disgusting! What if it bites me? I am going to die infected!"Aurora and Emma needed to take a deep breath to withstand Maleficent's grumbling. Her body has changed, but her difficult personality was exactly the same. That journey promised to be long and hard... 

It had been many days that Aurora hadn't visited them and gave no news, leaving Stefan and Leah very worried. In recent months, Aurora visited them regularly and also sent letters, leaving the couple relieved to know their daughter was fine despite living with Maleficent. However, the letters and visits ceased completely, leaving them apprehensive.Did Maleficent arrest Aurora in the dungeon? Would have killed her? Forbidden to visit them or send letters? They expected anything of that creature. And the worries didn't stop increasing, since the fairies had also disappeared and they didn't know how to call them. They came when wanted."I am so worried! What happened to Aurora?" Leah asked feeling very tired, wondering when this torment was going to end."Now I do not know anything else, my wife. I do not trust Maleficent and I fear she is doing many atrocities with Aurora. And we can not do anything!""Oh, heavens! My delicate and helpless little girl!"They lamented Aurora's bad luck, which was subject to the whims of a evil fairy. There couldn't be worse fate than this and they wondered what kind of atrocities Maleficent was doing at that moment.Emma grabbed Oscar and ran out of the barn leaving Aurora alone with Maleficent, who was uncontrolled."Maleficent, stop it! Are you crazy?"The woman screamed and pounded frantically on the ground with a stick and only stopped because was overcome with fatigue. Only then Emma and Oscar could come again."Disgusting creature! Infamous! Repulsive! When I regain my powers, I will do this monster disappears from the face of the Earth forever!" She said with wide eyes and her body shook like a leaf tossed by the wind.Aurora shook her head, trying to keep her patience."Please, this whole scandal because of a cockroach?""It is not a cockroach, is a monster! Did you see the size of that thing? I thought it was about to devour me!"It was night and they entered that abandoned barn to sleep in safety. Everything seemed quiet when a cockroach climbed into Maleficent's arm and she started a festival of screaming and cursing while chasing the little insect throughout the barn hitting the ground with a stick."I didn't know you have afraid of cockroaches!" Emma said trying to contain her laughter."I am not afraid, just disgusted! These insects transmit diseases.""That's right, release this stick and try to sleep. We have a long day of riding tomorrow and need some rest."After ensuring there was no cockroaches around, Maleficent snuggled with Aurora and fell asleep without snoring for the other two women's relief. Apparently, she only snored when slept without Aurora.It had been about two weeks since they left fairies' house and things were far from easy. When they were on the road, the trip wasn't so difficult. But things always got worse when they reached a village and needed to interact with the villagers. Maleficent, with her difficult temper, didn't know be gentle and friendly and constantly caused problems for the other two women.Words like "please", "thank you", "sorry" and "excuse me" weren't part of her usual vocabulary. She was always rude with people and they often had to sleep outdoors because her coarse manners prevented them from get hosting in someone's home.Aurora hoped Maleficent to learn to be more humble with time, but the former fairy was more stubborn than she imagined. Probably she as never going to change."Do something, you idiots! The horses are running away!" Aragon screamed desperate to see his horses fled in disarray for the third time. The guards chased the horses until they fall exhausted. It was useless, since the animals ran much faster than them.Seeing his guards crawling back without the horses, Aragon sat on the ground too tired to scream and curse. For the first time, he wondered if that plan had been a good idea. Well... it all seemed so simple and couldn't go wrong. But things have failed miserably and he couldn't defeat Maleficent nor rescue Aurora to make her his wife.And when was trying go back to his kingdom, things were going wrong as if the universe was conspiring against him. First was a widespread crisis of itching as if they had dipped into a pool full of nettles. After the horses fled for no apparent reason, leaving them stranded in the middle of the road far away from the nearest village. His gold coins were ending slowly, preventing him from buying other horses.With no other alternative, they began the long walk, hoping to find a village as soon as possible. He had to return to his kingdom, rest and only then look for Stefan and demand Aurora's hand in marriage. Otherwise, the war would be declared.Flora, Fauna and Merryweather watched the group leaving, happy to have been able to slow them down once again. When Aurora was distracted with preparations for the trip, Maleficent talked about Aragon and asked them to delay him the utmost. This was going to give time for them reach the ambrosia. And the fairies were succeeding in their mission."I hope Maleficent find the ambrosia soon, we can not do this forever." Flora said worriedly, as they couldn't use brute force or hurt humans."Well... she always gets what she wants." Fauna said. Merryweather wasn't so optimistic."When she was the most powerful fairy of Earth, yes. Now she is just human and I am afraid that things go wrong. The worst is Aurora being hurt or... oh, I can not think about this!""So do not think. Believe." Fauna said calmly. "And we will keep an eye on that king and his guards. The more we can slow them down, the better. "The fairies continued to follow the group, doing everything to delay their walk.Georgei was very frustrated. What good was to see those women and not being able to hear them? It was clear they were planning something. That journey had a goal he didn't know. Despite having some knowledge of magic, he wasn't a magician of birth and this brought him many hardships. He managed to find them, but couldn't hear what they said. It was necessary to improve the enchantment.In Maleficent's bedroom, he had placed a small pot in front of the large mirror where some herbs, stones, pieces of animals and insects cooked slowly and the smoke caused the mirror to show what he wanted to see."Let's see... I need beaks of ten parrots, this will make the mirror emits sounds. Just so I can know what they are plotting!"He also needed to find out where they were and how to achieve them. His plan was to arrest Aurora and compel Maleficent to reveal the location of her secret treasure. If she refused to speak, the princess was dead. Anyway, he intended to kill them, but the idiot former fairy didn't need to know that.Philip sat on a rock, took several deep breaths and finally gathered the courage to start walking. The place was cold, desert, desolate and full of rocks, boulders and gravel, with a few plants here and there. Who in his right mind would dare to live in that end of the world? In his hands, he took the map that was the only guide in that unknown country.He also had bought a horse and a pack mule to carry his supplies, because that trip could last many days, perhaps weeks."I have no choice. The faster I go, the faster I return to my kingdom." He spoke aloud, since nobody was listening beyond the horse and the mule. And his concerns were justified because if his absence last a long time, the subjects could think he had given up the throne and fled, something he never wanted to do because he had no intention of leaving his life full of luxury and comfort to work to provide for himself. And there was also the danger of Aragon to invade his kingdom, which he also wanted to avoid because he wanted to keep his head on top of the neck rather than rolling on the ground.His only hope was that wizard be able to defeat Maleficent. What if he didn't want help? What if he wasn't able to defeat her? What..."No! I won't think about these things!" The man said shaking his head push away those negative thoughts. Pessimism never led anyone to the top."I can't believe you let the food burn again!" Aurora scolded to see Maleficent had burned that night's dinner."Stop bothering me, it is not so bad!""Not so bad? It looks like coal!"They began the thousandth quarrel. How someone was able to prepare all kinds of potions and didn't know how to cook? Aurora tried to teach her, but Maleficent's culinary expertise was nonexistent. She knew only to eat, not to cook. Once, when Emma caught some fish, the former fairy baked them without clear, without even to remove the scales. Another time, she put some herbs with unpleasant taste in porridge because it was good for health, but abysmal for the palate.She also mixed dried fruits in the soup of meat and vegetables, cooked potatoes without peeling and her scrambled eggs had pieces of eggshell. All right, that was the last time Aurora left Maleficent to cook. She had no talent for it and they couldn't waste food."This ground is too hard!" The woman complained again."Well... we could be sleeping in a better place if you hadn't been rude to the owner of that inn! He was even willing to give us food!""He wanted you to sing for that bunch of drunks! I will not allow it!""It's my body, I do what I want! There is nothing wrong in singing, I would never let anyone lay a hand on me!""But they would do anyway! They are a filthy pig and the owner of that Inn is the worst of all!""You shouldn't have said that to him!""I just told the truth!"So were their days. Often Maleficent forgotten she had no powers anymore and made several problems which couldn't solve. It was necessary for Aurora and Emma interfere to prevent a tragedy. The situation was very difficult and she did nothing to make things better.Irritated and stressed with difficult temperament of the former Fairy, Aurora slept away from her and refused her proximity. It was time for Maleficent to learn to behave decently. 

The scenery was horrible. There was a lot of trash on the streets, the houses were poor, badly built and people looked very sick."Maleficent, what's happening to these people?" Aurora asked worried about the appearance of the villagers. "What are those black spots on their skin?""Black Plague." she answered very worried. "We have to leave this village immediately or we will die infected.""These people need help..." Aurora said feeling her heart breaking to see so much suffering. She had never seen anything like it."We must continue."The princess was angry. Even though she became human, Maleficent seemed unable to feel any empathy or compassion for the suffering of people. She didn't care to see people going hungry, cold, sick or miserable. Every village they visited, Aurora resented increasingly with so coldly and she was reaching her limit and could no longer tolerate it."People are suffering and you only think about yourself? This is horrible! ""Believe me, we can not help them now. Our best chance is the ambrosia and...""You selfish! You are very selfish and you don't think about anyone!" Aurora cried and dismounted. Maleficent could wait, but she didn't intend to leave those poor people without help.Emma wanted to go after her and the former fairy ordered."Stay here and do not touch anyone. I will go after her."When Aurora wanted to touch a child who was infected, Maleficent held her hand firmly."Aurora, listen to me!""I don't have to listen to you!""Yes, you have your foolish! Come now!" She dragged the princess to near the horses and spoke with energetic voice holding her shoulders. "Listen to me very well! This disease is transmitted by rats. They are breeding too fast because the temperature is rising.""So we have to stop the rats!" She said in panic."I can do this by bringing winter back. All rats will die and this will give the villagers time to recover. Later, your father can take steps to prevent the proliferation of these rats.""But for that we need to regain your powers and..." she stopped, realizing what the former fairy wanted to say."Exactly. If we stay here, we will contract the disease and we will not can help anyone. The best chance of these people are we be successful in our pursuit.""It's so painful to see them suffer...""You need be strong.""How can you? How do you can see these people suffer and feel nothing? Doesn't it let you sad?"Maleficent was silent, still holding her shoulders. Aurora became enraged and pushed her hard."You really don't care about anyone! How can you be so? This is horrible! I don't understand how can you sleep every night."The former fairy looked down for a few seconds and then spoke as if nothing had happened."We need to go. Waste time in lamentations is useless."They rode their horses and drove on. Aurora struggled in vain to hold back tears. She had never seen so much pain and suffering in her life and couldn't understand how Maleficent could be indifferent to everything. Despite understanding her faults and be willing to accept her way of being, she didn't know if could live with a person who felt no compassion for anyone.Maleficent surreptitiously watched the princess and knew how much she was upset with her attitude. A great feeling of sadness invaded her chest, making the heart ache. It was clear that Aurora didn't accept her as she was. And in part the princess was right. Throughout her life she had dreamed of a kind of love. Perfect, ideal and free of trouble and sorrow. But all she had was a temperamental, jealous and domineering fairy who only showed affection with sex and gifts, but was unable to say a simple "I love you.".No way she fit in the kind of love which Aurora dreamed and it made her sad. Why the princess still cared to help her? Why did she accept to continue?"She is distraught about all this." She thought trying to justify Aurora's actions. "I can not take what she said seriously." Still she was afraid that one day the princess would get tired of her. Until then she had been patient, but there was a limit to everything. It must be very difficult for a young woman with a so sensitive and kind heart to live with someone like her.On the other hand, she didn't understand why should feel empathy or compassion for humans. Sure, she had become human, so was learning to understand their difficulties. But what was the use in feel empathy for people who were suffering? Humans breed almost as fast as rats. If one died, ten were born in its place. Humans were going to be extinct in the very distant future. Although this was her job, as it had been in the past, they were most likely to do it by themselves. Why should she care about creatures that didn't have compassion for their own kind? She has always been careful to prevent natural tragedies from reaching enormous proportions to the point of destroying all life on the planet. Shouldn't that be enough? Apparently it wasn't. Maleficent often didn't worry when an earthquake, flood, or hurricane was stronger than it should and caused so much calamity for the humans. For her, it was enough not to destroy the planet.Aurora never tried to interfere with her actions, but she was often saddened by the misery caused to humans. Before, she thought the princess was overreacting. After that discussion, however, she began to think that maybe Aurora was right. She couldn't stop her work, once it was her mission, but she didn't need to overdo it and cause so much unnecessary suffering to humans."Order and chaos need to be balanced." She thought. "One can not overcome the other." And the image of her and Aurora's pendant came to her head. Together, the two pendants made an image of balance and completeness.Suddenly, it was as if a snap had echoed inside her and Maleficent finally understood why she and Aurora were halves and one needed the other.The more she thought and reflected, the greater became her understanding of herself and Aurora. With that, she understood the princess had every reason to scold her indifference. Her ego didn't agree with it, but she put it in check and decided change some things to keep Aurora's love. She didn't want to lose the only precious thing she had left.The sound was bad and he didn't hear the rest of the conversation. However, a word reached his ears and he finally understood what they planned to do."No way I'll let Maleficent get the ambrosia! This can't happen!" If such thing happens, he was doomed. Maleficent was going to recover her powers and punish him without no mercy. And he knew that the punishment could be the worst thing a man experienced on the Earth. "Ambrosia... curious, I always thought it didn't exist anymore." He had read several stories about this magical food, but believed that the world's stock of ambrosia had exhausted. Then there was a piece left? What would happen if he ate it? According to the legends, this food of the gods healed any sick or damaged body and gave immortality. It was even able to raise the dead!Could it also give him vigor and youth? His eyes sparkled as he imagined himself young again, strong, beautiful and perhaps immortal. So he could harness the abundantly wealth and power he was about to get.If this was true, then he had to get the ambrosia. Determined, he picked up a box that was stored on a shelf and opened. Inside the box, there was a lot of small green stones. A part had been found in Maleficent's bedroom. Another part was found among Aurora's jewels and Helga wanted use them to make a necklace. Fortunately he was able to recover the stones before that brainless bitch destroy them permanently. After counting carefully, he said triumphantly."Perfect! Exactly the amount I need. Now everything is conspiring in my favor!"It had been three or four days that Aurora hadn't talked to Maleficent and the situation was getting complicated again. She didn't want to act that way, but couldn't avoid it.The indifference with which Maleficent watched the suffering of the people was outrageous and she couldn't live with it. Emma tried to talk to her several times in vain. She was also tired of the woman always send the maid to talk to her rather than doing it personally.There was almost no dialogue between them and Aurora never knew what Maleficent was thinking or feeling. She wanted no more declarations of love as shown in the books, but it'd be nice if Maleficent was just a little more sensitive and willing to talk about her feelings. Sometimes Aurora felt like there was a barrier between them that prevented a deeper involvement. She was involved, but the former fairy still seemed distant and emotionally unavailable as if not wanting to establish a strong and lasting bond with her.The top of the hill, she looked at the stars and thought they were too opaque. Or was her mood? She didn't know, just felt sad and alone for loving someone so much and not knowing if was matched with the same intensity.From where he stood, Maleficent watched Aurora while holding her black pendant. She knew what the princess was feeling and what ailed her. How to handle this? How to talk to her? For someone who didn't know talk about her feelings, such a thing was scarier than being unarmed and defenseless before a king about to cut her head. This was perhaps the biggest challenge of her entire life and she didn't know if she was able to face it."I need to do it anyway!" She said stroking Oscar's head. "I have to talk to her but I don not know how to do this. It is so complicated!"The dragon's tail just pointed toward Aurora and she understood it might be better to act rather than think too much. Act... that was what she needed to do. Maleficent always believed that attitudes were more important than words, but somehow talk was also an attitude, because it was to show her feelings and let Aurora know what was going on inside of her heart.And there was also another very important thing she needed to talk to Aurora. It was time for the princess to understand their bond and why they were destined to be together forever. They were two halves and one couldn't live without the other."Well, little one. Stay with Emma. I need to talk to Aurora in particular." Maleficent spoke decisively and Oscar flew towards Emma, who smiled seeing the woman going to Aurora. The things between them were about to be resolved."May I sit down?" One voice said, waking Aurora from her reverie. It was Maleficent. After a little hesitation, she answered."Yes... you can..."She sat beside the young woman, but keeping a respectful distance not to invade her space, and beheld the starry sky for a while."The stars are losing their luster." The older woman said. "Everything is fading, losing life and vigor. The balance has been damaged.""And the only way to restore the balance is to get your powers back." Aurora said bitterly."Yes, but I am only half. One half, by itself, is not enough to restore balance."Aurora turned to her, surprised by what she had just heard."And what's the other half?""You." her answered softly, leaving the princess speechless. "You are the other half, my half.""Your... your half?" She whispered with the heart pounding in chest. The woman took the pendant inside the clothes so that Aurora could see it."I never showed you it before.""It's the same as mine, but all black!" She said showing her pendant."Come closer. I want you to see it." She put an arm around Aurora's waist, pulling the blond close to hers and united the two pendants, which together made a circle. "See? Two halves make sense only when they are together. We are one, Aurora. Do not exist you and I. Only us."There was something different in Maleficent's way of talk and look. For a moment, Aurora almost didn't recognize her."For millennia, only chaos prevailed on the planet. I made many changes and destroyed entire civilizations in the past. And will do it in the future when the time comes. For now, the world needs balance between order and chaos."She separated the two pendants and, still keeping the arm around Aurora's waist, said again."Without chaos, the world will gradually rot and die. Without order, chaos is going to destroy everything that exists and nothing can live in such a world.""And I... I'm the order? But I don't have any power!"The older woman smiled."Your power is to make me understand the consequences of my actions over humans. You are right, I need to learn to have more compassion for people and not to cause them unnecessary suffering."Right. Who was that woman and what she had done with Maleficent? Aurora could hardly believe what was hearing, although felt in heart it was truth."I didn't know that!" She said in a choked voice. "Maleficent, I'm sorry for what I said!""Do not blame yourself. You could not know and it was my duty to tell the truth, but you know how I am proud and hard to handle.""I know very well! So that's why you gave me this pendant on the day of my christening."Yes. When you were born, I had a vision that you are my half and our destiny is to be together forever. Although I didn't understand what it means, I understood that the vision was true because for millennia I felt incomplete. When you were born, that feeling disappeared.""You knew we were going to be a couple?""I would never have imagined such a possibility and could not, you were just a newborn!""So you never expected this?"Maleficent shook her head."No, I did not. And this change scared me so much, I did not know what to do and what to think. So I made a lot of mistakes and things I should not have done. I hope you can forgive me."Tears ran down Aurora's face, who hugged tight her mate and said very touched."I've forgive you, Maleficent! I forgive you because I love you!"She took a deep breath, hugged Aurora tightly and whispered softly in her ear the words she never imagined herself saying to anyone."I love you too, my Aurora. I love you too much!"They were silent for a long time, just letting that wonderful warm flowed freely between them. Feeling more comfortable to talk, Maleficent continued."I know I am not the love you always dreamed of for your life, but I can improve a lot of things. Just understand I am who I am and can not change my essence. I hope one day you accept me."Aurora pulled back a little, without breaking the hug, and looked into her eyes."I don't want you to be the love I always dreamed in the past because these dreams were childish. You are the love I need, that helps me be stronger and better. I don't need any other kind of love because your love is perfect for me."The former fairy couldn't resist and kissed Aurora passionately on the lips, hugging her with all the strength she could muster. There was nothing more to be said between them, just feelings to be experienced. The difficulties weren't over, far from it. They still had plenty of work ahead. But for now, Maleficent wanted to enjoy that magical moment with the certainty she was also loved in the same intensity with which she loved. It was all she needed."That's disgusting, disgusting!" Georgei said erasing the image of the mirror not to see those women doing things that must be done only by persons of opposite sexes. The first thing he wanted to do when become powerful was to banish that kind of abomination of the forbidden lands. It wasn't natural.What made him angrier, however, was them linger so long to get to the destination. Was the ambrosia that far away? Unfortunately, he couldn't do anything before the precious food of the gods was found. The stones could take him anywhere, but he had to know the destination in order to visualize it."Let's see..." he took a piece of paper where had written down his plan and read it aloud to make sure everything was in order. "First, I wait them find the ambrosia. Just so I'll use the stones to take me and some soldiers to where they are. Thus, I can overcome them and take what is rightfully mine. Perfect!"He sipped his glass of wine and continued."So I will torture the skinny, useless princess until Maleficent tells her where her treasures are."He didn't care about Aurora in the slightest, of course, but torturing her to death had a downside. Aragon wanted to marry her. Even though the idiot king had no way of knowing what happened to the princess, it was important he get everything he wanted to be satisfied and leave the Forbidden Lands alone. Well, he just had to be careful not to hurt the princess to the point of leaving her disfigured."Honey, won't you come to bed?" A soft woman's voice called, making him smile. Helga was lying in bed, half naked and showing her beautiful body inviting him for a good night of sex. Well... a little fun wouldn't hurt anyone, right?

"Only three days? This is wonderful!" Emma celebrated, but Maleficent wasn't exactly happy."Do not celebrate yet. Reach the ruins is the easiest part. We still have to overcome the traps and it will not be easy.""So we cant waste time. But first we have to stop in the village to buy supplies. We still have some money, but need to save. Unless I sing in a tavern for..."Maleficent immediately disagreed."Sing for a bunch of drunks? Only over my dead body!""Oh, no! Not again! We've talked about it. There's no problem about singing!""Until some bastard try to kiss you and put a hand inside your cleavage. Only I can do that!""No one will do this, stop this paranoia!""We do not need money, what we have is enough for three days. When I get back to normal, I will take us to the castle in an instant."Oscar and Emma heard little discussion trying to keep from laughing. They were incorrigible! Although they was getting along well, those little quarrels were inevitable. Maleficent was still very jealous while Aurora didn't accept any kind of control or supervision. Alright. They always made peace and ended it all with a warm kiss. At least Maleficent was striving to be a better person. One step at a time. "Ah, a village! Finally!" Emma said interrupting the discussion."I hope they have decent food this time." Maleficent complained, tired of eating bad food every day."We have to save. If the money runs out, I will sing.""I would rather eat Oscar's insects than allow such a thing!""Not again!"The little quarrel lasted until they entered the village, which seemed a bit better than the previous. At least there wasn't an outbreak of the Black Plague. Oscar hid in a small leather pouch that Aurora was carrying once people outside Forbidden Lands didn't react well to the dragons, even one small."It's still early, so we'll purchase supplies, have lunch and then travel to save time." Aurora said counting the coins, which should be more in larger quantity if not for Maleficent's difficulty to deal with money. In the first days of travel, she bought some items paying more than it was worth causing loss to them. The former fairy always had a great treasure at her disposal and never needed to save money.After buying some supplies, which consisted of oatmeal, fruit and dried meat, cheese and black bread, they had lunch in a tavern."This cup is dirty!" Maleficent complained, as usual."You should have gotten used to it!" Aurora said. "We can't afford a better place. I'll try to get another cup."She resisted the temptation and continued eating. Gradually, she was managing to overcome the feeling of disgust that prevented her from eat."Are all children sick?" One man asked another and the conversation reached to Aurora, Maleficent and Emma."Yes, isn't it terrible? All children are with diarrhea.""It seems everything got weird... the winter is ending very soon, the plants don't grow and now people are getting sick. This can only be the devil's work!""That's why the inquisition is hunting witches.""Strange... I've never heard of them acting in this kingdom.""The king never allowed, but you know how powerful they are. Especially after Maleficent disappeared!"The former fairy's lips tightened with anger, because she didn't like one bit of that religion which sent many people to the fire. One of the reasons they aren't as strong in the Stefan's kingdom was her presence. Now the kingdom was unprotected, as well as people who followed their own religious traditions. The clergy was extremely intolerant with differences."Is it true that they burn people alive?" Aurora asked."Yes. I have seen it happen many times. Lot of people who live in the Forbidden Lands fled the Inquisition.""What will happen if you don't come back?""Georgei always been in favor of this religion, but I never cared because he was not a threat. Now in power, he will allow them to enter the Forbidden Lands. A lot of people human and not human are in danger."They finished eating and walked away quickly, but Aurora felt bad for the children. Realizing her concern, the older woman said."Your are worried about these kids, are not you?""Yes, but we have to move on." She replied with great sadness."Well... I guess there is no problem lose a few hours."Her eyes shone."Will we help the children? How? Our money is little.""I still have all my knowledge and I know how to treat diarrhea. We can do this and then move on.""Will they accept our help?" Emma asked."We can try."The orphanage was a big and somewhat unkempt house where there were children abandoned by parents too poor to care for them. Some were adopted and taken to work in the fields or workshops. The place was run by a couple and some women took care of the children the way they could. The work wasn't easy.By having more social skills, Aurora talked with the couple."We knew children are suffering from diarrhea.""Yes, it's very sad." Said Johanna and her husband, Thomas, agreed."It appeared suddenly, nothing ever happened like that before!""My friend is... uh... healer and knows many teas and herbs that can help. If you allow...""We can't pay." the man said looking at the floor."No need, we'll do for free."They were suspicious at first. Why those women were offering help so generously? After much insistence from Aurora, they agreed because were getting desperate. While the princess was at the orphanage explaining the importance of keeping everything clean to avoid rats and diseases, Maleficent went with Emma to look for herbs to be used in tea against diarrhea."I always thought bathing every day was bad for health!" The woman said."No, of course not! This prevents many diseases. It's also important to wash hands before eat, wash utensils and boil water before drink."Gradually Aurora won the initial resistance and managed to put some order in the orphanage. The children bathed, dressed clean clothes and the women have made a good work cleaning the house. Maleficent come back with the ingredients for tea and went into the kitchen."Do not worry, I still know make teas." The woman said to see Emma worried for her cooking.When the tea was ready, it was time to give to children."This will work?" Johanna said while doing some children drinking the tea, which wasn't easy because the tea had a bitter taste."Yes, Mally is excellent with teas to heal." Aurora said. When the woman moved away, Maleficent spoke reproachfully."'Mally'? You only gave ridiculous names!""Don't complain! I can't go around saying your real name.""At least you should have thought of something better! That name is ridiculous and does not suit me!"Aurora went away, leaving Maleficent talking to herself."Do not turn your back on me while I am talking! Come back here! Some children have not taken tea yet!""Give to them!""I?""Yes. And tell a story too. With happy ending!""But... but..." she stuttered trying not to panic with those kids around her. Before could argue with Aurora, the wooden door was closed leaving her alone with those terrible mini-humans who only knew cry and make mess."Will you tell a story for us, auntie?" One little girl about 8 years old asked, leaving Maleficent almost regretted."Story! We want story!" Said a little boy putting one finger in the nose and the woman had to make a big effort not to spew her lunch."Sit down and I do not want to hear any noise! You will finish the tea." She said in an authoritative tone, but the kids didn't hear."No! It's too bitter.""I don't want!""Ew!""Come back here right now! Be quiet!"The children were noisy, leaving her panicked. Some ran wildly and she chased them stumbling into various furniture and wooden toys. Others were crying, some were fighting with each other and one of them took a big bite on her leg, making her scream.From the outside, Aurora laughed until some tears run from her eyes."Is it a good idea? You know she doesn't like children!" Emma said very worried."Then she'll learn to like. And it's so fun! Let's help in cleaning the yard and vegetable garden. They need help!"They walked away ignoring another Maleficent's scream. She could take care of herself."We don't know how to thank you!" Johanna said very grateful. Her husband agreed."With what you have taught us, we can take care of children much better.""You're welcome. Now let's see how Mally is dealing with children. Funny... it's so quiet!""Really!" Emma also realized."She may be very good to deal with kids!"Aurora had doubts, but decided to take a look to see how Maleficent was taking care of children. She was sitting in a chair, with all the children sitting on the floor listening intently."After that the princess fell into a deep sleep, the only way to wake her was one kiss of a prince, but if it happened the princess was going to become a dull and without personality girl. The fairy could not let it happen.""The kiss of a prince shouldn't be a good thing?" a girl asked."Only if there is true love, which did not exist between them. The prince was just a selfish idiot who wanted to marry the princess because her father was very wealthy and powerful."Without Maleficent realizes, Aurora entered the room and listened the story. It was her story."To prevent the prince to kiss the princess, the fairy locked him in her castle. So she could have more time to find a way to break the curse. But then three meddlesome fairies interfered and freed the prince.""Meddlesome fairies!"O child said, accompanied by the other."Ugly fairies!""They're silly!""You are right. They were a foolish. The prince fled the castle and went to the princess. The fairy still tried stop him and even turned herself into a dragon to fight. But all was in vain. In the end, he struck her heart with a sword.""What a sad!""She died?""Well... fairies do not die. She disappeared for a while, but rose again stronger than ever.""And the princess?""She married the prince?"Maleficent smiled and replied."That was going to happen, but the fairy avoided this stupid marriage showing everyone that the prince was a coward. After a while, the princess went to live in her castle, ceased to be a foolish and became a strong, intelligent and fearless woman. But still is skinny as if is starving all the time!"The children gave laughter and Maleficent laughed too, mainly to see Aurora's frown."Well, children, dinner time!" Johanna announced and all left the room in disarray."'skinny as if is starving all the time'? Are you serious?""Next time you leave me locked with those little goblins..." the woman spoke threateningly, but Aurora just laughed."Don't complain, you were great! Let's eat. Johanna and Thomas invited us for dinner. Today has vegetable soup."After dinner, the couple invited the three women to spend the night in the orphanage because it was too late for them to go away. Emma was in a small room that had been arranged for them. Aurora and Maleficent were outside, in the backyard, looking the sky."You never told details about my story.""The fairies wrote a book about you.""With many things that aren't true. So Philip really crossed the forest of thorns made by you?""With fairies' help. Alone, he would not have even tried.""What an idiot! Good thing I didn't marry him. When I fell asleep, all the castle slept as well?""No. They knew you was going to be awake soon. Everything was planned.""So he knew I'm a princess?""Yes, he knew. That idiot never loved you."Aurora was glad to Maleficent changed her life. Despite the difficulties, she was happy. With Philip, her life would just being a submissive and subservient wife with no right to own will.They looked at the stars for a while and Aurora laid the head on the Maleficent's shoulder, who had an arm around her."When the fairies took me to the forest, you looked for to me?""Uninterruptedly for sixteen years. They tricked me becauset I thought your parents hid you in a castle or maybe a convent.""What would you have done if had found me?""I would have taken you to my castle to live with me. What are you laughing?""Sorry, I imagined you changing my diaper."The former fairy made one of her frowns."Not even if my life depended on it! I would have appointed the best babysitters to take care of you and also taken good care of your education. With me, you would not have grown foolish and naive."While listening Maleficent talk about how would she have taken care of her education, Aurora wondered how things could have been if she had found her. Well... she may not have learned Greek, Latin and mathematics, but had a good childhood walking barefoot through the woods, playing with her animal friends, picking berries and living in touch with nature.And most importantly: the fairies gave her care and love, treating her like the daughter they never had. She didn't know if Maleficent would have given the same affection. Even being able to love and have feelings, she had difficulty in express them and wouldn't have been able to be the mother she needed. And it wouldn't have been good since their relationship took another turn. In the end, it was better to have lived with the fairies. It was a very good period of her life. But of course she wasn't going to speak such a thing to the woman."It's late, better we go to sleep because we have to wake up early tomorrow." Aurora said closing the subject because discovered everything she needed to know."I am exhausted. Take care of those human goblins is not easy!"They snuggled together over a cloth lying on the ground. Maleficent quickly fell asleep while Aurora remained awake for a while thinking about what had happened that day. She was happy to see the former fairy was slowly learning to have empathy for people. Maleficent was stubborn and proud, but able to learn."Who could imagine the powerful Maleficent telling story to children? Well... she was forced to do this, but did very well." Aurora thought gently stroking that black hair. Her face was human, but still had the main traits and was still beautiful to her. And she had many qualities too, despite everything.For a long time Aurora focused only on her faults, which were many. Maleficent was arrogant, proud, stubborn, domineering, possessive, severe, insensitive, did not know be romantic or demonstrate the feelings and was the most perverted creature that Aurora had known in her life. On second thought... this last one wasn't exactly a fault. Anyway, she focused too much on Maleficent's defects and forgotten her qualities.That needed to change and Aurora decided to focus more on her qualities, not the faults. Instead of criticism and reprimands, she was willing to give words of support and encouragement. The woman needed affection and patience, needed someone to accept her how she was and help to improve, but still respecting her essence and way of being."Things will change, I promise." She murmured very low after give a kiss on her forehead and then fell asleep too.

It was with eyes full of tears that Aragon and his soldiers reached the palace. They were dirty, hungry, exhausted, ragged, with wounds all over the body and even had lice and ticks. They dragged themselves miserably all the way, full of problems and setbacks."Oh, this is really good!" He said diving in the tub with hot water. Despite having bathed that year, he decided he needed another one because there were still many months to go until the next bath. He intended, within three days, to gather a small army and go to Stefan's kingdom with an ultimatum: give him Aurora's hand in marriage, otherwise the kingdom would be overrun.And to show he wasn't kidding, Aragon intended to show Maleficent's scepter which Georgei had given him so that no one had doubts about his fake feat. Of course Maleficent's head would be much better, but her scepter was enough."Hmm... I wonder what happened to Maleficent. Did she go to the palace with Aurora? This can be a problem. Maybe not, nobody will believe she is Maleficent and if she tries to speak the truth, may be killed. Anyway, I'll do it with my own hands. It will be very easy."The important for him was Aurora to be safe and sound. Otherwise, he would have to declare war to Stefan's kingdom because couldn't just leave without take anything."I hope they have reached the ruins." Flora said annoyed by Aragon has managed to reach the palace."We got a lot of time for them." Fauna said. "He still need to rest, plan his next steps and only then travel to Stefan's kingdom.""When this happens, we will be in action again. It is so fun!" Merryweather has given several giggles, remembering how funny was creating many problems for that arrogant king and his soldiers. Help Maleficent wasn't so bad.She didn't know whether to be happy or sad. On the one hand, they had finally reached the ruins. After many difficulties, setbacks, problems and quarrels, they were close to taking the final steps to achieve their goal. On the other hand, it was one of the ugliest and scary places that Aurora had ever seen. Why Maleficent didn't hide the ambrosia in a more beautiful and welcoming place?"It is here." Former fairy said pointing to the ruins. "The entrance is near here, we have to walk around this large block of stone. There is a passage which is the only entry. ""How many traps did you do?" Aurora asked."Many, perhaps more than a hundred. I planned each one in detail and know how they work."Before they take the next step, Maleficent said very solemnly."I will go anyway, but you are not obligated to follow me.""No way! I'll go with you to the end!" Aurora said firmly."I'll go too, you'll need help." Emma also spoke. She owed allegiance to Maleficent and as a matter of honor and principles, she couldn't retreat."All right. Before enter, I want you to pay careful attention to what I will say now. Follow my steps carefully, step on only where I step, just do what I do and under no circumstances we should split up. It may cost our lives."Aurora and Emma agreed."There are a lot of mazes inside the ruins and more than a hundred traps, but we will not pass through all of them because I know the right way. That is why you must not lose sight of me, do you understand?""Yes, we understand."With Oscar's help, they lit several torches and entered the ruins taking every care to pay attention to Maleficent and her movements. The place was dark, cold and wet. Their field of vision was limited only to where the dim light of the torches reached. Maleficent went ahead, walking very carefully not to step in any wrong place."Pay attention." She said stepping only on certain stones. "If you set foot in the wrong place, we will die crushed."Aurora took a deep breath and followed the woman. Emma came shortly after entreating aid to her ancestors.Georgei watched the three women biting his nails and hurting the fingers. Of course he didn't care about their safety, he just didn't want to see them dead before reach the ambrosia. Besides, he needed Aurora and Maleficent. Otherwise he could never know where the treasures were.  "Take care, take great care! Oh, I don't want to look!" He said covering his face for a while. But curiosity was stronger and he was watching again. That thriller was killing him!"I wish the princess and the maid die smashed !" Helga said also watching everything, leaving him angry."I don't care about the maid, but the princess can't die. I don't know if Maleficent will cooperate with me, so I need to have Aurora as a guarantee.""Then you'll bring her back to the castle?""If necessary, yes.""On second thought... I'd love to torture her and take all that beauty with my nails!" She said sadistically, this time hoping that Aurora didn't die with the traps because a much worse fate awaited her.Of course Georgei wasn't going to let her do that because he might receive a good reward if he took her to Aragon. But since he didn't have the patience to argue with that stupid bitch, he just kept watching."Watch out for the stakes! Look at the stakes!""There are many tunnels!" Aurora said amazed to see the maze was much worse than she imagined. They were in a large gallery and there was at least twenty different entries and only one was correct."They all have the most gruesome traps that you can imagine. Fortunately, I know the right way. Follow me and be careful because there are traps here as well."They walked slowly to the entrance of a tunnel when Maleficent heard a pop."Damn! Run!" The woman screamed and they ran in the same instant that fireballs filled the gallery. Aurora tried to protect herself and Oscar while Emma ran as fast as she could. Finally they reached a small and narrow tunnel and escaped the flames."God, I've never seen so much fire in my life!" Emma gasped frightened."That was just the beginning."The woman was right. Everywhere had the worst traps. Poisoned arrows coming out of the walls, trap doors that were open on the ground and led to deep wells full of large spikes, iron balls leaving the ceiling to crush any unsuspecting people, cutting blades that appeared suddenly, some tunnels collapsed, others were flooded and in some cases the walls closed almost crushing the three women.If not for the great Maleficent's knowledge about each trap, they had died quickly. Still, it was very difficult and laborious. They were hurt, too exhausted and weak. But had to continue at all costs."We can rest for a while, it is safe here." Maleficent said when they came in a big empty cave."You're hurt. Let me handle this." Aurora said trying to take care of Maleficent's injuries."This is nothing, I will be fine. You are also hurt. I am sorry you have to suffer all this for me... ""We've talked about this. I'm here because I want to help you.""Your foolish." She murmured with a red face. It was hard to admit that without the Aurora's help, she wouldn't have gotten there.After a time of rest, they kept on going and had to cross a bridge of stone that could crumble at any sudden movement."Be careful." Former fairy said."This is shaking!" Emma said with fear, trying to walk as carefully as possible."The bridge will fall. Run!" Maleficent screamed and they ran fast. She reached the other side and firmly gripped Aurora's arm avoiding her fall, but they couldn't hold Emma."Emma! No!" Aurora screamed terrified, calling her friend several times. The abyss was dark and they couldn't see anything.Maleficent lowered her head, also lamenting the loss."Oh... my arm!" Came a muffled voice from down there."Emma! Are you okay? Oscar, I need light!"The dragon lit a stick to her see in the darkness. About thirty feet below, on a large rock projecting out of the cliff, Emma was lying and holding one arm with the other hand. She was injured, but alive."Wait, we'll help you!" Aurora said looking around to see if there was something to help her friend."You need to move on.""We won't leave you here no way!""Aurora, listen, you'll die if try to get me out. It's very dangerous. When Maleficent back to normal, it will be easier to rescue me.""Do not worry, Aurora. I swear I will be back to rescue her."She hold back the tears and nodded."All right, let's go. Hold on, Emma! We'll be back!"They ran hand in hand, fighting and overcoming many other traps."We are almost there. The room where the ambrosia is stored is just ahead.""Good!"Aurora was following Maleficent when she heard a little shriek. She put on alert and saw something flying toward Maleficent. With one swift motion, she pushed the woman to the ground saving her from a large sharp spear. But she couldn't swerve and was hit in the back."Aurora! No!"She screamed and cried in pain while Maleficent tried to help her."Calm down, Aurora, I am here! I am here!"She managed to remove the spear, which didn't dug deep into her back, but the wound was bleeding badly and she quickly put a bandage to stop the bleeding. Was all she could do until regain her powers. So Maleficent put her body over one shoulder and kept walking as fast as she could.The room where the ambrosia was saved was sealed by a door which could be opened only by deciphering many ancient symbols that only Maleficent knew the meaning. Fortunately, her knowledge wasn't lost when she became human."We are close. Hold on, Aurora!" She pressed the stones, taking great care not make mistakes. She only had a try and if made a single mistake, the consequences would be disastrous.The guards were ready and heavily armed. Georgei had given a stone to each one with the instructions of pressing it in their hands while thinking about the image displayed on the mirror. He just needed to wait for Maleficent opened the door of the room where the ambrosia was saved. His victory was so near!When the last symbol of the sequence was pressed, the door opened and Maleficent entered quickly, placing Aurora carefully on a large stone tablet. In a kind of altar, decorated with statues of great dragons that seemed fierce, Maleficent opened a large safe and pulled out a box of black color which was saved the precious ambrosia. All that nightmare was about to end.Inside the box there was a small portion enough for a single person. It was everyone's salvation. But before she could eat the precious delicacy, an annoying voice almost hurt her ears."Don't make any move or your beloved princess will die!" She turned and saw Georgei along with several soldiers.The woman trembled with rage, but wasn't willing to give up so easily. If she gave the ambrosia for that miserable, he'd kill them anyway."Idiot, I already have the ambrosia and you can not do anything!" She said menacingly."If you don't give me it right now, my soldier will kill this insignificant princess with a single blow!" To show he was serious, he ordered a soldier to raise the sword over Aurora, who was lying on the stone tablet and helpless."Maleficent, no! Eat the ambrosia!" The princess said in a weak voice, leaving the fairy in despair. No, she didn't want to sacrifice Aurora to regain her powers. But do what Georgei wanted wasn't going to save their lives."You decide, your creature of the devil. Give me the ambrosia now or the princess dies! And you'll also tell me the location of your treasures! I want everything! "Summoning all her strength, Aurora tried to get up a bit and talked to the guards."You are betraying Maleficent to help this horrible man! How can you?" Maleficent understood everything. One thing she learned being human was the art of bargaining in times when brute force was useless."Stay by my side and you all will be well rewarded. You will get enough gold to live in luxury and comfort until the fourth generation of your descendants!"The guards lowered their weapons slowly with the eyes shining with greed. They knew that Maleficent had huge amounts of gold and could fulfill her promise. Mischievous as ever, Georgei countered."Don't be silly! She'll kill you all when regain her powers! You know she doesn't accept betrayal!""I'm willing to forgive you." she said after a great effort, because never forgive a betrayal. This time, she was willing to give in to save Aurora."Do you believe in this demonic creature?""She always fulfills her promises and you know it!" The princess tried to argue. With a titanic effort, she stood up and went to Maleficent's side."You should not be doing this!" The woman said very worried. Aurora kept talking."If this man wins, he'll make everyone's life a living hell! He'll end up with all the good laws that Maleficent created for the welfare of everyone and be a tyrant!""Bullshit! I'll be a much better king than this creature!""No one can be a better than her! She rules the Forbidden Lands for the good of everyone, take care of people, protect them from invaders and thanks to her, there is no hunger, sickness or misery! This man will never do better than her!"The pain was too great, as well as bleeding. Aurora fell on her knees and Maleficent tried to hold her, kneeling beside her."Quick, eat ambrosia!""No! You won't do that!" Georgei screamed desperately. And seeing the guards weren't reacting, he decided to appeal to the last alternative. "I'll share the treasures with who help me in equal parts! You'll have the riches worthy of a king and may even have your own kingdoms!"If Aurora had succeeded in awakening guards' good sense, Georgei aroused their greed and this feeling was stronger than all. Maleficent never would give them so much wealth. On second tought, she might even kill them because didn't tolerate betrayers.Seeing the guards chose to stay at Georgei's side, Aurora shouted."Oscar! Now! "The little dragon spit fire with all his strength. The blast of fire distracted them only by the ten seconds before the dragon fell exhausted beside Aurora. It was over.The guards grabbed the two women strongly and the former fairy screamed and struggled, more worried with Aurora than with herself. One of the guards took the box and handed it to Georgei, who exclaimed very happy and satisfied."Perfect! I won!" he gave a hysterical laughter and opened the box only to see that there was nothing there. "It's empty? No! Your miserable devil! Where is the ambrosia? What did you do to it?"Maleficent also widened her eyes, because she was absolutely sure that ambrosia was in the box."Where is it? Tell me right now!" he screamed threatening. "I want to ambrosia or the princess will die!""Leave her alone, you bastard!" Shouted Maleficent being held by two guards while another pointed his sword toward Aurora, who was lying on the ground almost unconscious."Then give me the ambrosia now! I demand!"Having received no response, since Maleficent didn't know where the ambrosia was, Georgei lost his cool ordered one of the guards."Cut a piece of the princess. Can be an arm or a leg, it doesn't matter! Let's see what this demon will think to see her princess being torn to pieces!" He was so blinded with hatred and greed that no longer cared about taking Aurora alive to Aragon. All that mattered was getting what he wanted."No! Do not do it! I will reveal where are my treasures, but leave her alone!" Maleficent screamed terrified."I want to ambrosia too, I want it all!"The guard raised his sword, but didn't dare to strike a so delicate and helpless young woman."Lord... I can't... she's very hurt and never harmed anyone!" The man said lowering his sword."Do it or die with them!""Then so be it!""Guards, attack!" He shouted and the other guards moved against them.The man took his sword and lunged at the two soldiers who held Maleficent, throwing them to the ground with well-aimed blows. Being free, Maleficent hugged Aurora pulling her to her chest. The rebel soldier was soon subdued by five strong men."It's over, creature of the devil! You'll tell me right now where is the ambrosia and treasures, or both will be dead!" Georgei threatened.Maleficent panted heavily, feeling anger and helplessness before that arrogant man. She didn't care to tell the location of her treasures, but had no idea what had happened to the ambrosia."I do not know where the ambrosia is, but you need not it. My treasures are enough!" She said trying to negotiate, but he remained adamant."Kill the princess now!" he ordered furious and a soldier pointed his sword at Aurora. Maleficent tried to shield her with the body, holding her still more against her chest."Maleficent..." a weak voice called."Aurora, sorry, I failed!" She spoke with two tears running through her eyes because couldn't protect the person she loved most.Without saying anything, the princess held her face with one hand and pressed the lips to hers gently, making Georgei cry of anger and disgust.The woman closed her eyes to accept what could be the last kiss when felt something solid being spit into her mouth and finally understood everything. Of course, Aurora's hands were faster than her eyes. She should have known that. Wasting no time, she swallowed the ambrosia quickly and soon felt a great release of energy running through her body and her eyes shone brightly.A sinister and scary laughter echoed throughout the room.

"No! No! "Georgei yelled desperate to see he had been tricked. "Guards, kill her! Now!"Maleficent's body raised in the air and a strong burst of energy made all men fell to the ground. Green rays sparkled everywhere and her appearance changed slowly. Her skin became pale, slightly green, the eyes got that supernatural combination of green and yellow, the horns grew on her head and a black and purple fluttering clothes materialized over her body. A strong and deafening roar echoed everywhere along with rays that electrocuted the gards and especially georgei, leaving them stunned and unable to run.When the transformation was complete, she lowered herself to the ground and held Aurora in her arms carefully."You came back...""Yes, I am back. Now sleep, everything will be fine, I promise. Sleep..."Aurora's eyes grew heavy and she soon fell fast asleep. Maleficent then put Oscar over princess's body and gave them to the soldier who had rebelled against Georgei."Take them to the outside of this room and wait for me." the man left the room happy and relieved to be free from tortures that other men were about to suffer.When the door was closed, Maleficent looked at those condemned men like a snake looked to a prey. She had a demonic glint in her eyes and gave her more sadistic and wicked smile. They were scared and couldn't run away, just wait for their inevitable fate."Very well, where should I start?"From the outside, the soldier was trembling from head to foot and tried not to faint with fear at the most terrifying, piercing and anguished screamns that he heard in his entire life. Heavens! Could a person scream like that? And not only were screams. He also heard bangs, knocks and sounds of things being broken. If hell had a sound, it should be very similar to one that came to his ears. And to give him an idea of what was happening inside, he saw blood seeping under the door, a vision that was never going to get out of his mind, like the infernal sounds coming from inside. For the first time, he saw how Maleficent was terrible and deserved to be feared and respected."Did you feel that?" Fauna asked being on alert. There was a very different energy in the air, something she couldn't explain, but feel. The other fairies agreed.(Merryweather) "Yes, I can feel it."(Fauna) "Maleficent regained her powers and is back! Heavens, she got it!"Maleficent's magic was so strong and powerful that fairies could find her anywhere in the world and they decided to go to where she was, since were very concerned with Aurora and Emma. They flew quickly and soon saw a strange green cloud formation over ancient ruins. The wind blew strongly and lightning flashed everywhere."Where are they?" Flora and asked her question was soon answered when they saw Maleficent walking towards them with Aurora in her arms. Oscar was over one of her shoulders and behind her came Emma with the arm supported in a splint and an unknown man."Aurora, my poor child! What happened to her?" Merryweather asked panicking."She is just sleeping."Princess's clothes had changed to a beautiful dark purple dress and her face was calm. Flora said."Glad you have your powers back. Aragon departed for Stefan's kingdom and we were afraid we can't delay him enough.""Do not worry, I will take care of him later. Now I have to go, Aurora needs to rest. She deserves it."The fairies agreed, happy and relieved to have this nightmare over. Even not liking natural disasters and chaos she caused, they understood that it was essential for balance and survival of humans. In the end, Maleficent was a necessary evil.The fairy did open a portal and was about to through it when Merryewather called."Let us get one thing clear, Maleficent!" She said boldly. "We do not like you and you do not like us!""Totally agree!" Fairy growled."But we tolerate you because of Aurora and we want to see her happy. So take good care of her or you will have problems with us!""Idiots fairies! Of course I will take good care of Aurora. She will be happier with me than with any idiot prince."That said, she entered the portal being followed by Emma, who said goodbye to them, and for a soldier happy to know he was going to be very well rewarded.In the abandoned ruins, remained just several mangled and burned bodies, so disfigured it was hard to believe they were humans one day.Aurora woke up yawning and stretching the body lazily. What a wonderful sleep! It was as if she had slept in soft and fluffy clouds."Good morning, sleepyhead!" A voice greeted cheerfully and she saw Emma beside the bed holding a tray with breakfast."Emma! Are you okay? And your arm? Where's Maleficent?"Hey, calm down! One question each time. Yes, I'm fine. Her Excellency healed my arm and now she is taking care of some urgent business. It seems that Georgei messed some things up and now she needs to get everything in order.""Why am I in her bedroom?""She thought you'd be more comfortable.""Then she regained her powers. How nice!"Aurora took breakfast and while Emma was preparing her bath to start the day, she looked at her reflection in the large mirror to check on the wound on her back. There was nothing and her skin was smooth as always. Maleficent should have healed that and other injuries."Your bath is ready." The maid called."How were things when we arrived?""Georgei wanted to strike down laws she had created and force everyone to accept his religion. Everyone was dissatisfied and was a matter of time before the people to rebel. Now everyone is fine."The bathtub of Maleficent's bathroom was practically a small pool and Aurora plunged happy for that nightmare is over. While helping her bathe, Emma told what had happened since they arrived to the castle. The princess had slept for three whole days thanks to fairy's magic. This made her body recover faster.Those who opposed Georgei and remained faithful to Maleficent were rewarded. Who supported that nasty man was punished. The guard who helped them received gold enough to ensure wealth and prosperity until the fourth generation of his family, as she had promised."I've never seen anyone smile as much as he did! It was funny."Since he was innocent and never did anything to Aurora, Baltazar also received great compensation and he wanted to become a trader. His attraction to Helga became a thing of the past because she never loved him. And to be honest, he didn't love her and had to undergo great suffering to understand that character and honesty were worth much more than a pretty face and a generous pair of breasts."About Helga, she is now in the dungeon. Her Excellency left for you to decide her punishment."The princess thought for a moment and then gave a wicked smile. No, she didn't intend to torture Helga nor hurt her. This kind of thing could be part of Maleficent's nature, but she didn't act like that. For someone so materialistic and arrogant, who didn't know to value more noble things like love, family and friendship, she had a much more appropriate punishment. For now, she just wanted to relax and rest. Those weeks were a real trial, which showed many things about Maleficent, improved their relationship and strengthened the bond between them.She knew the fairy still had a long way to go and was never going to be a sweet, gentle and godly person. At most, she just learn to have more respect and empathy for humans, but couldn't stop her work to manage the chaos in the world. What made Aurora happy was to know the fairy loved her so much that was willing to give up the treasures and even of the powers to save her life. There could be no greater proof of love than this, and now Aurora was sure of fairy's feelings, even though she didn't speak often.After wear a new dress, Aurora went for a walk in the garden with Oscar. The winter had returned, but by the time of year they were in, it was about to end. The climate suffered a great imbalance that could have a high price to people."Will Maleficent take long to come back? I miss her." The princess said stroking the wings of her baby. More than ever, she was happy with the wicked fairy.Maleficent smiled victoriously before the arrogant king who was kneeling in front of her begging for mercy. Stefan and Leah watched everything with a mixture of fear and relief, understanding it was much better to be her ally than her enemy."Your worm, so you thought you could defeat me?" she roared holding the scepter she had taken back. "Mercy, please, mercy! I'll do what you want, I'll give you my treasures!""Enough! This kingdom is under my protection. When trying to invade it, you challenged me. And you had the audacity to think about take the princess Aurora as a wife! This insult will not go unpunished!"The king and queen didn't know exactly what the fairy was talking about, but were relieved by Aurora not have married that so brutal and cruel man. Aurora didn't deserve that.Faced with the wrath of Maleficent, Aragon pressed his face to the ground and continued begging for mercy and offering his treasures. She humiliated him, insulted and even threatened to curse him if he tried invading that kingdom again."For the damage you caused, I demand your treasures that were stolen from other kingdoms. You will return everything, because now there are people in poverty because of your assaults.""Yes mistress, I'll do it, mistress""And you will free the kingdoms conquered, they not belong to you. Never again try to invade any other kingdom, or I will curse thee to the tenth generation of your family! I am dead serious, do not play with me!"Of course he'd rather lose an arm or a leg than give up his treasures and conquered lands, but he wasn't crazy to disobey the orders of the most powerful fairy in the world. Was better to gave some rings and kept the fingers."Now get out out of my face, little worm!"He ran away quickly, humiliated and with tail between legs. Stefan asked humbly."Your Excellency, how is Aurora? For weeks we have not heard from her and we are concerned.""Aurora is very well and will visit you soon."Without another word, she disappeared leaving them confused, but relieved to know their daughter was fine.For a moment Philip thought he had died and been taken to the gates of paradise. How could such a beautiful place be in the midst of ugly, lifeless desert? It made him sure that that was the right person to help him defeat Maleficent.The building was built in the Greek style, with large marble columns, sculptures and walls richly decorated with mythological figures. Anyone could tell that it was the Mount Olympus."Finally! I got it! "The man exclaimed glad for his walk not have been in vain. Sure he still needed talk to the wizard and convince him to help, but if he could get up there, then could do everything. He was willing to take the risk.She was motionless pretending to sleep, but those hot and moist lips covering her back were hard to ignore."I know you are awake." A voice said seductively. "You want too. No use pretending!" She kept giving wet kisses on her back, butt and thighs. When she opened her legs and touched her wet intimate part, Aurora could no longer resist."You're a pervert!" she said turning belly up and Maleficent hugged her tightly."Do not complain, you like when I am a pervert.""Yes, I like it. And also like when you kiss me.""No need to ask twice!"Again, the bedroom was filled with the sound of moans and cries of pleasure. According to Maleficent, they had lost many precious nights, then had to make up for lost time."Um... it was wonderful!" exclaimed Aurora falling exhausted."Totally agree. Hug me!"They hugged in silence, just feeling the warmth of each other. These moments were wonderful and priceless. Maleficent didn't showed affection in public yet, but always did it generously in particular. In her own way, of course. And Aurora learned to accept and appreciate her way of showing love. Many things had changed since they returned. The first change was Aurora to occupy Maleficent's bedroom, which was now hers too. They were mates, so it made no sense each one have her own bedroom separately.Another change was the achievement of an egalitarian relationship. Of course it was still difficult for Maleficent accept this kind of thing, but Aurora knew command respect and put limits on the fairy's domineering attitudes. It was necessary to be firm and know to say "no" when necessary. At the same time, the princess was soft, tried to focus on Maleficent's qualities and always praised when she did something good or right. Positive reinforcement always helped.Be received at the Greek palace wasn't easy. At the entrance, he was stopped by two huge stone griffins. Was necessary to insist much until a human guard showed up to hear him. Then he had to insist twice to not be killed and triple to get an audience with the wizard who didn't like receiving unexpected visitors.Inside, the place had beautiful gardens filled with exotic flowers and plants. Small lakes, rivers and waterfalls composed a harmonious whole, together with some beautiful and colorful songbirds. Everything was clean, well maintained and decorated richly with gold, silver, precious stones, oriental tapestries and works of art that Philip never saw even in the most luxurious palaces and he was worried. What would he had to offer to someone so rich?The guard ordered him to wait in front of an empty throne adorned with velvet, gold and silver. The wait was long and he nearly fell asleep right there. Much later, the servants entered the throne room. Beautiful women richly dressed brought trays with wine, delicacies and fruits. Two servants carried large fans made with peacock feathers and other five brought musical instruments that Philip had never seen before.Everyone were positioned around the throne as if were perfectly synchronized. Later, two women came spraying the area around the throne with an exotic and rare perfume that reached his nostrils and was aspirated pleasurably. Two other women, holding silver bowls, came throwing petals of red and white roses on the floor, making a path up to the throne.After all pomp and preparation, finally showed up the person with whom Philip wanted to talk. His eyes widened when he saw a very handsome man who was like a legitimate Greek God. His name was Féres and he wore a white tunic embroidered with gold thread. Around his body, there was a large red cloth that almost dragged the ground and over his head a crown that seemed made of laurel leaves, but it was entirely made of gold. He wore gold sandals and had gold bangles on wrists.What most impressed, however, was her physical beauty. Those hairs was so blond and golden as Aurora's. His eyes looked like emeralds and he had a smooth skin and delicate traits, but in no way seemed effeminate. His lips were well done and the nose resembled him those Greek statues he had seen in books.Philip waited patiently for the wizard sit the throne, talk with some servants, took a glass of wine, eat one dry apricot and only then he decided to give a little attention to that strange visitor from a foreign country."My guards said you came from a distant land, in the continent, and has a very good offer for me. Well, are you authorized to speak now. Say what you want."After making a respectful bow, Philip explained why he was there. Féres heard all quietly as if was listening a small child talking silly and fanciful things."That's why I'm here sir... majesty... excellence..." "I like majesty. That's all?""Yes, your Majesty.""Well. My guards will escort you to the exit. Thanks for wasting my time."The young king was startled."But Majesty! I can offer gold, precious stones and..." he was interrupted by a cynical laugh. And after a brief wizard's glance, the servants around laughed for a while until everyone shut up with a gesture of his hand."Look around you, idiot! I don't need your crumbs. Do you think I'll fight with the most powerful fairy in the world just for a handful of gold? ""I... I'll do what you want, anything! My kingdom is very powerful, and I can offer an alliance... " it was useless Philip beg and plead. He had nothing that would interest the wizard.There was a very strong reason why he didn't want to face Maleficent. She was hunting him and if she found him, he was going to be tortured in the worst possible way. He was safe in the middle of the island of Crete using an enchantment that could hide him from her. He wasn't crazy to risk his life just for a little useless glory.Seeing he couldn't convince him, Philip started begging in the hope of softening his heart."Please, I beg you! She kidnapped my bride and none of my soldiers have the courage to help me rescue her! I fought with her once, but now she is even more powerful! ""I'm sorry, little king. I don't want to be your champion. Why don't you seek another bride? There are so many beautiful women in the world...""But Aurora is the most beautiful of all, your Majesty! No woman is more beautiful than the one who received the gift of the beauty from a fairy."The initial expression of Féres was of cynicism and mockery. But when heard the words "gift of the beauty from a fairy", his face turned serious."Wait a minute. You said she received the gift of beauty? From a fairy? Explain it to me.""When she was a baby, the king invited three good fairies to her christening. One of them gave her the gift of beauty. She also has the gift of song and...""Enough, only the first gift cares to me.""Majesty?""Come on, little king. I think, after all, you have something good to offer.""That sounds interesting. Are you sure it is your will?" Maleficent asked when they were going to the dungeon."Yes. For someone like Helga this is the perfect punishment.""On that I agree, but why are you giving the possibility of reversing the punishment?""Well... everyone deserves a second chance, right? Perhaps she learns about the true inner beauty."It wasn't the kind of punishment that Maleficent would give, but it could be fun. Because Aurora was directly offended by Helga, the fairy understood she had the right to decide the punishment and was willing to respect her decision even disagreeing. But this time she agreed.Helga was in one of the cells with the dress torn, hairs disheveled and was dirty as a beggar. She had lost her jewels, beautiful dresses, privileges, everything! When Maleficent came back to the castle, her good and luxurious life ended in a second and she was thrown in that dungeon. Damn! Why did she get involved with Georgei? Why didn't she accept marry with Baltazar? Now she was abandoned in that dungeon awaiting punishment. The woman knew Maleficent had no mercy on anyone.The sound of the cell door being opened made her stand up scared to see the fairy entering along with Aurora."Very well, it is time to face your punishment."Her body shook strongly and she cried thinking of unimaginable tortures she was about to suffer. When saw a kind of green fire out of fairy's hands, she shrank covering her face trying to protect herself. An unpleasant electric shock through her body, causing the woman to scream in pain. It lasted no more than two minutes and she fell to the ground exhausted and confused."It is done."Helga looked up and saw Maleficent looking at her showing visible disgust, while Aurora showed pity. Still confused and not knowing what was happening, she stood slowly and looked at her own body, which seemed strange and awkward. Why one of her legs looked bigger than the other? Why her hands and fingers were crooked and wrinkled? Whence came these huge warts?"I think you will enjoy seeing it." The fairy said maliciously making a mirror appear before Helga, who gave a hysterical and terrified scream upon seeing her reflection.No, that wasn't her face! No way! What kind of freak she had become? Her nose was huge, deformed and with two big warts on the tip. Her face was also full of warts, wrinkles and horrible skin blemishes. Her teeth were dark and crooked and the ears grew disproportionately, one being greater than the other. Her beautiful red hair became a matted and ugly thing like a rat's nest and her body looked like a big ball supported by thin and skewed limbs.She screamed and cried desperately, begging to be killed and Maleficent watched her suffering laughing with satisfaction. Aurora was right, it was the worst punishment for someone like Helga. Apparently, the princess had learned a thing or two with her."This is your punishment. as beautiful on the outside as on the inside and so you will be until the day you learn to cultivate true inner beauty.""Please, your Excellency, kill me now! Kill me! I want to die! I'd rather die!"With pity, Aurora tried to help her."Helga, this is for you to learn to value the right things in life. Learn to be beautiful inside, to value love, friendship and family. When successful, the spell will be broken and you'll return to normal."It was useless to speak because those concepts were beyond her comprehension. Aurora could only hope one day she'd be able to learn. All over, Maleficent ordered her to be taken to a small pig farm to work as a servant. At least she was going to have food and shelter and protection."Will she be fine?" Aurora asked when saw the wagon coming out of the castle."Yes, she will be well treated."They went back into the castle and Maleficent said."You will be pleased to know the outbreak of Black Plague of that village has been contained. People are recovering and the rats were eradicated. I sent supplies for them and also to the orphanage on behalf of King Stefan.""Why don't you want to let people know you are helping them?"The answer came with a wicked smile."Reputations do not come from night to day and I had a lot of work to build mine. I do not want to be seen as a good fairy, it is so humiliating!"Aurora couldn't help but laughing. Maleficent was really incorrigible!

When Féres said what was the price of his help, Philip almost let a glass of wine fall to the floor, which would have made a huge dirt on the beautiful Persian rug."Aurora? Are you serious? But... but... I want to marry her!""Oh, please, stop underestimating my intelligence! I know you don't love this woman."He gasped surprise for being so easily exposed. It was impossible lie to that wizard."Anyway, I need to marry her to get right to the throne and the kingdom!""You'll marry her, little king. But you needn't stay married for entire life."Seeing Philip hadn't understood, he explained."What would happen if an unfortunate accident killed your beloved wife, leaving you widower and heartbroken?"After a little hesitation, he answered."I... I still would have the right to succession to the throne, but only after King Stefan dies."Féres shrugged."This can be arranged easily. It's not impossible that she, along with her parents, have an accident that will kill them all, leaving you as the sole survivor. To me, this is as easy as plucking petals from a flower."That proposal was quite daunting. Despite not loving Aurora, at any time he thought about killing her or her parents."You fool, I didn't intend to kill the princess in this accident. She is my prize and I want her. However, everyone will think she also died along with her parents. It's simple.""Why do you want Aurora?""That's none of your business. Just accept this agreement and I promise you'll have two kingdoms under your command."As Philip still hesitated, the wizard said threatening."You never cared about ethics and moral before, won't do so now you're so close to realizing your dreams, will you? Besides, you wasted a lot of my time and left me bored. My boredom only over when I feed my pet lions and tigers."A very great terror overwhelmed him."My 'kittens' love eat meat. Can you guess which kind of meat they like most?"The message was well understood. If he didn't accept the proposal, would be transformed into a snack for hungry lions and tigers. This made any moral judgments were forgotten and his conscience didn't show any sign of pain. His life was at stake and he didn't intend to sacrifice himself for a woman who didn't love."Have we a deal? This is your last chance!" Philip answered without hesitation."Yes, Your Majesty, we have an agreement. You help me defeat Maleficent and Aurora will be yours."The man thought for a moment, cynically looking at the young king. Philip sweated and struggled not to fall apart. Finally, he said scornfully."I guess I have to feed my kittens with another type of meat today. Very well, little king, we have an agreement. I promise we'll profit greatly!"A sigh of relief let his lips. the deal was sealed and there was no turning back. And he didn't want that.Maleficent didn't like social events, but it was the wedding of the son of a great and important ally. She was the guest of honor and needed to prestige her allies to keep their support."This dress is beautiful!" Aurora exclaimed amazed by the beauty of the new dress that the milliner had done."Of course is beautiful, dear! I did with my own hands! Oh, how wonderful! It's much better to make dresses for you than for that Helga. Yuck! Now let's put your new jewelry!"This time Aurora was wearing a dark red dress with long sleeves and black floral patterns. The dress had a square neckline that showed her beautiful skin and she wore a black tourmaline necklace, matching earrings and tiara. A little makeup and everything ready."It's perfect! Divine! Phenomenal! "Aurora also approved the result. Different and extravagant, but she liked it. "Are you ready?" The fairy said entering the room."Yes, I am."The milliner bowed and left, only then Maleficent said."You look beautiful." Aurora's face blushed at the praise."Thank you. Now we can go. They say the party will be very great, I'm so excited!"The red mouth smirked."Excited? Um... So we have to take care of it!""What? No, I mean something else... Maleficent, we have a party to go to, we can't delay. Hey, you're squeezing my butt! Oh, not the neck, this is dirty trick!"It was difficult to contain fairy's passionate outbursts and Aurora could only convince her with the promise of a hot night when they came back from the party.It was the wedding of the son of a great and wealthy nobleman diplomat from neighboring kingdom, who lived in a castle almost as big as Maleficent's. Guests came from all over the kingdom and abroad. Noble, some royals, wealthy merchants, major generals and politicians. When all the guests were gathered for the start of the ceremony, Maleficent came along with Aurora."Your Excellency and Your Highness honors us immensely with your presence!" the host and his wife bowed respectfully. "The servant will refer you to the seat of honor, if that is to your liking."Maleficent just nodded and they were taken to one of the few cabins intended only for the most important guests. From these cabins, was possible to see the whole hall and the altar of the ceremony, giving an insider's view and a little more privacy too."Wow, how many people!""He is very important and influential. The wedding of his son should be worthy of his status.""Who's the bride?""The daughter of a baron who is family friend for many years.""It's an arranged marriage, isn't it? I feel sorry for her...""Among rich, nobles and royalty, marriages are always arranged.""I'm glad I escaped that fate. It must be horrible!"Aurora looked at the great hall thanking for the chance to be with the one she loved. It wasn't a conventional relationship because besides being a woman, Maleficent wasn't human. Society at the time didn't accept this kind of thing and it would take many centuries until people begin to respect. And despite knowing she couldn't have children and raise a family, Aurora wouldn't trade her life for any other. She was happy the way which thought was right.The music started playing, drawing her attention. The bride entered wearing a beautiful red and gold dress with very long skirts dragging on the ground. The sleeves were long, showing only the fingertips, ruffled collars and bodice.She still felt sorry for her, but wished that woman could be happy. Unfortunately, not everyone could choose their own way like her.Suddenly, a hand ran down her thigh making her face flush. Fortunately the other guests couldn't see what that pervert fairy was doing."Behave yourself!" Aurora whispered and Maleficent ignored totally."No one is watching.""Really? So in this game, two can play!" She did the same thing, caressing a Fairy's thigh over her long cloak. Maleficent bit her lower lip trying to keep a straight face, which was difficult. That princess had quick hands!Really, that night promised to be delicious!In a small lake in the garden, Féres watched Maleficent and Aurora in their romantic demonstrations ignoring the wedding ceremony. Beside him, Philip also watched them without know what was going on. Those strange touches, glances, smiles... "Why are they... uh... caressing each other this way?""Because, your silly little king, they are lovers. What? Are you shocked? Oh, poor innocent child! So you didn't know two women can also do these things?"He was in shock for a moment before he could speak again."How does this happen? I mean... how they... they... " Féres rolled his eyes."That doesn't matter because I found Maleficent's weak point and know how you'll defeat her."His eyes widened."Who? I? But our agreement...""Your fool! If you want to be seen as a hero and have the respect of everyone, you can't send someone else fight your battles! This is so simple!""How will I defeat her?""With a very special sword that I'll do for you. I begin work today. Within three days, we'll go to the continent. That's the plan."It was a very hazardous plan and if went wrong, Philip was going to suffer the consequences alone. Asshole wizard! Well... it was too late to retreat.Féres dismissed Philip and went to a room where prepared spells and potions. There were many types of metals made with complicated processes of alchemy. One of them was exactly what he needed. It was a rare and hard to do metal, but the prize was worth."Soon, the princess Aurora will be mine!""Are you sure you are fine? It is the fourth time you feel bad today." Stefan said after the maid left the bedroom carrying a bucket with dinner that Leah expelled minutes before."Yes, I am fine. I have been really worried about Aurora and the rest of the kingdom. The crops will suffer and I fear that our people go hungry!"The king placed a hand on her shoulder gently."My dear, let me worry about these issues. And Aurora sent us a letter saying she will come visit us soon. Try not to worry too much!""I know, but I can not help. Oh, my stomach! I am so sick!"She lay down to rest, closing her eyes hoping that discomfort go away. For years she didn't feel so bad.Féres didn't need to make a great effort to discover Maleficent's weakness. The fairy's love for that princess was immense, as well as her jealousy. No. It wasn't jealousy, but a disease! Although she sought to disguise the best possible way, he realized how she writhed inside when saw Aurora only talking with a man.For being very beautiful, she called the attention of men and it seemed to kill the fairy inside. Never in his life he could imagine that Maleficent, the most powerful person in the world and even able to cause the total annihilation of all living beings on Earth, was so insecure!"My plan will be perfect!"After shaping metal several times, finally his gun was ready. Floating in front of him was a black thorn with just over ten centimeters length shinning ominously. It was exactly what he needed."It's incredible!" His vanity was at its peak because only the most powerful, strong and experienced wizards, fairies and witches could make such enchantment.Taking great care, he put the thorn in a small silver box to keep the enchantment intact. He also picked up a crystal bottle with a clear liquid such as water, an essential potion for the proper functioning of his plan.When leave his work room, he went to the throne room and called some servants, who came bringing various types of swords. After looking at each one, he chose a sword with extravagant look studded with semi precious gemstones. Despite the appearance, was a simple and low-quality sword, but pretty enough to fool that idiot little king."Tell the stupid little king that we'll go to the continent tomorrow morning." He spoke to a servant then said to another. "You know what to do. I'll be waiting in my quarters. Don't delay!"Philip was very excited to know his victory was very close. He just didn't understand why Féres wanted Aurora, but it didn't matter. After fulfilling the mourning time, he intended to seek another wife and everything was going to be fine.Of course he was very worried about Maleficent. The last time he tried to strike her heart, the sword fell burned to the ground and he was publicly humiliated. The only thing that calmed him was know Féres was much more powerful than those three fairies together."Curious... if he can defeat Maleficent, why didn't do it before?" The young king asked eating a bunch of grapes. That question bothered him a little, but he tried to drive away these doubts believing Féres just didn't want to do that, but could do if he wanted to. "Still... I wonder what, exactly, he wants with Aurora."It was very strange since the wizard didn't seem to be in love with the princess. What more could he want with her?Féres looked at his hands and saw the smooth and beautiful skin wrinkling slowly. He touched his face with fingers and felt several grooves appearing on his face, leaving him desperate. Fortunately he heard the sound of the bedroom door opening and closing, a signal the relief was under way.He went into the small entrance hall of the bedroom and saw, standing near the door, a girl with little more than fifteen years and of rare beauty. She could easily be mistaken for a nymph or maybe a fairy."Come to me, child." He said making a gentle gesture with hands.The girl shook with fear, wondering what the man wanted with her. His appearance caused her disgust and it was very difficult to obey his order."Very well, don't be afraid. Hmm... you're very beautiful. So young! So full of life! Come closer so I admire your beauty."When the girl came close, he contemplated her face for a few seconds admiring every part of her perfection. Then, without warning, he grabbed her neck with both hands. The girl tried to scream, but no voice came out. She tried to struggle to break free of that iron grip that stifled her."Don't fight, it is useless! Now give your life for me!" He said like a hungry wolf in front the prey. A kind of white steam came out of her eyes and mouth, being eagerly absorbed by Féres.He inhaled that steam with a desperate hunger, as if his life depended on it. She felt the air out of lungs and gradually the limbs no longer obeyed. Her vision blurred, the sounds disappeared and she felt as if something was being ripped out of her bowels.Gradually, her body turned only a dry and brittle shell which was thrown to the ground like garbage.Féres took a breath and was to look himself in the mirror, very pleased with what he saw."Better. Much better! "He said admiring his beautiful body and approving every detail. But it was temporary and he knew very well. That girl just had vital energy to keep him feed by four, maybe five months. It was only a matter of time before he needs a new prey.But he wasn't worried. His new prey was on the way and thanks to the gift of beauty given by the fairies, she had enough vital energy to keep him fed for at least thirty years.With a wave of a hand, he made the image of Aurora appeared in the mirror and admired her with great hungry."Soon, my sweet Aurora, we shall meet!" 

"Oh, don't do drama! You know I need to visit my parents. They're very worried!""Can not you postpone this visit? Wait my next travel!" Maleficent said showing visible displeasure."Your next travel will be in many weeks. Until then my parents died with worry. It's only three days, you'll survive. Ah, don't be so! I'll be back before the sunset of the third day, as always."Maleficent took a deep breath trying to keep self-control and said."Not a minute more! I do not like to be away from you." She looked at the other side somewhat embarrassed for having spoken the last sentence, which was said unintentionally. Aurora gave a big hug and kissed her lips tenderly, making the fairy calm down."Hey, don't worry! I'll be back and we'll be together."Maleficent hugged her back and kissed her again feeling something strange in heart, an anguish she couldn't explain. It was as if she was afraid of losing her, which was rationally absurd."Then go, you really need to see your parents. I will be waiting."They said goodbye with another kiss and Aurora used one of the green stones to teleport to the palace.Alone in their bedroom, Maleficent put a hand on chest trying to soften that unpleasant sensation. Something was about to happen and she could feel.Stefan and Leah looked suspiciously at Philip, who stood before them with a chest full of gold and precious stones. That sudden gesture was very odd, as well as his visit without notice."Please accept this small gift as an apology and also a proof of my good will!" He said humbly trying to soften the heart of the king and queen and thus make them forget that terrible day."I appreciate your good will, King Philip, but what do you want with it?" Stefan asked stroking his beard."Redeem me for my cowardice, your Majesty. What I did was inexcusable and I hope one day to have your forgiveness."The king thought for a moment and said."It is not me you should apologize but to Aurora.""I'm willing to kneel before her if necessary. Nothing causes me more pain than to have lost my beloved bride of such a cowardly way!"He seemed so sincere that gradually Stefan and Leah were softening. And looking closer, they saw Felipe had matured. He looked stronger, manly and fearless. There would still be chances of convince Aurora to marry him? Of course, there was Maleficent, who could be a problem. Except if this time he could defeat her."As you know, Aurora lives in Maleficent's castle. She will visit us today, but will have to come back.""It is very sad to know that our daughter lives with that evil fairy!" Leah said."All I need is a second chance. So I'll fight to free Aurora from Maleficent. Or I'll die trying!" He said firmly and with conviction, leaving the royal couple admired with such bravely. He had changed a lot!"The problem," the king spoke again. "is Aurora to say she likes to live with Maleficent, what is absurd!""If you allow, I'll talk with Aurora."The couple looked at each other for a few seconds and he asked."What makes you think will change her mind?""I'll open my heart and explain everything to her. Don't worry, your Majesty, she'll give up to live with that evil fairy in a few hours! If I don't, you can cut off my head!""We do not need to get to that point! Your gesture of good will is enough. Well... if you convince Aurora, I will give my blessing to this marriage."The king didn't notice a wicked gleam in young king's eyes. Everything was going according to plan.In a deep place in the forest which was around the castle, Féres watched the image of Maleficent reflected on the waters of a lake. The fairy was very anxious and apprehensive, which made her a very easy target for his spell. Just one coup de grâce was enough to make her heart become totally vulnerable."I hope that idiot little king does his part." The mage whispered. For the plan to work, everything had to be synchronized.Aurora looked at Felipe trying to disguise the disgust and revulsion. What that miserable coward was doing there? Why didn't the guards kick him out? And why her parents were so kind and gentle with him? What nasty!"Princess Aurora, what a pleasure to see you!" He said kissing her hand gently. His lips barely touched her skin and Aurora pulled her hand abruptly."Hello." She said dryly and showing no willing to talk. The purpose of her visit was to see her parents and show them she was fine."Daughter, look at the manners!" Her mother chided her gently. "Prince Philip came here especially to see you."It was oppressive her parents trying to push that bastard down her throat. She wanted to spend time with them, but that idiot was always around trying to win her back with those fake gestures of kindness.What frustrating! Try as he might, Aurora always fled from his approach, showing clearly she didn't want him around. Fortunately, he had the Féres's plan. If he couldn't win the princess' heart honestly, then there was no other option but to cheat.When the banquet was served, the king and the queen chatted excitedly weaving praise for Philip and how he had progressed. Aurora heard trying to disguise boredom."Do you accept wine? " Philip asked politely."I'm sorry, but I don't drink wine.""It's a special occasion!""For me, it's just a visit to my parents."She ended the conversation and kept sipping her glass of water. What the hell! Why that princess was so stubborn? Well... time to play dirty. Without anyone seeing, Philip muttered something at lutist's ear and he began to sing a song for Aurora. He played well and sang in tune, which was a surprise to everyone. Aurora listened to him without paying attention to Philip.Taking advantage of this distraction, he uncorked a small crystal bottle and poured the liquid in her glass of water. Done. That was all he needed. The lutist also sang other songs, earning applause from everyone."Wow, he improved a lot!" Said the princess impressed and, under the anxious gaze of Philip, took a sip of water along with Féres's potion.After the banquet, the guests gathered for a dance. Aurora watched them feeling the head a little strange. It was as if her thoughts were confused and jumbled."Can I have this dance?""I... I..." no, she didn't want, but something was happening to her body, which suddenly no longer obeyed her.Totally against her will and unable to fight, she accepted the hand extended to her, being led in the middle of the hall. Stefan and Leah watched delighted the couple dancing happily. Aurora finally decided to accept Philip!"The first phase of the plan has been completed." Féres said seeing the couple dancing through the image of the lake. He had used the last bottle of strongest, powerful and unfailing love potion that existed in the world.This potion was the only one which could work with the princess, since common potions generally didn't work with who felt true love for another person. The potion only controlled her body to make it look like she was in love with Philip. Inside, she still hated him. So the enchantment was fragile and anything could break it. The best solution was to leave Aurora isolated as much as possible."Leave her isolated? Isn't this radical?" asked Philip when Féres gave him the potion and explained how it worked."The effect of this potion won't last forever. Aurora hates you and it makes even harder to keep the spell. Any wrong gesture on your part can ruin everything."At least the idiot little king had managed to make her take the potion. The next step was Maleficent to see them together so that he could use his thorn."Would you like to walk in the garden?" Philip invited. Aurora wanted to say no, but her lips didn't obey. Her mind was confused, blurred and she couldn't think straight."It's a very pleasant night." He insisted and finally she agreed.They walked among the flowers and Aurora had strange and conflicting feelings. She didn't want the proximity of that man, but her body wanted something different and disobeyed her all the time. The more she tried to resist, the more her mind became a confusing tangle of thoughts.Seeing that they were alone, Philip held her hand and asked."Aurora, will you marry me?"Normally, she'd have slapped his face because of this absurd request. But her reasoning was slow and compromised because of the potion. And that strange and unpleasant attraction she felt for him seemed to undermine all her strength. She didn't want. A voice inside her screamed 'no' incessantly, like a prisoner trying to get rid of the shackles. However, her lips had own will and talked without she could control them."Yes, Philip, I agree to be your wife."Glad to see his plan succeed, he kissed her lips, ignoring the tears that flowed from her eyes. Tears of fear and desperation of a trapped person.Upon arriving at the castle, Maleficent was received joyfully by Oscar."Greetings, little one. Aurora not arrived yet, is not it?" The dragon shook his head. Well... there was no reason to be sad because Aurora was going to come back in two days. Ah, it was so hard to stay away from her!Maleficent went to her quarters feeling very depressed and unhappy."I am fine, do not worry. You know I hate being away from Aurora."The worst part was the sleep time because her bed was going to be colder that night. Unless..."Um... I think a night visit will not hurt anyone, right?" She smiled with the good idea. Aurora had her own bedroom and they could be together with all privacy. So, before sunrise, she left the palace and no one would know about her visit. She was a genius!"Heavens! This is so sudden! "Stefan said astonished at the quick change of Aurora. How Philip was able to convince her so quickly?"But that's what we want. If Your Majesty allows it." Philip said shrewdly. Without king's approval, nothing could be possible.Féres saw, with satisfaction, Maleficent appears in the Aurora's bedroom. She was about to find out about the wedding and it was going to leave her vulnerable to his attack."Strange... she's delaying... Well, she may be talking with parents a little more. I hope she does not take too long!"She sat on the edge of the bed waiting for the princess. A few minutes passed and her short patience couldn't bear to wait any longer. What was happening? Why was Aurora taking so long? As could no longer wait, she decided to take a look and figure out what the princess was doing."Very well! It's time!" Said Féres with the thorn ready. "She'll never know what hit her!"Unnoticed, she went to the throne room and watched it all from behind a pillar feeling her heart being torn apart. Was that really happening? Wouldn't it just a nightmare?Where she was, Maleficent saw the king congratulating Aurora and Philip by marriage. Marriage? What the hell was going on? How Aurora accepted to marry that idiot? Why did she do it? This time there was no room for doubt. Her eyes didn't lie. Aurora was arm in arm with Philip, happy and smiling. She was awake, lucid and aware of her actions.Maleficent closed her eyes tightly, trying to control the urge to there and demand explanations from Aurora, or fry that bastard. Maybe both.Féres watched her and when she placed a hand over the chest trying to control the pain, he took action. The thorn disappeared, reappearing in the Maleficent's chest and was spiked slowly into her heart. The fairy didn't notice because her heart hurt so much that the additional pain didn't caught her attention."That's perfect. Her heart is vulnerable now." He smiled relieved and hoping the fairy lost control and tried to attack Philip. If that happened, he had only to plunge the sword into her heart to end it all.But she didn't. Despite the pain, anger, hurt, sadness and despair, Maleficent didn't dare to do anything. If attacked Philip, she could hurt Aurora and she didn't want that. She didn't want to see the princess crying and shaking with fear any more. So she disappeared while could still keep the sanity. Staying there was going to worsen her pain and she couldn't stand to see her princess happy by the side of that idiot. Her life was over, all the good she had was sucked until remain only darkness and gloom. She lost her only love and there was nothing to do but grieve over her pain forever.It was nearly two in the morning and Philip walked through the woods trying to protect himself from the cold. That unpleasant to leave his warm bed!"Looks like you succeeded, little king." A voice said and Féres appeared before him."Yes, I did. I mean... almost everything. Aurora drank the potion, agreed to marry me and her parents consented. But Maleficent didn't appear.""Don't worry about her now. You must get married tomorrow or, at most, the day after tomorrow."The man was startled."Are you crazy? The king will never agree to that! There's a real protocol to be followed! First must be done a party to announce the engagement, after..." Féres made a gesture of impatience."Idiot! You don't have much time! The potion that bewitches Aurora will only last a few days. When the effect wear off, she'll kick your ass like a piece of trash!""How do I convince the king to make a marriage so fast? He may listen to Aurora, but you said to keep her isolated...""She must be isolated from everyone, don't give in at this point! As for the king and the queen, oh, how sad! I'll have to do the heavy work because you're an incompetent!"Philip struggled to not give a rough answer and Féres continued."Talk to Stefan and I'll do the rest. The marriage must happen as soon as possible. Two or three days later, we'll forge the accident that will kill the king, the queen and supposedly Aurora. I'll take her with me and you'll be the new king."Knowing he was so close to taking the kingdom made his mood improve and he agreed willingly. Everything was going very well.After Philip left, Féres looked the lake and saw Maleficent in her lab dipped in mourning. What a pathetic thing! And worrying as well. His plan could only work if she attacked Philip and he struck her heart with the sword. He knew it wasn't going to kill her permanently. As had happened before, she was going to resurrect again.Maleficent was a force of nature and necessary for the balance. Killing her meant killing the entire planet and he never wanted that. Living on a dead planet would be unpleasant for him. He just wanted her to disappear for a while, so he could suck all Aurora's life without the fairy finding out. Then, when she resurrected, she was going pursue only Philip, who was about to be the object of her total anger. That stupid little king didn't know what was waiting for him!That was why he did not intend to attack her directly. If she found out he was around, Maleficent could kill him in the worst possible way. And her fertile and sick imagination was always able to imagine the most horrendous ways of torturing and killing someone. She never accepted his way of life and he always felt wronged about it. Why would the fairy care about the life of some girls and boys? This was none of her business.Still he didn't dare to fight her. She was the chaos, destruction and death and no one could defeat such a creature. But he could play dirty to achieve his goals and the enchanted thorn was the perfect weapon. The thorn left her heart vulnerable, because took advantage of a loophole opened by her mistrust and hurt. She didn't trust Aurora and let herself be blinded by jealousy. This left her heart weak and the thorn could be nailed, something that would never be possible if her heart were intact. It was a very complicated and laborious plan, but the reward was worth double that work."Oh, Oscar, what happened? I wish you could talk..." Emma said to the little dragon. For all she knew, Maleficent was locked in her lab and didn't want to talk to anyone. This was a bad sign.What had happened? Did Aurora became angry at her nightly visit? This made no sense. The quarrels between them had greatly diminished, although there were occasional arguments. Anyway, they were going very well.But something had happened and Emma didn't dare talk to Maleficent. When she was like that, the fairy could become more dangerous than usual.Locked in her lab and huddled in a corner, Maleficent struggled with all her strength not to go crazy, break into the palace and take Aurora by force. She wanted her princess back and nothing else mattered. Why her heart insisted on keeping to love someone who betrayed her? Why she couldn't hate Aurora? Of course, because she was a fool.Love left people stupid and pathetic. She had become vulnerable, weak and silly and there was nothing she could do. It was a weakness of which she couldn't escape. Her biggest weakness.Yes, she always thought the love was a weakness. That was why she never allowed herself to fully express her feelings because didn't want other people seeing her weakness. But she had lost Aurora. What to do? Let her marry him? Go after her and beg?"No! I will never beg anything to anyone!" She yelled throwing a thunderbolt against a wall. However great her despair, she would rather die than beg something to someone. But live with that agonizing feeling massacring her heart was the best way?Was it worth keeping the pride and live miserable for life?

"How absurd! We take care of this girl since she was a baby and now we can not talk to her?" Flora cried sputtering pink with her wand. Philip remained adamant."I'm sorry, but she needs to rest for our wedding."(Merryweather)"Why did you decide to get married so quickly? The royal protocols...""The royal protocols are worthless when there's true love!"The three fairies looked at him very angry, not believing a single word that asshole was talking about. True love? Since when? And why Aurora left Maleficent to marry someone who acted so cowardly in their engagement party?(Fauna) "We are her fairy godmothers and want to make the wedding dress.""No need to worry about it. She already has a wedding dress."The fairies was outraged and furious for having been forgotten. They wanted to talk to Aurora, understand why she was doing it and what had happened to Maleficent. It's very strange that the fairy hasn't come to dismember Philip piece by piece. Maybe she didn't know about the wedding yet and they decided it was time to tell her."We need to go, girls, no wasting time!" Flora ordered and they quickly disappearing, reappearing in the Maleficent's castle. Without being seen, they looked for Emma, who was also very worried."You came! What's happening to Aurora?"They told about the wedding, which was scheduled for the next day, and the maid didn't believe."This is absurd! Aurora hates this man and would never marry him!"(Flora) "We know, but we heard she was very happy and said, before her parents and the court, that wanted to marry him!""There's something wrong!"(Fauna) "Where is Maleficent? We need to talk to her right now!"The eastern young woman lowered the head."She's locked in her laboratory. When this happens, she doesn't talk to anyone."(Merryweather) "Then she will talk with us right now! Take us to the laboratory!"Sitting at the table, she drew incessantly oblivious to everything around her. The drawings were the only things left for her. Only drawings. That was all she could have from Aurora."I never told you how beautiful you are and how I love the red of your lips..." she spoke contemplating her new drawing for a while and then put it on the wall along with several others. Some were only with Aurora. Others, she had drawn them embraced and happy. Some included Oscar, showing the picture of what could be a happy family.Family... Did Aurora agreed to marry Philip to have a family? It was one of the very few things that her, despite being the most powerful fairy in the world couldn't give. A normal family. A couple with children."I could have given you the sky and the stars! I could have given you the sea! Why do not you want me?" she said aloud to the drawings, feeling ridiculous and pathetic. If saw anyone in that situation, she'd have felt great revulsion and disgust. "I want you! I love you! What else can I do to show my feelings?"One thing was sure. Aurora didn't accept how she was. Even doing great effort to change, Maleficent could never be a sweet, romantic and sensitive person who the princess wanted. Perhaps that was why she chose the idiot prince. He could at least pretend to have these qualities, thing the fairy couldn't do.And she wished she could do that."She's in there, but I don't dare to enter!" Emma said feeling fear. "Please don't tell her I showed it.""Do not worry, dear. We will talk with her from fairy to fairy. She has to do something!"They entered the lab using magic, which wasn't easy, and found Maleficent before a large wall replete with drawings, all about Aurora. They had never seen her that way and were concerned about her appearance. She wasn't wearing the big cape, just the pink dress she wore underneath and her hair was loose and disheveled. And she was paler than usual, with big circles under her eyes . "Maleficent, we need to talk!" Flora said after taking courage and several thunderbolts were fired in their direction."Go away! I do not want to talk to anyone!" The woman screamed uncontrollably. Fairies deviated from the rays and Merryweather said very angry."You idiot! Aurora will marry Philip tomorrow and you lose time with lamentations?""You came here just to tell me that? I know she left me for that bastard! What do you want me to do? She has chosen him!"More rays were thrown, destroying new furniture she had purchased for her lab. She only stopped when the fairies were in front the drawings, only thing she didn't want to destroy."Maleficent, listen to us!" Fauna began. "Philip isolated Aurora and does not let anyone talk to her, nor us! Something is very wrong!""Go away!"(Flora) "You stupid, Aurora loves you and proved it many times! Why can you doubt about her love?""Because she has decided to marry that jerk without even having the decency to tell me the truth!"(Merryweather) "Goddess, I thought you were more intelligent than that! Do you think Aurora would do such a thing? So you do not know her!""I know very well what I saw!"(Fauna) "You know as well as us that not everything is what it seems! You gave up too easily without even talking to Aurora!""Why should I talk to her? To hear she loves that bastard and wants to marry him? Go to hell!Aurora was right. Maleficent was terribly stubborn and hardheaded. As much as they tried to argue, the fairy remained adamant and drove them away from there shooting rays. They left the castle very frustrated and not knowing what to do."Is it safe for you to stay here? They can find you!" Féres was comfortably seated in an armchair in the Philip's chambers. It was annoying to have that wizard around, especially since he was sleeping in bed while Philip had to make do with the couch."Do you want me to wait hidden in the woods? I'm not a Gnome!""Of course not, but...""Enough! Order the servants to bring wine and some fruits. This waiting is so boring! ""How did you manage to get her parents to accept the marriage so easily? ""I'm very powerful, little king! Never forget that.""And about Maleficent? I think she'll show up on wedding day. She loves to ruin parties! ""Yes, yes... she has a very unique style. Don't worry. Shoot the sword as I taught you and everything will be finished. This plan is perfect!"Aurora looked at her reflection in the mirror, as if looking for something. It was true she was going to marry Philip? When was this decided? Why she accepted this marriage? Her head began to ache again, shuffling her reasoning.She felt chained, tied, as if her heart wanted one thing but the body wanted another. She wanted to scream, break everything around and go back to Maleficent. But her body remained still in the same place as a marble statue. The only thing she could do was cry and the tears flowed freely. They were tears of despair, fear, anguish and dread. A voice inside her screamed for help and no one listened. The few people who came into her room to bring food just smiled to her and congratulated by marriage, totally ignoring the despair which killed her heart."Maleficent..." her lips murmured after a monumental effort. "Maleficent... Ma..." it was as if something had closed her mouth, preventing that name was pronounced. She could only mutter in thought."What is it? We can not enter the palace!" Flora cried when they slammed into an invisible barrier that prevented their approach.(Merryweather) "Someone does not want us here! But who?"(Fauna) "Philip is not able to do that kind of magic. Someone is helping him. What do we do now?"Flora didn't know what to answer. Her only hope was to sneak in Aurora's chamber and talk to her, but her plans were foiled by that damn barrier. That magic was very powerful and only Maleficent could break that barrier. This, of course, if she hadn't sunk in depression and self-pity. Who could imagine a human woman could leave her in pieces like that?Féres looked fairies through the window of Philip's chambers. No way he could let them reach the palace before the marriage ended. If they saw Aurora, they could instantly realize she was under a spell and release her, which would be a disaster for his plan."Maleficent... Maleficent..." a whisper reached her ears, causing her eyes opened immediately. For a moment she heard Aurora calling her name. A surge of hope flooded her heart making her think the princess could have regreted of that miserable decision and came back to her. Nothing. There was no one in that empty laboratory and the drawings didn't speak.She closed her eyes, overcome with fatigue, and leaned across the table again. Minutes later, she fell asleep."Maleficent... help..." That made her open the eyes quickly, looking around. What was that strange place?Suddenly, she was no longer in her laboratory. That dark and cool place looked like a kind of endless corridor. In front of her, there was only darkness. Great walls of dark stone rose on both sides and behind her, showing she could only move on. The whispers was increasingly weak."Aurora? Is you? Where are you?" She yelled walking quickly, eager to find the end of that corridor."Malef..." the word was cut in half, indicating she was the limit of strength. She was in danger! Her princess was in danger and needed help. It didn't matter if she was hurt or heartbroken. That should be forgotten for a while.The important thing was to find Aurora and save her from whatever it was. The rest didn't matter. If she wanted to go back to her, great! She'd be welcomed with open arms, without complaints and reprimands. Otherwise, if she wanted to stay with that idiot prince, Maleficent was willing to accept even if that meant shatter her heart. But for now, she just wanted to save her beloved Aurora.Thinking so, she ran as fast as could though run wasn't her best skill. She ran, calling for Aurora frantically. The darkness around was becoming larger and larger until she couldn't see the walls, but a large dark and empty space. Not totally dark, not totally empty. Not far from there, she saw a little light and came closer."Aurora! What happened?" She asked anxiously trying to get close to the young woman who was down on knees, as if was totally exhausted and weak. Thick chains covered her body, preventing any movement. "I will get you out of there right now!""Maleficent... help... help me... I need you... I..."Without thinking twice, the fairy ran to rescue Aurora and suddenly a flash almost blinded her eyes. She woke up panting, sweating and heart pounding heavily. What kind of dream was that?Preparations were almost ready and the guests had arrived. As the marriage have been scheduled by very short notice, few people were able to attend and everyone thought it was strange the king allow a so sudden marriage. Nasty comments was made, wondering why the princess had to marry so quickly. After all, a royal wedding always took too long to be well prepared.Stefan and Leah were a kind of hypnosis, so didn't reason about what they were doing. They just approved the preparations. In his quarters, Philip wore new clothes feeling a little apprehensive. He knew Maleficent was going to try kill him during the ceremony. Although Féres have assured that everything would be easy, he still felt afraid."Fear and doubt are for the weak." A voice spoke quietly and he looked at the wizard who seemed very distracted admiring the royal gardens through the window. "She'll come and you'll be ready. That's enough."Philip returned to take care of his clothes trying to look calm. After all, everything was so well planned that there was no chance to fail. Yet he felt a strange discomfort.Maleficent walked from one side to another feeling her heart beat wildly. That dream meant something and she knew it. Aurora was in danger! But what kind of danger? Did that damn Philip was keeping her prisoner? The fairies had spoken something about that. Aurora could be being coerced or blackmailed! Why hadn't she thought of this before?The vision of Aurora chained and powerless to react didn't get out of her mind. No, there was something wrong! In a snap, everything that had happened to her from Georgei's spell until the moment she ate ambrosia came to her memory. Aurora was always with her even in the worst moments. The princess could have given it up, could have married with Aragon and became the queen of a rich and powerful king.She could have come back to the palace where it was safe and comfortable. But no. Aurora didn't go away and didn't give up her even in the worst crises. When Maleficent was at rock bottom, defeated, weak, without powers or riches, Aurora remained faithful to her side. She was patient, understanding, companion, loving and protective. She always forgave and accepted her back even after the worst behaviors.For her, Aurora left the parents, the palace, life as a princess and a chance to marry and have a normal life. She even risked her own life to save hers! That could only mean one thing: Aurora loved her. Maleficent then felt ashamed of herself. How could she doubt about her love? How could she cowardly fled and locked herself in that laboratory dipping into lamentation and self-pity? How pathetic!The idiots fairies were right. Not everything was as it seemed to be. Apparently Aurora seemed to accept marry spontaneously, but something may have happened and she was going find out anyway. She needed to talk to the princess and know what was happening. She needed answers."Aurora loves me and I have no doubt about that. It is me she loves, no that idiot king!" The woman shouted with various rays and green fire coming out of her hands. "I trust her! I trust her!" She repeated a few more times, because trust was essential that that relationship work. She was loved and had absolutely sure of it.A strange glow came out from her chest, catching her by surprise, and something fell on the floor making a metallic noise. It was a big black thorn that she took with a trembling hand. After examining the object for a few seconds, her lips tightened with anger, lots of anger. More anger than she had felt for Georgei, more anger than she felt for anything else. Everything was very clear to her.A menacing growl came from her throat and her eyes glowed demonically showing all her anger. She knew who had done that thorn and why, which raised her hatred to unimaginable levels."Féres..."The throne room wasn't exactly full, since there was no time to invite people who lived in other kingdoms and distant places. Only nobles of the kingdom, aristocrats and rich merchants was there. The servants had made a beautiful decoration and the orchestra was ready to play soft music for the guests.From the outside, the fairies were still trying to overcome that barrier and enter, but they were exhausted and weak. Did everything was going to end that way? There was no hope?In her quarters, two maids helped Aurora to put the wedding dress while another combed her hair. Her face apparently looked so peaceful and serene as a porcelain doll. Inside, however, a whirlwind of despair, anguish and horror rolled incessantly. She screamed and struggled, cried, begged and roared with rage. No one could hear her pleas. Nor Maleficent. Why didn't she come?Maybe she didn't know what was happening yet. The fairy was going only realize that something was wrong when she didn't come back at sunset of the third day. How many days have passed? She didn't know. All her sense of time was jeopardized. It could have been only a few hours, but could have been several days or months. Her head ached and throbbed when trying to form coherent thoughts. She could just struggling like a beast trapped in a cage. Just inside."Your Highness is beautiful!""Philip is a very lucky man!"The maids talked around her and she just smiled. Nobody saw that her eyes were opaque and her gaze was vague and blurry. No one noticed her despair.Received as a guest and friend of King Philip, Féres joined the other guests drawing everyone's attention for his unusual beauty. How he loved to be admired! Being young, beautiful, have a perfect face and body, was one of the most important things in his life. And after absorb all the vital essence of Aurora, his beauty was going to be kept for many years.Some young maidens admired him and he saw that there were many beautiful women in this kingdom. It was is a good possibility to be considered!The sound of music brought him out of his reverie. The ceremony was about to begin. First came the king and the queen, soon after Philip richly dressed in velvet and silk. In a sheath hanging from his waist, was the sword he intended to use to kill Maleficent if she decided to appear.Then the big moment. Aurora entered the throne room wearing a long pink and white dress. Everyone was amazed at her beauty and Féres looked at her like a beast stared at his prey. So much beauty! So much life!When she approached Philip, he gently reached out and the ceremony began. The king celebrated the wedding and everyone were silently. Philip had a big smile of victory on his face, while Aurora desperately screamed inside. A few tears ran through her eyes and her body trembled. Thinking it was just strong emotion, Stefan didn't interrupt the ceremony."King Philip, you accept the princess Aurora as your legitimate wife to love, honor, and trust her, in sickness and in health, in adversity and prosperity, and to be true and loyal to her so long as you both shall live?""I accept." He replied firmly."Princess Aurora, you accept the King Philip as your legitimate spouse to love, honor, and trust him, in sickness and in health, in adversity and prosperity, and to be true and loyal to him so long as you both shall live?""I... I..." her lips trembled. No, she didn't accept. She didn't want to marry that bastard."Princess Aurora?" Her father called again. "Daughter?"She clenched her fists in anger, feeling coming into boiling inside. Her revolt reached its peak and she fought with all her strength. No matter if her head ached violently. No matter if something seemed to roll inside causing a searing pain that made her bend over herself. She didn't wasn't going to say "accept" not even if her life depended on it."Daughter? What happened? Say just 'I accept' and done!" her father spoke and Aurora shouted angrily."No, I don't accept! I hate this man! I hate him!"Her voice echoed through the throne room, leaving everyone stunned. The orchestra stopped playing, Philip turned pale as wax, her mother was on the verge of fainting and Féres got desperate. How that woman managed to break free of the potion?"Aurora, what is going on? You said before me and your mother...""I must have been crazy, delusional, I don't know! But I'm not going to marry this bastard! I won't! Maleficent! Where's Maleficent? I want her! I love her!"The princess screamed insane and Philip tried to hold her, claiming that it was just an attack of hysteria caused by the strong emotion of the wedding."Let me go now!" She roared scratching and spitting in his face. "Try to control yourself and let's end this marriage!""I don't want! Maleficent!"A green glow shone before them."Let her go right now or I will do you in pieces!" a voice said, making everyone to freeze in fear.

Maleficent walked toward the throne and her eyes sparkled with pure rage when saw Féres among the guests. That man was doomed, definitely doomed! He noticed her gaze and was terrified. What had happened to the thorn that was spiked in her heart? How she was able to remove it? Heavens! The plan had failed miserably! Without the thorn, Philip would never be able to strike her heart with the sword. Everything was lost and he saw no other option but to flee as fast as possible while he still could.She didn't care because expected him to flee like a rat when the ship sank. She was there for Aurora."Maleficent!" Aurora cried trying to run towards the fairy, but Philip grabbed her arm."Will you trade me for this... freak? Aurora, heavens! She isn't even human! How can you?"The princess looked at him gritting her teeth and a punch was struck straight into his face, causing him to fall to the ground. She threw out the bridal bouquet, took out the ornament of the head and rushed to Maleficent falling into her arms."Maleficent, I didn't want to marry him, I swear! Please, trust me!" She spoke crying while hugging the fairy with full force, feeling great fear of losing her. After all, she had every reason to believe she had been betrayed and that time there were no excuses or justifications. But to her surprise, the fairy hugged her tightly."Of course I trust you, Aurora." She said softly.For a time, she watched the ceremony without being seen and understood everything. Aurora wasn't acting sane. Féres gave her a potion powerful enough to control her body and make seem she was in love with someone who hated. But the potion failed to subdue the love Aurora felt for her and that was the ultimate proof Maleficent needed to make sure she was loved."Aurora! What is happening?" Stefan asked without understand why his daughter was hugging Maleficent like that. Unless...Philip drew the sword and yelled with his face red with rage."Your freak! I'll end your life now!" He ran toward Maleficent with incredible speed, catching everyone by surprise. The only thing the fairy had time to do was take Aurora out of his way by pushing her aside."Philip, no! Stop! "Aurora screamed raising to stop him. Too late. He was very quick and dealt a blow to Maleficent's heart. Everyone shouted, some covered their eyes, others fainted.He just stared, horrified, the sword clashing against a kind of barrier that protected Maleficent's heart and falling burnt to the ground. The failure of that day repeated again. A wicked laughter echoed in the air and a green fire came from Maleficent's hands."You worthless little king! Did you think you could defeat me? I am invincible! Now you will pay dearly for what you did to Aurora."Stefan tried to intervene on behalf of his ex-future son in law."Please do not hurt him! He just wanted to be a good husband for my daughter!""A good husband for your daughter? He used a potion to hypnotize her!"The king was in shock for a while and then turned to Philip."Is that true? Have you bewitched my daughter?"He tried to defend himself."It's a lie! Of course it's a lie, I'd never do that! This creature is trying to put everyone against me! Please believe me. Majesty! Aurora! I love you!" the idiot still tried to touch her heart."But I don't love you and never will. Leave me alone!""I can be a perfect husband, I can give you children!""I don't want a husband and children! I'm very happy with Maleficent and intend to stay so!""Please..."A bolt of lightning was shot in his direction, then another."Go away your filthy worm! Go back to your kingdom with tail between your legs and never set foot here again, else..." another ray was fired hitting him and turning his beautiful clothes into rags. She wasn't there to play.Without other choice, Philip ran away crying and being booed by all guests, as had happened before. Happy to have everything finished, Aurora hugged Maleficent again and to her surprise, the fairy didn't seem bothered by that public display of affection. But of course her parents and all members of the court couldn't believe their eyes."Aurora, my daughter..." Stefan began to speak and the words died in his throat."It is true that you... you..." Leah also tried to talk and failed. Aurora held Maleficent's hand and said."Throughout my life, I always wanted to be free to follow my own way. I only got it after I met Maleficent. Mom, Dad, I know you want to see me married to a king and giving grandchildren to you, but this isn't the way I want. I'm sorry."The king mumbled a few words and finally said."But she... she isn't even human! And is a woman! This is wrong!""If you think so, I respect. But I don't share your opinion and I know I'm not doing anything wrong. We love each other.""What does she understand about love? She is an evil creature who only causes misfortunes and...""Father, stop it! I won't let you talk to her like that!""Do not worry, Aurora. It is normal for people to think so." The fairy said without being offended, because was used to those insults and condemnations. The important thing was to be accepted by the one she loved. The rest didn't matter."I want my daughter to find someone who loves her..." Leah said with tears in eyes."She has found." A great silence hung in the air and Aurora looked at Maleficent very incredulous. The fairy took a deep breath, gathered courage, overcame her pride and completed. "I love her and if she really wants me, I'll do anything for her to be happy by my side."Aurora came out of that shock and said with tears of joy in eyes."I want! More than anything!""I... I do not know what to say! I can not agree with that!" Stefan was still unable to accept."But if our daughter is happy, then we will learn to accept." Leah said putting a hand on her husband's shoulder. "Daughter, you can follow your way. We will not interfere. Alright dear?"The king pressed his lips, clenched the fists, stuttered a bit and took a deep breath. Finally, he said."That is right, Aurora. Live your life and be happy, is what matters. Just do not forget us and come visit us always. You are still our daughter. I only regret that now we have no successor to the throne..."Prime minister's eyes brightened at once, but the glow soon faded to hear Maleficent saying."Do not worry. The queen is taking care of it now."Dozens of jaws dropped to the floor, Stefan's eyes widened and Leah shivered by placing a hand on her belly."You are saying I am... am...""Pregnant? Yes. Exactly so. I just do not believe you have not noticed even after so many weeks of sickness. He will be a beautiful boy and will rule the kingdom with justice." The sound of something falling on the floor caught the attention of everyone. That was too much for Stefan's nerves."I'll have a little brother! What cute!" Aurora said clapping. "Mom, please don't faint too!""Heavens... I need to sit down! Oh!" The servants rushed to support the queen and also helped the king to his feet.Everyone cheered and clapped when heard that a new heir was under way. The orchestra resumed playing and, feeling better, Stefan ordered to serve the great banquet to celebrate the pregnancy of the queen. There could be no better news for him. Maleficent smiled happy for her spell have been able to overcome Leah's problem of fertility. The chances were very small, but she was successful and the kingdom was going to have have an heir, freeing Aurora from this incumbency.As much as wanted to leave, she agreed to stay for a while because of Aurora. The barrier that protected the palace disappeared and fairies could enter. They cheered of pure joy when knew about Leah's pregnancy and promised to help in the child's upbringing and education. They chattered incessantly, deciding which gifts intended to give the baby the day of his baptism.After the banquet, Aurora had to drag Maleficent to the middle of the room so that they had at least one dance."The world is crazy! Totally crazy! Where are we going to stop?" The king said to see them dancing merrily."Dear, please! Aurora is happy!""The king is right, your Majesty! It is the end of the family!" The prime minister said very upset to see his dreams of inheriting the crown falling apart."Oh, shut up!" Leah said, closing that subject. Although she'd rather Aurora to find a good husband, she was willing to respect her choice.The party went cheerfully and to see that Maleficent had reached her limit, Aurora decided it was time for them to go away. After heartfelt goodbyes, they vanished away leaving behind joy, party, dance and hope for the kingdom."Oh, wonderful!" Aurora said after wear a comfortable nightdress and lie down in bed. "How good to be home!""Home..." Maleficent said lying down beside her. "Aurora, you said home!""Of course! This is my home. Isn't it?"The fairy smiled broadly."As long as you wish, yes. Here is your home.""Then will be forever!"They kissed passionately while caressing one anther's body with anxiety. Before Maleficent lost control of herself, Aurora said."Thank you for trusting in me. I swear I didn't want to marry Philip, but I don't know what happened!""That bastard gave you an extremely strong and powerful potion to control you. It wasn't your fault." Fairy answered kissing her neck with open mouth."But you may have been hurt."Maleficent stopped a little what was doing and looked at Aurora's eyes."At first, yes. I thought I had lost you forever. But then I decided to trust your feelings. I will not lose you because of lack of trust.""Thank you, really!""If you want to thank me, princess, so get rid of this damn nightdress before I turn it into rags!" The fairy said grabbing her again. She didn't want to spend precious time with useless conversation if there were better and more interesting things to do.After a few days, she finally found her target. That miserable worm had managed to hide from her for many years, but he had made the biggest mistake of his life trying to kidnap Aurora. Without anyone seeing, Maleficent took a glass of wine that Féres had used. With that she was able to use her power to find him.Those piercing screams were like music to her ears. Indifferent to all his pain and suffering, Maleficent was doing her act of torture enjoying every moment. Yes, she was still a wicked fairy. Mercy and forgiveness were part of Aurora's personality, but not hers and she didn't intend to have mercy for that man.Féres was naked, hanging from the ceiling by hands tied with thick chains and screamed desperately to see his image reflected in the large mirror. Maleficent wanted him to follow every detail while his beauty was destroyed little by little."Are you enjoying it, dear?" She asked after booting one more piece of skin from his face leaving him completely disfigured. There were cuts, burns and punctures all over his body. She broke bones, pulled teeth, nails, scalped him and cut his ears and nose. And everything slowly so that he felt as much pain as possible. She even splashed salt on the wounds to make them hurt even more. When he fainted, she made him wake up to start all over again. He couldn't even close his eyes because she had cut his eyelids. That was the punishment for what he intended to do with Aurora."Kill me, please! Kill me! I beg you!" The man yelled at the height of despair. Besides not endure so much pain, he'd rather die than live with the body deformed like a monster. With her typical wicked smile, she just said."Calm down, your worm. You will not die."No, Féres wasn't a bit calm because knew Maleficent was able to create worse punishment than death. All that torture was just the beginning and he was aware of it.After cause more pain and suffering in unimaginable ways, Maleficent was tired of playing with that worm and decided to put her second idea into practice. She loosed the chains which tied his hands, making the man fall to the ground still screaming in pain and despair to see his beauty destroyed of the cruelest way possible."Now I will release you. Yes, I am very generous, are not I?" Said that, she threw a great bolt of lightning against his body. All finished, he looked at himself in the mirror and screamed wildly when faced with the ugliest, hideous, disgusting and repulsive creature that any sick imagination could create. That was far worse than any torture, much worse than death!"You will remain so until the end of time!" The fairy began raising hers arms with green fire around. Her strong voice echoed like thunder. "I curse you! I condemn you! I sentence you to the prison without walls!""No, please, no! I'd rather die!"Ignoring his pleas, she continued releasing the curse."You are sentenced to wander as a monster. Everyone will feel disgust and revulsion for you! No matter where you go, no one will give you a unique gesture of compassion and kindness. Only rage, fear, hate! You will forever be treated like a monster until the end of time! And this curse can not be canceled by anyone but myself! You are doomed!"Green fire spread through the room, along with a deafening noise. When it's over, she made him disappear from there to appear anywhere were with people to hate him. Leaving him in the middle of the desert with no one to see was a gesture of mercy he didn't deserve. And to ensure he was going to serve his sentence, she even took away his powers so he couldn't run away or fight back any attack.Unlike Helga, who got a gesture of mercy from Aurora, Féres had nothing. The curse couldn't be broken and he was forced to wander forever as a monster, being disowned, hated and attacked by people. It was a punishment for his excessive vanity that made him take the lives of so many innocent boys and girls.When finished her work, she decided to go leave the castle and treasures for the servants to share between them. She wasn't interested in those crumbs.It was day of great celebration in the royal palace. Everyone of the kingdom and the royalty of the neighboring kingdoms were invited. Stefan didn't save money and gave the biggest party in the whole history of the kingdom to celebrate the christening of Stefan II, his son and heir. He was a beautiful boy with brown hair and blue eyes who filled him with pride.The baby was lying in a crib decorated with gold and covered with the finest silk, surrounded with many gifts. Like any proud mother, Leah watched her gorgeous son feeling the happiest woman in the world. They never imagined that such a thing could happen again and the child was very welcome. After the guests gave their gifts, the trumpets blew announcing the arrival of the three fairies, ready to give their gifts to the baby. Flora was first."Dear Stefan, I grant you the gift of Justice. You will be a righteous king." Then Fauna gave her gift."Small Stefan, I give you the gift of Compassion, so you always govern for the good of everyone!"Finally, it was Merryweather's time to give her gift."I grant you the gift of Courage, for ever defend the welfare of your people no matter what!"Stefan's smile went from ear to ear sure that with those gifts, his son was going to be the best king of all time. When he decided to continue the festivities, a huge green glow shone in the middle of the room, almost causing him to have a heart attack. Not again! His nerves wouldn't stand!Maleficent materialized, along with Aurora and Oscar was perched over fairy's shoulder."Dad, mom! Good to see you! Where is my brother? Oh, he's so cute!" She said holding the baby in her arms. "And has my eyes!""Daughter, we are very happy you came." Leah said. "But... uh...""It is a beautiful baby." She said without much interest. "I think the three silly fairies gave gifts to him, then I can do no less."Merryweather scowled. Silly fairies? Why did this woman have to be so annoying? She just didn't try to fight because Flora held her skirts.Aurora put her brother back to the crib and under terrified gazes from everyone, the wicked fairy approached, looked at him for a few seconds and said."The child will grow up strong, healthy and robust. He will be notable for his intelligence, good sense and wisdom, being able to make the best decisions with maturity and always seeking the good of everyone."Stefan and Leah barely could breathe and just followed everything with wide eyes."But before the sun sets on his sixteenth birthday, he..." the panic was total. The music stopped, the fairies began shoot sparks with their wands, Stefan and Leah almost fainted and the guards were ready to attack."Maleficent!" Aurora scolded with hands on hips. "Behave yourself!"The fairy raised an eyebrow."It is just a joke. Can not I have some fun? Humans are so boring!" She made a soft green glow involve the baby and turned to the royal couple with a wicked smile. It felt so good to torment them! "He will be a great king, do not worry. And also have long life."Finally they were able to breathe relieved and the party ran its course. Heavens! Why did Aurora get involved with that evil fairy?"You're impossible, you know?" Aurora said when Maleficent returned to her side."Yes, I am. And I love it!""And I love to dance. Now!"Fairy's protests was worthless. When Aurora wanted something, she always got."I ca not get used to it." Flora said and Merryweather agreed."Sometimes I feel sorry for her parents. Poor things, they wanted a very different future for their daughter."Fauna shook her head."Parents do not own their children and ca not decide about their lives. Moreover, the kingdom has an excellent heir now. And we have another beautiful baby to care!"The other fairies smiled.(Flora) "How is take care of a boy?"(Merryweather) "It will be so fun! I ca not wait!"They soon forgot Maleficent and Aurora and were planning the tasks which each one was going to have with the small Stefan. They really liked it! "Can we go into the garden?" The fairy asked tired of dancing."Of course. Let's go!"It was a beautiful night and they walked among the flowers hand in hand. There was calm and peace between them, since the quarrels had subsided considerably. There were still problems, setbacks and disagreements that could not be avoided. There was no love without problems and defects. Maleficent still had a difficult temper and living with her was a daily challenge. But they knew could have a good life and be happy together.They sat on a stone bench to look at the starry sky and Maleficent put an arm around Aurora's shoulder."It's such a beautiful night, isn't it?""Yes, very pretty and nice. It is much better here than inside.""Thanks for coming with me. I know you don't like of these social events.""But I like to let everyone terrified with my presence.""You are incorrigible! Please be more careful with my dad! He isn't so young and his heart can't bear.""I will think about it."Aurora laughed and rested her head on the fairy's shoulder, thinking for a while."Is something bothering you?""In thinking about my father, I remembered that people get old and die..."She understood what the princess wanted to say and knew this matter was complicated."One day I'll grow old, I won't be young forever. Will you still feel the same way about me?""Every day, your foolish! I do not care about physical appearance and my feelings for you will not change when you get older.""Will you be sad when I die?"Maleficent grabbed her chin to look into her eyes."Everything in nature born, lives and dies one day, Aurora. But this is an eternal cycle. You will die and be reborn again with a new body and a new name. Death as the end all, does not exist.""Then I'll come back?""Yes. And I will be waiting. You are my half and nothing can change that.""I don't want to change."They kissed soundly and kept looking at the starry sky. Maleficent felt peace and tranquility in heart, which was stronger than ever. She still had not told for Aurora and didn't know if wanted to tell about the real reason for nothing could reach her heart. It was very difficult for someone like her to admit that a feeling, which was once seen as weakness, was the major power that protected her.Yes, the love she felt for Aurora protected her heart from everything. That was her greatest strength, despite her pride constantly protesting against the embarrassment of the most powerful fairy of all, often called the Mistress of Evil, to have a so noble feeling as her greatest protection. Well... she could live with it. Nothing was perfect.The most important thing was to be with Aurora. The rest didn't matter.

Ten years have passed since the christening of small Stefan II, who grew up strong and healthy as Maleficent had said. He was becoming a smart kid, showed great wisdom for his age, cared about people and felt compassion for the unfortunate ones.He was a very restless and adventurous boy, always exploring unknown places of the palace and leaving the fairies concerned with such boldness that sometimes created many confusions that they needed to solve."Stefan, come back here! Oh, heavens! My hair is turning white!" Flora cried flying behind the little boy, who ran gleefully wielding a wooden sword."I'm a knight and I'll save the dragons!""Should not you hunt dragons?" Merryweather said laughing that unusual posture."No! I hunt who hunt dragons! They should be preserved!"(Flora) "This is what happens when we let him spend time with Maleficent! She is misrepresenting his head!""I want to visit Aurora and Aunt Maleficent! When will we to the their castle?""In a week." Fauna said patiently. "Maleficent is traveling now."The boy visited his sister regularly, even though his parents didn't approve much. But he always had fun, learned new things and enjoyed spending time with Maleficent, whom he called aunt despite fairy's protests. Deep down she didn't matter despite her usual scowl. He called her aunt and she called him brat.With them, he was learning to respect differences because had contact with different creatures and new ways of living that he wanted to teach his people one day. He wanted to see people happy and comfortable as who lived in the Forbidden Lands."What I see there? A dragon hunter! Stop right now, your evildoer!" he yelled hitting a large rock with the sword."Stefan, do not climb this rock! It is dangerous!" Fairies shouted and the boy ran again, laughing and swinging the sword.Would it take him a long time for it to grow up? The years passed and the love between Aurora and Maleficent was still strong as ever. Even though ten years older, Aurora didn't show many signs of the time thanks to the gift of beauty that Flora had given her. Still, she knew time was passing, but didn't care because learned the death wasn't the end and one day they were going to meet again.She and Maleficent had discussions from time to time, but the fairy had improved in many things despite not having changed her nature. At least live with her had become easier.Aurora ruled the Forbidden Lands along with Maleficent. She had the same authority as the fairy, was very respected and even had her own throne by the side to Maleficent's. She never cared about not get married and have children and never wanted a wedding ceremony. Maleficent would have done it for her, but they both thought it was silly because the bond between them was so much stronger than the mere formality of a wedding.  Emma married a nobleman of the court, but she was still Aurora's best friends. For services rendered, including helping in times of difficulty, she had also won large sum of gold to live in luxury for life.Baltazar also get married, with an intelligent and skillful young woman who helped him run the businesses. Together they grew and became rich. Sometimes he thought about Helga, but these moments didn't last long once he was very happy with his family. It was just curiosity.But of course not everyone was happy. Helga was still with her horrible appearance and working in pig farms, only place where she could live without being harassed. Her hard and unfeeling heart has ever been able to understand the true meaning of inner beauty, so the spell couldn't be broken.Féres also continued as an aberration and had been captured by the owner of a freak circus, being exhibited every day to people willing to pay to get shocked with the ugliest creature in the world. That was his punishment and he couldn't even resort to death because the curse was up to the end of times. That was going to take quite.Philip was deposed by a coup because his subjects saw how much he was unfit to rule. Bankrupt, without respect and authority, his only alternative was to kill himself by drinking a bottle of a powerful poison. That was the end of his life of failures.Aragon's kingdom was invaded and annexed to a neighboring kingdom who had achieved a strong and powerful army. He was beheaded and his reign came to an end.In her quarters, Aurora was reading a book to rest of her work when small winged creatures appeared flying around. One landed over her shoulder."Oscar, my little baby! How's the family?"The dragon looked at his two cubs feeling very proud. He had found a mate, a female with beautiful blue and white color that enchanted him instantly. Aurora called her Belle, while their cubs were Diablo and Lilith, names given by Maleficent. One was in honor of her crow that was turned into stone."Oh, they're so beautiful!" She said stroking gently the heads of two small dragons that had become used to her company. Belle was still shy because she was wild and didn't know live with humans.The visit didn't last long because Oscar had to take the cubs back to their mother. But she couldn't go back to reading because another person entered the bedroom."You do not want to swap me for this book, do you?" Maleficent said seductively putting a hand inside her cleavage."Um... I don't know... Hey!" The fairy made the princess rise suddenly and pressed her lips against hers.The sound of fabric being torn told her the dress was lost forever. Sometimes, Maleficent had no patience to wait. Aurora didn't matter because had many dresses. And it was so wild and sensual!"Why did my clothes always get destroyed?""Less words and more action. Kiss me!"Aurora couldn't argue and she didn't want. She just handed herself to the love that existed between them. A perfect love even with all its imperfections.The end.It's the end of this long story.
