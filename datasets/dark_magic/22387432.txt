    Danny’s heart pounded in his chest, the sound of his blood pumping filled his ears, his legs cramped as he pushed himself to move faster. His feet were hitting the pavement hard as he ran, water splashing up and coating the bottom of his pants as he turned down an alley, sliding and only barely managing to catch himself as he did.It could have been seconds or minutes that he ran, but it seemed to go on and go. Water was dripping down his face and into his eyes; his lungs were begging for oxygen faster than he could inhale.He slipped in a muddy puddle and caught himself on the brick wall. A loud gasping breath escaping him as he tried to make sense of where he was. The flickering neon sign of a shop at the other end of the alley; the sign read open. Danny dashed for the door, hoping that whoever was inside would help him.As he reached the door, a hand grasped his shoulder, and he was thrown backwards. For a few moments, he was airborne before he crashed onto the wet ground. The water soaking his jacket completely, his body aching from the impact.The low chuckle that caught Danny’s ear made his heart leap into his throat.Standing by the door with the glowing sign was a hooded figure. The same hooded figure that had followed Danny out of the door at the bar. Whoever it was had followed him down the street towards his car, but when he pulled out his keys, they grabbed him. They had slammed him against the door, a harsh hissing noise coming from their mouth before he felt teeth on his neck. The laughing of a couple coming out of another restaurant had distracted it enough for him to run.Danny used what strength he had to push the figure away before running as fast and as hard as he could. His whole body was burning from fleeing; he was panting—trying to breathe—but this figure, this thing, didn’t seem phased at all.They took a step towards him, their head leaning to one side.With a shaking voice, Danny asked, “What do you want from me?”The chuckle was louder. “One thing.” It took a step closer. “The most precious thing of all.”Danny glared at them and tried to push himself up. He stumbled but managed to stand. “What?” he yelled.The figure paused and shifted, the light-catching beneath the hood and lighting up the things eyes. They were bright and blue but not human. The look of need, of hungry, was far from anything remotely human.“The one thing that gives you life,” they said.Danny shook his head and stepped back.But before he could say another word, the thing moved towards him in a blur and razer sharp pain shot through his throat as teeth ripped into his skin. He could feel his blood being pulled towards the mouth latched on his neck and the drops that were running down his shoulder.The soul-piercing scream that came out of Danny didn’t phase the monster. It moaned and held him tighter against his chest. His blood continued to rush through him, slowly making him feel weaker and weaker until it just…stopped.The creature stumbled back, released Danny before letting out its own haunting scream of pain. Its back arched up at an awkward angle as its knees buckled and it trembled on the ground.His knees were too weak to hold him, and he fell to the ground, rolling onto his back and noticing another hooded figure that stood at the end of the alley. This one was different, smaller, thinner, and looked female.She had her hand by her side, her fingers splayed out wide. Her other hand was tucked into the pocket of her jacket.She said, “I wish I could say that I had better things to do than spend my nights hunting abominations like you down—but I don’t.”She twisted her hand, clenched her fingers closed, and a loud crack sounded through the air.Danny turned his head and noticed the creature that attacked him was lying still, slumped on the ground. It’s neck broken.The girl walked over to Danny. She knelt down beside him and placed her hand over the wound on his neck. “You’ll be fine,” she said.Danny frowned. “I don’t understand—”She smiled. “You don’t need to. Tomorrow you will wake up, and this will all be a dream.”Warmth flooded Danny’s throat; it spread across his shoulder and along his torso. The exhaustion he had felt faded, the pain dissipated, and he felt wide awake. Sitting up, he looked at the girl.“What just happened?”She laughed. Her hood fell back slightly as she did. Blonde hair peeked out from beneath the black hood.“I think I owe you a thank you,” said Danny.She smiled and stood. “You are welcome.”Danny pushed himself to stand, brushing off his arms and pants before turning to look at the slumped thing. “What is that?” he asked.The girl smiled. “Nothing you need to worry about.”“Is it dead?”“Technically, yes.”Danny’s eyebrows clenched. “Technically?”“As I said, by tomorrow, you won’t remember, so it doesn’t matter.” She walked over to the thing and kicked it with her foot.“Who are you?” asked Danny.“Alex,” she held out her hand, “the woman who just saved your life.”Danny took her hand. “Thank you, Alex; I’m Danny.”Alex smiled turned soft.A van pulled up behind them; Danny turned surprised, but Alex looked up expectantly. She squeezed the grip on Danny’s hand, causing him to turn back to her, confused.“It was nice to meet you, Danny.”The world started to shift, and Danny felt dizzy. He shook his head to try and shake it off but felt his body become heavy. He stumbled and felt Alex grasp his shoulders as it went black. *** Alex looked down at the man named Danny. He would need to be taken back to his apartment, and while she was almost curious to see what this human did with his time, to be so calm in an almost death situation, she had better things to do.She turned to Kenny, who was leaning over the neutralised vampire. She said, “Kenny, get the stiff in the van and then take the human home.”Kenny nodded. “Sure thing, boss.”Turning to walk over to the van, Alex pulled out her phone and dialled.“That was quick,” said a deep voice.“I’m that good,” said Alex.“I can meet you at the factor on Mane in 40.”Alex smiled. “See you then.”

    Chicago was wet; cold, wet and windy.Winter was possibly Alex’s most hated time of year. She preferred the warmer months, where she could dress in jeans and a t-shirt and not have to worry about frostbite nipping at her skin. Winter in Chicago always required layers; it hadn’t started to snow just yet, but the rain was icing, and the wind was chilling, forcing Alex to rug up.Her original attire had been chosen specifically for a date, with the intention of staying indoors beside the fire and drinking wine. But those plans had been swiftly destroyed by a simple phone call that sent Alex out hunting.It wasn’t that she minded hunting on a Friday night; in fact, she rather enjoyed tracking down and destroying vermin. The thrill got her blood pumping, and the sex after a hunt was always better, almost as good as makeup sex.The shiver that ran through her made Alex pull the hood of her jacket back up to cover her ears. She was standing in an empty drafty factor waiting for her friends to arrive. They were late. She had expected them almost twenty minutes ago, and her patients were growing thin. Alex was tempted to take the job into her own hands and get the information out of the unconscious worm she had tied to a chair herself.Glancing out the frosted window, Alex spotted a familiar white van moving towards the building. She smiled widely before turning to cross the room to stand by the unconscious vampire she had chained up. Spelled and vervain dipped steel chains were bound around the throat, chest, wrists and ankles of the vampire, guaranteeing that it wouldn’t escape.The van pulled into the factory and out climbed a blonde headed man, dressed from head to toe in black, his face was beaming a wide smile at Alex.“You said forty minutes,” said Alex. She crossed her arms over her chest.“We had a slippery one,” he said.Alex rolled her eyes. “He wasn’t that slippery.”The groan from the vampire beside her brought a smirk to her lips.“James, what are we going to do with the other one?”The blonde-haired man, James, turned to look at the other man sitting in the front seat of the van.James said, “Keep it unconscious for now; Alex and I will see what we can get from its friend first.”“Will we?” asked Alex. Her head tilting slightly to look up at James.“You can have first shot?” he offered, closing the gap between them and cupping her face in his hands.Alex’s eyes seemed to glimmer with excitement. She nodded and pushed herself up on her toes to press a kiss to James’ lips. “Afterwards, you owe me dinner.”James nodded. He pressed another kiss to the corner of her mouth. “I thought pizza in bed would be best.”“If you two keep going, I’m going to bed sick.”The strained voice made Alex and James turn. The vampire was slouched in the chair, his head leaning back, his eyes half-open.Alex’s smile faded. “No one was talking to you.”The vampire rolled his eyes. “If you are going to kill me, do it before the lovey-dovey shit. Or let me go; I was in the middle of my dinner when you attacked me.”The chains around the vampire tightened, pulling a loud scream out of him.“Shut it,” said James. He dropped his hand.The vampire spat and hissed. “When I get out of here, I will eat you first, pretty boy and make the girly watch. Then I’ll enjoy taking my time with you.”Alex glared at the vampire.“My girls, your worst nightmare,” said James.The vampire laughed.“I don’t think he understands the situation he’s in,” said Alex.James sighed and walked around the vampire to stand behind the chair he was bound to. “I think he’d like a demonstration.”Alex’s glare lessened, the corner of her mouth twitched up slightly as she rolled her head to the side.The vampire kept his eyes locked on her, and after a moment, his body stiffened. His fingers gripped the arms of the chair, and his skin turned white as he clenched his eyes shut. He went ridged before his mouth fell open, and a crying scream came out of him.Another a few moments longer, Alex turned from the vampire, breaking the spell.The vampire gasped with relief and struggled against the binds. “I’m going to enjoy killing you.”“Enough, banter,” said James. He walked around the chair. “Where’s Klaus?”“Who?” the vampire asked, staring James down.Alex huffed.The vampire screamed in pain. “I don’t know the guy.”“Sure you do,” said James, a smirk gracing his lips. “Klaus Mikaelson. Original vampire.” He took a seat on a box and crossed his arms.“Never met him,” the vampire said through clenched teeth. He let out another scream of pain.“I can keep giving you aneurisms all night,” said Alex.The vampire hissed at her.“Let’s try again,” said James. “Location, now.”The vampire tugged at the chains. “Fuck you. Torture me; I’m not saying shit.”Alex turned away from the vampire and moved towards the van. She nodded to James’ man in the van. He climbed out and opened the back sliding door. Inside the van was another bound vampire, a red-headed female that was bound and unconscious. She was dragged from the van and placed onto another chair.The male vampire struggled. “Sammie!”The female stirred.Alex walked over to her and smacked her on the cheek. “Wakey, wakey.”The female blinked open her eyes and took a moment to take in her surroundings before she struggled.Alex moved to stand behind her; she placed her hands on either side of the female vampires head and said, “Klaus’ location?”The male vampire looked between the female and Alex.“Alright, then,” said Alex. Her fingers tensed against the vampires head.The female vampire’s body went rigid, and her eyes grew wide. A sob wracked out of her, and she gasped for breath.“Sammie!” the male screamed.“Tell us what we want to know, and Alex will stop. Your girlfriend won’t have to suffer anymore,” said James.The female let out another scream.“Alright,” the male vampire cried. “I don’t know his exact location, but I know what he’s after.”James rolled his eyes. “We know what he’s after. Everyone does. He wants to break the curse. He always has.”“I know where the moonstone is,” added the vampire.“Really?”Alex paused her torture. “If we had that, we could lure him to us.”James shrugged. “Maybe, but without a way to kill him, it won’t do us much good.”Alex asked, “The Council want to know where Klaus is; the best way to do that is to take the thing he needs the most.”“If we’re being technical, the thing he needs the most is the do—”“No,” Alex cut him off, “we are not getting her involved.”“Alex, she is already involved.”Alex frowned.James walked over to her and cupped her face, his thumbs stroking her cheeks. “We will keep her safe. I promise.”“Yes, I know that. But the best way to keep her safe is to keep her out of all this supernatural crap.” Alex grasped James’ wrists. “The moonstone will have to work; I’ll make it work.”James nodded. “Alright.” He released Alex. “You heard her,” he said, “where’s the moonstone?” He turned back to the male vampire.The male vampire was breathing heavily. “Let Sammie go first.”Alex shook her head. “Doesn’t work like that.”“It’s called negotiating,” he snapped.Alex laughed. “I don’t negotiate with vampires.” She grabbed the females head.The scream that came out was louder than any of the others; blood started to spill from the female’s ears and from her nose.“No, Sammie,” the male begged.She cried and screamed, her skin starting to turn grey.“Okay!” he yelled. “It’s in Mystic Falls!”“What?” Alex released the female vampire. Anger flared across her face, her hands clenching as she moved around the female towards the male.James stopped her by taking her arm. He asked, “How do you know that?”“Katherine Pierce, she was looking for it.” The vampire took a shaky breath.“Continue,” said James.“She was messing around with a wolf; apparently, his family had the stone, and she wanted him to get it.”Alex asked, “How do you know all this?”The vampire smirked. “Not all vampires and wolves hate one another; a few of us have learned to live without unnecessary brutality.”“Says the vampire who enjoys hunting humans,” mocked Alex.“You’re no better than me. You’re getting off on torturing us.”Alex scoffed. “You are vermin. An abomination of nature; you shouldn’t exist. I’m doing the world a service by getting rid of your kind.”The vampire hissed.“Johnny?” the soft mumble caught their attention.The male turned to the female; she seemed to be coming out of the pain induced fog.She looked up. “Johnny?”“I’m here, baby,” said the male.“It hurts,” she whimpered.“I can help with that,” said Alex.The male yanked at his binds. “Stay away from her.”Alex let out a heavy sigh and walked around the female vampire. Looking at the redhead made her sad. When she allowed herself to remember how vampires were once human, it caused a small ache to appear, but she knew that she was letting them rest by killing them. No longer would they be controlled by their unnatural thirst for blood.“Please,” the female whimpered.“It’s okay,” said Alex, her voice soft. “It will be over soon, and you will be at peace.”The female sobbed.“Sammie!” cried the male.Alex held out her hand, and James stepped towards her. He placed a carved wooden stake in her hand. She twisted it in her grip without looking away from the vampire. She gripped the handle, and with a swift strike, she drove the wooden point into the vampire’s heart.“SAMMIE!” The grief-ridden cry that came out of the male vampire was heart clenching.The female vampire gasped for breath as her skin turned grey, and she withered in her seat. Her dead body sagged against the chair.Alex pulled the stake out of her before handing it back to James, who took it and walked over to the male vampire. Alex turned to watch James plunge the dagger into the male vampire’s chest, killing him.With both vampires dead, Alex let out a huff. “Well, now that’s dealt with, you owe me pizza.”James smiled. “Clean up, report, then dinner.”Alex rolled her eyes. “Fine.” *** A hot shower had allowed Alex to feel relaxed. The grime of hunting vampires was gone, and she was dressed in one of James’s hooded jumpers with her damp hair tied back. A large pizza was sitting open on the foot of the bed, and Alex was finishing off her second glass of wine as James lay beside her.The hunt for Klaus had taken them down an unwanted path. The task given to both her and James a year prior had been full of dead ends and endless days watching and waiting. And now they had a lead, a good lead. But it was going to take them back to Mystic Falls, a place Alex thought she could avoid returning to.She hadn’t been back to her home town since her parents had died. Alex knew she had taken the cowards way out and had run, run away from the siblings that needed her, and decided that her time would be best spent hunting vampires. A part of her also said that she had done it to keep her family supernatural free, but that was only a very small part.“Renee wants to see me tomorrow,” said Alex.James nodded. “Not surprising.”“Whether or not if she lets me, I’m going to Mystic Falls,” said Alex.It was a place she hated, full of memories—good and bad—but not a place she had ever wanted to face again. But knowing that the moonstone was there and that Katherine was most likely there too meant she had to.When Alex had learned about the origins of vampires, she learned that her younger sister, Elena, was the Petrova doppelganger. An important ingredient in a curse that was placed on one of the eldest vampires in existence. Alex knew she needed to keep her sister safe and keep any and all supernatural beings away from her.“The Council have never stopped you from going back to see them,” said James.Alex sighed. She put the wine glass down on her bedside table and then laid down to snuggle against James’s bare chest. “I know. It somehow seemed easier to just stay away.”James pressed a kiss to her forehead. “When was the last time you spoke to them?”“The day of the funeral.”James ran his fingers along his back.“I left while everyone was at the wake. Jeremy caught me leaving; he begged me to stay.”That day haunted Alex, her younger brother’s cries, as he begged her not to leave him. She would never blame him if he hated her.“I think he would understand,” said James.Alex took a shaky breath, stopping the tears that wanted to form. “He probably doesn’t, but I don’t blame him. But this isn’t about me. If Katherine is in Mystic Falls, then they are all in danger.”James nodded. “We’ll keep them safe.”Alex pressed a firm kiss against James’s lips. She believed him because they both knew they would die trying.
  
    Chapter Text
    Alex’s favourite café in Chicago was a small corner shop that was cosy and warm. Large overstuffed chairs sat around the tables, and the walls were filled with books—all of which were provided for customers to read. Alex was enjoying her second latte of the morning as she flipped through a file labelled Katherine Pierce. Pages and pages detailed the life, death and life after death of the well-known vampire.The Council had been collecting information on Katherine for many years but never had they successfully caught the vampire bitch. There had been many attempts; Alex had first met the vampire with her sister’s face on accident when she had just started hunting vampires. It had been a shock to learn that her little sister, Elena, was a Petrova doppelganger. A supernatural occurrence. One of nature’s loopholes. The first time Katherine had startled Alex, she hesitated but quickly realised that Katherine was nothing like her sister. Still learning about her witchcraft and her own personal limits, Alex pushed too hard, too fast, and almost cost Jamie his life and killed herself in the process.Katherine had used Alex’s overconfidence against her and had almost drained Jamie. It had been the two other witches that had come with them but had split off from them, showing up that stopped her. Katherine had fled instead of finishing them off, and Alex had learnt a valuable lesson.The Council brought witches together to work together and rely on one another because witches were stronger collectively. Alex learnt the hard way that she couldn’t do everything herself.James was the first witch, or warlock—as he preferred—that had she bonded with. The Council had pared them together, and he taught everything she knew. Not only when it came to magic, but about trusting herself and her instincts. About killing vampires. He was also the first person that she had ever fallen in love with. James became her rock and her best friend. The thought that she could have lost him before she’d had him made her want to kill Katherine even more.Flicking to the newest updates on Katherine Pierce, it seemed that she had been reported in Virginia. Alex clicked her tongue in annoyance; there wasn’t much to go on. But Katherine had been running and hiding for five hundred years, so it never surprised Alex when the Council didn’t have much.The chair across from Alex shifted as an older woman with short red hair sat down. The woman smiled warmly and lifted a takeaway coffee to her lips.Alex snapped the file closed. “Renee.”“Alexandra, you and James did fantastic work last night.” She placed her coffee cup down. “The elders were pleased.”Renee was the first witch that Alex had ever met. Initially, Alex believed their meeting to be coincidental, but after learning that her first accidental spouts of magic would have alerted any powerful enough witch to her presence, she knew that Renee had come looking for her. Renee had been the one to help Alex understand that fires starting when she got mad or glass shattering when she got scared wasn’t just freaky circumstances, but her magic reacting to her emotions.Renee had offered Alex a chance to learn her craft and leave the miserable life she had in Mystic Falls behind. Without Renee, Alex wouldn’t know what type of life she would have or what kind of witch she would be.“I’m going to Mystic Falls,” said Alex, putting the file down.Renee nodded. “We expected nothing less.”“I need to keep my sister safe.”Renee nodded again. “The last thing the Council want is for Klaus to break his curse. You have the Council behind you in whatever you need. Find the moonstone, kill Katherine Pierce.”“James and I will head out tomorrow.” Alex smiled. She would enjoy killing Katherine.“No.”Alex frowned.“James has another job to do. You will be going alone.”“What happened to never work alone?” asked Alex. The Council never approved solo missions. Too many witches died that way.“It will be easier for you to blend back into Mystic Falls on your own. If you find yourself in need of assistance, let me know, I’ll send in some backup. But for now, you go alone.” Renee leant over and opened the bag that was sitting by her feet. She pulled out two files and then placed them on top of Katherine’s.“What are these?” asked Alex.“Detailed reports on all current supernatural beings in Mystic Falls,” explained Renee.“You told me there were no vampires or werewolves in Mystic Falls.” Alex glared at her mentor across the table.Renee shrugged. “The last you asked, there weren’t. Things have changed.” She stood, grabbing her coffee and her bag. “I’ll expect regular updates.”Alex bit down the words she wanted to throw at her mentor as she walked out of the coffee shop. Renee wasn’t exactly a person Alex would say she liked. Renee was her mentor, and Alex trusted her, but the woman cared for no one else’s emotions. She was goal-orientated, do whatever it took to get something done, regardless of collateral damage.Grabbing the top folder that Renee had dumped in front of her, Alex sighed. She was going to need another coffee.For thirty minutes, Alex read. In the months since their parents had died and Alex had said her final goodbyes to her siblings, Mystic Falls had become overrun with the supernatural. Damon and Stefan Salvatore, brothers, turned by Katherine in 1864, had returned, and trouble had come with them. Vicki Donovan, Elena’s ex-boyfriend’s little sister, had been turned and then killed. Caroline Forbes, Elena’s friend, had also been turned into a vampire. It also seemed from a few photos that Elena was involved with the Salvatore brothers, mainly Stefan.Alex turned one page and felt bile creep up her throat. It showed her little sister lip-locked with the undead Stefan Salvatore. The bile faded, and anger replaced it. It seemed Alex was going to have to save her sister from herself.Pulling out her phone, Alex called James.“How’d it go?” asked James.Alex sighed. “I’m going to Mystic Falls.”“What happened to we?” he asked.“Apparently, Renee has a job for you. They want me to go alone.”“If you need me, I’ll come with you.”Alex smiled at his words. “Thank you, but Renee did have a point. I will have an easier time fitting in; no one will suspect me as much if I’m alone.”James sighed. “Alright. But the moment you need me, I’m there.”“I love you,” said Alex.“I love you too.”Alex knew that go back to Mystic Falls was going to be difficult. The last time she had gone back was after she received a voicemail from Jenna. Elena was in the hospital, and their parents were dead. They had all drowned after their car had gone off Wickery Bridge. Alex hadn’t hesitated to rush back.She went straight to the hospital and found Elena lying in a bed, her eyes red and cheeks puffy. Neither of them had spoken when Elena had noticed her. Alex climbed onto the bed beside her, and they both cried.Alex stayed in town for four days. Once Elena was home, and their parents were in the ground, Alex knew she couldn’t stay. She left her siblings in the care of their aunt, knowing they would be better with Jenna than her. Alex was too young to guide her siblings.It wasn’t something she talked about, but Alex wondered if her siblings talked about her every day. She wanted to know if they wondered where she was and what she was doing. If they wanted her to come home, or if they hated her. Alex told herself that if they hated her, that would be okay; they were better off living a life without supernatural interference.Leaving the café, Alex found herself mentally preparing to go back to her old home. She would need to be careful about what she told her family. There would be no point hiding the truth; they needed to know that she was a witch and adopted. Elena needed the truth, as did Jeremy. They also deserved to know why she left them.
  
    Chapter Text
    Mystic Falls didn’t change. A town full of history obsessed fools that celebrated every small thing related to the town’s founding families. It was one of the many things that Alex had always hated about her home town and her family name. The Gilbert family was one of the founding families, which meant she got dragged to every event, kicking and screaming. The older she got, the more she calmed down, accepting the things she had to do. Sneaking off after a few minutes also seemed to work in her favour; her parents were too wrapped up in their friends to notice.Alex couldn’t stop the smile that graced her lips as she remembered leading Elena out of some stupid founders party to hang out down by the lake on the Lockwoods property; they shared a bottle of champagne and got very drunk. The punishment had been worth the crime in their eyes, and it hadn’t stopped a repeat performance.As Alex pulled up outside her family home, 2104 Maple Street, the bad memories came back full force. Alex could see Jeremy standing on the front porch crying as she drove away; she could hear her mother screaming at her to come back after they had argued about where she had been going; Alex remembered how her bed had caught fire after she had argued with her father. But she could also see herself sitting on the front porch swing with Elena, laughing and talking about boys. The family movies nights. Making dinner with her father. It all made Alex want to run away, but she couldn’t. Not anymore.There were no cars parked in the driveway when Alex parked her car. She had no idea who she would find inside; she hoped it would be Elena or Jeremy. There was no real plan about what would happen; she just hoped they didn’t kick her out because that would make things difficult.Alex paused at the front door. Walking in was probably too overconfident; she didn’t live in the house anymore. She settled for knocking and frowned when no one answered. Alex looked in the windows and realised that no one was home. The idea of waiting on the front porch was daunting, but the door was locked. Glancing around, Alex used her magic to flick the lock. The door swung open, and silence greeted her.The house hadn’t changed. The furniture was the same, the photos on the walls, shoes by the door, jackets on the hook. Alex walked slowly through the entrances toward the kitchen and paused when she noticed the family phone. Alex’s parents, Miranda and Grayson, stood with Alex, Elena and Jeremy. Alex had her arms around her siblings while their parents hugged them all from behind. The wide smiles were genuine, as had been the laughter that followed when Matt Donovan—Elena’s boyfriend at the time—had tripped over his own feet as he walked towards them. That day was probably the last happy day they had all had together.Alex found herself reaching up to touch the picture and tears welling in her eyes.The lock of the front door clicked and swung open.Alex turned and paused as four familiar faces walked inside.“Easy. Grab the door, Jer,” said Matt Donovan.He was holding Jenna’s arm over his shoulder, supporting her as he helped her through the door.Jenna sighed. “Hey, stop fussing. I’m fine.” She was holding the side of her stomach, wincing slightly.“The doctor said that you have to take it easy,” said Elena. She was carrying a few bags.Jeremy said, “Yeah, you don’t want to rip your stitches, haemorrhage and die, alright?”It was Jeremy who spotted Alex first. He froze and dropped the keys in his hand. The others paused and noticed his reaction.“Jeremy?” asked Elena.Jeremy’s eyes looked confused. As he stared at Alex, his mouth opened slightly before it closed.Elena’s eyes widened in shock. “Alex?”Alex wasn’t sure how to respond, so she said, “Hey.”“Hey? That’s all you have to say?” snapped Jeremy.Alex swallowed.The shock was gone, but Alex could see the overwhelming anger in his eyes.“Jeremy, don’t.” Elena reached out to him.“Don’t what, Elena? She abandoned us.” Jeremy glared at Elena before turning his look back to Alex.“You’re right,” said Alex, “I did. But it was for the best that I left.”“For the best?” Jeremy scoffed.“Jeremy, stop it,” said Jenna.Jeremy shook his head and moved towards the stairs. No-one stopped him as he stormed upstairs and slammed the door shut.Alex sighed. “I suppose I deserved that.”Elena nodded. “Yeah.”“Ahh.”Alex turned to Jenna, who was still being held by Matt, awkwardly. “Maybe you should lay down,” she said.Matt nodded and moved Jenna to lay down on the couch.“What happened?” asked Alex.Jenna sighed. “It’s embarrassing. I walked into a knife in the kitchen.” She laughed at herself. “Who does that?”Alex noticed the guilt flash over Elena’s face.“It was a freak accident,” said Elena, “it happens.”Moving to stand across from Jenna, Alex couldn’t help but think that wasn’t the whole story. She knew that Elena was involved with vampires, but Jenna might have had no idea. If something else had happened that led to Jenna getting hurt, a vampire could have compelled her to forget.“I think I should leave you all to talk,” said Matt. He stood from the couch.Elena smiled at him awkwardly. “Thanks, Matt.”Alex didn’t expect a warm welcome; the idea that Jeremy and Elena were going to run and hug her was a stupid fantasy. She had left them when they needed her most; of course, they were pissed.“Why are you here?” asked Elena. She sat beside Jenna, a mix of emotions on her face.Alex swallowed and cleared her throat. “I came back to help.”Elena frowned.“With what exactly?” asked Jenna.“There is a lot to tell you, and some of it is confusing. Some of it you might not believe, but it is all completely true.”“You’d be surprised what I’d believe,” said Elena.“I guess I should start at the beginning.”“That’s normally best.”“Before the car accident, I discovered that I was adopted.”Elena’s eyes didn’t widen in surprise like Alex expected. Instead, she wasn’t phased.“You don’t look surprised.”“I found a little while ago that I was adopted; Jenna told me the truth about my birth and also admitted the truth about yours,” said Elena.“It made no sense to keep it from them once they learned about Elena,” said Jenna.“Alright, well, my birth family are a little different from your typical family.” Alex seemed to struggle to find the right words. And she was; she wasn’t sure how to accidentally tell Jenna about witches, vampires and werewolves without making it seem intentional.Elena’s face cracked in a smile.“What’s funny?” Alex asked.Elena said, “My birth mother, Isobel, was my current history teachers wife.”Isobel Flemming, Alex had learnt about her not long after learning the truth about Elena. As a vampire, the woman was exactly like Katherine, and Alex had hoped Elena would never have to meet her.“Wow,” said Alex. “The chances of that.”Elena pursed her lips and raised her eyebrows.“Mine’s a little different to that.”“How so?” asked Jenna.Alex decided to just chuck it out and see what would happen. “I’m a witch,” she said.Elena’s eyes bulged.Jenna laughed. “Very funny.”Alex sighed, “I’m not joking.” She held up her hand and focused on a book sitting on the shelf across the room. After a moment, it flew off the shelf and into Alex’s hand.Jenna’s laugh dissipated, and her face was very similar to Elena’s.“The whole reason I left was that I couldn’t control my magic. I set my bed on fire more than once. I accidentally kept blowing up light bulbs, and I hurt mum,” Alex explained.Elena’s body sagged into the couch.“Holy shit,” exclaimed Jenna.“I can control it now; my emotions are the mess they were as a teenager.” Alex ran her hands over the book and then held it up. The book floated across the room and back into its place on the shelf.“That is insane!” Jenna gasped as she shifted, her hand clasping her side. “Shit, that hurts.”Elena watched Jenna carefully. “Did you want some tea?” she asked.Jenna smiled. “That would be great.”Elena looked at Alex. “I’ll make some for all of us.”Alex nodded.Elena walked over to the kitchen as Jeremy walked back downstairs. He glared at Alex from across the room but didn’t say anything to her, but he turned and whispered something to Elena.Alex left them be and moved towards Jenna. “I can help you with that if you’d like.”Jenna frowned. “How?”“I can speed up your healing process,” said Alex.Jenna seemed to consider her words before nodding. “Sure, why not. Anything to stop this pain.”Alex sat on the edge of the coffee table and placed her hand carefully against Jenna’s stomach. She closed her eyes and felt her power stirring. A small moan from Jenna and Alex felt her power run over Jenna’s stab wound.“Wow,” said Jenna, “that is amazing.”Alex sat back and removed her hand.Sitting up, Jenna pulled up her shirt to see that her wound was already looking better. “Thank you,” she said.The banging of a door startled them both, but it seemed that Jeremy had stormed out again. Elena was standing in the kitchen, holding her head in her hands.“It’s my fault; I’m sorry,” said Alex.Elena shook her head. “It’s not you.”Alex didn’t believe that for a second.Once Elena made tea, Alex explained everything else. She kept as close to the truth as possible. Not long after her accidents with magic, Renee showed up and helped her. Alex chose to join Renee’s cover and learn how to be a witch. It was safer for her to leave than stay with her family. Alex thought it would be best, for the moment, to avoid any and all mention of how she mainly hunted down vampires.It was almost dinner time when Alex was satisfied she’d covered everything, and Elena looked more understanding than before. Jenna was mostly asleep on the couch, and Alex found herself upstairs with Elena in her bedroom. They hadn’t wanted to disturb Jenna as they continued.Elena sat on the end of her bed as Alex stood by her dresser.“Why did you just tell us?” asked Elena.Alex sighed. “At the time, I was terrified. I was a freak. I had no idea what to think about myself, let alone what you all would think and say.”“You’re my sister, Alex. I love you no matter what.”Alex didn’t realise how much relief she would feel to hear Elena say such a thing. There had been the expectation that her family would reject her and that if there was ever a possibility of fixing what had been broken, that it would be incredibly small. But that didn’t seem to be the case. Elena seemed to be understanding.Alex walked over and sat beside her on the bed. “So, I’ve told you all about me. What has been happening here?”Elena smile was only half-hearted. Alex could tell that she wasn’t sure what to tell her. The hope that Elena would just tell her everything was probably false, but Alex hoped that since Elena knew she was a witch, she wouldn’t be too shy with the details.“I have a boyfriend,” said Elena, “his name’s Stefan.”Alex forced a wide smile across her face. She wanted to sneer and gag at the mention of the vampire, but she couldn’t let her disgust show. Not yet.“Is that so?” Alex asked.“Yeah, and he’s amazing. I’m in love with him.”Elena wasn’t compelled; she had genuine feelings for Stefan. The look on her sisters face told Alex that it was true love. It made Alex pause and wonder what would her sister do if Alex did kill Stefan.“Love is an amazing thing,” said Alex, “I’m glad you’ve found it.”“There’s something you should know, though,” said Elena.Alex could feel it; Elena was going to tell her.“Stefan, he’s a—”Elena’s phone rang, interrupting them.She sighed. “Sorry, just a sec.”The call went for no more than a few seconds before Elena was apologising and leaving. Alex had tried to find out where she was going, but all she said was friend drama. Elena was out the door, leaving Alex alone in a house full of haunting memories and a sleeping Aunt.There was so much to do and so little time; Alex was in Mystic Falls to find the moonstone, she couldn’t allow herself to get too caught up in her family drama. But Alex also knew she couldn’t ignore it.
  
    Chapter Text
    Sleep hadn’t come easy for Alex.The last time she had been in her childhood room was the day of the funeral. She’d pack up her bag and left. Jenna had insisted that she stay; her room hadn’t really changed all that much. All of what she had left behind was still there, and the room had been cleaned; there wasn’t a spec of dust in sight.It didn’t help that Elena hadn’t come home that night. Alex assumed that her friend drama had kept her out, and when Jenna didn’t show any concern, Alex decided to let it be. She heard Jeremy come home; he exchanged a few words with Jenna before going up to his room, passing Alex as he did but ignoring her like she didn’t even exist. It hurt for Jeremy to act in such a way, but she understood why.When Alex decided that sleep would elude her, she climbed out of bed and took a seat on the chair in the corner of her room. It had once been the place she had sat and read or sketched in her notepad. Alex pulled a blanket over her legs and pulled out her phone.“Mystic Falls driven you crazy yet?” asked James as he answered.Alex smiled. “Not yet.”“How are you?” he asked.Alex sighed and sunk lower in the chair. “I’m okay. Things went better than expected.”“Did you tell them?”“That I’m a witch, yes—well, I told Elena and Jenna. Jeremy didn’t stick around to listen.”“How did Elena take the news she was going to need a new boyfriend?”“I thought it would be wise to leave that part out.”“Probably wise.”“What assignment has Renee got you on?”“Hunting down a nest. Four of them; got three of already, there’s just one that slipped through the cracks.”“That seems to happen to you a lot.”“Only because you’re not here.”“I wish you were with me.”“I do too.”There was a quiet moment between them. Both just wishing they could side by side.James broke it and said, “On a positive note, being here did give me some time to do some research for you. I don’t know if it was in the files that Renee gave you, but back in 1864, a group of vampires were rounded up and locked in a church that the founders burnt to the ground.”“Yeah, I read that,” said Alex.The files that Renee had provided were detailed about every supernatural that had ever been to Mystic Falls.“Did it also say that those vampires were freed a few weeks ago?” asked James.Alex sat up. “No, it didn’t.”“All of those vampires are dead now, but a big empty tomb like that would be a great place to hide a moonstone.”Alex smiled. It would be a very good hiding place. But it also seemed too easy, and if the Salvatore’s knew about the moonstone, would they put it in such a place.“I may need to check it out,” said Alex.“I’ll keep digging if you like, see what else I can learn.”“That would be great. Anything would be helpful at the moment.”They changed the subject after that, leaving business be and talking about anything but what was looming. James caught Alex up on what James’ little sister Sarah had managed to do within twenty-four hours; the girl, while Alex adored her, had a habit of getting into trouble. James blamed it on teenage rebellion.When sleep did finally come in was in the chair. Alex fell asleep curled up in the chair and woke up to Jeremy calling out Elena’s name. Her neck and back ached as she moved, but she stood up from the chair and dropped the blanket on the end of the bed. In the hallway, Jeremy had opened Elena’s room and was frowning at Elena’s empty bed. The look on his face made Alex believe that he had expected her to come home, but she hadn’t.“Good morning,” said Alex.Jeremy turned, his clear displeasure at seeing her still etched on his face as he turned back towards his room.Alex sighed. “You can be pissed at me all you want, but ignoring me is going to get real old real fast.”Jeremy scoffed. “You’ll just take off again, so why bother even trying. Just leave us again. We don’t need you.”The stab of his words hurt, but Alex kept her face firm. “I did what I thought was right for all of us.”Jeremy shook his head and went to walk into his room.Alex decided he needed to listen, and he wasn’t going to keep walking away from her. With intention, every single bedroom door slammed shut.Jeremy jumped, his eyes widening before he turned to look at Alex. “Did you just…”Alex nodded. “I did. If you had given me a chance yesterday, I would have explained it all to you like I did to Elena and Jenna.”He grasped the ends of his hair and tugged. “How are you a witch?”Alex sighed. “I was adopted, like Elena.”Jeremy nodded slowly. “Of course you were.”“I left because I couldn’t control myself,” explained Alex. “I was setting fires, exploding light bulbs. I even hurt Mum.”Jeremy swallowed, his eyes turning sad.“I was terrified that I was going to hurt you or Elena, so I left to keep you safe.” Alex pushed away from her door and crossed the landing to stand in front of Jeremy. She reached out and took his hands in hers. Alex was grateful he didn’t pull away. “It hurt every day that I couldn’t be with you two, but you and Elena are the most important people in my life, and I would rather you hate me than lose you.”Tears welled in Jeremy’s eyes.“I get it; I do.” Alex reached up and caught the tear that fell down his cheek. “And you can hate me all you want, but I love you, Jer.”The hug that Jeremy engulfed Alex in was surprising. She hadn’t expected him to squeeze her against him and start to sob into his shoulder. Alex wrapped her arms around her little brother; he really wasn’t that little anymore, he towered over her, and his weight was heavy against her. But she let Jeremy press his face into her shoulder and cry.Once the tears subsided and the siblings stepped back, Jeremy offered Alex a smile before leaving. He was off to school. It took Alex a moment to collect herself before getting ready. A hot shower helped her feel a little more human and ready to face the messed up town around her. It also let her work out her plan for the day.Downstairs in the kitchen, Alex found Jenna. She was looking brighter, and the pain from her injury was almost gone.“Good morning,” said Jenna.Alex smiled. “Morning. Feel better?”Jenna nodded. “Loads. I don’t feel like I accidentally stabbed myself.” She laughed. “You and Jeremy had a little heart to heart.”Alex nodded. “We did, and I think it’s a start.”“I’m glad. They have both missed you.”“I’ve missed them too.”Alex took over making breakfast, as she could actually cook, and the two chatted for a short while. They discussed the mundane things, and Alex was glad to hear that Jeremy was doing well in school.Once they finished and cleaned up, Alex used the excuse of needing to reimmerse herself in the town to leave. She grabbed her bag and headed out towards the ruins of the old church. The file that Renee had given her, told her the exact location of the ruins, and Alex remembered getting drunk once or twice near it.Alex didn’t expect to find much in the tomb below the ruins, but there was no harm in looking. She parked her car off the road before hiking it the rest of the way. It wasn’t too far from the main road, and the recent footsteps along the ground meant that someone had been there recently.Looking around, Alex felt that familiar itch under her skin. A vampire was nearby, and her magic was alerting her.Unlike other witches that required physical contact to tell them if a vampire was a vampire, or a werewolf was a wolf, or even if a witch was a witch, Alex could feel it in the air. An electric static along her skin told her everything she needed; it was like a sixth scent. Each supernatural felt different, and the buzz along her arms told her it was definitely a vampire.The ruins of the old church look well travelled. Drag marks, footprints and the buzz of magic. There was strong magic vibrating from beneath the ground. Alex followed her senses and made her way down the cleared stairs towards a stone door.Pulling out her phone, Alex dialled James.“Hey, what’s going on?” he asked.“You said that the tomb spell was broken,” said Alex.“It was,” said James, “all of the vampires were freed. They all got wiped out by the human council there.”“Well, someone put it back up.”“Really?” he asked, the surprise evident in his voice.“Yeah. It’s strong but new. Whoever did this is still learning.”“Why would they have put up a boundary spell?” asked James.“To keep others out,” said Alex.Looking at the door, she raised her hand.“Or maybe to keep someone in.”Alex clenched her hand, and the door shifted before falling forwards, crashing onto the ground.“Alex, what just happened?” asked James.As the dust settled, Alex almost laughed. Standing across the threshold of the doorway was a familiar face.Alex smirked, “Well, hello, Katherine.”
  
    Chapter Text
    “I know you,” said Katherine, her head turning to one side.Alex scoffed. “Unfortunately, you do.”“Katherine’s in the tomb?” asked James.Alex kept her eyes on the vampire before clearing her throat. “Yeah,” she said, “I’ll call you back.” Alex disconnected the call and put her phone back into her pocket. “I’ll admit,” she said to Katherine, “I didn’t expect to find you in here.”Katherine’s jaw clenched, and she leant against the wall, her hand pressing up against the invisible barrier. “I put my trust in the wrong person.”Alex laughed. “Trust, or did your fear tactics turn against you?”The flash in Katherine’s eyes just made Alex laugh even more.“Did that pretty blonde boy survive?” asked Katherine. Her face twisting into a sickening sadistic smirk.Alex’s laughter died. “He’s perfectly fine.”She sighed. “Shame, I was hoping he’d die in your arms.”“If you want to kill a witch, you should just do it. Don’t let them bleed out.”Katherine nodded. “Next time.”“There won’t be a next time.”“Is that so?”“You know, I didn’t think you’d be so easy to track down. It’s rather disappointing that I found you all locked up.”“Why did you come here if you weren’t looking for me?”“I was looking for the moonstone; figured a big empty tomb would be a great hiding spot.”Katherine bent down and picked up a white rock. She wiggled it at Alex. “Let me go, and it’s all yours.”Alex laughed.She focused on Katherine and enjoyed the look as agonising pain broke out across her face. Katherine dropped the moonstone and stumbled backwards. Breaking her torture on Katherine, she called the moonstone towards it. It shot into her hand, and Katherine lay on the ground panting.“Now, what are you going to offer me?” Alex asked. More to mock the vampire than anything else.“Why would you want the moonstone?” asked Katherine.“To keep Elena safe.”“Why would you care about the doppelganger?”“She’s my little sister.”The surprise on Katherine’s face was enough to bring Alex more laughter. This vampire who was supposedly cruel, terrifying and selfish was getting more and more pathetic.“I am going to keep the moonstone from Klaus and find a way to kill him once and for all. Then Elena can live her life without ever having to be sacrificed on an altar.”Katherine shook her head. “He will kill you and everyone you and Elena love if you try and stop him.”Alex took a step towards Katherine, standing toe against the barrier. “The difference between you and I, Katherine, is that I’m not afraid to die. I’m not a coward.”Katherine raced at the barrier by merely slammed against it.Shaking her head, Alex stepped back. “I think we wasted enough time. Goodbye, Katherine.”Alex opened her bag and pulled out her water bottle. She unscrewed the cap before throwing water towards Katherine; it splashed on her legs and dress.“No,” yelled Katherine.“Incendia.”The water burst into flames.“AHH!” she screamed. Katherine desperately tried to smother the flames on her skin; she screamed and pleaded, her voice cracking as she did. “Please!”“I told you there wasn’t going to be a next time.”“I know how to kill Klaus!”Alex paused and then killed the flames.Katherine let out a gasp of relief and sobbed.“Is that so?” asked Alex.Katherine nodded.“So?”Katherine smirked. “I don’t think so, you let me out of here, and I’ll tell you.”Alex clenched her jaw. “Why would I do a thing like that?”“Because I know how your coven works. Those elders will want the information I have more.” She laughed and pushed herself to sit up. “Go on, call them. Ask your bosses what they want more.”Alex wanted to just end it. She could find her own way to kill Klaus. The Council never needed to know that Katherine had any idea about how to kill an Original. If they let her go, there was no telling how many more innocent people would die because of her. It would be better for everyone if Katherine was dead.The ringing of her phone made Alex turn away from the slowly healing vampire. She pulled it out to see Jeremy’s name on her phone. She ignored the call and went to put it away when it rang again. Alex wanted to ignore him, but clearly, he wasn’t going to leave her alone.Climbing up the stairs and walking back into the open air, she answered, “Hey, I’m in the middle of—”“Elena’s been kidnapped.”“What?”“I don’t know what she’s told you, but you’re a witch, which means you know about vampires. Well, one has taken her.”“How do you know that?”“Last night, she told me she was heading straight home after the Lockwood’s party. I thought that she just went back to Stefan’s instead, but he hasn’t seen her. And her car is still parked in the Lockwood’s driveway.”Alex clenched her jaw. Katherine was locked in the tomb, Elena was missing. It seemed that when Elena had left the night before, Alex had missed out on something big.“Where are you?” asked Alex.“I’m at Stefan’s house. I came here with Bonnie so that she could try and track Elena.”“Bonnie? As in Bonnie Bennett?”“Yeah. She’s a witch like you.”Alex had read about the Bennett witches; they were always getting dragged into vampire business. It seemed that Bonnie was following the same path, but she had to be new at it. It made more sense how Katherine had been trapped back in the tomb; Bonnie would have had to be the witch that sealed her back in.“I’ll meet you there,” said Alex.“There is probably something that you should know before you get here,” said Jeremy.“What?”“Stefan and his brother, Damon. They’re vampires.”Alex wasn’t sure how she should have reacted. The plan had been to try and stay calm when Elena told her, to hide her disgust. Instead of reacting, unsure of how her little brother felt about them, she simply said, “Okay, I’ll be there soon.”She glanced back down at the hole that led down to Katherine. She would need to come back to deal with the bitch later. Once she had found Elena and spoken to Renee. As much as she wanted to rid the world of Katherine, she needed to talk to Renee about what she had said first. *** The Salvatore boarding house was a nice home. As Alex pulled outside, her skin was burning. Vampires and a witch. Her stomach was twisted as she felt them around her. It was unnerving that she would have to go into their home and play friendly, pretend that she didn’t want to kill them all. The most important thing was Elena, and if that meant working with vampires to save her, then so be it.Getting out of her car, Alex simply walked into the house.“Jeremy?” she called out.“In here!” he called.She walked down the hall and found her way blocked by a dark-haired vampire. If it wasn’t for the nausea coiling in her stomach, she might have found him handsome.“Who the hell are you?” he snapped.Alex sneered. “Get out of my way.”“You’re in my house, you little—”“Damon!” The other vampire appeared, Stefan. “She can help us.”“Who the fuck is she?” Damon yelled.“My sister,” said Jeremy.I stepped around Damon and walked over to Jeremy. Beside him, kneeling next to a coffee table, was Bonnie Bennett. The young girl before Alex wasn’t the Bonnie that she remembered, and the magic that sparkled around her showed the power she held, but it was also clear how new Bonnie was at it.Alex knelt down opposite her. “Any luck?”Bonnie’s eyes snapped open. The concern and pain in her eyes worried Alex. “Nothing, it won’t work.”Alex offered her a warm smile.There were blood drops on the map spread out across the table, and Jeremy held a towel to his hand.“Let me help,” Alex said and held out her hands.Bonnie took them. “Jeremy said you’re a witch too.”Alex nodded. “I am, but we can talk about that later. For now, concentrate.”Bonnie nodded.Together they chanted, “Phasmatos tribum, nas ex veas, sequitas sanguinem.”The blood on the map formed together and sliding across the paper before stopping. Bonnie opened her eyes and smiled.“Wow,” she said.Alex returned the smile. “She’s there.”“Can you narrow it down,” sneered Damon.Alex glared at him. “We aren’t a bloody GPS.”“We can map it,” said Jeremy, “aerial view will show us what’s around there, help us narrow down the area.”Stefan stepped up and clapped Jeremy on the shoulder. “Perfect. Call me with whatever you find.”Jeremy frowned. “No, no. I’m coming with you.”“No,” said Alex. “You are staying here.”“Alex—”“No, Jeremy. You stay with Bonnie, go back home just in case. I’ll go with Stefan.”“Like hell,” snapped Damon.Alex turned and twisted her wrist. She threw Damon across the room into a bookshelf. “Are you going to stop me?” she asked.Damon groaned and pushed himself up and charged.Alex was a little surprised when Stefan stepped in the way. He caught Damon by his shoulders and shoved him back. “She is Elena’s sister, Damon. Kill another one of her siblings, and she really will never talk to you again.”“Did you just say another one?” asked Alex.Stefan frowned and cleared his throat. Clearly uncomfortable with the subject he just brought up. He said, “We can discuss that later. For now, we need to save Elena.”“Right,” said Alex, glaring at Damon. “Let’s go.” *** It certainly wasn’t how Alex had expected the day to go. She had guessed that she would have checked out the tomb, found nothing, and spent the rest of the day trying to learn something. Alex had hoped to spend some time with Elena and Jeremy, maybe understand more about what was happening in the town of Mystic Falls. She was also curious about finding out what the Founder’s Council were up to.Alex hadn’t known about the council before she left; it was Renee who had explained it to her. All of the Founding Families learnt about vampires back in 1864; to learn that it was Katherine who had been the cause of it all wouldn’t surprise Alex now, but back then, it had been shocking to learn how little she knew about Mystic Falls.But riding in the back seat of Damon Salvatore’s car, a vampire that she was planning on killing—eventually—and also apparently responsible for Jeremy’s death. Stefan had briefly mentioned that Jeremy owned a family ring that kept him safe from supernatural deaths, but it still boiled her blood to hear that Damon had harmed him.Stefan Salvatore was the biggest surprise. Alex had watched vampires protect other vampires; they bonded in their shared hunger for blood. But Stefan was purely focused on Elena. Alex had sat and listened as the brother’s argued over how to save Elena. They had no information about who had taken her or why. Damon seemed convinced that it was an enemy from Katherine’s past who had kidnapped the wrong doppelganger.To Alex, it all seemed too coincidental. Katherine showed up looking for the moonstone. Now Elena had been kidnapped. Alex was worried that the news was out and that there was another human doppelganger. If that knowledge got back to Klaus, then time would be limited, and Alex would need to find a way to kill Klaus for good.Alex sighed and leant back against the seat. “How much further?” she asked.“About eight miles,” said Damon. “What the hell is that?”Alex glanced to see Stefan holding a bottle with liquid in it.“I don’t know,” said Stefan, “it’s a vervain bomb or a grenade launcher or something like that.”“Weird.”“Where did you get all that stuff?” asked Alex.“Alaric,” said Stefan. “He’s a vampire hunter.”“But he’s friends with you?” she asked.Stefan turned. “Sort of. It’s complicated.”Alex scoffed.Everything seemed complicated.Alex was relieved when Damon finally pulled the car over. They climbed out, and Alex felt the tingle along her skin. “Vampires,” she said.Damon sneered. “Yeah, we are right here.”She ignored him. “Three of them. That way.” She walked ahead of them towards the tree.“Hey, hold up,” called Damon. “We need a plan.”“The plan is to save Elena,” said Stefan.“Exactly,” adds Alex.“We don’t even know who they are.” Damon follows after them.Alex stopped to glare at him. “Either way, they’re dead.”“If we go in that house, we may not come back out,” said Damon.Stefan sighed and threw up his hands. “Alright then, I won’t come out.”“So noble, Stefan,” mocked Damon.Stefan walked towards Damon and looked him straight in the eye. He said, “I can’t think of a better reason to die, but if you want to stay here, I’ll totally understand.”Alex took a moment to realise what Stefan was saying. His words, his attitude. He was willing to die to save Elena. It was more than just keeping a source of blood alive; Stefan really cared about keeping her safe. Alex hadn’t seen them together, but the look in Stefan’s eyes was the same look that Elena had. Elena hadn’t been able to stop smiling when she talked about Stefan; she was completely in love with him. Alex believed that Stefan had manipulated her sister, convinced her that his affections were real. But watching Stefan march towards the house, she had the same determination when she wanted to save James from Katherine. Stefan loved Elena; there was no denying that.The closer to the house they became, the more Alex realised that the vampires inside were older. They were all in the same area, but she had no idea where Elena was. Stefan and Damon made their way in, being careful to not make a noise. Alex headed towards the front door, she wasn’t worried about facing off against vampires, but it would be the first time she’d done it on her own in a very long time.The sound of glass smashing told Alex that Stefan and Damon were inside. She waited and heard footsteps, then a raised voice.“Rose,” snapped a male voice.“I don’t know who it is,” replied a female.Alex waited and then heard the male again.“Excuse me. To whom it may concern, you’re making a great mistake if you think that you can beat me. You can’t. Do you hear that?”Alex hears wood cracking.“I repeat,” he continued, “you can’t beat me. So I want the girl…I’m going to count to three, or heads will roll. Do we understand each other?”Alex stepped closer to the door and then paused when she heard Elena.“I’ll come with you, just please don’t hurt my friends. They just wanted to help me out,” she said.“What game are you playing,” snapped the male.Alex took that as her queue to enter. She threw open the doors, making them slam against the wall. Before her stood Elena with a male vampire, a face she had seen before but only in photographs.Elijah Mikealson, one of the original vampires.“Who are you?” he asked.Alex smirked. “Her big sister—ventus!”Elijah flew backwards and hit the wall behind him. Elena gasped in shock and rushed down the stairs towards her. Elijah quickly righted himself before moving towards them. Damon rushed from the side, spearing him towards a door that they tumbled through.Elena reached Alex, and Alex quickly grasped her hand. “Are you okay?” she asked.Elena nodded. “I think so.”“Why are you covered in blood?” asked Alex, taking in her blood-soaked shirt.“I’ll explain later.”Damon came flying through the door.Elijah walked back into the entrance hall. “I’m am leaving with Elena, whether you like it or not.”“I think not,” said Alex.Stefan appeared, stake in hand. He charged Elijah but was thrown to the side. Damon reappeared with a broken hanger and ran at Elijah.Elijah caught the wooden spear and smirked, “I’m not some mear vampire; you can’t win.”Damon groaned against Elijah’s strength; he was trying to push the wood into Elijah’s chest. Stefan appeared beside him, both of them pushing, but Elijah didn’t budge.Alex lifted her hand and said, “Want to bet.”Elijah locked eyes with her; uncertainty flashed across his determined face before he was thrown backwards. Damon used the moment to slam the wood into Elijah’s heart. Elijah let out a painful groan as his skin turned grey, and he slumped forward.Stefan turned around and moved towards Elena, “Are you okay?” he asked.Elena nodded and rushed towards him, throwing her arms around him. “I think so.”Alex glanced between them and Elijah, whose body was impaled against the wall. She knew he wasn’t dead; that was the thing about Original vampires; you couldn’t just kill them like any other vampire.“We need to go,” said Alex.Elena pulled back from Stefan. “You came with them,” she said.Alex offered her a smile. “You’re my sister; of course I came.”“But you had no idea what you were walking into.”Alex reached for Elena. “We need to talk about everything.”Elena nodded. “Yeah, probably a good idea.”“But not here.” She took Elena’s hand and pulled her towards the door. “Let’s get you home.”
  
    Chapter Text
    It seemed that the Salvatore’s living room was the place to meet. And it wasn’t just the two vampires, Alex and Elena. Jeremy, Bonnie, Alaric and Caroline, had all shown up as well. Elena was sitting on one of the couches, her hands clenched in her lap. Stefan was sitting beside her, his hand running along her back soothingly. Alaric and Damon seemed intent on drowning a whole bottle of scotch before midday. The whole thing was rather uncomfortable in Alex’s eyes, but they all needed to talk.“So these vampires,” started Caroline, “wanted to turn you over to this Klaus person?”Elena nodded. “Apparently. Rose said that as the Petrova doppelganger, I am to be sacrificed to break the sun and the moon curse.”Alex wanted to laugh. The sun and the moon curse was the biggest piece of bullshit that Klaus and his family had spread across the world. He had vampires and werewolves alike, all believing such bullshit.“Something amusing, sister witch?” asked Damon. His eyes were locked on Alex as he took a sip of his drink.Alex hadn’t realised her internal laughter had become reflected on her face. She knew that she could brush it off, say that she was in denial about the whole thing. But lying about the Originals wasn’t going to keep Elena safe.“Alex?” asked Elena. She looked at her older sister, concerned.Alex sighed, letting her arms drop to her sides. “The sun and the moon curse isn’t real.”The seven identical looks of confusion that locked onto her was funny.Alex pushed her hair out of her eyes and explained, “It is a story made up by Klaus.”“Why would he make up a curse?” asked Bonnie.“The curse is real,” continued Alex, “it’s just not a curse on vampires and werewolves. It’s a curse on Klaus. Placed by a witch over a thousand years ago.”“What’s the curse?” asked Stefan.“Now that is a very complicated story,” said Alex, “but simply put, he isn’t just an original vampire. He’s part werewolf too.”“He’s both? Is that even possible?” asked Elena.Damon scoffed. “No. You can be either a werewolf or a vampire. There’s no both.”“Your naivety shows how little you really know, Damon,” snipped Alex.“If the curse doesn’t let vampires walk in the sun or werewolves turn whenever they want, why would Klaus make up a story like that?” asked Caroline.“To break the curse, you need to collect the ingredients that bound it together. And after a thousand years, things can get lost, stolen. The easiest way to find everything one needs to break a curse is to have everyone looking for it,” said Alex.“This sounds like bullshit to me,” grumbled Damon.“You can call it whatever you want. But Klaus hasn’t even lifted a finger, and everything he needs to break the curse is here in Mystic Falls. Vampire, Werewolf, Witch, Doppelganger and the moonstone,” Alex crossed her arms over her chest.Damon walked around the couch to stand directly in front of Alex. He squinted his eyes at her. “How do you know about the moonstone?”Alex noted that she probably shouldn’t have blurted out that she knew that the moonstone was in Mystic Falls. They had no idea that she knew about Katherine or that Katherine was in the tomb, supposedly with the moonstone.“It would surprise you how much I know,” said Alex.Damon scoffed. “Alright, enough. Elena, I don’t care if you think this witch is your sister; I don’t trust her.”“I don’t really care if you trust me; I’m not here for you.”“But you’re not here for Elena, though, are you?”“Damon!” snapped Stefan.“If you really cared,” continued Damon, “where have you been for the past year? She’s never mentioned you. Not once. And now suddenly, you’re back in town just when a supposedly big bad vampire wants to kill her. You haven’t shared the whole story.”Alex sneered at him. “I don’t have to tell you anything.”“But you should tell me.”Alex looked away from Damon to Elena, who had stood from the couch, arms wrapped around herself.Elena said, “There are things we both need to talk about.”Alex nodded. “That we do.” *** It was difficult to decide how much to explain. Alex knew that telling Elena everything would most likely lead to further distance between them. Elena seemed to be all about giving vampires the benefit of the doubt. Stefan was the man she loved; Caroline, her best friend who had been forcefully turned, was still incredibly important to her; even Damon, the one who deserved to die the most, seemed to have wormed his way in. Alex knew that if she told Elena that they were all on her kill list, she could lose her forever.The Salvatore house had cleared out to give them both privacy. Alex followed Elena upstairs to Stefan’s bedroom. Jeremy had been determined to stay, needing to be included, but for now, it was best he wasn’t dragged into even more mess.Elena took a seat on the edge of Stefan’s bed and clasped her hands together. “Who goes first?” she asked.Alex sighed and opened her bag. She pulled out a bunch of bound sage and held it up.“What’s that for?” asked Elena.Alex smiled. “Privacy—Incendia.”The end of the sage caught fire, small puffs of smoke blew out into the air. Alex placed the sage into an empty dish that was sitting on Stefan’s desk.She said, “No one, not even vampires, will be able to hear what we say.”“Worried about what Damon might do?” Elena asked.Alex smirked. “No. Damon, I can handle. But I want you to know that everything I am about to tell you is completely true. With no possibility of being overheard, I have nothing to hide.”“I want to trust you, Alex. But you’ve been gone for so long.”“I know. And I don’t blame you.”Elena asked, “Was Damon right? About you not coming back here for us?”“Partially.”The flash of hurt in Elena’s eyes was painful, but Alex was going to explain what she could without telling her too much.Alex sighed and walked over to sit beside her on Stefan’s bed. She said, “I told you that I joined a coven of witches; they have taught me everything I know. Including about the Originals, about the witch that turned them all into vampires, and the curse. Over the past thousand years, so much has happened because of Klaus and his obsession with breaking the curse that he has left a trail of destruction in his wake. Including Katherine Pierce.”“You know about Katherine?”Alex nodded. “I do. I’ve had my own run-ins with her before you even knew she existed. I was also extremely surprised to find her stuck in the tomb beneath the old church.”“So you came to Mystic Falls to find Katherine?”“Yes, and no. I came to Mystic Falls to find the moonstone, so I could protect you. And if I got to kill Katherine in the process, that was just a bonus.”“Does that mean that she’s dead?”“No, unfortunately.” Alex had to stop the pout that wanted to come out. However, it did remind her that she still needed to call Renee. “Jeremy interrupted that process when he called me about your kidnapping.”“Right, that.”“Speaking of, how did you all get Katherine in that tomb?”Elena sighed heavily and pushed her hair back. “It wasn’t the original plan. Not from what I’ve been told. Damon and Stefan were trying to kill Katherine. I found out when we were talking and knew that I had to stop them before they did something stupid or Jeremy, who keeps putting himself in the middle, got himself killed. But it seemed that Katherine knew that they were planning something and had a witch bind us together. Anything that happened to Katherine happened to me.”“Hence the blood-soaked shirt?”She nodded. “Exactly. Turns out the witch Katherine was using is actually Bonnie’s cousin, so when she found all this out, Bonnie’s cousin turned on Katherine and knocked her out with a jinxed moonstone. Damon thought dumping her in the tomb was poetic.”“I suppose it is. She had everyone convinced she was locked in that tomb.”“You said you had run-ins with her before?” asked Elena.“I have. Didn’t know who she was initially. I panicked because I thought you had become a vampire. It was only after that I was told about the whole doppelganger thing.”“It is weird.”“Yeah, it was hard to separate you two at first. But once that bitch opens her mouth, the differences between you both is obscenely obvious.” Alex reached over and grasped Elena’s hand.“Why did you never tell me any of this?” asked Elena. “Did you not trust me?”Alex reached out and took Elena’s hand. She squeezed her fingers and said, “It had nothing to do with me not trusting you. You are my little sister, blood or not, and I trust you with my life. But when I found out about all this, I thought it was insane. I could barely comprehend it myself. How was I supposed to explain it to you when I didn’t understand it.”“You could have come back and explained it,” she said.“You’re right; I could have. But things changed. It was safer for you all if you continued on your lives without knowing anything about the supernatural. It’s the same reason you haven’t told Jenna.”Elena frowned. “Well, she knows now. You told her.”“I told her about witches. I think I’ll leave the vampire details up to you.” Alex patted her hand.“Great, thanks,” snarked Elena.They both laughed softly.“I will admit that I can’t tell you everything; there are things that I don’t want to share with anyone,” said Alex, “but I want you to know that I am here, first and foremost, to keep you safe. I will kill anyone I have to keep you safe.”Elena nodded her head. “Alright, I believe you.”Alex smiled. “I’m glad.” *** Alex had left Elena with Stefan, and it had probably been one of the hardest things she’d done. Leaving her sister alone, with a vampire that had a history of being a ripper, was more terrifying than any vampire she’d ever faced. The nerves in her gut had told her not to trust him, but with every moment she watched Stefan with Elena, Alex found herself unable to deny that they loved one another. It wasn’t something she would ever want to admit.But leaving Elena there had to be done. Alex had other things she needed to do that required no witnesses. Mainly dealing with Katherine.After driving away from the Salvatore’s home, Alex pulled over and decided it was best to call Renee and not waste any more time.“An update already, colour me surprised,” said Renee.“Hello, to you too,” said Alex.“Do you have the moonstone?” asked Renee. She never was one to beat around the bush.“Yes.”“Wonderful. And Katherine?”“Sealed in a tomb.”“Interesting. I thought you would have just killed her.”“I didn’t put her there; I found her stuck in the tomb with the moonstone.”Renee laughed. “How interesting? I feel like I need to come to Mystic Falls and experience this town myself.” She let out a small sigh. “Did you kill Katherine?”“I was in the middle of turning her to ash when she claimed to know how to kill an original.”“You sound like you don’t believe her.”“I don’t know what to believe. She was about to die; someone that desperate would say anything.”“But…”“But she, out of all vampires, has a very good reason to kill Klaus. It would make sense that she has learnt something after all this time.”“Well, there you go. Get whatever you can out of her; once her usefulness runs out, kill her.”Alex wasn’t really surprised. The Council would prefer to kill Klaus, or any Original, over Katherine any day. She may be over five hundred years old, but to kill an Original vampire would change everything.“Oh, and Alex?”“Yeah?”“If you think you need help, just ask.”“I will.”Alex didn’t like to admit that she would need help, but a lot was happening, and she was on her own. It would probably work out better, for everyone, if she had some assistance.
  
    Chapter Text
    There were a few details that Alex was still trying to sort out. Renee had told her exactly what to do, get the details out of Katherine and then kill her. There was no way that the Council would be allowing the vampire bitch to live after how many lives she had destroyed. Alex also had no desire to see Katherine free; she wanted her dead almost as much as she wanted to destroy Klaus.The real trouble that Alex was facing was getting to her end goal of keeping Elena safe. She knew that she could call James and ask for his help, but how did she explain his sudden presence along with the other witches he would surely bring. Elena knew about the Council, the very basic details about them, and Alex had explained what she could to Jenna and Jeremy, but she knew that there was no way the Salvatore’s would allow her to involve more witches. It seemed Damon was determined to get between Alex and Elena, believing Alex was against them like everyone else.In a way, Alex knew she was. The vampires were the enemy, no matter how Elena looked at them. Stefan, Damon, Caroline; all of them needed to die. No lives would be needlessly destroyed if vampires didn’t exist.But there was one thing that Alex was counting on. She knew that to get Katherine to corporate, she would need help; from Elena’s recounting of the events that had transpired since Katherine’s return to Mystic Falls, it was clear that Katherine still loved Stefan. She needed to somehow get Stefan involved without letting him know that he would be the leverage Alex wanted to use against Katherine. Threatening one of her precious Salvatore brother’s would hopefully get the bitch to keep the bullshit to a minimum.The first step was to involve Stefan. The younger Salvatore had been more than willing to meet up with Alex to help her protect Elena. All Alex had to mention was her sister’s name and safe, and Stefan was rushing out the door.To save time, Alex had dropped him her location, just above the tomb that Katherine was trapped in. She hadn’t gone down to see the older vampire just yet, but Alex knew that Katherine would be able to sense her. It gave Alex a small hint of satisfaction that Katherine was pinning for freedom that only a witch like her could give.Alex sat on top of one of the crumbled sections of wall, her legs tucked beneath herself. She’d pulled out her grimoire to pass the time, not really knowing how long it would take Stefan to arrive. She had barely glanced across the spells before her when her phone rang. Alex smiled, seeing Jamie’s name flashing on the screen.She said, “Hey, how are you?”A heavy sigh came through the phone; James said, “I’m good. You never call me back. I was a little worried.”Alex cringed. She’d completely forgotten that she had abruptly ended her conversation with James when she’d found Katherine. Everything had spiralled from there.She said, “Right, I completely forgot. I’m fine, I swear. Things just weren’t as straightforward as I expected.”James said, “I’m glad. Renee mentioned that you found moonstone as well as Katherine.”She nodded. “I did. I have it safe and sound.”He asked, “Does that mean you’ll be coming home soon?”“No. I had a run-in with Elijah; some vampires kidnapped Elena hoping to buy their freedom by handing her over.”“Is she okay?”“Elena’s fine, physically. We the help of her vampire friends, I was able to save her and bring her home.”A soft chuckle echoed through the line. James said, “Never in a million years would I ever believe that you would work alongside vampires.”Alex snorted out a huff. “I don’t have much of a choice.”“You could just kill them all. I can come down and help?”“As much as I love hunting vampires with you, I don’t want to completely destroy what relationship I have left with Elena.”“She’d forgive you; you’re her sister.”Alex sighed, closing the grimoire in her lap and pressing her head into her hand. “I haven’t been her sister in a very long time.”“That sounds like you’ve given up.”“Not given up. I love Elena—and Jeremy. But I’m not the girl I was when they were a part of my life. I think they will both want me to be, but after everything that has happened, the things I’ve done and seen—I don’t think I can be that person again.”It would make everything easier if Alex knew that there was no turning back. If Elena and Jeremy wanted nothing to do with her, then she could do what she did best and kill every single vampire. There would be no need for concern about what they thought if Alex was already certain they would never accept her again.But there was hope. Elena wanted to connect; she could feel it. Their sisterly bond was still there, and Alex wanted nothing more than to keep her safe. Jeremy was another story; he was hurt and craving the closeness of his family—even if he would never admit it.James pulled Alex from her thoughts and said, “If they love you, they’ll accept you for who you are. Just like I do.”She smiled. “I love you too.”“Now, what’s the plan?” he asked.“Katherine is trying to exchange information for her freedom. Renee wants me to find out what she knows and then go from there.”“Are you going to torture it out of her instead?”The snap of feet on twigs made Alex look up. Across the ruins stood Stefan, a stoic look of concern etched across his face. He stilled as they locked eyes. Alex could see the doubt in his eyes, along with curiosity and need.Alex said, “No, I’m going to give her what she wants.”“Seriously?” asked James.Alex smiled at James’ surprise and Stefan’s frown. She said, “I could use your help.”“Done, I’ll get the next flight.”“Great. I’ll see you soon.” She ended the call and pushed the phone into her pocket. She climbed off the wall and said, “Thanks for coming.”Stefan nodded. “You said you had a plan to keep Elena safe.”“I do. But it will require you keeping your mouth shut.”“Why?” he asked.Alex crossed her arms over her chest. She explained, “Katherine claims to know how to kill an original. Now to get that information, she wants to be granted her freedom.”“We already killed Elijah; Klaus can’t be that much harder.”Alex rolled her eyes. “Elijah isn’t dead.”“We drove a stake through his heart, he died—impaled on that wall.”“Original’s can’t die from just any wooden stake. You incapacitated him, temporarily. But he will heal and come looking for Elena. We needed to find a way to stop him and his brother before he gets here.”“How can you be certain he’s not dead?”Alex clicked her tongue. She had a choice; she could make up some bullshit excuse or tell the truth. It always seemed to be one or the other. If she admitted to Damon that she hunted vampires for a living, he’d probably try and kill her, but Stefan wanted to keep Elena safe just as badly as she did.Alex said, “Because I spend day after day learning the best way to kill vampires; if all it took to kill an original was just a simple wooden stake, there wouldn’t be any original vampires.”Stefan’s frown deepened.“I hope you are judging me; you, of all vampires, have no right to judge.”Stefan shook his head. “Should I be worried that when I turn my back, you’ll shove a stake into it?”Alex smirked. “No. You’re safe, for now. As is Damon and Caroline.”“If you want to kill us all, why ask for my help?” he asked.“Katherine isn’t just going to corporate. I’ll need your help in getting her to give me the information I need.”“Katherine won’t tell either of us anything.”Alex’s smirk only widened. “You’d be surprised what someone will do with the right motivation.”Turning from Stefan, Alex headed down to the tomb. The door was still lying on the floor, and Katherine was sitting on the ground, eyes closed. Her skin was slightly pale, but she didn’t look too worse for wear.“What motivation exactly is going to make me tell you what I know?” asked Katherine. She opened her eyes slowly, blinking to adjust to the bright light.Alex shrugged. “You tell me.”Stefan joined Alex, his eyes looking over Katherine.“Stefan, how nice to see you,” said Katherine. “How’s Elena?”“She’s fine, no thanks to you,” snapped Stefan.Katherine smirked.“And if you wish to remain alive, Katherine,” said Alex, “you are going to tell me what you know about killing an Original.”Katherine let out a scoff. “Not until you let me out.”“I’m not letting you out till you tell me.” Alex crossed her arms over her chest.“I tell you, you don’t let me out.”“If I let you out, you take off before you say anything.”Katherine sighed. “I guess we are at an impasse.”Alex shook her head. “I guess I’ll have to do it my preferred way. Negotiating is always boring.”Katherine and Stefan both looked at Alex with a frown. But Katherine’s frown quickly disappeared as she clenched her head and let out a cry. She curled into herself on the ground, her nails digging into her head.“Tell me what I want to know, Katherine,” said Alex.“Let me out,” she screamed.Alex increased the pain. “How do I kill Klaus?”Katherine cried.Stefan took a step forward. “Is torture really necessary?”Alex broke her lock on Katherine.Katherine gasped out in relief.“I thought you wanted to protect Elena; to do that, we need to know what she knows,” said Alex.“She probably doesn’t know anything; she’s been running from him for five hundred years,” said Stefan.Alex laughed. “You may be right about that, but there is normally consequences when it comes to stopping Originals. Katherine probably can’t kill Klaus herself, which is why she hasn’t done it. That, or she is scared of whatever it is.”“Or maybe she has another plan.”Katherine groaned. “Or maybe, I know what it means to have leverage.”Alex stepped closer to the tomb; she knelt down so that she was eye to eye with Katherine. The way the vampire leant away from her, almost like she was scared, made Alex want to laugh. She said, “Give me a reason to let you out, and I will.”Katherine swallowed and seemed to contemplate. She glanced between Alex and Stefan for a moment. Then said, “I know where to find Mikael.”Alex kept her face clear of the surprise that lept in her chest.“Who?” asked Stefan.“Mikael,” said Alex, “the vampire that hunts vampires. The ultimate vampire hunter.” She stood and turned. “Story is that Mikael possesses the only weapon able to kill an original vampire. But no one has seen in him awhile.”“That’s because a witch locked him up, and I know where,” said Katherine. She had pushed herself to stand and was leaning against the wall.“Where?” asked Alex.“No. I told you that, now you let me out, and I will give you his location.”Alex huffed. “Fine.” She opened her bag and pulled out her grimoire. She opened the book and flipped through it before stopping. “But before I let you out, there’s one small spell I need to do first.”Katherine took a step back.“Don’t worry, it won’t kill you. Just link you to me.”“Why would you do that?” asked Stefan.Alex smirked. “Because the second I drop the barrier, she is going to run, and this will stop that from happening.”Katherine glared at her but didn’t speak.Placing her grimoire on the floor, Alex lifted her hand and Katherine was pulled forward. She was pressed against the barrier and struggled to try and pull herself away. Alex pulled a small knife from the pocket in her bag and stepped over her grimoire to run the blade across Katherine’s palm.“No,” Katherine hissed.Alex smiled at her before stepping back, releasing Katherine and allowing her to stumble away. With the bloody knife in one hand, Alex started to chant. “Te deserant circumda me. Te deserant circumda me.” She used the knife covered in Katherine’s blood to cut into her own palm, allowing their blood to mix together. “Te deserant circumda me. Te deserant circumda me.”The cut on Alex’s palm healed over. She smiled, “Now, let’s you out of there, shall we?”Katherine was leaning against the wall, her eyes wide with fury.“Bonnie needed other things to draw on when she did the spell,” said Stefan.Alex nodded. “I came prepared, don’t worry.”“I thought you weren’t planning on releasing me?” sneered Katherine.“I wasn’t. But I always carry the essentials.”Alex laid out the three candles she kept in her bag. With a quick flick, the candles caught alight, and Alex took a deep breath before closing her eyes. “Terra Mora Vantis Quo Incandis, per Vasa Quo Errum Signos.” The flames around Alex grew larger. “Phasmatos selvus Terra Mora Vantis Quo Incandis, per Vasa Errum Quo Signos. Phasmatos selvus nos ex malom terra mora Vantis Quo Incandis per Vasa Quo Errum Signos. Terra Mora Vantis Quo Incandis.”There was a moment of silence before Alex opened her eyes. Katherine had moved and was reaching her hand forward. When she found no resistance, relief flooded over her before she glared at Alex.It wasn’t hard to know what exactly was about to happen. Katherine charged at Alex, grabbed her by the neck and slammed her against the wall. She bared her teeth before leaning towards her throat. Before she could bite down, Katherine let out a painful cry and stumbled back. As soon as she released Alex, the pain stopped.“I told you, we are bound. You can’t hurt me,” said Alex.Katherine sneered. “I’ll find a way, don’t worry. But for right now, I’ll see you around.” She disappeared with a flash.Alex rolled her eyes.“I thought you said she wouldn’t be able to get away,” asked Stefan. He looked at Alex with a strange expression.“She can’t,” said Alex.She knelt down to collect her stuff, stuffing it into her bag before heading up the stairs. Stefan followed.“So this Mikael person, the hunter. How does he have a weapon to kill Klaus?” asked Stefan.Alex said, “Mikael isn’t just a hunter; he’s an Original too. In fact, he supposedly Klaus’ father.”“Wait? What?”Alex laughed. “Do be so surprised. Not everyone has great relationships with their parents; you should know what it’s like.”Stefan paused as they reached the top. “Why do you say that?”Alex adjusted the strap of her bag and turned to look at him. “I probably know more about you than Elena does. You have quite the story.”The woosh of a vampires movements made Stefan look up; his surprise was comical. Alex turned to see Katherine pause, her eyes clenched furiously, and her own confusion was clear.“No,” she snapped, “what is happening—I can’t…”“I told you, Katherine. No running,” said Alex. She offered a patronising smile. “Now, let’s go find Mikael, shall we?”
  
    Chapter Text
    Spending time with Katherine Pierce wasn’t exactly ideal. Alex had bound them together to keep Katherine from running, but the vampire was determined to make every moment painful for Alex. Stefan had agreed to go with Alex to find Mikael; he could keep Katherine somewhat in line, even if it was only to keep her distracted from annoying Alex. But there was one person they were waiting for.James had promised to jump on the next flight, and he had. Alex knew he wasn’t alone; he had sent Alex a message to tell her that Sarah and Robert were coming with him. Sarah was James’ younger sister; she was a great witch but tended to get herself in a little trouble. Robert was a witch that both James and Alex had worked with a lot; he was smart, a genuinely nice person, and would do whatever was needed to help. It was three people that Alex could trust, and they would help her deal with everything.James was meeting Alex on the side of the main road the lead into Mystic Falls. Sarah and Robert were taking another route and would catch up with them later. Sarah and Robert’s job was to keep an eye on everyone while Alex left town to find Mikael.Alex leant against the hoof of the rental car that she had been driving. Katherine was laid across the back seat and hadn’t stopped moaning about how bored she was. Alex was about ready to break the vampire’s neck and stuff her in the trunk. Stefan had walked away from them to call Elena; he had no intention of leaving town without giving her a small headups. Stefan had mentioned something about lying, but Alex didn’t see what they were doing as lying. She was doing what she said she would do, find a way to keep Elena safe.Still, Alex wasn’t surprised that when Stefan turned to head back towards the car that a text came through on her phone.
  Stefan said, you found a way to kill Klaus.
Alex sighed. She sent; Maybe. Katherine talks a lot.
  Will you be back for dinner? Jenna wants to know.

  I’ll try. I’ll let you know if it takes any longer.

  Stay safe.

  I will.
Alex hoped that it wouldn’t take long. The sooner she was rid of Katherine, the better.“How much longer?” groaned Katherine.Alex rolled her eyes and ignored her.“I’m seriously the boredest I have ever been.”Alex glanced at the time on her watch and then up at the road. James should be too much longer.“Elena told me to tell you that she doesn’t want us to take any unnecessary risks,” said Stefan. He stopped by the car and placed his hand on the roof.“I somehow think what I feel is unnecessary, and what Elena thinks is unnecessary is very different,” said Alex.“You know what is unnecessary?” Katherine sat up and stuck her head out of the car window. “Standing around. What are we waiting for?”Alex glared at her. “I will seal your mouth shut if you don’t stop talking.”A soft honk sounded from a black SUV coming down the road. Alex’s mood instantly improved as she noticed James sitting behind the wheel. She pushed off the car and stepped toward him.James pulled the car over and climbed out, a wide smile on his face. “You are a sight for sore eyes.”Alex laughed. “It’s been two days.”James shrugged. “Two days too long.”They met in the middle, and James didn’t hesitate to kiss her. His hands coming up to cup her cheeks, his thumb gently stroking the skin beneath. Alex’s heart fluttered slightly at the sweet touch, her own hands reaching up to hold onto his wrists.“I think I might vomit from the cuteness,” mumbled Katherine.Alex ignored the vampire and only broke the kiss after a few more lingering moments. “Maybe two days is too long.”James smiled only widened. “So,” he said, “road trip?”Alex nodded.“Where are we heading?” he asked.“Katherine hasn’t been that helpful as of yet.” Alex reached to take James’ hand before turning back to face the two vampires, waiting for them. “Do you feel like sharing?”Katherine smirked and pulled herself out of the car. She flicked her hair over her shoulder and flashed her lashes at James. “I remember you,” she said, “and how delicious you were.”James’ smile didn’t falter. “Remember it well, vampire. You won’t get another taste.”“Can we keep the aggression to a minimum, please?” asked Stefan.“Stefan Salvatore, aka The Ripper. Who would have thought that you would one day you would change your diet to animal blood?” questioned James.Stefan’s jaw tightened slightly. “It’s safer for everyone that way.”“Let’s keep it that way,” said James.“Alright,” said Alex, “enough bonding. Katherine, where is Mikael?”“We are going to South Carolina,” Katherine answered. *** There was a small part of Alex that had wanted to laugh when about an hour into their road trip, Stefan was the one who turned to Katherine and snapped her neck. The doppelganger vampire hadn’t stopped spouting nonsense since they had started; on and on, she went, bringing up Elena, Klaus, Damon. It was all to annoy them, they all knew that, but Alex was used to ignoring bullshit. But it seemed that Stefan had the lowest breaking point.The moment that her neck cracked, they all let out a sigh of relief. The car fell into blissful silence, only breaking when James turned the radio on to fill the car with a low level of rock—his preferred choice.It was moments like this that Alex looked fondly back on; there were many times that she and James had driven for hours at a time, hunting down vampires that lived in all sorts of different places. They would sometimes be away for days, finding small moments to enjoy themselves and forget just for a second what they were really doing.It had been less than two months prior that Alex and James had been sent to a small town in the middle of nowhere Texas; the population had been less than five hundred, and strangely, a series of animal attacks had popped up. Alex and James found a nest of three vampires overindulging in the younger of the population. After trapping the trio inside the house they had overtaken and then burned it to the ground, they had taken the long way home, stopping to see the sights, make love in crappy hotels, eat some great food.It was those moments that made Alex feel a little more normal.From the backseat, Stefan’s phone rang.“Hey, is everything okay?” he answered. “I think we are about thirty minutes away—if Katherine isn’t lying to us, then I think we will make it back—are you okay?—how?”“What’s going on?” asked Alex.Stefan looked up, and their eyes met. The fear in them made Alex’s stomach tighten.“Are you sure?” asked Stefan. “Alright—I will—I love you.”Alex was ready to dial Elena and find out what had just happened. “Stefan?” she nudged.“Elijah showed up at the house,” he said.“Is everyone okay?” Alex asked.“Do we need to go back?” asked James.Stefan shook his head. “No, everyone’s fine. Elijah apparently said that he didn’t want to hurt Elena, that he wants to keep her safe.”Alex sank into her chair. “Yeah, until Klaus shows up and kills her.”“Elena seemed to think there was more to it,” he added.“Alex?”She turned to look at James.He said, “We can go back; just say it.”Alex wanted to. She wanted to rush back to Mystic Falls and keep Elena safe. She wanted to make sure that no one got hurt, that Jeremy was safe, that Jenna would be safe. There were too many people at risk.Instead of answering James, she pulled out her phone and dialled.Robert answered on the third ring. “Hey, sick of James already?”Alex wanted to laugh, but she couldn’t. “I need you to do something for me.”“Anything,” he said.“I need you to reseal my family home. No invitation without a special exception,” she said. “No vampires, werewolves, witches or humans.”“What are you doing?” asked Stefan.“Only let my family inside until I get back.”“On it.”“Thank you.”Alex hung up and closed her eyes.“What did you do?” asked Stefan again.“I am making it so no one can get into our home. Even with an invitation, no one is getting past that threshold, not without my say so,” she explained.Stefan shifted in the backseat. “Can we stop for a bit? I need to get out of this car.”Alex didn’t argue, so when they approached a gas station, James pulled in. The gas station was connected to a bar with a few cars parked outside, but it was rather quiet. Stefan was the first to climb out of the car before heading straight towards the bar. Alex climbed out and walked away from the car to sit down on the curb.Sitting there, she pulled up her knees and rested her forehead on them. She let out a heavy sigh. It was easier to get things done when it wasn’t personal. She needed to find Mikael, wake him up and convince him to help them kill Klaus. But now, all she could think about was Elena; if Elijah was in Mystic Falls, he could be up to anything. Robert would reseal the house, and while they were inside, they would be safe, mostly. But there would be no chance of keeping Elena, Jeremy and Jenna all inside. Elena and Jeremy had school, as did Jenna, and they all had lives they would want to keep living.Alex wished she could shake off the fear; fear led to doubts, and doubts meant mistakes. It wasn’t something she could afford.James’ hand came to rest on her back. He took a seat beside her and rubbed her back soothingly.He said, “Call her if you’re worried.”Alex sighed. “It’s not just that.”“I know,” he said, “you don’t like being on the offensive.”“I am constantly worried about what’s going to happen to her.” Tears pooled in her eyes. “I left so that she could live a normal life and not have to be surrounded by what my magic attracts. This wasn’t supposed to happen.”“Maybe it was,” said James.Alex frowned. “What do you mean?”“You and Elena were both taken in by the same family. The chances that you both ended up in Mystic Falls is so small. Maybe you were brought together so that you could protect her.”Alex wanted to shove him and laugh, it sounded absurd, but nature did have a way of making things go her way.“Either way,” James continued, “we will keep her safe. Now call her, talk to her. I’m going to grab some snacks.” He pressed a kiss to the side of Alex’s head and jumped up.Alex watched him walk away before pulling out her phone. She rang Elena and only relaxed once she heard her voice. Elena told her how Elijah showed up and inserted himself into Mystic Falls as a historian. He had even tricked Jenna, who hadn’t put the dots together. Only after she had invited him in and Elena came home did she pick it all together. But Elijah hadn’t hurt anyone; there were no threats, merely an offer.Elijah swore that he would keep everyone safe, everyone Elena cared about would remain unharmed, and all Elena had to do was go about her life and leave Klaus to him.To anyone else, it would seem like a decent deal. But Alex noticed how there was no promise to keep Elena safe or alive. It bugged Alex, but she didn’t say anything to Elena. What mattered is at the moment, while Alex wasn’t there, Elena was okay, as was everyone else.
  
    Chapter Text
    Charlotte.Another small town, similar in many ways to Mystic Falls, but without the heavily celebrated founder obsession. It had been the destination that Katherine had directed them to, and when she finally woke up—after having her neck snapped for the second time—she told James to drive to the large cemetery that sat on the furthest side of town.Alex found her eyes watching the people that they passed as James drove. Stefan had been almost silent since they had continued on from their short pitstop, and Katherine seemed to grow more uncomfortable the closer they got to the cemetery. Alex took a moment to prepare herself; somehow, she knew that locating Mikael wasn’t going to be as simple as walking over and there he was.The sign for Charlotte Cemetery was hanging from a very old gothic-styled fence. James drove into the parking area that was well tended and maintained. As he parked the car, Alex was the one who climbed out and looked around. There was no sign of a single human insight, and it was almost too quiet for her to relax.Without waiting for the rest of the group, Alex lifted her bag over her shoulder and walked towards the lines of graves. The immediate area was well trimmed and clean, fresh flowers lying on every other grave. Alex glanced around and noted that Mikael would probably be sealed in a mausoleum and not buried. She paused and turned to see James standing at the back behind Katherine and Stefan.Alex locked her gaze on Katherine. “Where is he?” she asked.Katherine glanced around; her movements were fidgety.Alex laughed and ran her fingers through her hair.“What’s funny?” asked Stefan.“She doesn’t know,” said Alex.Stefan glared at Katherine. “You said you knew where he was.”Katherine sneered at Alex and said, “I do. Charlotte Cemetery.”“Just not where in the cemetery,” added James.Alex shook her head. “I really shouldn’t be surprised.”Looking around at the surrounding area, Alex took a moment to see what stood out. The witch that concealed Mikael would want to make sure he wasn’t accidentally discovered. There would be magic protecting him and his location, and magic always left signs and traces.“I brought you here; now let me go,” snapped Katherine.Alex shook her head. “Yeah, I don’t think so.”With a twist of her wrist, Katherine’s neck snapped, and she dropped to the ground.“Stefan, would you mind bringing her please,” said Alex.Stefan seemed surprised but bent down and picked up Katherine, slinging her over his shoulder. “Where do we start?” he asked.Alex rolled her shoulders. “Magic leaves a trace; I just need to find it.” Closing her eyes, she let out a steady breath. Holding up her hands, she chanted, “Magica, magica, liceat videre.” Warmth flooded her hand, and as she opened her eyes, a ball of white light floated in front of her.“Wow,” mumbled Stefan.Alex smiled at the light before blowing it out of her hands. It floated through the air and towards James; it hovered around him before shooting off in another direction.“Come on,” said Alex. She followed after the light.The light led them through the cemetery to a mausoleum. It backed onto the very edge of the cemetery was the area immediately around it was overgrown; weeds had sprouted everywhere, as had wildflowers.The closer they got, Alex started to feel the spark of the magic that surrounded the small structure. She smiled as she stopped and watched the light fade.“Why is this so overgrown?” asked Stefan.“The witch put a diversion spell around it,” explained James. “Any humans who got too close would without reason for thought simply turn around and walk away.”“The witch who put him here wouldn’t want anyone to accidentally find him,” added Alex.She stepped towards the doors and placed her palm on the door. She gasped at the small shock she received.“The outer door is sealed,” she said.James stepped forward and took Alex’s hand. “Together?”She nodded.They both placed a hand down and closed their eyes.“Patentibus.”The doors swung open harshly, slamming against the walls. Inside the structure was a dark room. Alex waved her hand, and the old candles flickered to life, lighting the room. In the centre of the small space was a coffin made from concrete, and Alex hoped inside would be Mikael.Stefan stepped inside after them and frowned. “It’s so clean.”Alex smirked. “Preservation spell, wouldn’t want the cage falling apart.”She placed her hand on top of the coffin and pressed against the lid. It didn’t budge, but there was no magic sealing it. “It’s not sealed,” she said.Stefan moved to place Katherine down on the floor; he stepped around James. “Allow me,” he said. He lifted the lid and then pushed it off, allowing it to crash onto the floor on the other side.Inside of the coffin lay a bound desiccated vampire. The chains vibrated with magic, enough so that Alex’s stomach was twisting in discomfort. The witch that bound Mikael really didn’t like him.Alex stepped closer, and the desiccated vampire’s eyes snapped open. It only made her smile.“Hello, Mikael. I need your help to kill Klaus,” she said.The flash in the vampire’s eyes only confirmed that it was him. The story of Mikael hunting Klaus always went on about how much he hated and despised him; the pure hatred and disgust that was almost glowing on Mikael’s grey face made that evidently clear.“Don’t worry,” said Alex, “I have something to perk you up a bit.” She turned to James, who stepped towards Katherine.“What are you doing?” asked Stefan.“Mikael doesn’t feed on human blood,” explained James. He lifted up Katherine and held out her wrist.Alex pulled out the small knife she carried and sliced it through Katherine’s wrist before pressing it to Mikael’s mouth. “He only feeds from vampires.”Katherine’s blood dripped onto Mikael’s lips; they parted ever so slightly to allow the blood to fall down his throat, bringing colour slowly back to his face. A gasp came out of Mikael, and he lifted his head, his vampire visage breaking out across his face, and he latched onto the bleeding wrist. After a few moments, Mikael released Katherine’s wrist and let out a groan. He kept his eyes focused solely on Alex.He said, “Many have tried to kill that beast; what makes you think you will succeed?”Alex placed her hand on top of the chains that bound him. “Because I don’t just want to kill him; I need to.”Mikael’s face remained neutral. “Very well.”“Wait,” said Stefan.Alex looked up.“What is to stop him from killing us all once you free him?” he asked.Mikael laughed. “Nothing, but from the desperation I can see on all of your faces, you don’t have much of a choice.”“I thought you wanted to keep Elena safe?” Alex asked Stefan.He nodded. “You know I do. I would die if it meant keeping her safe.”“This is how we do that.”Stefan frowned but nodded. “Alright.” *** Alex had stepped away from the mausoleum once Mikael had climbed from his coffin. She found herself feeling more anxious than before. She had taken a moment to sit down in the grass beneath one of the large trees that provided an abundance of shade in the cemetery. She had yet to update the Council, or Renee, that Katherine had led them to Mikael or that she had woken him up. There would probably be a few who would have been against such a move. But Alex found herself feeling a little desperate.Mikael had been right when he said it was desperation driving them. Never before had Alex been so determined to stop a vampire, and it wasn’t just the want that was pushing her. It was the need. She needed to keep Elena safe.Running her fingers through her hair, she let out a heavy sigh. The gravestones surrounding her were only making her more anxious as she remembered the last time she had been in a cemetery. It had been for her parents funeral.On one side stood Elena, Bonnie and Caroline on either side of her, hugging her as she cried. Jeremy was on her other, his hand clenched in Alex’s as they both cried silent tears. Alex had spent three days holding herself together to help Jenna; the funeral had come together quickly as their parents had already prepared for such a thing, but Elena was still healing from the accident, and Jeremy had become a recluse. Alex had no idea what to say to any of them.It was the same night that Alex left. She knew it had been the cowardly thing to do, but she ran. Taking off without a word, leaving a letter with her apologies. James had picked her up from the airport and spent the next two days consoling her as she grieved.For weeks, Alex pushed the pain and the memories of her family away and focused on what she was good at, killing vampires. And it seemed that she had never really stopped. It was probably James’ own stubbornness that kept him around; Alex knew that he loved her, but she knew how difficult she could be.“You’re friend seems to have reservations about working alongside me.”Alex looked up at Mikael. Besides his old clothing, he looked alive again.“I don’t really care, and he isn’t my friend,” said Alex.Mikael smirked. “Semantics.”“How do we kill Klaus?” she asked.“You don’t. I do.” Mikael rubbed his hands together. “With a stake made from the wood of the Great White Oak tree.”Alex nodded. “Great, where is it?”Mikael shook his head. “I don’t keep such a weapon on me. It’s in a safe place.”Alex scoffed. “You’ve been sealed in a tomb for the last twenty years. Do you really think it’s still in the same place?”“Yes.”The laugh of disbelief that came out of Alex brought a frown to Mikael’s face.“You don’t have much faith in others, do you?” he asked.“You’re a vampire.”“You travel with a vampire, two in fact.”“Not willingly.”“But you trust that your goals align; therefore, you believe they won’t harm you.”“I’m not scared of them—or you.”“Never said you were, my dear. My point is that we both want to kill Niklaus; believe that my hatred for him and my desire to end his life is far greater than yours.”“Fine,” she said, “go find your stake. Then meet me in Mystic Falls.”“Is that where Niklaus is located?” he asked.Alex shook her head. “Not yet. But that’s where the doppelganger is; he won’t be too far away.”Mikael nodded. “Very well.”He disappeared with a flash, leaving Alex alone beneath the tree. She looked up and spotted Katherine walking out of the mausoleum with Stefan; she held onto Stefan’s arm and looked weak.James followed out after them and stopped when he saw Alex. He moved towards her, holding her bag in one hand. “You alright?” he asked when he reached her.Alex stood and nodded. “Yeah, Mikael will meet us back home.”James nodded.“I can’t believe you fed me to him,” complained Katherine; she stumbled slightly. “I need blood.”Alex said, “Get over it.”James chuckled. “Let’s head back to Mystic Falls.”Alex nodded. “I’ll meet you at the car; need to make a phone call first.”James nodded and direct Stefan to lead Katherine away. Only once Alex was sure they wouldn’t be able to listen in did she pull out her phone and called Renee.“Tell me some good news,” answered Renee.“Mikael is awake and is going to help us kill Klaus,” said Alex.“Fantastic. And Katherine?” she asked.“Barely alive. Mikael almost drained her dry.”“Pity he didn’t. The Council stated that Katherine was only to remain alive as long as she remained useful. If she doesn’t slip away, which the Council understand is a possibility and won’t hold it against you, kill her.”Alex smiled. Receiving the kill order for Katherine Pierce had her feeling better about everything.“My pleasure,” she said.Alex ended the call and walked back through the cemetery to the car park.By the car, the three of them waited. James was leaning against the hood of the car, his eyes watching Katherine, who was leaning against the fence looking worse for wear. Stefan was standing a few feet away, talking on the phone. Alex guessed that he was probably telling Elena they were headed back.Katherine looked up and glared at Alex as she made her way over to James. She asked, “Were you always going to feed me to him?”Alex shrugged. “It wasn’t so much planned as convenient.”Katherine sneered and charged towards her.Alex didn’t even have to react; James did, using his magic to bring Katherine down to her knees in a crumbling mess. She screamed out in pain, causing Stefan to spin around. Katherine trembled at Alex’s feet, tears swelling in her eyes as she clenched her head.“I think we’ve reached the end of our deal,” said Alex.James released his spell, and Katherine sagged onto the ground, panting for breath.“I gave you what you wanted,” she said.Alex nodded. “You did.”“So let me go,” snapped Katherine.Alex laughed. “I think not.”James stepped up behind Katherine and grasped her shoulder. Katherine hissed and reached up to hit James but froze when a wooden stake punctured through her back and into her heart. Katherine grasped the tip of the stake that was now protruding out of her chest, and she tried to catch her breath. It only took a few moments for Katherine’s skin to go grey and for her to collapse into a heap.“That was anti-climatic,” said James.Alex sighed. “Tell me about it.”Stefan made his way slowly over to Katherine’s corpse. His jaw clenched, his face twisted into an unexplainable expression. “You killed her?”Alex wanted to roll her eyes and tell him to get over it, but there was something surprising in Stefan’s face. She thought that perhaps he might feel regret or pain; after all, he had supposedly loved Katherine once upon a time. But he looked almost relieved.“She was never going to outlive this,” said Alex, “she should have died over five hundred years ago.”Stefan nodded. “Am I next?” He looked up from Katherine’s body.If he was any other vampire, Alex wouldn’t have hesitated to kill him; or maybe even made a snide comment that his time would come. But she didn’t. Instead, she shook her head and walked towards the car.She said, “Someone bury the body, and let's get going.”
  
    Chapter Text
    The drive back to Mystic Falls seemed to take longer than the drive up. Without Katherine, the ride was silent, besides the soft rock that James had playing. Alex found herself taking the time to contemplate the next step. There was still so much happening that could cause a number of outcomes, and Alex didn’t like that.With Mikael awake, it meant that Alex could start to formulate some kind of plan that could lead Klaus to his death. She wanted to keep Elena out of it as much as possible, but knowing Elena, that probably was going to be difficult. Alex knew that she could rely on Stefan and Damon to keep her out of immediate danger.It made Alex want to scream when she realised that she was allowing vampires to keep her sister safe, but for the moment, they weren’t the biggest threat she was facing. Alex needed to deal with Klaus first, then she could remove the supernatural threats completely from Elena’s life.At least with Katherine gone, there was one less vampire that Alex needed to consider. What she did need to consider was the other people or supernaturals in Elena’s life. Caroline was one of her best friends; separating them would be almost impossible without killing Caroline. Bonnie would probably be the only supernatural being that Alex would accept as part of Elena’s life; as a fellow witch, she wasn’t a constant threat like vampires were, but Alex was still hesitant.James reached the ‘Welcome to Mystic Falls’ sign and pulled his car over. Alex’s rental car was still parked by the side, and she would need to drive it back home. As soon as the car stopped, Stefan climbed out and disappeared without a word. She had no idea what he would tell Elena, but Alex would make sure to explain her side once she got back home. But that was once she had the full story about Elijah.That was the other problem; Elijah had his own plans; whatever they were, Alex was going to need to keep him away from Elena and not allow him to learn that Mikael was awake and ready to kill Klaus. Alex also really wanted to know his plan; why was he in Mystic Falls without Klaus? Why was he allowing Elena to stay in Mystic Falls? Alex thought that Elijah would have grabbed her and dragged Elena kicking and screaming back to Klaus. But maybe he wanted every piece of the puzzle first.“Robert is waiting for you outside your house. He said that your family are aware of the boundary spell and that Bonnie has been trying to break it,” said James.Alex sighed. “I’ll explain once I get back. I have a lot to explain.” She rubbed her face and opened the car door.James reached over and took her hand. “We are keeping her safe,” he said.Alex smiled and nodded. “I know. I just wish this was simple.”“Like every other hunt?” he asked.“Yeah. No complications, just find, kill, clean up.”James smiled. “Family is always complicated.” He squeezed her fingers before releasing them. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”Alex leant across the centre console and kissed him. “Love you.”“Love you too.”James waited until she was in her car before he drove off, heading into town to meet up with his sister, Sarah, at the bed and breakfast they had checked into. Alex started her own car and headed straight back to the house.When she arrived, Robert was sitting parked across the street. He climbed out of his car and met her in the driveway as she parked.“Who have you allowed in?” she asked.“Only your family,” said Robert.Alex nodded. “Thank you.”Robert squeezed her shoulder. “No problem. That Bennett witch that is friends with your sister, she has been giving it a good crack to get in.”Alex smiled. “Bennett witches are strong, but she’s untrained.”“Someone with strength like her could do a lot for the Council,” said Robert.Alex shrugged. “Maybe, but we aren’t here to recruit witches.”“I know, but maybe she could use some guidance. After all, we all benefited from it.” Robert squeezed her shoulder again before leaving.It hadn’t really been something Alex had even worried about since she’d been back. It had only been a few days, but Bonnie was a witch, a powerful witch. One that seemed to be caught up in vampire business with no way out. Alex knew that what Robert said was right; she should help the young witch guide her. But for the moment, she had a probably very annoyed family to deal with.Inside, Jenna was in the kitchen, Jeremy and Elena were sitting at the set dinner table. They all stopped as she walked inside and looked at her.Elena jumped up from the table and asked, “Someone has put a spell around the house; no one can get in but us.”Alex nodded. “I know.”“Can you break it?” she asked.“Yes, but I’m not going to,” said Alex.“Why not?” asked Jeremy.“It has been put up to keep you all safe.”Elena crossed her arms over her chest. “How is locking everyone out going to do that?”Alex explained, “Only those who we allow in—or should I say—those who I allow in can enter. Supernatural or human, I decide who gets to come in.”“Why do you get that choice?” snapped Elena, her jaw clenching as she spoke.Alex frowned. She said, “Because I am your older sister, the house is in my name, and I am keeping you safe.”Elena shook her head. “Bonnie and Caroline aren’t going to kill me, neither is Matt, or Stefan, or Damon—”“Bonnie and Matt are more than welcome to come inside; I’ll give them access. But no vampires are coming through that door.” Alex moved past Elena and into the kitchen.Elena followed, seemingly ready to argue.“Elena, Alex is right,” said Jenna. “I accidentally let Elijah in today; what if Klaus is invited in next?”Elena shook her head. “They won’t hurt me, please.”Alex hated the hurt she could see in Elena’s face, but she had to put her foot down. In the short time that Alex had been in Mystic Falls, Elena was constantly in danger.“Elena, I’m not doing this because I enjoy it.”“Really? Because from the moment you came back, I have seen the way to react when Stefan’s around, same with Caroline and Damon. You hate them, and you don’t even know them.”“They’re vampires, Elena,” exclaimed Alex. “They are an abomination of nature. Surely Bonnie has explained that much to you.”“Bonnie doesn’t hate vampires simply because they are vampires. She trusts Stefan, Caroline, too. She has reservations about Damon, but she has reasons for that.”“And what would those reasons be?” asked Alex.Elena swallowed.“What did Damon do to her?” Alex pressed.“He almost killed her,” said Jeremy.Alex placed her hands on the counter. “Vampires are monsters. They want one thing and one thing only and will do whatever they can to get it.”Elena shook her head. “You’re wrong. They aren’t all monsters.” She turned and left the kitchen, her feet hitting the stairs as she stormed upstairs.“Are we all stuck in here?” asked Jeremy.Alex shook her head. “No. You still have to go to school; I can’t keep you all trapped in here. But at least we can all feel somewhat comforted by the fact that we are safe in this house.” She glanced over to Jenna, who was staring at the chopping board. “You seem very calm,” she said.Jenna sighed. “I’m processing. I think by tomorrow, I’ll be in freak out mode.”“When did Elena tell you?” she asked.“Not long before Elijah showed up.”Alex nodded. At least Jenna wasn’t being lied to anymore.It wasn’t how Alex had wanted the conversation to go. She originally thought she would let Stefan in the house; it meant he could protect her. But keeping them all out, separating them all, meant Elena would constantly be in danger around them. Alex had also believed that Elena would be, for the idea, a safe house where no one could get in.It seemed, however, that Elena saw Alex’s intentions differently. Apparently, Alex hadn’t been as good as she had thought about hiding her dislike for the vampire species, unless…Stefan had probably called her once he had left them. What had he told her? *** Elena didn’t join them for dinner. Jeremy had tried to convince her to come down, but she didn’t budge. Alex knew that Elena was going to be mad, they didn’t agree on the vampire subject, and Alex was starting to believe that they probably never would. It was possible that Alex would never be able to free Elena of the supernatural and keep their relationship intact. All Alex could do was try and explain her point of view.Alex carried Elena’s dinner upstairs after they had all finished and cleaned up. Jenna was working on her dissertation, and Jeremy had parked himself on the couch. Pausing outside of Elena’s door, Alex contemplated leaving her be. Sometimes it was good to let others deal with their emotions first, but time was short. Alex needed to work with Elena for everything to turn out okay; she couldn’t have her sister running off.She knocked on the door and waited.There was no response for a solid five seconds, but Elena did pull the door open. The anger on her face was evident.“I don’t really want to talk to you,” said Elena.Alex nodded. “I know, and you can hate me all you want. But right now, we need to be on the same page.” She held out the plate of food.Elena sighed and took it. She walked back over to her bed and sat down in the middle.Alex stepped inside Elena’s bedroom and closed the door. The room hadn’t changed much over the years, but photos had been added, as had the picture hanging over her bed. There were photos of their family, her friends, of Stefan. The picture that sat by her bed was probably the one that stood out the most. Elena was snuggled into Stefan’s chest, their arms around each other. The beaming smile on their faces showed how happy they were together.“The first time I fort a vampire was the day I left Mystic Falls—the first time.” Alex sat down on the edge of Elena’s bed. “I had no idea what he was, but he grabbed me and fed on me. He was killing me. I was lucky because my magic, uncontrolled as it was, lashed out and hurt the vampire. It was injured enough that the vampire took off, leaving me wounded and terrified.”Elena looked up from her food with a frown.“Renee found me; I had been heading to meet up with her when he’d grabbed me. She had to tell me what had happened and that I needed to learn how to fight back so that I could protect those who couldn’t.”Elena pulled her knees up to her chest. She said, “Stefan isn’t like that.”“Maybe not now, but he used to be.”Elena sighed. “I know he has a past; everyone does. But if we were all blamed for how we messed up, no one would ever move on. And Caroline, she never wanted to become a vampire. She was dying, Damon did something selfless and tried to help her—for once—and then Katherine killed her to get back at me.”Alex shifted on the bed and sat beside Elena. She said, “I don’t want to argue; I hate it. I just want you to understand why I don’t think I’ll be able to accept Stefan. Or Caroline.”Elena huffed. “You could if you just tried to get to know them. See how hard they fight to keep everyone safe, to control their urges.”“It’s not just about that.” Alex reached over and took Elena’s hand. “Has Bonnie ever explained to you how she can tell someone is a vampire by touch?”Elena nodded.“I can tell by just being around them. From a distance, my magic can sense the supernatural; vampire, werewolf, witch. My magic reacts in different ways depending on who it is. Witches give me warmth, comfort. Werewolves are like pins and needles, that fuzzy sensation. But vampires, it’s like my gut twists and turns, like it’s tearing itself apart.”“Sounds painful.”“It can be. For some vampires, my reaction is stronger than others. The longer I’m around them, the more accustomed I become. But it’s like my whole body is rejecting them, screaming at me that they can’t be right.”“I can’t even imagine it.” Elena leant her head on Alex’s shoulder. “I’m sorry I yelled at you.”“I’m sorry too. I just want you to be safe.” Alex leant her head against Elena’s.“I know, but I love Stefan, and he would never hurt me.”Alex let out a big sigh and closed her eyes.“I never wanted this for you—I thought that if you could just live a normal life, then you would never have to know about the horrors that are in this world.”Elena said, “I think my life stopped being normal the day our parents died.”“Doesn’t mean you can’t try and have one.”“Alex, I know what you are trying to do, but I’m not normal. Even if I married a human, I’m not normal; I’m a doppelganger.”Elena was right. Her whole existence was a supernatural occurrence, nature’s loophole. Her life was always going to be surrounded by the supernatural, no matter what anyone did. No matter how much Alex wanted to keep her safe, she couldn’t control those who would come after her, who she fell in love with.“I’ll let them in,” said Alex.Elena looked up, shocked. “Really?”Alex nodded. “Stefan and Caroline, but not Damon. I don’t trust him at all.”Elena frowned. “He’s difficult, impulsive.”“That’s putting it lightly.”It was a step, Alex wasn’t sure in which direction, but Alex just wanted to keep Elena safe. She would need help to stop Klaus, and if she could rely on vampires to keep her sister safe while she focused on the big bad, then Alex was going to learn to deal with it. Personal issues aside, it wasn’t about her.
  
    Chapter Text
    The next morning, Alex sat on the front porch. She was the first to wake up and found herself wanting nothing more than to go back to sleep. But her mind was wide awake, and she was restless. So she got up and made coffee. Alex had finished her first cup while standing in the kitchen before walking outside and taking a seat on the front steps. She watched as the street woke up; people went out running, headed off to work, collected the paper. A few faces that she remembered from her teens waved as they passed by; she was polite and offered them a smile but stayed where she was.Alex’s coffee was running low when she heard the first signs of life inside. Most likely Jenna, but Alex still stayed out on the front porch. It wasn’t too long later that a car pulled up.Bonnie climbed out of the car with a determined look on her face. Against her chest, she held an old book; Alex smiled; she had her grimoire.Swallowing the last mouthful of coffee, Alex said, “Good morning.”Bonnie stopped a few steps away. “Hi.”Alex smiled warmly. She had nothing against Bonnie; if anything, she would have liked them to work together. “Do I frighten you?” she asked.Bonnie shook her head. “No, but I don’t trust your intentions.”“Why?” Alex put the empty cup down beside her.“You locked everyone out of the house. It seems like you are isolating Elena from her friends,” she explained.Alex nodded, understanding how it could appear that way. “I suppose that could be one explanation, but what I was actually doing was making it so no unwanted visitor could get inside.”“But no one can get in, not just vampires. I couldn’t get in, Matt couldn’t.”“You can now.” Alex stood and picked up the cup. “I had the house spelled to make sure that no one could trick their way inside. Even if a vampire compels Jenna, Jeremy or Elena to invite them in, they won’t get in. Only those who I allow through can get inside.”“Who you allow?” Bonnie asked.Alex said, “Who I allow. At the moment, that consists of myself, Elena, Jeremy, Jenna, yourself, Matt, Caroline, Stefan and Alaric Saltzman—who I have yet to meet, but Elena insisted.”“Not Damon?”Alex frowned. “No. He’s too impulsive; he might do something stupid.”Bonnie seemed frozen while she took it in.“Why don’t you come in and have breakfast? You can ask me anything you like over pancakes.” Alex moved towards the door, pausing to wait as Bonnie made her choice.Inside, Jenna was drinking coffee and reading over a paper at the dining table. She smiled at Bonnie and Alex as they walked in.“Morning,” she said.“Good morning, Jenna,” said Bonnie.“Nice to see you can come in again,” said Jenna.Alex sent a small frown at her Aunt. “I was always going to let Bonnie back in.”Jenna shrugged. “I wasn’t judging.”“No, just stirring.” Alex moved into the kitchen and started to pull out what she would need for pancakes.Bonnie took a seat at the kitchen island and placed down her grimoire.“I wasn’t joking about the questions; you can ask me anything,” said Alex.“How did you find out you were a witch?” she asked.Alex said, “I set fire to my bed, exploded a few windows.”“Really?”Alex laughed. “Yeah, scared the shit out of me. Not all of us can have a Grams who can help us.”“I thought Grams was crazy at first,” said Bonnie.“Anyone would. It’s not exactly something you see or hear about every day.”“Elena said that it was how you found out you were adopted.”Alex nodded. “Magic doesn’t run in the Gilbert family, I checked. Discovered that Miranda and Grayson took me in after my mother died.”Elena appeared in the kitchen, dressed for school. “Morning,” she said.“Morning,” said Bonnie.“You never told me what happened to your mum,” said Elena. She leant against the kitchen counter beside Bonnie.Alex was quiet for a few moments. The story of her parents wasn’t exactly clear, there were many details that she didn’t know, but there was some that she did. She said, “Grayson found my mother’s car after she’d been in an accident. My mother was stuck in the front seat, a piece of metal had gone straight through her, and she was dying. I was in the backseat, crying. I was only a few months old. My mother’s dying words begged Grayson to keep me safe.”Jenna stood up from the table and walked to the kitchen. “I remember the night Miranda called me. She was terrified because she had no idea what to do with a baby.” Jenna smiled and laughed. “But she was so excited.”“Have you looked to see if you have any other family?” asked Elena.Alex sighed. “All dead. Father deceased before I was born. Grandparents too.”Bonnie asked, “I wonder if your mum was a witch?”Alex smiled that she did know. “She was. After discovering the truth, I learned that Grayson had kept the stuff recovered from the car. One of the books he kept was her grimoire.” She walked around the island towards her bag that was sitting on one of the dining chairs. She pulled out the grimoire she carried with her everywhere and moved to place it down on the island counter.Bonnie smiled. “It’s great that you have something that belonged to her.”Alex nodded. “It helps me feel a connection to her.”“What was her name?” asked Elena.“Prudence Ravenwood. She was a school teacher.” Alex ran her hand across the grimoire’s cover. “I have no idea if she was a part of a coven or if she practised regularly, but I’ve accepted that it’s probably something I’ll never know.”“I wonder if you look like her?” asked Elena.Alex shrugged. “Somewhat; I get my hair and eyes from her. I think the rest is from my father.”“I suppose the blonde hair combined with the green eyes makes more sense now,” said Elena.“That it does.”Moving back around to measure out the ingredients, Alex watched as Bonnie started to flip through the grimoire. Her hands carefully ran over each page, her mouth moving as she read the spells and instructions. Alex liked the look of awe that had overcome Bonnie’s face.The girls chatted and talked more about what had happened in the last year for all of them. Relationships became the main topic of conversation once the pancakes were done and they were all sitting down.Alex had turned the conversation to Jenna’s current relationship with a certain history teacher slash vampire hunter. Alaric Saltzman had yet to show his face since Alex had returned home, and she was curious about the man that seemed to have captured everyone’s hearts.“Alaric is a great guy,” said Jenna.“Everything with Isobel is cleared up now?” asked Elena.Jenna nodded. “It is getting there. Now knowing that Isobel left Ric to become a vampire is easier to digest than him possibly being responsible for her disappearance.”Alex smirked. “Yeah, we don’t need a crazy serial killer in the family.”The girls laughed.“No,” said Jenna, “I think witches and vampires are enough.”“What about you?” asked Bonnie. “Anyone special in your life, Alex?”Alex couldn’t stop the smile that graced her face when she thought of James. He had been her biggest rock since he had entered her life; she found it difficult to imagine ever making it through everything that had happened without him.“I take that look as a yes,” said Elena. “Who is he?”Alex sighed; there was no harm in them knowing. “His name is James, and he is a witch in my coven.”“Do you have a picture?” asked Jenna.Alex laughed as they all leaned in. She unlocked her phone and pulled up one of the more recent photos that Sarah had snapped of the two of them. It had been a few weeks ago after a rather long few days; Alex had been exhausted and hadn’t been able to keep her eyes open. Snuggled up against James’ shoulder, he had a wide grin on his face as he looked past the camera to Sarah.Elena sighed. “You two look so cute; when do I get to meet him?”Alex took her phone back. “Soon, maybe.”James had sent her a message when she had woken up that Sarah, Robert and he were all set up in their motel. Robert had been locating all of the supernaturals in town, ticking off Elena’s friends as he went. It seemed that for the moment, there was no one in Mystic Falls that they didn’t already know about, but that could change quickly.As Elena and Bonnie started to clean up from breakfast, the doorbell rang. Jenna jumped up from her seat and walked over to answer it. Alex watched her Aunt as she pulled open the door. Alaric Saltzman stood before them; a genuine look of love covered his face as he locked eyes with Jenna.It made Alex happy that her Aunt had found someone who looked at her in such a way.“Ric, it’s about time you meet Alex.” Jenna led Alaric from the door towards the kitchen. “Ric, this is Elena and Jeremy’s older sister, Alex.”Alex stood up from her chair and reached out to shake his hand.Alaric said, “I have heard so much about you.”Alex smiled. “I don’t doubt it. It’s nice to meet a fellow hunter.”Alaric’s face paled. “What?”“Oh, right,” said Jenna, “I didn’t tell him that part.”“The part that your other niece is a vampire hunter? That part?” Alaric asked.Jenna shrugged.“I’m more of a witch than just a vampire hunter, but, yeah.”Alaric nodded, his confusion not seeming to fade. “A vampire hunting witch—nice.”“I am curious how you found yourself, as a vampire hunter, friends with vampires,” said Alex. She sat back down at the table.Scratching the back of his head, Alaric said, “It wasn’t the plan. I only came here originally to find the vampire that I thought killed my wife.” He cleared his throat and seemed to have trouble with what to do with his hands.“Technically, Damon still killed her,” said Elena.“Well, yes. He did.”The room grew silent. An awkwardness seemed to hang in the air. Jenna and Alaric both glanced at each other before sitting down.“So, Alex,” said Alaric, “you’re a witch.”Alex nodded.To say the following twenty minutes of conversation was strange was a little understated. Alex could tell that Jenna and Alaric were still sorting out their relationship; bits and pieces of truths that were still yet to come out seemed to be explained as they talked about Alex and everything that had brought her back home. Alex excused herself once the girls left for school, followed by Jeremy, who only grabbed his bag and disappeared—trailing after Bonnie with a strange look on his face.Alex had a few things to take care of, and her first stop would be the motel where James was.She drove across town to the bed and breakfast Sarah had chosen and spotted Sarah sitting out the front on the brick wall that lined the parking lot. Sarah smiled widely as Alex climbed out of her car.“Thank god,” she said, “I don’t think I could stand being alone with those boys for another minute!”Alex laughed. “Always so dramatic.”Sarah shrugged. “It’s what I do best.” She flicked her blonde hair over her shoulder.The two of them shared a tight hug before Sarah led her towards the front door.Sarah said, “Robert did another spell this morning to see if anyone new has shown up; I think for the moment, it’s all clear.”Alex nodded. “Good.”“James mentioned that you’ve told your family everything.”“Not everything, but Elena is aware of how I feel about her boyfriend and his species.”“Maybe they aren’t all that bad,” said Sarah, looking away from Alex.Alex knew that Sarah didn’t believe what she and James did. Sarah had grown up surrounded by the Council and their rules, but she still developed a strong independent opinion of how she viewed the world. Sarah was careful who she voiced her thoughts to, but she also refused to completely join the Council. While she lived under James’ roof, she mainly did her own thing.Alex said, “I’m sure when they were human, they would have been great people, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t driven by their desire for blood.”Sarah sighed, “I know.”“Stefan, out of all of them, has a very bloody past.”“Isn’t he the vampire trying to make it surviving on animal blood?” she asked.“Yes, and while I hold a tiny amount of respect for his attempt at being better, his own being is driven by desire. Sooner or later, he will crack.”They reached the door of their room, and Sarah pulled out her keycard. She let them in to find Robert sitting on the floor, a map of Mystic Falls before him and candles placed around him. James was sitting on the armchair in the corner with his laptop on his lap.“Morning,” Alex smiled. She placed her bag on one of the beds and walked over to kiss James.“Good morning, how’d things go with Elena?” asked James.Alex frowned. “As good as they were going too. We understand one another.” She walked over and sat on the bed.Robert opened his eyes. “This is why I have always been happy that I’m an only child.”Alex said, “You complain all the time that you want a little brother.”Robert scoffed. “Don’t put words in my mouth, Ravenwood!”Alex laughed and rolled her eyes. “Don’t call me that; it’s Gilbert.”“Your family might be the Gilbert’s, but your witch heritage is Ravenwood. Embrace it!” Robert closed his eyes and took a deep breath.“Have you told your family about your blood family?” asked Sarah.Alex nodded. “A little. They know the story of how I ended up a Gilbert. No the part when my mother was running from vampires and was murdered by them.”“It might help them understand a little more,” said James.“Maybe.” Alex pushed back her hair. “Enough of the emotional, let’s get down to business. We have an Original to kill.”
  
    Chapter Text
    The plan was in pieces but coming together. Alex was waiting on something to happen, but things seemed quiet. The weekend had consisted of planning, family time, and realising how much Alex had missed the simple life of Mystic Falls. The things she didn’t miss were the town events and how, as a Gilbert, she was expected the attend.It seemed that the Historical Society was throwing some event. A gathering where the Gilbert’s were expected to make an appearance at; Elena had explained to Alex that what was really happening was the town’s council—a group of the founding families—were coming to discuss the supernatural. It seemed that no one from the Gilbert family had been a part of the town’s council since their parents had been alive—except for John, but no one had seen him since Katherine cut off his fingers.Alex found herself standing in front of a mirror, looking at herself. She hadn’t really packed for parties, meaning she raided Elena’s closet. She pulled out a dress that had originally been hers. It was a soft pink satin dress that she had worn to her eighteen birthday party. It had been one of her favourites, but she had left it behind when she had left Mystic Falls. Alex had put it on and was surprised when it fit as perfectly as she remembered.Running her fingers through her hair, Alex huffed and grabbed the black heels she had also borrowed from Elena.Downstairs, Jenna was waiting with Elena and Jeremy. Elena looked up first and smiled when she saw Alex. “You look great.”Alex smirked and did and small twirl. “It still fits.”Jenna said, “Perfectly. It hasn’t been that long since you wore it.”Alex said, “My eighteen birthday; so—four years.” She smoothed down the skirt.“Okay, we are all pretty. Can we go already?” asked Jeremy.Elena nudged his shoulder, but Alex laughed.“Yes, we can go,” said Jenna.It seemed that the event was being held at the Lockwood’s home, which wasn’t uncommon. By the time they arrived, there was a cue of people walking towards the large home.Alex frowned as she climbed out of the car. “Why are we here again?” she asked.Elena stepped up beside her and linked their arms. “Because we are Gilberts.”Alex rolled her eyes.“And because you wanted to find a way into the Council?” she added.That was true. After learning about the town’s secret council, Alex wanted to know what they knew. The first step was getting into the meeting, which apparently Damon had somehow wormed his way into.They walked up to the front door and followed the crowd in. Alex noticed the stares she was getting from people she had known years ago. People who had known their parents, who she hadn’t seen since their funeral. Walking in with Elena, Alex made a reach for the first drink she saw. As she turned to go with Elena to find the Salvatore’s, they were stopped by Carol Lockwood.“Elena, welcome. And Alexandra, it has been quite a while since I’ve seen you.” Carol smiled brightly, but the curiosity was shining in her eyes.Alex returned a polite smile. “Hello, Carol.”“When did you get back to town?”“About a week ago.”“Visiting?”“Yeah, thought I should check in on Elena and Jeremy and make sure they haven’t made Jenna pull all her hair out.”“How nice.”“It has been.”“Elena, would you excuse us for a moment?” Damon stepped up beside them.Elena nodded. “Sure.”Alex glanced as Elena walked off, leaving her alone with Damon and Carol. Elena had assured Alex that Damon would get her into the council’s meeting, but Alex was still wary of the older Salvatore. He hadn’t been pleased when he had learnt that he was banned from the Gilbert house and that Alex was the one behind it.“Damon, what can we do for you?” asked Carol.Damon smiled. “Carol, Alexandra—as the eldest Gilbert—would like to represent her family on the council.”Alex wanted to smack him at the use of her full name.Carol’s eyes widened. “Oh! I wasn’t aware you knew about it.”Alex smiled. “I’m sure there are many things you aren’t aware of.”If her comment offended Carol, it wasn’t obvious. Carol kept her smile in place and said, “The meeting will take place within the hour; you can join us then.”Alex nodded. “Wonderful.”“Excuse me,” said Carol.As she turned away, Alex dropped the smile and glared at Damon. “Use my full name again, and you’ll regret it.”Damon sneered. “I just got you into the council, witchy! You should be nice to me.”Alex scoffed and walked away. She didn’t want to put up with him any longer than she had to.The Lockwood’s home was full of people, many that stopped Alex as she walked through. They were all so curious about where she had been, what she had done with her life and if she was back for good. Alex had never lied so much, but the lies came easily as she made up a boring story about needing a new start after losing her parents.Alex was relieved when she finally managed to get away from all of the noisy neighbours and find Elena. She was standing with Jenna, talking to Caroline. Alex’s grabbed Elena’s arm and said, “I remember why I hated these so much.”Elena laughed.“You are the hot topic at the moment,” said Caroline.Alex frowned.“Your sudden return after your very sudden disappearance has everyone talking,” finished Caroline.“Well, it is really no one’s business,” said Alex.“You’ve been away from small towns too long; you sound like a city slicker,” teased Jenna.“Excuse me, ladies.” Alaric stepped up beside Jenna. “Alex, we have a meeting to attend.”Alex nodded. “Alright, let’s do this.”“Have fun,” smiled Elena.Alex sighed. “Yeah, it’s going to be real fun.”The town’s council all met in what appeared to be Carol’s office. Members from all founding families stood around the room, Carol at the front with the Sherrif—Caroline’s mum—beside her.“Welcome all,” said Carol. “To start off our meeting, we are welcoming Alexandra Gilbert to the Council today.”Alex offered a warm smile and leant against the wall beside Alaric. Damon stepped towards them and stood beside her, too close for her liking, but she stayed silent and listened as the council discussed what they considered important.They talked for only thirty minutes, by it was thirty minutes that Alex would never get back. The council knew nothing of use.Alex stepped out of the party and pulled out her phone. She made sure she was far enough away before she called James.“Having fun?” he asked as he answered.Alex sighed. “No. The town council knows nothing. It seems that Damon is making sure they all remain clueless.”“It’s always amusing how blind people can be,” chuckled James.Alex explained, “It’s the daylight rings that have them all convinced. They don’t know anything about witches or even werewolves. Vampires are the only supernaturals they are aware of.”“At least they won’t get in the way.”“I don’t know about that.” Alex rubbed her neck. “Anything on your end?”“Seems all-clear for the moment.”“Good.”“Who you talking to, Witchy?”Alex clenched her jaw as she turned to see Damon. He was smirking at her and leaning casually against a tree a few feet away.The time she had spent around the eldest Salvatore had been brief, but Alex had come to dislike him in that time. Damon was rash, unpredictable and seemed determined to try and control Elena’s decisions. It was clear that Damon wanted to protect Elena, but he would do it without thinking about the consequences or what Elena would want.Alex understood the desire to protect regardless of consequence; Alex would have been happy to kill each vampire in Mystic Falls—even if it broke Elena’s heart—to keep Elena safe, but she knew there was another way. Her end goal was the same, but if Alex needed to be patient, she would be.“I’ll call you back,” said Alex. She hung up her phone. “Ever heard of private conversation?”Damon pushed off the tree. “Vampire; nothing’s private to me.”Alex crossed her arms. “You really are a piece of work.”“Says the control freak.”“What do you want?” she snapped.Damon leant in close and said, “To chat. Be friends. Maybe get to know each other.”“You’re disgusting.” She pushed him away and moved to walk away.Damon followed and said, “No, I’m charming.”“Get lost, Damon.”“Let me back into the house.” He sped in front of her.Alex tensed, ready to make him regret his choices. She said, “No.”“We are all on the same side. We need to work together.”“I’m keeping my sister safe.”“No, you want to isolate her. How am I supposed to keep her safe when you don’t let me inside the house?”“You are what she needs to be kept safe from. If I could, I would have kept out all vampires out.”“You really hate us, don’t you?”“I don’t hate you. I’m repulsed by you,” Alex spat.Damon turned his head, his eyes calculating. “Does Elena know how you feel about the man she loves and her best friend?” he asked.Alex closed the space between them and got in Damon’s face. She wasn’t going to let him think that he intimidated her or that she would back down. “Yes, she does. Because unlike you, I’m honest about my feelings.”Damon frowned. “What is that supposed to mean?” “You really think I’m blind? You don’t want to help keep Elena safe because she’s your brother’s girlfriend; you love her.” It disgusted Alex that she had noticed the way Damon watched Elena. His eyes followed her wherever she went. “It’s rather pathetic how you follow her around like a lost puppy dog. Maybe I should put you out of your misery?”Damon cringed as Alex focused her magic on him. He groaned and grasped his head. “Seriously?”Alex released him.He gasped and sneered at her. “You bitch.” His hand shot out and grasped Alex by the throat.Alex grasped his arm and dug her nails into his skin. His hand was squeezing hard enough that her brain realised she couldn’t get enough oxygen and started to panic. Alex tried to gasp for breath but couldn’t. She tried to focus and ignore her bodies panic and stop Damon. She focused her magic again, and Damon’s grip wavered slightly but not enough to get her relief. Alex clenched her teeth as she tried to stop him; she wasn’t going to let a pathetic vampire like Damon kill her.The tingle across Alex’s skin made her look past Damon to see Bonnie and Elena.“Damon! Let her go!” yelled Elena.Bonnie ran up behind Damon and placed her hands on either side of his head. Damon screamed out in pain and released Alex. Both of them gasped for breath; Alex stumbled backwards and coughed as she dragged air into her lungs.“What the hell are you doing?” asked Elena. She stepped in between where Damon and Alex. “Are you insane?”“She attacked me,” said Damon.Alex shook her head. “No, you’re just insecure and unpredictable. I wonder why I would never trust you around Elena?”Damon looked between the three girls before taking off. Leaving Alex under Elena’s disappointed frown.“What?” asked Alex.“I thought we agreed that we would all work together, including you and Damon?” asked Elena.“Don’t blame me for his psychotic behaviour,” said Alex.“Elena, Damon is always like this,” added Bonnie.Elena sighed, “I know he’s difficult.”“That’s putting it mildly,” said Bonnie.Alex walked over and took Elena’s hands. “You have always seen the good in everyone, even vampires.” She squeezed their hands. “But Damon is going to cause more trouble than he’s worth.”Elena clenched her jaw but didn’t respond.“I’m going to head home before the bruises on my neck are seen by anyone,” said Alex. “I’ll see you later.”Elena nodded.“I’ll give you a ride,” said Bonnie.“Thank you.”Alex walked with Bonnie away from the Lockwood’s. Neither of them spoke as they got into Bonnie’s car and drove back home.As Bonnie pulled up out the front, she broke the silence and asked, “Why don’t you just kill Damon?”Alex almost laughed. Any other situation, and she would. “Have your own thoughts about Damon, do you?”Bonnie let out a heavy sigh. “Damon’s tried to kill me once before; because of him, my Grams died, and all of the tombs vampires got out.”Alex reached over and took Bonnie’s hand. She said, Believe me, I’m tempted.”“Is it because of Elena that you don’t?” asked Bonnie.“Yeah. For some reason, she sees something in him. I don’t know if she simply feels sorry for him or because of Stefan, but he will get someone killed.” Alex leant her head back against the seat.“If Elena listens to anyone, she will listen to you,” said Bonnie.“I think this is something we will never agree on.”They said their goodbyes, and Alex walked up the path. She was going to need a shower to get the feel of vampire off her skin before she healed the bruises that were already forming on her throat.She unlocked the door and paused when she felt it. Alex turned as her skin seemed to burn, but not in an uncomfortable way. It was unlike anything she had ever felt before. Turning around, Alex froze as she took in the person—or she should say vampire—standing before her.Elijah Mikaelson was standing with one hand casually in his pocket and a small frown on his face. “Nadia?”
  
    Chapter Text
    Nadia Ravenwood, a name that Alex had only heard on one occasion. When she had first started looking into her birth parents, Alex had followed her mother’s surname. Ravenwood was a line of witches supposedly connected to the Salem witch trials, but since then, not much had been documented about them. Alex had searched for months for anything, but the only thing she could find about her family was that her mother, Prudence Ravenwood, had been an unmarried school teacher who had died in a ‘car accident’. Her parents, father was unknown, but her mother was Nadia Ravenwood, a witch whose last know location was New Orleans. There was no documentation of death, nothing beyond the birth certificate for Prudence.To hear her grandmother’s name spoken from the lips of an Original was—surprising. Alex hadn’t expected it, and she hadn’t really expected Elijah to call her Nadia.“Not my name,” said Alex.Elijah took a step forward, moving so quickly that he stopped right in front of her. Alex reacted to his movement and brought up her hand. He surprised her by grabbing her hand and holding it still.Alex gasped as their skin connected, and the buzzing on her skin that had alerted her to Elijah’s presence seemed to grow. The buzz was warm and—disturbingly so—comforting. The look in Elijah’s eyes told Alex that he too was surprised by whatever sensation he could feel.“You were the witch that attacked me,” he said.Alex glared at him. “You kidnapped my sister.”“Technically, I didn’t.”“Technically, I didn’t attack you.”An amused smile touched Elijah’s face. “You wouldn’t happen to be related to a Nadia Ravenwood, would you?”“Why?” asked Alex.“You look like her, sound like her too.”“You say that like you knew her well.”Elijah nodded. “I did; she was perhaps my closest friend.”Alex realised that Elijah was still holding her arm. She pulled back from him and frowned. “Why are you here?” she asked.Elijah straightened his suit jacket. “To talk to the doppelganger.”She scoffed. “I highly doubt that.”“Why do you say that?”“You’re Elijah Mikaelson, an Original vampire. You have been looking for a doppelganger for a thousand years to hand over to your brother so he can break his curse. What are you going to talk to my sister about? Her choice of full moon that she will die on?”“Someone’s done their research.”Alex didn’t like the whole situation. Elijah seemed so relaxed, standing on the porch talking to her. It was also unnerving her that her body wasn’t reacting like it normally would have around a vampire. Her body would normally be tense, and her magic would be thumping beneath her veins, but instead, Alex’s body was relaxed, and it seemed so was her magic.“It seems you have me at a disadvantage. You know my name, but I do not know yours.” Elijah held out his hand to her.Alex didn’t take his hand, but she said, “My name is Alexandra.”“Alexandra Ravenwood has a nice ring to it,” said Elijah.“My surname is Gilbert.”He smiled. “Of course, my apologies.” He took a step closer to Alex. “Now, why don’t you invite me in, and we can discuss your sister.”Alex laughed and pressed her back against the door. “You want to discuss my sister? We can do it right here.”Elijah nodded. “Very well.” He walked across the porch and sat down on the swing. “The doppelganger is what my brothers craves most. He has spent the past five hundred years believing that the doppelganger bloodline ended with Katerina Pierce, but alas, here is your sister, evidence that it did not. And while five hundred years ago I would not have hesitated to hand your sister over to my brother, a lot can happen in five hundred years.”The curiosity spiked inside Alex.“My brother has caused much pain and suffering to those around him, but none more so than to our family and me.”Alex asked, “So what? You want to get back at him?”Elijah stood back up. “I want to kill him.”It wasn’t something that Alex had expected to hear. Elijah wanted to kill his brother; he wanted to kill Klaus.“And what of the rest of your family?” Alex asked. “Do they want him dead?”Elijah did the button on his jacket up. “If I could ask them, I have no doubt they would share my sentiment.” He walked past Alex and back down the porch steps. “I’ll let you pass my message on to your sister.”Alex watched as he stood there for a moment before turning around.He said, “Your grandmother was a wonderful person.”“I never said she was my grandmother.”Elijah smirked. “You don’t need to, Alexandra.” *** The group meetings were exhausting. Alex was standing by the window in the Salvatore’s living room.After talking with Elijah, Alex had taken her shower, changed and healed the bruises left by Damon before calling Elena. She had already been at the Salvatore’s when Alex had called. It seemed that now Elijah was in town, it was time that everyone gathered to discuss what to do next.Elena seemed unsure of what to do as everyone else argued over whether or not to trust Elijah. But Alex found herself distracted. Instead of calling James and Renee or adding her opinion to the current conversation, Alex was rubbing her hand over the place that Elijah had held her arm. She had been unable to forget how her skin had tingled under his touch, how her body had burned with need when he had appeared. It was concerning.“Hell no!” yelled Damon. “We are not trusting this original dick!”“He wants Klaus dead, so do we,” said Caroline.“So he says,” said Damon.Alex sighed and rubbed the back of her neck. They had been going in circles for the past ten minutes, and Damon wasn’t going to budge.A hand gently touched Alex’s shoulder; she turned to see Bonnie.“You alright?” Bonnie asked.Alex nodded. “Just thinking.”“Well, why don’t you contribute instead of being useless?” snapped Damon.Alex glared at him. “You know what…Damon, I think you should go and kill Elijah. Attack him head-on. Then when he kills you, we won’t have to put up with the utter crap that comes out of your mouth.”Damon sneered.“Enough, everyone,” said Elena.“Alex, did Elijah say anything else?” asked Alaric.“No,” she said. Alex had left out the details about her grandmother; she kept the topic focused on Klaus. “He wants to kill his brother.”“But can we trust him?” asked Elena.Alex sighed. Her answer would be that she would never trust a vampire, but Elena tended to give her trust to those who didn’t deserve it—namely, Damon. “I don’t know,” she said. Looking back out the window, Alex wanted to talk to James.“I want to talk to him,” said Elena.“The second you stand in front of him, he is going to grab you and run,” said Damon, “don’t be stupid.”“Damon, it’s her choice,” said Stefan.“Her choice is going to get her killed,” snapped Damon.Alex frowned when she felt the tingle on her skin. She turned back to see Damon’s head twist around and for him to collapse to the ground. Elijah was standing behind his slumped body, straightening his jacket, a satisfied smile on his face.He said, “Now that that racket has stopped, let’s talk.”“If you want to kill your brother, what do you want from me?” asked Elena.Alex crossed the room to stand beside her sister. She was glad at that moment that both Jenna and Jeremy weren’t there.“I want you to go about living your life,” said Elijah.“What?” A course of confusion came out of everyone.“You want to lure Klaus here,” said Alex. Alex almost laughed. How hadn’t she realised it?Elijah nodded. “I think a doppelganger would be a perfect lure to bring Klaus out of hiding.”“What’s to stop other vampires from taking me like Rose and Trevor?” asked Elena.Elijah said, “If you go about your life as per normal, I can keep your existence a secret. There will be no stray vampires in desperate need of my brother’s approval trying to kidnap you.”“How do I know you’re not lying?” asked Elena.“Because if he was,” said Alex, “everyone else would be dead, and he would have taken you already.”Elijah smiled at Alex. “Exactly.”Alex felt her heart skip; she had no idea why but it made her nervous that she reacted in such a way.“I will offer you a deal,” said Elijah. “Do nothing. Do nothing, live your life, stop fighting and then—when the time is right—we shall draw out Klaus together, and I shall make sure your friends and family remain unharmed.”Alex frowned. She noted that he mentioned nothing about keeping Elena safe.“And then what?” asked Stefan.“And then I kill him,” said Elijah.“Just like that?” asked Elena.Elijah nodded. “Just like that. I’m a many of my word, Elena. I make a deal; I keep a deal.”Elena turned to look at Alex. She knew that Elena wanted to know what she thought; should she trust him? Alex had no idea. If Elijah was going to help them kill Klaus, how could they say no? Then again, Mikael was awake and would be hunting Klaus too. But there was no way to know if Mikael would find Klaus before Klaus found Elena or if Mikael would actually help them. It had been a risk waking him up; what was one more risk trusting Elijah? *** Alex was sitting in her car in the driveway of their home. She had called Renee and updated her on recent events; it seemed that the Council were willing to take the risk. Killing Klaus was more important to them than anything else, but they were also looking for opportunities to kill Elijah and Mikael as well. Alex had also updated James, and he had been ready to head over to help, but Alex had stopped him. For now, Elijah knew that Alex was a witch; she wanted to keep James, Sarah and Robert as a backup if he turned against them.It wasn’t everything with Klaus that was bothering Alex. She was ready to take action if need be, but what was scaring her was how her body reacted to Elijah. The burn on her skin and how her magic reacted to Elijah were the same way she had once reacted to James. When their relationship was new and exciting, her magic would dance with excitement when around James; as their relationship developed, it became comforting to be around James. But it made no sense to Alex why her magic was reacting that way around Elijah; he was a vampire—an Original vampire—and her body burned at his touch, her heart lept at a smile on his face. Something had to be wrong with her, or he was up to something.   Alex wasn’t sure what she should do. Initially, she considered telling James, but how would that make him feel? She was responding to Elijah the same way she responded to him. It made her feel guilty like she had done something wrong.Alex believed it was the guilt that made her drive over to James. She messaged him on her way and got his room number. When she arrived, it relieved her that he was alone.James smiled at her warmly and cupped her cheek. “Hey, you okay?”Alex didn’t say anything; she wrapped her hands around his wrists and kissed him.Their first kiss had been in the heat of the moment; both of them had been after a vampire, and they had ended up in a heap and burst into laughter. James had been lying on top of her, both of them trying to calm down. Alex had found herself not really thinking but acting. Their kiss was epic. Alex felt the fireworks, the need to kiss James again and again; her mind was constantly thinking about him. It was all very cliché, but Alex knew that it was right.But as their lips moved together and James pulled her inside his room, it felt different. Alex ignored it, ignored the doubt and forced herself to remember that the man with his arms around her was the man she loved.Elijah was her enemy.James’ touch was enough to distract her. Alex found herself falling into the familiar dance with James as she pushed him back onto the bed and pulled her shirt over her head. James was the man she loved—always.
  
    Chapter Text
    Alex hadn’t slept very well; she had been curled up against James’ side, but sleep seemed intent on invading her. James had tried to stay awake with her, talking about anything, but he had fallen asleep around two am. Alex had been fine with listening to his soft breathing as she looked out the open window.Only when the sun made an appearance over the horizon did Alex give up and get out of bed. She showered, made herself a coffee before heading home, making sure to leave a note for James.The house was quiet when Alex walked in; Elena’s bed was empty—meaning she had spent the night with Stefan—but Jeremy and Jenna were sound asleep. The quiet gave Alex some time to think; she had wanted nothing more than to forget the night before, but she couldn’t avoid what was happening.Elijah appeared to be a possibly crucial part of killing Klaus and saving Elena, meaning Alex would be unable to avoid him. They would need to work side by side.Sitting down at the foot of her bed, Alex laid open her grimoire and went through the pages. It was something she had done a hundred times before, but she was hoping to find something that she may have overlooked. Anything to help keep Elena safe and anything to kill Klaus.A knock on her door made Alex pause; she looked up to see Jeremy standing in her doorway.“Morning,” she said.Jeremy leant against the frame. “Hey, where were you last night?”Alex sighed; she hadn’t mentioned James was in town. “I was visiting a friend.”“Right.”“What did you get up to?” she asked.“Alaric made dinner.”Alex asked, “You all seem to really like Alaric.”“Yeah, he’s been great. He’s helped a lot with school, and—it’s been nice to have someone else to talk to.”“I’m glad you feel like you can talk to him.” Alex glanced back down at her grimoire and closed it. “I want you to know that you can talk to me too.”Jeremy nodded. “I know. I just figured you have your hands full with Elena—”“You’re important too, Jer.” Alex stood up and walked over to Jeremy. “If you ever need anything, even if I’m in the middle of something, I want you to tell me.”He nodded again.“Like about how you’ve been eying off Bonnie.”Jeremy frowned, a guilty look in his eyes. “What?”Alex smirked. “I’ve seen the way you look at her and how she looks at you.”His cheeks turned pink as he reached up to scratch the back of his head. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”Alex chuckled. “It’s alright, early days with you two.”“Don’t tell Elena,” he pleaded.“I won’t, but Elena does have eyes.”Jeremy sighed.“Speaking of Elena, where is she? At Stefan’s?” Alex asked.“She said something about helping Caroline, not really sure what was going on,” he explained before turning and walking towards the stairs. “I just got told to come home—like always.”Alex frowned. She wasn’t sure how to react to that. Pulling out her phone, she hoped that if something was wrong that Elena would call her. She dialled Elena’s number and grew concerned when she didn’t answer.“She might still be asleep,” said Jeremy.“Maybe.” Alex placed her phone back down and tried to remove her worried expression. “You better get ready for school.”Jeremy sighed but relented.Alex didn’t know if she was worried because she had no idea what Elena was doing or if she didn’t trust the whole situation. The one thing Alex knew was that Elena would do whatever she could to help her friends; sometimes, that meant she would get into situations that, as a human—with no way of protecting one’s self—were deadly. Alex understood her sisters desire to keep everyone safe, but it also drove her mad.She decided to message Stefan and felt the worry fade when he instantly replied that Elena was with him. And after a few seconds, Elena also sent her a message. Alex would see her after school.The rest of the morning was thankfully normal, with no concerns, just smiles and laughter. Alex made breakfast for everyone in the Gilbert house—which consisted of Alaric, who had stayed over again. It wasn’t until after Jeremy had left for school with Alaric and Jenna had raced off to college that Alex found herself standing in the kitchen contemplating what to do next.Collecting her grimoire from her bedroom, Alex decided to drive out to her favourite spot. Running alongside one side of Mystic Falls was the West Mill River. The river split off into a whole bunch of tiny streams that eventually congregated at the Falls, but if you didn’t follow the river to the falls and went the other way, it would lead you to a small pond that sat on the edge of a large open field.The field itself sat on the back of a farmer’s property but wasn’t privately owned. Alex found herself visiting the spot a lot in her youth, as no one really knew about it. It was her place of solitude, and the only other person she’d ever bought was Elena.Alex had to park her car on the side of the road and walk through the woods towards the West Mill River to follow it to her spot. Her feet seemed to remember the trail well because, without much thought, it wasn’t long till Alex stepped out into the clearing.The field was overgrown as it was often left alone, and beautiful wildflowers covered the ground. She was too far from the road to hear cars or any other sound of life aside from Nature. The water trickling along the stream, the birds hiding up in the trees, and the wind moving through the plants and grass.As Alex crossed through the grass, she let her fingers dance over the tips of the tall grass and enjoy the warm sun on her skin. She found herself immersed in what all witches should be, and that was Nature. They all claim to be servants of Nature, but Alex found that it was rare she ever truly enjoyed it.The ponds edge was damp from the water lapping at the shore, so Alex stepped over the large roots of a tree at its bank and settled herself against the base of its trunk. Her head tilted back and rested against the bark; she let the weight that seemed to be heavy on her shoulders fade for one moment. She rested the grimoire of her knees and left out a grateful sigh.Letting down her guard wasn’t something that often happened with Alex, but she found herself surprised by how relaxed she felt in a familiar place. But as she opened the grimoire and glanced down at the spells in front of her, she felt the warm tingle across her skin that reminded her why she was always on guard.Alex’s head snapped up and to the left to see Elijah standing a few feet from her. One of his hands rested in his pocket, the other by his side. He was eyeing Alex with a look of intrigue.In a normal vampire versus witches situation, Alex would have lept from the ground and attacked. But it seemed that instead of having her instincts flip out like they should, her body seemed more than happy to stay put.“What gave me away?” Elijah asked.Alex normally would have retorted with something sarcastic about vampires having a nasty stench, but it seemed that her mind and mouth weren’t attached. She said, “We may be allies, but that does not mean that I will reveal my secrets to you.”Elijah smiled and took the few steps to close the distance between them. “Are we now? I was unaware that our agreement had been made official.”“Elena and I have yet to discuss anything yet; it seems she has been preoccupied with her friends. But I do know that killing Klaus won’t be easy, and to dismiss you so quickly when you have known him for a thousand years would be naïve,” explained Alex.Elijah unbuttoned his blazer and moved to sit on the protruding tree root.“What do you think you’re doing?” asked Alex.“Joining you. Is that not obvious?” Elijah smirked and leant against the tree trunk.Alex wasn’t sure how she felt. The strange warmth she had felt around him was there, and it was making her feel uncomfortably safe around an Original Vampire of all things. It was unnerving, to say the least, but she was also curious.She asked, “Who said I wanted your company?”Elijah questioned, “Does my presence offend you?”“If it does?” she countered.He shrugged. “Then so be it. But I don’t believe this spot belongs to you, so I can stay as long as I like.”Alex’s mouth popped open in shock. This was not what she had been picturing when she had left her house to try and find some peace. And instead of arguing or protesting, she decided to look back down at her grimoire.The silence between them wasn’t uncomfortable. And for a few minutes, Alex was slightly tense as she tried to focus on going over pages that she was so familiar with. Still, as time passed, she found herself relaxing into her position and forgetting that the man beside her was a vampire with his own agenda.When the silence was broken, it was by Elijah. Alex hadn’t noticed that he had turned to watch her as she read.“If it wasn’t for the blonde hair, I would have sworn that you were Nadia,” he said.Alex glanced up. “You knew her well?”He nodded. “She helped me through a very—tough time in my life.”“What did she do?” she asked.Elijah said, “She was a friend.”“That’s it?” Alex turned her body to face him, interested even more in her grandmother.“What were you expecting me to say?” An amused smile graced Elijah’s face.Alex shrugged. “I don’t know. I don’t know anything about my blood relatives other than that they are dead.”He asked, “Your Council hasn’t told you about them? I was under the impression that the Ravenwood family was very important to them.”“You know about the Council?” Alex hadn’t expected Elijah to know such a thing. She had kept her coven and what they did mostly hidden from everyone else, but it seemed Elijah knew a lot more than he seemed.Elijah said, “I do. I knew about them before I knew your grandmother, and Nadia told me everything she did after leaving them. And don’t worry about me revealing your true occupation to your family. I have a feeling Elena would be destroyed to know that you hunt vampires for a living.”Alex had never been foolish enough to believe she could hide everything forever. Sooner or later, James would meet her family, and when they faced off against Klaus, she didn’t doubt that Sarah and Robert would be with her. But Elijah had only been here for a few days—as far as she knew—and he knew something she was careful about.Alex asked, “Wait—my grandmother was a part of the Council? She hunted vampires?”Elijah nodded. “The Ravenwood family—from what I know of its history—were one of the few families that came together to create the Council. Nadia was raised to hate vampires, taught to hunt and kill them—just like you have been trained to do.”“Why’d she leave?”“There were many reasons that lead Nadia.”It was evasive—his answer. Alex didn’t like that he seemed to be hiding things. He was the first person to ever tell her anything about her family. Renee had always insisted that there was nothing to know. The Ravenwood’s didn’t have any history. But Elijah was telling her that her family had helped create the Council; they were a part of a the few witches and warlocks that had been drawn together to fight back.“Like what?” Alex prodded.Elijah looked away from her for the first time. He said, “She didn’t agree that vampires were soulless monsters that needed to be destroyed.”Alex frowned.“Nadia came to see that vampires, while not by Nature’s design, are a part of this world. Nature’s balance was tipped when my mother took matters into her own hands, but Nature found a way to realign herself.”“And how do you believe it did that?” she asked.“For every strength, we were given, a weakness was provided.” Elijah lifted his hand and twisted the ring around his finger. “When I was human, I used to come here.” He looked out over the open field. “A herd of wild horses would pass through every year in the spring with their newest foals. I used to love watching them; every spare minute, I could find that I was able to slip away from what was expected of me to watch them graze and live so carefree.”Alex had never heard Elijah points regarding vampires existence. Witches were servants of Nature, given gifts to care for and help. The Original Witch may have created something that Nature never intended, but it found a way to persevere.“You said that my grandmother liked vampires—”“No, I never said she liked them. Nadia stopped persecuting vampires without knowing them. She was willing to help anyone; human, witch, werewolf, or vampire. Like any other species, my kind has the good and the bad.”Alex wanted to argue; she had seen so much suffering caused by vampires. Innocent humans were slaughtered, torn apart, tortured. But she had spent many years with rose colour glasses on. Her point of view was taught by Renee and the Council. She hated many things about vampires; the unnerving sensations in her gut made her want to believe that what she knew was right. But Alex couldn’t understand how Elijah could seem so human. Stefan was in love with Elena; anyone could see that just by looking at him. Caroline also seemed to be trying her hardest to be better—and not that Alex would ever say it out loud, but Caroline as a vampire seemed more in control than she ever had as a human.“What happened to my grandmother?” Alex asked. “I couldn’t find any records of her death. Her trail just ends in New Orleans.”“I have no idea what happened to Nadia; one day, I received a package with a letter from her telling me that she was thankful for my friendship. After that, I have no idea.”“I thought you were friends? Don’t friends keep an eye on one another?”Elijah frowned. “When Nadia and I went our separate ways, I agreed to not interfere with her life choices. She had a plan, wanted to right her wrongs.”“Her wrongs?” Alex couldn’t even begin to imagine what her grandmother could have done. “I can understand that.”“What wrongs could a young woman like yourself have?” asked Elijah. “You seem to have your head firmly on your shoulders.”“I not always the easiest person to deal with—you’ll find out for yourself soon.”A soft laugh came out of Elijah, and Alex tensed as her stomach flipped at the sound. Looking away from the way his eyes crinkled as he laughed, Alex tried to remember that she was hanging around an Original Vampire. She couldn’t imagine what James or hell—what would Renee do?Elijah shifted and stood from the tree branch; he said, “Well, with the amount of trouble that your sister and her friends get themselves into, I can understand your concerns and need for control. Mind you, if I hadn’t sent my associate to save your sister’s friends, she would probably stop getting dragged into so much trouble.”Alex frowned. “What do you mean?” she asked.Elijah frowned. “Last night?”Alex shook her head. “What happened last night?”Elijah sighed. “One of my associates assisted Elena with saving the lives of her vampire friends. It seems they had themselves in a tangle with a pack of werewolves.”Alex slammed her grimoire closed and stood up. “There hasn’t been a pack in Mystic Falls for over two hundred years.”“It seems they were lured to town by one wolf in particular, a Tyler Lockwood.” Elijah straightened the cuffs on his shirt. “And not long after their arrival, they learnt that residing in Mystic Falls were the ingredients to break ‘the Sun and the Moon’ curse.”Alex’s stomach turned at what might have happened without her knowing. A werewolf’s bite would kill a vampire, the venom driving them insane first. But werewolves were even more violent than vampires. They killed to survive, to feed. But wolves slaughtered anything they could because they enjoyed it.“If you are concerned for their safety, I assure you everyone is well,” said Elijah.Alex nodded. “I have no doubt that you kept your word about keeping everyone Elena cares about safe. However, my sister’s safety is the only one I’m concerned with.”Alex stepped over the tree’s roots, intending on walking past Elijah and back towards her car—she had a sister to find—but Elijah stopped her. He looked down at her with a pleased look in his eye.“Would you prefer that I let them all die?” he asked.“Why? Are you offering to slaughter your own kind? Wouldn’t that go back on your deal with Elena?” Alex asked.Elijah slipped both hands into his pockets. “I am a man of my word. But my agreement with Elena has yet to be agreed upon.”Alex didn’t like what was happening. It was tempting to take Elijah’s word and wipe out all of the other dangers around them. It would help Alex focus on killing Klaus if no other vampires—or werewolves—threatened Elena’s life. But Alex didn’t think she could do that to Elena.“The deal will keep everyone alive,” said Alex. “Everyone.”Elijah nodded and held out his hand. “I accept your term.”Alex glanced at his hand before taking it. This was the second vampire she was making a deal with; one of them better lead to Klaus’ death.
  
    Chapter Text
    There was so much rushing through Alex’s head that she wasn’t sure what to do. Meeting with Elijah—talking with him—hadn’t been something that she had ever planned. From the moment she had met the Original, things felt strange. Her reactions to him, emotionally—she didn’t want to burn him like every other vampire—and physically—her heart would skip whenever he would smile at her—were as horrifying as it was intriguing.But Alex couldn’t be worried about strange occurrences. What she needed to do—no—what she had to do was find Elena and knock some sense into her suicidal brain. Whatever had lead to the previous night’s events and had a werewolf pack looking to kill them all, Alex needed an explanation before she really did lock Elena in their house and refuse to let her out.One text to Jeremy confirmed that Elena had gone to school. Bonnie and Stefan had also shown up, but there was no sign of Caroline. But that didn’t matter; Alex would wait for Elena to walk out of school before dragging her home.Alex parked in the school parking lot and messaged Elena to meet her. She was glad that it only took a few minutes before she spotted her sister walking towards her. Alex climbed out of her car and waited until Elena was at the front of her car.“Do you have something you’d like to tell me?” asked Alex.Elena frowned. “What do you mean?”“What happened last night?”“I was with Stefan,” said Elena.“Were you planning on keeping the pack of werewolves that are after you a secret?” pushed Alex.Elena sighed. “No, but it had nothing to do with me—they wanted the moonstone.”“And why would they possibly want that?” Alex slammed her car door closed. “They believe that if they break ‘the Sun and the Moon’ curse, they won’t have to turn. That process involves killing you, remember?”“Alex, I didn’t think—”“No, you don’t. I came back to keep you safe.” Alex stepped close to Elena. She grasped her shoulders. “How am I meant to help you if you don’t tell me what is going on?”Elena’s head dropped; she nodded and said, “I’m sorry.”“No more secrets, we agreed.”“Right. No secrets.” Elena adjusted the strap of her bag. “Does that mean I should tell you that I want to take Elijah’s deal?”“Yes.” Alex nodded. “And you are aware that his deal mentioned nothing about keeping you alive?”“You caught that did you?”Alex moved back to her car door, intending to get in. “From what I’ve seen, Elijah picks his words carefully. But I have already renegotiated our deal.”“You have?” Elena looked surprised.Alex smiled and nodded. “Elijah and I will work together to kill Klaus; you will go about your life as normal.”“What about everyone else?”“Your compassion for others, while a gift, is rather a nuisance.”“Alex!”Alex smirked and pulled out her car door. “Your friends are safe, as long as Damon can manage not to piss Elijah off.”“I can’t control what Damon does,” said Elena.“I think you would be surprised by what you could make Damon do.” Alex laid her arm across the top of the car door.Elena scrunched up her brow. “What’s that supposed to mean?”“I know that you love Stefan, but you have an incredibly strong hold over Damon. I’ve barely seen you two together, and it’s very clear that what you think of him is important,” explained Alex.Elena didn’t have a reply, but she seemed to contemplate Alex’s words.“I will see you at home; try to stay out of trouble.” Alex climbed into her car and waved as Elena turned and headed back towards the school.The whole situation wasn’t turning out how Alex had originally hoped. She knew that not every plan would go exactly as imagined, but she had hoped to have more results by now. Even though her time in Mystic Falls had been short, all she had accomplished so far was killing a single vampire. Alex had hoped to rid every vampire from Elena’s life, but with every minute that went by, Alex was starting to believe that she wouldn’t be able to do that.And everything with Elijah was startling as well, not just because of how she was reacting to him—physically and emotionally—but the revelation of her family history. Alex couldn’t help but wonder if it was a game, was Elijah trying to get into her head and fill it with lies? And if it was all true, why had no one at the Council ever told her about her family? Why keep her lineage a secret?The tingle across the back of her neck and the two knocks on her window pulled Alex from her pondering. Standing beside her car was a middle-aged man with dark skin—a witch. One she didn’t know. She frowned as he stepped back from her car, his hands buried into his jacket pockets.Rolling down her window, Alex asked, “Can I help you?”“I have a message for you from Elijah,” he said. He pulled a letter from his pocket and wiggled it in the air.Alex opened her car door and climbed out, reaching to take the letter as she did. “And why would a witch be delivering messages for Elijah? Did he drop his phone in the pond?”The man’s expression stayed neutral. “I wanted to meet you.”Alex glanced at her name elegantly written across the envelope.“Elijah mentioned that I may find myself working with a Bennett witch, but he never said anything about a Ravenwood witch.”Alex snapped her head up. “You’ve heard of my family?”He smirked. “Most witches—that read anything worthwhile—have heard of the Ravenwood bloodline.”A series of questions flooded Alex’s mind. She wanted to push this man and find out what books she should read so she could learn about her family.“Elijah mentioned that you had little knowledge about your bloodline; I’d be happy to share what I know.” He held out his hand. “My name is Dr Jonas Martin.”Alex took his hand, feeling their magic touch. “Alex Gilbert.”“I’m sure we will see each other again soon, Miss Gilbert.”Jonas Martin returned and walked away. He didn’t glance back, just kept walking until he disappeared down the street. He left Alex standing beside her car, holding the letter from Elijah. It had been a strange meeting, but once again, she had so many questions.Getting back into her car, Alex opened the letter and found a simple card inside. It said: Alexandra, meet me tonight at 106 Albert Ave, apartment 25. Elijah. There was no time or indication as to why, but Alex knew that she would be going. It seemed that Elijah and his witch, Jonas, knew more about her family than anyone else, and she wanted—no! She needed to find out what. *** The rest of Alex’s day was ordinary. She returned to the Gilbert house, where she enjoyed lunch with Jenna before going to James’ hotel. She talked about strategy and plans with her fellow witches before calling Renee with an update. Alex was surprised by how relaxed and unrushed the Council were. Normally, they pushed for results—a fast job is a good job. But Renee seemed pleased with where they were at. Their pleased and relaxed state sent nerves straight through Alex; there was something else at play.As she left James’ hotel, she made her way home to have dinner with her family. They ordered pizza and sat around the table talking when Alex’s phone rang. It was James. Excusing herself from her family, she stepped out onto the front porch to answer.“Hey, everything alright?” she answered.James’ sighed. “Robert picked up a vampire.”“Where?”Alex’s mind flashed to Klaus; if he was here, it meant he was ready for it to happen. However, the full moon was still three weeks away, and he was missing the moonstone. At the moment, no one knew she had it, and she could hopefully keep it that way.James said, “It seems to be hovering on the outskirts of town, around a foreclosure.”“Come pick me up; we can go and have a look.”“And what are you going to tell your family?” he asked.Alex frowned. They would have to meet James sooner or later. “How would you like to meet my family?” Butterflies danced in her stomach.“You sure about that?” he asked.“Why? You scared?” she challenged.James laughed. “No. But you were always set with keeping our life separate from them.”“I know.” Alex sat down on the porch steps and sighed. “But I don’t think Elena will ever get the truly normal life I wanted her to have. Not after all this.”“Alright. I’ll be there soon.”Alex decided it would probably be best to explain her story before James showed up; that way, she could leave with him without leaving them completely in the dark.Back inside, Jenna had cleared away the pizza boxes and had served up ice cream.Elena pulled the spoon she had in her mouth out, sucking off the last traces of ice cream before she asked, “Who called?”Alex hadn’t said much about James, they knew she was with someone, but that was all. “James,” she said.Both Elena and Jenna perked up. Jeremy rolled his eyes.Jenna asked, “The boyfriend?”Alex nodded. “Yes.”“Do we ever get to meet him?” asked Elena.“Yes, in about twenty minutes.”All three paused and stared at her, taking in her words.“Really?” Elena dropped her spoon.“Did you know he was coming?” asked Jenna.Alex sat down back in her seat. “He got here a few days ago, and I wasn’t sure how to introduce you all, but now he wants to take me out, so he’s coming to pick me up, and I figured we could just get it over with.”Elena’s face seemed to brighten. “I can’t wait to meet him; if he warmed your heart, he must be special.”Alex scoffed and swatted her arm.“Seriously, though,” said Jenna, “it will be good to see the man that always leaves a smile on your face.”Warmths swelled in Alex’s chest, to hear that they were excited to meet James felt good. There was a long period that she didn’t think they would ever meet, but while it was terrifying for James to enter her childhood home and meet her family, it was exciting. It was also one less thing that she was keeping from them all.James arrived just as they finished cleaning up. Jeremy had situated himself on the couch, his focus solely on the movie that was playing. Elena was sitting at the table with her homework spread out while chatting with Jenna and Alex.The polite knock made Alex stop talking and move towards the door. She knew that her family all turned and followed her with their eyes as she did. Pulling it open, Alex frowned when she found James standing next to Stefan. Both looked a little uncomfortable as they stood there, both of them with tense smiles.“Stefan?” said Alex, turning to Elena, who jumped up from the table.“Hey,” said Elena, “I didn’t know you were coming.” She took Stefan’s hand and pulled him across the threshold and to the side.“Yeah, I know. But I wanted to talk,” explained Stefan, wrapping his arms around Elena and pressing a kiss to her head. “And when I arrived, I bumped into….”James stepped across the threshold, surprising everyone but Alex—who had given him access to the house as soon as she’d returned—and took Alex’s hand. “James Hudson, Alex’s boyfriend.”Alex sighed. “Right, James, this is my sister, Elena. Her boyfriend, Stefan. My aunt, Jenna and my brother, Jeremy.”Elena smiled widely. “It’s so great to meet you. Alex hasn’t given us many details to go on.”James smiled widely, his warmth calming Alex’s nerves. “It’s great to finally put a face to a name. Alex has told me everything about all of you.”Jeremy snorted from his spot on the couch.Alex frowned at her brother; he had turned back to his movie as soon as James had started talking and didn’t look to be interested in saying hello to James at all. Jenna quickly moved over and hugged him before gushing about how happy she was for them. At the same time, excusing herself to go back to the kitchen. Leaving Alex to notice the frown Stefan was directed at James.“Something the matter, Stefan?” Alex prodded.Stefan’s frown cracked, and he shook his head, displaying a neutral look in its place. “No, not at all.”James squeezed her hand. “We should get going.”Alex nodded. “Right.”“You two have fun,” said Elena, “and James, we will see you soon.”James nodded. “Of course. Night all.”It was awkward, uncomfortable and suspicious all at the same time. As she walked with James to his car, Alex couldn’t help but wonder what Stefan wanted to talk to Elena about. The two of them hadn’t spoken really since Katherine’s death, and it seemed that the death of the vampire doppelganger had affected him more than he had realised. Or there was also the consideration that Stefan and Damon were making plans against her. Damon hated Alex as much as she hated him, and with his irrational mind, Alex knew there was a strong possibility that she would be on his hit list. The only thing keeping her alive would be the fact that if Damon did do something to her, Elena would have nothing to do with him ever again. But that didn’t stop Alex from suspecting them.
  
    Chapter Text
    Alex and James drove in silence. The soft murmur of the radio filled the air, and Alex felt herself relax into the passenger seat. The familiarity of travelling alongside James to go and hunt down a vampire felt good—it was like they were back to what was normal. There was no family drama, no unknown future; it was just them and the upcoming hunt.Robert had confirmed that the vampire seemed to be located at a foreclosure on the nicer—more expensive—side of Mystic Falls. They drove past the main square and continued to watch as the houses grey further apart and larger.James only spoke as he pulled the car over to the side of the road and pointed to their destination. He said, “This is the address that Sarah sent through.”Alex unclipped her seatbelt and said, “Nice house.”“I’m sure the people that used to live here thought so too.” James leant over and opened the glovebox of his car. He pulled out two carved stakes and handed one to Alex.Alex took the stake and couldn’t stop her smile. It felt good to be back at it.“What’s with that look?” James asked. His hand reaching out to touch her chin.Alex sighed happily. “This feels good, feels normal.”James chuckled. “That it does.”Climbing out of the car, they made their way across the road and up the front steps. Alex frowned when she felt nothing. Normally, the closer she got to any supernatural, she would feel them; but there was nothing as she twisted the door handle and stepped inside the dark home.“The vampire isn’t here,” said Alex.James’ tense shoulders relaxed as he stepped past her. “Maybe we can still find something to help work out who it is.”He headed towards the stairs, and Alex moved towards the living space.The home was beautifully decorated, with expensive furnishings. There were pieces of furniture covered with white cloths; others had been pulled off and dropped onto a chair in the far corner. It seemed that someone had definitely been inside, moving the cloth to sit down on the couch.As Alex moved towards the dining room, her phone rang. Pulling it out, she frowned when she saw Bonnie’s name flashing. She hadn’t spoken much to the young witch, but she knew that Bonnie was one of Elena’s closest friends. And after their conversation in her car after the Founder’s event, Alex knew she could trust Bonnie.“Hello, Bonnie,” answered Alex.“Hey, Alex. How’s things?” asked Bonnie. Her voice strained as she spoke.Alex frowned. “Fine. What can I do for you?”Bonnie let out a huff and said, “I was-um hoping that you could-arh give me some advice.”“Sure; any witchey questions you got, ask away.”There was a pause of silence before Bonnie said, “Well, it’s not really a witch question. It’s a-um—I don’t know what to say.”Alex looked around the dining room, spotting two chairs with the white sheets removed and placed on the floor. She said, “Bonnie, just tell me whatever is going on.”Bonnie groaned. “Fine—I-kissed-Jeremy.”“I’m sorry?” Alex paused in the kitchen archway. Jeremy had mentioned the increased amount of time the two of them had spent together, but Alex hadn’t realised that Bonnie would reflect Jeremy’s feelings.Bonnie let out a small whine and said, “I kissed Jeremy.”“Seriously?”“Yeah. And now I’m freaking out because he is yours and Elena’s little brother, and up until recently, that was all he was, but now I’ve seen something so different. He’s so kind and helpful and determined and funny, and I can’t stop thinking about him. And the kiss! Oh my God, the kiss was just—”“Bonnie, breathe!” Alex pulled open the fridge and took in the sound of the soft hum as the cold air touched her skin and the blood bags that sat stacked on one of the shelves.“Right, sorry.”Alex asked, “Is this why Jeremy’s been in a weird mood?”Bonnie said, “Maybe, I don’t really know. All I know is the other night we were at the Grille, and we were laughing, and then we were kissing.”“What happened after the kiss?”“I made up some stupid excuse and ran.”“Oh.” Alex couldn’t say she was that surprised.“Yeah—he probably thinks I hate him.”Alex shook her head and made her way back towards the entrance hall of the home. She said, “No, I think he is probably a little freaked just like you. Most guys don’t like it when the girl they kiss runs off.”“I don’t even know why I left.”“Have you spoken to Jeremy since?”“No. I don’t know what to say. And what do I tell Elena?”“Elena will be happy for both of you—if you both want to be together. Sure, it will probably be strange for a little while, but in the long run, she’d want you both to be happy.”“Really?”Alex smiled as she heard Bonnie’s hopeful tone. She said, “Really, really. Now, stop talking to me and call Jeremy. It would be nice to see my brother happy for a change.”“Thanks, Alex.”“You are welcome.”James came back down the stairs as Alex hung open and slipped her phone away. He said, “There are suitcases in the master bedroom; from the looks of the clothing, it’s a female.”Alex nodded. “There’s blood bags in the fridge.”“So a vampire is crashing here; it’s just not currently here.”“Appears so.”“Do you want to wait for it to come back?” asked James.Alex frowned. It was odd that a random vampire would come into town and pick out a place like this if they were passing through. Mystic Falls wasn’t ideal for vampires as deaths were easily noticeable. Bigger cities made it easy to cover their tracks.“Not tonight.”They moved towards the front door.“Who was on the phone?” asked James.Alex said, “Bonnie. Boy trouble.”James laughed. “I never imagined you being the one to give advice.”Alex smirked and shrugged. “I’m full of surprises.”Turning towards the door, James said, “Shall I drop you home? Or maybe you’d like to stay with me tonight.” He reached for her hand and tangled their fingers together. The small quirk of the corner of his mouth told Alex exactly what he was thinking.“Get your head out of the gutter,” she teased.James shrugged.“But I do have another stop to make.”James paused. “Where?”“Elijah asked me to meet him tonight.”James opened the door for Alex. “What about?”“I’m hoping that it is about his plan for Klaus,” said Alex.They walked back towards the car, both of them watching to see if they noticed anything strange.“I also met his witch today,” she added.James paused at the driver’s side door. “Why didn’t you say anything sooner?”Alex frowned. “I didn’t really think about it.” She opened the door and climbed in.“You didn’t think about it? Seriously? Another witch is involved, and that just slipped your mind?”Alex couldn’t help but feel foolish. James was right; how had that slipped her mind. She wondered why hadn’t she called James the second that Jonas had walked away? Another witch made things complicated, especially since they had no idea how strong Jonas was.“You’re right,” said Alex, “I’m sorry.”James took her hand and squeezed it. “I’m not mad, just confused. You’ve been a little strange since Elijah showed up.”Alex tried to swallow the lump in her throat. She wasn’t going to tell anyone—James most of all—about how she was reacting to Elijah. It freaked her out enough, but what would James think?“I’m worried about you,” said James.Alex squeezed his hand. “I’m just stressed.”They locked eyes, and Alex could see the doubt in James’ eyes, but he didn’t question her further. He just nodded and lifted their locked hands up to his mouth. He pressed a kiss to the back of her hand.He said, “Okay. Now, where are you meeting Elijah?” *** The address that Elijah had provided was for an apartment building not far from the town square in Mystic Falls. James parked the car down a side street and followed Alex up to the third floor. They found apartment 25, and Alex felt it. The increasingly familiar tingle that Elijah’s presence caused, along with the spark of unfamiliar magic. Jonas was definitely inside, but so was another witch.“You alright?” asked James, his hand on her shoulder.Alex nodded and then knocked on the door.Jonas was the one to open the door. He locked eyes with Alex; the same blank expression that covered his face from earlier was still displayed. But a flash of surprise appeared when he took in James standing just behind her.“The invitation wasn’t inclusive of friends,” said Jonas.Alex shrugged. “It also didn’t say I couldn’t bring a friend.”“Dr Martin, Alexandra is more than welcome to bring anyone she wishes.” From behind Jonas stood Elijah. Dressed impeccably and hold a crystal glass in one hand.Jonas stepped back and allowed Alex and James to enter. The apartment wasn’t overly large, but it was filled with books. Alex found herself drawn to a large shelf on one wall that was overstacked with old books. She could feel the magic wound into them.“Grimoires,” said another voice.Alex turned to another witch, younger than all of them.“My son, Luka,” said Jonas.Luka walked over to Alex and held out his hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”Alex smiled warmly and shook his hand.“Why have you invited us here?” asked James. He was still standing by the door, his eyes locked on Elijah.Elijah looked at him and said, “I didn’t invite you here.” He took a sip of his drink. “I invited Alexandra to discuss what is to come.”“Your plan for Klaus, I hope,” said Alex.Elijah nodded.“Killing an Original isn’t going to be easy,” said James.“No, it won’t be,” said Elijah.“Is that why you have your friends?” asked Alex.Elijah nodded. “Dr Martin and his son are here to assist.”“Willingly?” asked James.Alex turned to frown at James.“Our reasoning for being here is our own,” said Jonas.James said, “Why so secretive?”Jonas’ neutral expression turned dark. He crossed his arms over his chest.“Dad, why don’t we just tell them?” asked Luka.“We don’t have to explain ourselves,” said Jonas. “Judgemental witches like him are the reason so many of our kind are shunned.”Alex sighed and rubbed the back of her neck.“Witches like me,” said James, stepping towards Jonas, “do what needs to be done.”“Enough,” said Alex. “James, maybe you should wait in the car.”James’ shock wasn’t surprising to her. They always stood side by side; their opinions on vampires and witches that turned their back on their own kind had always been aligned. Working with vampires was something neither of them wanted, but at that moment, they couldn’t judge Jonas and his son when they were in the same situation.“Seriously?” James asked.Alex nodded. “That, or stop talking.”Elijah walked across the room, grabbing Alex’s attention as he took a seat on a chair in the corner of the living space. “Why don’t we just get down to business?”Alex stepped away from the bookshelf. “What is your plan?”“What do you know about an Original’s weakness?” he asked.“You can be killed, but only by a special stake made from the wood of a White Oaktree. None of which have existed in a thousand years,” said Alex.Elijah nodded. “Without a White Oak stake, the only way I believe we could kill my brother is to weaken him to the point that I would be able to crush his head.”“That would require channelling a lot of power,” said James.“And the full moon wouldn’t require enough of a boost, even if all of us did it together,” said Alex.Jonas picked up a book from the table and opened it before holding it out to Alex. She took in from him and looked down at the page. A witch massacre in Mystic Falls.“After the Salem witch trials, migrating settlers found their way to what would become known as Mystic Falls. In 1790 a neighbouring settlement experienced a wave of anti-witch hysteria. The town decided to round a vast group of men and women, all suspected of practising witchcraft. They were tried as witches. Tied to stakes and burnt,” explained Jonas.Alex ran her hand over the story of the witches.“How many of them were actually witches?” asked James.“A large number,” said Elijah.“That type of death would leave a mark,” said Alex.Jonas nodded. “Their violent deaths have marked the spot, and if they allowed us, the spirits that no doubt haunt that very location could give us the power boost we would need.”“Sounds like you don’t know where this location is,” said James.“We don’t,” said Luka.Jonas frowned at his son.“The location isn’t noted anywhere—not that we have been able to find,” said Elijah.“So, you want to find this location,” said Alex, “and have us channel the energy to weaken Klaus enough so that you can kill him?”Elijah nodded.“Why do I feel like you’ve left something out?” asked Alex. She snapped the book closed and placed it down on the table. Alex knew that Elijah had been careful to never promise that Elena would never have to go through the ritual. His first offer only mentioned keeping everyone she loved safe. He could have every intention to let Klaus kill Elena before striking making his attempt.Elijah stood. “We are still getting to know one another,” he said. “It would be unwise for me to show all my cards right away.”James scoffed. “You vampires are all the same.”Alex froze as Elijah flashed across the room, grasped James by the throat, and pressed him against the wall. James gasped for breath as his hands grasped at Elijah’s arm, his magic flaring in defence. Alex noted the pain expression on Elijah’s face; they were both hurting the other equally.“Enough,” snapped Alex. It surprised her a little when they both released one another, and Elijah stepped back.“You bastard,” groaned James.“James!” Alex walked over to him and stepped in between him and Elijah. “None of us like this situation, but I need you to work with me to keep Elena safe.”James’ eyes flashed over her shoulder to glare at Elijah before looking back at her. His expression softened, and he nodded. “Fine.”“And you.” Alex turned to Elijah. “If you want our help and cooperation—because I have no problem with killing you as well as your brother—all cards will be out on the table.”Elijah straightened his jacket. His expression looking the most frustrated she had ever seen it. “Fine.”It was never a place that Alex could ever imagine herself. She was normally the confrontational one that James would have to centre. She was the one that lashed out and didn’t think before she acted. But this time around, she knew everything was different. James felt uncomfortable working with vampires, as did Alex, but it was her family on the line this time. Elena had done nothing to be dragged into the supernatural world; she was unfortunately born a doppelganger.The rules were different this time, but Alex didn’t have the time to come to terms with change. Klaus could show up at any point, and she was now forced to rely on two vampires to help her stop him. Alex could hope that Mikael would show up—stake in hand—and finally kill Klaus, or she could hope that Elijah’s plan would work—but would he really be able to kill his brother? Alex knew she would need a plan of her own, a plan that would make sure if both failed that Elena wouldn’t end up Klaus’ sacrifice.James walked out of the apartment first. Alex turned to follow and jumped slightly when Elijah grasped her hand to stop her. She looked back at the Original confused, not only by his actions but startled by the way her heart was pounding in her chest.Elijah said, “I hope that our partnership will lead to what we both want.”Alex nodded. “As do I.”He dropped his head, looking at the hand he held. He released her and said, “Good night, Alexandra.”Alex hoped that her cheeks didn’t turn red because she felt the rest of her body flush at the sound of her full name from his lips. It was oddly enjoyable to hear, but that wasn’t something she wanted to think about—at all. Alex cleared her throat and turned to leave, needing distance and fresh air.As she stepped out on the street, she spotted James waiting for her. He looked tense but also apologetic.“I’m sorry,” he said.Alex nodded. “I know.”“I don’t know what came over me. But I don’t trust Elijah—or his witches.”Alex didn’t know what to say. Elijah had been more than forthcoming about everything, more than anyone else knew. There was also the strange way her magic and body had been reacting to Elijah—and those were details she didn’t plan on sharing with anyone. Alex could only imagine what James would think if she mentioned that her heart pounded in her chest or that the way her magic tingled when he was close. It horrified her to think what Renee would say if she knew. And while Jonas was strange, she knew that something was driving him to help Elijah. It wasn’t loyalty that she knew. But whatever it was, it was possible he was more dangerous than Elijah.“At the moment, I don’t know what to think,” said Alex. “But for now, let’s work with them. If this plan can stop Klaus, then I’m all for it.”James nodded. “I’ll do some research to see if I can find the spot where all those witches died.”Alex nodded.“Let’s get you home.” James laid his arm across her shoulders, and they walked back to his car.All Alex wanted was for it all to be over. For Klaus to be dead and for Elena to be safe. Then Alex could go back to what she knew was right and not have to worry about all the other crap.James dropped Alex off with a kiss that made Alex realise how strange things were becoming. It wasn’t like any other kiss they had ever shared. Alex tried to shake it off as she walked up to the front porch.She was pulled from her confusion, though, when she found a package sitting by the door with a letter address to her. The handwriting was Elijah. She opened the letter and was surprised at his words. Alexandra, I think this belongs to you. Elijah.Tearing open the brown paper, Alex’s surprise only increased. An old book was inside, and as her hands touched its pages, she felt the spark. It was a grimoire. Flipping open to the first page, Alex smiled widely as she read the names inscribed on the inside.
  Georgiana Ravenwood.

  Melody Ravenwood.

  Elizabeth Ravenwood.

  Ginnaveve Ravenwood.

  Nadia Ravenwood.
It was a list of Ravenwood witches, her family. Elijah had gifted Alex her families grimoire.“Hello, Alexandra.”Closing the grimoire, Alex turned to see the one man she could do without. She glared at the man standing at the foot of the porch. “What do you want, John?”
  
    Chapter Text
    John Gilbert was the Uncle that nobody got along with. Alex couldn’t recall any fond memories of him from her childhood and hadn’t seen him since her parents funeral. He had hardly spoken to them, only appearing a few days before the funeral and then leaving after it was over. What Alex could remember about him was that he always caused tension with Grayson and Miranda. Alex remembered arguments and yelling. All of which would cease the moment any of the kids showed up. But John was never around much anyway.And now, here he was. Standing before her, a pleased look on his face. She had no idea what he wanted or why he was here, but she had no intention of letting him inside.“It’s been a while,” said John.“Not long enough.”“When did you get back into town?”“Why does that matter to you?”“Just curious.”“Why are you here?”“I have my reasons—is Elena home?”“Yes.”“Wonderful.” John stepped up the porch to walk past Alex and inside.It gave Alex great satisfaction when he opened the door but was unable to cross the threshold.“What the?”Alex smirked and stepped around John as he took a step back. She stepped across the threshold and into the house.“How?”“There is so much that you don’t know, John.” Alex tilted her head to the side and smiled.“Alex, what’s going on?” Elena’s voice floated from downstairs.“We have an unwanted visitor,” said Alex.Elena came down the stairs, dressed in her pyjamas; she frowned when she spotted John. “Why are you here?”John sighed. “Is it wrong for a father to want to spend time with his daughter?”Alex’s stomach twisted. “Excuse you?”Elena sighed.“I’m Elena’s biological father,” said John. His own satisfied smirk appearing.“Seriously?”Elena nodded. “Unfortunately. But nothing has changed, John; no one wants you here.”John pressed his hand against the barrier. “Evidently. Is this barrier your friends doing?”Alex said, “No. It was my doing. Had to keep the riff-raff out.”“You’re a witch?”“That I am. So, if you will excuse us, we have better things to do than talk to you.” Alex grabbed the door and swung it closed in John’s face, letting out a sigh as she did.Elena scratched the back of her head and turned towards the kitchen.Alex followed after her and asked, “How come you never mentioned that John was your father?”Elena cringed. “Because I don’t consider him my father. I don’t even consider him family.”“How’d you find out?”“It just kind of spilt out, and when I asked him, he didn’t deny it.” Elena grabbed the kettle and filled it with water. “And I have tried to forget about it ever since.”Alex leant against the counter and placed her families grimoire in front of her.“What’s that?” asked Elena.Alex ran her hand over the cover. “My families grimoire.”“It looks really old.”“It is.” Alex flipped open the front page. “It’s been through at least four generations of my family.”“Wow.”“Yeah.”They fell silent for a moment as Alex looked down at the names before starting to flip through the pages.“What did you and James get up to tonight?” asked Elena.Alex considered making up a story, but without much consideration about what Elena might think, she told her the truth. “James has been keeping an eye on any supernatural activity in Mystic Falls.”Elena turned around and frowned.“He’s been in town for a few days, staying at a ‘bed and breakfast’.”“Why didn’t you tell me?” asked Elena. She grabbed two cups from the cupboard and placed them on the island between them.“I’m used to keeping things to myself, and I guess I wasn’t ready to share that part of my life with you all.” It wasn’t a lie; Alex didn’t want to share her whole vampire-hunting side. She found it awkward enough that Elena knew how much she hated and despised Stefan and Damon; what would she say if she knew that Alex hunted down vampires for a living.“Right.” Elena put two tea bags into the cups and looked back at the kettle as it boiled.“James found a vampire in town—a vampire we are unaware of.”Elena nodded.“We went to check out its last location, which was a foreclosure on the other side of town.”“And?”“There is definitely a vampire staying there, most likely a female. But they weren’t there.”Elena turned back around. Questions gleaming in her face.“What is it?” asked Alex.“Maybe Elijah has a friend in town?”Alex shook her head. “I spoke with Elijah; the only friends he has in town are two witches, a father and son.”Elena frowned. “Bonnie mentioned that she bumped into a witch a school—Luka.”Alex nodded. “That’s him.”“They are working with Elijah?”“It seems so. What I don’t know is why.”“What do you mean, why?” asked Elena.“Witches don’t normally just get along with vampires. There is a lot of bad history between the factions for that. Normally, cooperation is linked to a united goal—like us all wanting Klaus dead—or perhaps a favour owed.”Elena picked up the kettle once it had finished boiling and finished off the tea. “You think Elijah did something for them, and now they have to return the favour?”Alex nodded. “Exactly.”Sliding a cup across to Alex, Elena placed the kettle back down on the stove. “Damon doesn’t think we should trust Elijah.”Alex sighed and closed the grimoire. “Normally, I wouldn’t either.”“He has been looking for a way to kill him.”“He won’t find anything.” Alex took a sip of her tea.“You sound certain of that.” Elena picked up her own tea.“Do you think you could talk to him?”Alex almost spat out her tea. “What?”“I know you don’t get along—”“That’s putting it mildly.”“—but he is going to get himself killed. And I don’t want to be responsible for his death.” Elena looked torn.Alex walked around the kitchen island and said, “Damon is not your responsibility. Unless you are standing there cheering him on to try and kill Elijah. That vampire is self-destructive and won’t listen to anyone, so I wouldn’t waste your time with him.”Elena frowned. “You think that about any vampire.”“True.” She wasn’t wrong; Alex could rebut her on that. “But Damon’s only motivation for any of this is to win you over.”“What?” Elena looked up, confused.“You don’t see it?”“See what?”“Damon likes you—more than he should.”“You think he’s trying to win my affection?” asked Elena.Alex nodded. “Why else would he be so desperate to act against Elijah when Elijah has done nothing other than to offer to help us?”Elena seemed to stand there, slightly stunned.Alex patted her sister’s shoulder sympathetically. “I think if anyone needs to talk to him, it’s you.”Elena shoulder’s sagged.“How about we just leave him to his own devices? That way, we can focus on keeping you alive and killing Klaus?” Alex smiled softly at Elena before leaving the kitchen; she was tired but also wanted a shower. “I’m going to bed; I will see you in the morning.”Elena nodded. “Night.”As Alex climbed the stairs, she couldn’t help but wonder if there was anything for Damon to find. She knew that if Damon thought for even a second, he would kill an Original—he would. But she also knew that Damon would do anything he thought was right. What worried Alex is that he would ruin the whole plan and get Elena killed in the process. *** The next morning, Alex enjoyed how normal their family was. She made breakfast, Jenna put the coffee on, and the four of them sat around the dining table and talked about normal things. Alex noticed that Jeremy seemed happier; the teenager angst he’d been holding onto recently seemed to have faded. Alex wondered if Bonnie had called him. Elena talked about a school dance that Caroline had recruited her for, and Jenna mentioned that she had a date with Alaric.Jenna and Alex cleaned up from breakfast, and then Alex left the house with her siblings. Alex dropped Elena and Jeremy at school before making her way towards the police station. After joining the Council, she hadn’t heard much from them. She intended to chat with the Sherrif and maybe find out if there was anything she hadn’t heard about yet. If any missing people had been reported last night or bodies found. There was a strange vampire in town, and she would like to find out who it was.As she was walking towards the police station, she noticed Alaric standing on the edge of the footpath. He seemed to be staring, but at what she didn’t know. Alex approached him and offered a smile.She said, “Good morning.”Alaric turned to look at her, and he smiled. It was a different smile from the previous ones she had seen. It looked almost misplaced on his features. “Alexandra, good morning.”Alex cringed at her full name. “Don’t you have a class to teach?”He nodded. “That I do. I got caught up in a few errands this morning.”“Right.”Alaric’s body shifted, and he stepped a little too close to her. He asked, “How is Elena?”“She’s as good as one can be.”He nodded. “Of course. This Klaus person could be anyone. That would be rather—ominous.”Alex wasn’t sure what to say. Alaric seemed strange, but then, she hadn’t known the teacher long. Maybe he was just a strange man. “Yeah. I better go.”He smiled. “Yes, as had I. Have a good day, love.”Alex frowned at Alaric, turned and walked away. She had never felt so awkward around him before.Once Alaric had disappeared, Alex made her way up the steps of the station. She found herself greeted by a Deputy who walked her through to Elizabeth Forbes office. The Sherrif stood up as Alex stepped inside.She said, “Alex, good morning.”“Morning, Sherrif. How are you?” Alex asked.“Oh, please, Alex. Call me Liz.” Liz gestured for her to sit. “I am well, and yourself?”Alex nodded. “I am good. I was hoping to ask about our recent animal attacks.”Liz’s face turned serious, and she nodded. She stood up and closed her door before walking back around her desk. “Of course, as a part of the Council now, you can ask me anything?”Alex hadn’t really considered what to ask exactly, but she knew that Liz would—or at least she hoped she would—tell her if they were suspicious of anything. “I came back to Mystic Falls because I heard about the recent string of deaths.”Liz nodded. “All of which were handle and vampires dealt with.”“Yes, so Damon told me. However, how can you be so sure that you got them all?” asked Alex.Liz’s frown told Alex everything. They weren’t certain.“How do you know if a vampire is around?” asked Alex.“Vampires hunt regularly. When one is active in town, it doesn’t take long before people go missing or bodies show up.” Liz sat back down.“Right.”Liz leant forward. “Why are you so worried? Everything has been great recently.”Alex almost laughed. If only they really knew what was going on. “I suppose I find it difficult sometimes, knowing that there are monsters out there. They could be anyone.”Liz nodded, her face sympathetic. “It is a lot. Which is why I am surprised that your parents told you when you were so young.”Alex sighed. “They believed I was ready.”A hard knock on the door made them pause.“Come in,” said Liz.The door opened, and John stepped inside. “Morning,” he said, smiling. “Hope I’m not interrupting.”“You were,” snapped Alex.“My apologies. Liz, how are you?” asked John.“Fine, John. When did you get back?” asked Liz.“Last night.”Liz sighed. “Was there something you want?”“Yes, to speak with my niece. Alaric told me he saw you headed this way.”Alex stood from her seat. “Liz, thank you.”Liz nodded. “Anything you need.”Alex offered her a smile before turning to leave. She knocked her shoulder against John’s as she walked out. There was no intention to stop; she just headed back to her car. Alex had been hoping to get Liz looking for vampires, a nudge to perhaps knock her onto the strange vampire running around—or maybe even the Salvatores. Either would please her.John followed Alex outside. “We need to talk, Alexandra.”Alex didn’t stop walking. “Use my full name again, and I will remove your tongue.”“Wow, so violent.”“Oh, you haven’t seen how violent I can get.” Alex reached the car and unlocked it.John blocked her door and frowned. “I am here to keep Elena safe.”“I don’t believe you.”“You know that she is my daughter. All I want is for her to be safe and to live a vampire-free life.”Alex hated that their interests were aligned, but she trusted John less than Damon.“I have a way to keep Elena safe.”“How?” she asked, more out of curiosity of what bullshit he would pull out of his ass.Alex stomach twisted as she felt a third party join them—a vampire.“We have a plan.”Alex turned to look at the vampire. A female vampire with long black hair stood with her hands in her pockets and a soft smirk on her face.“Alex, this is Elena’s biological mother—Isobel,” said John.“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Alex.” Isobel held out her hand.Alex ignored it. “Elena’s life is better and safer without the both of you in it. Now get out of Mystic Falls before I make you regret your decision to show up.” She grabbed John’s arm that was holding her car door shut and twisted his wrist, cracking his wrist and causing him to cry out and stepped back.“You will regret not listening to me,” said Isobel.Alex scoffed. “I highly doubt that.”Getting into her car, she drove away as quickly as she could. Everything inside Alex told her to go back and kill Isobel, rid the world of Elena’s vampire mother. The vampire mother that Elena hadn’t mentioned. *** The afternoon sun was nice as Alex sat in the backyard on the grass. She had escaped the strange occurrences of the morning and decided to spend the rest of her day immersed in her families history. The grimoire that Elijah had gifted her was beautiful and amazing. Not only were there pages of spells and elixirs she had never heard of, but there were entries about her family—there were even notes on the creation of the Council. It was astounding to read how her family had viewed the world and the ‘vampire problem’ as many of them labelled it.It was Alex’s perfect distraction; she didn’t want to have to think about the fact that Elena’s biological mother was a vampire, that John was trying to medal, that she was having strange reactions to an Original vampire and that the whole situation was just a confusing bundle of questions.The last time Alex had been certain was when she had woken Mikael. It was a good plan, but even the Original hunter had disappeared. There had been no sign from him since he left them in Charlotte. Klaus might have been nowhere near Mystic Falls, and Mikael was on track with killing him, or maybe Mikael had simply used Alex to get out of his entombment. Either way, Alex wanted a few hours to enjoy the grimoire in her lap.Alex’s phone buzzed with a message from James, telling her that they were tracking Isobel and that she had returned to her foreclosure. Robert had confirmed that Isobel was the only other vampire in town and that she had been the one they had picked up. For now, Alex was hopeful that Isobel would leave, but she knew it was naive to think that they would simply go.Her phone buzzed again, another message from James. And then it rang; an unknown number.Alex normally ignored unknown numbers; anyone worth talking to was programmed into her phone. But she decided to answer.“Hello?”A deep voice sighed. “It amazes me how far humans have progressed. These telephones are wonderful devices.”“Mikael?” she asked.“Who else?”“You’ve been quiet.”“Niklaus trail was tricky to pick up, but it seems that he still follows old habits.”“You found him.”“I believe so. It seems he is in Mystic Falls—or at least he’s heading there.”Alex’s stomach dropped. “He knows.”“Yes, it seems so.”
  
    Chapter Text
    There weren’t very many moments that Alex could remember where she had felt such panic. Mikael’s words had hit her so hard that she hadn’t been able to comprehend what was happening. But Klaus was in Mystic Falls, or at least on his way, and they still had no idea what to expect. He could have already been here for some time, under all of their noses. Alex liked to believe that he wouldn’t have been able to slip in so easily, but then again, Klaus had endless resources—and probably a few dozen witches on hand.When the words had sunk in, Alex had called James. They went to work in getting any possible advantage they could have ready. Then she called Elena and had her come home from school, same with Jeremy. From there, it wasn’t long before everyone had converged on the Gilbert household.Alex was standing in the kitchen, leaning against the counter, trying to think of what to do. Elena was sitting at the head of the table, with Stefan on one side, Jenna on the other. Jeremy hadn’t said a word, but Alex had noticed how his concern was flashing between both Elena and Bonnie. Bonnie had asked what they could do, as had Damon, who was standing out on the front porch. The only person who hadn’t show up was Alaric; it seemed he wasn’t answering his phone.“You don’t think Klaus has hurt Alaric?” asked Jenna.Damon scoffed from the front porch. “What for? To him, he is just another human, not a threat.”“I’m sure he’s fine,” said Stefan.“He’s probably just lost his phone again,” added Elena.“What’s the plan here?” asked Damon.“How do we act against someone that we don’t know?” asked Caroline.“What is Elijah doing? Shouldn’t he be here?” asked Damon. He leant his hands on either side of the doorframe. “Doesn’t he at least have a photo of his brother?”Alex sighed. “We don’t really have a lot of options.” Pushing away from the counter.“He might not even be here yet,” said Elena, “and I really don’t want to hide away in this house when I have this I would like to be doing.”“Exactly,” exclaimed Caroline, “we have a dance to set up.”Elena and Bonnie sighed.“A school dance is hardly important,” said Damon.“Shut up, Damon,” snapped Caroline.“He is right,” said Alex. The words tasted like ash in her mouth, but a school dance didn’t matter when Elena’s life was hanging in the balance.“We have time,” said Stefan, “the full moon is still a few weeks away.”“Klaus has no need of me until he has everything else,” said Elena.“Where even is the moonstone?” asked Damon.Alex was the only one in the room that knew. It was currently residing in her bedroom, sealed inside a small box.“Wasn’t it with Katherine in the tomb?” asked Bonnie.All eyes turned to Alex. “It’s safe.”“Safe is where exactly?” asked Stefan.“If I am the only one who knows where it is, the fewer people that can hand it over to Klaus.” Alex crossed her arms. “I have no intention of allowing him to get it.”The group fell silent. Alex turned to look at Elena, who was already looking at her.Elena said, “I think we all just need to keep acting like everything is normal. If we can make Klaus think that we don’t know about him, it could give us an advantage.”“That sounds like the smartest thing anyone has said since we got here,” grumbled Damon. “Elena, I think you should come and stay at the Boarding House. No one will think to look for you there.”Alex glared.“Why?” asked Stefan. “Alex has this house locked uptight. Klaus isn’t getting inside.”“If she is with us, we have a better chance of protecting her,” explained Damon.“If you come face to face with Klaus, Elena is more likely to disappear forever.” Alex walked back into the kitchen, ignoring Damon as he grumbled from his place at the door.“What is going on here? Damon, mate, why are you standing out here?” Alaric’s voice came from the front.“The barrier—remember?” said Damon.Alaric laughed. “Right, I forgot.”Alex couldn’t help but think the laugh wasn’t right.“Where have you been?” asked Jenna, “we have been calling you.”“I know, and I’m sorry. Some students just don’t stop talking.” Alaric sighed. “What did I miss?”“Sister witch taking control as usual,” said Damon.“It’s the best thing to do, Damon,” said Elena.“I need a drink.”Damon’s retreating steps made Alex want to sigh with relief.“Did you want to stay for dinner?” asked Jenna. She had stood up and walked towards the door.Alex couldn’t stop herself from peering out of the kitchen to see Jenna standing with Alaric at the doorframe. He could get in, but she noticed how his toes were right at the entrance like he wasn’t able to.“I think I should check on Damon, love.” Alaric smiled warmly at Jenna.Jenna cleared her throat. “Yeah, okay.”“I’ll call you later.”Alex leant against the wall and waited until Jenna closed the door before she spoke. “Is it just me, or has he been strange lately?”Jenna sighed. “I don’t know. It might have something to do with Isobel being here.”Alex frowned. She hadn’t mentioned Elena’s biological mother showing up. “What?”“Isobel.” Jenna turned and walked back towards them.“She showed up at school today,” said Elena, “claimed that she was here to keep me safe.”“And you didn’t call me why?” asked Alex.“You called not ten minutes later with the Klaus announcement; I hadn’t had the chance.”“Oh.” Alex moved over to the table to sit beside Elena. “What did she say?”“That she has been working with John to find a way to keep me safe. They have set up some safe house in my name.” Elena dropped her hands onto the table.Stefan reached out to take one of her hands. “Sounds like they want to help.”“Last time Isobel was here, she wanted nothing to do with me. In fact, she threatened to kill us all if we didn’t stop looking for her,” said Elena.Alex frowned. She didn’t like hearing that. “She hated the idea of being a mother that much.”“I’m pretty sure her emotions were switched off,” piped up Caroline.Alex wanted to laugh. The humanity switch that vampires went on about was nothing but an excuse to act like an animal.“Maybe the idea of losing you made her switch flip?” offered Bonnie.Elena sighed. “I don’t know and don’t really want to know. I would prefer if they would just leave.” She pushed herself up from her chair. “Excuse me.” Elena left the dining room and headed towards the stairs.Alex watched her go and wasn’t surprised when after barely a few moments, Stefan followed.Isobel and John have just added annoyances to the whole problem. Their interference could cause all sorts of issues; they might even be leading Klaus right to Elena. Whatever they were planning, Alex was going to make sure that they didn’t succeed. Killing Isobel hadn’t skipped Alex’s mind; she had been tempted upon their first meeting. But, the thought that she was Elena’s biological mother was lingering beside it. If she took that step and killed Isobel, Alex had no idea how Elena would feel. It wouldn’t be like killing Katherine; everyone shared a sense of relief knowing that the doppelganger bitch was gone; but Isobel was Elena’s family, whether anyone wanted to accept it or not.Caroline and Bonnie left not long after, Alex noticing the shared look between Jeremy and Bonnie. It left the house quiet as Jeremy retreated to his room, and Jenna started to try and make something for dinner. Alex was left to contemplate her next step.What she wanted to do was focus on Klaus. James was attempting to assist Elijah in the hunt for the location on which over a hundred witches were sacrificed. Mikael was tracking Klaus but hadn’t given Alex anything else. Leaving Alex to come up with a plan c. Mikael was defiantly planning A; he could surprise Klaus and stake him—a happy ending for all. But if Mikael and Elijah both failed, Alex was going to be ready for him.Alex decided she needed to explore other options for putting a vampire down. If she found something—like with the moonstone—she would make sure that no one else could ruin the plan. Collecting her own grimoire as well as her families grimoire, Alex left the house.She made her way back to the pond. The sun was hidden behind the clouds, and a small chill was in the air as she sat down at the base of the tree. Looking at both grimoires, Alex placed her own on the ground beside her. Crossing her legs, she placed the book on her thighs and closed her eyes.It was a small trick she had taught herself after growing bored with research. Some witches were content flipping through each page, but Alex had never enjoyed study. Any shortcut she could find she would use. Holding her hands up over the book, she let out a slow breath and focused.The pages of the grimoire flipped over like a strong gust of wind was blowing through them, and then they stopped.Alex’s eyes snapped open as she looked down at an entry. It wasn’t a spell but what looked like a diary entry of sorts.
  November 11, 1864

  The subject has been starved of blood for six months. Skin has lost all colour. Movement is minimal. Speech is still functioning. Possible applications – spell to desiccate vampires instantly?
Alex was surprised. Experimenting on vampires. It seemed that one of her ancestors were looking for weaknesses. The idea of desiccation was not something Alex ever considered using; why immobilise a vampire when you could just kill it. But Klaus wasn’t just any vampire; he was practically indestructible. If Alex could find a spell to desiccate him with, then she would have time to find a way to kill him.“If I had known that your grandmother’s grimoire was going to put such a look on your face, I would have gifted it to you sooner.”Alex looked up to see Elijah standing across from her. She hadn’t even realised that a smile had broken out on her face, and it worried her slightly that she hadn’t noticed his approach either.“I’m starting to think that you are following me,” said Alex.A smile graced Elijah’s lips. “Last time was a coincidence. I may have come looking for you this time.” He walked towards her.Alex closed the grimoire, wanting to make sure he didn’t peak at what she had found out, and placed it on top of her other grimoire.She asked, “You were looking for me?”Elijah nodded.“What for?”He took a seat on the root and leant his forearms on his knees. “I wanted to discuss my plan with you.”Alex frowned. “What details did you admit?”Elijah sighed. “I am not normally so forthcoming with information, yet for some reason, I feel compelled to share this with you. Not that my intention was nefarious towards your sister, but I felt that you would have refused to cooperate if you had known.”Alex sighed. She knew exactly what he meant. It had been a detail she had noted from his first offer with Elena. Not once did he mention her survival. Alex knew that Elijah’s plan meant using Elena as bait to force Klaus to step into the light. But what happened after that was really unknown—or at least it was.Klaus was an Original Vampire; stronger, faster, practically indestructible. To kill him, or give Elijah an opportunity to kill him, Klaus would need to be at his weakness point. The same way a werewolf would be during their transformation. But to get him there, the curse would need to be broken.“I know that you have every intention of allowing Elena to die,” said Alex.Elijah’s look of surprise would have been comical if not for the subject. “You do?”Alex nodded. “From what I know of you, I know how careful you are with your words. When making that bargain with my sister, you were direct and made sure never to mention her safety.”“But you made sure I did when we made our deal?”“Exactly. So I assume you are here to tell me that you plan for the curse to be broken but that you have a way that will save Elena’s life.”He looked guilty as he nodded. “It seems I have underestimated you.”Alex sighed. “People always do.”It was a strange sensation sitting with Elijah. Over the past week, the time together had been brief but startling. If any other vampire had dared to do such a thing, she would have turned them to ash without hesitation, but the more time she spent around Elijah, the less it was beginning to bother her. And the thought that it wasn’t bothering her also wasn’t as startling as it should be. Alex was also finding herself glad that Elijah had told her his true intentions; she wasn’t angry that he had lied to her or hidden his motives—like she really should have been—but she felt comforted that he had been truthful.“Has your grandmother’s grimoire been useful?” asked Elijah.Alex looked up and nodded. “Thank you for giving it to me.”Elijah said, “It belongs to your family. It is only right that you should have it.”“I am still surprised. You could have given me the key to not only kill your brother but also you.” “Is that your plan?” he asked. “Kill Klaus, then me? Because revealing that was probably not the best idea.”Alex shrugged. She hadn’t really considered what would happen once Klaus was dead. The Council would no doubt expect her to repeat the same process with Elijah. “Whatever my plan may be, you’ll be the last to know.” It was meant to be a tease more than a threat. And it seemed that Elijah picked up on that because a warm smile lit up his face.Taking in his smile, Alex found herself staring. A stare that Elijah noticed. But instead of turning away, embarrassed by her actions, they locked eyes.Elijah asked, “See something you like?”Alex laughed, and it was a genuine laugh. “You are bold, aren’t you.”“I’ve lived a very long time, Alexandra. There is no use in skirting around the edges, so much time is wasted when others don’t just say what they mean.”“I suppose that is true,” agreed Alex.“Your grandmother was a very honest woman.”“Is that your way of saying she was blunt?”“That is one word you could use to describe her.”“How did you meet my grandmother anyway?”“Nadia and I met in New York; both of us running from a past that we couldn’t escape.”“Who were you running from?”“My father.” Elijah looked down as he ran his finger along the bark of the tree. “He has hunted my siblings and me for our entire existence.”“Sounds like a terrible father.”“That is putting it lightly.” Elijah glanced up. “I ran into Nadia in an alleyway; I was cleaning up after dealing with a rather nasty baby vampire that was overindulging.”“You killed the vampire?”He nodded. “I was wrapping up the body when Nadia attacked me.”Alex smirked.“And she packed a hell of a punch. At that time, she was still working for the Council, following their orders like a good soldier. Of course, she didn’t know who I was and that her usual tricks wouldn’t kill me. She only stopped when she noticed the vampire that she had been sent after was dead.”“Sounds like someone I’d like if she kicked your ass.”Elijah laughed. “No doubt.”“So what happened?”“We continued to bump into one another. The Council were sending her after vampire after vampire. Then I witnessed her hesitate. A vampire begged her for mercy, and she froze. Stake in hand, right over the vampire's heart.”Alex had only hesitated once, and that hesitation had led to James almost dying. She had never allowed herself to hesitate again, no matter what they said or how they begged.“Did she let it go?” asked Alex.“No.” Elijah sighed. “The vampire took her hesitation as a chance to fight back and almost killed her. I stepped in and saved her.”“You saved her?”He nodded. “Much to her dismay. Nadia gave me a verbal tongue lashing the whole way home.”“Is this where you tell me that you two fell madly in love, and she changed you for the better? Because if you do, I may vomit.” Alex reached for her families grimoire and placed it back in her lap.Elijah scrunched up his brow. “No, I didn’t fall in love with Nadia.”“So no epic love story?”He laughed. “No, but Nadia did become my closest friend. But she did become my closest friend, and the day I found out she died broke my heart.”Alex wondered what it would have been like for Nadia’s whole perspective on life to change. Was it similar to how Alex had been feeling? Ever since Alex had come back to Mystic Falls, every thought and belief she had was challenged. Vampires were supposed to be monsters, but every action she had seen by the vampires in Elena’s life went against that. Stefan utterly adored Elena; Damon was determined to protect her in his own messed up way, and Caroline was striving to be the best she could be. Even Elijah was different from what she had expected.“Why did you never find out what happened to her?” asked Alex.Elijah’s smile faded, and a look of hurt flashed over him. “I tried, but it seemed that whatever happened was never witnessed by anyone. Her husband—your grandfather—woke up one morning to find her gone; he was left alone to raise your mother.”Alex didn’t know what to think. She hadn’t mentioned anything about her family to James, not wanting to know if he had known about her family but said nothing. Alex had also realised that it was most likely that Renee had known her family, or at least knew about the Ravenwood connection to the Council. It made sense that Renee had ‘accidentally’ come across her; what if they had simply waited for her magic to appear? Alex wanted to know if the Council had any record of her grandmother and her death. But she found that she was scared to ask. What if Alex didn’t like what they had to say? And the reason no one had told her was to protect her.“I don’t mean to upset you,” said Elijah.“I’m not upset; I just have questions. Too many questions.” Alex gripped the grimoire and then stood. “I should probably get home.”Elijah followed and stood. It resulted in them standing almost chest to chest. Alex had to tilt her head back to look up at him. She took a deep breath to try and calm the instant jolt she felt through her body as she took in their proximity.Elijah’s eyes locked with hers, and Alex couldn’t help but stare into their depths. There was so much that she could see, and just like her own mind, Alex could see the questions he had. And while Alex had questions about her family, about Klaus, and the events to come, there was another question that she was burning to ask but didn’t know how to phrase. Did he feel different around her? Did his heart leap in his chest? Because the warmth that flooded through her every time he was near was becoming a comfortable sensation that Alex missed when they were apart.“Alexandra?” Elijah’s eyes became concerned, and he lifted his hand to touch her cheek.If it was any other vampire, any other person, Alex knew without hesitation she would have smacked the hand away and possibly yelled bloody murder at the other person for touching her. But Elijah’s hand was warm on her cheek; the smooth tip of his finger sent sparks rushing down her body.“I should go,” Alex said, but she didn’t move.“If you must,” he said.Neither of them moved. Elijah’s fingers slid along her cheek down her throat to cup the back of her head, lifting her head as he shifted his body closer to her.“Elijah….” His name came out as a whisper, and Alex realised what he was about to do. She should have pushed him away, perhaps set him on fire for even daring such a thing. But she didn’t; in fact, she dared to wonder if his lips would be as soft as his touch.The shrill of a phone snapped both of them out of their bubble. Alex cleared her throat and took a step back, Elijah’s hand fell away from her throat, and instantly she felt cold. Alex frowned and turned to grab her grimoire from where it still rested. She looked back at Elijah, who had pulled his phone from his pocket.‘I have to go,” said Alex. She walked past Elijah, trying not to look back at him because she didn’t know what would happen if she did.“Alexandra, wait,” Elijah called after her.But she didn’t stop. Alex marched back to her car, leaving Elijah standing beside the pond because she couldn’t really take in what had just happened…No, she could. She almost kissed Elijah.
  
    Chapter Text
    Denial was the plan. Alex was going to pretend that nothing had almost happened and no one needed to know. It was going to work, and she would make sure that she was never alone with Elijah again.Alex had come straight back to the house after being with Elijah and, after having a panic attack in her car, had walked in with perfect calm. She called James and told him about the desiccation. They agreed it was a great plan to have in reserve, but they would need to find a spell to do such a thing; it wasn’t in Alex’s grimoire, and Alex refused to contact Elijah to ask Jonas if he had anything. When she came up with nothing, she thought about Bonnie; she could know something. Then she also remembered Mikael, he had been desiccated in a tomb, what witch had done that? So that was her next step.After burning sage to give herself the privacy she needed, Alex called the number that Mikael had called her from.“Alexandra,” he answered.“Mikael, I have a question for you.”He asked. “Is this in regards to Niklaus?”Alex sighed. “Yes, and no.”“What does that mean?”“While I have faith that you will succeed in killing your son—”Mikael cut her off. “He is not my son.”She rolled her eyes. “Whatever. Not having a backup plan would be foolish.”“What does this have to do with me?”“How were you desiccated in that tomb?”“A witch; she tricked me into following her to Charlotte, where she cast a spell and locked me away.”“Do you know her name?”“Abby Bennett.”Alex’s eyes went wide. “Bennett?”“Yes, Bennett.”“Great, thanks.” Hanging up, Alex couldn’t help but smile. Abby Bennett had to be related to Bonnie; that would make tracking her down easier.A few knocks on her bedroom door made Alex lookup.“Come in,” she said.The door opened, and Elena stepped in. Her face was troubled, and she looked shaken.“Are you alright?” asked Alex.Elena shook her head.“What happened?”“Isobel, she’s dead.”“What?” Alex closed her grimoire and jumped off her bed. She walked over to Elena and led her to sit down.Elena squeezed their connected hands and said, “After everything today, I just wanted to do something normal. So Stefan took me to the Grille, and we bumped into Isobel and John. They took me.”Alex’s hands clenched.“John knocked out Stefan with vervain, and Isobel took me to her car.” Elena took a shaky breath. “I begged her to stop, but she wouldn’t.”“Where did she take you?”“To a cemetery.”Alex frowned.“She showed me the tombstone that her parents had made for her when they never found her after she disappeared.”“I don’t understand.”“Klaus compelled her. Isobel said that she searched for Klaus when she left Mystic Falls the last time because of Katherine. They had a plan where they would trade me and the moonstone for Katherine’s freedom. What type of woman would do that to their own child?”Alex rubbed Elena’s shoulder.“But it seemed that after Isobel found Klaus, you killed Katherine, and that news got back to Klaus. So instead, Klaus used Isobel to mess with me.”“He wanted to scare you.”Elena nodded. “Isobel said that Klaus told her to tell me that nothing will stop him. Not Stefan or Damon or you.”Alex’s jaw clenched. She couldn’t wait to kill the fucker. “Who killed Isobel?”Elena took a shaky breath. “She got a phone call, and then she apologised for being such a disappointment to me. After that, she pulled off her spelled necklace and burnt to death.”Alex squeezed Elena close. “I am so sorry you had to witness that.”“I don’t understand why he would do such a thing?” she asked.Alex placed her chin on Elena’s head. “Because Klaus is a monster.”Elena stayed in Alex’s room that night. There was no talk of Klaus or the curse, nothing about the supernatural. It was just two sisters curled up in bed watching a movie on Elena’s laptop. They giggled at the corny romance comedy playing and found themselves enjoying some much-needed sister bonding.The next morning was hard for both of them to get up, but it was the day of the 60’s dance at school, and Elena knew that Caroline wouldn’t let her escape it. To make her sister feel better, Alex agreed to go and keep an eye on things. She would have to put up with Damon’s crap, but it would be worth it if Elena could enjoy the simple things.And it seemed as the day went on that Alex found that nothing supernatural was going to occur. Alex had spoken with James, but only a check-up on his research but also to ask him to look for Abby Bennett. Alex planned on speaking with Bonnie, but for now, she wanted to see if she could avoid telling anyone else. The rest of her day was spent in the house, finding ways to occupy her mind and not think about the almost kiss she shared with Elijah.It seemed that her mind, however, was intent on replaying it for her. Alex was struggling to understand why she felt so drawn to him, and if he was a human or a witch—maybe she could understand the attraction—but he wasn’t either of those things. Elijah was supposed to be her enemy, one of the Original Vampires. Alex should be disgusted, but instead, she found herself thinking about his touch and how her body had reacted. It was bad enough that he was a vampire, but Alex couldn’t believe that she would cheat on James.James had been her rock through so many things. He had helped her heal after her parents; he had helped her find out who she was. James was the man she loved, and no amount of attraction would make her betray him.Alex was glad when Elena and Jeremy got home, but then she also spotted some tension. She came downstairs to see Elena standing in the kitchen and Jeremy in the dining room. They were looking at each other intently.“What’s going on here?” asked Alex.Elena turned to look at her and then back at Jeremy. “It seems that Jeremy and Bonnie are dating.”Alex smiled. “You asked her out? Good for you.”Elena frowned. “You knew?”Alex shrugged. “They weren’t exactly subtle.”Jeremy said, “I don’t know why you are so bothered by it.”“I’m not bothered by it,” said Elena, “in fact, I’m happy for the both of you.”“That wasn’t what it seemed like when you saw us kissing.”Elena huffed. “How did you expect me to react when I saw my little brother shove his tongue down my best friends throat?”Alex chuckled. “Go, Jeremy.”Jeremy cracked a smile and glanced at Alex. “Really?”“What? This is probably the most normal conversation we have all had.” Alex walked over to Elena and placed her arm over her shoulder. “And yes, it will be weird that your best friend and brother are dating, but guess what, you’ll get used to it.”Elena nodded. “I know; I was just surprised.”“Great,” said Jeremy. “Now, if you will excuse me, I have to get ready and go pick up my date.” He winked at his sisters before heading towards the stairs.“Where did you catch them?” asked Alex.Elena frowned. “In the hallway.”“That’s not really catching them.”“I know. But I didn’t expect to walk around the corner and see that.”Alex laughed. “No, I suppose not.”“There is something else that you need to know,” said Elena.“What?”“Klaus compelled one of the girls at school today.”Alex stiffened. He was in town.“He asked me to save him a dance tonight.”Alex nodded. “I will find him and make him regret ever coming after you.”Elena grasped Alex’s hand. “What if we can’t stop him?”Alex offered her a smile. “I haven’t met a vampire that has bested me yet. He will be no different.”Elena nodded.They shared a tight hug before Elena turned to head upstairs.For the dance, Jeremy and Elena both looked great. Jeremy left to pick up Bonnie, and Stefan showed up to collect Elena. Alex promised to see them there before waving them off. She needed to make a phone call before she left.Sitting on the edge of her bed, Alex had been dreading calling Renee for a while. She would need to provide the Council with an update on her progress, but she also wanted to ask about Nadia.Holding her phone in her hand, Alex frowned when it rang before she dialled. Renee’s name flashing.Alex answered, “Hello, Renee.”Renee asked, “Alex, do you have an update?”Alex nodded. “Yes. It seems Klaus is on his way.”“And?”“And I currently have three solutions.”“That’s great to hear. Any of them foolproof?”Alex sighed. “I would love to say yes, but I am dealing with an Original.”“Three, according to James.”Alex clenched his jaw. She sometimes forgot James provided updates too.“Mikael, Elijah and Klaus. It sounds like you have your hands full.” Renee’s footsteps echoed through the phone, followed by a scream. “Would you like me to send additional support?”“No. But at least one Original will be dead by the end of this, guaranteed.”“We have faith in you, Alex. Don’t disappoint us.”“I won’t.”Renee let out a small pleased sigh. She said, “That’s what I like to hear. I’ll speak to you soon—”Alex jumped in before she could hang up. “Wait, Renee.”“Yes.”Alex didn’t know where to start. For days the question regarding her family had circled her mind. How was she supposed to bring it up with Renee?“I don’t have all day,” snapped Renee.“Nadia Ravenwood.”There was silence on the line for a few moments.Renee asked, “What about her?”“Why did no one tell me about her?” asked Alex.Renee cleared her throat, and her footsteps stopped. “The Council didn’t want to have the mistakes made by previous family members affect your decisions.”Alex frowned. “And what about the fact that the Ravenwood family were one of the original families to set up the Council.”Renee let out a heavy sigh. “Alex, you have always made it abundantly clear that your biological family didn’t matter. The Gilberts were your family. When you never pushed for information about where you came from, I figured you never wanted to know.”“The option would have been appreciated.”“When you complete your mission, I will have every file regarding your family lineage pulled for you.”“Thank you.”“You are welcome.”The line went dead.Alex was once again left with uncertainty. Had it really been that easy all along to find out about her family? Alex had always felt that there was nothing to find. When she had looked on her own, there had never been anything.Glancing at the time, Alex knew she needed to go to the dance.Alex didn’t dress up in the sixies clothing, but she pulled on a black form-fitting dressed and heels. She drove down to the school and made her way through the teenagers that were all making their way into the gym. Her eyes went across the room, looking for anyone that stood out, but no one caught her eye.She made her way along the edge of the room and spotted Jeremy walk in with Bonnie. She dragged him straight onto the dance floor—much to Jeremy’s disgust—and Alex laughed at her brother’s attempts to dance along with Bonnie.A few minutes later, Elena walked in with Stefan. Alex could see the tension on their faces. They both were looking around, trying to spot Klaus. The twisting in Alex’s stomach warned of Damon stepping up beside her before he spoke.“Elena tell you about her message?” he asked.“From Klaus? Yes.”Damon nodded.Elena and Stefan made their way over.“I know everyone here,” said Elena.Alex smiled. “Try and enjoy tonight. I will look for Klaus.”“I’ll help,” said Damon.Alex walked to tell him to fuck off, but she knew it would be helpful to have someone else keeping an eye out.“Thanks for being here, everybody.”They all turned to see a blonde standing on stage.“We have a special shout-out tonight,” she said. “This is for Elena. From Klaus.”The song switched, and Alex looked around the room. She couldn’t see anyone that was watching Elena, but she did spot Alaric.“That was a lame, cheap shot. He’s trying to bait us,” said Damon.“Maybe he’s not here. Just wants us to believe that he is,” said Stefan.Alex sighed. “You two,” she pointed at Stefan and Elena, “go dance.”Elena sighed heavily but nodded.“You,” Alex turned to Damon. “Go find out if Alaric has seen anything.”Damon frowned but didn’t argue.The dance was too normal for Alex’s liking. She was having flashbacks to her own high school dances that she never really enjoyed. She kept an eye on Elena, who was always either with Stefan or Damon.As the song changed again to a slow song, Alaric walked over to her. He offered her a smile and said, “You like you’re having a ball.”Alex huffed out a laugh. “Oh yeah, it’s a raging party.”Alaric laughed. “How about a dance?”Alex frowned at him. “What?”“Oh, come on,” he said, “have a little fun.” He took Alex’s hand and pulled her into the group of teenagers.Alex was ready to protest but just went with it. They swayed to the music, but Alex kept an eye on Elena.Alaric broke their silence and asked, “High school dancers weren’t ever your thing, were they?”“No. I hated them.”“Is that why you took off before graduation?” he asked.“No. That was because I was worried I would roast my entire family if my parents yelled at him.”Alaric smirked, almost like he was amused. “Really?”“Yes. Why so interested in my past?” Alex asked.He shrugged. “Just getting to know my girlfriend’s family. After all, I know so much about Elena, but not much about you. In fact, I had no idea you even existed until you showed up.”Alex frowned. That wasn’t right. Jenna had told Alaric about her, and there were photos around the house. Alaric had spent enough time there to know about her.“Alex!” Elena appeared beside them.“Hey, what’s wrong?” she asked.“It’s Jeremy. He took off outside.”Alex pulled away from Alaric. “You stay here; I’ll go find him.”Walking away from them, Alex spotted Bonnie. She chased after her and followed her outside to find Jeremy standing with Stefan and Damon.“What happened?” she asked.Jeremy was holding a towel to his nose. “Klaus compelled some assholes to jump me.”Alex frowned.“Why is he doing all this?” asked Bonnie.“To distract us,” said Alex.Damon’s head snapped up. “Whose with Elena?”“Alaric,” said Alex.Damon relaxed. “Good.”Alex shook her head; it wasn’t good. Alaric had been acting strange for days, and all of the people Klaus had been controlling were students. And his questions about Alex past had been weird.“We need to find them now.” Alex turned to rush back inside.“Why?” asked Stefan.“Let’s just say I don’t think Alaric is himself at the moment.”Elena and Alaric were both missing from the gym. Alex and Stefan made their way into the hallways while Damon checked outside. Bonnie stayed with Jeremy to make sure he stayed out of trouble. Alex turned down one hallway and paused when she saw Stefan turn his head.“Can you hear them?” she asked.Stefan nodded. “Down here.”They raced around the corner and found Alaric standing with Elena pressed against the lockers.“No, no. It’s no possible,” said Elena.Alaric smirked. “But it is.”“Get away from her,” yelled Alex.Alaric turned and laughed. “Here she is, the hero of the hour.”“Alaric, did Klaus compel you?” asked Stefan.Alaric’s laughter grew. “No. Keep up, mate.”Alex felt sick when she realised what was going on. Klaus had possessed Alaric. “You bastard,” she said.Klaus shrugged. “What can I say? It’s fun.”“How is that even possible?” asked Stefan.“Not all witches hate vampires as much as big sis does.” Klaus winked at Alex. “Mind you, I don’t think you all know how much she hates our kind, mate.” He took a step towards them. “Shall we tell them about your Council?”Alex clenched her hands and reacted. She lifted her arm and sent Klaus flying down the corridor away from Elena. “Get Elena out of here.”Stefan didn’t hesitate, leaving Alex alone with a possessed Alaric.“You know, I didn’t expect my doppelganger to have such a powerful family member.” Klaus pushed himself to stand. “But now that I’ve met you, I think it just makes it all that more exciting.”Alex scoffed. “You really think this is a game.”He nodded. “Of course it is. I’m just having fun. But when the full moon arrives, I’ll be done playing.”“You won’t see another full moon,” said Alex.Klaus laughed. “Oh, you are fun, love.”Alex sneered and threw him further down the hall.“Alex?” Damon’s voice made Alex turn.He appeared behind her and frowned. “Where is he?”Alex turned back to see Klaus missing. He was gone. “Shit.”“You let him get away.”She glared at Damon. “Klaus is inside Alaric. There isn’t much we can do to him unless you want me to hurt Alaric too.”Damon’s jaw clenched and remained shut.Alex turned away from him and headed back towards the gym. Klaus would be done for the night; he’d messed with all of them, but there was no hiding now. He was inside Alaric, and while there was nothing to stop him from possessing someone else, Alex knew what to look for now. It wasn’t another vampire, but another witch.
  
    Chapter Text
    It probably should have been something that Alex could have predicted. Klaus was known to be elusive and manipulative. His plan of possessing Alaric to spy on them would have been clever if it hadn’t been used against them. There was no way to know how long Klaus had been in control until they got Alaric back. Alex knew that for certain it had happened since she had returned, and it had only been a few weeks; there was something she had missed.Damon and Stefan checked the whole school and confirmed that Klaus—or Alaric—was gone. There was no sight of him. Jeremy had already left with Bonnie, and it seemed that Caroline hadn’t known what was going on at all.Alex found Elena standing out in the car park with Stefan. When she approached them, Elena rushed over to hug her.“Are you alright?” asked Elena.Alex nodded. “I’m fine.”“Will Alaric be alright?” asked Stefan.“If we can get Klaus out, he should be fine,” said Alex.“How do we do that?” asked Elena.“We don’t. I do. But first, we need to find him.” Alex pulled out her phone and called James.“Hey, how was the dance?” James asked.“Informative,” said Alex.“What?” asked James, confused.“Klaus is possessing Alaric’s body.”“Shit.”“Exactly.” Alex rubbed the back of her neck. “I need you and Robert to search for any witches you can find. Klaus has at least one witch working for him and would need to be in Mystic Falls to take over Alaric.”“Yeah, no problem. I’ll call you back once we have something.”“Great, thank you.” Alex hung up her phone and considered her next step.“Who’s Robert?” asked Elena.“Someone from the Council?” asked Stefan.Alex frowned. Klaus had to open that can of worms.“There’s no Robert on the Council,” said Damon.“I don’t think Alaric—Klaus was referring to the town’s Council.” Stefan crossed his arms.“There’s another Council?” Damon looked between Alex and Stefan.“They don’t matter right now,” said Alex. By ignoring their questions, Alex knew that it would only make them want to know more. But she needed to find Klaus and get him out of Alaric.“You sure?” pushed Stefan. “Because when Klaus brought them up, you looked like a deer in headlights.”“Thank you for your cliches, but we don’t have time for this.” Alex moved past them. “Elena, go home. Tell Jenna and stay there until I call you.”“Alex, wait.” Elena followed her to her car.“Elena, please.”Elena took Alex’s hands and said, “I thought we agreed to no more secrets.”Alex sighed and couldn’t argue; she didn’t want to lie to Elena; she never had. But she knew that once she explained it, there would be no going back. But it was too frustrating to try and keep everything together with some much happening.The look that Elena was giving Alex made her want to explain everything and help Elena understand why she viewed the world differently. Elena knew small pieces, the bits that Alex had given her to help them reach what Alex had hoped would be their peace throughout the whole thing, but it seemed that there was no lying about it anymore.Alex dropped her head and said, “The Council are my coven.”“Why does that need to be a big secret?” asked Elena, her eyes lighting up with determination to know the truth.Alex sighed heavily. “Because the Council’s whole existence is for the sole purpose of destroying every single vampire. Not just Klaus and Katherine, but Stefan and Damon, and Caroline.”Elena let go of Alex and took a step back. The revelation wasn’t exactly what she had been expecting, and the look in her eyes told Alex that Elena didn’t see her in the same way anymore. Elena asked, “That’s the reason you came back? To kill them.”“Yeah.” Alex’s shoulders slumped. She wanted to scream. “I came back to rid you of these monsters that have caused you nothing but suffering since they showed up.”“They aren’t monsters.”“Yes, they are.” Alex grabbed Elena’s shoulders. “I know that you want to believe that they are good, but they aren’t. They are unnatural beasts that shouldn’t exist. All because one selfish witch was too scared to lose her children, she changed the course of the world for the worst.”“You really believe that?”“I do.”Alex wanted to be sorry that she couldn’t accept what Elena wanted her to. She knew that Elena had hoped that she would be able to move past her hatred for them and see a different side, but how could she. Alex had seen too much to ever look at any of them as anything other than monsters. Her only regret was that Elena would be hurt because of it.Elena nodded her head slowly before turning to walk back towards Stefan. Both of the Salvatore’s had waited as the two sisters spoke, no doubt listening to every word. And as much as Alex wanted to fix things with Elena, there was no time.Alex left Elena with the Salvatore’s, knowing that things would be complicated when they met again. She climbed into her car and messaged Jenna to get Alaric’s apartment number. It made sense that Klaus—or at least his witch—was hold up in Alaric’s apartment. Alex hoped she could find something, maybe even Klaus’ empty shell.The street was quiet as Alex parked across the road from Alaric’s apartment building. She looked around and noticed that it was almost too quiet like everyone had been warned to stay inside. Ignoring the strange air, Alex walked inside and headed up the stairs.The door to Alaric’s apartment was open, and Elijah stood on one side of the threshold. He was leaning against the doorframe, a frustrated look on his face. On the other side was Jonas, except he looked distraught instead of frustrated.Elijah turned as Alex reached the landing. “Alexandra.”“What are you doing here?” she asked.“It seems that my brother has employed one of his favourite pastimes and has possessed the body of the high school history teacher,” he explained.Alex frowned. “Elena?”Elijah nodded.She must have called him after Alex had left.“She explained the events at the dance. I suspected Niklaus may be keeping his body here, but it appears he was one step ahead of us.” Elijah pushed away from the door and moved towards her.“I had hoped the same thing.” Alex gripped the railing beside her and looked past Elijah to Jonas.The man had tears starting to fall from his eyes.Elijah said, “Elena explained that you faced my brother tonight; are you alright?”Alex nodded. “I am fine. It was your brother inside a human body, not exactly dangerous. He was just an antagonistic ass.”Elijah exhaled. “Yes, he can be.”“Is Jonas alright?” she asked.Jonas heard her question and wiped the tears from his face.Elijah frowned. “Jonas was hoping to find Klaus’ witch.”Alex frowned. “Another detail you haven’t mentioned?”“Jonas’ personal motives are his own. They are not mine to share.”Alex nodded and turned to leave. There was no point in staying at the apartment if there was no trace of Klaus. It seemed likely that the residence Klaus was using would be somewhere in town, but with a witch on his side, it was most likely cloaked by now.“Where are you heading now?” asked Elijah; he followed Alex down the stairs and out the front door.“Home. I have to make sure my Aunt is aware that her boyfriend is possessed by an Original Vampire.”Alex went to cross the road, back Elijah reached out to grab her arm.“Alexandra?”“Yes?” Alex turned back to face him.Elijah was concerned, his eyes were watching her, and his jaw was tight.“I have to go,” said Alex. She wasn’t sure what exactly he wanted to say, but she somehow thought that it might have had to do with their last meeting.“I know. I just want you to be safe.” The hand that held her forearm gently rubbed her arm.Alex nodded. “I will be.”Alex felt Elijah’s eyes on her as she crossed the road, climbed into her car and drove away. Her upper arm was burning from where he had touched her. It wasn’t something that Alex had time to think about, she had a family to keep safe and a vampire to kill—somehow. *** James was in the driveway when Alex pulled up. He had a serious look on his face, but he also seemed ready. He reached out for Alex as she came around her car and wrapped her in a tight hug, where he pressed a kiss to the top of her head before leading her towards the porch.“Is everyone okay?” he asked.Alex nodded. “For the moment. Did you find anything?”“Nothing on another witch; they are probably in a cloaked location,” said James.Alex frowned. That wasn’t good.“I did, however, find out some interesting information on Abby Bennett.”For a moment, Alex grew excited. “What?” she asked.“Abby Bennett is Bonnie’s mother.”“Really?”James nodded. “With what records I could find, the last details of her were from when you were all kids. Don’t you remember her?”Alex shrugged. “Bonnie was Elena’s friend, not mine. I wasn’t exactly the social butterfly.”“Well, since she left Mystic Falls, there is no trace of an Abby Bennett,” said James.“Bonnie might know more.” She’d need to talk to Bonnie as soon as possible. Alex climbed up the porch and reached for the front door.“All I need is a name,” said James.Inside, Alex froze. She had expected to find the table full, but not the scene before her. Alaric—Klaus was standing at the head on the table behind a tied up Jenna. He was holding a knife to her throat.“Alexandra, how nice of you to join us.” Klaus sighed happily and leant closer to Jenna’s ear. “If only Jeremy were here, it would be a whole family affair.” He laughed.To Jenna’s right sat Elena; her eyes were locked on the knife at Jenna’s throat. On the other side of the table was Stefan; he was watching every movement Klaus made.“Who is your friend?” asked Klaus.James took a step forward. “Klaus, I presume?”Klaus smiled. “That I am. Sadly I’m not looking my best at the moment, but I’ll be back to being me in no time at all. I just have a few questions before I go.”Alex lifted her hand; she was ready to knock the ass right through the doors behind him.“Don’t you dare Alexandra,” said Klaus. “Drop the hands.”“What do you want?” asked Alex.Klaus glanced around the room, his smile never wavering. “A few things; the moonstone, my doppelganger, the break the curse…oh. There’s also the question about my brother. How long have you two been entangled?” He wiggled his eyebrows and smirked.James glanced at Alex. “What are you talking about?”Klaus huffed. “Elijah, my big brother. I know he’s conspiring against me; he’s holding a little grudge because of the placement of our siblings.” He tapped his finger against the handle of the knife. “But I had no idea he mixed business and pleasure. He used to scold me like a child when I did such a thing.”Alex felt her stomach twist. He had already caused a divide between her and Elena; the real truth about what she didn’t hadn’t been told in full, but Alex knew that Elena probably didn’t trust her anyone. But it seemed that Klaus was also intent on making it seem like something had happened with Elijah. And while Alex knew nothing had happened, the way she reacted to Elijah—physically and mentally—was just as bad.“Elijah is nothing more than a means to an end—your end,” said Alex.Klaus rolled his eyes. “Is that why you two can’t seem to keep your eyes off each other? And all that time you’ve spent together down by that pond?”It was like a shot to her gut. How had Klaus known?“Enough of this,” snapped James. He stepped forward.Klaus frowned. “I wasn’t finished.”Alex lifted her hand and shouted. “Statuam!”Klaus’ mouth froze, as did Alaric’s body. James took that moment to dash forward and pry the knife from Klaus’ fingers before she threw him backwards. He crashed through the glass doors, shards flying out in every direction. Klaus let out a groan of pain as he hit the ground, but he didn’t stay still for long.James moved quickly, cutting Jenna’s binds and passing her off to Elena, who hugged her close and started apologising at the same time. Alex moved towards them and pushed them out of the dining room as she followed James out onto the porch. James had grabbed Klaus as he tried to stand and shoved him back down, rolling him over and pressing a knee into his back.“Who’s laughing now?” mocked James.Klaus groaned. “I will be when I rip your heart out of your chest and feed it to your girlfriend.”“Oh, shut up,” said Alex.“Do you have a release spell in your grimoire?” asked James.Alex nodded. “Yeah. I’ll go grab it. Tie him up in the living room.”Moving back inside, she noticed that Jenna and Elena were gone. “Where’d they go?” she asked Stefan.Stefan sighed. “Upstairs, I was just waiting to see if you needed help?”Alex nodded. “Help James, keep Klaus from escaping would be great.”“With pleasure.”Alex raced up the stairs to her bedroom; she could hear Jenna crying and Elena trying to console her, but instead of doing what she wanted—which was to check on them—she grabbed her grimoire from her bed and pulled open the top drawer of her dresser. She grabbed the candles and the herbs she would need before running back down the stairs.She was in time to hear James call out and for Stefan to come crashing into the hallway and hit the ground. Alex moved around him to see a man helping Klaus up from the ground. The man buzzed with power, Alex’s body reacting to the energy that was radiating off him—a witch. They locked eyes, and a pleased smile greeted her.“Alexandra Ravenwood, I have heard about you.” He shifted Klaus to stand behind him. “I will enjoy wiping you from the earth.”Alex huffed as Klaus stepped out of her sight. “It’s Gilbert.” She threw up her hand and sent the man flying.She placed down her stuff and rushed out the door to find James unconscious and Klaus gone. The man was pushing himself to stand, a look of enjoyment spreading across his face.“What kind of witch lowers themselves to serve a vampire?” she asked.He laughed, and if it wasn’t so incredibly weird, his laugh would have sounded elated. “Klaus is Nature’s most brilliant creation. He is worthy of our allegiance.”Alex was stunned by his words. “You sound insane.”“No, not insane. I’m just enlightened.”The force that came crashing into her chest sent Alex flying back and into the fence. She let out a grunt and fell to her knees. Alex pushed herself up to stand, ignoring the sharp pains in her back. The witch was moving towards her, excitement flashing. Alex threw what she could at him, her magic throwing him to the side and crashing into the wooden bench. The bench crumbled beneath his weight.Alex took a movement to breathe as the pains in her back screamed at her. The male witch seemed to have stopped moving.“Alex, are you alright?” Stefan’s voice called out.Looking up, Alex spotted him kneeling by James’ unconscious body. Alex waved him off before moving towards the witch.As she knelt beside him, she heard a gargled gasp. Alex grabbed the mans arm and rolled him onto his back, exposing his stomach and the splintered piece of wood embedded in his side. A large pool of blood had already coated the ground, and the man barely had his eyes open.“Shit.”Alex placed her hand on the man’s side; closing her eyes, she tried to heal him or at least slow down the bleeding. She could feel the witch’s life force fading, and it seemed that she wouldn’t be able to stop it.“No,” she said, “no, you fucking don’t.”With one last gargled breathe, the witches body sagged onto the ground.A lump formed in Alex’s throat as she opened her eyes.“Alex?” Stefan’s voice reached her ears.She couldn’t find the words to respond; she had just killed someone. And they weren’t a vampire; it was another human being. A sob tore out of her chest as a hand touched her shoulder. Her magic twisted as Stefan knelt down beside her, but she found herself leaning into him.“Oh my god, what happened?” Elena’s words snapped Alex out of her shock.Pulling away from Stefan, she looked down at her blood-soaked hands and stood up.“Alex? Stefan?” Elena reached them. “Is he…?”“Dead,” said Stefan.Alex turned away and moved back towards the house. She passed James, who was still unconscious but breathing and headed straight for the front door.“Alex, wait!” called Elena.But she didn’t.
  
    Chapter Text
    The air was still; the only sounds that surrounded Alex was the movement of the river below. She was struggling to calm her mind; her thoughts were racing, and she struggled to comprehend what she had done. Alex had fort against vampires; killing them was easy after a while, but the guilt had never been anything like the sensation that was swirling in her chest. Killing a monster wasn’t a bad thing, but killing another witch…killing her own kin, that made her the monster.Alex buried her fingers into her hair, trying to take deep breathes to steady the racing beat of her heart and to stop the tears from falling. The salt was already burning her eyes, but she didn’t want them to fall; Alex didn’t want any of it to be real.A tear hit the concrete rail that she leaned against. The splatter made her waining strength fail and a sob wracked through her. Alex was a murderer, and she hated herself for it. A witches life had been taken too soon, and that made her no better than the monsters she tried to protect everyone from.Looking up from the railing, Alex looked out over the river. She had driven out to Wickery Bridge without really thinking about her destination. Her body had brought her here, and she hated it. Wickery Bridge seemed to be a convergence of everything that could go wrong with her life. Her parents had died going off this bridge, and Elena had almost been lost with them.Wiping at her cheeks, Alex pushed away from the railing. She wanted to scream; she wanted to let go of the control she had of her magic and watch it crumble the bridge beneath her feet. And if it was to bury her beneath the rumble, then so be it.Never before had Alex wanted her magic to disappear. Even when she had been terrified by her sudden abilities, even when she struggled to learn control, Alex had never once wished she was normal – being a witch was who she was – but now she wanted for it to go. Why did she have to be a witch? Why did Elena have to be a doppelganger? Why did Alex get to live while that witch died? It didn’t matter that he had stood by Klaus; there could be several reasons that the witch had been so blindly loyal; manipulation being the strongest possibility. Klaus was the one who deserved to have his unnatural life taken from him, not that witch.Alex’s phone started to ring from inside her car. It was the fourth time since she had left the house, running from the death she had caused. Alex hadn’t looked at her phone; she didn’t want to talk to anyone. She wanted to be left alone. But she knew they wouldn’t stop. Alex had already felt the sensation of a tracking spell touch her, but she had learned awhile ago how to throw off her actual location. Alex walked over to her car and climbed inside; her phone was sitting on the passenger seat. Picking it up, she had three missed calls from Elena, and James was currently calling her.Alex leant her back against the headrest of her seat and answered.“Alex? Are you okay?” asked James. It was rushed, and he was panting.“Stop trying to find me,” she grumbled.James scoffed. “I woke up and found you gone. No one knows where you are.”“I just need to be left alone.”“Alex, please—”Alex shook her head. “James, I…” She couldn’t find the words.“You didn’t mean to, Alex. It was an accident,” said James.“Was it?” she asked. “There were a number of different things I could have done. I didn’t have to throw him into that bench. Maybe subconsciously, I did want to kill him.”James sighed. “That is ridiculous. You aren’t a murderer.”Alex closed her eyes and sunk lower into her seat. “We are going to have to disagree on that.”“Please, just come home. Elena is scared; she needs you.” His voice wavered.Fresh tears stained Alex’s cheeks. Elena. The reason Alex was so determined to win. Maybe her protective instincts were what drove her to do such a thing. “I’m sorry.” Alex disconnected the call and turned her phone off. No more calls; she just wanted to be on her own.Climbing out of her car, Alex walked away from the bridge and into the trees. They were woods that she had walked through hundreds of times. She had traversed them with Elena, her friends, with boys. They were still familiar, and as she wondered, not really watching where she stepped, she wondered if she could lose herself in them.Alex stumbled over a root, catching herself with the base of another tree. Her foot throbbed from the awkward angle it had been pulled at, and Alex lowered herself to the ground. She pulled her knees to her chest and rested her head on them. She deserved more than a throbbing foot.“This is an interesting spot to rest.”Alex’s head snapped up, the brush around her bursting into flames and igniting in a circle around the person who had spoken. Taking a moment for her eyes to adjust, Alex saw Mikael. He was holding a delicately carved stake in one hand, and unlike the last time she had seen him, he was dressed in fresh clothing.“I didn’t mean to startle you,” said Mikael.Alex pushed herself to stand. Her skin was crawling at the sensation of him being so close. She tried to hide the fact that she had been crying, that she had fallen to his level. “You got the stake.”Mikael nodded. “I did. How have you gone locating Niklaus?”“I found him. Inside the body of another.” Alex kept her voice level, using every ounce of control to keep herself strong.“He switched bodies?” he asked.“With a human high school teacher. One close to my family.”“Mind games. A tool used by the weak.” Mikael scrunches up his face in disgust. “Does he still possess this human?”Alex frowned. She hadn’t actually noticed where Klaus had gone. Did he run while they were distracted by his witch? Or had they managed to bind him and kick him out of Alaric’s body?“I don’t know,” she said.Mikael sighed. “I guess I’ll have to kill the human to get him back into his own body.”Alex glared. “No. The only one dying will be Klaus.”“Collateral damage is bound to happen. Niklaus will throw every innocent he can between us and him; you are going to have to accept that people will die.”Alex shook her head. Not if she had anything to do with it. “No one dies.”Mikael rolled his eyes. “And what of Elijah?”Alex didn’t know what to say. She had never mentioned Elijah to him. But he could have been lurking without any one of them knowing. He had been tracking Klaus for a thousand years. “What about him?”“Well, I wondered what you would do if he gets in your way. He may want to kill the half-breed at this moment, but what’s to say he won’t have a change of heart? Maybe Klaus will manipulate Elijah, turn him against you.”“Elijah has his own plan. If he changes his plan, I have no problem with killing him that same as Klaus. He knows that.”“It would be a rather good show to see you try and take down both of them. Two originals versus one powerful witch. Maybe I should sit back and see what happens?”“You would risk that? If I die and Klaus breaks his curse, he’ll be even more powerful. And what makes you think that if you couldn’t kill him for a thousand years while he was bound that you could kill him when the curse is broken?”“I could always kill the doppelganger.”The flames around Mikael flared. Alex said, “You touch her, and I’ll do worse than desiccate you.”Mikael chuckled. “You may be a powerful witch, but don’t think I’ll be surprised by that little trick again. I’m not letting anyone stand between me and killing that waste of air. Niklaus will die by my hand; you can be assured of that.”“And I can assure you that if you go anywhere near my sister, it will be Klaus watching your body burn and not you watching his.” Alex took a step closer to Mikael. She knew it would be dangerous dealing with Mikael; he was still a vampire and had his own agenda. Really she should have felt the same way about Elijah, but somehow, Alex felt that Elijah would honour his word. Mikael, not so much.Mikael smirked. “You are quite the feisty little witch.”Alex glared at him.“If you do find Niklaus before I, let me know. Otherwise, I’ll see you when his body is bursting into flames. Now, if you don’t mind.” He glanced at the flames encasing him.Alex considered binding him in the circle until the moon set, but she didn’t want to piss him off, so that he went ahead and killed Elena anyone. She wanted to avoid anyone else dying because of her. Alex dropped the spell, and Mikael disappeared into the night air. As he disappeared, her whole body sagged, and she gasped as her body trembled.Looking around at the silent woods around her, Alex headed back in the direction toward the road. Even though she had wandered, she knew where she was. Her head was a muddle of thoughts and feelings; she couldn’t stop the panic building as she thought about everything she needed to deal with. Klaus, Mikael, the Council, keeping Elena safe, Elijah, James. It was almost too much, and she felt sick.Alex reached the road and paused to lean against the side. She rested her head on the cold metal and closed her eyes; she couldn’t go home, not yet. Alex didn’t want to know what they had done with the body; they probably buried him somewhere in the woods. She didn’t want to explain that someone else was threatening Elena’s life or that she felt like she was falling apart at the seams. Alex just wanted to curl up and go to sleep.Getting into her car, Alex turned back on her phone. As the screen lit up, several notifications lit up her screen. Missed Call from Elena. Missed Call from Elena. Missed Call from James. Text Message from Elena. Text Message from James. Alex took a shaky breath and opened the messages.From James, she got: Alex, please just come home. I just want to know your safe. Come to my hotel if you prefer.From Elena, it said: Alex, I’m worried. Please just let me know you are okay. James said he spoke to you, but he seems scared. Just text or call, please.Alex leant her head on the steering wheel. To Elena, she sent: I’m okay. And to James, she sent: I need space. She didn’t know if she would get a response; the time on her phone read 1 am, she had been gone for hours. Opening her contacts, Alex scrolled, looking through the different people she could call and stopped when she saw Elijah’s name.Everything was so confusing. Elijah was a vampire, she should want nothing to do with him, but instead, everything about him drew her in. His smell, the way he spoke. There seemed to be some kind of magnetism that Alex had never felt before. The repulsion that she normally felt towards vampires was nowhere to be felt; instead, she felt safe whenever she was with him. And that was what she wanted right now, was to feel safe.She dialled his number before she could think anymore about it.“Alexandra?”“Elijah,” said Alex, her voice cracking.“What’s the matter? Are you alright?” he asked. The concern in his voice made Alex’s heart jump.“I-I-I…” She couldn’t get it out. What did she say? Alex had been on her high horse every second since she had arrived in town, and now she had lowered herself to a point she thought she never would.“Where are you?” he asked.“Wickery Bridge,” she whispered.The call didn’t disconnect, but she could hear the rustle of movement, the sound of wind blowing past. Elijah was running to her. She thought that perhaps she would drive to meet him, but as she saged against the seat, she felt relief that he was coming to her.Alex’s car door was suddenly pulled open, and Elijah was kneeling beside her. He lifted a hand to cup her cheek. He turned her face towards him, his thumb wiping away the traces of her tears.“Alexandra?” His voice was low, soft and comforting.Alex grasped at the wrist of the hand holding her face. His skin burned against hers. Alex nuzzled her face into his palm, feeling a sense of calm wash through her. It wasn’t enough to take the pain, to remove the layer of disgust she felt about herself, but it calmed her racing heart.“I think I should take you home,” he said.Alex shook her head. She reached with her other hand to grasp his shoulder. “No, please.”Elijah frowned. “What if I take you back to my place?”Alex nodded. Anywhere was better than her family home.Elijah’s arms slid around her and lifted her room her spot in the driver’s seat; he moved her through the car and carefully placed her down in the passenger seat, where he pulled the seat buckle over her before brushing her hair from her face.Alex felt the car start, and she shifted in her seat as Elijah reached over and took her hand. She wrapped both hands around his hand, seeking that burn when their skin met. Alex felt Elijah’s eyes on her for just a moment before he shifted the car into gear and drove out over Wickery Bridge.Neither of them spoke as Elijah drove. Alex found herself unable to contain fresh tears when they fell, and while she was embarrassed to cry in front of Elijah, he said nothing. Elijah kept hold of her hand, rubbing his thumb over her knuckle in a soothing motion. The sensation allowed Alex to relax and her eyes to droop. She was tired.
  
    Chapter Text
    The smell of coffee is what roused Alex from her sleep. She let out a soft groan as she took in the warm bundle she was encased in. The pillow beneath her head felt like a cloud; the sheets around her bare legs were like silk. Alex frowned as she blinked open her eyes, slowly adjusting to the bright light in the room. It was a place she had never seen before, and she couldn’t remember climbing into the bed.Alex sat up and rubbed her eyes. It took a moment as she took in the room with its cream carpeted floors, the large open windows, the ceiling high bookshelves, for the events of the previous night to come flooding back. Alex pulled her knees to her chest as she remembered Klaus, the witch that had arrived to save him and how she had killed him. The conversation with Mikael and how her heart had pounded in her ears. And how she called Elijah.The idea that she had fallen asleep in a car with a vampire was shocking all on its own. Alex had let her guard down around a vampire since she had learned about their existence. Her body had never let her grow comfortable enough to simply drift off. But with Elijah, she had. In fact, she had craved his touch, sort out his comfort and had wanted nothing more than to bury herself into his chest. It should have disgusted her; Alex should feel shame and desire to rid herself of such a feeling, but she didn’t.The door to the bedroom swung open, and Elijah walked in holding a tray, dressed – like he always was – in slacks and a button-up shirt. What surprised Alex was the lack of shoes or tie. She pulled her lower lip into her mouth and squeezed her knees closer to her chest. Elijah offered her a warm smile as he placed the food at the foot of the bed.He said, “Good morning.”Alice returned the smile. “Hi.”“How are you feeling?” he asked. The concern Alex had seen the night before was still there.“I-um…” Alex tucked her hair behind her ear. She hadn’t been able to explain herself the night before, and she didn’t know if she wanted to.“Alex?” Elijah moved around the bed and sat on the edge. “What happened last night?”Alex looked away, not wanting to meet his eye. It felt strange that she was ashamed to admit what she had done to a vampire; Elijah had, no doubt, killed thousands of humans and witches in his very long life. Alex had no idea why she felt like him learning that she had killed a witch would bother him.“Did something happen to Elena?” he asked.Alex shook her head. “She’s safe.”Elijah reached out and laid his hand on top of hers. “Did something happen with Klaus? Did he hurt you?”Alex took Elijah’s hand. The burning between them as their hands met was like a jolt of life. It made Alex feel better, and she wanted more. But she just continued to hold his hand. “After we went our separate ways last night, I went home, and Klaus was there. He had a knife to Jenna’s throat. He wanted the moonstone.”Elijah frowned.Alex continued. “He mentioned you and your siblings. And then he mentioned that he’s been watching us. He saw us by the pond. I think he was just trying to throw us all off, but when he was distracted, I managed to get him away from Jenna and Elena, and we took a chance to kick him out of Alaric’s body.” She took a shaky breath. “I went upstairs to get what I needed, and when I came back, a witch working for Klaus showed up. We fort and I…won.” Tears flooded Alex’s eyes, and she tried to hold them in. “I killed the witch.”The tears broke, and Alex pressed her head into her knees. She felt the bed shift and Elijah’s body pressed against hers. His chest was against her side, and his arm slid around her legs to pull her close. One of his hands swept back her hair.“You did what you had to,” said Elijah.Alex sobbed. “I murdered someone.”“You were protecting your family,” he said.Alex lifted her head. “I could have kept them safe without killing him. I have so many options at my disposal, but I go straight for the easiest thing, and it ended up with him choking on his own blood.” A sob wracked through her.Elijah lifted Alex’s face, his hands cupping her cheeks, and he shook his head. “Alex, there is no way that you would kill someone in cold blood.” He wiped her tears and rested their forehead’s together. “Anyone who works with Klaus will do anything for him. There are no boundaries, no unnecessary risks, no step that is too far. If you hadn’t stopped that witch, any one of you could have died.”Alex sniffed and leant into Elijah’s touch. He pulled her closer in his embrace, and she buried her face into his chest.“I know it hurts. Taking someone’s life is never easy, but sometimes, it is kill or be killed.” Elijah’s hand rested on her back and let her mind work through what she needed.Alex curled her hand into Elijah’s shirt; the material was soft and clearly expensive, and she was making a mess all over it. She wanted to apologise for ruining his shirt. But as she sat there, pressed against Elijah, she thought back to everything Elena had been telling her since she had come back to Mystic Falls. Vampires were supposed to be monsters, void of any human emotion; there was no empathy, compassion, or love. But Elijah wasn’t like that; he wasn’t void of anything. He had gone out of his way to comfort her, to help her, when she had done nothing for him.“The first thought that crossed my mind when I realised what I had done was that I was no better than a vampire.” Alex pressed her face further into Elijah’s chest. “I thought there was nothing more monstrous than a beast that would take another’s life.”Elijah’s hands shifted to rub her shoulders. “I don’t know if I should take offence to that.”“I don’t mean you.” Alex lifted her head to look Elijah in the eye. She didn’t see him as a monster. He couldn’t be.Elijah smiled. “I understand why you would believe that vampires are void of emotion. We are beasts, yes, driven by hunger. Blood is our lifeforce; without it, we fall to our basic instincts. And while plenty of vampires in this world think they are above it all and want nothing but to cause pain and mayhem, not all of us do. As I told you, like every species, there are the good vampires, and there are the bad vampires.” He tucked a piece of hair behind her ear. “So, yes, we are beasts, but we are not void of emotion. In fact, as a vampire, I feel everything even more so than I was human. I have felt pure joy, deep love, intense passion, and it has been euphoric. But along with that, I have also felt the lowest depths of pain, loss, fear. These emotions drive us; they push us to do things that most humans or witches would never even consider.”Alex asked, “What does this have to do with me being a murderer?”Elijah sighed. “From our brief time together, I can see how protective you are of your family. How much you love them. That kind of devotion means that you would be willing to do anything to keep them safe, even sacrificing yourself.”“Are you calling me a vampire?”Elijah smiled; a small laugh followed. “Not quite. What I am trying to say is that we are all driven by instincts and emotions. What happened to that witch was you doing what you needed to; it wasn’t because you wanted to kill him.”Alex sighed. “I stilled killed him, though.”“Yes, you took his life, but by no fault of your own. If anyone is to blame in any of this is Niklaus. He pulled that witch into his war; he pulled you and Elena into this but spent the last thousand years slaughtering his way to what he wants most. You are just another victim.” Elijah cupped the sides of Alex’s neck.She said, “I don’t feel like a victim.”“It is normal to feel responsible, but you can’t blame yourself for circumstances you couldn’t control.”Alex nodded her head, understanding what Elijah was saying. She couldn’t stop the overwhelming weight of guilt that felt like it was crushing her, but Klaus had brought this all on them. Alex didn’t know if she could ever accept that what she had done was – not the right thing – but the best thing she could have done in that situation; her mind would probably always go back and think about what she could have done differently.As she sat pressed against Elijah, Alex’s stomach growled. She flushed with embarrassment.Elijah chuckled and said, “I did make you breakfast. It might be a little cold.”Alex pulled herself, reluctantly, away from his chest and looked at the tray of food at the foot of the bed. She saw a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon and toast. And there was also coffee and orange juice. Alex smiled and reached for a piece of bacon; it was cold but crispy as she bit into it. “I like cold bacon,” she said.Elijah smiled. “What about cold coffee?”Alex shrugged. “It’s not the worst in the world.”Elijah shifted on the bed so he didn’t knock into her as he stood. “I’ll go make you a fresh cup. I’ll be right back.”Alex wanted to tell him to stay, but she stayed silent as she watched him walk out of the room. And she couldn’t help but watch the way he walked, her eyes falling to his but. Alex snapped out of her daze, and she frowned at herself. What the fuck! She couldn’t seriously be that messed up that she was attracted to Elijah. But she was. The burning sensations of every touch was like a drug, and even now, after she had calmed down, she wanted Elijah to hold her again. And then there had been the incident by the pond; if her phone hadn’t rung, Alex knew that she would have let him kiss her. That alone should have worried her or at least repulsed her, but it didn’t.What had happened to the firm belief that vampires were the enemy? When Alex thought of Stefan and Damon, Klaus, all of them were monsters. Beasts that needed to be destroyed. But not Elijah. Mikael’s words the night before had worried her. Alex didn’t want to face the thought that Elijah would turn against her, that he would choose Klaus. She didn’t want to be against him.Alex pulled the breakfast tray onto the bed and was eating her eggs when Elijah walked back in. He had a steaming cup of coffee in his hands, and he placed it down on the tray. Alex thanked him before picking it up and taking a sip; the flavour was rich and creamy, and it surprised her.“Nice?” asked Elijah, a small knowing smile on his lips.“Yeah, it’s really good,” said Alex.“It’s one of my favourites. I get the beans straight from Italy.” Elijah moved over to take a seat on the chair that sat by the window.Alex frowned when he didn’t sit beside her on the bed again before shaking her head at her own crazy thoughts. She finished her food before shifting to hang her legs over the edge of the bed. Alex pushed the blankets off and paused at her bare legs. All she had on was her underwear and a tank top.Elijah noticed her face and said, “Your clothes were covered in mud. I had my housekeeper remove them and wash them for you.”Alex didn’t know if she was comforted that someone else had stripped her clothes; the idea of Elijah doing it wasn’t so bad. But she liked the careful thought he had taken. She cleared her throat. “Thank you.”“Mary will bring them to you once they are done,” he said.Alex nodded, then asked, “And is Mary aware of what she is doing?” She couldn’t help but be curious. After all, it wasn’t uncommon for vampires to use humans as slaves. They used their compulsion to have them serve their every need. It shouldn’t surprise Alex if Elijah was to admit that he had compelled her.Elijah nodded his head slowly. “Mary does everything because she is asked, not because I compel her to do so. She is paid a more than suitable wage for the maintenance she does on this home. And that isn’t to say I haven’t compelled her; after all, I wouldn’t want her to open the fridge and then tell everyone about the blood bags she found inside.”Alex found that his explanation was understandable. “I take it the deed is also in her name.”Elijah smiled. “Yes. I wouldn’t want any unwelcome visitors into my home.”Alex stared at Elijah; he was different than she had ever imagined. The stories that swirled circled about the Original vampires were vast. They were also about death and blood; they detailed the savagery of vampires. Elijah was said to be the calm and collected Original brother, Klaus’ right hand. While Klaus was the chaos, Elijah was the one who really controlled things. But there was no mention of the gentle hand, the kind gestures, the warm smile. She had expected a ruthless and cunning vampire that saw nothing past the advantage that you could give him.“See something you like?” asked Elijah.Alex blinked. She hadn’t meant to stare at him for so long. “You weren’t what I expected.” Alex held his eyes as she stood from the bed and moved towards the window.Elijah said, “Yes, I suppose the reality never really does live up to the legend.”Alex looked out the window at the view. It seemed to be a large lawn adorned with rose bushes and hedging. There was a large tree sitting on one side, and below it was a small bench. She glanced to the side to look at Elijah and said, “I would say you are better than the stories.”The corner of Elijah’s mouth quirked up, a pleased yet interested smirk taking hold. “Is that so?”“Yes.” Alex felt a pleased smile fill her face as she noticed Elijah’s eyes. They flicked down to admire her legs before slowly gazing up her body to look at her face. Alex wasn’t exactly shy about her body, but she stood half-naked in front of someone she didn’t really know. “I didn’t think I could look at a vampire and consider them kind.”Elijah said, “Not many would think like you.”Alex asked, “Because they hold the same view as I did or because you were never kind to them?”“Both.” Elijah pushed himself up from the chair and crossed the small distance to stand behind her. He placed his lips close enough to her ear that she felt his breath as he spoke. “I’m not one to let my guard down.”Alex felt the goosebumps break out across her arms as her heart leapt in her chest. “Neither am I.”Elijah’s hand came up to touch her shoulder; his knuckles tenderly touched the bare skin. The subtle contact made Alex swallow and lick her lips.“There is something about you,” he said. His voice was soft. “Being around you makes me feel things I haven’t felt in a very long time.”Alex turned around to face him. Elijah’s hand moved over her collarbone and across her neck. His fingers cupped the back of her throat, and turned her head up to look at him. Elijah wasn’t smiling, but the way he was looking at Alex made her heart race.“Alexandra?”“Yes?” she said. Her tongue ran across her suddenly dry lips. She knew what Elijah’s next words would be, and she knew what her answer would be. And it suddenly didn’t matter that she should hate him or that she shouldn’t be doing such a thing for so many reasons. But she needed it.“Can I ki—”Alex didn’t allow him to finish. She pressed herself up using her toes and pressed her lips to his. They both seemed frozen, just for a moment as they kissed. Elijah’s lips were soft against hers, and his hand was still caressing her neck. But when the moment passed, Elijah pressed down. His lips moved against hers, and his fingers tightened around the back of her neck as his other hand wound around her waist, pulling her body into his, lifting her, so only the tip of her toes was just on the ground. Alex moaned into the kiss, her mouth parting to breathe for air, but Elijah pressed his tongue inside.Alex couldn’t process anything but the taste of Elijah on her touch. She could feel the burn of his hands on her skin, the way his hand slipped beneath the back of her top to cup the curve in her back and press her body against his. Alex lifted her hands to grasp his face, her hands holding either side of his face, trying to keep him from pulling back.And then they were moving. Alex felt the world shift, and her back was being pressed into the soft mattress. Elijah let out a deep groan that trembled through her body as he sunk between her thighs and pressed his lower body into hers. Alex used her thighs to cradle Elijah’s waist, one of her hands sliding around his side to grasp at his white shirt.Every nerve in Alex’s body was screaming, her stomach was twisting, and her centre was burning with the need for something. Alex shifted her hips up, pressing herself against him, her back arching and pressing her breasts into his chest. Elijah grunted at the contact, and one of his hands slid down her side to cup her thigh and wrap it around his hip as he pressed back. Alex felt the pressure of his hardening cock against her core. Their bodies were separated by his pants and her underwear, but his hips rocked against her hard enough to send a wave of pleasure all the way to the tips of her fingers, making her whimper into his mouth.Elijah broke the kiss, his mouth moving from his lips to press against her chin and then her throat. Alex gasped for breath, her head spinning as she swallowed the much-needed oxygen. Their hips rocked together, the small shocks of pleasure flowing through her as their bodies found a comfortable rhythm. She felt Elijah’s teeth nip at her skin, his lips suck and kiss along the flesh, and it made her moan.Alex knew – logically – she should be scared. A vampire had his mouth at her throat, and at any second, he could bite down and tear into her artery. But she wasn’t. Alex had never felt so alive. Every inch of her was screaming yes, and she didn’t want it to end.Elijah’s mouth had moved down her throat to her chest, his lips tracing the tops of her breasts as his hand pulled the straps of her tank top as well as her bra. Alex’s head fell back, and her back arched as Elijah pulled her top down low enough for his lips to taste her breast. His tongue ran beneath the lace material to twirl around her nipple, which hardened under his attention. Alex cried out, a loud moan filling the room as Elijah nibbled at the small pink nub.Alex grasped at Elijah’s hair; she wanted to feel his mouth on hers. As she lifted her head, Alex pulled him from her breast and groaned as she kissed him. They panted against each other’s mouth, their tongues mashed together, and Alex’s body trembled as Elijah’s hip moved against hers harder.“Elijah.” His name was a gasp of breath from her lips as her stomach twisted. She was close, so very close, and she wanted it.“Alexandra.” Elijah’s thrust his hips against her, his fingers digging into her thigh, her heel pressing into his ass. Alex felt the string inside her snap, and she fell apart.The world around her seemed to disappear; her vision turned black, and all she could feel was this overwhelming sense of bliss. It took a moment for Alex to come back; her breaths were uneven, her heart was hammering, and she was lying beneath Elijah, whose lips were still lavishing her neck.Alex stared at the ceiling, and everything sunk in. Overwhelming regret flooded through her, and tears gathered in Alex’s eyes. A sob came out of her throat, and Elijah’s head snapped up.He cupped her cheek and asked, “What is it?”Alex shook her head and pressed her hands against his shoulders. Elijah didn’t fight her; he moved off her and allowed her to climb off the bed. Alex pulled herself from his embrace and walked to the door that was just to her right. It led her into a bathroom. Alex closed the door behind her, and she pressed her back against it.“Alex?” Elijah’s voice was filled with concern as it came through the door.She couldn’t find it in her to respond.“Alex, please. What is it?” he asked.Alex shook her head and sunk to the ground. She pulled her knees to her chest and let her tears fall. She couldn’t believe what she had done. Not only had she kissed Elijah, but she had let him touch her body and given her an orgasm without even having sex. Instead, like an animal, she had humped herself against him. And it wasn’t just that he was a vampire, one of the original of a species she was supposed to hate, but she had cheated on James. The man she was supposed to love. How was she supposed to face him?Elijah sighed from the other side and said, “I’m sorry.”Alex’s sobbed as she heard his voice. He sounded hurt. Alex shook her head; what was she doing?
  
    Chapter Text
    The thoughts in her mind were racing. Everything felt conflicted, and she didn’t know what to listen to. Alex didn’t know if she wanted to cry or laugh. Did she hate Elijah or crave more of him? Would everyone hate her because of her choices? It all ran through her mind, and she just wanted it to stop. But it wouldn’t.Alex could still feel the burn of Elijah’s hands on her skin, the taste of his tongue, the way his firm body was pressed against hers, and it made her hot. She was turned on just by the thought of him, and knowing he was just outside the door made her body want him. And that desire made her hate herself. James was the man she loved, the person she was supposed to desire and crave, but not anymore. From the moment Alex first felt that attraction to Elijah, he had clouded every one of her senses. Alex had let herself forget who she was and had given in to her desires, and now she wanted nothing but to take them back.Alex had pulled herself off the floor to splash some water on her face. Her cheeks were red, her appearance ruffled, and she had to fix her bra. Alex had quivered when she noticed the marks on her skin. Her breast, the one Elijah had sucked and nibbled, was covered it small marks. As was her shoulder. Alex clenched the sink as her body flushed at the memory of his mouth on her. She squeezed her thighs together and glared at herself in the mirror. She didn’t know the person before her, not this weak-willed horny woman who wanted to be defiled by a vampire of all things. She had to get out of there.The knock on the door made Alex jump. She clenched the sink as she spun to face the door and frowned when the voice she heard wasn’t Elijah.“Miss Alexandra? Mr Mikealson asked me to bring you your things. I’ve left them on the bed for you when you are ready, along with your phone and car keys.”Alex swallowed. “Thank you.”She heard a shuffle of steps and then the clicking of another door. It had to be the housekeeper Elijah had mentioned, Mary. And if he had asked Mary to bring up her things, then he wasn’t in the bedroom anymore.Alex pushed away from the sink and opened the door. The bedroom was void of Elijah, and as Mary said, her pants and jack and boots were sitting on the bed. Alex reached for her pants and pulled them on, noticing the messed bed sheets and the damp patch in the centre. She paused and swallowed, her heart thumping again. Alex shook her head and finished getting dressed before grabbing her phone. It was low on battery, but enough it should survive until she got home. There was only one message, and that was from Elena. Please come home soon. Alex slipped her phone into her back pocket and grabbed her keys. She needed to leave.The door out of the bedroom led to a hallway that had a few other doors, all of them were closed as Alex passed, and she stopped as she came to a landing. Alex headed down the stairs and felt relief when she saw the front door. As she pulled it open and saw her car waiting, Alex heard her name.“Alexandra?” It was Elijah.Alex ran for her car, which was stupid considering Elijah could easily beat her, but it didn’t stop her. As Alex started her car, she looked up to see Elijah standing in the doorway; confusion filled his face. Alex found herself staring at him for a moment. Should she really just leave? What had happened wasn’t exactly his fault; Alex had been the one to kiss him first, she could have asked him to stop at any moment, but she hadn’t. Alex felt a new layer of guilt about Elijah; she felt like she was hurting him.Squeezing her eyes shut, Alex held back more tears that wanted to fall. The desire to run back to him weighed heavily, but she couldn’t give in to it.Alex pulled away from Elijah’s home. Glancing back in her rearview mirror as she headed down the drive, she saw Elijah watch her drive away, and she hated herself even more. *** The house was quiet when Alex got home, and for that, Alex was grateful. She climbs the stairs and strips her clothes, throwing everything into the corner of her room before getting into the shower. Alex stands under the hot spray and washes her hair, and then scrubs her body. When she’s done, Alex dries her hair and dresses in a pair of skinny jeans and an oversized graphic tee before sitting on her bed.In the last twenty-four hours, she had faced Klaus for the first time, told Elena about the Council, saved Jenna from Klaus, attempted to kick him from Alaric’s body, killed another witch in self-defence, run away from her family, slept in Elijah’s bed, kissed Elijah, humped Elijah, and then ran away from him. And Alex felt broken.Staring at her hands, Alex didn’t know what she believed anymore. Things had been so straightforward before she came back to Mystic Falls. She believed in what the Council wanted, she was in love with James, and those she loved were safe. And now, she had no idea. Alex had learned that the Council had been keeping things about her family from her, and she couldn’t help but wonder what else Renee had never shared. Alex had no idea if she still loved James or how she felt about Elijah. And she was struggling to keep everyone safe. Elena’s life was constantly in danger, and that wouldn’t end until Klaus was dead. Or Elena was.The front door downstairs opened and slammed shut.“Alex?” called Elena.Footsteps hit the stairs, and Elena appeared in Alex’s doorway. Alex lifted her head and offered a strained smile. Elena looked relieved and crossed the room to sit down on the bed beside her. “We were so worried about you.” Elena pulled Alex into a hug.“I’m sorry,” said Alex. She leant into Elena’s hug. “I just needed to be alone.”Elena frowned. “Why did you take off?”Alex’s voice shook. “I killed someone.”“The guy that was helping Klaus?” asked Elena.Alex nodded. “Yeah.”“But he was trying to kill us.”Alex shrugged and clenched her brow. “So? Someone deserves to die because they think we are the threat? We have no idea why he was working for Klaus. He could have been as innocent as you.”Elena said, “He made his decision when he stood beside Klaus. You kept us safe. If you hadn’t stopped him, he could have hurt James or Stefan, even you.”Alex pulled away from Elena and stood. She didn’t want to have this argument again. “I still took a life.”Elena looked at Alex like she didn’t understand. There seemed to be so many questions on her face, but she didn’t say anything.“What?” asked Alex.Elena sighed and stood. “I thought that you killed vampires all the time.”“What?” Alex frowned. She didn’t know if she was misunderstanding Elena.“This might sound bad, but I don’t see how you killing vampires is different from what happened with that witch.”Alex’s mouth popped open. “Seriously?”“Yeah.” Elena crossed her arms.“They are vampires, Elena! Not people!”“That is where you’re wrong.”“No!”“Yes!” Elena snapped. “I understand that your experience with vampires has been bad. I’ve seen some of the worst things imaginable because of vampires. But not every vampire is a soulless monster. Stefan is the most caring and selfless person I’ve ever met. He will do anything for those he loves, he would do anything for Damon or for me. Even though Damon is the biggest pain in the ass I have ever known, he too is protective, and his heart is bigger than he lets anyone see. Even Elijah. He has an alternative motive, but he has kept her word.”Alex felt her stomach twist at the mention of Elijah.“Vampires feel everything just like we do. And like everything else on this planet, there are good ones and bad ones. You can’t judge a whole group based on a small portion.”“So what you’re saying is that I’m the monster. I’m the cruel witch that slays innocent vampires with discrimination.” Alex stepped back and sat down on the window seat, and she let out a mocking laugh. “Maybe you should shove a stake in my heart. Then everyone can be rid of me. Just another monster that no one will miss.”Elena’s arms dropped, and she walked over to Alex. She knelt and placed her hands on Alex’s knees. “That’s not what I’m saying.”“Could’ve fooled me.”Elena grasped Alex’s wrists. “You are not a monster. I would say you’ve been misinformed by this council of yours. Then again, it’s no different from the town council; they think they know better too.” She sighed. “What happened last night is not something any of us wanted. That witch shouldn’t have lost his life, and while it’s regrettable, we can’t change what happened. You…can’t change what has happened.” Elena rubbed Alex’s forearm. “But you can try and make sure that it doesn’t happen again. If we find ourselves in the same situation again, we try and make things happen differently.”Alex looked at Elena. She sounded like the older sister, and it made Alex frown. Elena had to be the older sister for Jeremy after she had taken off. It was another thing she had messed up. Alex had abandoned her family when they needed her. But it seemed that Elena had found her own strength, a way to accept that you couldn’t control everything or change your mistakes.“I know it’s easier to look at vampires and think they are all the same. But I promise you, they aren’t.” Elena dropped her head and leaned her head on Alex’s hands.Alex hadn’t the thought, but she couldn’t ignore it. Maybe she was wrong, maybe Stefan was one of the good ones. The Council could be wrong, Alex could have been misled, and she had spent the last few years not really understanding the consequences of her actions.“I’m sorry,” said Alex.Elena looked up.“I should have told you the truth when I first came back.”Elena pulled herself up onto the window seat.“I’ve known you were the doppelganger for a while, and I thought that if I could keep you hidden and remove every supernatural trace in your life, Klaus would never find you. I thought that I would find a way to kill him, and you could live your life in blissful ignorance.” Alex sighed.Elena smiled at Alex, her hand still squeezing Alex’s. “Does this mean you will give Stefan a chance?”Alex frowned; she didn’t know. “No more lies.”Elena nodded.“I don’t know. But I won’t try and kill him.”Elena laughed. “Well, I’m sure he will be relieved.”Alex leant her head on Elena’s shoulder. “I’m sorry I’m a sucky sister.”Elena leant her head against Alex’s. “I don’t think so. Older sisters are supposed to be a pain. They threaten boyfriends, protect their siblings at all cost.”Alex smiled. “You’re a pretty great sister yourself.”“Jeremy would disagree.”Alex cringed. “Yeah, I think we are due some serious sibling time.”“That’s if we can separate him and Bonnie.” Elena huffed.Alex smirked. “I think they’re cute together.”Elena shook her head. “I’m just glad they are happy.”They fell silent for a moment, and Alex closed her eyes. She still felt heavy with emotions. Guilt being the heaviest of them all. And while she was still uncertain about everything, Alex knew what she needed to do. Klaus was the threat, and regardless of how she felt about vampires, witches, the Council, James or Elijah, she had to focus on stopping him and keeping Elena safe.“Speaking of Bonnie, I found something that couple help,” said Alex.Elena seemed surprised. “Something to stop Klaus?”Alex nodded. “Yeah. Speaking off, what happened last night after I left?”“Klaus disappeared. He was gone by the time James woke up. And no one has seen him, or Alaric, since,” said Elena.Alex ran her fingers through her hair. “Alright. First, call Bonnie and see if we can meet up with her. It seems that her mum, Abby, may have a spell we can use to stop Klaus.”“Her mum?” Elena looked shocked.Alex nodded. “Apparently, Abby was the one who desiccated Mikael.”“And you think you can do the same to Klaus?”“Maybe. I know he won’t be dead, but if we can keep him down, then we have more time to find a way to actually kill him.”“Wow, yeah, okay.” Elena pulled out her phone. “And what’s the next thing?”“Well, we need to find Klaus and Alaric. If Klaus is still in Alaric’s body, then we might be able to find Klaus’ body and desiccate him before we kick Klaus from Alaric. Or alternatively, if Mikael can find Klaus’ body, he can stake him and kill him,” explained Alex.Elena smiled. “You think we can actually stop him?”Alex nodded. “I do. But we need to be careful of Mikael.”Elena asked, “I thought he wanted what we wanted.”“Yes, but…” Alex stopped. Elena had enough people threatening to kill her; did she need another.“But what?”Alex closed her eyes and sighed. “Mikael told me – well, he threatened me – that if he failed to kill Klaus, he would stop him from breaking his curse by killing you.”The fear that flashed in Elena’s eyes made Alex wish she hadn’t said anything.“But he won’t get near you. And I think we only need to be really concerned if we get down to it, and Mikael has no other choice.” Alex squeezed Elena’s hand.Elena nodded and smiled.It wasn’t an ideal situation. Alex had woken Mikael thinking he would kill Klaus and thought maybe he would take down a few other vampires. What she had forgotten about was the fact that he didn’t care about human life; he only cared about getting what he wanted.
  
    Chapter Text
    Bonnie agreed to meet Elena and Alex at the Grill. As they drove over, Alex sent James a text message – not being able to bring herself to call him – and explained the plan. She had let out an internal groan of relief when James had responded with a simple ‘got it’ and hadn’t tried to call her. There was a conversation they needed to have, and Alex knew she wasn’t ready for that yet. And while it wasn’t fair what Alex had done, she wanted to explain herself to James, which meant knowing how she felt. And since she had no idea what to think about James or Elijah, she would focus on what she did know.The Grill wasn’t overly busy when Elena and Alex walked in. Bonnie was sitting at a booth on her own, smiling brightly as she typed on her phone. They crossed the room to join her, and as they sat down, Bonnie asked, “Hey, what was with the urgent meetup?”Alex had agreed to let Elena explain it. Alex knew that Bonnie’s mother had left without a word, but according to Elena, it was a delicate subject with her best friend. Alex agreed it would be easier to hear from someone who Bonnie loved that they would need to track down the woman that abandoned her.“Alex found a way we could stop Klaus,” said Elena.Bonnie’s eyes widened. “Seriously?”Alex nodded. “Yep. It won’t kill him, but it will stop him.”“Okay?”Elena sighed. “Alex wants to desiccate him.”Bonnie said, “Isn’t that what happened to Mikael?”“Yeah. A witch used a spell to dry up every ounce of blood in his body instantly. He starved within seconds. If we do that to Klaus, he would be nothing by a dried corpse, essentially,” explained Alex.“So you would have the time to find a way to kill him?” said Bonnie.“Yeah. Mikael could stake him, or if for any reason that becomes impossible, we can look for another way,” said Alex.“Alright, I’m in. What do you need from me?” she asked.Elena shifted in her seat awkwardly. She said, “We need your help to find the spell.”“I don’t have any books that have something like that.”“No, the spell isn’t in a book. Alex spoke to Mikael, and the witch that desiccated him was your mum.” Elena looked like she was in physical pain as she finished.Bonnie’s face dropped. Her jaw clenched, and her eyes drooped. Alex had never seen her look so broken before. She swallowed and looked down at her lap.“Are you okay?” asked Elena.Bonnie nodded. “Yeah.”Alex said, “I only need your blood to locate her. You don’t have to come with me to get the spell.”Bonnie grabbed her phone and unlocked it. She said, “You don’t need my blood.”Alex and Elena glanced at each other and frowned.“Once I learned how to do a locator spell, I tried it to see if I could find her.” Bonnie placed her phone on the table and slid it across to Alex. “She’s in North Carolina.”Elena reached out her hand to comfort Bonnie.“She stayed close to where she put Mikael,” said Alex. “Makes sense. If she put him down, she’d want to keep a close eye to make sure he didn’t get woken up.”“So then why did she let you wake him up?” asked Elena.Alex shrugged. “She might not have realised until it was too late. Or something could have happened to her magic.”Bonnie fidgeted in her seat. “Are you going to go see her?”Alex nodded. “I need to ask her about the spell, get all the specifics that I can.”“I want to come with you.”Alex wasn’t going to say no, but the look on Bonnie’s face worried her. She couldn’t imagine what it would have been like to be abandoned by a parent, but the reality of their situation is that they didn’t have time for a messy reunion.“Are you sure?” asked Elena.Bonnie nodded. “I need to see her.”Alex handed Bonnie back her phone and said, “We need to go sooner rather than later.”“Okay, I’m ready when you are.”Alex stood and said, “I need to make a few phone calls before we leave. I’ll be right back.” She left Elena and Bonnie at the table and walked outside. She needed to tell James where she was going as well as Jenna. Alex dialled Jenna’s number first.“Alex? Are you okay?” answered Jenna.Alex sighed, remembering she hadn’t spoken to anyone other than Elena since last night. “Yeah, I’m fine. I’m with Elena and Bonnie.”“Oh, thank god. We were so worried,” she exclaimed.“I’m sorry, I just needed to be alone.” Alex moved down the footpath, stopping near the alley behind the Grill. “I wanted to let you know that Elena and I are taking Bonnie to North Carolina.”“What? Why?”“Bonnie’s mum might have a spell we can use on Klaus,” she explained.“And you’re leaving now?”“Yeah. Just wanted to tell you, so you don’t worry.”Jenna let out a huffed laugh. “At this point, I’m always worried.”Alex smiled softly. “I know how you feel.”“Well, be careful.”“We will. I’ll let you know when we are on our way back.”Talking to Jenna had been easy, and now she had to call James. Alex stared at her phone for a moment; she was scared to dial the number. She leaned back against the brick wall and groaned. She just had to tell him she was going to North Carolina; everything else could wait.“Alex!”Shoving away from the wall, wide-eyed. Alex turned to see Alaric standing there. He looked confused and was holding himself up by grasping at the dumpster beside him. Alex frowned as she looked at the mess of a man before her; this wasn’t Klaus.“Alaric?”Alaric nodded. “I don’t know what’s going on.” He pushed away from the dumpster and stumbled a few steps before dropping to his knees.Alex rushed over to him and knelt before him. “Hey, take it easy.”Alaric looked up; he was struggling to catch his breath. “Alex, what happened to me?”“What do you remember?”“I was walking out of my apartment. I was going to head to school to get some things done and then nothing. I woke up lying on the floor in my apartment a few hours ago, and I could barely move.” He coughed. “I tried to find my phone or my laptop, but they weren’t in my apartment.”Alex grasped Alaric’s shoulders and helped him to find his feet. “I’m afraid you were Klaus’ first victim.”Alaric frowned. “What?”Alex explained. “We discovered that Klaus likes to possess humans. It’s like a party trick.”“He possessed me?”“Yeah. He had a witch put his soul inside your body. He had complete control.”“What happened to me?”“I suppose you could think of it like you had a long nap.”“Then why do I feel like shit?” Alaric groaned.“Well, Klaus isn’t human. The human body would only be able to contain such a soul for so long without suffering damage.”Alaric’s head snapped up. “Damage? Like what?”“I don’t know; you’re the first person I’ve ever seen possessed.”“Great.” Alaric groaned. “How long was he in me for?”Alex shrugged. “I have no idea. But he made sure to play his role, infiltrated the group, then got bored and tried to kill everyone.”Alaric’s eyes widened. “Is Jenna okay? Elena? Jeremy?”“They are fine,” she assured him.He nodded. “Good, that’s good.” Alaric stumbled, and Alex pushed him back towards the wall so he could lean against it. “Wait, he can’t possess me again, can he?”Alex squeezed his shoulder and cringed. “Technically, he can. But I can keep him out. I just don’t have the stuff to do it.”“Right, well. When you have the time, I would appreciate it.”She nodded. “No problem. However, I think you’re safe. His little secret got out, so there’s no use in jumping back in you again.”Alaric sighed. “I suppose that is comforting.”Alex’s phone buzzed. She looked down at it and saw a message from Elena. Where’d you go? Alex looked back to Alaric. “Look, let’s get you back to the house, and I’ll call Jenna. Elena and I need to hit the road to get this spell.”Alaric nodded. “Sounds good.” He pushed away from the wall and stumbled a few steps.Alex felt the twisting of her gut and the hairs on her skin stand up as she watched Alaric’s neck twist awkwardly all the way around, followed by a loud snap. Alaric dropped to the ground before Mikael, who had a small look of enjoyment on his face. Alex looked at the slumped body of Alaric before glaring at Mikael. She threw back her hand, throwing Mikael down the alleyway.Mikael laughed as he jumped back up.“What the hell is wrong with you?” she yelled.Mikael straightened his jacket. “You really believe Klaus just vacated the body of that human? He could have been playing you.”Alex clenched her hands. “That wasn’t Klaus. Your son couldn’t stomach pretending to need help. You just killed an innocent man.”Mikael shrugged. “Collateral damage.”“You’ll regret this.”Mikael sighed. “Little witch, I told you last night, I will get what I want. Even if I have to kill every last human involved in Elena’s life. I will use Elena to draw Klaus out and then kill her before his eyes, and I will enjoy it. Watching her life fade and also watching that half-breed break as he comes to face his failure.”Alex moved to attack Mikael, but he took off, leaving Alex with Alaric’s body. She took a shaky breath before kneeling down to look at Alaric. What was she going to tell Elena? And what about Jenna?“Alex? You out here?”Elena’s voice caught her ears, but she didn’t turn.“Alex?...Oh my god!” Elena rushed into the alley and dropped beside her. “Alaric? Alex, what happened?”“Mikael happened,” she said.Elena grasped for Alaric’s arm; she pulled at his hand and then let out a sigh of relief. Alex looked at her sister, confused.“It’s okay,” said Elena.“How is this okay? Alaric is dead.”Elena held up Alaric’s hand. “His ring.”Alex stared at her.“The Gilbert family have two rings; they have been passed down through the generations. Our dad had one, as did John. The rings protect humans from a supernatural death.”“Wait, so Alaric’s not dead?”“Yes, but the ring brings him back. I don’t really understand it myself.”Alex frowned. That didn’t sound good. A ring that did that could cause all sorts of damage. Ripping a soul back and forth between life and death could have unforeseen consequences. “How did Alaric get a ring if they are Gilbert rings?”“Isobel,” said Elena. “John gave it to her, and then she gave it to Alaric. Jeremy wears dad’s ring.”Alex stood and stared down at Alaric’s body. “How long till he wakes up?”Elena shrugged. “It’s not really a set thing.”Rubbing the back of her neck, she said, “Alright. Call Stefan and have him take Alaric back to the house. Once Stefan picks him up, we need to hit the road, and I think I’ll need that spell for more than just Klaus.”Elena nodded and pulled out her phone.It seemed that perhaps Alex should have listened to Stefan in the first place. They should have left Mikael in the tomb and found another way; he was just causing more harm than good. Alex lifted up her phone and dialled James; she still needed to update him and warn him about Mikael.“I’m glad you called,” answered James.“I’m sorry about last night,” she said.“It’s okay. I understand that you probably hate what happened last night, but it was an accident.”“I know.”“And the witch was a traitor. He was working with Klaus.”“I know.”“Are you okay?”“Not really, but I don’t have any more time to fall apart.”“Where did you go last night? I waited at the house, but you never came back.”Alex froze. She couldn’t tell him, not over the phone. “I will explain, but not now. Listen, Bonnie knows where her mother is. Bonnie, Elena and I are going to go and see her and get the desiccation spell she used on Mikael.”“Okay, great. I’ll keep an eye on everyone while your gone,” he said.“Thanks. Also, I need you to be careful of Mikael.”“Always, but why in particular? Isn’t he working with us?” he asked.“Mikael has made it clear that he will kill Klaus, but he will kill whoever he needs to in the process. He’s threatened Elena, and he just killed Alaric right in front of me,” she explained.“Fuck. Maybe we should have left him in that tomb.”Alex clenched her jaw. They really should have. “Did you need me to deal with Alaric’s body?”“No, apparently, he wears some magic-infused ring that brings the dead back to life.”“What—”“It’s a whole story, I will explain later. For now, if you could just keep an eye and let me know if anything happens, I would appreciate it.”“Of course. Drive safe. I love you.”The words were like three shots to Alex’s chest. “Yeah, you too.” Alex hung up the phone and swallowed down the tears that wanted to break out. She looked to Elena, who was still kneeling beside Alaric but was always talking on the phone. They had things to do; her life could fall apart later.
  
    Chapter Text
    The drive from Mystic Falls to North Carolina is tense. Alex drove the whole way with Elena beside her and Bonnie in the back seat. Bonnie didn’t say much, but she couldn’t sit still. Her restless movements had slowly started to aggravate Alex, but she had clenched her jaw to keep herself from snapping at the young witch; Bonnie had every reason to be uncomfortable. Elena was also restless, but not in the same way. She was anxious about Bonnie. She constantly kept glancing over her shoulder to look at Bonnie, who was either staring at her phone or out the window.The anxious energy had Alex almost leaping from the car as they pulled up to the address that Bonnie had tracked Abby too. It was a small farmhouse surrounded by empty fields. There was a blooming garden and tall trees around the immediate vicinity, and there seemed to be a large shed out the back. Alex couldn’t sense any strange magic; it made her wonder if perhaps Bonnie’s mum wasn’t home.Bonnie climbed out of the car and wrapped her arms around herself as she headed towards the front door. Elena was close behind her, her worried eyes focused on Bonnie more than taking in their surroundings. Alex followed them after a moment, and as she stepped up onto the porch, Bonnie knocked on the door. Silent greeted them for a few seconds before Bonnie turned away from the door. She said, “No one’s home, guess we will have to look somewhere else.”Alex cut off her escape path to the door. “We don’t have the time to look anywhere else.”Bonnie frowned.The door behind them creaked open, and Bonnie stiffened. Out stepped an older version of Bonnie. She had long dark curls and almond coloured eyes; she was dressed brightly in a blue and white patterned dress. She was smiling before her eyes landed on Bonnie.“Oh my god,” she said. “Bonnie?”Bonnie swallowed. “Yeah, hi.”“What are you doing here?” she asked.Bonnie glanced at Elena, the panic in her eyes only growing. Alex stepped around Bonnie and said, “Hi, I’m Alex.”“Alexandra Gilbert?” she asked.Alex nodded. “I take it your Abby Bennett?”Abby said, “It’s Wilson, actually. Abby Wilson.”Bonnie frowned. “You changed your name?”Abby smiled tightly. “Why don’t you all come inside? I’ll make some tea.”Alex stepped in first and took in the home. As her eyes scanned over the small living room, she noticed the lack of anything that a practising witch would have. She saw no traces of herbs or grimoires, no crystals. There were a few burning candles, but they looked like they were only meant for their scent.Bonnie and Elena walked into Abby’s home and followed her into the kitchen. They sat down at a small round dining table while Abby walked over to the stove and put the kettle on. Alex stepped into the kitchen to join them, and she felt Abby’s eyes on her. Instead of taking a seat, like Bonnie and Elena had, Alex stepped to the side and leaned against the wall.“You have a lovely home,” said Elena.Alex smiled. Elena, always the nicest of them all.Abby pulled a few cups from the cupboard and smiled warmly. “You’re so sweet. Just like your mum.”“You knew my mum?”“Miranda was my best friend.”“You had a daughter and a best friend, and you still left?”Abby’s smile cracks, the hurt evident on her face. “My best friend is why I left.” She placed tea bags in each cup. “Fifteen years ago, a vampire came to town. Looking for you, Elena.” Abby turned to look at her. “Looking for the doppelganger. But no one could kill him. So I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him in a crypt in Charlotte.”Alex said, “Yes, Mikael. We’ve met.”Abby frowned. “Met? He’s awake?”“Yes.”Abby’s face clenched, and she seemed disturbed. The kettle whistled, and she took it off the stove to fill the cups. “Who would have let him out?”Alex glanced at Elena and Bonnie; they both seemed to be avoiding looking in her direction.“Him being awake isn’t the problem,” said Bonnie, “and it’s not why we’re here.”Abby picked up a tea and placed it on the table in front of Bonnie. “Why are you here?” She moved back to grab another tea and passed it to Elena before looking at Alex, who refused the tea.“The desiccation spell you used on Mikael,” said Alex. “I—we need it.”“For what?” she asked.“Klaus wants Elena so he can break The Sun and The Moon Curse,” explained Alex. “I want to desiccate Klaus before he has a chance.”“Wait, you’re a witch?” asked Abby.“I am,” said Alex. “My biological mother was a witch.”“You must have been a handful for Miranda,” she said sadly.Alex said, “The spell?”Abby frowned. “That spell took every ounce of power I had. It almost killed me.”“I’m willing to take the risk.”“Are you willing to risk your magic?”Alex looked at her unconcerned.“I recovered from that spell, but my magic didn’t. My powers never came back.”“And neither did you,” sneered Bonnie.“It wasn’t that simple,” claimed Abby.Bonnie scoffed. “It wasn’t? You cast a spell, put Mikael down, and then what? You decided that it was too much of a hassle to come back to your family?”“Bonnie…” tried Elena.“This was a mistake.” Bonnie stood from the table. “She is useless.” She turned and walked back towards the front door.Elena stood and chased after her. “Bonnie, wait.”Alex watched them go before turning back to Abby. “I want that spell.”“I’m not giving it to you.”Alex pushed away from the wall. “Yes, you are.”Abby shook her head. “No. That spell is dark magic, something that once you tap into changes everything.”Alex stepped closer to her and said, “I’m not naive, Abby. My magic isn’t as light as I would like, but I know how to control it and myself. And I need that spell to save Elena. Klaus is going to kill her if I don’t put him down, and if it kills me, then so be it, but I would rather risk my own life than Elena’s.”Abby held her tea in her hands.“You can either give me the spell, or I will pull it from your mind on my own.”Abby’s face darkened, but she nodded. “Alright, fine. I will write down what you need to know.” She stepped out of the room, leaving Alex alone.Alex knew it was probably harsh to threaten the woman; after all, she hadn’t done anything to her, but there was no time for the back and forth crap. Alex wanted the spell so she could stop Klaus and stop Mikael.She stepped out of the kitchen and outside onto the back deck. It faced the shed that she had noticed from the drive earlier, but she could also see a vast garden. As Alex took in Abby’s home, her phone rang. She pulled it from her pocket and felt her heart stop. Elijah’s name flashed across the screen. Her instant reaction was to ignore the call, Alex wasn’t ready to talk to him, but she also wanted to answer it. Alex wanted to hear Elijah’s soothing voice.Taking a shaky breath, she answered. “Elijah.”“Hello, Alexandra,” said Elijah.Alex asked, “What can I do for you?”“I wanted to check how you were doing.”“I’m fine.”“I’m glad.” He sounded sincere.She asked, “Was that all?”“No.”Alex swallowed. Her hands were shaking.“I wanted to say that what happened between us—”“It shouldn’t have happened,” she cut him off.“No. I don’t regret it at all.”“Elijah, I….” What could she say to him? She couldn’t make sense of anything.He said, “I know that you have issues with vampires; me being one probably confuses you, so I understand if you’re scared. But I want you to know that your feelings aren’t wrong.”“Aren’t they?”“No.”“Elijah, I am with James.” The phone was silent for too long, and Alex felt sick. She said, “What happened between us was wrong because I am supposed to be in love with someone else. You being a vampire isn’t the only reason.”“Supposed to be?” he asked.Alex leant against the deck railing. That was the detail he hung on to. She shook her head, and the words just spilt out. “I don’t know anymore. Before you, before I came back to Mystic Falls, I knew without a doubt that I loved James. Everything felt right between us. And then you showed up. And for the first time since I learnt about the vampire species, things changed. My magic has always reacted around vampires; it feels like my skin is crawling whenever I’m around them, but not you. I feel this strange sensation, and it’s comforting and warm. And then, when you touch me, my skin burns. It’s hot and addictive, and it makes me crave more.” Alex squeezed her eyes shut. She could still feel Elijah’s hands on her. “What happened last night…being around you, I forget about everything else. I’m not a witch; you’re not a vampire. There’s nothing else to consider. All there is…is just us. And this desperate need to have more.”Elijah said, “I’ve dreamed about you every night since we met.”Alex opened her eyes.“I think about you constantly. And when you kissed me, you woke something up that I thought I wasn’t capable of feeling anymore.”Alex’s hand gripped the railing. What was she doing? She was confessing all of these things that shouldn’t be true. Alex had never wanted to have this uncontrollable desire that felt it was ripping her in half. “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do,” she said. “I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel.”“Alex—”“I’m sorry,” she said. “I can’t.” Alex hung up the phone. Her chest felt tight, and her head throbbed. She needed to stop thinking about how fucked up she was and focus on what really mattered; saving Elena.Alex turned to walk back inside and found Elena standing in the doorway. The look in her eyes told Alex she had heard everything.“You were with Elijah?” she asked.Alex nodded. “Yeah.”“I thought….”“I don’t know,” said Alex. “What happened shouldn’t have happened, but I kind of lost it. I was freaking out about what had happened at the house, and I called him. He was someone I didn’t think would judge me. And he didn’t. We talked, and it was confusing while somewhat enlighting, and it just kind of happened.”“What happened exactly?”“I kissed him.”“You? You kissed him?”“Yeah. He was about to ask me if he could kiss me, at least, I think he was, and I just lost all sense of my morals and went for it.”“So you kissed Elijah? Someone who isn’t your boyfriend and is also a vampire? The species that you keep telling me is monstrous and needs to die?”“I never said it made any sense. And it was a little more than just a kiss.”Elena looked at Alex wide-eyed.“We may have…humped?” she said. Alex buried her face into her hands. She can’t believe she just admitted that.“Woah!”Alex gripped her hair.“Alex, are you okay?”Alex shook her head. “No, I’m not. I’m falling apart because I have no idea what is wrong with me. I thought I loved James, but how could I do such a thing to him if I loved him? My body is extremely reactive or attracted to Elijah, and whenever I get close to him, I forget about the world around me. Not to mention, as you put, he’s a vampire. A vampire that I let suck on my neck and give me the greatest orgasm of my life.” She snapped her mouth shut as that last part came out.Elena placed her hands together and covered her mouth. Alex looked at her with panic, and while she could see the shock and confusion all over Elena’s face, she was glad that there was no judgement. Alex knew that everything that had happened made her a horrible person, but she didn’t think she could take Elena judging her for her hypocritical actions.“Okay, that was something I didn’t need to know,” said Elena. She reached out and grasped Alex’s hands. “But I think you need to take a minute and breathe.” She smiled. “You aren’t thinking clearly, and it’s only going to make you feel more out of control.”Alex took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Elena was right. “I don’t know what to do,” said Alex.Elena nodded. “I know. And we can work it out.”“No, we have to get the spell and get back to Mystic Falls.”Elena said, “Yes, but Bonnie is talking to Abby, and they really need to talk. So while they deal, we can deal with you.”Alex groaned but nodded.“Now. Let’s make this simple. Forget about the events of last night—”“This morning.”Elena nodded slowly. “Okay, this morning. Forget about Elijah for a second. James. How does James make you feel?”Alex smiled and said, “He makes me happy.”“And?” asked Elena.Alex thought about James. He had come into her life when she needed someone. James had been a rock that she hadn’t wanted to admit that she needed, but he had helped her become who she was. Not just a confident witch that could take on vampires, but helped her grow as a person. She said, “Strong. I met him after I left Mystic Falls. He helped me understand who I was as a witch and helped me learn to fight. James is so easy to be around. He’s warm, honest, and no matter what happens, he stands beside me.”Elena nodded. “And what about Elijah?”“He…um….” Alex didn’t know what to say.“Forget that he’s a vampire and that you’re a witch. How does he make you feel?”Alex swallowed. She didn’t want to forget that because remembering what he was, she could deny what she felt.Elena tilted her head and waited.Alex said, “He scares me.”“Why?”Alex let out a heavy sigh and said, “I’ve never felt anything like he brings out of me before. My heart races when I see him,  he touches me and my skin burns, and I feel this overwhelming need for him.”“Do you love him?” asked Elena.“I don’t even know him.” Alex ran her fingers through her hair. “But I think I could.” And possibly already do. Alex knew she couldn’t say it, not yet. “He wasn’t who I thought he would be.”Elena asked, “And do you still love James?”“Not like I thought I did.”Elena pulled Alex towards her and hugged her. They both stood there silently as Alex understood that she had her answer. Alex rested her head on Elena’s shoulder and let a few tears fall. They would head back to Mystic Falls, and Alex wouldn’t only have to tell James that she cheated on him, but she was also going to have to end their relationship. It wasn’t fair for either of them, but Alex couldn’t lie to herself or to James.
  
    Chapter Text
    Alex was feeling a little sorry for herself as they left Abby’s. Even though she now had the desiccation spell, she didn’t feel ready for a fight as they headed back to Mystic Falls. Elena had helped her understand her inner turmoil, and now she couldn’t lie to herself and say everything was going to be fine if she pretended that it didn’t exist. Alex knew she would have to face her mistakes, face the truth, and be fair to James. She didn’t know what would happen with Elijah or if she could ever bring herself to really try, but Alex refused to drag James along and possibly hurt him even more so than she already had.Bonnie was fairing a lot worse. The conversation between her and Abby had gone downhill quickly while Alex and Elena had been outside. Abby had tried to explain why she had never returned to Mystic Falls, and the revelation that not only had Abby never come back but that she had started a new family had set Bonnie off. Abby had remarried and adopted that man’s son as her own. Alex and Elena had both seen the heartbreak behind Bonnie’s anger, but Bonnie hadn’t cried until she got into the car.Elena sat in the backseat with Bonnie. Her arm wrapped around her friend while she cried into her shoulder. It wasn’t fair what Abby had done to Bonnie. And Alex knew it probably would have been better if Bonnie had never known, but there was no changing that now.They arrive in Mystic Falls around eight o’clock. Alex drops Elena and Bonnie off at the house, Bonnie having called Jeremy in the car once she had managed to stop her tears. Alex waited in the driveway until they were both inside before she left. She needed to talk to James, and she would have to do it face to face.Her phone rang as Alex parked outside the motel that James, Sarah, and Robert lived out of. Alex frowned when she saw Renee’s name; she was the last person Alex wanted to deal with, but she couldn’t ignore her.“Hello, Renee.”“Alex. How are things proceeding?” asked Renee.Alex said, “I have a desiccation spell.”“What for?”“To put Klaus down.”“The plan was to kill Klaus.”“It still is. But Mikael is a little more of a loose cannon than I realised. I might have to take him out of the picture for things to go well.”“Mikael is the only one who has a weapon that can kill an original.”Alex rolled her eyes; Renee still treated her like she had no idea what she was doing. Alex said, “Yes that he does. And I’m certain that he wouldn’t leave the weapon lying around with so many people aware of what he has. So, if he does get out of hand and become a liability, I will desiccate him again and take the stake myself.”Renee smacked her lips together and said, “I suppose that would work.”Alex frowned. She hated it when Renee made her sound incompetent.She huffed. “The Council are growing impatient for results, Alex. I should hope that you will be contacting me soon with confirmation of your success.”Alex’s jaw stiffened, and through clenched teeth, she said, “The Council have been trying to kill Klaus for generations. In comparison, I’ve had almost no time at all to deal with him.”Renee scoffed. “Don’t give me excuses.”“It’s not an excuse.”“It sounds like one. The Council won’t tolerate failure, Alexandra.”Alex spat, “I frankly don’t care about the Council. I’m not doing this for them. Elena is my only priority; the Council can go fuck themselves.”“I would be careful the way you speak.”Alex’s grip tightened on the phone. She was sick of being told what to do and what to believe. Everything that the Council preached, everything that Renee had recited over and over, was starting to become more like filtered propaganda the longer she was away from it.“Maybe you find yourself a little too overwhelmed by your current situation. Should I send in another team to take over?” said Renee. Her voice was patronising, like she mocking Alex.“I don’t need help.”“Really? Because you seem awfully comfortable in Elijah’s company.”His name on Renee’s lips made Alex’s chest tighten. What had she seen? Alex asked, “You have someone watching me?”The condescension in Renee’s voice was deafening. “Well, you aren’t that reliable when your emotions get involved, Alexandra. I thought it best to keep a close eye on you, and it seems my gut was right.”Alex wanted to throw her phone down and smash it.“Your time is running out. Find Klaus and kill him. Or, as Mikael suggested, the next step in stopping him will be eliminating the doppelganger.” The line went dead.She felt stupid and angry, oh so very angry. Alex couldn’t fathom how she had been so blind to how narrow-minded and cruel Renee was. It didn’t matter how the results were achieved, as long as they got what they wanted. Renee didn’t care about Alex’s family; she wanted Klaus dead. The Council wanted all vampires dead, no matter the consequences involved in reaching that goal. What scared Alex was the thought that she had missed other things. If she had been blind to how Renee truly saw her – as a tool to be used – then what else had the Council done that she had never seen. Was she wrong to believe that every vampire she had killed had hurt innocents? The Council spread the stories of how vampires spent every second of their existence indulging in their darkest desires, slaughtering humans, and spreading their disease. But what if they were wrong?It took Alex a few minutes to actually get out of the car. She didn’t know if her legs would carry her to James’ room, but she needed to talk to him. About everything.Upstairs, Alex knocked on James’ door. It took a minute, but James pulled open her door dressed in a pair of boxes. He looked like he had been asleep. “Alex?” His face jerked to full awareness, and he grasped her face and pulled her towards him. Before James could kiss her, she turned her head. His lips pressed against her cheek, and Alex saw his confusion in the corner of her eyes.Alex walked past James into his room and moved to stand by the window.James asked, “Did you get the spell?”She nodded. “Yep. Abby Bennett wrote down everything we need.”“That’s great,” he said. His hands touched Alex’s shoulders, and she shivered. “Alex, what’s wrong?”“I did something…something that you might hate me for, but I need to tell you because…I don’t want to lie to you.”James squeezed her shoulder. “I couldn’t hate you.”“I cheated on you,” she said.James’ hands stiffened and then dropped. The silence was heavy, but Alex didn’t know if she could say the next thing. James said, “Elijah.”Alex spun around and looked at James, stunned. “How?”James sighed and moved to drop onto the edge of the unmade bed. “I could tell from the moment I saw you two together.”“Tell what?” she asked.“Do you remember when we first met?” he asked.She nodded.“You were arguing with Renee about a spell. I’d come to give her a message, and she left me alone with you and asked me to help you.” James smiled. “You hated being told that what you were doing was wrong, but it made you work harder. Alex, you push back when you’re challenged, and it was one of the things I grew to love about you. You are stubborn, and you wear your feelings on your face. Even when you think you have managed to hide it, your eyes say everything for you.” James looked down at his hands. “When I went with you to speak with Elijah and Jonas, I saw the way you looked at him. And the way he looked at you. I don’t think you realised it at the time, but you couldn’t take your eyes off him. The way you stood in that apartment, you were so aware of him.”Alex swallowed. James was right; from the second she got anywhere near Elijah, she could feel him, and she struggled to focus on anything else.“You’ve never looked at me the way you looked at him,” said James.Alex felt the welling of tears and her heartbreaking. “I’m sorry,” she said, her voice cracking.James stood and shook his head. “I don’t blame you. Sometimes things are meant to last, and from the day I knew I loved you, I had a feeling that I wouldn’t get to spend the rest of my life with you. But I told myself that whatever time I did get, I would cherish.” He crossed over to her and cupped her cheek.Alex placed her hand over his and squeezed her eyes shut as her tears fell. “I never deserved you,” she said.James smiled. “Yeah, you did.”Alex choked down her sob and asked, “I thought you would at least yell or break something.”James said, “Believe me, I want to. But I think I’ll save that anger for when we take down Klaus.”A soft buzzing from James’ bedside pulled James’ attention. He stepped away to grab his phone, and he frowned. “It’s Renee,” he said.Alex tensed.James looked up. “Something else happen that you haven’t told me?”“I might have told Renee that she and the Council could go fuck themselves.”James’ eyebrows shot up. “Why?”“Renee implied that I was wasting time and not really trying to kill Klaus. She was treating me like I’ve never done this before.”“Technically, we haven’t. An Original is still a new one.”“Okay, fine. But the Council have been trying to kill the Originals for generations. We’ve had a few days. Besides, I’m not so sure that I trust the Council or Renee, not anymore.”“Alex—”“No, don’t Alex me with your common sense. Renee has done nothing but keep stuff from me. Did you know the Ravenwood’s were an original founding family of the Council? That my grandmother, her parents and her parents before them were a part of the Council?” she asked.James frowned. “Seriously?”“Yeah. I asked her about it, and she claimed that I never asked. That isn’t something you need to ask about. Renee should have wanted to tell me all about my family, especially if what the Council was doing was right. Wouldn’t I want to learn about my families legacy and continue it?” Alex huffed.“Why would they hide that? It makes no sense,” said James.“Whatever the reason, I’m going to find out. But first, we kill Klaus and Mikael or at least desiccate him. Make sure Elena is safe from everyone, including the Council. And then, I will find out the truth even if I have to beat it out of every single Council member,” stated Alex.James looked at Alex with unease. “How’d you find out about your family?”“Elijah. He knew my grandmother.”“Really?”“Yeah. Apparently, they met when she was young and still a member of the Council. He said that she ended up leaving the Council and working against them,” she explained.James said, “Don’t get mad, but are you sure he isn’t lying?”“He has no reason to,” said Alex.“He’s a vampire, Alex.”Alex almost laughed. It seemed the shoe was on the other foot now. “I trust him more than I trust Renee.”James seemed unsure.“Renee threatened Elena. Told me that if we didn’t kill Klaus, they’d kill Elena.”James’ eyes darkened, and his hands clenched. “But Elena is innocent in all of this.”“Doesn’t seem to matter. Elena is the doppelganger, and they will do whatever it takes to stop Klaus from breaking his curse.”Alex ground her teeth together as she watched James. A million things seemed to be going through his mind. It seemed that everything was changing for the both of them. The Council had become their lives, and James had worked under them for a lot longer than she had. She had no idea what James would decide to do, but Alex knew she couldn’t go back once Klaus was dealt with. There was no going back now.
  
    Chapter Text
    The full moon was in a week, and Alex couldn’t relax. Things had been almost boring, and that had Alex on edge more than ever. Klaus hadn’t made an appearance since he had been inhabiting Alaric’s body, Mikael had been silent since he killed Alaric, and Alex hadn’t heard from Renee since she threatened Elena. Alex was waiting for the shoe to drop, mainly because she was still avoiding Elijah.After her conversation with James and the end of their relationship, Alex hadn’t really gone anywhere. She had stayed in the Gilbert house and was somewhat obsessively studying the desiccation spell, coming up with a few different plans for when they face Klaus or Mikael, whichever they had the opportunity to take down first. The only problem was the spell wasn’t something you could just do; it required a human heart to stop, and Alex wasn’t just going to use anyone. Jeremy had offered, but after a lot of yelling from Jenna, Elena, Alex and Bonnie, he had been overruled, and Alaric had stepped forward to be the person whose heart she stopped. It also meant that Alaric had basically been living at the house – which was fine – but the house was starting to feel a little crowded.Jenna decided that what they all needed was something a little more normal, as well as some fresh air. It was how Alex found herself standing on the large porch of the Lockwood’s manor. It was the last place she wanted to be, surrounded by the locals that she had never liked and forced to pretend that their lives were about to be possibly destroyed by a cursed vampire. But it was also the place she needed to be. Everyone she cared about was here; Jenna, Jeremy, Elena. She was keeping an eye on each of them, making sure they weren’t alone.Elena seemed to have Stefan glued to her side, and for the first time in a while, she saw Elena have a carefree moment as Stefan dipped her into a kiss. It made her smile to see Elena so happy, and Alex hated herself for wanting to ruin it by tearing Stefan away from her. Jeremy was with Bonnie, who still seemed glum regarding the truth about her mother, but seemed content to sit by Jeremy. And Jenna was with Alaric, and while Alaric wasn’t supernatural, he could at least give Jenna a chance to run. Damon was also bouncing around, clinking his glass with Alaric occasionally as well as talking to a few of the town’s council members.All in all, it seemed to be a normal town affair.Alex walked back inside the house to head over to the bar. Of course, the event had been declared semi-formal, so Alex needed a drink to deal with the heels Elena had thrown at her to wear. They were comfortable for six-inch heels, but she knew her feet would hate her later. She ordered herself a scotch and smiled gladly as she picked it up to take a sip.“I would have thought as a Founding Family member you would enjoy such events.”Alex turned to see Jonas Martin. He leant against the bar beside her and ordered his own drink. “Dr Martin, I didn’t expect to find you at such an event.”“I don’t normally come to these things, but I actually wanted to talk to you.”“What about?”“The last time we spoke, Elijah explained the plan. We want to find the location of the dead witches to harness their magic.”Alex said, “Perhaps we should discuss this where there are fewer ears.”Jonas nodded, and they walked away from the bar and back outside. They moved to stand to the far side on the back porch, where no one would be able to surprise them from behind. Alex took a seat on a wooden bench that sat against the railing and said, “I don’t know the location of where the witches died.”“Have you looked?”“Honestly, no. Things have been…busy. I’ve been making progress on a plan of my own, however.”“Such as?”“A desiccation spell. It won’t kill Klaus, but it will allow us to put him down temporarily while we find a more permanent solution.”“Such as Mikael using the white oak stake?”“That, or if for any reason that isn’t possible—”“Why would that be?”“Klaus hasn’t survived Mikael for a thousand years because he is stupid. He knows how Mikael thinks and can anticipate him. I think it’s just as likely that Klaus will kill Mikael as Mikael will kill Klaus when it comes down to it.”“And if Mikael is killed?”“The white oak stake will most likely be destroyed in the process, leaving us without a way to kill an original.”Jonas nodded.“Dr Martin,” started Alex.“Jonas, please.”Alex nodded. “Jonas. Why are you so invested in stopping Klaus?”He looked at her and seemed to study her face; it was like he was trying to decide if he could trust her or not. Jonas looked around at the grounds before them and said, “I have a daughter, Greta. She is a powerful young witch, so full of life. And one day, she just disappeared. I spent weeks trying to track her down, and when I finally did, I learned that she was with Klaus.” Jonas clenched his hands together. “I thought that perhaps Klaus had kidnapped her, that he was using her to find a way to break the curse, but I was wrong. I found Greta a few months ago before any whispers of the Doppelganger had reached anyone’s ears, and she told me that helping Klaus is what she believed was right.” Jonas grabbed his drink and swallowed the rest of the liquid, grimacing as it went down. “The way she talked about him…it isn’t her, at least it wasn’t. She spoke like he was a god, someone to be worshipped.” Jonas rubbed his face with his hands.“You are doing all this to get your daughter back?”Jonas nodded. “After I found Greta, I searched for a way, and I found Elijah. We made a deal; I help him kill Klaus, and he helps me get my daughter back. And I will do anything I need to.”Alex said, “I understand that. Which is why you must understand that I will do what I can to help you, but I won’t do it at my sister’s expense. Your plan, while it would eliminate Klaus – at least, you think so – means my sister has to die, and I don’t want that.”Jonas stared at her again before he stood. “Whatever happens, I hope we both get what we want.”Alex remained sitting on the bench as Jonas walked away. She felt sorry for the man. Finishing her drink, Alex stood to go and check on her family. As she walked back towards the doors, she saw Damon and Stefan; they were talking with their heads down, and Damon looked pissed. Knowing nothing good from a pissed of Damon, she walked over to them.“What’s going on?” she asked.Damon turned and sneered at her. “Another problem you’ve caused.”“That I’ve caused.”“Yes, you. Your little pal Mikael is running about, threatening to kill Elena, and you don’t tell us.”Alex glared at him. She had warned Elena about Mikael’s threat – not Renee’s – so she should have known Damon was bound to find out. “Mikael won’t touch her. I won’t let him.”“Somehow, I don’t have much faith in that statement.”“Damon, shut it,” snapped Stefan. He turned to Alex. “Mikael isn’t reliable. I know you want to use him to kill Klaus, but it might be better if we take the stake and do it ourselves.”Alex nodded. “I’ve been thinking the same thing.”Damon and Stefan looked surprised.“You do?” asked Damon.“I do,” she said. “I say we lure him in, desiccate him and then take the stake.”“What if he doesn’t have it on him?” asked Stefan.“Tell him Klaus is somewhere, and he’ll be sure to bring it along,” said Damon.“We need to be careful,” said Alex. “If he suspects anything, he’ll go straight for Elena.”“So we make sure she’s at home, behind your barrier where no bad guys can get her. Along with anyone he could use to lure her out,” states Damon.Alex frowned. “I don’t think I could fit the whole town in the house.”Damon rolled his eyes. “I meant the important people.”Stefan sighed and turned away from them. “You two are exhausting.”“So is your girlfriend,” claimed Damon.“Okay, save your petty sibling squabbling for when I’m not here. Let me talk to James before we go after Mikael. I want to make sure we are prepared for this,” said Alex.Damon asked, “What? Stopping a heart a little scary for you?”Alex smirked and placed her hand on Damon’s shoulder. Damon’s eyes bulged, and he stiffened. “Careful, Damon. I might just desiccate you and lock you in a coffin. Maybe even dump you at the bottom of the ocean.” She removed her hand, and Damon stumbled, gasping for breath as she walked away. She needed another drink.As Alex placed her empty glass down on the bar to get a refill, she felt him. It seemed it was physically impossible for her not to know he was there. Alex let out a small sigh, and she closed her eyes as her head dropped. Elijah stopped beside her, and his hand came to rest on her lower back. Alex could feel the heat of his hand through the thin fabric of her dress.“You look stunning,” said Elijah.Alex lifted her head and turned slightly to face him. He was dressed impeccably as always, but she could see the difference in his eyes. The conflict.“Thank you,” she said.“How have you been?” he asked, his hand dropping.Alex missed the warmth of his touch and said, “I’m okay.”Elijah said, “I wanted to reach out to you sooner, but after we spoke on the phone, I thought perhaps you wouldn’t want to talk to me.”Alex smiled softly. “I appreciate the space. I had a lot of this to work out.”Elijah’s eyes scanned the room, and he said, “I do not see James. Did he not escort you?”Alex wants to laugh at his formal language. Instead, she shook her head and said, “No. James asked for some space.”Elijah frowned. “I’m sorry if I have caused trouble in your relationship.”“You didn’t cause the trouble, Elijah. I did.”“I seem to remember my own participation. You did not act alone.”Alex did remember. In fact, the remembering hadn’t been an issue. “No, I suppose not.”“I would be happy to reassure James. Tell him that what happened will not occur again.”“So sure, are you?” Alex wasn’t sure how to feel about that. She was still stuck in a space of uncertainty when it came to Elijah, but the idea of never feeling his touch again or maybe never kissing again made her miserable.Elijah’s shoulders dropped. “Alexandra, no matter my feelings for you, I would not knowingly lead you into an affair that would hurt you.”Alex couldn’t stop her smile as she said, “There is no affair if there is no longer a third party involved.”Elijah’s face took in the meaning of her words, and Alex noticed the small quirk of the corner of his lips.“You ended your relationship with James?”Alex nodded. “We both agreed it would be for the best.” And Alex believed that more than ever. Just standing beside Elijah, she felt everything all over again. The desire to feel him, the need to touch him, was excruciating.Elijah’s hand slid around Alex’s waist and pulled her away from the bar. Alex wasn’t sure where he was leading her, but she let him take her out of the room and down a hall. He pulled open a door and pressed her through it into a small library. Elijah closed the door behind them, the sound of the dock locking catching Alex’s ear as Elijah cupped both sides of her face and pressed her against the wall. Alex felt her breath catch and her heart jump as she took in the feeling of his hands on her skin and how close his lips were to hers.Elijah said, “You didn’t let me finish the last time; I think it’s prudent that this time I ask this before I do what I really want to.” His eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at her face before they relaxed, and he asked, “Can I kiss you?”Alex had woken up that morning not knowing what to do. She had dreamed about Elijah pressing her down onto his bed, the way his lips had moved against hers, and how his teeth had felt against her skin. Everything between them felt so right; how could she say no to this?She slid her hands up his chest, her fingers spreading across his white shirt. She shifted her head, their noses bumping against one another. Alex said, “Yes.”Elijah barely let the word leave her lips before he kissed her. His mouth pressed firmly into hers as his hands cradled her face gently. Alex moaned as her mouth tingled, and she spread her lips so she could feel his tongue snake in. And just like before, it’s everything Alex remembered. The burning touch of his hands, the swift movement of his lips and a taste that Alex needs more of. How could she think even for a second that this wasn’t right?The kiss left Alex panting for breath; her eyes were dilated, and she felt a tingle between her thighs. Alex grasped at the side of Elijah’s face reaching for more, which he granted, pulling a whimper out of her mouth as he pressed their bodies firmly together. The kiss slowed, and Elijah moved his lips to press a kiss to her cheek, her neck and her shoulder. Alex closed her eyes and let her head fall back against the wall as she tried to slow her speeding heart, as Elijah pressed lazy kisses to her skin.Alex wanted another kiss; she wanted to peel off the layers and feel every inch of him, but not here. “This isn’t over,” she said.Elijah smiled and nibbled softly at her shoulder. “No, I think not.”She lifted her head, and he caught her lips again. Alex giggled against his mouth and shifted her hand to tangle in the lengths of his hair at the back of his neck.“But there are things we need to talk about,” he said.Alex nodded.Elijah stepped back, but he kept hold of her hand, and they walked towards a two-seater that sat by the window. Elijah sat before pulling Alex down onto the chair beside him. He looked at her with a calm expression and said, “Starting with Mikael.”Alex panicked. She hadn’t actually told Elijah that she had woken Mikael up. And now she was worried he would be upset with her.“I have known you woke him up for some time,” he said.“I didn’t tell you because, at the time, I didn’t trust you,” she said.Elijah nodded, a comforting smile warming his face. “I know. But you must know that Mikael is dangerous. Probably even more so than Niklaus.”Alex sighed. “Yeah, I’ve been starting to realise my mistake in letting him out.”“While he could cause some complications, he does have the white oak stake.”“Stefan and Damon want to take it from Mikael. Lure him somewhere, desiccate him and take the stake,” she said.Elijah said, “That might work.”Alex lifted her hand to run her fingers along Elijah’s jaw. She smiled when he leaned into her touch before turning his head and kissing her fingers.“Alex, would you come with me?” he asked.She nodded. Alex somehow realised that at this point, she didn’t think she could say no to him.
  
    Chapter Text
    Anticipation. Alex’s whole being was flooded with it as Elijah pulled up outside his home. The house looked different in the dark, but the building was illuminated with bright gardening lighting. Alex hadn’t really paid much attention to the home when she had last been there; she had been asleep when they arrived and had been too busy running to take in the place. But as she looked out the window at the mini-mansion, she couldn’t help but think that it suited Elijah.The door opening did startle Alex slightly. She had been too caught up in the house to notice that Elijah had walked around and opened her door. He smiled at her, amusement on his face, as he held out his hand. Alex took it and stepped out of the car. Elijah led her into the house with his hand on her lower back, and they stopped when they reached the bottom of the staircase.Alex wondered if Elijah wanted to lead her upstairs to continue what they had both wanted back at the Lockwoods. Alex knew she wanted to peel off his suit and explore his hard body while she remembered the feeling of his mouth on her skin. And while they had briefly spoken about what was to come, Alex felt there was more that Elijah wanted to say.“I don’t want to assume anything,” he said.Alex smiled and placed her hands on his shoulders. She drew her palms over the fabric of his expensive jacket and stopped as her fingers reached his neck. “Allow me to clarify exactly what I want.” Her fingers stroked the sides of his neck for just a moment before she turned and pressed her hands beneath his jacket. She pushed it off his shoulders, letting it fall down his arms before grasping the top button of his shirt. Alex kept her eyes locked on Elijah’s as she made her way down, popping each button as she went.Before they had left the Lockwoods, Alex went to tell her family she was leaving. Elena hugged her and told her to be honest to herself; there was nothing wrong with how she felt about Elijah. And Alex wanted to do that. No more hiding, no more denying what she wanted.With Elijah’s shirt unbuttoned, Alex turned her back to Elijah. She twisted her head and waited. Elijah’s hands found her waist as his lips pressed against her bare shoulder. His fingers slid across her dress to the clip that held the dress up. He popped it open and peeled the dress down her body, letting it pool around her ankles.Without her dress, Alex was left only in her six-inch heels and a pair of black lace panties. She shivered as the cool air touched her skin, making her nipples harden. Elijah’s hands slid around her sides to her stomach; he pulled her against him, her back to his chest. He leant down and pressed another kiss to her shoulder, his tongue sweeping across her skin. Alex turned her head to look at him. This man had surprised her; he had found a way inside, and she was grateful because her head, heart and body all wanted the same thing. Him.She lifted a hand to cup the back of Elijah’s head and brought their mouths together. Alex’s body ignited with need. Elijah’s hands caressed her skin, venturing near the places she desperately wanted him to touch, but instead of touching her breasts or sliding his fingers between her legs, he teased her. Alex’s whimpered and groaned into Elijah’s mouth, her body pressed back against him as she tried to ask him to touch her. Elijah hummed with pleasure as she bit at his lip and dug her fingers into his scalp.The breath was slightly knocked from Alex when Elijah swept her into his arms and up the stairs. The scene around them changed as Elijah placed Alex onto the bed, his mouth never leaving hers and catching the sharp breath that escaped her. Elijah moved his mouth to her neck and used his blunt teeth to bite firmly against her jugular, making Alex’s body arch up against him. Alex cried out at the feel of Elijah’s teeth against her throat; her core throb with the need for more.Alex couldn’t stop herself from speculating if Elijah would bite her? If he would bare his fangs and slip them into her vein to taste her. It scared Alex, not that he might drink her blood, but that she wanted him to. Something that should have repulsed her – at least it used to – was now something she almost craved.Elijah placed his hands around Alex’s thighs, his fingers caressing her skin as his mouth moved to her chest. The grazing of his teeth, the sucking of his lips, left a trail as Elijah reached her breasts.Alex squeezed her eyes shut as Elijah’s mouth encased her breast. Her hands ran down Elijah’s neck to drag her nails over his shoulder blade as his tongue traced her areola. She lifted her leg, kicked off her shoes and hooked her leg over Elijah’s hip, rolling her body beneath him. Her hips pressed against his hardening and still concealed cock, her chest pressing her breast harder against Elijah’s mouth.With a loud pop, Alex’s breast fell from Elijah’s lips. He said, “You are beautiful, Alexandra.”Her full name made Alex blush. Elijah’s dark eyes are filled with want. He kept his gaze locked on her as his hand moved between them to touch the lace of her underwear. His finger traced her mound before sliding over the bump to press down on her covered clitoris. Alex squeaked and lifted her hips, trapping Elijah’s hand between them and giving more stimulation to the small ball.“I want to taste you,” he said.Elijah slowly worked his way down, kissing, sucking, tasting her. He peeled her underwear down her legs before pulling her legs apart and pushing her legs up so her knees were bent. Elijah nuzzled softly at her inner thigh, his teeth nipping at the skin as his fingers tickled her legs. Alex made a small whine, but it broke into a sharp gasp as his tongue touched her folds. Alex dug her finger into his hair as her hips jolted, her body seeking more. Elijah took his time to swirl his tongue along her slit. He lapped at her dripping juices, tasting her essence, before pressing his tongue into her centre. Alex made a low moan, and her thighs tried to clench around his head. Elijah smirked against her centre; one of his hands pressed her thigh down, flattening it on the bed so he could shift his mouth to her clit. He used his other hand to touch her opening and teased her with two fingers.“Elijah,” Alex whimpered. “Please.”Elijah groaned at the sound of her plea and pressed his fingers into her opening.Alex let out a needy cry as her walls clenched around the thick digits moving inside her. “Oh, god,” she whispered.He slid his finger in and out, pulling more sounds out of Alex, and only removed his fingers so he could press his tongue back into her centre. Elijah used his tongue, teeth, and fingers to push Alex towards the intense build in her stomach, but he didn’t let her fall over the edge.Alex was panting for breath, a sound of disappointment falling from her as Elijah pulled himself back. Alex looked down at his dark eyes and could see the glisten of her fluids on his lips. Elijah pushed himself to stand and licked his lips. Alex swallowed as she watched him unbutton his pants and push them down with his briefs. She admired his naked form, how his body was muscular and defined. And then there was his cock; hard and large, and Alex wanted to touch it, to taste it.Elijah dropped his shirt off his shoulders before kneeling back over her. He cupped her thighs and lined his body with Alex’s, as she placed at hand behind his neck while the other grasped the comforter beside her. His eyes didn’t leave hers as he pushed in. His length stretched Alex’s walls, and the burn felt so good. Alex cried out as Elijah slowly made his way inside. His thrusts were slow, painfully slow, but as her insides stretched to let his whole length bury into her, Alex’s toes curled, and her voice broke as she started to cum.Elijah groaned as Alex’s body trembled around him. His hands held her thighs firmly, and as she squirmed beneath him, he increased his movement. His slow thrusts grew faster, the power behind each thrust making Alex whimper as his length found every nerve inside her. They quickly establish a rhythm of their movements; Alex lifting her hips to meet Elijah’s thrust, Elijah pressed his lips to her body, biting and licking over every inch of her skin.Alex is the one who grabbed Elijah and brought their lips back together. His lips and tongue are tainted with a new taste, and Alex groaned at the thought that the taste was hers and wanted more. They are all teeth and spit, moaning and gasping into each other’s mouths, tasting every inch they can as Elijah slipped a hand down between their bodies and pressed against her clit, making her cry out into his mouth. He took the hand Alex had twisted in the comforter and linked their finger together, holding their hands above her head as he changed the angle of his thrusts to rub his cock along her clit as he slid in and out of her. As their eyes meet again, Alex wants to tell him she loves him, at least she thinks she does. But then she’s cumming; squeezing and shaking around him, and he slammed into her as she breathed out his name. And after a few more thrusts, Elijah let go, shuddering as pleasure swept through his body from his head to the tips of his toes. *** Alex stretched out along the bed with Elijah behind her. He had an arm wrapped around her waist, and she had her head resting on his other arm. Alex felt content in Elijah’s arms; she smiled as he pressed a number of kisses to her shoulder, her neck and her back. She closed her eyes and let the sensation flow over her. She knew that she should be tired, but even though her body felt heavy with exhaustion and satisfaction, she didn’t want to sleep.Elijah’s arm tightened around her waist, and he nuzzled his face into her throat.Alex said, “Do all vampires have a fascination with the throat?”A deep chuckle resonated from Elijah’s throat and tickled her skin. He said, “Perhaps. I’ve never queried such a thing myself.” His nose nudged her ear. “I, however, do find myself particularly fascinated with your neck.” Elijah pressed a kiss to her ear before moving his face to kiss a small indent on her shoulder.Alex shivered.Elijah said, “And I plan on enjoying every inch of it.” He bit down lightly, and his arm around her waist tightened again.Alex twisted, wanting to look at him. She grasped his hair, finding that she enjoyed playing with his hair while also tugging on the ends. “I look forward to it.” She kissed him deeply before pulling back to turn all the way over so they were looking in each other’s eyes.Alex ran her hand across his chest, tracing his collarbone and said, “Tell me about your family.”Elijah said, “I thought you knew our story.”She nodded. “I know the witch version. The one where your mother manipulated nature to turn you all into unkillable beasts. But I don’t really know who your family are. I don’t even know how many siblings you have.”Elijah’s hand stroked her back. He said, “Well, there were a total of seven Mikaelson children in total.”“And were you the oldest?”“No. My parents firstborn was a girl; her name was Freya, but she died while my mother was pregnant with me. It’s actually the reason my parents moved from Norway; they travelled to a land where our family was supposed to be safe.”“Isn’t that how every story starts; parents that want the best for their children?”“I guess they do.”Alex said, “So, your the second eldest? Who came after you?”Elijah shook his head. He said, “Actually, I’m the third child. I have an older brother, Finn. He was old enough to remember Freya, and while he never spoke about her, Mother said that losing her changed him.”Alex frowned; a brief look of pain shot through her chest. She said, “I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to lose Elena or Jeremy.”“The pain never goes away, but you find that with each passing day, it gets a little easier to smile.” The understanding in his words explained his sad look.Alex slid her hand around the back of his neck, her thumb rested on his cheek. “You lost another sibling?”He nodded. “We did. Henrik was the youngest of us all.”She scrunched up her brow. “Okay, let’s do this in order, or I’ll get everyone confused. So, there was Freya, then Finn. Followed by you.”Elijah nodded. “After me came Niklaus, then Kol, then Rebekah and lastly, Henrik.”Alex couldn’t imagine having so many siblings. But with such a big family, Alex wondered where they all were. Had Klaus killed them all? Elijah had only ever mentioned that he couldn’t see them, but that could mean many things. Alex supposed it was possible to be estranged after a thousand years, but Elijah seemed to really hate Klaus. He wanted to kill his own brother. Whatever Klaus had done, it had to have been to their siblings. “What happened to Henrik?” she asked.Elijah shifted. His leg slid between Alex’s. He said, “The village we lived as a part of had neighbours; a pack of werewolves. We didn’t call them that, but we were forbidden to go on their land, and they left us alone. And for a very long time, I guess you could say we lived peacefully. Every full moon, our whole village would take shelter in a series of caves so that when our neighbours turned, we were safe. But one night, Niklaus’ curiosity got the better of him. He snuck off to watch the men turn, but Henrik followed. Niklaus was unscathed, but Henrik was killed. The next morning when we were all frantically searching for them, Niklaus came back screaming. He was carrying Henrik in his arms; he was barely recognisable.”Alex stroked his cheek. She almost regretted asking him about such a thing. “That must have been horrible.”“It was. Our parents were inconsolable and desperate. Henrik’s death is what drove my mother to turn us into vampires. She wanted to make it so we would never die.”“She did a lot more than that.”“That she did, and she even admitted that what she did was wrong. Her mentor warned her about messing with nature, but she did not listen. I think before she died, she was regretful with what she did to us.”“How did she die?” asked Alex.“Mikael. He tore out her heart after learning that Niklaus was the result of an affair she’d had with another man.”“A werewolf man?”“Yes.”Alex looked away and glanced at the ceiling. She said, “Your mother not only created vampires, but she created a hybrid of two of the strongest creatures on this planet. The amount of power she possessed….”Elijah smiled and asked, “Am I sense envy?”Alex smirked. “Maybe a little. While I don’t agree with the creation of your kind—”“Well, that’s new coming from you.”She chuckled. “My perspective has changed on the topic.”“I suppose I should be glad about that.”Alex nodded and pulled herself up so she was leaning slightly over him. “That you should, otherwise our position right now would be very different.”“How so?” he asked. His lips spread into a smirk.The look on Elijah’s face sent a shudder of desire through Alex. It’s so different from his normal collected look that she wanted to impress it into her memory. “Well, for one. We wouldn’t be naked.” Alex placed her hand on the centre of Elijah’s chest and used it to lift herself up and straddle his waist. She felt his body react to her bare centre pressing down on him, and she couldn’t stop the slight roll of her hips.Elijah placed his hands on Alex’s thighs and groaned softly as his eyes roamed her body. “Now, that would be a pity.”Alex tilted her head to the side, a sexy smirk lighting her face as she said, “Or maybe we would. I’ve heard hate sex is supposed to be fantastic.” She wiggled her eyebrows.“I wouldn’t know.”She looked at him with disbelief. “Really? In a thousand years, you’ve never hate fucked anyone?”Elijah snorted out a laugh. “Charming, but no. My enemies never gave me the urge to rip their clothes off and have my way with them.”Alex moved her hips again. Elijah’s fingers tightened, the tips digging into her skin. She asked, “Only witches do that for you?”Elijah sat up, his hands holding Alex’s thighs to keep her from falling back, and pressed their chests together. His cock was growing harder by the second, and as he moved, the hardening length rubbed against Alex’s dampening folds. He lifted a hand to cup her face and said, “While there may have been a few witches that I grew fond of, none have ever captivated me the way you have.”Alex bit down on her lip. “That was smooth.” It made her heart flutter and her centre ache.“Thousand years of practice.” Elijah’s hands grasped at her ass cheeks. His hands pulled her thighs open so he could press himself harder against her.Alex licked her lips slowly, her eyes flickering to Elijah’s mouth. “Maybe we should put that practice to use.”“Certain—”Alex kissed Elijah firmly, her hips rolled against his. Elijah groaned into her mouth and lifted her body enough that he could line his length with his centre before lowering her to sink down.“Fuck,” Alex hissed, his length stretching her open, giving her that delicious burn. She flexed her muscles slightly, enjoying how Elijah’s cock throbbed inside her, before lifting herself back up.Elijah held her firmly and yanked her body down onto him. It’s hard and good. Alex threw her head back as her mouth fell open as his cock found her bundle of nerves. It was like a shock with each thrust, jolting over and over, making Alex barely able to find a chance to breathe or think of anything else.Alex’s orgasm came fast. Her centre clenched around Elijah, and as she dropped back down onto him, her pleasure breaking through, Elijah rolled them over and took control. He lifted her legs over his arms and found a way to barrel himself even deeper. Alex opened her eyes to take in Elijah’s clenched jaw and the strain of his neck as he moved. She reached for his chest, tracing her nails over his skin and pulled his head down so she could reach his neck. Alex sucked on his pulse point, loving the sound of his groan in her ear, before biting down as hard as she could, which sent him over the edge. His body stiffening and his last few thrusts were left him panting as he held himself above her.Rolling them back onto their sides, Elijah kissed Alex and pulled himself from her. Alex missed the feeling of him inside her, but as they lay there, the sweat on her skin starting to cool, she felt like she needed a shower, but she didn’t want to move.“How about a bath?” asked Elijah.Alex smiled widely. “That sounds amazing.”When neither of them moved, and Alex laughed. It seemed neither of them wanted to move.

  The Truth
Alex kept her eyes firmly on Elijah. He had stepped away from her and had taken a seat on a tree that had fallen over a long time ago, moss and plants had grown over it and moulded it into the ground. He placed his elbows on her knees and clasped his hands together before resting his forehead on them.He cleared his throat before he spoke. “The reason you’re grandmother, Nadia, left was because she caught the Council siphoning a young witches magic.”Alex frowned.“The young witch apparently had fallen in love with a vampire, said vampire was supposed to have been her target, and when she failed to kill him the Council declared her a traitor,” said Elijah.Alex swallowed and bit down on her lip. The Council enjoyed punishing those that they had decided had either broken the rules or betrayed them. Punishments were determined based on the level of severity, but no witch should ever have their magic drained from them. If anything, that was against nature. It made Alex sick to think that innocent witches had suffered like that. “What happened to the witches after?” she asked. Alex didn’t want to know, but she needed to.“Nadia wasn’t sure. The witch she discovered died after the siphoning.” Elijah stood up and reached for her. “Are you okay?”Alex stepped away. She needed to think.“Alex?” he pressed.“No, I’m not.” She wrapped her arms around herself. Anger, disbelief and sadness were all bubbling inside of her. Alex wasn’t sure which one was going to bubble over, but she didn’t know what to do.If the Council were stealing witches magic, no matter how guilty they were, they needed to be stopped. And it also meant she was right. Alex might not be the monster herself, but she had been working for them. Doing their bidding and killing god knows how many innocents.Sadness was the first emotion to push her over. The tears fell from her eyes and her knees collapsed beneath her. Her body shook, and Alex couldn’t stop the sob that ripped through her chest.Elijah’s arms wrapped around her and pulled her body gently against his. He stroked her hair and hushed her gently, offering no words but comforting her with his touch.Alex grasped at his shirt and buried her face into his neck. Everything she had been told was a lie, Renee had brought her into a world that was nothing but cruel and hateful. Alex wanted to go back to the days that she was naive of it all.It took a few moments, but Alex managed to pull herself together. She kept her face buried in Elijah’s neck and asked, “Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”His grip tightened around her. “I wasn’t sure if you knew or not. Only when you mentioned before about possibly changing their mind did it confirm for me that you didn’t know.”She pulled back and wiped her eyes. “What I want to know is why? No witch deserved to be cut off from their magic.”Elijah cupped her chin. He said, “I don’t know. But Nadia spent her life trying to help those that the Council were determined to destroy.” He pressed a kiss to her forehead.“I wish I could have known her.” Alex snuggled back into Elijah’s chest. It was all too much. Nothing was simple anymore, and the one moment she thought when things could be normal, just for a little while her whole world had imploded.“She would have loved you.” Elijah squeezed her.The comment brought a soft smile and a warmth to her chest. It softened the rest of her emotions and allowed her to take a breath. “I’m going to stop them,” she mumbled. “We are going to stop Klaus, save Elena and then destroy the fucking Council.”“Just like Nadia,” said Elijah. ~ The rest of the morning spent along the stream, Alex and Elijah talked about everything but the Council. After her small meltdown, Alex was determined to make their first date better. Elijah spoke about his life as a human, she got the full details of his family and a better understanding of how his mother, the original witch, had turned them all into vampires and why. She had to admit it was instead a sad story, and if Klaus hadn’t turned into such a psychopath, she might actually feel sorry for him.Alex had also given him the rundown of her childhood, including a few embarrassing stories, the first time she kissed a boy, and a few of her favourite family moments. Their time had felt normal, the witch and vampire business had been completely forgotten.But by the time noon rolled around Alex’s stomach demanded food. Alex had been tempted to head to the Grill, but the thought of having to answer everyone’s questions about why she and Elijah were together didn’t make it appealing.Instead, Alex directed Elijah to the supermarket so that she could buy the ingredients to make them lunch. On the drive down, she bragged about her home-made pizzas and he insisted that he could make the best garlic bread. With the food decided, Alex had almost burst into a fit of giggles when she realised how mundane they truly were acting. It also amused her to watch Elijah as he compared the different types of pineapple he could buy.“What’s with the pineapple?” she asked.He smiled. “Pineapple on pizza is one of my favourites.”Alex screwed up her face.“And before you judge me,” he leant down close enough that their noses touched, “I am a thousand-year-old vampire who has tasted the best food in the world.”Alex sniggered at him.“And when I say pineapple on pizza is good, you have no right to say otherwise.” Elijah finished and placed a quick kiss on her lips.Alex shook her head. He was playful; it was something she had never imagined she would see. When they had first met, he seemed polite and a little stiff, but the cheeky smile on his face and the way he snuck a quick kiss from her, showed a side that she could tell didn’t come out too often.“You could be as old as the planet and I still wouldn’t agree with you.” Alex grabbed the pineapple from his hand and dropped it into the basket she was carrying.“Have you ever tried it?” he asked.“No! Eww.” Alex scrunched up her nose and reached to grab some peppers.“Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.” Elijah placed a hand on his hip and pointed a carrot at her.She laughed at him. “Who are you? Where has serious Elijah gone?”Elijah shrugged and put the carrot back. “He isn’t needed right now, and for the first time in a long time I feel happy.”Alex smirked and leant into his side. “Well, I like this side of you.” She reached up on his toes and placed a kiss on his cheek, before heading out of the produce section to the bakery to grabbed some pizza bases.When they arrived back at the Gilbert house, it was empty. All of the items that had been lying around the house as the girls prepared for the Founder’s Day weekend had been cleared out the house looked cleaner than it had all week.Alex and Elijah both got to work and started cooking. Elijah made his supposed best garlic bread ever before allowing Alex to boss him around. They two of them worked together and Alex smiled as she pictured their domestic appearance. Anyone who would walk through the door would think nothing about them other than a young couple who were making lunch.The front door opened and both Alex and Elijah paused. Elena appeared through the doorway and smiled when she saw them cooking.“Looks like I got home at the perfect time,” she said.Alex smiled. “I thought you would be at the celebration all day?”Elena shrugged. “I escaped. Stefan is coming over and we were going to hang out. Can we join you?”Alex sighed and looked at Elijah. He just shrugged his shoulders. “Elena, this is still new and it’s not supposed to be information that everyone knows.”Elena rolled her eyes. “Then you shouldn’t have been flirting at the store. Caroline spotted you and snapped a picture. Everyone knows.”Alex frowned. She was going to kill that girl.Elijah put down the knife in his hand and placed his hands of Alex’s shoulders. “Don’t worry,” he said. “I will be happy to kill anyone who objects.”Alex turned her frown in his direction and lifted her knife up and pointed it at him. “Not funny.”Elijah smiled and kissed her.“You too act like you have been at this forever,” said Elena. Her smile was full, and a particularly pleasing look swirled in her eyes.Alex didn’t respond, she picked up a piece of bell pepper and popped it into her mouth. She couldn’t say Elena was wrong though. When she had been with James, the natural flow of their relationship had taken months to form. With Elijah, it was as natural as breathing. Both of them seemed to understand each other without evening speaking, almost like it was an instinct.Thinking of James allowed dread to fall into her stomach. If everyone knew, then it was going to get back to James and that was the last thing she wanted. This type of thing needed to come from her directly and the fact that Elijah was a vampire of all things wasn’t going to make it any easier.James’ reactions also meant that he could tell Renee which could get back to the Council. While Alex had decided the Council were evil and needed to be stopped, there were plenty of witches on their team and she had Klaus to focus on. The thought that the Council would send witches to hunt her down wasn’t ideal.Alex tried to calm down and keeps her thoughts at bay until later. Her day with Elijah had already been interrupted by his revelation about the Council, she wanted to enjoy the rest of it. Alex focused on the food and got them into the oven as Stefan arrived. She was relieved that the awkwardness she had expected seemed to have decided not to show itself.The awkwardness appeared though when Renee’s name popped up on Alex’s phone. She frowned at it and didn’t want to answer, but what good would ignoring it do. Alex grabbed her phone and stepped outside. Worry flooded her insides, but she took a deep breath and answered.

    The phone rang and rang, and Alex thought that Renee wasn’t going to answer for a few moments. But when Renee picked, Alex heard the scoff and the smug sound of her voice, and she wanted to hurt her. “Alexandra.”“I know, Renee.”“Know what?”“I know about the syphoning.”Renee laughed. “And?”Alex snapped. “I can’t believe you preach how better the Council is than everyone else, but behind the scenes, you are worse than vampires.”Renee scoffed. “No, that’s where you are wrong. Vampires should never have existed. They are disgusting, vile things that I take great pleasure in destroying. You did, too, once, if I recall. What the Council does is what nature demands.”“How is tearing a witches gift from her what nature demands? Nature gave them that gift. You have no right.”“A witch who turns against their own kind, a witch who entangles themselves with vampires, is no longer a witch. They are an abomination in her own right, and her gift is no longer theirs.”Alex had no words.“Their magic is bestowed to those who do desire it.”“Someone like you?”Renee sighed. “Yes, exactly. And I will take great pleasure in ripping yours from you.”“You’ve taken enough from me. You are delusional if you think I’ll ever allow you to take my magic.”Renee giggled like she was giddy with excitement. “You remind me so much of Nadia.”Alex felt her heart leap into her throat.“She was so confident too. After she learnt about the syphoning, she took off. Determined to make up for our sins is what she claimed. And she defiled herself with vampires, but not quite like you did. While I didn’t see the show, I have a feeling that you let the vampire use you like the whore you are.”Alex clenched her fist. “You know nothing.”Renee’s voice was harsh. “I know everything, Alexandra. I have known your every move since you returned to Mystic Falls. I also know that you won’t be able to stop Klaus, so I will have to kill Elena. Then I will take your desiccation spell and use it on your original pet. And then maybe, just because I can, I will kill every last person who you care about. Jeremy, Jenna, Sarah, Robert. And James, well, I like James. He knows how to treat a woman. If he’s smart, he will fall into line, but if I have to, I will enjoy killing him as well. And then, I will give you what you deserve. A slow and painful death.” She hissed out those last few words with so much pleasure that Alex felt goosebumps appear on her arms.Alex said, “You can threaten everyone if that makes you feel better, Renee. But I will kill Klaus. And once I’ve done that, I’ll show you exactly how wrong about me you are.” Alex hung up the phone and let out a shaky breath. She hadn’t gone into the phone call with a positive feeling. Renee had always been rather blunt and honest, but the bitch who had spoken to her was someone else entirely. It made Alex frown that she had spent so long with this woman, had trusted her, considered her a friend, and she was nothing like she had portrayed.The back door opened, and Alex looked up. James looked weary as he closed the back door behind him and took a seat beside her. After she had explained what she had learned about the Council, James had kind of shut down. Robert and Sarah had both stated that they couldn’t be a part of a coven that would do such a thing, and they were ready to stand against Renee and any other members of the Council that got sent their way. James hadn’t been as vocal, but he had agreed with them. They had shortly left after, heading back to their hotel to pack up and move somewhere the Council wasn’t aware of.They had been gone over an hour, and now James was back. He placed his hand on her knee and said, “I take it that was Renee?”Alex nodded. “She’s psychotic.”“Yeah. She sounded insane when I spoke to her.”“You called her?”“No, she rang me. There are orders to take you in.”Alex sighed. “I shouldn’t be surprised.”“You have nothing to worry about. I told her we are out and that she would have to bring you in herself. I’m done being her lap dog.”Alex placed her hand over James. “I know I have no right to ask, but I need your help.”James smiled softly. “You never have to ask, Alex. I’ll always be on your side.”She returned the smile and leaned her head on his shoulder. “Thank you.”James pressed a kiss to her forehead. “You are welcome.”They sat there for a moment in silence before her phone buzzed. It was Elijah, checking in with her. She wanted to ask him to come to her, but that wasn’t fair on James. She didn’t want to rub how quickly she had moved on from him.“It’s okay to be happy,” said James.Alex locked her phone. “I know. I want you to be happy too.”“I will, maybe not today. You’re not an easy woman to forget.” He laced their fingers together. “Once we kill Klaus, save Elena, and possibly fight Renee, I think I’ll travel. Maybe Sarah would like to go to Europe.”Alex smiled. “Sounds good to me.”“I’ll send you a postcard.”“I look forward to it.” Alex pulled her hand from James’ and stood up. She slid her hands into her back pockets and said, “Stefan and Damon have a plan for Mikael.”“Desiccation?”“Yeah. They want to lure him out, trick him into thinking Klaus is vulnerable. Then we can desiccate him and take the white oak stake. And then we can go after Klaus and kill him ourselves. That way, there is one less threat towards Elena,” explained Alex.James nodded. “Sounds like a solid plan. Robert and I can help the Salvatore’s with their direct assault on Mikael. Sarah can stick with you and cover your back while you perform the spell.”Alex nodded. “I’ll need to link myself to you all, and then anyone can get the connection.”“I’ll let Robert and Sarah know.” He stood up. “One last thing.”Alex looked at him curiously. James pulled out the moonstone from his pocket and held it out to her. Alex took the stone and frowned. He had kept the stone safe after they had retrieved it from Katherine, and he was supposed to send it back to the Council for safekeeping.“You kept it?”He nodded. “I thought that sending it off might be premature. Kind of glad I stuck to that now. We wouldn’t want Renee using it against us somehow.”Alex put the moonstone into her pocket. “No, we wouldn’t.”James let himself out, and Alex watched him go. She was glad she could still count on James; no matter how she felt about Elijah, James would always be special to her. James had also been smart enough to keep the moonstone. Alex took a moment to hide the stone, sealing it in the bottom drawer of her dresser. No one would be able to get into it and take it, so she felt comfortable leaving it there to meet up with Elijah. He had agreed to meet her in her favourite place.As Alex walked down the stairs to head out, Stefan walked in. He nodded at her politely, waiting for her to step out of his way before he headed upstairs to see Elena. But Alex stopped at the bottom of the stairs and kept him there.“Everything okay?” asked Stefan.Alex nodded. “Yeah, I just wanted to say something to you, if you can spare a sec.”“Of course.”Alex smiled and said, “I just wanted to apologise. From the day I showed up, I know I’ve been difficult.”Stefan smirked. “That is a word for it.”“I understand it now, what you share with Elena, and I’m glad she has you.”“Thank you.”“But even though I won’t hold your nature against you anymore, I still stand by my original intention of killing you if you hurt her.” Alex pointed her finger and nudged his chest.Stefan nodded. “I would let you.”“Good.” *** The sun had disappeared behind dark clouds that had rolled in as Alex drove towards the field. The air smelt like rain, and Alex couldn’t stop herself from inhaling the fresh scent as she walked through the grass. It was likely she was about to get very wet, but she didn’t care. A little water never hurt anyone.She reached the pond and smiled when Elijah appeared behind her suddenly and wrapped his arms around her waist. Alex closed her eyes and relaxed into his embrace as he kissed along her neck.Elijah asked, “How did it go?”Alex sighed and said, “They all believed me.” It was something she was extremely grateful for. The idea that any of them might have turned against her had worried her.He squeezed her waist. “That’s good.”She nodded and turned around to face him. “It is. And then I rang Renee, and she didn’t even deny it.”Elijah led her closer to the tree that she normally sat at. “The truth is out. There is no use in her lying to you.”Alex nodded and waited as he sat down before letting him pull her onto his lap. “I know. But the way she spoke to me, it was like I didn’t know her at all.“People can wear many masks.” Elijah’s hand rested on her thigh, his thumb slowly stroking.Alex leant her head against his shoulder. “Yeah, but Renee wasn’t just anyone. She found me when I was at a point where I was falling apart. I had no idea what to do and was scared that my magic was going to kill someone. Renee helped me accept who I was, how to use my magic. She was my mentor, my friend.”“It is okay to be upset about losing her.”She frowned. “Is it? She has actively participated in destroying witches because they think differently.” Renee had willingly turned against her own kind. The Council’s whole deal was trying to keep everyone safe from vampires, but they were the ones it seemed that they should be afraid of.Elijah said, “I’ve seen what fear and power do to people. Even the best of us all can become corrupt.”“Which sucks,” she mumbled.Elijah nodded and pressed his lips to her shoulder. Alex was glad to be with Elijah, his touch was comforting, and she found that talking with him always helped clear her mind. But it was hard to completely relax with how much was changing. Alex didn’t know what to face first when she was up against Klaus, Renee, and in some ways, Mikael. Friends were becoming enemies, and enemies were becoming friends. It was too much; she just wanted it to stop.“Are you okay?” asked Elijah.Alex took his hand in one of hers and said, “I don’t really know. I am trying to save my sister from your brother, which is complicated enough on its own, while also having to deal with your father, whom I woke to try and get him to kill your brother, and while trying to deal with that, I learn that I’ve been a part of a group of witches that have committed worst acts then most vampires have.”“That doesn’t sound complicated at all.”Alex glanced up at Elijah, a twinkle of laughter in her face. “Was that sarcasm?”Elijah smirked. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”Alex released his hand to take his face, a small laugh falling from her. “It better be, or you’re in trouble.”Elijah whispered, “I already am.”Kissing Elijah made everything stop. For the few moments that their lips touched, Alex could stop thinking about every single crazy thing in her life and focus on something new and exciting. This development didn’t have all the life-ending drama that everything else did.The raindrop on her head didn’t make Alex break the kiss; she only deepened it. Elijah pressed his tongue into her mouth; Alex tangled her fingers in his hair and shifted herself on his lap. Elijah groaned and slid a hand beneath the material of her shirt to caress her stomach. It grew hotter as Alex moved to straddle Elijah’s waist, her hands tugging at the buttons of his shirt, her body flushing with need as his hands pushed up her top and slid beneath her bra. Alex gasped as she felt the light rain touch her bare chest as Elijah pulled her shirt and bra over her head. He broke their kiss to taste her neck, his mouth pausing over her pulse point to suck and nibble at the skin, making Alex’s body wiggle in his lap and press against his growing problem. Alex whined as Elijah’s mouth found her breast; he sucked her hard nipple into his mouth and groaned as he used his tongue to play with the small nub. Alex’s back arched, and her head fell back.The crack of thunder made Alex jump, slightly startled, but the movement of her body made Elijah’s hands tighten. Her rocking hips were pressing firmly against his tracked cock, and the friction of her body was only making him harder. The rain started to fall harder, and Elijah’s mouth released her breast. He said, “Perhaps we should find somewhere dry?”Alex nodded, feeling a little unfocused. “My car…road.”Elijah grasped her body and lifted her up with ease. The world around them turned blurry for a moment, and then Alex felt the cold metal of her car pressed against her back. She gasped at the sudden change.Alex dropped one hand from Elijah’s neck to dig in her pocket for her keys but struggled to grasp them when Elijah’s mouth attacked her breast again. Her head fell back against the car roof, making a small thumb sound. Elijah let out a small chuckle before rolling the nipple with his teeth. He also took the keys from her hand and unlocked the car.Elijah laid Alex down across the backseat, his hands going to her jeans and pulling them down her legs along with her panties. He stuffed them in the footwell behind the front seat along with her shoes before climbing into the car on top of her.Her lips met his in a hard kiss, full of teeth and saliva. Alex pushed at Elijah’s clothes, getting his wet jacket off, along with his shirt before reaching between them to unbutton his pants. Elijah grunted as her hand ran across his covered cock as she pushed at the material; his teeth bit her lower lip as he pushed his hips against her hand. Alex got her hand beneath Elijah’s briefs and grasped his cock; she stroked his length as Elijah used one of his hands to push his pants and brief down low enough that there was now nothing between them.“Fuck me,” Alex gasped, lining his cock up to her entrance.“With pleasure.”Elijah kissed her again as he thrust his length into her. They both moaned as his length burrowed its way in, Alex grasping at Elijah’s shoulders as he stretched her. His second thrust found her special nerves, making her toes tingle and her back arch. Alex lifted her knees higher, her leg hooking around Elijah’s waist and pressing her foot against his ass to try and push him deeper.It was the roughest they had been with one another. Elijah’s teeth nipped at her skin, his hands digging into her hips, his cock pounding that spot over and over. Alex’s nails were dug into Elijah’s shoulders, his skin breaking under the pressure.“Alex,” Elijah grunted into her ear.One of his hands found her clit, and he pressed right against it when she needed it. Her eyes rolled back, and her walls clenched around his hot length.“Fuck, Elijah!”A loud growl ripped through Elijah’s chest, and she felt his teeth on her throat, the two sharp points of what she knew were his fangs were pressing against her throat, but they didn’t break the skin. Alex’s centre pulsed around Elijah as she found her release, the scraping of his fangs sending her over, with him following shortly after.Alex reached for Elijah’s face, lifting his mouth from her neck. As she took in his face, she was the dark veins beneath his eyes slowly fading.“I’m sorry.” He tried to turn his face away, but Alex held firm.“Don’t hide from me,” she said. Her thumbs traced the veins until his vampire visage was gone. “Never hide from me.”Elijah nodded and kissed her. “I just don’t want to scare you.”Alex smirked. “I’d like to see you try.”Elijah nipped at her lip. “Some of the things I’ve done would shock you.”Alex squinted her eyes. “Are you trying to make me run away?”“No. I just don’t want you to think I’ve kept anything from you.”“Elijah, I’m not naive. You’ve lived a very long time, but I can’t hold your past against you, especially when you aren’t holding mine again me.”“And what have you done that is so terrible?”“I’ve hunted vampires. Burned them alive. Tortured them for information.” Alex moved her hand along his shoulder.Elijah said, “I’ve slaughtered thousands. Took what I wanted and cared for no one but myself.”“Now that’s not true. You did what you did for family.” Alex touched his jaw. Even if his family were vampires, she had seen the love in his eyes when he talked about them. The pain from missing them weighed heavy on his heart, and she couldn’t imagine what they had endured for a thousand years.“And I would do it again,” he said.Alex smiled. “I would too. For my family…for you.”Elijah kissed her, his hands cupping her sides. His body started to move again, his cock growing firmer inside her. “And I you, elskan min.”Alex smiled at the word, not having a chance to ask its exact meaning but feeling the affection behind it as his thrusts grew harder and his tongue entered her mouth.

  What Hurts Most
Alex stood near the town centre and searched the crowd for signs of anyone. The whole place was empty, the picnic tables, lit bonfires and half-eaten food were the only signs that anyone had minutes before been celebrating Founder’s Day. After Alex had spoken with James, she had called the Sherrif to evacuate the town. It had been challenging to convince Liz to get everyone out at the last second, but after telling her that the oldest vampires in existence was spotted in the town square, she stopped arguing.When she had been let past the blocked off roads by one of the deputies, she found herself alone. James hadn’t contacted her about Elena, and the girls hadn’t reached out to her. Elijah and Mikael were also still radio silent. Alex had tried reaching out to sense anyone, but she could feel another witches magic, it was interfering with her own.“Why are you hiding, Klaus?” she called out. “Are you scared?” Taunting a thousand-year-old vampire probably wasn’t the best idea she had ever had. But Klaus was a hunter, and no hunter could stand one of his prey taunting him.“More like observing.” Klaus appeared in front of her and flashed a menacing grin. Seeing him in his actual body was odd. She had for a moment expected Alaric’s face to appear, but now she could look in the grey-blue eyes that rippled with desires. “It is easy to see why Elijah is so taken with you. You are certainly a sight to behold.” A small chuckle fell from his lips.“Have you been stalking me?” Alex asked. She titled her head and tried to keep herself calm. The longer Klaus was focused on her, the longer James had to get Elena somewhere safe and the more time Elijah or Mikael to show up.“Not you, per se. My brother has been avoiding me, and I was curious about what was keeping his attention. I’m not surprised that a beauty like you captured his eye.” Klaus smiled and held his hands behind his back. “And you are also a witch; Elijah has a tendency to fall for your kind.” He makes a disapproving sound with his mouth before his smile turns into a sinister grin. “But it never does end well.”“My relationship with your brother has nothing to do with this.” Alex felt uncomfortable under his gaze. She also didn’t trust anything that came out of his mouth. Elijah had warned her that he enjoyed messing with people’s minds.“That isn’t entirely true, love.” He winked and flashed forward. Before Alex could react, his hand was wrapped around her throat, and his other hand slid into her jacket pocket. He pulled her phone out and smiled. “Your sister has this nasty habit of slipping away from me. She seems to have all of these people willing to save her. Vampires, witches, humans.” Klaus squeezed her throat tighter. “And then you, her loving sister and powerful witch. You also mess everything up. And you killed my witches.” He growled and threw her across the square and into the trunk of a tree.Alex cried out as her back impacted the wood. Nothing was broken, but she would have a nasty bruise.“Do you think Elena would come running if it meant saving your life?” Klaus asked. He put Alex’s phone to his ear and smiled. “Hello love,” he said. “I am here, enjoying these bonfires with your big sis. I was just telling Alexandra that it would make things so much more enjoyable if you were to join us; otherwise, I’m going to reenact the Salem witch trials by burning your sister alive. Do you understand me?” Klaus face lit up in a bright smile. “Brilliant, see you soon.” Klaus hung up her phone and threw it towards her. “Looks like we will have some company.”Alex glared at him and pushed herself up. Her whole body screamed out in pain, but she pushed through it and threw her magic at him. Her hand flew out in front of her and Klaus flew across the town square and into one of the benches, breaking it into pieces. “If you think,” Alex gasped in pain. “What I’m going to let you hurt Elena, then you are dead wrong.” With another wave of her arm, Klaus flew into a tree. Alex smiled as Klaus let out a groan.“Alexandra!”Relief filled Alex as she turned to Elijah. His arms wrapped around her, and she instantly faded into his touch.“Are you okay?” he asked.Alex groaned. “Bastard threw me against the damn tree. My side is killing me.”Elijah pulled her against him a little tighter and yelled, “You agreed that you wouldn’t hurt her.”Alex looked up at him, confused. “What?” she asked.“I said I wouldn’t kill her, big difference brother.” Klaus walked back towards them and sat down on the edge of the fountain in the centre of the square. “Besides, she gave just as good as she got.” Klaus tugged a piece of wood from the chair she had thrown him into out of his arm. “Shame.” Klaus looked at the hole in his shirt. “I like this shirt.”“Niklaus, this what no part of our deal.” Elijah pulled Alex behind him and moved towards Klaus.“Elijah, I was never one for your plans. Besides, I was enjoying myself. Now relax. Soon, Elena will join us, and we can all be on our way. Tomorrow is the full moon, and then I will give you what you asked, alright?” Klaus crossed his arms.“Elijah? What is going on?” Alex reached out for Elijah’s arm and turned him towards her.He looked down at her with heavy eyes and sighed. “I had to make a deal with Niklaus.”Alex frowned. “What type of deal?”“He—”Klaus interrupted. “Elijah is doing the brotherly thing and is going to help me break my curse. For his assistance, I gave him my word that you would keep your life, even though you have been a massive pain, and I would reunite him with our family.” Klaus smiled and stood.Alex shook her head. “Elijah, you wouldn’t, no. You said that…” Alex let go of Elijah’s hand and took a step back.“Alexandra, I didn’t want to. But there is a way that this can work out. You will be safe and we—”“No!” Alex shouted. Her magic reacted to the anger that flared inside her, and it threw both Elijah and Klaus away from her. “You lied to me.” Alex clenched her fists.“Alexandra, please.” Elijah stood up and stepped towards her. His eyes were pleading for her to understand, to forgive him. But he was no better than everyone else who had lied to her.“I trusted you, you promised to help me keep Elena safe. And now, you are going to let him kill her. Neither of you will get near her ever again, not while I’m still breathing,” yelled Alex.“That breathing matter can be dealt with, love.” Klaus sniggered.“Niklaus, please shut up.” Elijah snapped at him.“Yes, please do shut up Niklaus. The adults don’t wish to listen to such an insolent child.”Klaus spun around to face Mikael. His smug appearance faded, and fear lit up his face. “You!” Klaus growled.“Me.” Mikael chuckled. “How fortunate that we were able to meet up in this…” Mikael took a second to observe his surroundings. “quaint little town.”“I thought you were locked up in some tomb, rotting?” asked Klaus.Mikael nodded. “I was. You can thank Miss Gilbert here for waking me up. She believed that we should be able to resolve our differences sooner or later.”“You haven’t been able to kill me before, why do you think today will be any different?” Klaus held out his hands. “Give it your best shot, father.”“So eager to die.”“Not to die, to be rid of you so that I can become who I truly am.”“And then what? Live alone for eternity with no one by your side. Nobody cares about you anymore, boy! You have no one loyalty, even Elijah has completely given up on you. He only stands by your side to protect the woman he loves and hopes that you will give him his siblings back.”Hearing Mikael declare that Elijah loved her felt like someone stabbing her with a knife. If he loved her, he would never have betrayed her. She couldn’t stop from the tears building up in her eyes though, seeing how Elijah stood beside Klaus, both of them facing his father showed her that no matter how she felt and what he said, family was family.“And what do you have? I don’t see anyone flocking to your side.” Klaus took a step towards Mikael.Mikael smiled. “I don’t need loyalty, all I need is to find those who want you to die just as much as I do.”A blur flew past Alex and smacked into Klaus’ back. Damon drove a stake through Klaus’ but missed his heart. Both vampires tumbled to the ground as Klaus cried out. Damon tried to grab the stake to push it into his heart but was thrown off of Klaus by Elijah.Elijah reached to pull the stake from Klaus, but Alex used her magic to fling him away from everyone. She held him down and yelled, “Mikael, now!”Mikael smiled and flashed beside Klaus. He grasped the stake and twisted it in Klaus’ gut. “I have been waiting a thousand years to do this.”Klaus cried out and glared at him. “I will see you in hell.”Mikael yanked the stake out of Klaus’ chest, and as he swung down his arm to kill him, he froze.Alex turned to see Renee standing beside her car, the engine running and door opened. Her hand pointed towards Mikael, her magic freezing him in place. What was she doing? Alex let go of Elijah and yelled, “Renee! What are you doing?”Klaus took advantage of Mikael’s frozen form and pulled the white oak stake from his hand. He plunged it into his father’s chest.“No!” Alex cried.Mikael burst into flames and his body crumbled to the ground. He was dead. The white oak stake was gone. Alex watched Mikael burn for a moment before turning to face Renee. “Why?” she screamed.Renee smiled. “Just a taste of what turning your back on the Council looks like.” She slipped back into her car and drove off.Alex couldn’t believe this; Mikael was dead, Elijah had betrayed her and Renee was showing her that this was only just the beginning. She found it hard to stay upright, Alex wanted to fall to her knees and cry, but she couldn’t. She wasn’t finished yet.“Alex!” Elena’s voice called out, and she saw her sister running to her.“Elena, no!”

    “Mikael, who invited you to this party?” asked Klaus. His jaw was clenched, and his body stiff.Mikael glanced at Alex before casually stepping towards Klaus. He said, “You can thank Alexandra for my arrival. It seems she wishes to kill you almost as much as I do.”Klaus scoffed. “Funny thing about that; you’ve had a thousand years to kill me, and yet you still haven’t managed to do so.”Mikael sneered. “Perhaps that would be because of your cowardly nature. Instead of standing up and fighting me, you’d run away any time I grew too close. You fled the America’s for Europe, and then once you had travelled to every inhabited section, you returned to your beloved New Orleans. Once again, fleeing instead of standing and fighting for the place you called a kingdom.”“I sort to protect my family—”“You’re family?” Mikael scoffed. “My children still view you as their brother when you are nothing more than a mongrel. If I’d known you were the bastard son of another, I would have ended you the minute you were expelled from your mother’s womb.”“No doubt it would have saved you much trouble if you had done so, but alas. Here we are.”“Yes, here we are. You are still as weak as you were as a human. Just as scared, just as cowardly.” Mikael smirked. “Would you like to prove me wrong, Niklaus? Are you finally ready to face me, or shall I run this stake through your back as you flee?”Klaus’ hand trembled, and he shouted, “My whole life, you’ve underestimated me! Treated me like I was nothing, but you were wrong. I no longer need you to tell me what I am, for I already know. And once I break the curse and become my true self, no one will ever doubt my strength again.”“You are still so naive.”Mikael charged towards Klaus, throwing him into the bleaches in a mess of blurred movements. Alex took the attack to rush across the gym towards Liz, who was dazed and barely conscious of the room around her. Alex could hear them grunting, and the crashing as Mikael and Klaus threw themselves at one another, but she tried to ignore them and focus on Liz. She waved her hands over the cuffs, saying a quick unlocking spell to open them, before lifting Liz’s arm over her shoulder and pulling her to her feet.Alex watched as Mikael managed to knock Klaus to the ground, but the stake wasn’t in his hand. Klaus used his foot to send Mikael flying across the room before glancing towards her. Klaus pushed himself up and charged towards her. Alex lifted her hand to react, but another blur appeared in front of her, cutting off Klaus’ path and throwing him backwards. It took a moment for Alex to recognise Elijah’s back.The doors to Alex’s right were thrown open, and Jonas and Luka walked in, both of them chanting their hands raised. Klaus grasped his head, letting out a pained scream as Elijah turned to look at Alex.He asked, “Are you alright?”Alex nodded. “I’m fine. I’m not sure what Klaus did to Liz, though.”Elijah frowned. “Caroline is waiting outside; take Liz to her. I’ll deal with this.”Alex wanted to argue, she didn’t want to leave him, but someone needed to get Liz away from all this. She nodded. “Be careful.”Elijah smiled softly. “Always.”Alex pulled Liz toward the door and away from another loud crash. As Alex pulled her through the hall, Liz groaned and shook her head.“What…whass…” Liz tried to speak.“It’s okay, Liz,” said Alex. “I gotcha.” She pulled her down the hall and paused when she saw Caroline, who was pacing back and forth.“Mum!” cried Caroline. She rushed forward, taking Liz from Alex. “What happened?”Alex sighed. “I don’t know if Klaus did anything before I arrived, but she seems okay, physically.”Caroline frowned. “I’m going to take her to the hospital.”Alex nodded. “I need to get back.”Caroline disappeared with a flash, leaving Alex to turn back to the gym. She rushed back towards the doors and charged through them to find another person had joined them. Another witch, a young woman, held her hands to Luka’s head. Alex reacted and threw her hand out, sending the witch stumbling backwards. Luka slumped to the ground, not moving.“Luka!” cried Jonas. He had just thrown Klaus away from Elijah, who Klaus had pinned to the wall, beside an unconscious Mikael. Jonas rushed across the gym to his son, falling to his knees. “My boy, please.” He grasped Luka’s shoulders and shook him.With no hesitation, the young woman stood up as she moved towards Luka and Jonas.“Great, how could you?” yelled Jonas. “He was your brother.”Greta scoffed with remorse on her face. “I don’t have a brother. Or a father.” She held up her hand, but Alex stopped her. Alex threw Greta across the gym, slamming her body into the far wall.A loud cry caught Alex’s ear. She turned to see Elijah on the floor, Klaus’ hand around his throat. Alex moved towards them; holding out her hand, she threw Klaus off Elijah, who gasped and sat up. Before she could speak, Alex felt her body move. She was propelled across the floor, her legs collapsing beneath her. She slid back until she hit the bottom of the bleachers. Alex cried out as pain radiated through her back.“Alexandra.” Elijah’s voice sounded through the room. He flashed over to her, one hand cupped the back of her head, the other her side.“I’m okay,” she said, grabbing his arm.Elijah pulled her up to her feet, and they turned back towards Klaus, who stood in front of Jonas, Greta at his side. He smirked at Elijah as he grabbed Jonas’ head and snapped his neck. The crack made Alex jump slightly. Elijah squeezed Alex against his side.“It seems your witches weren’t as good as you thought…brother,” mocked Klaus. He chuckled. “Maybe your Alexandra isn’t as powerful as her grandmother?”Alex frowned at the mention of Nadia. Elijah had never mentioned them knowing each other. Then again, he may not have. It seemed Klaus liked to know things; it wouldn’t be far fetched that he had been keeping a close eye on his brother when they were separated.“You know nothing,” said Elijah.Klaus smirked. “I know everything.”Elijah charged towards Klaus as Alex turned towards Greta. Greta struck first, trying to throw Alex back again, but Alex was ready for her. Shouting out a blocking spell, Alex slammed her hand against the ground, making it shake beneath Greta’s feet. The whole room shook, surprising Elijah and Klaus, but it gave Alex the chance to rush forward – the ground staying steady beneath her – to grab Greta. She grabbed the young witches face and knocked her out with a sleeping spell. Greta’s eyes rolled back into her head as the room stopped shaking and slumped to the ground.Elijah was thrown back again but Klaus, who seemed even angrier. He turned towards Alex and said, “I think I’ve had enough of your interference, love.” He charged towards Alex, his hand going for her throat, but it stopped short.Klaus let out a choked groan and looked down. The white oak stake was piercing his lower abdomen. Mikael grabbed Klaus’ shoulder and threw him away from Alex, tearing the stake from him as he did.“I think we’ve all had enough of you, Niklaus.” Mikael stalked towards Klaus, who tried to push himself up onto his feet. “Any last words?” Mikael lifted the white oak stake up, reading to plunge it into Klaus’ chest. But his hand stopped.Elijah was suddenly beside Mikael. He grasped the hand that held the white oak and put himself between Mikael and Klaus. Alex stared confused as Elijah stopped Mikael from killing him.“What are you doing?” asked Mikael.Elijah swallowed, his face seeming uncertain.Before any answer could be given, Klaus was back on his feet, ripping the stake from Mikael’s hand, surprising them all as he struck the white oak stake into Mikael’s chest. Mikael let out a howl of pain, his eyes growing wide as his skin quickly turned pale and black veins appeared over his skin. He sunk to his knees before falling back onto the ground, flames bursting forth from around the white oak stake, burning the stake and Mikael’s body.Klaus took a step back from Mikael’s burning body and smiled. “Now, that was unexpected.” He chuckled and brushed back his hair. “Have a change of heart, brother?”Elijah turned from Mikael to look at Klaus. His face was hard, but he looked torn.Alex couldn’t believe what had just happened. Elijah had told her that he wanted Klaus dead, that he would do anything, and she had been stupid enough to believe him. Red hot fury filled Alex’s stomach; she felt sick as her stomach twisted as every single moment she had shared with Elijah flashed through her mind. She had fallen for him, a vampire. Alex had gone against everything she had known for him, and now he had betrayed her.Glaring at the two Originals, Alex knew she couldn’t let it go. Raising her hand, Alex turned to Klaus, who felt the effect of her spell and turned to her. She pushed more power behind it and made Klaus cry out, his eyes clenching, and he cried out.“Alexandra—”Alex glared at Elijah, keeping her magic trained on Klaus. “You lied to me.”Elijah shook his head.“Why would you stop, Mikael? Klaus was supposed to die; that was the plan. You agreed!” she shouted.Elijah took a step forward.Alex reacted by throwing him back. Her magic slipped from Klaus long enough for him to rush towards her. He grabbed her around the throat, his hand cutting off her air supply. Alex took both her hand and dug her nails into the skin on his wrists.Klaus smirked. “Elijah may hate me, little witch. But family is the most important thing to him.”Alex glared at him and forced every ounce of strength into hurting Klaus. He groaned painfully as her magic ran into him. His grip on her neck weakened and gave Alex the breath to start her chant. The desiccation spell wasn’t meant to be done in such a way, but Alex couldn’t waste this chance. The words fell from her lips, the strength drying Klaus’ body slowly.“What—are—you—do—ing?” gasped Klaus. He dropped to his knees as his skin started to turn white.Alex swallowed; her own heart was slowing as she channelled the spell through herself. She would have to stop her own heart for this to work. She would die, but it would stop Klaus from hurting Elena. “Making sure you don’t get what you want!” she said, pushing more power behind the spell.Dark veins appeared on Klaus’ arms, his body slumping further to the ground as Alex felt her own legs grow weak. She was trying to keep herself standing; she needed him to desiccate to the point he couldn’t recover from before her heart stopped completely. She was close, so very close.“Alex!” Elijah appeared beside her. His arms grasped her waist as she stumbled. “Alex, stop! You’re killing yourself.” He moved them down to the ground, Alex making sure to hold on tight to Klaus’ wrists.Alex took a sharp breath, her body struggling to focus on the spell any longer. “I had too,” she whispered.Elijah shook his head, his lips against her ear. “No, please. This is my fault. Stop, please.”Alex tried to keep her eyes open, but darkness swallowed her. The last thing she felt was Elijah’s lips pressed against her head.
  
    Chapter Text
    The dark felt like a heavy weight. One that she had to push through so that she could find her way out. For awhile, Alex wondered if this is what it was like after death. A void of nothingness, but that couldn’t be right. She understood enough about the otherside to know it was a black void. She should be with her family, her fellow witches.Alex found pushing against the darkness lightened the weight she felt on herself. The more she pushed, the brighter the space seemed to become until she heard the sounds of mumbled voices. The sounds were indistinguishable, but she could tell they were female. Alex could always feel the presences of those she could hear and they were familiar; her family.Alex started to push harder, wanting the darkness to disappear and to find the voices, to find her family. Then she could hear Elena. The words were still slightly muffled, but Alex knew it was her sister’s voice. She caught words like ‘please’ and ‘wake up’. She also thought she could hear a soft sob.Using what strength Alex could muster she pushed herself forward, the darkness burst into a bright light which engulfed her and then everything went dark again. Alex felt confused for a moment but then she felt her senses reconigses the feeling of a bed beneath her, a pillow under her head, and the weight of a blanket over her body. She could fell her heart beat and the sound of her own breath and knew that all she needed to do was open her eyes.Alex blinked a few times as the room came into focus. The light source in the room was from a lamp standing in the corner. Beside that was Elena, asleep in the window seat with her journal rested on her lap. The curtains behind Elena were open, showing the dark evening sky and the quiet of the house around her told Alex everyone else was in bed.Shifting, Alex moved her arms to push herself up. Her body was heavy and sore, and she believed that she would have no trouble falling back asleep if she settled back down, but there was no time for sleep.Alex had lost consciousness in the gym, Elijah holding onto her as she had desiccated Klaus. She had no idea if the spell had been successful, Klaus had been close to dead before she had passed out, but she was also still breathing. It was possible that James or Bonnie had been able to restart her heart, but she needed to know for sure what had happened. She also really needed to go to the bathroom.Throwing off the blankets, Alex tried not to stir Elena. She walked across the room to her bathroom and relieved herself before looking at herself in the mirror. She looked like death. Her skin was pale, dark circles under her eyes, and her hair looked lifeless. Alex glanced at the shower longingly but knew her legs wouldn’t let her stand long enough, so she turned on the water to have a bath.As the steam from the bath filled the room, the bathroom door swung open and a panicked Elena faced her.“Hi,” mumbled Alex, rubbing her face as she sat on the edge of the bath as the water ran.“Seriously?” snapped Elena.Alex frowned. “What?”“Don’t you play dumb. You almost killed yourself. You don’t get to just try and end your own life and then disappear from your sick bed and scare me again and then greet me with a ‘hi’.” Elena crossed her arms over her chest.Alex sighed. “I didn’t want to kill myself but I’d run out of options.”“That’s bullshit and you know it.”“Elijah betrayed me. He stopped Mikael from killing Klaus, right when we were about to be rid of Klaus forever, you were about to be safe, Elijah stopped Mikael and then let Klaus stake Mikael instead. Leaving us down one Original Hunter and destroying the white oak stake since it burned along with Mikael’s body.”“Elijah stopped him?” Elena looked confused.“Yeah. So much for trusting him.” Alex buried her face into her hands and brushed back her hair. “So I’m sorry that I scared you, but would you mind letting me take a bath. I would like to not look like a ghost.”Elena nodded, a dumbstruck look still clouding her face. “Okay. I’ll get you something to eat while you clean up.” She stepped out of the bathroom and closed the door.Alex reached over to turn off the taps and pulled off the clothes she had been left in. She carefully lowered herself into the tub, her body sliding down until she was completely submerged. Letting the water cover her face, Alex held her breath for a few moments as the moments of Elijah’s actions flashed before her.Elijah had fort Klaus, trying to knock him down. He had tried to protect her and they had stood side by side. This man, this vampire was supposed to be different. She had let herself fall in love with an Original Vampire thinking that she had been wrong all along.Pulling herself up, Alex took a breath and pushed the water from her face before resting her head against the tub. She swallowed the lump in her throat and blinked to try and stop the tears but it seemed she couldn’t.Alex didn’t want to believe it but what Klaus had said was right, family mattered to Elijah, she had seen then when he had told her about his family. His family matter to him, even Klaus. No matter what he had done, no matter how much Elijah thought he hated Klaus, he couldn’t let him die.The sob wracked her body as the tears started to fall. She had been a idiot and let herself be used. She should have trusted her initial thoughts, vampires were monsters, but it seemed that witches were also. Hell, every single supernatural creature was probably rotten. Even her. *** Alex sat in the bath water until it turned cold. She had cried, washed her hair, cried, washed her body and then cried one last time before climbing out. She dried her hair thoroughly with her towel before running her brush through it, and then she walked back into her bedroom wrapped in her towel. Elena was sitting on the bed, a plate of food on a tray, as she walked out. The look in Elena’s eyes told Alex that she knew she had heard Alex crying, but Alex didn’t want to talk about that.She pulled on some clean clothes before sitting back down on the bed and looking at the sandwich that Elena had made for her. Alex took a bite and swallowed before she asked, “What happened at the school?”Elena frowned, then said, “I don’t know everything. Caroline said you got Liz out and then the next thing Elijah arrived on the doorstep with you in his arms. He looked distraught and only said that you had tried to desiccate Klaus.”Alex tensed as Elena mentioned Elijah’s display of emotion. She asked, “Tried? So it didn’t work.”“I’m not sure.” Elena fiddled with a thread on the bed sheet. “Elijah laid you down in here and said he had to go. We haven’t seen or heard from him since then, and there has been no word from Klaus.”Alex nodded. Elijah had dropped her here, probably one final act of pitty for the pathetic human he had fooled before returning to his brother. She would need to reseal the house to keep him out of it and away from Elena.She finished the sandwich and put the plate on her side table before climbing off the bed. Elena didn’t move but watched her. The questions that Alex knew she wanted to ask her heavy over the both of them.Alex said, “Just ask me.”Elena sighed. “You said Elijah betrayed you.”“I did. He saved Klaus.”“Can you blame him?”Alex spun around and glared at Elena. She couldn’t believe what she had just heard come out of her mouth. “What?”“We all want to stop Klaus for one reason, but Elijah’s reason is a lot more complicated. It isn’t just because he wants to break the curse. Their relationship is the result of a thousand years,” explained Elena. “They are brothers, even after everything they had done to one another, or Klaus has done to them, Elijah will always want to keep his little brother safe. Even if Klaus keeps hurting him.”Alex wanted to scream. She wanted to throw something, to break something. It should have been expected that Elijah wouldn’t really want to kill Klaus. For every reason that Elena had said and more.“I should have know better,” said Alex.Elena frowned. “What do you mean?”“I told you all that vampires were not to be trusted. They are selfish creatures and do nothing unless it benefits themselves. I should have trusted that.” Alex ran her fingers through her hair. “Instead, I let you all cloud my judgement. I let myself believe that Elijah loved me.” She spat the words ‘loved me’ before grasping the closet thing, a pillow from the window seat and throwing it across the room.Elena climbed off the bed and moved across the room to grabbed Alex’s hands. Fresh tears fell down Alex’s cheeks as Elena pulled her in and hugged her firmly. She hushed Alex and they both sunk to the floor as Alex’s whole body trembled.There weren’t many times where Alex could remember feeling such a way. Her heart felt broken, like pieces were breaking off and turning to ash with every second that she had to accept that Elijah had turned against her. The last time she had felt such a way was at her parents funeral, watching their coffin’s lowered into the ground and having to accept that she would never see them again. Alex would never wish such a feeling on anyone and she just wanted it to stop. ***  Alex had fallen back to sleep with Elena beside her. She had sobbed herself to sleep with Elena holding onto her through every single moment. When Alex woke, her face was sore and dry from the salt of her tears and she was alone. She could hear the life of the house beneath her and the smell of breakfast was floating up the stairs.Sitting up, Alex brushed her fingers through her hair before climbing out of the bed. She grabbed a cardigan from the chair in the corner and made her way downstairs. Alex felt better than she had when she had woken up during the night, but she still felt sluggish and her body felt heavy.Downstairs in the kitchen, Alex found Elena, Stefan, Jenna and James. They all stopped what they were doing as she entered the room, making Alex huff and cross her arms.“I’m fine,” she grumbled.Jenna gave her a warm smile and walked around the counter to hug her. “For which I’m extremely glad of. Don’t do that again.”Alex hugged her aunt, and let out a sigh. “I’ll try.” It wasn’t really a promise Alex could make. She would do whatever it took to protect her family, even if it meant killing herself.“How does your core feel?” asked James. He stepped towards her and held out a cup.Alex took the cup and took a sip. The coffee tasted like heaven and her stomach grumbled with delight. She said, “I haven’t tried to touch it yet, don’t really have the energy for much.”James nodded. “Don’t be surprised if you feel a little lackluster for a few days.”Alex frowned. “I don’t have time to recover. We need to deal with Klaus. The full moon is days away.”“Yes, but Klaus doesn’t have the moonstone or the doppleganger. He can’t do much without either,” said Stefan.“There’s nothing to stop him from kidnapping someone else and threatening to kill them to get what he wants. He took the Sherrif yesterday, but next it could be any of us. And there is every chance that he could get to Elena, she doesn’t have someone with her twenty-four-seven,” explained Alex.Elena frowned. “Klaus can try all he wants. We won’t let him hurt anyone.”Alex sometimes wondered what it would be like if she was as optimistic as Elena was, but in this case she didn’t think it was possible. Someone was going to get hurt, and Alex felt like it was only a matter of time.“Why don’t we get some food into you first and then we can work out what comes, yeah?” suggested Jenna. She rubbed Alex’s shoulder before nudging her towards the table.Alex ate what she was given and finished her coffee. While she enjoyed the coffee, having a second cup following the food, it was the food that had no taste. She sat back in her chair and sipped at her coffee before getting up and walking outside to sit on the porch swing.She sat with her legs pulled up against her chest and her cup off coffee resting on her knees. Alex watched as a few cars drove past and the sound of a dog barking from down the street followed two kids on bikes who road past. She sighed and closed her eyes wanting to shut out the world and she smiled when she felt the familiar warmth of her magic. She clenched her fist closed and opened her eyes as the rush of her magic formed in her hand. Alex opened her fingers and smiled as a small flower grew in the palm of her hand.“I don’t remember the last time you did that.”Alex looked up at James. He stood in the doorway, smiling at her softly.She said, “Just checking.” She blew the flower from her hand and it floated across the porch and out onto the lawn.“Do you want to tell me what really happened? Only got bits and pieces from everyone else.” He moved away from the door and sat beside her on the swing.“Klaus took the Sherrif. I faced off with him and Mikael showed up. While Mikael and Klaus fort I got Liz out, at the same time Elijah showed up with Luka and Jonas. I handed Liz off to Caroline and went back. Greta, Klaus’ witch and Jonas’ daughter showed up, killed Luka and Klaus killed Jonas. Mikael was so close to killing Klaus but Elijah seemed to have a change of heart.” Alex grip tightened on her cup.James frowned. “What did he do?”“He stopped Mikael from killing Klaus. It gave Klaus the opportunity to get the white oak stake from Mikael and then turned it on him. Resulting in Mikael dying and the white oak stake burning along with him.”James dropped his head and clenched his hands together. “Fuck.”“Tell me about it.” Alex finished the rest of her coffee.James sat back against the swing and said, “Elijah brought you back after you tried to desiccate Klaus. He never mentioned any of it.”“Why would he?” Alex clenched the cup. She really wanted to through it at the wall.“From what you told me, things between you two—”“It was a mistake. He tricked me and I should have known better.”James frowned.“What?” she asked. She could see something was sitting on his tongue.“Before Elijah left, he stopped me and said to tell you that he would wait for you to call him. I didn’t really understand what he meant, I thought he’d come back and check on you, but it makes sense now.”“If I call him, it’s only to get him to meet me so I can kill him,” she snapped.“Or maybe you should ask him why he did what he did?”The cup shattered in Alex’s hand. The pieces tumbled to the ground and Alex cringed. Her magic hadn’t reacted that way to her emotions in a long time.“Alex—”“I just need to think,” she said.James nodded and stood. “Take the time you need.”As he walked back inside, Alex sighed and buried her face into her hands. This whole thing was a mess. She felt like a mess and she hated it.

    The phone felt heavy in her hand as she hit dial. When Alex had told James that she needed time to think, she wasn’t sure how she concluded that the best thing to do was to call the vampire that had broken her heart. She watched her phone light up with Elijah’s name before placing it against her ear and listening as it rang once and stopped before the second ring had barely begun.“Alexandra, you’re alright.” Elijah’s voice sounded relieved.A lump formed in Alex’s throat. She didn’t know what she wanted to say. Her heart seemed to thump against her chest and as she clenched her eyes shut Alex’s felt tears well.“Alexandra, I’m so sorry.” His words were soft and his voice cracked. “I thought that Klaus truly had gone too far. I wanted him dead, I really did.”Alex wiped her hand across her cheek, catching a stray tear. “Yet he’s alive while Mikael and the white oak stake are gone.”Elijah cleared his throat. “I wanted Klaus dead up until the very moment I saw that it was going to happen. But in that moment all I could picture was my younger brother pleading with me to help him when our parents cursed him. I saw him lying on the ground, covered in blood after Mikael had beaten him. And I just couldn’t stand aside and let Mikael kill him.”The words were like knives to her chest. Alex felt like she couldn’t find her breath. It hurt worse than anything she could remember feeling. The worst part was that everything that he was saying she could understand. Alex felt like she had failed her siblings before and she wanted desperately to protect them from everything. For Elijah it was the same, even after a thousand years he couldn’t just turn off those instincts to love and protect his family. Even after everything Klaus had done.“I know you are probably furious with me,” said Elijah.“You betrayed me,” snapped Alex.“I know, but I am hoping that you could understand why I did what I did.”“I do.” Her voice was a whisper. “I understand why you saved him. But I can’t forgive you.”“Alex—”“No.” She cut him off. “Klaus wants to break his curse, which means killing Elena. I will die before I let that happen.”Elijah grew silent and she could hear what sounded like something break against something else. His raged breathes travelled down the line and he said, “We can find a way around this.”“No we can’t. It’s Klaus or Elena. There is no middle ground that exists.” Alex swallowed and felt more tears slide down her cheeks. “You’ve chosen your side. You’ll have to live with that.”“Alex—”She ended the call, Elijah’s voice breaking.Alex felt what was left of his heart break and tears fell down her face. She would let herself grieve for just a moment before she would have to wipe her tears and focus on what was to come. *** The Gilbert house was full. Everyone had gathered to discuss the new plan, not that Alex had everything worked out. They didn’t have enough time to waste and the full moon would arrive the next night.Alex stood beside the fireplace in the living room. She was feeling stronger, the ache in her body had faded and her magic seemed to be strong. She had no idea if she was ready to push any limits but she had to be ready to face Klaus again.“Killing Klaus, at this stage, isn’t an option,” said Alex. It infuriated her to admit such a thing, but time was running short.“If we can’t kill him, what can we do?” asked Elena.“You could run,” suggested Jeremy.Elena frowned. “And leave you all behind? I don’t think so.”“Running isn’t really an option,” said Alex. “If Elena was to leave then Klaus would just torture every single person Elena knew until we were all dead.”“Then what do you suggest?” asked Stefan. “Surely you don’t mean to let Klaus kill her.”Alex glared at him and said, “Of course not.”“But you have a plan,” said James.Alex nodded. “Same idea we had for Mikael. We just need to desiccate Klaus and then he can spend his next thousand years sealed in a coffin, until we work out a way to kill him without using a white oak stake.”“And how do you suppose we get close enough without Klaus thinking we are up to something?” asked Damon.Alex didn’t turn around to glare at him. It annoyed her enough that he was standing on the doorstep. Out of all of the vampires that had come into Elena’s life, besides Klaus, Damon was possibly the worst.“I don’t have an exact idea of what we could do, so if anyone has any suggestions as to how we could do that, nows the time to share,” said Alex.Damon’s scoff made Alex tense. She wanted to march over to him and shove a stake into his chest. Maybe not his heart, but she wanted to scare him enough to shut him up. James’ hand came to rest on Alex’s shoulder, and he gave her a look telling her to relax. She took a deep breath to calm down.“What about Elijah?” asked Alaric.Alex crossed her arms and swallowed the vomit that seemed to start to climb up her throat. “Elijah is not our ally. We need to consider he will be fighting against us in all of this.”Alaric frowned. “What happened to wanting to kill his brother?”“It doesn’t matter what happened,” said James, “what does matter is what we do? We need someone to make a blood connection with Klaus to desiccate him, and we need someone else to distract Elijah and his witch.”“Sarah and I can handle his witch,” said Robert.Sarah nodded. “Yeah, I’m in.”“Bonnie, would you be willing to go against Elijah?” asked James.Bonnie nodded. “Absolutely.”“Caroline and James can back you up,” said Alex.James frowned. “I think I should help you.”Alex shook her head. “No. Stefan and Damon can go after Klaus. We can weaken him before desiccating him, and I need to know that Elijah won’t get in the way.”“Once Sarah and I deal with the witch, we can back Alex up,” said Robert.James seemed hesitant but nodded. “Alright.”“Elena, can you ring Caroline and make sure she’s in. I know she’s had issues with Tyler and her mum, but we could use her help,” said Alex.Elena nodded. “Of course. She did say she was coming.”“What do you want me to do?” asked Jeremy.Alex sighed. She knew this question was coming. Jeremy wanted nothing more than to help. He wanted to fight alongside his family to help keep them safe.“I need you to stay here with Jenna and Elena. I need you three all somewhere where I know no one can hurt you,” said Alex.Jeremy frowned. “I’m not sitting this out.”“Yes you are.”“I’m not a child,” he snapped.Jenna walked over and grasped Jeremy’s arm. “Jeremy, you are human. Getting involved in this will only put others in danger.”“Alaric’s human,” he claimed.“Yes, and he is stupid enough to agree to let me stop his heart,” said Alex. “If I didn’t need to do that he would be staying here too.”Jeremy scoffed and tore his arm from Jenna before storming out of the living room. His footsteps on the stairs and the slamming of his bedroom door made Alex groan and rub at the back of her neck.“He will understand,” said Jenna.“I know.”Jenna laid an arm over Alex’s shoulders and hugged her. “How you doing?” she asked.Alex said, “I’m holding myself together.”Jenna gave her shoulders a quick squeeze and said, “I’m sorry things turned to shit.”Alex let out a barked laugh. “Yeah. That seems to happen to all of us.”Elena stood from her seat at the table and looked concerned. “Caroline’s not answering.”“Did you try Tyler?” asked Bonnie.“Yeah, and still nothing,” said Elena.“Maybe they are together?” offered Alaric. “You know.”“Did you try Liz?” asked Alex.Elena shook her head.“Alright, try Liz, and I’ll try a locator spell,” said Alex.James stepped forward. “Let me, you’re still recharging your batteries.”Alex glared at him but didn’t argue.Sarah went upstairs to grab the things from Alex’s room before they laid it out on the dining table. Using the friendship bracelet’s that Caroline had given Elena and Bonnie in middle school, James started the spell. The blood ran across the map for a moment before they faded and stopped.“What does that mean?” asked Bonnie. She looked at James confused.“Their cloaked, or in an area that is cloaked from magic,” said Alex.“Why would they be cloaked?” asked Elena.“Well, Klaus does need a vampire and a werewolf to complete the ritual,” said James.The fear that flashed across everyone’s faces made it evident that they had never considered who else Klaus would kill to break his curse.Alex glared down at the map and said, “We need to find them. Klaus will most likely have a back up vampire and a back up werewolf, but if we can keep him from hurting Caroline and Tyler, that would be a step in the right direction.”“We need to search off the places capable of holding a vampire and werewolf where no one would find them,” said James.Stefan said, “There are a few old wine cellars on the Lockwood property.”Alex nodded. “Take your brother with you.”Stefan nodded and gave Elena a kiss on the top of her head before heading towards the front door.“James, take Robert and go check on Caroline’s mum, the Sherrif. I just want to make sure she is okay,” said Alex.James nodded. “No problem, Sarah you’re staying here.”Sarah frowned from the couch where she sat with Bonnie but didn’t argue.The house quickly grew quiet, leaving Alex to head upstairs to take a break from everyone. Elena was in the living room with Sarah and Jenna, and Bonnie had headed upstairs to try and talk to Jeremy.Alex closed her bedroom door behind her and walked over to lie across her bed. She closed her eyes as she nestled her face into the pillow and let out a shaky breath. She could feel the tears that wanted to fall but she didn’t want to cry over him anymore. Elijah had broken her heart and she felt stupid because of it.Burring her face deeper, she barely heard the buzzing of her phone in her pocket. She huffed before rolling onto her back and pulling it out to see a text message from Elijah. She wanted to throw the phone across the room, but the preview showed Caroline’s name.Alex opened the text.
  Caroline and Tyler are being kept in the tomb beneath the Fell Church.
She frowned. Why are you telling me?Elijah had chosen Klaus, why would he tell her where Elena’s friends were? Unless it was a trap.
  Because I love you, and I regret what I’ve done.
The words broke what Alex had left the walls inside her crumbled. Tears fell down her cheeks as her chest squeezed tightly. Alex tried to take a breath to calm herself but she struggled to take enough air in. Sliding off the bed and onto her hands and knees, Alex let out a painful sob and just let go. There was no holding it in anymore.The door to her bedroom opened with a small click, but Alex didn’t look up. She heard the door close again as she sobbed, and then felt the familiar arms of her sister wrap around her. Alex buried her face into Elena’s neck and let herself cry until her throat was raw and her eyes were dry. It was possibly the weakest moment of her life and she hated it.
  
    Chapter Text
    Alex had stayed in her room, not talking to anyone, and waited to hear back from the others. She had sent messages to both the Salvatore brother’s and James and Robert, letting them all know where Elijah claimed Caroline and Tyler were being held. But once she had managed to stop crying and pull herself together, she took a shower and insisted she needed some time alone.It hadn’t been more than an hour since Elijah’s message, and Alex hadn’t been able to look at her phone since she put it down. The messages to Stefan and James had been her last, and while her phone had buzzed more than once from where it sat on her bedside table, she hadn’t been able to pick it up and check it.Alex sat on the window seat and looked down at the street. It was getting late in the day, and Alex wondered what would happen if they managed to make it through the full moon. What would happen if the full moon passed and Klaus couldn’t break his curse? If he wasn’t put down, then he would go after them all. It all came down to what would happen and if they could succeed.There was doubt, a lot of doubt, in Alex’s mind that they would be able to stop Klaus. The idea of fighting against Elijah made her skin crawl. He wasn’t supposed to be against them; he was supposed to be sitting by her side, encouraging her and comforting her. Instead, she had no idea where he was precisely, only that he didn’t want Klaus dead anymore. It scared Alex that she might come face to face with Elijah; she didn’t know how she would handle that.“Alex!” Elena’s voice echoed from downstairs. “Alex!”Alex pushed away from the window seat and rushed to her door. “What?” she asked.Bonnie was standing beside Elena at the bottom of the stairs; they looked panicked.“It’s Jeremy,” said Elena.Alex frowned.“We were in his room, and I fell asleep,” explained Bonnie. “When I woke up, he was gone.”Alex wanted to scream. Jeremy was impulsive, but he couldn’t be stupid enough to take off now. “Did you try his phone?”Elena gave Alex a look like the answer was obvious. “It just rings.”Alex turned back to her room and walked around her bed to grab her phone. As she picked it up, Jeremy’s name flashed on the screen. She sighed with relief but was ready to yell at him.“Jeremy,” she answered, “where the hell are you!”The soft chuckle made Alex freeze. It felt like someone had pressed ice against her back.“No wonder your little brother looked so distraught when I found him.” Renee’s tone was mocking and full of amusement. “Such a helpless thing; it would have been boring if he didn’t have so much fight in him.”“Where is he?” demanded Alex.“He’s here with me. Safe and sound.”“Alex!” Jeremy call out in the background.“But he will only stay safe and sound if you give me what I want.”“If your oh so powerful, why don’t you just come and take it?”Renee sighed. “Because I want to watch you beg, and when you do that of your own will, I will enjoy it so much more.”“And why would I beg?”“That’s for you to find out.”Alex ground her teeth together. This Renee wasn’t the woman who had mentored her; this bitch was vindictive and power-hungry. How had she ever trusted such a person?“Now, I want you to bring me the moonstone and meet me at the coordinates I send you. You have two hours, or little brother Jeremy starts to learn exactly how unsafe he can be.”The phone call ended with a snap, leaving Alex only moments to let her anger simmer before she stormed towards the stairs. Elena and Bonnie were still standing at the bottom; both looked concerned as they seemed to try and decide what to do.Elena looked at Alex and said, “What are we going to do?”“Renee has Jeremy,” said Alex.“Renee?” asked Elena, confused.Alex sighed. She hadn’t really explained Renee to her family, and she wasn’t really someone she wanted to discuss at all. Not after everything. “She was the woman I reported to at the Council. She has taken Jeremy and is demanding the moonstone.”“Why would she want the moonstone?” asked Bonnie.“So she can hold something over me, probably.” Alex grabbed her car keys from where they sat in the kitchen and moved towards the front door.“I’m coming with you,” said Elena.Alex shook her head and stopped Elena at the door. “No. You are going to stay here, with Jenna and Bonnie. You will call James and let him know where I am going, and you will all stay here where Klaus or Renee can get you. Anyone could be working for them, and I need to know you are safe.”The argument died in Elena’s eyes, and she nodded.“I will get Jeremy.” Alex grasped Elena’s hand and squeezed.“Be careful,” said Elena.Alex smiled softly. “Don’t worry about me. It’s Renee who should be worried.”“Alex, shouldn’t someone go with you?” asked Bonnie.Alex couldn’t deny it would be helpful to have James or Robert, even Sarah, to back her up against Renee, but this was about something a lot more than Renee taking Jeremy.“There’s no time to wait for someone, and I’m not putting you in harm’s way. I’ll be fine.” Alex gave both Bonnie and Elena the biggest reassuring smile she could before she opened the front door. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, making her pause to pull it out to see a message from Jeremy’s phone; it was the coordinates. *** The falls. They were one of Alex’s favourite places in Mystic Falls. They were a big attraction for all locals to come down and have picnics and to party. Alex hadn’t ever thought she’d be pulling up to fight her mentor to save her brother.But here she was.Alex followed the coordinates that Renee had provided and pulled up to the small parking area that led to the trails surrounding the falls. There were no other cars in sight, but Alex could feel the tingle of magic. It wasn’t Renee that she could sense, but it was something she might have done. While Renee considered herself better than humans, she wouldn’t want to risk exposing magic to a mere mortal. It was probably a repelling spell to keep them away.Glaring down at the map on her phone, Alex climbed from her car and headed off down the trail. It seemed Renee had chosen a small picnic area beside the falls. The dirt path crunched beneath her feet as she walked. The echoing silence around Alex made her feel uncomfortable as her car disappeared from sight and the rushing water of the falls reached her. She was truly alone out there.A familiar tingle ran through Alex making her pause. She turned to see a fast-moving blur racing towards her. Any other time Alex had seen a vampire barreling towards her in such a way, she would have reacted quickly, throwing her magic at them and sending them to the ground. But the familiar tingle made Alex freeze, and as the blur stopped in front of her and became clear, she wanted to cry.Elijah looked as next as ever, except the look in his eyes was different. He was barely a foot from her, and Alex couldn’t decide if she wanted to run away or grab him. His mouth opened slightly as if he wanted to say something, but no words came out.They both stood there, staring at one another. Elijah moved first, his hand reaching up to touch her cheek. Alex reacted, her hand grasping Elijah’s with a loud smack. Her jaw tensed, and her hand trembled.“Alexandra.” His voice was soft.“Why are you here?” asked Alex. The words were heavy, and she struggled to look up at him.Elijah swallowed, his face tightening. “Elena called me. She told me what you were doing.”Alex couldn’t believe it. She would yell at Elena later. Why would she call him? They couldn’t trust him. “I don’t need your help.”“You can’t go up against this woman alone. You almost died—”“Yes, I am well aware that I almost died. It was your fault I had to resort to such a measure because you—” Alex ripped her hand away from Elijah and turned her back. Her chest felt constricted, and fresh tears welled in the corner of her eyes.Elijah’s hand came down and grasped her shoulder. Alex spun to smack it off her shoulder; she didn’t want him to touch her. The burn of her skin only reminded her of things that had been a lie. But before she could smack him away, Elijah grasped the back of her neck and pulled her against his chest. He pressed his face into her face, and muffled against her hair, said, “I made a mistake, one that I regret more than anything.”“Then why did you stop Mikael?” Alex cried.“Because Klaus is my little brother. I feel like there has been so much in our long lives that have happened, and I have failed him too many times. If Mikael had killed him, I would forever live with the regret that I had failed to protect him.” Elijah’s hand bunched the bottom of her shirt. The touch of his fingers made Alex shiver. “Please understand. I didn’t want to betray you. I will never let Klaus hurt you or Elena. I swear I will protect you until my last breath.”Alex’s shoulders slumped as his words ran over her. She wanted to hate him and claim that he would suffer the same fate – if not worse – than Klaus. But she did understand. Elijah’s choices made sense, and she couldn’t blame him for wanting to protect her family, could she?Alex was torn about how to respond to him, but she didn’t pull away. She felt Elijah’s lip press against her hair; one of his hands shifted and cupped her cheek, lifting her face from his chest to look up at him. Elijah’s thumb touched her cheek for a moment before it moved along her skin in gentle strokes. The touch burned through her body and made her whole body light up. Alex could remember how it felt to have him caress her whole body, how she had felt so safe and loved in his arms, how right it felt to be connected to him.A tear that slid down her cheek was caught by his thumb.He said, “I hate that I’ve hurt you.”Alex took a shaky breath. There were so many things she wanted to say. She wanted to yell and scream that she hated him, that he had ruined everything, but she also wanted to forgive him. Alex wanted to wrap her arms around him and kiss him; she wanted to tell him how she really felt. All of it terrified her.“I know you might not be ready to forgive me,” said Elijah.Alex slowly shook her head. She lifted her hands to grasp his wrists.“I know that we can work this out. Klaus doesn’t need to die. We can desiccate him, just like you were going to do with Mikael. I will keep him locked in a coffin until Elena’s grandchildren are gone from this world.”She wished it was that simple. “And what happens to the next doppelganger and her family. In another…five hundred years when she’s born, why does she deserve to suffer such a fate?”Elijah frowned. He had no answer to her question because they knew what Klaus would do. He would torment her and then kill her the same way he planned to kill Elena. No one deserved that.“There has to be a way,” he said.Alex shook her head. She took another breath and brought his hands to her lips. She pressed a kiss to his knuckles and said, “I’m sorry, Elijah.” It hurt to pull away from him. “I have to go.” She felt cold as she released his hands and turned to walk towards Renee.Elijah said, “Alex, wait.”Lifting her hand, Alex turned back and looked at Elijah and said, “Prohibere.”Elijah’s body went stiff, his eyes wide in shock.Alex lowered her hand and said, “It will wear off, but I need to deal with Renee on my own.” She took one step back towards Elijah and looked at him with a sad smile. She pushed up on her toes to reach his cheek and pressed a soft kiss before she turned and walked away.
  
    Chapter Text
    The picnic area was open and green. A few picnic benches were spread out around the open space, the large trees creating a nice patch of shade to hide beneath if the sun was too hot. The falls were louder than before, and you could see them through the line of trees, the water falling into the river below that ran together down past the spot.It was a beautiful place, one that Alex could remember visiting with her parents. She had only been about eight or nine at the time, Elena and Jeremy were so young, but she remembered laughter and playing in the water with her dad.But there wasn’t going to be laughter this time.As Alex stepped away from the path, she saw Renee. She was casually leaning against one of the picnic benches, her ankles crossed and a pleased smile on her face. The best way to describe her expression was one of victory. Jeremy was seated near Renee, at the foot of one of the tall pines, his mouth was gagged, and his hands and feet were bound. He didn’t look scared; he looked pissed.Renee noticed Alex and pushed away from the bench to stand directly between Alex and Jeremy. She said, “I do love it when you follow orders.”“Give me my brother,” said Alex.“He’s all yours. But first, I’ll take the moonstone.”“I don’t have it.”“Then you don’t get Jeremy back.”“That’s where you are wrong. I’m taking Jeremy home, and you and I are done. I never want to see or hear from you or the Council again.”“You think that’s it? That you just get to walk away from the Council?” Renee laughed. “No one just walks away. The only way you are ever free from us is if you die.”“From what I understand, my Grandmother had no trouble walking away. Once she found out how sick and twisted you all are, she spent her life trying to help those you destroyed.”“You think we just let her go? Nadia was as naive and reckless as you. She thought she was capable of things that made her better than the rest of us. And I used to believe her. When she was made my mentor, I was so excited. Nadia was one of the best witches around, and her bloodline, the Ravenwood’s, were Council royalty. I felt like the luckiest girl in the world. Up until she turned her back on us, and she abandoned me.”“Nadia was your mentor?”“Yep. For four years, I studied under her and pushed myself to my breaking point because I wanted to show her how good I was. And that she told me that it was for nothing. That everything the Council believed, everything she had taught me, was a lie. And then she was gone.”“She left because the Elders were draining magic from witches.”“Yes, witches who had betrayed their own kind, witches who didn’t deserve to have such abilities. Why would we let those who allow such abominations to walk to earth indulge in such wonder? Their magic is given to those who deserve it.”“You mean to those in power, to keep themselves in power.”Renee smirked. “I won’t deny that the Elders have given themselves strength, but leaders need that strength to lead.”“You are all insane. Corrupted by power.”“No. Not corrupted. Enlightened. I wasn’t sure when I first learned about the syphoning; I didn’t understand the benefits. But when I felt Nadia’s magic rush into me and mix with my own, it was like nothing I could ever imagine.”“They gave you Nadia’s magic?”Renee smile turned dark. A sick twisted look of pleasure made Alex feel sick.“No,” said Renee. “I was sent to find Nadia and either kill her or take her back for judgement. I found her too. Living in New Orleans with a man and a daughter. She said she would come if I left them be, so I did. But she didn’t come quietly, of course. Once she was sure your grandfather and mother were safe enough away, she fort back. But she was slopy and hesitant. Made it easy to pin her down.”Elijah had told Alex that Nadia had disappeared. No one had known where.“No one had ever shown me how to syphon another witches magic. Some are born with the ability, but most witches need a spell. Even then, it’s incredibly difficult to do. But it just seemed to happen. I’d heard the spell, and so I just started chanting.” Renee’s eyes rolled back, and her face lit up. “The rush of her power flooding into me was better than anything I’d ever felt.” She giggled. “Once I’d felt it once, I just wanted more.”“So you drain Nadia of her magic and then handed her off for slaughter?” asked Alex.Renee shook her head. “No. Very few witches survive the syphoning process. Once their magical core is drained completely, they either die or go insane. Nadia died, but not before I promised her that I would make sure that her daughter didn’t make the same mistakes she did.”Alex frowned. She knew very little about her mother or her grandfather. But she didn’t think her mother had ever been a part of the Council.“Your mother, however, never wanted to join the Council. As hard as we tried, she wanted to live a peaceful life, teaching or some bullshit.” Renee rolled her eyes. “When you were born, I thought it best that you be raised by those who would guide you the right way. But your mother was smarter than I thought. She hid you from us and disappeared.”Alex didn’t want to hear anymore. Her family had been destroyed because of Renee and the Council. Nadia had her magic stolen, her mother had fled out of fear leading to her own death, and Alex had grown up not knowing who she was. Only for her to fall into Renee’s hand and let herself become twisted into what the Council had wanted.“Why tell me all this?” asked Alex. “If you plan on killing me, why does it matter?”Renee shrugged. “I suppose it’s that look of pain on your face. It just gives me that extra kick of satisfaction. Also, it makes you drop your guard.”The force came out of nowhere. Alex was thrown from her feet to the side. Her back collided with the side of a bench, which she tumbled over and onto the ground. Alex groaned and clutched at her side.“Don’t think you can win this fight,” called Renee. “I trained you. I know how you fight. I also have the power of four witches flooding through me.” Renee walked around the space, flexing her hands.Alex pushed herself up onto her hands and glared at Renee. She wasn’t going to go down easily. Alex would give this everything she had. “Bring it.”Alex slammed her hand into the ground, sending a tremor towards Renee, who did stumble back a few steps. Alex took her chance to get off the ground and threw a stunning spell towards Renee. Renee smirked and lifted up her hand. A loud crack of sparks bounced off her hand and fell to the ground.“Pathetic.” Renee swung her hand, and the force threw Alex across the ground and smacked her right into the base of a tree. “I expected more from you.”Alex tried to push herself up, but Renee held her against the ground. The force of her magic washed over Alex, constricting her movement and her breath. Alex pushed back against it with enough force that it broke through. She pushed away from the tree as Renee strode towards her across the field but didn’t manage to get up before Renee lifted her hand and clenched her fist. Alex’s body froze. Every single limb locked in place, and Alex couldn’t move from where she knelt.Renee took the last few steps to close the gap between them and said, “Now, I’m going to take your magic and kill you. If you tell me where the moonstone is, I will ensure that your family stays safe. Jeremy and Elena will get to grow up with your loving Aunt Jenna, and Klaus will be dealt with. After all, your desiccation plan was brilliant and will work on all the Originals until we find a way to kill them all.”Alex felt her vocal cords relax.“So, moonstone?”Alex wanted to glare at her back. She couldn’t move her face. “Never,” she snapped.Renee sighed. “Very well.”Renee placed both of her hands on either side of Alex’s head and forced her head to look up. Renee’s face twisted into an excited grin, and she started to chant. The words were muffled, but Alex felt the spell start to work.The spark of her magic seemed to rush through her. The force was pulled up, all the way from the bottom of her feet up through her chest and towards her face. Alex pulled back against the force, not wanting to let her magic go. The magic seemed to stop, the rush swirling through her chest, but Renee’s words grew louder. Alex wanted to stop her, but she didn’t think she could.Renee’s hands grew warm on her face, and Alex felt the first drops of her magic leave her. The pull was slow, but Alex could feel her magic screaming at her. It didn’t want to leave, and it became painful as Renee’s hands grew hotter.There was a rush of wind, and suddenly the heat and the pain stopped. Renee was yanked away from standing in front of her and disappeared from sight. Alex’s body became loose, but she couldn’t keep herself up. Before she slumped to the ground, two hands grabbed her, keeping her on her knees.It took a moment for Alex to catch her breath and gain control of her body, but it wasn’t quick enough to take in the body before her. They disappeared; the hands keeping her up vanished, causing her to fall forward. Alex caught herself on the palm of her hands before she looked up.Elijah was standing in front of Alex, his back to her and his front to Renee. His fists were clenched, but he stood straight, his posture confident. Renee didn’t seem too upset about Elijah’s arrival; she just looked cocky.Alex pushed herself up, her legs shaking as she stood. Elijah should have still been under her spell, frozen in place. Renee attempt to take her magic must have broken it and let Elijah go. Alex took a step forward but stumbled. She managed to keep herself up but leant her hands onto her knees.“It’s valiant that you think you can save her,” mocked Renee.Elijah’s body tensed. “It’s naive to think you can kill me, witch.”Renee smirked. “I know I can’t kill you.” She turned her head to the side. “At least not permanently.” Renee twisted her wrist.What followed was Elijah’s leg snapping, forcing him to the ground and making him cry out.“Elijah,” yelled Alex.Renee chuckled. “One thing I didn’t understand, Alex.” She twisted her hand. Elijah’s bones continued to break. “You were disgusted by vampires and their existence, you were happily in love with James, and you traded him for an undead monster. Why?”Alex glared at her. “You wouldn’t understand. You lack a heart.”Renee sighed and shrugged. “Oh well.”She used her other hand to throw Alex across the ground. Alex’s tumbled through the grass and smacked into the base of a tree. She cried out as pain radiated through her back, her lungs gasping for breath as the wind was knocked from her. Alex tried to push herself up, she needed to help Elijah, but she couldn’t seem to find her feet.“Ahh!” Elijah yelled out in pain.Alex forced her head up to see Renee holding on to Elijah. Her nails were embedded into the side of his neck as she smiled down at him. Alex could only watch as Elijah’s skin turned pale white, and dark veins grew from his heart and slowed stretched out across him.Renee was desiccating him.“No! Elijah!” Alex found the strength to find her feet and rushed towards them, her feet stumbling and her body falling with every step.Renee didn’t break from her spell; it was stopping Elijah’s heart with every beat. Alex couldn’t understand how she was doing such a thing. Renee wasn’t stopping someone’s heart; she seemed to be using her raw power to fuel the spell.Elijah slumped to his knees. The black veins covered every inch of his skin.“No,” Alex cried.Renee dropped him and took a step back as Alex dropped beside them. Alex grasped at Elijah’s jacket, pulling him towards her. One of her hands cupped his face, his eyes shifting. He could hear and see everything, and the pain in his eyes made her heart ache.“Once we are finished here, I’ll track down Klaus and desiccate him too. I think returning to the Council with two Originals would be much better than returning with you.” Renee chuckled and knelt to touch Alex’s head. She stroked her hair. “Now, where were we.”Alex felt the pull return. Alex gasped, her hand tightening on Elijah’s jacket. She couldn’t let Renee win, not with everything at stake. She turned to grab Renee’s hand, catching her wrist and digging her nails in.Renee flinched as she drew blood but smirked. “Fighting every step of the way.” Her smirk became a smile. “Just how I taught you.”Alex anger flared, and she glared at Renee. She was starting to feel weak and tried to grasp at her magic; she tried to tangle her will around it and pull it back into her core. Alex dug her nails in further and let out a cry of protest when she felt a jolt. Flowing through Renee, Alex could feel her magic, but she felt something else. A familiar connection flowing and swirling within Renee. It wasn’t Renee’s magic; hers was heavy and suffocating. This magic felt warm, like fire.Alex closed her eyes and reached for the warmth, and she felt the spark in her chest grow.Renee gasped. “What did you just do?” She tried to pull away, but Alex held firm.Alex found the warmth and pulled at it. Without much coaxing, the warmth leapt towards her, and Renee let out a scream.“No! How?” Renee yanked at their connection; she tried to yank herself away.Alex was hit with a blast of heat as she felt her magic flood back into her. The familiar comfort of her power flooded her core, but it wasn’t alone. The heat that joined it intertwined her own power and nestled itself in. The power boost felt overwhelming. Alex looked up at Renee and smiled, she understood what Renee had meant, but this felt like she was connecting with a witch. It felt like she knew this witch well.Renee pulled herself from Alex’s grasp and stumbled backwards, falling onto her bum. Alex looked down at her hands and felt the magic moving beneath the surface. She felt like she could do anything.“How did you do that?” asked Renee.Alex smirked. “To syphon, you had to open yourself up to me to absorb my magic. You broke your way into me, so I reached back inside of you. Except I didn’t just find my own magic, I found something even more special.” Alex pushed herself to stand and grunted at the pain along her back. “Nadia’s magic. I didn’t even need to force it to leave you. It reached out and grabbed me with desperation, so I took it.”Renee looked at Alex with a mix of wonder and horror.“It seems Nadia’s magic feels at home in me.”Renee’s face sneered, and she stood. “You won’t win. You may have beat me today, but I will get you one day.” She turned to walk towards the trees.“Where are you going?” asked Alex.Renee paused. “You won. Take your brother, your lover and go. We can finish this later.”Alex thought about it for a moment. If Renee was so confident, she would have never let Alex just walk away. She would have beaten her to death, just like she had almost done. But by taking back her magic and taking Nadia’s, Renee was now running scared. But for how long? Alex could watch Renee leave, but she would spend the rest of her life waiting for the Council and for Renee to show back up.“No, we are finishing this now,” said Alex.Renee frowned.Accidentally killing a witch had almost broken Alex before, but there was something she now understood. Sometimes ending a life was necessary; to protect those that you loved and to help those who couldn’t help themselves. How many people would suffer if Renee lived? How many witches would she drain? How many vampires would she slaughter? It was going to end here.“What?” Renee smirked. “Are you going to kill me?” She laughed.Alex lifted her hand and nodded. “I am.”The twist of Alex’s wrist was followed by the loud crack of Renee’s neck. Renee’s body slumped to the ground, and Alex let out a shaky breath. She gave one last look to Renee before she turned to Elijah.His eyes were wide, and while Alex could see his pain, she could also see something else in his eyes. She knelt down beside him and cupped his face. “I’m sorry I froze you.” She stroked his cheek and lifted a hand up. She looked at her wrist and said, “Secare.” A small cut appeared on her wrist. She turned her hand over and let her blood drip onto Elijah’s lips and into his mouth.Elijah’s eyes widened, and his mouth opened enough to suck on the blood coming from her wrist.Alex smiled softly, stroking his hair and said, “Take what you need.”Elijah’s eyes softened as she felt his fangs expand and slide through her skin. She left out a gasp as she felt a small twinge but ignored the slight pain for the relief to see his colour starting to return.He stopped drinking after a few moments and sat up. His colour was still faint, but the veins were gone.“You need more,” said Alex.Elijah shook his head. “A blood bag will be fine. You are already hurt enough.” He lifted his hand to touch her face.She leaned into her touch and said, “I love you.”Elijah’s body paused before his face lit up in a smile. “You do?”She nodded. “It is why I was so angry at you. I fell in love with you and thought you had made a fool out of me.”Elijah shook his head, his hand cupping the back of her head. “No. You aren’t a fool. Because I fell in love with you as well.”Alex smiled and reached up to kiss him. He loved her, and that was all she needed to know they would find a way through this mess.“Hello!” A muffled voice made Alex pull back.“Shit! Jeremy.” She lept up and turned to her brother, who was sitting against a tree, bound a gagged, looking far from impressed. Alex smiled and said, “Sorry.”

    Alex didn’t want to let Elijah go. He was looking a lot better, but his skin was still pale. As they had walked back to the car, Alex had held his hand firmly, scared to let it go, but now she had too. Elijah felt that he needed to try and talk some sense in Klaus, not that Alex thought it would do any good, but Elijah couldn’t turn his back on his brother anymore. Alex understood what he needed to do but found it hard to release his hand.“I will meet you at your house once I’ve spoken to Klaus,” said Elijah.Alex frowned. “You think he will let you leave once you suggest he doesn’t break the curse.”Elijah sighed. “I don’t know what will happen, but I have to try.” He pressed a kiss to her forehead. “I love you.”Alex melted at the words and reached up for a quick kiss. “I love you too.”Elijah squeezed her hand before he stepped back. Alex held on for a moment longer before letting him go. He smiled at her before he was gone with a blur.Jeremy sighed from the other side of the car and said, “I’m still annoyed that you left me tied up while you made out with your brother, but I’m glad you’re happy.”Alex smiled at her brother. “Thank you. It’s not exactly easy, but I think we will work all of this out once Klaus has been dealt with.”They climbed into the car, Alex groaning as her back ached.“Do you think Elijah will be able to convince Klaus?” asked Jeremy.Alex wanted to believe that he could. “No, I don’t. I think Elijah is looking for the brother that was human.” She started the car. “And I can’t help but hope that Klaus still has some humanity left.” *** Pulling up outside the Gilbert house, Alex noticed that Damon’s car was parked at the bottom of the drive, as was the one James had hired. She pulled into the driveway and frowned at the open front door.Alex glanced at Jeremy and said, “Stay close.”Jeremy looked confused but nodded.They climbed out of the car and walked towards the front door. Alex paused when she saw Stefan leaning over someone. They were splayed out on the floor, and he was patting their face. Alex walked inside and frowned. Elena was standing to the side, Bonnie had her arms wrapped around her, and she looked terrified. Stefan was kneeling over an unconscious Alaric who wasn’t moving or breathing from the look of it. But Jenna was nowhere to be seen.“What happened?” she asked.Stefan looked up at her. “Alaric was like this when we got back.”Alex turned to Elena. She walked over to her sister and pulled her into a hug. “Are you okay?”“He took Jenna,” sobbed Elena.“He who?”“Klaus,” explained Bonnie.“How? I told you all to stay inside.” Alex stepped away from Elena, who wiped her face and spotted Jeremy.“Jeremy.” Elena rushed over to hug him.“I’m okay,” he said.“Elena, what happened?” pushed Alex.“Jenna got a phone call from Alaric; she told him to come here so he would be safe. But when he showed up, Klaus appeared before he could get inside. Jenna freaked and stepped outside when Klaus grabbed him. I tried to pull her back, but she ran towards Klaus as he snapped Alaric’s neck. Klaus grabbed Jenna and disappeared.” Elena swallowed and crossed her arms over her stomach.“He didn’t ask for you to surrender yourself or the moonstone?”Elena shook her head.“Damon and I showed up just after it happened. We got Alaric inside before anyone could see him, at least, I think we did.” Stefan stood up.“Where is Damon? And James and Robert? The cars out front?” Alex asked.“Damon went to see if he could find Klaus. James came back alone; he dropped Robert and Sarah off at their hotel,” said Bonnie. “James is upstairs.”Alex nodded. “Okay. I’ll try and track Jenna. You all just stay inside. If I hear a door open, I really will seal you all in here.”She got an agreed nod from everyone before she headed upstairs.Alex didn’t know what to think. Klaus having Jenna wasn’t good; he could do anything to her. But they could trust Elijah; he wouldn’t let Klaus hurt her. Still, she was concerned that Klaus hadn’t asked Elena for anything. He could be biding his time, wanting them all to panic and become desperate enough that they would do anything.Upstairs, James was in Alex’s room. He was sitting on the floor with his legs crossed, a map open, and Jenna’s favourite shirt in his hand. He looked up as Alex walked in.“What happened with Renee?” he asked.Alex took a deep breath. “She’s dead.”James’ eyes widened. “Wow.”Alex nodded and sat down across from him. “Yep. She wanted me to give her the moonstone and for me to surrender myself to her. I refused to do both, and she decided to kill me then and there.” She ran her fingers through her hair. “She tried to syphon my magic.”James’ face darkened. “Tried?”“Yeah. Elijah showed up and interrupted it.” Alex clasped her hands together. “If he hadn’t shown up, I’d be dead by now.”“But your not. You were strong enough.”“It was actually my grandmother who helped me.”“Your grandmother?”Alex nodded and smiled. She could still feel the warmth of Nadia’s magic flowing through her. “Nadia Ravenwood was Renee’s mentor and my grandmother. She defected from the Council, and Renee was sent to bring her back. Instead, Renee syphoned Nadia’s magic, and that process killed her.”“So Renee had Nadia’s magic in addition to hers?”“Yeah. But when Renee was syphoning my magic, I could feel Nadia’s. It was so similar to mine, yet so different. So comforting and warm, and I just reached for it. Next thing, I turned Renee’s spell against her. I syphoned back my magic and took Nadia’s with it.”James looked at her, stunned.“I didn’t even mean to.” Alex let out a sigh.“Did you take Renee’s magic?”Alex shook her head. “No. Renee broke the connection and was freaked out. She tried to just walk away.”James frowned.“Everyone kept telling me when I killed that witch that sometimes death is necessary to keep those you love safe. If I let Renee just leave, I would spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder, wondering when she would show back up. It was safer for everyone if she wasn’t around,” she explained.Looking at James, she couldn’t read his expression.She said, “You think I made the wrong call?”James shrugged. “I don’t know. Renee was someone I had known for a long time; it is hard to hear that she is dead even after discovering what she was really doing. I understand why you made the decision you did, but it’s still a shock.”Alex glanced at the map. He hadn’t had any luck tracking Jenna.“What happened to her body?” asked James.“I buried her where she died. Her body is deep enough that no one will accidentally dig her up.” Alex sighed. “And now Klaus has Jenna.”“We will find her,” said James.“I have no doubt. Klaus will want us to show up to his sacrifice with the moonstone and Elena ready.” She rubbed her face.“What do you want to do?” asked James.Before she could answer, her phone started to ring. Alex pulled it out and wanted to sigh with relief at seeing Elijah’s name.She answered, “Hey, how’d it go?”The chuckle that came through the line chilled her.“I’d say my plan is going well,” said Klaus.“Why do you have Elijah’s phone?”“Well, where he is, he won’t be needing it, so I borrowed it so that I could talk to my favourite Ravenwood witch.”“If you hurt him!”“Elijah is fine. No one will hurt him while he is under my care. But he won’t be coming to your rescue like he did with that witch.”“What did you do to him?”“I reunited him with our siblings, just like he has wanted for oh so long.”“You staked him?”“I did. Unfortunately, I had to do it in his back since he was trying to insist that he had to return to you after he spouted his ludicrous ideas about me not breaking my curse. Can you imagine? Me, allowing a mortal to live after waiting a thousand years.” Klaus laughed.“I won’t let you hurt Elena.”“You say that a lot, but here’s the thing; Elijah is safe and sound and not coming to help. I have your human Aunt, who only has one life that I’d be more than happy to end, and the countdown is reaching its final few minutes. Now, you can bring me my doppelganger and the moonstone or I will kill your beloved Aunt Jenna. And while I know that she would say that she is willing to give up her life, I know you and Elena and little brother Jeremy won’t want to do that. But if, for some reason, you decide to not show up, I want you to know that her death will be excruciatingly painful. It will be long and slow, and by the time she is begging for death, it will be you that she blames, not me.”Alex’s hands were shaky.“The moon will reach its apex at midnight. You have until then to bring me the doppelganger and the moonstone, or it’s your Aunt’s funeral.”The call ended, and Alex dropped her phone onto the ground before her.“Klaus?” asked James.Alex nodded. “We have until midnight, or he kills Jenna.”“What do you want to do?” he asked.Alex knew that they were going to have to go to the sacrifice. There was no way that Klaus would just have Jenna anywhere; she would be hard to find. He would need to tell them. That meant taking the moonstone and Elena to face off with Klaus.“I need you to do something.”James nodded. “Anything.”“We are going to have to face off with Klaus. Elena will have to be put right in the middle of it so that we can find our moment, but I won’t risk her life.”“Alright, what did you want to do?”“Link my life to Elena’s.”James frowned. “No.”“James, please.”“If I link you and she dies, then you’ll die.”“I know, but she won’t stay dead. I would give my life for Elena, for all of my family. If Elena has to die to stop Klaus, I want to make sure that she will come back. I want her to have a future after Klaus.”“And how will she feel knowing you died because of her.”“She will have to accept my choice.”“You’ll need her blood.”“I’ll tell her it’s for something else.”“Alex…”Alex reached for James’ hand. “Please, James.”He sighed and nodded. “Fine.”“Thank you.” She squeezed his hand. “For everything.”“I would do anything for you.” He lifted their hands and pressed a kiss to the back of her hand. “I’ll go get Elena’s blood.”She smiled at him warmly as he stood and left the room.Alex didn’t want to have to face the possibility that one of them would die would happen. They were going to face off against Klaus without Elijah, and Elena might just have to go through the whole process of dying. Jenna hadn’t done anything besides loving them, and she was dragged into it all. Alex’s responsibility was to make sure that Elena and Jenna both made it home safe.Getting up from the floor, Alex grabbed a notebook from her draw and a pen. She needed to explain herself to Elena, so that Elena understood the decisions she had made. Alex didn’t want Elena to hold onto any blame or guilt; she wanted Elena to grow up and be happy and experience the world. 
  Dear Elena,

  If you are reading this, then what I never wanted to happen has come to pass. Klaus’ curse was broken, and you had to suffer through a death that you should never have had to experience. And I am dead. I hope that everyone is safe and at home with you.

  I have asked James to bind us together to keep you safe. You won’t know it, as I have asked James to not tell you the truth, but I couldn’t risk your life without the reassurance that your life would not end by Klaus’ hands.

  I am giving up my life so that you may live the one you deserve. The life where there is no curse looming over your head. I want you to finish school and travel the world, experience what life has to offer and never look back.

  I will be with you every step of the way in your journey, and I will always love you.

  Alex.

   
Tearing the letter from the book, Alex folded it in half and wrote Elena’s name on it. She would make sure to leave it for Elena before they left.The door opened, and James walked in holding a glass with blood. He nodded his head and gave Alex a grim smile.“Thank you,” she said.
  
    Chapter Text
    Alex reached across the console of the car to grab Elena’s hand. She gave it a firm squeeze and looked at her sister, who looked alarmingly calm. Elena placed her other hand on top of Alex’s and offered a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.“Are you sure about this?” Alex asked.Elena nodded. “I am. I trust you.”Alex said, “By the time the sun rises, you will be safe, and Klaus will be sealed in a coffin.”Elena squeezed their joined hands again before she opened the car door and climbed out. Alex climbed out too and walked around, her hand falling to grasp at her pocket where the moonstone sat.Things weren’t going according to plan, not at all. Alex had realised that beating Klaus wasn’t going to be so simple and straightforward. He could have more than just his witch with him; he was holding Jenna hostage and at any moment could decide to kill her. She also could risk Klaus killing her because the link that now bound her to Elena – to keep Elena safe – would have the reserve effect if Klaus decided she was in the way. All of these things meant that Alex needed Klaus at his weakest moment, but to get him there, he would need to break his curse.No one had reacted well when Alex had explained it to them. Elena had agreed, not knowing that after Klaus killed her and broke the curse that Alex would die in her place. James had stood beside her, but she could also see his dislike for the plan. Stefan and Damon, however, refused to accept it. Elena’s friends had protested as well, but seeing Elena’s insistence and Alex confidence that it would work, they had come around. But Damon had refused.Damon had blocked their way when they had tried to leave; he had grabbed Elena and tried to force vampire blood down her throat. It had been his desperate attempt to save Elena, thinking only about himself, but Alex had prevented him from doing it. Damon had laid across the front porch with a broken neck, leaving only Stefan to try and convince Elena not to go. But he hadn’t succeeded.Alex hadn’t trusted the Salvatore brothers to stay out of it. She knew that he would interfere once Damon had woken up, so she decided to seal them inside the house. The boundary spell would break when the full moon hit its peak, but they wouldn’t have enough time to reach them and get in the way by then.So there they were, minutes away from facing Klaus, and there was no turning back. James walked in front with Robert, both of them and Sarah were there as backup, just in case, Klaus had more minions hiding.Elena stopped walking, making Alex look back at her.“What’s wrong?” asked Alex.Elena frowned. “I’m scared.”Alex glanced at James and Robert, who stepped away to give them some privacy. Sarah lingered closer but not too close.“It’s okay to be scared.”“I don’t want to be, though. I feel that if I’m scared, it means that Klaus wins.”Alex sighed. “Monsters like Klaus thrive off fear, and he will enjoy your fear, but that doesn’t mean he has won. He has no idea what is going to happen, and when he realises that he walked right into our trap, he will be the one who is scared.”Elena said, “When this is all over, can you promise me something?”Alex held in the pained expression that wanted to fall over her face, and she nodded.“Can we all go to the Lake House? You, me, Jeremy and Jenna.”Alex smiled. Their family’s Lake House had always held good memories for them. “That sounds like a great plan. Maybe during the Summer, we can spend a month down there.”Elena nodded. “That would be great.”“Alex, we need to go,” called James.She glanced at him and nodded. She looked back at Elena and said, “No matter what happens, I love you.”Elena smiled. “I love you too.” *** The clearing was set, like it was Klaus’ stage. He stood in the centre, his arms behind his back and a satisfied smirk on his face. A few meters from him stood Greta; before her on a rock sat an altar that she was chanting over. And just to their left were two others, circles of fire binding them in place as they lay on the ground unmoving.Alex stepped up in front of Elena, her eyes locked on Klaus. James, Robert and Sarah kept their distance. It was possible Klaus knew they were lingering just out of view, but Alex hoped he would be too focused on Elena and herself. There was no sign of Jenna, meaning he probably hadn’t brought her to the clearing. She had already told James that if Jenna was nowhere to be seen, to have Bonnie try and locate her while they were there.Klaus took a step forward and said, “Thank you for being so punctual.”“Where is Jenna?” asked Alex.Klaus smirked. “She’s safe. I will return her to you once my curse is broken.”“You’re not getting the moonstone until I have Jenna.”He laughed. “You think I trust you. I hand over your Aunt, and then I have nothing to hold over you. So, tonight shall go as I say. You will give me the moonstone, Elena will join her fellow sacrificial lambs, and Greta will break my curse. Once I am my full self, your Aunt will be returned unharmed.”“What makes you think that I trust you not to just kill us all and Jenna once you’re done?” asked Alex.Klaus sighed and shrugged. “I don’t really care if you trust me. But if you don’t do as I say, Jenna will have every inch of her skin peeled off and fed back to her.” His face darkened, and he held out his hand. “Now, moonstone.”Alex slid her hand into her pocket and pulled out the stone. It felt wrong to hand it over to him, but there was no other choice.Klaus bowed his head and smirked. “Wise choice.”Alex’s skin crawled as Klaus’ fingers touched her hand. He grasped the stone and pulled away, but not before Alex’s whole body screamed at her to get away from him. But she held her ground and didn’t let her disgust for him show.“Maybe Elijah was right about you.” His words were soft and mocking.Alex sneered at him but didn’t respond. Once Klaus was dealt with, she would ensure that someone found him. He didn’t deserve to be locked in a coffin because his brother was a selfish bastard. It hurt to know that she would never see Elijah again, but she was glad that the last moments she’d had with Elijah, she had told him exactly how she felt.“Elena, my dear,” said Klaus. “Right this way.” He directed Elena towards the two burning circles.Elena glanced at Alex before taking a deep breath and walking forward. Alex itched to reach out to stop Elena; she was letting her sister walk to her death, no matter how temporary it would be.“It’s very brave of you,” said Klaus. He reached out to tuck a piece of hair behind Elena’s ear.Elena smacked at his hand. “I’m doing this to protect my family.”“I know exactly why you’re doing this.” Klaus smirked before turning away from Elena.Fire ignited around Elena, locking her in place as Klaus moved to the altar and Greta and handed over the moonstone. Greta smiled at Klaus, taking the moonstone and placing it into the bowl before her.“It is time,” said Greta.Klaus nodded.Alex took a step forward; she didn’t want Elena to feel alone.“You stay where you are, witch,” said Klaus. “Or I’ll kill you.”Alex sneered at him.Greta lifted her hands and began to chant. The bowl filled with a burning fire before she turned and nodded at Klaus. Alex could feel the magic in the moonstone; it trembled as it stirred as Greta channelled the moon’s power into it. Klaus walked towards the burning circles towards a woman who was beginning to wake up. The fire around her went out, allowing Klaus to step right up to her. The woman groaned and tried to push herself up. Klaus knocked her back down, his hand pressing at her chest.“Let me go,” the woman moaned.Klaus smiled at her. “I don’t think so.”Lifting his hand, Klaus plunged his hand into the woman’s chest, making her cry out for a moment before he tore her heart from her chest. Klaus walked back to Greta and held the heart over the bowl. Crushing it in his hands, Greta continued her spell.The magic around them flared as the first layer of the curse broke down.The woman in the next circle suddenly sat up. Elena jumped as she noticed the woman move, her eyes widening in recognition. Alex looked over at the woman, who tried to rush through the fire but stumbled back. The woman was Rose, the vampire who had originally kidnapped Elena to hand over to Elijah.“Rose,” said Elena.Rose looked around panic. “No, what is happening?”Elena said, “Klaus is breaking his curse.”Rose shook her head. “No. No. Elijah said I was free.”Klaus chuckled as he stepped towards them. “Elijah says a lot of things, but it wasn’t Elijah you and your beloved Trevor turned against. You allowed Katherina to escape; you allowed her to become a vampire. The only person who could give you your freedom would be me, and I say this is how you make up your betrayal to me. By sacrificing yourself to set me free.”The fire around Rose disappeared, and she glanced at Klaus and then at Greta, who was still chanting. She shook her head and disappeared in a flash towards Greta. Klaus reacted, chasing her, but Rose managed to reach Greta first. Greta’s neck snapped easily, making her drop the floor dead as Klaus grabbed Rose by her throat.The spell hadn’t broken, merely paused.Alex was surprised that Klaus hadn’t been quick enough to stop Rose; she was also surprised he hadn’t anticipated her choice to try and stop the curse from being broken.“You are going to regret that,” hissed Klaus.Rose choaked as Klaus started to crush her windpipe. She managed to gasp out, “It was worth it.”Klaus snapped Rose’s neck, killing her for the moment. He dropped her body onto the ground before glancing at Greta. He let out a huff before he turned to face Alex.Alex said, “Well, that was unexpected.”“It seems I require your assistance,” said Klaus.Alex eyebrow’s jumped up in surprise. She scoffed. “You seriously can’t think I would help you break your curse.”Klaus glared. “I do, and you will, and not just because I can still murder your Aunt, but if you don’t, I’ll kill Elena.”“You still need her.”Klaus sighed. “You see, I’ve waited a thousand years for this, but I think I’m willing to wait a little longer if I have to. Another doppelganger will pop up eventually, since magic demands that a doppelganger must exist…loophole and all…but that won’t matter because you will all be dead. Jenna, Elena, you, Jeremy. I will kill each and every one of you.”Alex’s body shivered at the thought of watching her family being torn apart.“I think the satisfaction of killing you all will keep me satisfied for the next five hundred years,” Klaus smirked. “Now, shall we continue?”
  
    Chapter Text
    Alex stepped up to the altar. Elena was still standing in a circle of fire, a mix of feelings across her face as she watched as Alex had to step over Greta’s dead body to look into the bowl. The moonstone was still holding its shape, flames burning around it, with the blood from the werewolf’s heart coating it.Klaus knelt down beside Rose’s unconscious body and pulled out a stake. He plunged it into her chest, making her body instantly start to turn grey. He pulled the stake from her chest before walking up to the altar. He smiled and held it out to Alex.“Drop it into the flames,” she said.Klaus did as she said; the stake – coated in Rose’s blood – turned to ash as it touched the flames, the blood mixing with that of the werewolf’s to make the moonstone crack. Alex could feel the magic of the moon as well as the moonstone; she lifted her hands to funnel the magic, directing it where it needed to go. It took a moment for the magic to settle, and Alex dropped her hands.The pleased look on Klaus’ face aggravated Alex, but she stayed where she was. The fire around Elena went out as Klaus turned and walked over to her. He stretched out his hand towards her like he was asking for nothing more than for her to walk with him. Elena knocked his hand away and strode past Klaus towards the altar. Klaus chuckled at her defiance but followed. Elena stopped on the other side of the altar and locked eyes with Alex. The fear was still present, but Alex could always see her determination and strength.Alex wanted nothing more than for there to be another way, but she needed Klaus to be weak. His first transition as a werewolf would be something he wouldn’t be able to stop, he would be vulnerable, and Alex could use it against him.Klaus stepped up behind Elena, his smirk firmly in place. He said, “Thank you, my dear.”Elena sneered at him and said, “Go to hell.”Klaus laughed softly before he pulled back and opened his mouth. Alex couldn’t tear her eyes away as Klaus’ fangs extended and the dark veins appeared beneath his eyes. He bit down on Elena’s throat, her face and body tensing as Klaus wrapped an arm around her.Alex felt her throat swell as Klaus drained away Elena’s life. Elena’s eyes closed, and her body drooped into Klaus’ arms.As Klaus pulled back, he opened his eyes, and they had turned a bright yellow. The fire in the bowl went out, and the moonstone was left as nothing more than dust in the bowl. Klaus dropped Elena, her body hitting the floor as Klaus took a step away from them.Alex dropped down beside Elena. For the moment, Elena was dead, and that thought brought tears to Alex’s eyes. She took a deep breath, telling herself that she would wake up, but there was one more thing she needed to do. Alex took a moment to hold Elena in her arms, but she looked up when she heard the first crack.Klaus cried out as his leg snapped, his transition having begun.Alex shifted to gently place Elena down on the ground. She brushed the hair from her face and went to stand. Before she could get up, hands grabbed at her and threw her to the ground. The furious face of Damon Salvatore glared down at her as his hands wrapped around her throat.“You sent your own sister to the slaughter,” he hissed.Alex glared up at him and struggled for breath as he pressed down.“Damon, what are you doing?” Stefan’s voice reached their ears.Damon kept his eyes fixed on her, the sound of Klaus’ bones broke behind them, and Alex knew they were wasting time.“Let me go,” snapped Alex.Damon sneered. “You killed your own sister!”Alex grabbed at his hands, her fingers wrapping around his wrists. She focused on his head, causing as much pain as she could. Damon’s cried out, and the pressure on her neck stopped. She used her hand to throw Damon away from her before standing up.Stefan was kneeling beside Elena. His hands holding her cheeks, tears stained his face.Alex said, “She will wake up.”Stefan frowned as he turned to her. “She’s dead.”Alex nodded. “But she won’t stay that way. Take her home; she will wake by the time the sun rises.”Stefan nodded and shifted to pick her up.“Stefan.”He turned back to Alex.“There’s a letter I left for Elena in my room. It’s on my nightstand. Give it to her for me?” she asked.Again, Stefan nodded before he took off.Alex took a breath to clear her mind as she turned to Klaus. He was on his hands and knees, his back-breaking and twisting. She walked towards him and spotted James, Robert and Sarah coming out from the trees. They circled around Klaus, and they started to chant. Alex watched as Klaus’ head snapped up, and he glared at the witches around him.“What are you doing?” he groaned out.Alex said, “You really think I would just let you break the curse with no consequences?”Klaus cried out as James, Robert and Sarah weakened him, their magic pressing against him and taking away his strength.“You see, normally, this kind of thing wouldn’t really work that well against you. Even being cursed, the magic that made you what you are makes you incredibly strong. But here’s the kicker, to make you practically unstoppable, you need to be at your weakest point. And what’s a werewolf’s most vulnerable moment? Their transition, especially the first one.” Alex stepped up to Klaus and smirked at him. “You did exactly what I wanted you to do, and now, I’m going to make sure you don’t hurt another soul ever again.”Klaus’ eyes widened, and the fear that flashed through them gave Alex more satisfaction than she could ever imagine.Alex grabbed either side of Klaus’ face and dug her nails into his skin. She started the spell, the words for a desiccation rolling off her tongue with familiar ease. Unlike the first time, she could feel the strength of her magic along with Nadia’s; her power swirled together inside of her, draining the life out of Klaus’ body and turning him into a husk.Klaus’ skin quickly started to turn deathly pale; the dark veins that Alex had watched take over Elijah’s body grew down his neck and along his arms. Klaus’s body shifted back to its normal form, the body unable to continue the transition into a werewolf.Alex smirked as Klaus’ heart slowed until she felt the final beat.The magic that swirled through her stopped, and Alex released Klaus. His body dropped to the ground, his eyes open wide. Alex let out a laugh of relief before she stumbled back into James’ arms. He lowered her to the ground as she smiled and let the exhaustion take over her.“I did,” she gasped.James nodded. “You did.”Alex squeezed his hand and closed her eyes for a moment. When she opened them again, Robert had rolled Klaus onto his back.James said, “What do you want to do with him?”“I think sealing him in a coffin sounds like a plan,” said Alex.Robert nodded and nudged Sarah. “Let’s go.”Sarah gave them both a smile before walking away with Robert.Alex leant happily against James and smiled. “I could have gotten used to the extra power boost.”James chuckled. “It was very hot watching you take him down.”Alex laughed. “Why, thank you, I do try.” She patted James’ knee. “Can you do something for me?”James frowned. “Alex…”“No, please, just listen.” She grasped his hand. “If you can’t find a way to kill him, make sure no one can ever find him. Bury him in the bottom of the ocean if you have to, but no one can wake him up.”James intertwined their fingers and said, “I can’t promise that.”“Why not?”“I lied to you.”Alex frowned.“I didn’t bind Elena’s life to yours.”Horror washed over Alex as James’ words sunk in. She spun around, finding the strength to push herself to her knees. Alex grabbed James shirt. “You what?” she shouted.James hushed her and held her face. “I bound her to mine.”The horror didn’t fade as she understood what James had done. This man had loved her through the roughest point in her life. He had helped her become who she was, stood beside her, fort with her, and understood when she had realised that her love for him wasn’t what he held for her. Alex had cherished every moment spent with him, and now he had done something that she should have expected but didn’t.“No,” she whimpered. Tears flooded her eyes.“I had too,” he said.Alex shook her head. “Why would you do something so stupid?”James smiled and cupped her cheeks. “Because I love you, Alexandra Ravenwood, and you deserve to live your life with your family.”“What about your life? What about Sarah?” she cried.James smiled sadly. “Sarah has already yelled and screamed at me, but she understands.” He stroked her cheek. “Elena would never forever herself if she woke up and you never came home. And besides, you have so much more to offer the world. I know you will make it a better place for everyone; humans, witches, vampires and werewolves alike.”Alex swallowed and buried her face into James’ shoulder. She wrapped her arms around him and let herself grieve. He was the better of them, and his selflessness would be something she never forgot.
  
    Chapter Text
    Robert and Sarah returned to the Quarry with a coffin and a heavy chain. Sarah stopped beside Alex and James, who were still holding onto one another. Sarah knelt down beside them, wrapped her arms around them, and squeezed them. Alex felt fresh tears fill her eyes, and she wanted to beg for Sarah’s forgiveness. She was losing her brother because Alex had been so desperate to save Elena and stop Klaus. But Alex couldn’t find the words to speak.Robert carried the chain over to Klaus and held out his hand. He mumbled a few words before the chain started to wrap itself around Klaus, binding him so that if he did get a drop of blood, he wouldn’t be free instantly. He then opened the coffin and, with a wave of his hand, lifted Klaus and laid him down in the box.Klaus’ furious eyes glared at them as he looked up. Alex felt the joy of victory over the monster that had tortured them all, but she couldn’t enjoy it properly. Knowing that James would be dead before the sun would rise took away that mood to celebrate.Robert closed the lid of Klaus’ coffin and said, “What do you want to do with him?”Alex wiped her face and pushed herself to stand. She left James’ embrace and held out her hand. She waved her hand over her other hand, and a small line cut through her skin. Alex smeared her blood across the coffin and said, “Sigillum.”No one would be able to open the coffin unless they had her blood or the blood of someone who shared her bloodline.“I will keep him hidden until I can either kill him,” said Alex.Sarah pulled her phone from her pocket and said, “I think I know the perfect spot.”Alex looked at her, intrigued.“Elijah’s witch friend, Jonas. He was looking for that sight of those dead witches,” said Sarah.Alex nodded.“I think I found it. It’s an old abandoned house, supposedly haunted.” Sarah smirked. “Probably by the witches who were burned on that spot. I’m sure they’d be more than happy to help keep Klaus’ body hidden.”“That’s perfect,” said Alex.James patted Sarah on the head. “Well done, young one.”Sarah snorted and smacked his hand away. They all laughed as Sarah nudged him. “Stop it.”James smirked for a moment, but it faltered. He stumbled forward, Sarah and Alex catching him only just. They knelt down and sat down side by side. Robert placed his hands on James’ shoulder as Alex and Sarah held a hand each.James said, “I think it might be my time.” His voice shook.Alex leant her head on his shoulder. “There’s no rush.”James smiled. “I love you all.”Sarah hiccuped as she started to cry and buried her head into James’ side. Alex reached for her with her free hand and glanced up at the sky. The black had given way to the lightest of blues as the sun started to peek over the horizon. More colours were starting to show, and Alex would almost think the moment was perfect, except that James’ body stilled as he took his last breath. *** It took the group a moment to move. They laid James down on the ground, and each took a moment to say their final goodbye. Alex stepped away as Sarah pressed a kiss to her brother’s forehead and looked out over the Quarry.Robert stepped up beside her and laid his arm over her shoulders. “It’s a new day,” he said.Alex nodded. “A day I didn’t think I’d see.”Robert sighed. “Well, you better not waste it. Or any day from now on.”Alex smiled. “James used to love wasting his time. He was impossible to get out of bed.”Robert chuckled. “True that.” He rubbed her arm. “I’m not going back to the Council.”“I’m glad.”“I was thinking about heading to New York; I’ve always wanted to experience life in the Big Apple.”“As long as you call.”“Of course. Need to make sure you don’t get into too much trouble.”Alex smiled. “The only trouble I get in is when I’m trying to help others out of it.”“Well, maybe your vampire boyfriend will help you out of it.”“Yeah, if I can find him.”“I believe in you. You have that extra power now, and with Klaus’ witch dead, her spells would have dropped.”“He didn’t necessarily have Greta cloak Elijah or his siblings.”“Either way, you’ll find them.” Robert squeezed her shoulders.Alex’s eye widened. “Shit. I forgot about Jenna.”“Jenna’s fine,” called Sarah.Alex and Robert turned. Sarah was still kneeling beside James.She said, “Bonnie messaged me, and I forgot to tell you. Once Greta died, Bonnie located her. Alaric and her went to go get her. She’s back at the house.”Alex sighed with relief. “Thank God!”They looked at James’ body, and Alex walked over to Sarah. Taking her hand, Alex asked, “What do you want to do?”Sarah said, “I want to stay with you if that’s okay.”Alex nodded. “Of course.”Sarah smiled. “You’re the only family I have left now.”Alex squeezed her hand. “Not just me.”“Did you want to burn James’ body?” asked Robert.Sarah nodded.It took almost an hour to set up a pyre for James. Around his body, Robert, Sarah and Alex collected wood to surround him. Ideally, they would move James and place him somewhere Sarah could easily visit to remember her brother, but they didn’t have the time or a place in mind to do such a thing. But as they stepped back and Sarah ignited the wood, the sun had risen over the trees warming the Quarry. The sky was clear, and the bright blue skies seemed to be leading towards a beautiful day.Alex stayed with Sarah and Robert for another half hour as the fire burned, but she needed to move Klaus. Promising to meet them back at their hotel room later that day, Alex needed to move Klaus to where he would be safe and go back to the house to check on everyone.Klaus’ coffin was easily transported, using a clever levitation spell, to get the coffin through the trees and into the back of the car. Sarah had given Alex the location of the witches house and headed straight there. It wasn’t too far from the Quarry, about a ten-minute drive down the road, but Alex would need to walk through the woods to find it.And find it she did. The house stood tall, but the age was apparent. Alex approached the house’s front doors, the coffin following behind her. As she stepped up onto the porch, she felt them; the witches. Their power flowed through every inch of the house, and it vibrated Alex’s skin.She moved towards the entry hall and said, “Sister, I require your assistance. I have bound the hybrid in this coffin and was hoping you would be willing to keep him hidden for the time being. I would feel secure with him under your gaze and power.”The house creaked as the wind blew before she felt the burn of power touch her and a hiss of words in the air. The coffin behind her moved without her direction and headed towards the basement. Alex smiled and followed it down into a dusty room where it sat itself on the floor and then disappeared.“Thank you, sisters,” said Alex. “I will return when I have found a better location.”The magic burned around her for a moment and then returned to the normal buzz. Alex turned to leave, happy that Klaus wouldn’t be found. *** The Gilbert house was surrounded by cars when Alex pulled up. She took a deep breath before she climbed out of her car and headed to the door. She had no idea what kind of reception she was going to get, especially since by now, Elena would probably have read her letter and thought she was dead. But the main thing is that they were both here, and Alex would make sure that Elena got to her enjoy her human life.Alex pushed open the front door and was a little surprised at the full house of people before her. Really, it shouldn’t have surprised her that Elena’s friends were all gathered in the house. They had all been affected in some way by Klaus, and they had all come through alive.The first face that Alex took in was Jenna’s. She was leaning against the kitchen counter, a cup of what she assumed was coffee in her hands and dark circles under her eyes. Jenna’s dark face went white with shock, and the cup in her hands was knocked to the ground with a loud crash. The rest of the room jumped before they all turned to see that she was staring at Alex.“Alex?” Jenna’s voice was confused.Suddenly, Elena appeared in front of Alex. Her tear-stained face was red and relieved. “You’re alive!” yelled Elena.Alex nodded. “You can thank James.”Elena let out a sob and rushed towards Alex. She threw her arms around her neck and sobbed as she squeezed Alex. “I thought you were dead because of me.”Alex squeezed Elena back, the last time having seen her lifeless body, to feel the life flowing through her was a relief. “I know, I should have been, but James bound his life to yours instead of mine.”Elena pulled back and frowned. “Does that mean…”Alex nodded. “James died a few hours ago. It would have been when you woke up.”Elena swallowed. “I’m sorry.”Shaking her head, Alex cupped Elena’s face. “James did what he believed was right; it wasn’t your fault.”A pair of arms wrapped around Alex’s side, and she glanced to see Jeremy. She smiled at her brother as he pressed his face into her hair. “I’m glad you’re alive.”Alex wrapped an arm around his head. “Me too.”Jenna walked around them and joined in the hugging. She pressed a kiss to Alex’s head and let out a heavy sigh of relief. “No more curses, okay. Let’s just have some normal drama, like not doing homework or sneaking out and getting drunk.”They laughed, and Jeremy said, “I think I second that.”“Me too,” mumbled Elena.Alex smiled with relief and closed her eyes. Her family was safe; those that she loved would never have to deal with Klaus again, not while she was still breathing.

    A hot shower and sleep had been the cure that Alex needed. After getting back home to her family, the exhaustion of desiccating Klaus, losing James and being awake all night had left her barely standing. She had showered to wash away the grime that seemed to cling to her skin before getting into her bed and sleeping until noon. She was woken up by Elena, who had food for them both, and instead of getting up, Elena joined Alex under her covers, and they ate side by side.Alex couldn’t remember the last time a sandwich had tasted so good.When they had finished their meal, Alex laid back down and looked at Elena. The bags beneath Elena’s eyes and the sag of her shoulders showed her own exhaustion, but there seemed to be more lingering behind her eyes.Alex asked, “What’s bouncing around inside that head?”Elena sighed. She said, “What happened after I….” Elena’s brow tensed. “Died?”Alex licked her lips and pushed herself back up slightly. “Stefan and Damon showed up. I told Stefan to bring you back here; Damon – I think – must have followed because he disappeared. I then dealt with Klaus. He was going through a transition, his werewolf side taking over, so he was weak. James, Robert and Sarah channelled their power to weaken him even more and then I desiccated him.”Elena nodded slowly. “And what about James?”Alex had told them that James had given his life for Elena, taking Alex’s place, but she hadn’t really wanted to discuss it any further than that. But the guilt that seemed to flash in Elena’s eyes made Alex understand that it wasn’t just her who felt guilty.Alex said, “He died peacefully like he was falling asleep. Sarah, Robert and I all sat with him. And when Sarah was ready, we burned his body.”“You cremated him?”Alex nodded. “Explaining his death would be impossible; getting him buried in the cemetery would just bring up all sorts of questions, so it was safer and quicker. Sarah collected some of the ashes to keep.”Elena asked, “What is Sarah going to do now?”“She said she wants to stay with me. There aren’t enough rooms here, but I think we can sort something out,” Alex explained.“I want to say something to her, but I don’t know what to say,” said Elena.Alex understood that. Sarah and James had been so alone in their lives for so long, all they had was each other. James had raised Sarah after their parent’s deaths, and when Alex stepped into their lives, Sarah had been nothing but welcoming. Alex thought that she deserved more backlash from Sarah, some kicking and screaming, but Sarah didn’t hold anyone responsible. In her eyes, James had done what he thought was best like he always did. She couldn’t hold his choice against them.“Sarah would just be happy to have a friend,” said Alex. “She doesn’t blame you or me for James’ choice.”Elena scrunched up her nose. “I feel like she should.”Alex nodded. “Yeah, so do I.” She grabbed Elena’s hand. “But we can’t always control how others deal with things.”“I just wish I could have thanked him.”Alex smiled. The other side was a mystery to them all. But Alex knew that James was over there, most likely watching them, and he knew. She said, “I’m sure he knows.”Elena’s small smile was enough to ease Alex’s mind as they both lay down. Alex hugged her sister as they did and felt the warmth of a familiar presence around her. James was there, and he did know. *** Things seemed to go back to normal the following week. Elena and Jeremy were back at school; Jenna was also focusing on her classes, leaving Alex to work out her own next steps. The first thing Alex wanted to really do was find Elijah and his siblings, but so far, she hadn’t been able to track them. Magic seemed to be useless in finding them but what Alex had managed to find was Klaus’ home, or at least where he’d been squatting while he’d been tormenting them.The house was just outside of town. It was in perfect condition with new furniture all laid out and the appearance that it had recently been occupied. She found a room that she was confident had been Greta’s; the clothes and the witch items were enough to give it away, but the photo beside her bed of her standing with her brother and father had only solidified it.The picture was a surprise for Alex; Greta had helped Klaus kill her family, and she hadn’t seemed to care. Maybe she did care about them, but her delusional obsession with Klaus was more important than them.Alex also found an art studio. Full of paint, brushes of all sizes, bits of charcoal and paintings, Alex found images of Klaus and others, some whom she assumed were his siblings. There was even a few of Elijah. She could never have imagined that Klaus, of all people, would appreciate something like art.The house didn’t bring up anything useful in locating Elijah, but Alex didn’t think he could be that far. After all, Klaus had to stash him before meeting them at the quarry. It left Alex having to use other avenues.Even though Klaus was a thousand-year-old vampire, he still left a paper trail or at least an electronic one. While he could use compulsion for most things, there were still traces of his life to follow. Robert had jumped on board to help Alex dig through financials to try and locate a place where one might store coffins with stake vampires inside. Klaus felt confident enough to leave his family there so it would be well protected.So Alex spent a lot of her time scrolling through documents. She enjoyed sitting on the front porch as she went about it, watching the world pass by and only stopping to stretch her legs when the screen would start to blur.Alex put down her coffee on the small table beside the porch swing and shifted the position of her laptop. She closed another document that had nothing of use and sighed as new documents came through via email. Robert had found a few possible leads and was chasing them up while also reaching out to an old friend – who wasn’t connected to the Council – and had them sending stuff through.She opened the new email and paused. A storage facility in the next town over. Payment for the facility was well beyond what Alex assumed would be the going rate for a unit, and the unit had only been rented out recently. The lease was only set for the month, and there was no renewal for the next month. It was a place that definitely held some promise.Alex noted down the address of the storage facility, the unit number and any other details she thought might be helpful before standing up. She carried her stuff back inside and grabbed her bag that was sitting on the kitchen table. It would take about an hour to drive to the next town, so there was no point in waiting.As she grabbed her bag, her phone started to ring. Alex pulled it out and frowned at the unknown number. She answered, “Hello?”“Alexandra, how disappointed we are.” The deep voice sounded smug as the man spoke.“And who would we be?” asked Alex.“My name is Richard Johnson; I am an Elder,” he explained.Alex wanted to hang up the phone, but this was her chance to warn them.The Council didn’t tend to let things go, but this time it was different. Renee was dead, Alex wanted nothing to do with them, and if they wanted to keep their operation going, she wasn’t interested in stopping them.Alex said, “Well, Richard, I don’t really care about disappointing you lot. Not anymore. After everything you have lied about, I think it’s best that we go our separate ways.”He said, “You have committed crimes against the Council, Alexandra. You will pay for those crimes.”“I don’t think so. After everything you have done, the crimes you have committed against our fellow witches, I have nothing to answer for. Renee deserved what she got, and she will answer for it on the other side. But I am done with all of it.”“You can never be done with the Council.”Alex smirked. “Yes, I can.”“I am a generous man, Alexandra, so here is my offer. Hand yourself over to receive your punishment, and your family will be left in peace. Sarah Hudson, James Hudson and Robert Malroy will be left in peace. Refuse to do so, and everyone you love will suffer.”Alex clenched her fist and said, “Here’s the thing, Richard. I just dealt with someone who threatened my family, and he is now sealed inside a coffin for the rest of his eternity. What do you think I’ll do to you if you come after my family? Klaus may be unkillable for now, but you are very much mortal, as is everyone else that you control. Just try it; you will regret ever having heard my name.”The silence on the line made it clear that they understood Alex’s threat.Richard said, “You would have filled your families seat well.”“You think I care about sitting on the Council?” she asked.“No, one of the reasons you would have suited it well, but there is another reason that the Ravenwood bloodline was removed from its seat. You all have such arrogance about you. It’s quite suffocating to deal with.” Richard sighed. “Take care of yourself, Alexandra. I look forward to meeting you.”The phone line went dead, and Alex shoved her phone into her pocket. One evil dealt with, and now she would have to face another.
  
    Chapter Text
    Even with Klaus sealed in a coffin, those that feared him still continued to do so when he could no longer threaten them. Several months after Alex had sealed him in that coffin, she had finally found a way to track Elijah and his siblings. Alex had managed to follow a witch and a few vampires all the way to Washington, where she killed the vampires and the witch, giving her access to the coffins.There were five in total.Alex had opened the first coffin to find a man, tall and with dark hair; the age on his face made him older than the others. Alex believed him to be Finn. The next coffin held a woman, blonde and young. Rebekah. The next was another man, this one younger, looking to still be a teen himself. He had to be Kol. The next coffin Alex hadn’t been able to open, she could sense the seal around it, reminding her of the one she had trapped Klaus with. The last coffin held Elijah.His skin was pale and the veins dark. The image burned in Alex’s mind as she reached out to grasp the hilt of the dagger. It felt like she had only just watched him get desiccated by Renee, but it had been months. Still, Elijah’s appearance made her feel ill.Stepping back from the coffin, Alex took a seat on a chair and pulled out a blood bag. She had bought more than she probably needed but wanted to be on the safe side.Alex didn’t know how long it would take for the effects of the dagger to wear off. It could be minutes, it could be hours, but she was going to wait. As she did, Alex admired the dagger that had put Elijah down. It was simple enough, infused with magic to make it strong but useless with the ash of a white oak tree. Alex would need to make sure the stakes were no longer an option for anyone, especially if Klaus got out and wanted to start stabbing his siblings again.The shift of a body made Alex’s head snap up. Elijah was no longer lying in the coffin; he was standing beside it. One hand was gripping the wood, and the strain on his face told Alex everything. He was starving and holding himself back. Alex grabbed the blood bag and threw it towards him.She smiled at him warmly and said, “Have at it.”Elijah looked relieved at the blood and tore into the blood. He gulped it down greedily before gasping in air. The colour of his skin lightened by his eyes were still dark. Alex grabbed another bag, handing it over, and then a third before Elijah pushed away from the coffin.Alex watched him and couldn’t help but let out a small squeal as he grasped her arm and pulled her into his chest. One arm wrapped around her waist while the over cupped her face and brought her head up so he could kiss her. It was deep and firm; the sparks that Alex had felt burst to life, and for the first time in months, Alex felt complete.Elijah’s kiss deepened quickly; his tongue found its way into her mouth and danced with hers. He pressed their bodies together, Alex’s body burning with heat and need just as he did. Alex tangled her fingers in his hair and groaned when he moved his mouth to nip at her throat.“How long?” he asked, his words muffled.She said, “A few months.”Elijah pulled back slightly and leant his forehead against hers. “Klaus?”“Desiccated and sealed in a coffin.”Elijah smiled. “You won.”Alex nodded. She would explain everything later, but she wanted to get them home first. “I did. And I found your siblings.”Elijah glanced at the coffins around them. “Where are we?”“Washington. I had to track down Klaus’ lackies to find you. It took time, but I didn’t let them stop me.” Alex smiled.“Thank you,” he whispered. He kissed her again.This was right, being with Klaus. In the time that had passed, Alex knew exactly what she wanted, and she was going to fight for it.“Did you bring enough blood for my siblings?” Elijah asked.Alex nodded. “I did, but I thought we could get everyone back to Mystic Falls and then wake them up. That way, we can get them all climatised to the modern world in an easier space.”Elijah stroked her cheek. “That is brilliant.”Alex smirked. “That’s cause it was my idea.”Elijah chuckled, then said, “Why did you bring Klaus with you?”Alex frowned. “I didn’t.”“Then why is there a spare coffin?” he asked.Alex paused. She’d been hoping Elijah could explain that to her. She said, “It’s sealed shut; I have no idea.”
