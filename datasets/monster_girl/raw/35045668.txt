    Chapter 1"1000..."The chiseled man finished his morning training, the training he's been doing since his earlier days, he would swing his sword in various stances whiles doing his footwork until 1000 strikes for each stance was achieved, his body screamed with pain and burning but at this point he didn't care, he reached a point that destroying his own body like this even gave him some pleasure, he trained not only swords, he knew his weapon could fail him one day so he trained with sticks, spears and anything he could consider a weapon, even throwing rocks was acceptable."Today is the day i avenge my people".He's finally ready, his town was long gone, all his friends became nymphomaniacs, sometimes he would go back and watch it from afar, compared to that horrible night during his boyhood with all the moanings, screams and pink aura, nowadays they live a peaceful life, he could integrate himself back into his community and even find a wife if he chose so, but that would break his promise to a dear friend he lost on that day."Time to go, no thinking about the past, these ghosts will be my guides from now on"The man disappears into the winds, his objective the responsible for all of this, the Demon Lord and her Daughters, he had knowledge, he read the encyclopedia, took note of most monsters features, sadly the author never met with the Demon Lord herself and he would have to challenge her blindly, a great risk this was, he knew that corruption would be his biggest enemy, no one could escape from it, not even the most chaste and strong heroes could, but he steeled himself for the task even so.Days after during a full moon night close to the forest"Each time i defeat one of them i feel stronger, life is easy nowadays compared those times i had to scurry and hide like a rat from my pursuers"The man promptly defeated every monster he met on his journey, he was nowhere close to his final objective, but was satisfied with the results, his newest victory was fending off a pack of werewolves, their scratching and biting was dangerous and could fell him if he was not careful, but with knowledge he knew evasion was key during that encounter, after defeating them, the monsters declared him their alpha and wanted to reward his success with the pleasures of the flesh, he refused their advances and disappeared shattering their hearts in the process making them go back with their tails between their legs, except one who followed him even if he refused them.A lone werewolf the most stubborn of that pack keeps ambushing him when he least expects and gets promptly defeated with whatever he has on hand, he's grateful to the monster for it, fending her off when he least expects trained him to hone his senses more and more, he had a rival who could train and improve him further."Will you stop refusing me and accept being my alpha already! ahhhhhh!" the girl screamed after a new defeat."I Will follow you to the ends of the land you hear me hubby~" the girl promised then followed him.Many days after after passing by a monster raiding camp"Defeating them increased my strength even further"This time he meet with a band of orcs, monsters renowned by their brute force, each strike of theirs felt like his everything was being crushed, this battle was hard fought and from his peripheral vision he saw the wolf who always pestered him filled with worry, he couldn't lose, his rival wouldn't accept that, his friend in his memories wouldn't accept that, he wouldn't accept that, the warrior learned midbattle how to redirect their power, if a human couldn't defeat a unstoppable force then just redirecting it would be enough, luckily the orcs were clumsy, so assured in their victory they let the ego rise up their heads and after half an hour of effort and parrying he defeated them."How can it be? How a weak human could ever defeat us!" they complained before submitting completely and offering themselves to the winner, only to be refused much to their disappointment."I have no need for this, only power is what i seek" the man said before going away, the werewolf rejoiced, her alpha wouldn't fall for them, she still had a chance."If power is what you seek i'll make you mine!" a lone orc of the band, the spunkiest of the group who gave him the most trouble followed him not long after.Now the warrior was either being ambushed by the werewolf or the orc, his senses were honed further, his combat skills as well, it didn't take long before both attacked together after reaching an agreement on sharing him, hopefully before he found a new addition to his harem of losers."I should be thankful to you, each time i rise in victory i grown more and more, my objective is closer each day" the man thought to himself after fending off the duo again."Please won't you even consider about giving us a chance? we are thirsty here!" they complained to deaf ears.Many days after when seeking refuge from the rain inside a cave"I challenge you! A duel to the death, prepare yourself!" the reptilian girl said and the hidden werewolf and orc complained, all their work would be undone now if she won and a new rival would appear soon if she lost.This time he fought a lizardman, a race know for their battle craze and finesse, he hoped to fight a salamander because that would provide even more battle training for him once she began following him, never his old self at the start of his quest for power and vengeance would think he would employ the help of monsters to further himself to greater heights.The battle was fierce, the werewolves fought with the instinct of an animal making him focus on evasion since they only needed a single hit, the orcs fought with the pride and ego of the strong and fell to their own hubris by having their power parried, but this woman fought him as a warrior, many were the times when he was cut, knocked down, punched and kicked, her tail provided her with another weapon and would whip him when he least expected much to the horror of the wolf and the orc who by now were cheering for his victory either they would lose their chance forever.There was no room to take a breath or disengage, this was a duel to the "death" as she said, of course "death" in this case would be she winning and raping him into becoming hers, since he already proven himself to be a great warrior, to him it was true death, the death of his ideals, his journey, his promise he wouldn't have any of it so he resorted to playing dirty.As a warrior the lizardman was honor bound to fight within a set of rules and codes, he was not, he only seeks power for his vengeance the means to achieve it not mattering, when he thought about it, finding a lizard woman was a blessing, if he fought a salamander his tactics wouldn't work and would only incite her battle craziness more, after reflecting on this the man was humbled during this fight, he too let ego rise up his head and almost lost becoming a failure of an warrior in the process.After fighting dirty with grappling, throwing sand at her eyes, attacking the blind spots and even resorting to pleasure attacks since he knew the straight laced warrior monsters were weak to it, the cheering werewolf and orc booed because of his intimacy with the new girl when he didn't bat them even an eye, after long he finally achieved his victory, dirty as it was he was the winner and now he had a new sparring rival to train with."You fight dirty, you are no warrior! But you won even still! AHHHHHH! Please take me as yours hubby~" The girl took off her armor and seduced him, her beautiful muscular body a beautiful sight to gaze upon almost making him fall for the temptation."Thanks for helping me achieve greater heights, and for making me realize i was a fool blinded by ego but i refuse, i seek more strength still" the man left and a lizard woman, who by now was red as a salamander with frustration vowed her revenge before following him, she met with the werewolf and the orc and with just their gazes a silent agreement was made.The man next days were hectic to say the least, the lizard woman trained the wolf and the orc to be better warriors and the difficulty in fending them off increased greatly with it, he wouldn't be lying in saying he regretted not having finished them before, but now it was too late, if the difficulty increased so be it, he would devour them and increase his strength in the process, even more powerful beings awaited him in the future and he needed every scrap of power he could attain."You have 3 of us already, we promised to share, if you want power so much why don't you sleep with us!""We bet that you would be a strong incubus if you weren't so stubbooooorn!""C'mon how can you blueball a woman like this!"After a hard fought battle he fended off his ambushers once again before resuming his quest.Days after when crossing the mountains"Oh look, another one..." the Lizard woman sighed."We'll be cheering for you, go and defeat her already so we can have a new partner~" the orc said"With the way you're doing things, i doubt you'll be able to stay in your journey for long, we only need a single victory after all~" the werewolf teasedHe knew that, he knew this was almost suicidal and soon enough his hubris would be his downfall, he learned to rein his ego after the fight with the lizard woman and not underestimate his enemies, as they said they only needed to win once and it was over, his only relief was that they also needed to sleep at night, after fighting him so much during the day everyone would be too spent to try to rape him in his sleep."Ohooo, so the little man is making a harem huh, and what is this, none of the girls has laid a claim to you yet?" the newcomer sniffed the thickness of his unreleased spirit energy, this was a good catch."What do you know about us!" the Lizardman complained."We have been trying for a week now, and he's only getting stronger!" the orc added."I bet you too will be part of his harem of losers soon enough~" the orc teased.Complaints and curses were throw at the newcomer."What a bad man, you have so many girls offering their love to you and yet you don't fulfill their dreams, why so?" the Ogre licked her lips, this catch would be good."I seek only power, they follow me from their own accord, they aren't my objective""Ohoo and what that objective would be?"."Defeat me and i'll tell you"."Very well!" the woman rushed at him with a punch that cracked the earth.The warrior jumped back, this battle would be just like the orc group, but all that power was being held by one single person, he tried to parry and redirect her strikes but as expected the ogress was too strong to be moved, redirecting her power was unthinkable so he decided to use speed instead."C'mon 'cmon the little man will only run away? where is the warrior who would defeat me and add him to his harem?" the Ogre taunted trying to snap his concentration, it didn't work.With dexterity and evasion he knew he would fight the long fight, he knew this was the most dangerous enemy yet, the only thing waiting for him was rape bone breaking rape at that, he sidestepped her punches, jumped at her sweeps, cut when he had the chance then retreated, slowly her body was bleeding all over but she wasn't worse for the wear."Finally a good opponent, dude when i finish with you i'm gonna turn your pelvis into powder!".Somehow the Ogre got a rage boost and her ferociousness increased to the horror of the cheering girls."Don't lose man! Please my dear, not to her! She would never share!"."Awww the girlies are afraid the bad bad Ogre will take you away~ They are right you know, i would never share my meat with someone else!".The ogre punches and stomps raised earth pillars that made it harder and harder to evade, the man tried to calm his mind and analyze the situation, the bitch was trying to make an arena and close them off!."No you won't! I will devour you and add your strength to my own!" the man also entered a state of rage, remembering his trauma he superimposed the image of those raiders at the Ogre."Be thankful to your nature and your strength, it's time i put my training results to the max!".The man slashed at one of the ogre stone pillars breaking his sword in the process, but getting a rock club on its place he began bashing her while dogding her strikes by a hair width."Go hubby go!" the trio cheered at the comeback."THIS IS MORE LIKE IT!" the woman rage became arousal, she was hurting all over from the bashing with a rock club and could feel her bones breaking, the warrior skill was good she had to admit, she tried to defend herself and strike at him but the man was slippery he was fighting a risky game one hit of hers would be enough to end it but the man refused to be hit."FALL ALREADY!" He broke his club at her skull, if it was any other girl she would be dead but the Ogre just passed out."You were a worthy opponent, thank you for helping me attain strength" he took his broken sword and began to leave but the Ogre woke up and with a lusty gaze spoke."You got the right of being my husband, my equal, but you don't want that right? You said you need power!? Get ready hubby~ this beautiful me won't let you be in peace ever again~" the woman promised and he accepted her threat before going away."Welcome to the team of losers~" the orc said."Let's get hubby together!" the werewolf added."I'll make a warrior out of you be ready!" the lizardman happy to get a new student added."SHUT UP YOU LOSERS, I ONLY NEED MYSELF, I WON'T SHARE THAT TASTY MEAT WITH ANY OF YOU!" they got scared for one second then giggled at her threat."Once again welcome to our team, it's your loss if you don't want to work together, bye then~" they left the Ogre to lick her wounds before going after them.Many Days after inside the Alra forest."How do you plan in fending us off now that you don't have a weapon hubby~" the girls put him against a wall, luckily for him he was traveling through a forest and had lots of sticks to spare, his trusty sword at his belt, he didn't find yet a place to forge its blade anew."This forest is my weapon, get ready!" the warrior proclaimed after ripping a branch from a tree.After a hard fought battle, the girls lay defeated complaining and aroused at the man who doesn't give them what they truly want but also can't help to follow him, each victory making him stronger and his spirit tastier, they felt fulfilment just from being around him."ahhh if only he injected them with that thick creamy spirit as well"."I know you are there, come out and fight!" the warrior challenged and soon enough the selfish Ogre appeared."You know what? I'M FUCKING PISSED, GET READY BECAUSE TODAY YOUR PELVIS WILL BE NO MORE!"The battle was hard fought, actually if not for the blessings of the forest he would've lost since she learned her lesson and struck him with precise movements instead of her pillars, refusing to give him new weapons from the earth, he promised himself to stock up and polish his sticks after ripping more branches and adding to his collection."FUCK YOU, DAMMIT DUDE, POUND MY PUSSY ALREADY, HAVEN'T YOU PROVED YOURSELF ENOUGH?! YOUR BODY WON'T SURVIVE IF YOU GO DOWN FURTHER IN THIS PATH" the battle crazed Ogre screamed shaking the forest and scaring the birds, the woman spoke harshly but she also was worried, the man had rich spirit energy but in the end he was just human, he hadn't the increased strength and stamina of a incubus, what if he died from all the strain and effort he was putting his body through, she wouldn't accept this, she wouldn't accept such a joke of a ending to the one she loved."I can't, this is nowhere close to the power i need to defeat her, if i have to fall during my journey it only proves i wasn't worthy of it" the warrior spoke, his rivals cared for him and he began caring for them, but he wouldn't stop until he achieved his goals, not only for the promise he made during his childhood but also to not dishonor the power he gained from training with these girls after surviving their advances everyday.The warrior walked away, leaving behind the worried girls."He defeats all of us constantly, he's strong he won't fall so easily"."I'm sure once he achieves what he's searching for he'll come back for us and we'll give him all the love he needs~"."So let's do our best and increase our power to always provide him a challenge and make him climb to greater heights!"."HOW CAN YOU... okay i'll try to play like a team, but if my strike is the one that puts him down i still call dibs and won't share!".Walking deeper inside the forest he found a old ruin, deciding to explore it he entered the place followed closely by the girls the warrior found himself in a place full of riches."Woa look at this dude, we struck gold lets grab everything and use it to live the good life!" the pillaging orc said."Just don't grab the silver please" the werewolf added."So many quality weapons, i can't wait to use them!" the lizardman had stars in her eyes."HAH why you need to hoard treasure, you only need him, he's enough for our happiness" the Ogre facepalmed, did they lost sight of the main goal?.The warrior silently explored the room, his instincts warning this was too good to be true, before long he met with a demonic looking sword resting in a pedestal."Are you alive?" the man asked, he knew about cursed swords, if the weapon wasn't claimed yet he could make it his, he would get a nice weapon with the only downside being of it wanting to turn everyone into monsters, not that it mattered since he only fought monsters, but if the weapon already possessed a woman this would be a fight he wouldn't want do."..." the sword didn't answer."Just to make sure..." the warrior attacked.CLANG"As expected, nothing comes so easily" he was parried, a woman with a murderous grin instantly formed from the sword and parried his strike."You already have a owner, sorry but using you won't bring me the strength i desire!" he readied himself for battle, before the entire place rumbled and he watched in horror the door to the place closing."OGRE HOLD THE DOOR!" the warrior exclaimed."And why should i~ this is our chance after all, you being locked in here with all of us wouldn't last long heh!" the Ogre grinned at him"You finally will be ours hubby~!" the werewolf added"... hold me and make my strength yours" the Cursed sword emotionless voice offered."And to think i considered you a dear rival..." the Warrior spoke with regret, he mellowed too much why he lowered his guard before the things that brought his childhood such suffering, just because they provided him with constant challenge? Their objective always was to finally defeat then rape him since he kept refusing to enact his right as the victor and fuck them himself."So this is where we part ways... Come my rival, my journey for power may be over, but we all will meet in the underworld!" the Warrior proclaimed and got ready to fight, much to the shock of the girls accompanying him his determination told them this wouldn't be a friendly spar for self improvement, for the one chance of escaping he would fight with the intent to kill and if all else failed kill himself."Ah, uh... OH C'MON HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO KEEP UP WITH THIS IF YOU ACT LIKE THAT, CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND I WAS JUST TEASING DAMMIT!" the Ogre punched the closing doors of the ruins and exploded it in a million fragments before going out stomping the ground."...Thanks" the Warrior was grateful, he didn't expect this change of heart in one of his fiercest opponents."FUCK YOU, I HOPE THAT SWORD TURNS YOU INTO HER SCABBARD!" The Ogre cursed."That was low... we know our nature as monsters make us want to fuck you senseless, but the way you spoke to us as if we betrayed you, it hurts" the wolf followed with her tail lowered with sadness."Hubby needs to train his knowledge about a girl's heart..." the orc pockets filled with riches was gone."Going down fighting for your life, was something dreamy that would make any warrior proud, but you said it with such regret as if everything was lost, i'm ashamed of your actions my dear rival" the Lizardman was crestfallen."..." the Cursed sword watched this drama silently."I need to ask for their forgiveness later, hopefully without them asking to rape me for compensation" the Warrior said before focusing his anger to the girl."You, you are the reason for all of this, i won't forgive you Cursed sword, i would gladly accept to hold you as my new weapon had you not possessed this girl, but since you were corrupted already i have no use for you, say your prayers!" the Warrior as an act of defiance and wanting to not only defeat but humiliate this sword pulled out his own, the sword that broke during the battle with the Ogre, no sane man would ever use such a weapon, but he for a moment forgot what sanity was."HAHAHAHAHAH" The girl eyes shone red, her smile contorted her face with murdering glee, this man would be a great scabbard for her, she could feel his potential more than anyone else.The girl slashes were precise, she had experience from drinking the blood and spirit of many battlefields before being sealed for who knows how long, each cut sending a shockwave destroying the area, the explosions alerted the girls outside to the danger, even thought they were angry and feeling betrayed by the man, they couldn't help but worry for him and peeked inside to see what was happening."HOW, WHY, WHAT THE FUCK YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING YOU IDIOT!" The Ogre was pissed off, the guy really was fighting the Cursed Sword with a broken one? was he thinking with his balls instead of his brains? did he think this was a joke? she wasn't laughing.The warrior wanted to prove a point and didn't care about the criticism he was getting, then stabbed the girl with his broken blade, he felt like he was stabbing metal."Of course it's a projection, you've been together for so long i doubt she even has a flesh body anymore" he said while evading the demonic slashes."Even if her body is metal i doubt her eyes are as resistant" He parried her strike with a shield he found in this place, the shield was cut like butter and his arm was struck, he instantly felt his strength leaving, this was the worst part of dealing with cursed swords if they are by themselves they are a boon to your strength as high quality weapons, if not they damage your spirit after each successful slash."This will be good practice for when i need to confront the Lilims!" the Warrior roared and attacked again forgoing defense and parrying in favor of pure evasion."THAT IDIOT WANTS TO WHAT? HE'S HAVING TROUBLE WITH A SWORD AND HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY HE WILL CONFRONT A LILIM? MADNESS!""So dreamy~ if he wins vs a Lilim imagine how tasty he will be~"."I hope once he becomes famous like that he still remembers about us..."The man tried to go for the eyes, the beast in front of him had eyes all over but firstly he would blind the woman, sensing the danger to its host the sword began protecting her eyes during the battle, this made her offensive capabilities drop since she wasn't focused only on attacking anymore, a grave mistake, for the man just needed to pierce the other eyes, and pierce the eyes he did, beginning with the one in her neck."...!" The cursed sword flinched, that one was part of its true main body how could this cur treat her like this! rage filled her head before being overwritten by desire, such violence was something she didn't see in ages, now she wanted more than ever to be held by him."HAH!" The woman slashed around, red liquid spilling from the blade it had the power to cut things all around where it splashed, the man was pushed back by this, the liquid was dangerous, this opened him for her advance and a new cut was made."Hnnnng!" the man felt his heart beat faster and faster and throbbing all over, if he got cut again it would be over, he needs to blind the girl now and take the upper hand, then just like he did with the lizard girl he dropped his defenses and extended his arm as if in a trance, the raspniess of his voice helping it."Come here, let me hold you" He extended his hand not to the sword but the girl who looked at him, warily the red eye in the blade contracted and expanded trying to guess his intentions."..." she stopped looking at the gasping man looking desperate to touch her."Grab the bait!" His was a risky gamble, he didn't attach to the sword yet as its "holder", there was a chance of calming her down and winning with a surprise attack if she opened her guards long enough for him to get inside."my holder, my scabbard~ 3" the emotionless girl walked to him offering herself up, the nature of a monster girl winning in the end."Yes my dear, i will hold you" He patted her head and slowly with both hands caressed her face to which she could only smile wanting him to hold her more.clench poke"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" The girl lost her vision, to the horror of the monsters watching this, what their beloved did was the ultimate act of cruelty, no one deserved this fate."NOW!""...!"The man pulled his sword out once again and pierced the eye of the Cursed Blade main body, which exploded in a jet of blood before fusing with his own broken Sword, the body of the girl disappearing inside it as well as reforging his old companion back to its heydays a reddish glow pulsating through it."You're there as well, don't worry i'll hold you as promised, now go and sleep peacefully my partner" He gave his farewells, once fused with the blade the girl wouldn't ever die, the cursed blade would reform again and again and bring her back with it, the only difference was that it now had a new host in the form of the blade the warrior lived his life with, maybe that connection with him would purify or at least tame the curse in the same way the living armor comes to be, only time would tell.The warrior got sucker punched and flew through the air luckily falling into a cushioned bed."YOU CUNT, HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HER!"."That was cruel, you filled her with promises then betrayed her right after""I don't know you anymore hubby...""That wasn't the way of the warrior..."The girls disappointment stung and he could only ask forgiveness."Sorry for saying the things i said, i shouldn't've jumped to conclusions and think you all betrayed me after spending so long with you all" the Warrior got up and sincerely apologized disarming the girls."Also sorry for using the methods i did in this battle but i guarantee you, the woman didn't suffer as you thought she did after so long being fused to it by this point she was so long gone, what you saw was just a projection the cursed sword used tempt men, soon enough she'll come back now that both inhabit my own blade, hopefully the curse will be tamed by then if my blade teaches them about my life until now" He assured them, not knowing if this was true or not he just reached this conclusion from reading the encyclopedia entry on it."Well... when you are so sincere like that how can we not forgive you" the werewolf spoke while her tail wagged happily."Also a Lilim huh? you horndog you really want to catch the big fish HAHA i like your greed!" the orc slapped his back approving his thirst."If hubby defeats a Lilim i wouldn't ever stop teasing her for it~" the orc couldn't wait, sweet revenge for being considered just cannon fodder during monster campaigns by the radical faction."This is why you need to win by any means possible... this makes me angry! the code! argh... But against a Lilim i can understand you, you don't need only strength in battle but in wits as well... i forgive you too my beloved" the Lizardman was conflicted but in the end also forgave the warrior."(your means reminded me of our heydays in the battlefield your thirst for blood is magnificent so i too forgive you, i'll work to convince her in forgiving you as well but be ready to pamper her lots when she recovers)" The sword spoke to his mind."NOW NOW NOW BACK TO BUSINES HEH HEH" The Ogre flexed."what do we have here, a bed~" the wolf smiled."And hubby is all battered up from his last fight~" the orc was salivating."Get ready, today we will force you to accept our strength and finally become a worthy incubus warrior!""(I won't help you with that, you can use this sword if you like but it'll be only at the strength of your old one, no enchantments for you heh~)" the Cursed Sword laughed."Come at me!" The Warrior smiled, his future would be bleak but he wouldn't bend or fail.

    Chapter 2"Hero oh hero" a voice called waking him up.The man found himself in a beautiful place above the clouds"Did i die?" the warrior thought while looking around, he just had a chance to sleep after fending off his rivals once again did his body fail him at last?"This is a dream my champion, the Chief God watches your quest with great interest and is proud on how you refuse the advances of the monsters while also using them as a stepping stone to rise up above your limits by defeating them over and over" the voice explained."As a reward for your efforts, she sent me to be your battle maiden and help you in your journey" the owner of the voice revealed herself, a beautiful armored angel emanating strength."Valkyrie..." the warrior sized her up and felt her power, it would be a great boon to him if he defeated her even in a dream."Fight me" He took a stance making the battle maiden smile"Yes, it's only to be expected, a champion like you needs even more training, i accept your challenge my champion!" the scenery changed and now they were in the ruins of some battlefield filled with forgotten weapons and rubble."Let us begin!" she disappears with a flash, reappearing behind him and striking the man, sending him flying with the surprise attack."!" the warrior still in the air did a flip and stomped against a broken pillar in his way, focusing his power he jumped at the floating Valkyrie and slashed at her wings, this would be his first flying enemy and a strong one at that."If you can't bring me down you'll have no chance against the Lilim my champion!" she flew above his reach and kicked the man rocketing him to the ground."Strong, thank you for this chance!" the warrior rose up and brushed the dust off his body, before grabbing a rock and throwing it like a bullet at the girl."Using rocks against me, you think this is a joke my champion?" it exploded before reaching her making a cloud of dirt in the process."To win against impossible odds one also needs strength of the mind Valkyrie" the warrior kept grabbing pebbles and rocks from around the arena and shooting them like bullets at her wings, none of them hit the girl and kept exploding before reaching her, soon the entire air was filled with dust hiding him from the battle maiden."So this was your plan, but what about it? Many high tier monsters can find you with their eyes closed, they just needs to focus at your spirit which by now is as bright as a lighthouse in the darkness" the Valkyrie was disappointed, but soon she felt the danger and evaded, a spear appeared from the dust almost piercing the maiden."Weapons don't have spirit, if they focus too much at me, then they lose sight of that which can defeat them" his voice came from the dust before many weapons were throw at the maiden from different angles and spots, she deflected some and exploded others but some weapons in this battlefield bypassed her aura which was responsible for exploding the rocks before, and finally shredded her wings making the maiden fall."Hubris of the strong huh?" the Valkyrie approved the man, not every champion had to fight shackled by honor, all means were acceptable in the quest to defeat monsterkind even the traitor hero Arthur employed the help of a monster to defeat the Old Demon Lord after all, sadly he fell for the temptations of said monster and put her in the throne right after."You've passed the first trial, let's continue" the girl fought him at his playing field now.Pulling another spear from the ground the warrior threw it at her while running behind it with his sword, the Valkyrie deflected it only to be met with a slash targeting her neck, she tried to parry but it was a feint, the warrior swept at her legs making her fall then mounted the maiden making her blush for a moment before feeling the danger and kicking him off her after the warrior tried to stab her face."That was a good move, but do not underestimate the charms of a Lilim if you try it with them, trying to mount her is a risky gamble that can make you lose instantly, they can finish you off with their corruption much earlier than you can even think on dealing the final strike" the woman warned her champion."I'll take it to heart" the warrior also knew the risk, using his body as bait trying to weaponize their instincts against them was a desperate gamble he did with the Cursed sword, but he doubted would work with a witty monster like a Lilim.They fought more in this dreamscape, training for what felt like weeks without end, finally the warrior defeated the Valkyrie, who by now was battered, a sorry visage compared to before, she smiled with approval at him before shining with gold and recovering instantly to her former grace and glory."My dear champion, for opening my eyes to my own hubris, you now have my blessing" the battle maiden touched his scarred chest and blushed a little not wanting to let go."When you wake up you'll find yourself with far more stamina, endurance and agility than before, may this be enough to help you in your journey" she smiled"Can we spar again in the future" this week was eye opening to him, and if he could train even in his dreams his journey would be easier in the future."I Would love to~" she kissed the warrior before everything disappeared into white.At the morning"I feel stronger than ever, i think i could run all the way from my hometown and back without feeling the strain" the warrior spoke after yawning, his spirit flared up waking his companions up with the biggest woman boners ever since knowing him."If you are stronger now how about you give your loved rivals some nice thick and milky breakfast hubby~""I could totally go for eggs and sausage right now~""(she's anxious to meet you again, be ready)""OH YEAH DUDE, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, DIBS ON THE COOK AND THE COCK!" The Ogre jumped at him and he evaded her magnificently."I got a new partner in my dreams, you better train more because i'll be getting stronger each night hahahah" The warrior laughed while being attacked by everyone including his sword."Oh you cheater~ Not fair hubby~ a new partner needs approval from us it's the rule! Grrr another one to share with damn!" they complained.Many days afterThe party reached the outskirts of holy town Lescatie, this being the first time the warrior saw the city of legendary heroes he almost wanted to rush inside and spar with them before being stopped by his traveling companions."I dislike this place..." the werewolf was wary of her surroundings feeling like a newborn pup afraid of the world"sniff sniff This entire area feels wrong" the orc girl was being riled from somewhere a delicious smell threatened to take over her mind"What a bunch of pussies, i bet i could beat them all to a pulp!" the Ogre looked at the town and wanted to raid it"Lescatie, the city of heroes this was my goal before meeting you my dear, to find and battle a hero then be taken by him, thankfully i've met you instead~" the lizardman confessed"(I feel the presence of a Lord in this area, be careful she's strong)" his partner warned him"I can feel it too, let us search for the source" the warrior gave a final look at the town then walked inside the dense forest, not noticing he was being watched from the shadows."So much spirit~ He's as bright as the sun ahnnn i want to drink it allllll~" a Demon was wet looking at her prey, before disappearing."He's dangerous, target for assassination, must report" a Kunoichi also spoke before disappearing."Nii-chan is lovely" an adorable Baphomet added, wanted to be held and pampered by the man before also disappearing to tell her sisters about the catch."He's strong, my pussy aches~ let's get him girls we got our new breeding stallion!" An Amazon was riled up and called her tribe to seek him.After walking around the warrior sensed the danger and evaded a arrow aimed at his back before turning around at his assailant."Hehe, you have fine senses, it makes hunting you much more rewarding~" the Amazoness spoke."So you are the source of their concern..." He readied himself before parrying another arrow from the forest."So many strong girls accompanying you, yet i feel no demonic energy from yourself, you are searching for your true queen aren't you~ you don't need to anymore now we all will be your owners~" She raised her hand and a hail of arrows rained down on him."You strength comes from numbers and tactics, you are far more organized than a werewolf pack or a orc raiding camp" the warrior made her whistle when he slashed above and cut every arrow that would hit him."Fight me, as a warrior, put the lives of your entire tribe against me! be the pillar that pushes me greater heights!" He advanced."You heard him girls, he accepts being our stallion if we win, ROAR for today we are blessed with a great hunt!"Roars came from all around the place.The warrior struck at the leader while evading arrows from all over, their coordination was on point, not a single arrow ever touched her body, passing through her hair, under her arms, between her legs, everything was aimed at him from all directions, he felt like he was fighting the rain itself and thanked the valkyrie blessing of agility and stamina.The leader was having the time of her life, who cared about the invasion? If she brought him to her tribe it was enough, this man would provide everyone the strongest babies once she won, then she pulled her giant sword and fought.clang slash boom crash parry sidestep roll stab feint punch kick jump sweepThe duo danced under a rain of arrows, not letting the other ever get the upper hand, if his sword was anything else it would be broken by now, for no normal weapon could defeat the massive thing being swung at him, he should thank the cursed blade later."(no problem, just show me how bloodthirsty you can get and defeat her hahahaha! she's also cheering for you so don't disappoint her)" his partner was having fun before warning him."(be careful you got company!)" the Amazons were rushing out from their hiding planning to gank up on him.clang slash cut parry evade parry block kick punch jump kick run"You're slippery but how long until you get tired and makes mistakes~ GET HIM GIRLS" The chieftain teased, he was surrounded by 10 amazons fighting with everything they had, others kept the arrow support and some were trying to distract him with sensuality making a lesbian show for the man who couldn't help to pop a boner."We should've tried that before, write it down!" the werewolf and orc spoke."THE HELL? NO WAY I WOULD DO THAT WITH ANY OF YOU, MY BODY IS ONLY FOR HIM, HEY DUMBASS BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF THEM ALREADY!" The Ogre made a fuss while also pushing back some amazons who looked at her beautiful muscular body with stars on their eyes."T-that's too shameless, a-as a warrior i too refuse to do it!" the lizardman also was attacked for the same reason.The warrior faster than a grizzly climbed the trees around him to escape and take a breath, calming down he focused again, this place was full of demonic energy that was crawling inside him telling to let it go and fall to their pleasures."This is not normal, reveal yourself!" the man slashed at a empty spot behind him before evading another hail of arrows, space distorted and a blue skinned figure that filled him with thoughts of lust appeared."Ku ku ku, you really are tasty you know what, wouldn't you accept my help? just sign my contract and you all can escape safely~ or maybe i could fill you with unimaginable pleasure~" her magic wormed its way inside his mind making him stop for a moment thinking about her offer."(NO YOU WON'T YOU DUMBASS, NOT AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO ME AND HER, CUT THIS BITCH DOWN AND BE DONE WITH IT!)" The sword screamed at his mind snapping him out of the Demon control."So you found yourself a cursed sword and reached an agreement~ it seems the usual ways won't be enough, get ready my dear i will taste you by force then~""Thank you my partner" the warrior focused, now that the cursed sword would snap him back to reality the Demon's mind control wouldn't be as useful.The woman sent a wave of darkness followed by wet tentacles at the man which he cut down to shreds, the cursed sword being her natural nemesis drinking her power with each slash was making it harder for the demon to fight back, not only that each cut of the sword also clouded her own mind with horniness making her stumble about with the pleasure she was forced to feel, soon enough the Demon was panting and moaning hard on top of the branch both were and was completely finished with a skull rocking orgasm when she was turned into a pincushion by the demon silver arrows of the amazons that kept attacking."(Blergh, her taste was bad, ahh i want to vomit now)" the Cursed sword complained."Thanks" the warrior was grateful."(I warn you beforehand, i drank too much of it, when she appears she will be completely out of control hehe)" the Cursed sword had fun"Noted..." The warrior wouldn't have any rest today, then he jumped down back into the amazon horde."It's time to finish this..." His voice cold, his heartbeat calm, the influence of that Demon almost made him lose today and he was reminded of the Valkyrie words about the stronger ones being able to charm him before he could even think on attacking them.The amazons were wary of the man who could beat a Demon, that wariness dissipated when it became clear his worth as a hunt increased once again and attacked him together.The warrior was like water now, with serenity he evaded every attack while also dealing a decisive blow to his assailants, his fluid movements carried him around until only he and the chieftain were standing in this battleground."You are truly worthy of being our husband, no your power made you be worthy of being our chieftain, wouldn't you accept taking us all as your wives?" the chieftain offered."Sorry but the one thing i seek is strength, strength far above what i have now and the power to not ever fall to your corruption" with that he defeated the chieftain and once again felt his body rejoicing at the victory."Hubby~" the lizardman appeared filled with happiness from her shining knight newest victory trying to embrace him.slash"How did you know?" with her disguise undone, a shocked kunoichi appeared kneeling from the cut."I've lived with them for weeks, the only thing they do after my battles is try to rape me thinking this is their chance" he smiled at the woman and a bunch of flustered complaints was heard from the girls still trying to unglue themselves from the lesbian amazons."You're too dangerous.." she readied herself before offered his hand and shocked her once again."Come with me" the warrior said, holding her hand in this position made him look like her superior."What?" the kunoichi's legs lost their strength and she fell to her knees."(get ready for tonight man, she's furious now)" the Cursed sword said."WHAT? WHY ARE YOU INVITING HER WHEN YOU NEVER DID THE SAME TO US!" The Ogre after knocking the amazons off came with a punch, which the man evaded, then the others also came making the Ninja gaze upon this strange party warily."I know about your kind, once your assassination plan fails, you swear your loyalty to the master who defeated you, in this case me" he said while evading the attacks of his other companions, the kneeling kunoichi was unable to decide if she should attack him or let him continue."As your new master, i order you, become my traveling partner and together with them keep ambushing me with your subterfuge skills, your reward if for winning is my body and making me fall, my reward if i win is living yet another day as a human and honing my strength even further" the warrior's tone said he was sure he would always win and put her down at her place, this made the kunoichi latent masochistic thoughts ablaze like a volcano."My master~" The cold faced kunoichi had a dopy smile under her mask, her dream was achieved before the invasion ever began.Ending note:the kunoichi was added too easily to the harem, and she had some divergences to the entry in the encyclopedia? well i took my liberties and made her personality like the ones you meet in Monster Girl Dreams and Taimanin (after being broken hehehe~).
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 3The defeated amazons were in awe watching his fight with his partners, the man didn't rest even after defeating their tribe and the Demon, the warrior was worthy of being their chieftain, if only he took them for himself and exerted his right as the victor to breed the losers, they would be more than happy in serving him forever as their tribe would be blessed with the strongest babies, but they knew such a man wouldn't accept being shackled to just one place, his life was one of strife and struggles to one day reach the peak, some of them entered the fray once again, to help his companions at defeating him, but their coordination wasn't good with the other monsters and they bothered them more than they could help and eventually he rose up as the victor once again."Dreamy, he's truly worthy to be hunted, the biggest catch i've ever seen" The current chieftain spoke after falling to her knees once again, to which her tribe agreed"Should i follow him and try to capture the man like these girls accompanying him tried to everyday?""Could i dedicate my entire futures to this one person or should i follow the fourth born plan and raid Lescatie for easy pickings?"This doubt weighted on each single amazoness minds, eventually they reached a consensus, the tribe was the most important and they wouldn't throw it away for one person but they wouldn't stop those that wanted to from following him, to the surprise of everyone though every girl wanted to follow the warrior, we would be their honorary chieftain from now on even if he didn't want to."Well hubby get ready because you really won't have any rest from now on~" the Orc teased"How long can you survive with an army following you heh you lady killer~" together with the Werewolf"I give my condolences to your pelvis dude, i will destroy it first but even after it becomes powder you won't have any rest" the Ogre mocked with a praying gesture"A entire tribe of warriors, let's share some pointers later~ everything to hone our skill and give husband dearest a hell of a time!" the Lizard preached and the Amazons roared in agreement."(Man the way things are going, this will become bad real fast are you sure you want to thread down this path? it's Hel you're walking into)" The cursed sword was concerned, during his era he never met a man who was so battle thirsty he left his enemies alive and even brought them with him knowing they would try to kill the man over and over, the sword really wanted his holder to finish them off and run away with just him and the girl.After defeating his partners once again together with the amazons tribe and the kunoichi as per his request, only the Demon remained without giving him a shot, when he looked at the place he left her pincushioned visage there was nothing there, sighing to himself the warrior gazed upon the Kunoichi and asked."Now tell me why so many different kinds monsters are gathered in here?""Couldn't you guess it already master, we are planning on invading Lescatie""The city of heroes, you all plan to begin a war against the strongest town we know?" the warrior was shocked with this, how full of themselves these monsters are thinking they could deal with the strongest heroes?"They'll fall, we have our insiders doing a nice job at taking down the important targets~ and one very special person helping us with inteligence~" she spoke in a teasing tone"It explains the Demon from before, tell me what other high level monsters are in here" he wanted to know his future enemies, maybe if the defeated them somehow he would be strong enough to challenge the Demon Lord and her daughters."The fourth born herself is leading this Crusade""By the Fallen God" his companions gasped, with a monster army and the fourth borne leading it, this town has fallen already, just the fourth borne was enough for it, the army was more of a ornament for her."Maybe i should challenge her..." the Warrior muttered."Please don't master, i've seen how you fight, you're not at her level yet, she will just toy with you and then throw you away to be raped by her entire camp" the amazons cheered agreeing with the woman."I'm that bad still?" the warrior was crestfallen at the evaluation of his new companion."It's not that, you seek a challenge that involves everyone attacking you at the same time to surpass all odds and rise to the top" she said to the agreement of everyone."Yup he's been suicidal like that since ever" the others said."If you do the same with her, she'll be more than happy in making her mages bombard you with all encompassing spells while she locks you down with her skills since she can easily resist being caught in the crossfire, in the end you'll be humiliated and creaming all over until you're reduced to a broken mess~" the Kunoichi would like to see this scene, her proud master being put in his place ahh the dream."This require a change of plans, ok i won't try to defeat them all, what do you say about me picking the stragglers and reducing her forces?" the Warrior needed wit in the next fight."That would be a wise plan" she agreed."(Careful, i felt that Demon wasn't the best they got, if there are more gathering intelligence for her, you would stick like a sore thumb and be found easily if you try that plan)""Noted, well then it's time to go" the warrior turned around and saw the amazon tribe gazing at him, a bead of sweat forming at his forehead."Welcome my new traveling companions, you are free to attack me whenever and even during my sleep, should you want" they cheered and made plans for the night watch, he couldn't have his guard up 24h soon he would fall because of his ego."But i too am free to attack you whenever and even during your sleep and night watches, if that means i'll have some hours of rest myself after knocking you out hahahahaha" he laughed and silenced the girls, was this guy human at all?"Welcome to our ever growing team of losers you all, soon enough we'll build a entire nation just for hubby~"A Demon hiding in the shadows laughed to herself before disappearing, her liege would also find this situation hilarious.Monster camp"So the man not only defeated an entire tribe of amazons alone, but also made them defect from our forces just so they could make him their chieftain, adding them and a kunoichi to his ever growing harem of monsters he keeps blue balling?" the white succubus surrounded by her generals had a eyebrow raised."Yup biggest laugh i had in a long time, they don't make them like this anymore Kufufufu" the Demon was amused and wanted to go back be part of his harem too."AAHAHAHAHAHAH this really made my day FUFUFUHAHAHAHAH ahh my sides hurt now, this is too much" the Lilim laughed like she hasn't since a long time and her generals laughed together."Onii-chan is so dreamy, but what a bad onii-chan treating them like this" a petite Baphomet, the one who first found him with the demon and the amazoness him giggled as well."And he even told them they are free to attack whenever they want, no matter the hour even when he sleeps KUKUFEHEHE""FUHAHAHAHAH stop it stop it, i can't anymoreeee~" The Lilim was interested in this newcomer, she never heard about such a man before, where did he even come from? One thing was certain though he was not a normal hero, either he would've killed the monsters long ago instead of making companions of them, or he would've fallen to their wiles after they lost and tried to entrance him with their bodies, none of which happened yet."I'm interested, maybe I'll finally show mommy someone i can call my husband, with the willpower he has can he endure my charms without breaking?" the Lilim asked."He was close to falling for my charms but he's a cursed sword holder, and it snapped his mind out of my spell before i got him for myself" the Demon pouted."Why didn't you ask to be part of his harem, surely you would have even more chances working together with the others" the Lilim was curious."You know my contract binds our souls together, it's something far more intimate than bonding through sex, what he's doing right now is cheating, and i bet the girls would try to beat me for robbing their man from them, they reached a consensus on sharing after all" the pitiful Demon pouted."Ah yes, sorry..." The Demon wanted him but her contract didn't permit more people on it, either she would bind the entire harem together for eternity so none would ever experience loss, with their lifespans being so diverse from one another."Well, once we finish this invasion i'll meet him myself, until then no trying to capture him you hear me?" the Lilim told to her generals."But if we find onii-chan during our patrols its fair game right~" the Baphomet spoke."Okay it's fair game, but no sudden change of your routes just to search for him, only if he comes to your area himself you can engage" her word was law."YEAH!"Later at the forest orphanageThe warrior explored the forest followed by his assailants who were laughing while having the time of their lives hunting him down and being fended off only getting hornier in the process, each skirmish made the amazons synchronize more with the other monsters, with time they would act like a single organism."Hmm what is this place?" he found himself into a church deep inside the forest."This is a orphanage for monsters sister Sasha set up not long ago" the monsters stopped their attacks to not to scare the children inside."Sasha, as in the hero Sasha Fullmoon?" the warrior couldn't imagine one of the strongest heroes protecting the monsters and caring for their young."Yes, she was heartbroken after being commanded by the Order to slaughter many villages that coexisted with us and when she was ordered to kill the young ones as well she defected from her hero duties and ran away, this is the place she brought those children to atone for her sins by caring for them" the Kunoichi explained."Hmmm, i can't fight someone like that, i doubt she even has the will to fight anymore" the warrior began walking away when the church doors opened and the nun was surprised seeing the man being surrounded by so many monsters."Errm hello?" The woman said with a strained smile looking at the man and his companions."Nii-chan!" a Baphomet appeared from inside the church and ran towards him, feeling the danger he evaded her."Buuu~ how can you treat me like this" the petite monster pouted."Do you know him?" the nun asked."Yes he's my big nii-chan, and future hubby as well~" He got ready for a battle."Ahh i see... please don't do that in here, you'll scare the little ones" the ex hero sighed and bunch of monster kids walked out of the church looking at the commotion."You.. are strong, i can feel you didn't fall yet, why? Wouldn't a man like you be happy enough in having all these girls for yourself?" She evaluated the warrior from head to toe getting a feel for his strength and personality."They follow me out of a desire to make me theirs, but this isn't my end, my objective wasn't reached yet my ideals wouldn't let me fall so easily even if life became harder now" the man spoke with conviction."The why won't you finish them, wouldn't life be easier if you stopped being attacked at every minute?" Sasha asked with a regretful tone for telling him to kill the monsters."Once upon a time i thought about finishing them, sometimes when it gets too hard i really consider the option" he looked back and the some girls were saddened, his sword in particular trembled because the girl inside was the only one he in a certain way finished."But finishing these girls means i'll be losing a precious rival, i only reached where i am now by being forged in the flames of perpetual conflict" the man enjoyed this journey."You playboy, lady killer, we love you too hubby~ you're a player you know that, teasing bastard!" they all mellowed out"So you are using them for self improvement of your body and mind..." the nun muttered."You aren't a hero of the order, they would consider such ways heretical, you never belonged to the order at all" Sasha said."Maybe if the order wasn't run by incompetents and bigots who refuse to improve their ways, my hometown wouldn't be overrun when i was a kid" the Warrior spoke with pure spite for the first time in this journey."So this was your reason, you want to find the Lilim that raided your place and defeat her for revenge?" Sasha concluded and the monsters that accompanied him since the beginning sighed."Fighting with revenge in mind will only make you fall in the end hubby""It's good at driving you to your goals, but it also can be weaponized back at you by her""You are strong but that won't be enough if you don't change your ways""HEY YOU BASTARD WHY YOU KEEP MAKING US WORRY FOR YOU LIKE THIS""After living with all of you my mind attained peace, i will not fight her for revenge anymore, only to improve myself even further my new objective is still the same but the reason changed, i want to prove the world i'm strong enough to defeat the monster who never was defeated" the warrior announced."So dreamy onii-chan~ but no can do, i can't let you do that, the Demon Lord is living happily with her hubby nowadays without a care for the world, i can't let you go and ruin her peace for such a selfish reason, so why don't you submit and become part of our coven Onii-chan~ all my sisters would love to play with you~" the Baphomet spoke before tackling him.With strength that was unthinkable for the little girl body she flew carrying the Warrior inside the forest, soon after his companions followed."What a strange party it was" the nun calmed down the kids and took them back inside.Flying through the forest"Nee Onii-chan don't you wanna touch my delicious petite body, neee~ pat me, hold me caress me~ nee~" she cooed to him still holding his body with a vice grip while charging through the forest."Sorry but the Ogre, Lizard man and Amazons are more of my type, their mature, toned and glistening bodies are a beautiful sight" he answered the loli, angering her."YES!" both looked at the distance and how excited both the Ogre and Lizardman were followed by the cheers of the amazons."Buuuu~ you meanie, what's cute about those muscular big sisters, i'll show you the body of a loli is the ultimate charming weapon!" the Baphomet pouted, even when angry she was charming and this began affecting him just like when he was dealing with the Demon."Calm down, focus your mind she's one of the strongest beings of the monster kind every action of hers is purposefully done to make you fall"The warrior attacked her with his cursed sword, his greatest weapon on dealing with high tier monsters, as their mana was so strong any normal weapon wouldn't even scratch them, this weapon that drank their mana with each slash at the cost of making the girl inside even stronger and passionate for him was his strongest option right now."(She tastes good man, give me more of her! I feel a sense of kinship with her mana!)" the Cursed sword demanded with excitement."Were you a Baphomet before?" the warrior asked without a answer."Ahnn~ you meanie!" the loli moaned feeling her power weaken and pleasure take hold of her with her grip loosening he escaped her embrace and took distance."It's me that should be making you moan, not the opposite!" she grabbed the floating scythe that accompanied them and swung it in a circle bellow her feet"Come to me nii-chan~" with a gesture of "go" she sent her spell at the warrior.The black magical circle released lots ot tentacles darker than night itself ooozing with the purest demon energy, danger signs popping all over his mind, the warrior did his best to dodge and cut the oncoming barrage, like a world of BLACK snakes soon enough they filled this area and all he could do was to keep slashing at it, making the sword even more crazed after drinking the spell."MORE MAN, GIVE VE MORE, CUT UP THAT LOLI AND LET ME DRINK HER MORE!" for the first time the voice of the blade was heard without the girl as it medium and it transformed into the demonic looking thing it once was."Ewww, that blade is disgusting nii-chan, where did you even get it?" the Baphomet could feel the blade was becoming more and more like a monster of old, why did it have this fascination with her?"This is the first time it happens, maybe it's one of your old friends?" he complied to his partner desires and attacked her, this sword became his shield and her strong magic attacks had no effect on it since it drank everything the girl threw at him."I don't know any Baphomet who was sealed in a sword though!" She evaded, with grace and the petite size of a loli body making it hard for the man to cut her up, but the dense forest surrounding them slowly became a clearing with him chopping down the trees as if they were butter."Time to feel the power of a Baphomet nii-chan~ try not to lose too fast ok?" She used her scythe as a weapon instead of a magic wand this time and clashed with the man.Soon enough his partners reached his battle grounds"Damn look at them go, i can't wait to ambush him once this is over~" the Werewolf sharpened her claws waiting her chance, while the orc got a new club from the fallen trees.The Baphomet jumped and punched her scythe making it spin like a sawblade at his direction, he side stepped it only for the scythe to come back like a boomerang, now the Baphomet was charging at him with empty hands while the scythe threatened to cut him from behind, he grabbed the loli with open arms much to her happiness, before throwing her at her own weapon, with a flip in the air she grabbed it and took a new stance while pouting at her nii-chan being a meanie again."He said i was his type, just you wait dude, i will pamper you so much love with these muscles you love, you won't ever drink water again because my sweat will be enough for you hee hee hee" the Ogre was in a good mood after hearing she was his type, so he looked at her like that heh, what a perv.The Baphometh jabbed her scythe in the ground and a dark fissure appeared behind the man with its blade ready to slash him, he stabbed his sword inside the fissure and it appeared from the hole bellow the girl cutting her and draining her mana once again breaking the displacement spell with a moan."Lovemaking after a hard fought battle, with our glistening sweaty bodies making lots of noise ahnnn~" the Lizard girl fantasized.The man tried to kick the girl but she stopped him with one hand, grabbing his leg she swung him around before throwing him like a ragdoll in the air before jumping after him, leaving a crater in the ground behind her, she tried to ram him with her horns, the man corrected his posture and dived into the girl for a slash, both passed by one another and he knelt down with a ragged breath, she got him this time, but not without paying the price, she came back down and a new slash appeared in her body, smoke rising from it making her mana escape from the wound and pleasure filling the space."Nii-chan please take me, i'm throbbing all over please caress me~""He truly is worth of being our chieftain, GO, GET HER MAN!" the amazons were in awe, he was fighting a Baphomet one of the strongest monsters, one of Druella's cherry picked generals and wasn't losing.The loli began stomping at the ground raising pillars of rock from it and then kicking them at high speeds against the man, who dodged some and cut those that couldn't be dodged, making a cloud of dirt in the process from the barrage, then with his vision obscured she once again opened a rift in space and swung her scythe inside, while also delivering punches and kicks focusing her senses on his spirit energy to target him, the man was doing his best to evade parry and strike back at her members each time a rift opened close to him, soon enough she began adding her spells to the mix making his life harder and harder."Why aren't you attacking him, didn't he say we could take our chances whenever no matter the situation?" the Kunoichi asked to the oldest members of his party."We reached a consensus to not interfere with his battles if its a new girl, after she joins us everything is fair game" the lizardman explained to the approval of the amazons, they wouldn't rob others of their chance to hunt."Doesn't it defeat the point?" still doubtful the kunoichi asked before hearing a Boom and turning back to his struggle.The warrior was more ragged than before but he got the girl, paying back the favor after honing his senses to find her presence outside, he threw a bunch of stones at high speed against the Baphomet from inside the dirt cloud, catching her by surprise since she didn't feel spirit energy from this attack, the loli winced with pain instead of pleasure her stamina decreasing in the process, the fruits of his training with the Valkyrie bore results, this made the girl lose her focus on her spells making them fail then exploding, both the dirty cloud the warrior was trapped within and herself with a pleasure shockwave, luckily the Cursed sword acted by itself and cut apart the resulting chain reaction, protecting his Holder from defeat."Yes, but look at him and say it doesn't make you horny as fuck watching his moves and struggle against a new opponent, look how beautiful he becomes when he's so close to defeat, his ragged breath, his body trembling, all his musky sweat from overexerting himself ahn~" they girls began masturbating to the fight leaving the Kunoichi alone in their reverie who now watched her new master and began feeling the same things."It seems nii-chan is a hit with the ladies, now they are pleasuring themselves looking at our battle~" the loli teased while also having difficulty to stand, she was one step from dropping down and masturbating as well, the damage slowly built up and her spell failure dealt immense recoil, she was one step from losing and becoming part of his harem."This was unexpected, but if it makes them happy i won't stop them" he glanced at the scene and how beautiful the girls were feeling his heartrate rise, before calming down and focusing back at the Baphomet in front of him."Onii-chan, i always searched for one like you, i promise, i wont bully you too much if i lose, but sometimes would you at least pamper me~" the loli pleaded with puppy eyes."I'll think about it" the warrior said, later he would regret this dearly, because this was literally a promise to her childlike mind."Now it's time to end this, either i win and you become mine or you win and i become yours~" the Baphomet felt reinvigorated by his promise."I don't want your body though""Too late nii-chan that was a promise, you'll will end up loving the charm of petite girls no matter what happens!"The little goat forgone her scythe in favor of her own body, she would beat her nii-chan to submission then ride him until he forgot any adult girl, of course she wouldn't steal him from the others, she was more than happy in making them become lolis themselves so everyone could enjoy their nii-chan."(this is your chance, one last cut and she will be depleted, be careful they are at their strongest when they are cornered, she will try to mount you and rape you, do not let her do it, do not even try to disarm her by caressing or hugging her, it wont work this time!)" the warrior nodded.The little girl charged at him trying to grip his members and pin him down, he wouldn't sidestep it because her reflexes would make her catch him and it would be the end, so he ran backwards while deflecting her strikes, the sword made her wary she didn't want to touch it because at this point it would drink from her without even needing to cut her.After many failures on pinning the warrior down, she became impatient and put her entire power in her legs and jumped at him, then she was cut, the sword cleaved her in half, with no means to dodge while airborne and too depleted of mana to cast a repositioning spell, she heard the sword laugh maniacally as it passed through her."AHNNNNNNN NIIIII-CHAAAAAAANNNN~" The Baphomet had the strongest orgasm ever as her demonic energy was completely sapped and replaced with pleasure then fell to the ground spasming and squirting."THIS IS IT, I REMEMBER WHO I WAS, I WAS THE HIGHEST BAPHOMET BEFORE BEING SEALED BY THE OLD DEMON LORD FOR THREATENING HIS RULE GYAHAHAHAHA THANKS MAN, DRINKING MY LITTLE SISTER HERE OPENED MY EYES, YOU WANT TO DEFEAT THE DEMON LORD RIGHT? LETS GO THEN, LETS DRINK HER AS WELL!" the sword was ecstatic to say the least while the other girls looked at it with wariness."Thanks my partner, i'm sure we have a chance now with you by my side" the Warrior spoke softly."Oh... c'mon man, you're making me blush in here you'll make the girlie jealous too, ow ow ow ow, stop it, we both are one and the same by now whatever i feel you feel it too ow" the Baphomet inside was being bullied by the girl it possessed, the wariness in the area dissipated and the girls began giggling, yup the cursed sword wasn't dangerous."Hubby~ you know what happens now don't you~" the werewolf appeared from the shadows and clawed at him missing her mark then walking seductively while emphasizing her toned body built from her life as a beast type."I heard your confession about me and the lizard being your type, why don't you come here and tell your big sister everythiiiing about it~" the Ogre said with a seductive tone he never heard before making him gulp."As she said my dear, let your big sisters care for all your needs~" the lizardman didn't help, this was becoming harder, it was a mistake confessing his tastes thinking only the Baphomet would hear it."I'm a little pudgy but i guarantee you that bellow this soft mellowness there's a nice fit body too~ don't you wanna touch if and feel it yourself~" the orc salivated while swinging her newest club."My ninja training molded my body in ways that could break you completely without losing my womanly charms, don't you wanna taste it master~" the Kunoichi readied herself already setting traps in the area."Now that we think about it, aren't we all your type? you've been making an harem filled with athletic girls haven't you perv~" The amazons chieftain spoke for her tribe and they cooed "come to your big sisters, and let us pamper you big boy~""(you dug your own grave man, next time keep your mouth shut, good luck because this will be a long night, ah before i forget, just a heads up for you, since i was sealed before the current monster lord changed us, i wasn't transformed into a loli like the girlie over there, neither i have any feelings about wanting to be one, so prepare your body and spirit, one day you'll see a true Baphomet big sister and i feel i'm totally your type~ more so than the Ogre nee-san there, be careful to not fall for my wiles instantly once i come out~ hehehehehe)" the sword put the last nail on the coffin, this night would be one of his hardest ones yet."Buuu~ go nii-chan, don't lose to these meanies i will make you love the petiteness of a loli!" the Baphomet now awaken from her reverie cheered on for the warrior, she disliked all these adults wanting to take him away just them wait, she would turn them all into little girls soon enough."Well my beautiful Onee-sans, come and get your nii-chan then!" The warrior smiled before rushing at the girls and starting a new battle for survival.

    After a fighting everyone once again and making sure he KO'ed them down, then making a very happy and proud Baphomet for defeating all the adults promise she wouldn't attack him during his sleep, after paying her with head pats and hugs like she wanted to, the warrior finally had a moment of rest and found himself once again in the dreamscape facing the Valkyrie."Why do you make this so hard for yourself? Why won't you end them? I know using them as a stepping stone for your eventual meeting with the Lilim and the Demon Lord is part of your plan, but can't you see the demonic energy slowly creeping inside of you? Soon enough you will explode and fail... Please my champion stop acquiring more followers, the Baphomet is dangerous enough already, if you get a new one at the same level you'll surely will fall she could be convinced thanks to her nature but i doubt you can do the same to the next one" the Valkyrie was worried about her champion, and began thinking it was time to meet him in the real world to protect him from the others."I'm grateful for you worrying about me, i truly am Valkyrie, but if i don't take this risk then what chances i even have of reaching the Demon Lord? She who is so strong that just by being around her city could turn a woman into a monster and break the mind of a man into a crazed sex maniac thanks to the energy she releases, imagine then what would be like to stand in her presence and taking the full brunt of that?" the Warrior knew this was a madman's journey and was grateful for the battle maiden worries but his actions had very rational thoughts behind them."So it's because of that, i didn't think that far, still it's a risky gamble my champion i've lost many of my sisters to corruption, i didn't want to lose you too... Sorry" the Valkyrie was saddened she didn't understand her champion fully yet."No insults taken" The Warrior comforted the woman making her mood slightly better."Now Valkyrie, lets train, to one day hopefully defeat them i felt great after battling you last week" the Man readied himself, he couldn't forget how good he felt after the first time they trained together it felt like weeks of constant battle but when he woke up he felt stronger than ever before."When you are in this dreamscape you're actually closer to heaven, the flow of time in here is different and the best part is that monsters can't feel anything wrong with you while it happens" she smiled she took a stance."The first duel, START!" they advanced at one another.Weeks later"Thank you Valkyrie" the warrior bowed while the woman shone with light and recovered fully"You don't need to thank me, this is my mission after all..." she spoke as a matter of fact."I'm still grateful, for you to keep up with my insane requests during the last week, training with you fills me with confidence in my goals" the warrior thanked her once again."Y-you don't need to be so sincere you know" the battle maiden blushed."Will we meet again?""For sure we will my champion as many times as you want" she smiled before adding"I think it's time for a new blessing, this time i'll bless your soul, the corruption you'll face will only be greater from now on and while the cursed Sword you use can snap you out of mind tricks and charms, i'll add another layer of protection in case that ever fails" the Valkyrie kissed the warrior and he felt warmth all over."Time to wake up, remember i'll always be with you my champion" the maiden said with a smile before the world disappeared.Back at reality"Onii-chan good morning!"The first thing that happened when he woke up was being jumped by the Baphomet who began seducing him, now that he was awake everything was fair game and he didn't have his sword"Nee nii-chan, i'm so hungry, i could you give me some milk pretty please~" the girl used her charm to seduce him, then frowned as the man wasn't forcing himself inside her yet."Sorry, but i don't think there's a cow around these parts" The blessing was in effect, he still felt some throbbing from her advances but it was nowhere near close to what he would if he didn't have this new protection."Now be a good girl and get up from me" the warrior patted and caressed the girl's head, who melted from the caress, giving him enough room to escape and find his sword."Ahhh you meanie" the Baphomet was angry once again but the man was prepared for it, the sword was excited for breakfast as well and changed into its demonic form instantly."Time to drink my partner! Now go and get me that sweet morsel! GYAHAAHAHA!""OUUU" the man with partner in hands charged at his prey...."Meanie! meanie! meanie!" after a long battle, even with the others helping her with potshots, stealth attacks, blindside strikes using the her rift spell and savagery of the strong, once again the girl was panting in the ground after coming all over and making a mess after being bisected by the sword who was laughing at her tantrum."GYAHAHAHAH Sorry girlie but the one with more chances in bonding with my partner is me and my girlie! our connection is something you'll never reach GYAHAHAHA" The sword taunted, in some ways it was true, since it inhabited his old sword that has been with him for most of his life the cursed sword knew more about his struggles and desires than anyone else."Thanks for the food~" it teased too much and now the Baphomet teared with anger."Ahhh mooo i'm out of here! just you wait nii-chan one day i'll make you forget all about that old crone there" she opened a portal and was ready to leave."Were are you going?" the man asked curious, this would be the first girl who would leave."I'm still a general for the princess, of course i'll go back to her and keep doing my job, we're still bound by our agreement after all since meanie Nii-chan refuses to bind me to him" the girl pouted."Oh" the man answered."Awww is Nii-chan regretful, will Nii-chan miss me, don't worry i'll always come back for you, you have my word~" the Baphomet laughed and disappeared inside the dark gate.At the monster camp"So you were defeated" Druella spoke"Yes, Nii-chan is so dreamy, finally a human who can defeat a Baphomet appeared kyaa~" the loli was excited."Indeed, his value keeps rising each day" she said with a deadpan tone"ahnn i want to meet him so much! but i need to save that town first, and give a husband to all my girls, and convert the heroines! ahh so much to do and now this man is teasing me by being so close, oh dear me~" the Lilim was a timebomb ready to explode at any moment right now."I also found out the origins of his cursed sword, it's a High Baphomet sealed before the times before your mommy" the girl said with a tinge of anger."Tell me more" the Lilim was curious and wary, if the sword was from before her mom's time wouldn't it mean there was a risk of him becoming a bloodthirsty murderer?"SHE'S A MEANIE A MEANIE I TELL YOU" the loli defused her doubts."She keeps breaking my charms on him, she keeps drinking my mana, and keeps humiliating me in front of everyone by making me cum silly ahh meeh meeh meehhh" the Baphomet threw a tantrum and made cute goat noises."Oh you poor little girl, she really is a meanie" The Lilim giggled at the scene, well he wouldn't be reduced to a mindless murderer, good, no need to employ the mindflayers then."Right? meeehhh... meeeehhh" she kept stomping around."And why you came back instead of staying with him like the others? Different from the Demon you don't need a contract, and if you wanted you could even turn them all into little girls to your sabbath and attack him" she asked with curiosity on why didn't she lose her general."Because i still have an agreement with you princess nee-chan" the girl calmed down and answered."If he took me for himself i could stay with him in our little sabbath of love, sadly he refused..." she teared up."Onii-chan is such a meanie, but i can't help not to love him now that he defeated me 2 times, so i promised i would come back to him often during my free time" she said with a voice full of desire for their next "dates""Go get him girl~" the Lilim encouraged"Yes nee-chan!" the girl raised her hand with a smile."All our plans are set, after this night i'm personally coming for you my dear~" Lescatie's fate was sealed and soon she would get her own husband, she only hoped he was everything he was hyped up to be.Back with the warriorEnacting his plan on thinning her forces the warrior employed guerrilla tactics, and would bait out any patrolling straggler into traps he made beforehand"This isn't a challenge at all, say can't i just go there and fight everyone at once?" he asked the Kunoichi he just defeated"It's your own grave master" she warned him while panting her masochism satisfied once again."Hmm" he walked away while searching new targets.The warrior fought a band of orcs being led by a high one who thought it was strange that the others weren't coming back, it was nostalgic making him remember of his beginnings and how long he came to reach this point this was the first time he fought a High Orc and her smell made his own go into a frenzy attacking him together with them, after a relatively hard battle vs the High Orc, her speed and power fulfilling his cravings the man rose up as the victor making the woman and her band submit, eventually calming down his own Orc who surprisingly was the last to fall down, it seemed she was one step from evolving into a High Orc herself."feeling nostalgic hubby~" the Orc said seductively"In a sense, yes" he said as he denied their advances and explained his reason leaving them, much to their sadness.Sometime laterHe fought a werewolf pack led by a Hellhound his nostalgia intensifying, these wolves weren't even close to hitting him like, they felt slower than his Werewolf and soon were beaten into wanting him as their alpha, except the Hellhound, she seemed like she wouldn't ever admit defeat until she broke him, her reason being that humans are weak and should submit to the strong, he liked her attitude and indulged on her, beating her over and over again while fending the others, eventually he forced the battered wolf to sit and give paw, the unthinkable happened a Hellhound was tamed something that even the gods failed at doing, she was forced to admit after being beaten so many times by this man while he fended off his own entourage that he had potential to be a strong mate, she wanted to show him off to the others, this made her lust ablaze like the fiery depths and now she would try to rape him over and over, with her stamina fully recovered and being helped by his Werewolf who also wouldn't admit defeat, the battle continued for another hour before they lost again."It's because of you i got strong, i wish i could form a pack with you already hubby~ our children would reach the very top of our species~""Hmmm" after refusing being their alpha and telling the hellhound she was free to try again in the future he left, the wolves howled with tears and the hellhound with indignation after their alpha left them.Sometime laterThis time he fought a battalion of lizardmen led by a salamander, his own lizardman joining the fray, finally he would fulfill his wish of fighting one he thought to himself.Their coordination as warriors made him struggle more than the ones before, they didn't fight with just power, instinct or overwhelming savagery, they used all of it while remaining composed and situation aware, he had to keep his footwork while they became more and more aroused with the thirst for battle, the Salamander being the worst since the longer this battle took greater her flames became, he now was under a time limit, soon the flames would be too much and all the sweating would sap his stamina until he lost, this made his own battle craze aflame and after a prolonged fight heat be damned, he finally took the upper hand and defeated the warriors."DUDE THIS WAS LIKE THE BEST BATTLE EVER MAN!" The Salamander was all giddy, right now she was a fiery inferno and he couldn't make much of her features hidden by her flames, she was red and he couldn't decide if it was from the heat or from wanting to fuck him, probably the latter, yup totally sure it was the later.The girls dropped their weapons and began undressing wanting him to take them as his, which he refused on the spot making them complain about it, soon enough the lizardman would lead her own battalion."The lizardmen's training is lacking, i was stronger than that when i fought you, should i train them myself?" his Lizardman spoke already making plans for the other girls."If you want to" he quickly left, much to the complaints of the girls, except the salamander who vowed she would seek him to the ends of the world."Just you wait dude, soon enough you'll fall to my flames~" for now she also would learn the skills of his lizardman companion and even give the girl some pointers of her own."You still think you want to fight them all by yourself?" the kunoichi appeared trying to "assassinate" him but failing once again."No, the last battles taught me well, if i end up surrounded by a group of Salamanders my end would be swift" he answered knowing she was evaluating him."I'm proud of you master" the kunoichi disappeared leaving the warrior to his own devices."Time to hunt some more" the man left.Sometime laterThe man found himself facing a lone Manticore, who smiled at him with a sadistic grin while opening her fleshy tail and threatened to gobble him up with it expecting a look of terror in his face she got angry when he calmly challenged her instead, then smiled again thinking how she would enjoy breaking him completely to her wills once she filled his body with her poison."So you're a hero diving down into this forest to defeat the scary monster girls aren't you, I'll enjoy breaking you" the girl spoke."I do not consider myself a hero, but yes i'm here to defeat most of you" the warrior took a stance, he read about this one and knew the high velocity spikes she could launch from her tail were her greatest weapon.The manticore laughed and as expected with a whip of her tail launched her barbs at him, only one hit was needed for her victory and put the human on his place under her, with a silly face being milked.The warrior deflected the barrage, his senses honed to the max after everything he lived through it was easy for him to do so when he constantly had to dodge invisible attacks from the Kunoichi and the increasingly stealthy Werewolf, he dodged deflected and slashed and soon enough the entire floor was filled with harmless tail spikes."What the fuck?!" the Manticore wasn't believing what she saw and soon she was being attacked and being forced in a defensive position, her spikes would grow again in some minutes but some minutes was all the time the warrior needed."If you think i only have my spikes you are so wrong asshole" the angered Manticore fought back with swipes from her huge clawed paws, whipping her tail like a flail."I never underestimated you Manticore" the warrior parried her swipes dodged her whip like tail then slashed at her, he wouldn't dare touch her tail even without its barbs, he didn't know how long it took for them to recover and wouldn't accept a joke loss of trying to hold it only to be punctured by a spike that just grew out."Be more proud of your strength as a demon beast instead of seeking the easy way out with your tail" the man said much to her anger, making her look like a lazy bum for using her most know feature."That's it asshole you're going down!" the girl got on all fours and stabbed her tail like a spear against his crotch and kept doing so while also pouncing using her claws to cut his escape routes, she even used her wings as a weapon, if anyone watched her right now they would think she was a monster from before the current Demon Lord era."That's the spirit" he said as he made his cursed sword grow to its demonic form, the increased surface area would act as a shield when she blasted her spikes at him again, and as soon as he did it she did as expected and got angrier for failing once again.sometime later she was tired from the effort, growing back her spikes costed her energy to do so, a small amount but it eventually snowballed, the floor of their arena was full of them by now, some stragglers caught in the crossfire were masturbating their minds out from the aphrodisiac venom and calling her asking for more, her target thought had none on his body and this angered her more than ever, she wanted to drink him but he had to make life harder for the girl didn't he?"Asshole" she insulted him before pouncing at him again and he finally cut her down, now she was the one cumming silly together with everyone else."That was a good battle" the warrior left while she called him every insult know to man while orgasming until she passed out thanks to the cursed sword effects.At nightAfter spending the entire day thinning the monster invasion forces, the Warrior sat down and rested his bones, no one wanted to attack him as they were tired as well, even monsters need rest, and with him refusing to feed them his spirit energy their own energy was depleted."With this Lescatie should have a fighting chance won't it?" he asked the Kunoichi"Yes master, their chances rose from absolutely impossible to almost impossible""Even after spending the entire day fighting?" the warrior was crestfallen, he by himself repelled hundreds of monsters of many kinds and using his partner depleted them enough that they shouldn't be a problem and it still wasn't enough?"Even though master fought some really high tier monsters and defeated them all magnificently, Druella is still there, all of us are nothing more than cannon fodder in her plans" The kunoichi answered with a sincere tone, the Lilim by herself was more than enough to topple Lescatie, the monsters following her only wanted to partake in the chaos and find a husband once she did her magic opening the way for them."The Lilim really is at a higher level..." He poked at the flames with a stick."Nii-chan~" a excited little girl he knew appeared from the void before them."I've heard about Nii-chan feats today, I'm so proud of you~ My nii-chan is the strongest of all~" she excitedly said before jumping at the man, without thirst in her voice or actions he just let the little girl sit close to him and patted her earning a "mehh" sound from the girl."So what are you doing here, you came to battle me once again, the promise was that i would play with you and then you would let me rest for the night" the warrior asked and the girl pouted."Buuhhhh~ meanie Nii-chan, but that's also why i love you~" after being petted enough the girl rose up and walked away from him."No, i came here to tell you this is the night Lescatie will fall, and that the princess is very interested in you after you defeated almost the entirety of her forces by yourself, Nii-chan is so dreamy~ kya~" the little girl was proud of the Warrior, he kept himself chaste once again and didn't let anyone take him, in her mind her Nii-chan was saving himself for her."She said that you should sleep early, because once she finishes her job she'll come for you and expects a good fight~" with this she disappeared into the gate, but left it open, maybe to bring him into a trap? after telling the man the city would fall he remembered his childhood and unknowingly began moving to the portal."Master, please follow her advice and rest, you strained yourself too much, you aren't in any shape to challenge her" the Kunoichi spoke, and the other girls also tried to convince him.The warrior was one step from the portal, it beckoned him like a devil whispering temptations to his mind promising his objective would finally be achieved, he didn't know if Druella was the one responsible for what happened to his town and his friend becoming a nymphomaniac succubus, but he was more than willing to try."(Listen to them my partner, i can feel your hesitation and how torn you are between fighting her now or later, but i can tell you this, you will fail and lose horribly if you step inside as you are now)" the worried cursed sword spoke."I'll take your advice then..." the warrior took a step back and turned to the crowd, the portal as if angry for him not taking the bait disappeared instantly."Girls... tomorrow maybe i'll fight my last battle as a human, so i ask of you, do not try and attack me during this night, do not try to help the Lilim during our fight, just stay around and cheer for the man you came to love for various reasons after he defeated you" the warrior asked."Oi you ass! don't make this speech as if you are expecting to lose, act like the man who beat the crap out of us so many times and say you will pound the princess to the ground!" the Ogre answered with a slap to his back."If you say things like that hubby, chances are we wont let you fight her because we all will rape you right now~" the newly evolved High Orc spoke."Show her the power that could tame even a hellhound!" the proud Werewolf added."Show her the true might of a warrior my dear" the lizardman said while her batallion and a really fiery Salamander nodding."Yeah chieftain! go and make your tribe proud!" the amazons roared."(Tomorrow is the day my partner, let us drink all of her, and the power of a Lilim will be yours, you won't need to fear the Demon Lord's aura anymore)" the sword spoke to him."Thanks, then let me rephrase myself, this night you all better let me rest fully for my fight tomorrow and not interfere, either i won't forgive any of you and this time UTTERLY BEAT YOUR CRAP INTO TO THE GROUND!" The warrior laughed to the cheers of all the girls."A masterful speech my lord this humble kunoichi will make sure none will bother you during your rest" the ninja kneeled down before disappearing, she would set traps all around so the wild monsters of the invasion force wouldn't try to ambush them during this night."You heard the ninja girls, this night we shall protect our hubby's rest, go and defeat any newcomer trying to take a bite out of him!" the High orc spoke to the agreement of everyone and they left, now the warrior was alone with his sword one rare moment of peace at night without any fighting."What are my chances of defeating her?" the man asked."(Dude considering she's a Lilim, your chances are very small even with my help)" the sword spoke the hard truth."It will be a hard one isn't it"."(Totally)"."Thanks for all the help until now"."(I should be one thanking you partner, if it wasn't for your craziness i would never remember who i am)"."A High Baphomet from before the current era, how it was during your times?"."(Lot's of bloodshed, tears, strife and wars, i remember we used to rear humans as cattle to fuel our spells with their suffering)"."The current era, isn't as bad then" the man reflected on all that happened."(Yup, the current era is having it too easy if i say so)" the sword said with a tinge of sarcasm."If i defeat the Lilim and reach the Demon Lord i'll force her to have a piece of my mind" the warrior promised."(I bet that would be amusing as hell)" the sword laughed."Time to rest, good night partner, and girl""(good night my beloved)".Dreamscape"This is the last time we train together my champion, your goal is at hand" the Valkyrie welcomed him with a tone colder than before before readying herself."Since this time you got a full night of rest, prepare yourself because we'll have the equivalent of 1 month in here to train you, and with the permission of the Chief God i got some help" the battle maiden said and a flock of angels armed with a bunch of different weapons appeared."Please guide my way Valkyrie" the warrior accepted and soon he would be fighting like never before.One month laterThe warrior was in a sorry state, battered all over and sprawled in the ground, an entire month without rest battling the angels strained his ethereal form so much sometimes the world flashed as if he would be awakened, but he held on and fought with spirit and tenacity that eventually made the angels praise him, the Valkyrie especially mellowed more and more to the warrior with time."It's been one month, Valkyrie, thank you for guiding me until now" the Warrior said as he rose up to his feet and watched the battered angels flash with light and reform themselves as if nothing happened."It was my pleasure my champion, i'm forever grateful to the Chief God for having been assigned to you" the maiden hugged the warrior and kissed him, filling him with warmth and for some reason he reciprocated the kiss much to the battle maiden and the angels shock."My champion..." feeling his warmth she wanted more, but soon separated herself from the man."As reward for your efforts, this is the new blessing you get, come here all of you" the Valkyrie called the angels and they made a circle with the man and the battle maiden at the center then began chanting some incomprehensible language."The last blessing was upon your soul, to defend you against the charm of the monsters, this blessing will weaponize your spirit itself so you can use the Holy element, the only thing that can truly damage a mamono of the Demon Lord family" the Maiden spoke feeling the energy of the angels entering her and she as a medium injecting his spirit with the blessing.The warrior felt a rush of power like never before, his spirit rose to heights he didn't think were possible, so much he began feeling pain from it, ascending to something more a hero, he was grateful for the blessings of his Valkyrie and the Chief God for helping his journey, soon enough the ritual was complete and he felt like light like feather and hotter than the salamander flames."Thank you for this boon Valkyrie, with this i'm more confident in beating the Lilim""This was everything i could do for you my champion, please... don't lose..." the maiden hugged the warrior once again and a single tear of worry formed"I won't, watch me from the heavens, i will make the Lilim my stepping stone to even greater heights!" the man comforted the maiden and the scenario around them began flashing with light."It's time to wake up" he said."My champion, this blessing of holy power won't work with the cursed sword you are holding for it will damage it as well, so use it as a last resort once the sword drinks the Lilim mana and weakens her!" the Valkyrie spoke as she disappeared in motes of light together with the angels."Noted".Reality During his sleepThe girls after defeating all the monsters that tried to taste their man and sending them back to the invasion currently happening came back to their hubby and watched in awe, his spirit evolved more and more in front of their very eyes and they almost lost control to their monster instincts screaming at them to rape him and taste it, but with lots of effort they controlled it their love and loyalty for the warrior surpassing the desire to take his helpless visage as theirs."I believe hubby has more than enough of a chance to defeat her now""Heck i wanna see this bastard putting her on his lap and spank her butt like the spoiled brat she is HAHAHAH""Master, so this is why you asked us to not bother you, even during your sleep you find a way to fight and get stronger""We were right in following you chieftain, you really are the greatest hunt ohh we can only imagine the taste of your game""I'll be praying for your victory my dear, show her your strength and awe us once again with a great battle"That night none of the girls slept tired as they were because they just wanted to burn forever into their minds this human that changed their lives.Ending note: final chapter next time hopefully, d'aww these rape monsters are like maidens in love
  
    Chapter Text
    The next morningThe warrior woke up with a sense of foreboding, all around him there was this pink aura that felt like muck against his body."So Lescatie has fallen overnight and now i'm inside a newly made Demon Realm" the man trembled with anger before calming down and looking at his surroundings, his companions were looking at him with eyes filled with lust and awe but didn't move to attack, he felt his own body and noticed how strong he became, he felt confident for his next battle."Good morning hubby dearest~ did you have nice dreams?" one of the girls asked."Yes, the friend in my dreams trained me for a long time" he answered."So that's how your spirit evolved, i feel jealous hmph, promise me you won't leave us behind even if you get stronger than the Lilim" the Lizardman spoke"Of course i won't, you too are growing and with the advantage of numbers and coordination by your side, you'll always pose a challenge my dear rivals""Heheh you can bet your ass we will be~" the girls laughed."(I feel you have a disgusting new power my friend, it will be a boon for your next fight but try not to use it while holding me will ya?)" the Cursed sword spoke to his mind after feeling the changes on his soul."I wouldn't damage you like that my partner" the man calmed the sword down"I have a plan, can you convince the girl in following it or could you take the reins when the time comes?" the warrior spoke in private and told the sword his plan."(Ohoo, so its like that, we can do it, after learning from your fights be assured that we can support you when it's time to use your new power)" the sword trembled with excitement, this would be the first in a long time it could fight by itself instead of being held by its partner, it couldn't wait to bathe itself on the Lilim's power."Let's go, time to meet the fourth borne" the man said to the cheers of everyone."Onii-chan~ the princess is summoning your presence" As if on cue a portal appeared and the Baphomet came through it."Before i go, tell me, did they fight to the end or the heroes fell like flies?""Awww onii-chan is regretful of not coming last night" the Baphomet teased before answering"They put up a good fight, but it wasn't enough, different from you who kept your calm and willpower even after being bombarded with our charms, they were too straight laced and filled with doubts thanks to their shackles... It was so pitiful and sad seeing them like that" The Baphomet remembered about her new daughter, and how she forced herself to act like an adult thanks to the impossible requests of everyone around her and her own power."It was easy for us to convince them to our cause after finding the reason they were like that~" the girl smiled as if she just did the greatest charity deed of her life."The dear sister nee-chan also repented herself and became a beautiful dark priestess, now she's living happily with her children raping the man she loves" the way she spoke it made the man angry and she cowered from his gaze."So you corrupted young human kids into your debauchery is what you're telling me" the warrior said with a cold voice looking down at the girl."Nii-chan you are scary... don't look at me like that please...""You need punishment, prepare yourself" with speed and power she didn't expect from him, the warrior grabbed the girl and put her on his lap, infusing holy power into his hand he began spanking her."Stop nii-chan, it hurts, it huuuuurts, meeeeh meeeehhh" the cries of the little Baphomet were heard all over."You know why i'm doing this to you?" the man said with rage."Noo you meanie you won't say anything how should i know meeeeehh" the Baphomet kept crying."You just did to them what happened to me during my own childhood, you just corrupted young humans into nymphomaniac monsters without a care, let me tell you something you loli bitch, different from monster children, we humans are slow in our development, the most important thing for a healthy childhood is love and care from our relatives and friends, and before you tell me it's the same thing, the love i speak about is not the thing you monsters call love!" he spanked the girl more."You just took their innocent days away from them!" he kept spanking the Baphomet and she kept crying, some of the girls stepped forward to stop him because it was becoming too much, but when the man turned his gaze full of hate to them, they stopped."Of course i'm preaching to the choir, you Baphomets are a species whose main goal is to corrupt children and make pedos out of grow men, nothing i can say can ever change your own nature as a monster, but this won't stop me from delivering punishment if you tell to my face you just corrupted a bunch of them while donning that sickening smile" the man gave one last slap, the Baphomet buttocks by now was redder than a Salamander in heat and the girl wouldn't stop crying."Meanie! meeeh... meehhh... I hate you nii-chan, i hate youuuuu! meeeh" the girl disappeared with her heart utterly broken."Man, what you did was too much...""I won't ask forgiveness for it, what i said was the truth" the man rose up and began walking to the portal."Even so... argghhh... just go and defeat the Lilim, then give the Demon Lord a piece of your mind dammit!"The warrior disappeared and all the awe they felt was replaced by silence, it seems his trauma was stronger than they thought, one by one they walked inside the portal still open, it seems the spoiled princess wanted to make a show of him.Lescatie Throne roomThe man stepped out and felt immediately sick, the Demonic aura was strong in here, looking around he saw a bunch of strong looking monsters and noticed one of them looked like Sasha and together with 2 little girls was lost in ecstasy raping a young man who by now was completely unresponsive, putting the puzzle pieces together the warrior guessed the others most probably were the other heroes who fell to corruption, so was this man like him? did he steal these girls hearts with his strength and fell once the tables were turned?"Welcome warrior~" the warrior turned to the source of the voice and saw a haughty woman looking at him from the throne, evaluating the man with her gaze like a gourmet evaluates food before tasting it."Lilim" the man clenched his sword handle"I heard many great things from you warrior, how you defeated most of my forces single handedly, how you took part of them for yourself to train with, the fact you took down a Baphomet 2 times and one of those was while being attacked from all the others that accompanied you, how you did the feat not even the gods thought it was possible and beat a Hellhound into submission, about your reflexes being able to stop a manticore rain of spikes for hours without letting even one pierce your beautiful skin..." the Lilim kept talking about everything reported to her as if reading a list."I decided you are worthy of being my husband, so come to me my beautiful warrior and take the prize you searched for so long" Druella seduced the man and put her strongest charm in her voice."Before that, answer me, was it you who raided a certain village about 30 years ago" the warrior told her about his childhood expecting a positive answer from the girl, expecting that this was the same Lilim that turned his life hell for the last 3 decades."Ohooo it seems our fates are bound even tighter than i thought~ so you were that boy and had me in your mind for the last 30 years, ahnnn you lady killer~" The Lilim never expected the boy she left alone as a caprice would grow up to be this hunk in front of him and above all else he did everything he did just to meet her again."Oh man, it seems we'll lose our chance with hubby, now she's motivated""DAMMIT!""Hubby don't lose please""How dreamy, he's the same as us and finally met his beloved after waiting for so long" The fallen heroines commented, stopping her sex frenzy with the man and looking at the newcomer."We should prepare a big party once they share their vows" the Roper spoke"With the blessing of the Fallen God may they live forever in bliss" The Dark priest added"Fight me Lilim, i'll make you pay for ruining my life, for taking my dear friend away from me, and above all to prove myself a human can still defeat the Demon Lord and her daughters even in this era!" the Man pointed his sword at Druella."You're becoming dreamier by the minute hubby. i can't wait to show you to mommy after we marry~" still with a smile of superiority the woman rose from her throne and descended to be at his level."None of you shall interfere, he's mine!" the princess raised her hand and a Barrier of dark energy surrounded the place, kicking everyone out to the sides"Let us begin hubby, try to make this a challenge will you~""I say the same to you!"The woman raised her hand and a bunch of dark orbs materialized around her, then with a snap of her fingers they flew at the warrior who cut them down and strengthened his sword in the process."The cursed sword i heard about, she's also a monster and using her should be considered cheating, but she's also part of you at this point, okay you can use her, after all no normal weapon could ever hope to hit me aahahahaha" the woman laughed and pulled her own sword to fight him at his level for now.The Lilim lunged with her rapier targeting his heart, the warrior was surprised for a moment, her speed was so great it felt like teleporting but it was for just a moment, the man sidestepped her lunge and punched her in the gut as payback, making her wince with pain before stepping back, the warrior then began feeling warmth creeping from his hand, it seems fist fighting will be risky."Did you like the feel of it hubby~ no matter where you touch me my entire body has the power to make you mine~ why don't you drop you weapon and indulge on me, you know you desire it~" Druella taunted, his willpower would only last for so long before he used his other sword to stab her and she got wet from imagining it."It seems what the encyclopedia told about you wasn't exaggeration" the warrior took a step back and analyzed her."Ohh so you've read it, tell me didn't it stroke the fire in your delicious loins? Did you know that when the schoolar came to visit us to write about it, we casted a spell on the book to slowly charm any man who read it into becoming more open to the embrace of monsters~" the Lilim said something that the warrior wasn't expecting, so that's why he didn't kill his partners when he had the chance and why he unknowingly made an harem of fit girls even they weren't his type originally."Well i have to thank you for it then, had i killed them instead of sparing them and battling constantly to not be raped during my journey, i wouldn't be where i am now, i would be nothing more than a mindless sex addict" The warrior said amusing the Lilim."And now what do you think will happen to you once you meet the one you were most interested in that book? Our species doesn't even need spells to charm men, the more you are in my presence the faster you'll be falling for me~" The Lilim said before attacking him again trying to clash with his sword and let her smell waft into his nose as another part of her charm, the man kicked her away and felt his leg throbbing now."Sorry, but even if you say that you aren't my type, you are too feminine for my tastes, as i said before to the Baphomet, Athletic and strong looking girls like the Ogre, Lizardman, Salamander, Amazon, Werewolf, Orc and Kunoichi are more of my type~" The warrior said with a flirting tone much to the cheers of everyone watching them."GO HUBBY, CHIEFTAIN, ASSHOLE, DEAREST RIVAL, MASTER~" Everyone cheered"Ahhh what a beautiful declaration of Love, go Warrior, defeat the princess and make your beloved ones happy~" the fallen heroines added to the cheers"DONT FORGET ABOUT ME!" The sword angrily complained."So even if i fall, you won't be the one i will be searching to quench my desires" he said calming down his throbbing heart, breaking her charm."So it's like that then... Let me tell you something about us Lilims my dear~ The feminine looking girl that was smaller than him began growing while donning a dangerous smile"Ou species can change our form to best fit the desires of the man that catches our interest, now matter what monster you want i can become it~" her form becoming as fit as a minotaur without losing any of her more supple feminine aspects, soon enough she towered him by 3 heads."My little boy wants a girl that can bend him over and break his bones into powder right~ then come to your mommy~" the fully transformed Lilim forgone her sword and delivered a devastating punch at the man."YOU AND YOUR DAMN MOUTH WHY DID YOU SPILL THE BEANS, NOW SHE GOT THE ADVANTAGE AGAIN!" The sword raged slashing at the Lilim making only a nick at her skin before being blown away, fucking great, she needed a death by thousand cuts now."Shit!" The man evaded the thing coming at him and the shockwave from the punch created a crack in her barrier."Ara~ no can do, now be a good boy and stay still for mommy~" The Lilim laughed, by the end of this day all his bones would be the purest adamantite after breaking them into powder over and over with the best femdom sex he could ever imagine."Sorry but i still remember you old form, don't think i can fall for temptation so easily!" strengthening his body with the Valkyrie holy blessing he did his best to parry her and fight back, the Holy element was dealing very low damage to her since she was at full power still, but at least it protected him from her demonic aura his firsts and legs didn't throb as much from making contact with the girl when countering her."You even have the blessings of a Valkyrie i see, i want to make you mine even more now!"Punch, kick, dodge, grab, pin, break the stance, feint, jump, rollThe duo's fight was making craters all over the throne room which were immediately fixed as if time rewound itself, Druella not only maintaned the barrier but also their arena, she wouldn't accept victory from her future husband tripping over some rubble, the man was grateful for that, the more she wasted her energy doing things like these the more chances he had, soon enough the sword which was blown away joined the battle.chink chink chink chink SLASHMan half moons of reddish dark energy materialized surrounding the Lilim and cutting her all over, noticing the danger to himself the warrior disengaged from the battle and stepped away from the bombardment."HEY YOU BITCH, DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME, DON'T EVEN THINK I WILL LET YOU STEAL HIM AWAY!" the once unfeeling girl spoke with anger while holding the cursed sword which was more demonic looking than ever now, filled with eyes all over and pulsating with a unholy mix of veins and steel, the girl herself was changed no longer looking like a human she had the features of a Baphomet if they ever became adult and towered above both of them.SLASH drip drip drip SPLASHAnother space tearing cut was made and droplets of red liquid rained upon the Lilim who was being seriously damaged by the attack."You're beautiful" the Warrior was in awe"Hehehe, don't make me wanna rape you now my partner, let us first defeat the girlie over there" the Baphomet blade smiled at him with beautiful tomboyish smile that almost melted his heart."You're strong, what kind of monster are you?" the Lilim reappeared back at her small feminine form with lots of pink smoke rising from her cuts."GYAHAHA, This magnificent me was the strongest Baphomet of his era, so strong in fact the Demon Lord feared me to the point he together with his strongest aides sealed me away to rot inside the sword, they all still paid a great price for it thought Kufuhehehe" this revelation shocked everyone in this place, except Druella who had stars glittering in her eyes."So you are him, the one even mommy once feared, thank you, if it wasn't for you daddy and mommy wouldn't be able to defeat the Old Demon Lord" The Lilim bowed to the strong conqueror before her."YEAH, IT'S TIME I VISIT THEM TO RECEIVE TRIBUTE GYAHAHAHA" The Baphomet was ecstatic to say the least, so it was the one responsible for the current state of the world? its old desire of absolute chaos was sated in a way."But i won't let you bother mommy peaceful honeymoon" the air changed around Druella again."Prepare yourselves this time i'll be fighting for real" the world trembled and soon a giant portal opened whisking the three away from the area worrying everyone."THAT BITCH KIDNAPED HUBBY!""WHERE DID THEY GO""DAMMIT YOU BETTER DEFEAT HER YOU HEAR ME!""Ara~ the princess is taking this seriously now, i hope that dreamy man can defeat her, she always wanted a husband stronger than her after all~""Let us pray so the Fallen God may bless them"The realm of the LilimLooking around at this place that looked as beautiful as the night sky the warrior felt some of his energy being sapped away."Welcome to our final lovemaking place my dear, i will never let you go~" the Lilim said before bombarding him with spells that could topple a entire castle down"Oh no you wont!" the sealed baphomet released her everything now that she could let it loose, destroying the spell."As expected from you, but your size will be your downfall" the small woman became a white flash and slashed away at the Baphomet who had troubles in dealing with her."Stop and let me hit you already! Hey partner help me!" she tried to no avail hitting the girl, even her area of effect spells like the rain and fissures didn't hit the woman."On it!" the warrior said raising his hand and calling the blade to him, the Baphomet disappeared and once again was being held by the man, their strenghts complementing each other."This is what i wanted to see~, time for the final round hubby~"The Lilim disappeared again in a flash and harassed him without a pause, but different from his giant partner before, he was at the same size as her and could hone into her position to parry and counter her strikes almost as if he had clairvoyance, soon she begun harassing him with spells once again, each slash of hers exploding at the point of contact, and her dark orbs hunting him like hounds while she slashed away, lewd tentacles made of compressed dark were added and the space fissure spell reared it's ugly visage once again, making it even harder to counter attack. By now the warrior was reduced to a passive state of pure defense and evasion, slashing at her every so often it wasn't enough damage to stop her even after the damage she received from the Baphomet incarnation, he began tiring out."Ara is my dear tiring out~ will my dear admit his defeat, you satisfied me more than enough hubby, i'm more than happy in dropping all this violence and become yours by now~" the Lilim flirted and her charm creeped inside his mind telling the man it was enough, that the battle was over and for him take the spoils that offered themselves to him."NO! I lived my entire life waiting for this day, i'll only admit defeat once in utterly broken to the ground, and i won't accept you ending this battle and trampling at our pride like this!" the warrior roared and slashed away like a berserker, destroying her spells utterly while the sword cheered for his bloodthirst once again."That's the spirit hubby~" the woman laughed and indulged on the warrior's desires, conquering men with only her charms was so boring for this Lilim nowadays, she was grateful that this one wouldn't fall so easily.Slash clang boom clink crunch boom whooosh cling clang Slash creak BOOM shatter splashThe fight continued for what it felt like ages and eventually the Lilim, a being with almost infinite energy became tired, the warrior who was just a human and by all accounts should've fallen long ago kept going with just the power of his will, even the sword couldn't take more of this as it lost count on how many times it transformed itself to double team the Lilim, drinking from her filled it with energy to go on but it could feel her reserves were almost depleted at it healed less and less."(This is it partner, it's time to use your holy attack once again, either you or her, the time to decide a victor is upon us)" the sword spoke to his mind and he nodded."Druella, it's time to fulfill my revenge, give me your best shot!" the Warrior threw the Cursed Sword at her and Charged behind."Y-you are a big tease you know what, but fine i too lost my patience since long ago!" The woman charged at him, she evaded the sword only to be stopped by it after it transformed once again and gripped at her body covering her vision with its giant body."Get off me you eyesore!" the woman tried her best to escape from its grip to no avail, before being swung around by it and watching with horror what their plan was."NOW MY PARTNER!" the excited sword said."OHHHHHHHH" the Warrior put all his spirit into his fist to use the Holy attack, this area they were began sapping at him fast, since it was her realm and now he forgone his defenses to favor one decisive strike, either he ended this or he would cum silly until he fainted."GYAAAHHHH you teasing asshole! Ahh i love you so fucking much! IT HURTS!" The strike connected with her body and she felt a mix of great pleasure and great pain, for the first time since the rising of the new Demon Lord a Lilim was defeated, and one of the most haughty and power hungry of them at that, the Lilim kept kicking around trying to escape this pleasuring pain she was feeling, losing her power more and more.ShatterCracks around the entire space began appearing and the warrior stopped feeling the weakening effects of this realm, soon the nightscape was filled with light and all of them disappeared in a flash.Back at the throne roomThe worried girls were making plans for the future if their beloved appeared married with the Lilim, and how to plead at the princess to let them taste him too.ShatterThey heard a crack and soon enough the warrior appeared with ragged breaths, standing while holding himself up with the help of the sword as a stick while the princess was fallen in the ground with a expression they knew all too well."I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT HUBBY AWOOOO!" the Werewolf ran all over while wagging her tail.OH NOM "MY HUBBY SHOWED HER A LESSON~" NOM NOM "ORCS WILL NEVER BE CONSIDERED CANNON FODDER EVER AGAIN" SLURP PFAHH the Orc having found some alcohol and meat had a blast while talking with her mouth full spitting everywhere."WELL YOU YOU LOOK AT THAT, THE ASSHOLE DID WHAT EVERYONE THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE!" The Ogre rushed and slapped the man almost making him fall to the ground."YOU ARE A TRUE WARRIOR MY LOVE, I FUCKING ADORE YOU" the Lizardman nodded and slapped him as well."I'M SO FUCKING WET RIGHT NOW, SOMEONE BRING WATER!" the Salamander at this point was literally a living fireball."WE ARE PROUD OF YOU CHIEFTAIN ROOOAAAR" The amazons cheered as if they just won a war."Congratulations master, it was magnificent, i'll never regret having taken your hand" the Kunoichi appeared and helped the warrior stand up after being slapped twice."Nii-chan, forgive me please, i promise i will be a good girl from now on, so don't hate me ok? please?! i can even disband my sabbath if you want, just to stay with you please" a crying Baphomet appeared from a portal and ran to the man, he never thought he could change her nature, but now she was promising something that goes completely against her nature.The warrior caressed her head, forgiving her in the process, she "meeehh'd" with happiness at this."(I knew you could do it partner, damn, we did the impossible didn't we, as i said before, when i finish digesting all the energy i drank from her, i promise you that you won't be affected by the Demon Lord aura when you meet the woman)" the Sealed Baphomet said with confidence."Than you all for the support until now" this would be their cue to drop any courtesies and try to rape the man silly now that he truly was one step away from falling, but they decided to let him bask in the well earned victory for now.Away from the party currently happening the fallen maidens of Lescatie talked between themselves."The princess has fallen, something we couldn't even hope to accomplish when we were human, this man did without losing himself~" the Dark knight spoke."Is it the result of having to fend all these girls by himself for so long?" the Dark priest spoke, remembering her first meeting with him back at the forest."Maybe we should train our Elt dearest to be like him one day~" the echidna added."But i like him cute and frail like this~" the roper denied the echidna."I concur with the princess, we should protect our dear from all harm" the Elf werewolf closed the case."I will train to one day reach his level and protect my beloved wives" the man now awake from all the snusnu he lived, thought to himself while watching the WarriorBack at the party"W-Well, i need to admit, never in my life i thought i would find someone worthy of me, rejoice my dear, you just earned yourself a beautiful Lilim wife~" Druella rose up with wobbly legs aching all over with pain and pleasure, before turning herself into the toned giant that was his type."We won't let you steal him from us!" the girls surrounded the man as if to protect him from the newcomer."YEAH YEAH" they roared."Oh my~ little girls, i'm sure we can reach a consensus and learn to share~" the woman used her charisma to charm them to her side."(This is bad partner, better you defuse this bomb fast, either you won't be meeting the Demon Lord)" the sword warned him and the warrior nodded."Before that, Lilim!" the man said with authority and made the girl flinch."Y-yes my hubby dearest, do you want to take me right now, i'm ready to share our vows~" The domineering girl melted like butter."Take me to the Demon Lord, i need to give her a big piece of my mind!" the warrior demanded."To mommy? Will you ask my hand to her yourself? YES I CAN DO IT HUBBY~ You all are invited too!" the Lilim together with the little Baphomet and the Demon who just appeared and looked at the warrior with a mysterious smile opened the biggest portal they could, since Royal Makai was far away from here and the energy required to transport everyone was immense, soon everyone disappeared.Royal Makai Demon Lord's throneThis as a day like any other in the life of the Demon Lord, hardcore sex with her husband, pampering her daughters and working to make the mamono give birth to humans as well and solve the bleak future of mutual extinction that waited for them all, something that kept her awake with worries every night."Hmm?" The Demon lord felt the energy signature of her most spoiled daughter opening at her throne and stopped her lovemaking with dear Arthur to welcome her child.A giant portal appeared and from it a bunch of unmarried monsters came immediately kneeling down to her after feeling her power which surprised the couple, was a surprise party supposed to happen here?"Mommy!" the voice of her spunkiest child came next and the Lilim jumped at her supple bosom."Welcome my dear, what brought you to us today with so many friends?""Listen mommy, i finally found someone worthy, i present to you my future hubby, and these are his other wives~" she said with excitement point to the middle of all the monster girls who parted in the middle to show off the man.This surprised the demon lord, she didn't think her daughter would want to share someone with others even more if the catch was worthy in her eyes, then she and her husband looked at the place the Lilim pointed and could feel the surging flare of power in front of them.A Calm looking chiseled man, with determination on his eyes, who even though battered after a battle they could only imagine still gazed back at them as if issuing a challenge.A demonic sword in his hands pulsing with their daughter own energy and something far more ancient gazed upon the pair, it's eyes famished telling the couple it wanted to drink from them next."Isn't he dreamy~ He just defeated me and wanted to meet you right after~" the Lilim squealed like a maiden in love."Yes my dear i can see it, he reminds me of your father when we were young and traveled around the world" the Demon Lord smiled and the ex hero nodded, the man in front of them was a true warrior of the kinds he didn't see anymore."So, my dear what do you want to talk about with us?" the Demon Lord smiled at the man, with just this gesture anyone in her presence would be reduced to a mess, but this man held on thanks to the protection of his partner and his own willpower, and answered while looking straight at her eyes."Fight me, and make me reach even greater heights!" The warrior issued the challenge and took a stance, everyone he conquered before including Druella did a "squee" of excitement at his challenge, amusing the Demon Lord and the Ex Hero."And why should we accept this? we live in a era of peace, there's no need to defeat the Demon Lord anymore hero, why won't you just find peace with all these lovely girls and enjoy your honeymoon in our castle?" the woman was curious about this human."I know there's no need to defeat the Demon Lord, but you are mistaken if you think i am a hero, i'm a warrior and you are the strongest beings above her, so it's only natural for me to challenge you and improve myself even further!""WELL SAID PARTNER!" The Sword spoke with excitement"If you refuse to fight him because of his reasons then fight him as repayment for all the help i gave to you!" it ordered."And who would you be my dear?" the Demon Lord smiled at the gall of this one, but most cursed swords of her time were prideful after all."Did you forget me missy? I'm pretty sure your kind feared me enough to make scary children stories involving me at those times KUFUHEHEHE" the thing laughed maniacally.The Demon Lord raised an eyebrow."Well, let this magnificent me spark your memory then, who do you think weakened the old Demon Lord and his generals enough so you lovebirds could even have a chance of defeating them hmm~?""The Sealed one!" The woman was shocked, how the hell could this man bond with one of the most dangerous beings of her times, and how he could even find him in the first place?"At your service KUFUHEHEHAHAHAH" it kept laughing at the couple and soon enough the Ex Hero was walking down the stairs ready to meet them."This make things interesting, let's accept his challenge my dear, it's only fair we pay our debts to our benefactor" the Man willed his armor and sword now long corrupted by Demonic energy."If you put it this way i can't refuse it my beloved~" The Demon Lord changed herself to the form she used when she adventured around the world."Mommy and Daddy are so dreamy~ But i'll cheer for hubby today! Go my dear, defeat them and make me proud!" the Lilim began cheering with the others joining her and the couple had a strained smile."Who ever thought our daughter would wish for our defeat one day" the woman pouted."It's his value as a fighter, we should respect him and do our best" the man approved."You are right my dear~" the woman pointed at the warrior and he felt warmth, not one of lust but one of recovery soon enough his depleted reserves were filled to the brim just like he was before fighting with the Lilim, the man had a strange look in his eyes."It wouldn't be fair of us to battle you weakened like that" the Demon Lord explained her actions."Consider it our gift for being worthy in our daughter's eyes" the man added."(this is it partner, our final battle, let us go with a bang no matter the outcome!)" the Sealed One encouraged him."OUHHH!"Warrior and Sword rushed against the Demon Lord and her dark Hero, their battle shaking the very foundations of Royal Makai and making a new legend for ages to come, the outcome of their battle and the Warrior's future? I'll let the reader decide it.End note: Thanks for reading this, leave a review will you.

    What if 1: Vs the WerewolfThe battle was fierce, the Warrior gave his all but in the end he couldn't evade as well as he thought he could, even so he defeated the pack."You're strong, please be our alpha hubby, please bless us with your seed~" the girls implored to the man now completely tamedThe pack of beautiful werewolves with their silver manes shined under the moonlight, panting and exhausted their ethereal beauty glistened with droplets of sweat and steam forming from their hot athletic bodies, a bestial musk wafting its way into the man's nostrils he did his best to refuse, but his will was shattered at last, the final strike against his spirit was the most beautiful of them all, the stubborn werewolf that gave him the greatest trouble during this fight swayed her hips while submitting herself, her honey pot glistening with the sweetest nectar, her firm buttocks and legs begging for him to caress them, her fluffy tail which could make the kitsune-clan green eyed with envy swaying happily at him."I shouldn't, i shouldn't accept this, but as you said it's my right as the victor" the warrior dropped his weapon and walked to the girl."Time for a new battle, a battle of the flesh and to decide who is the leader" he announced much to the girls happiness.The warrior began caressing her with great interest on her well toned muscles, his rugged hands sending waves of pleasure all over her body, the man nibbled at her ears much to the girl's glee, soon he descended to her neck, taking off her collar he gently kissed her fragile looking neck leaving hickeys on it, her beautiful pale skin was being marked as his property and she wouldn't have it any other way"Ahnn hubby~ tease me more!" the panting doggy was sweating more and more with expectations, releasing more of the fragrance that threatened to shatter his mind, his gentleness was unexpected after the fierce battle and this caught her by surprise.The warrior who kept caressing the girl, searching for her pleasure spots then felt a rush of cold air on his groin followed by a warmth that threatened to melt him completely, when he looked down he saw the other girls with sparkles on their eyes playing with his throbbing manhood, not only their alpha was strong but his girth added to his own musk almost sent them into a frenzy."Easy girls, you all will have a taste, but she's my chosen one and your from now on your leader" the warrior said and they complied after suckling some more making sure to imprint his taste into their minds, with their job done they took his manhood out of their wanting mouths and aligned it with their leader's pussy but never gave them any private space, they wanted to see and sniff their leader's smell mixing together."Hubby~ i love you so much, pierce me, mate me breed me~" the flirty girl pleaded more and more while swaying her hips and caressing his face with her tail now knowing that he has a smell fetish."As you wish my cute doggy, prepare yourself" the man's reason was gone by now, with his switch flipped he pierced her with bestial fury not giving a damn if he would hurt her now."AHNNNNN~ AWOOOOOOO" The girl's insides trembled and she almost fell, all the preliminaries built up to a melting orgasm when he pierced her with such fury, the girl squirted all over the faces of the rest of her pack, but the man held her firm against his body and kept ramming away, making wet noises and foam with her juices."Ahnn~ Awoo~ T-This is it hubby~ breed me like the animal we are, no need for gentleness now, J-just ruin me~!" The werewolf not wanting to lose increased her tempo and pounded her ass back at the man"Bad doggy, just stay still and let me pleasure you!" Not wanting to be interrupted by the girl, knowing monsters are at their strongest when fucking a man, he lifted her up from the doggy position and then fucked her with her legs spread for the others to see forcing his core muscles to the max, the girls unable to control themselves began suckling on his testicles while breathing deep to never forget this fragrance, they kissed him all over while getting a facial from the foam that their leader was spitting out of her pussy which by this point looked she would lose this battle even thought it was doing everything possible to keep him inside."Just like this, just like this hubbyyyyy~!" the girl trembled again with another brainmelting orgasm, her pussy was like greedy mouth now literally munching on his dick with everything it had, each time he pulled out her inner lips would glue themselves to his cock refusing to let him go, the pressure he was feeling was immense, his dick begged his brain for sweet release but the man refused to let her taste his semen, no he would build it up to the max, his objective was to utterly drown her womb with just one shot.hours later"Ohh hubby~ ple-se~ forgiv... it's too sensitive ahnnnn~!" the man never lost his pace, sometimes he would go slow and show her mercy, only to immediately betray this bitch and ram her so hard she felt as if his dick was entering places it shouldn't, by now they did many athletic positions and the other girls could only watch."What's up with this stamina! she already passed out and he still didn't cum! Hubby please she can't continue like this, please cum!" the girls attacked all the weakspots their monster instincts knew and even massaged his prostate."Bite me" the man ordered as he fell down into the girl now for a mating press, it was the time to end her once and for all"What?" the girls asked worried"On the neck, bite me as if you mean it!""A-hh h-hubby please... no more too sensit AHHHHNNNN~" the wolf girl had one more shattering orgasm that this time made her eyes go white and pass out, her tired pussy in a last effort to drink his energy clenched the hardest it could during this entire night."NOW!" the Warrior Roared as the wolves not only bitten him with enough force to drawn blood they also gave him a bonus and began biting all over and not just at his neck."TAKE IT ALL!"splurt splurt splurt splurtwith a orgasm that felt like his own soul was drawn out, he deposited inside this poor puppy what it felt like his entire existence worth of semen."...!" the unconscious girl body responded and crossed her legs behind him, digging her teeth deep into his neck while also scratching his entire back, it took his penis deep inside to drink every single drop, every single sperm as payment for everything she suffered during this night, her reward finally at hand she was reinvigorated by the high quality spirit energy that was being injected while also feeling and something that shouldn't be happening right now was in fact happening, the man a human man who wasn't a incubus yet just with one shot fertilized her, the bliss this brought to her made her cum again harder than before."Ahnnnnn~ AWOOOOOOOOOOO! Hubby~ Hubby impregnated me~ i can feel iiiiiiit~!" she spasmed again and and almost passed out, but not before being caressed by the man."You were a good girl, now rest" with a gentle smile he kissed her, the last thing she would see during this night, the girl closed her eyes with a smile as the man calmly rose up from their position then lifting her before walking away and laying her body down onto his clothes, a girl shouldn't be sleeping on the ground after all. the werewolf covered herself sniffing happily on his smell."WHAT!?" The girls who still were biting the Warrior released their grip from his body and looked with shock."The blessing of a child, i promise i will give him everything that was taken away from me" he looked at the sleeping girl once again before turning at the others with a predatory smile, they weren't the monsters here."Now that the leader is out, who's next" the warrior said, he could have ultimately lost his battle due to his own mistakes and falling to temptation, his journey was over, but these girls would learn that this man was born to be their Alpha.What if 2: Vs the OrcsThe Warrior had a good rhythm going on, so good in fact he began feeling cocky about it, a inflated ego being his downfall soon the orcs got the upper hand and knocked him out, the last thing he saw was the werewolf face filled with tears and shock of his rival."Hubby!" the Werewolf cried."Sorry girlie but to the victor goes the spoils~ better luck next time" the Orcs laughed and took him away to be ravaged in their camp...."Where am i?" Groggily the man woke up to find himself in a cage, the Orcs trying to decide who would taste him first."Well he did put up a good fight~"."But he didn't win! we only submit if they win!""Still...""So i lost huh, and my rival... i failed her, i failed myself" the man was crestfallen while the orcs kept discussing, their bickering was grating on his nerves and he had enough of this, so what if he lost once? he wasn't raped yet he still had a chance to win as long as he didn't fell."HEY YOU BITCHES!" The man Roared getting the attention of everyone"Instead of bickering on who gets to fuck me first, i issue a challenge to you! 1 vs 1, until the other falls or admits defeat, those who fell by my hand before and are indecisive can rematch me again, you'll see that i'm not some food you can eat without being biten back!""AHAHAHAHAHAH, this man is a bigger catch than expected, so be it hubby~ let's see how you'll fare with our entire camp" they accepted the challenge...."How could he win!? Ahhhhhhhhh! So dreamy~ we submit hubby~!" reflecting on his earlier mistake the warrior subjugated the entire camp and now would eat lots of ham as compensation.He grabbed the one who struck him down before, she would be the target of his ire before the rest, ripping what little clothes she had into shreds and violently throwing her to the ground, the warrior furiously stabbed her unprepared hole while insulting the pig slut the worst and most cruel things imaginable making the other orcs afraid even thought their own submission instinct forced them to practically lay their lives down for their new master."Oink for me you whore, pay for what you did to my rival!" furiously the warrior slapped the flabby thing in front of him, making the woman tighter the more punishment he delivered."Oink hubb-" SLAP "Ahhh!""YOU SHALL ONLY OINK YOU BITCH NO OTHER WORD MUST COME OUT OF YOUR DISGUSTING MOUTH!" the warrior pounded away at the orc, he didn't care about her pleasure, about fulfilling her needs as a woman, this was for all intents and purposes masturbation to him."Oink! oink! oink!" the submissive orc was in utter bliss, and tightened even more, the muscles bellow her fat were a true challenge for the man when he noticed there was more than meets the eye with these orcs, he wouldn't admit it thought.SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP"Ahnnnnnn~ Oink!" the orc clenched violently and orgasmed her pussy milking him for all he was worth, such was her strength, the man couldn't stop himself from creaming her as well, splurt splurt splurt his anger only increased against this woman in front of him who was looking at the man as if he was her fated one, then.SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP"HOW DARE YOU SLUT? HOW DARE YOU TAKE EVEN A DROP OF MY SEMEN, SPILL IT OUT, NOW!" spite lust and rage were the only things on his mind.SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAPThe orc loved being treated like this, her orgasm only got stronger, she was having multiples now with how enraged he was punishing her, then he got closer to her ear so no one would be able to listen filling her with expectations, but with a cold voice said the most cruel thing a mamono could ever hear."You will never have a child with me, not ever, even after i turn into a incubus you and you alone i will hate" the orc expression full of bliss became a blank of horror, tears bubbling out from her reddened eyes.The man rose up and left to hate fuck another orc, the ones who were in doubt or were defeated before would get his pity, the ones who wanted to treat him like cattle would get his hate."sniff sniff UWWWWWWHHHHEEEEE oink UWEEEHHHHH" the other orcs could only imagine what horrible thing the warrior said to break their friend like this, but soon enough they would know.What if 3: Vs the LizardmanThe man would fight dirty to win and dirty he fought, soon enough he was caressing the lizardman and melting her with his dexterous hands, pined under him her face became hotter and hotter looking at his features, feeling his breath and masculine scent wafting into her nostrils, then he put his hand under her leotard and lowered it tracing her beautiful muscles born from years of training enjoying the sensation, his heart beating faster and faster, soon enough he was poking her wet hole through her leotard and by now she forgot all about their battle, she wanted him inside."NOT FAIR!" The Werewolf and Orc complained."You're beautiful" the warrior spoke before taking her lips with a deep kiss, the finishing strike for her and himself."hn!""A woman like you is everything i searched for" parting their lips and gazing upon her tomboyish visage he only got more and more charmed."B-but our duel" the Lizardman spoke, as it didn't decide a winner yet."Can't you see? i already won, your body submitted entirely to me and now i'm taking my battle spoils, or you dislike the idea Lizardman?" the man spoke with a saddened tone at the end."I also searched for a man like you hubby~" the girl admitted her loss, she wasn't a warrior anymore, she was a innocent maiden unable to resist the advances of this rugged knight on top of her.Lowering her hand, the girl caressed his member poking at her for a time now and giggled feeling the great amount of precum, she bought it back to her mouth and tasted it."Ahn" It was the sweetest nectar, she completely forgot all the good foods she had before, nothing could compare, now she wanted it inside her and taste the thick rich cream inside."Put it in my beloved~" the girl said as she pulled her leotard to the side and let his cock kiss her entrance which now was as wet as a slime girl.Deciding to tease the beautiful girl in front of him instead of impaling her, he teased her lips using only his tip, each time it made contact her lips kissed and glued to him not wanting to let the man go, her pussy with a mind her own saddened wanting to embrace her beloved completely into her depths could only complain by producing more and more lube."Please, no more teasing, please put it inside!""I don't think i will my beloved, i've read some nice things about your species, on how you love being teased until you can't endure anymore~" the man flirted with her"Ahnn~ that's not true! please my warrior please!"they continued like this for about 10 minutes before the man also was at his limit, her liquids were hotter than magma, he didn't know where his cock ended and her pussy began anymore, he just wanted to fill this woman in front of him."Ahnnn!" "HNNNNNNRGHHH" slpurt slpurt slpurt squirt squirt squirtThe warrior jammed it entirely inside the Lizardman making her reach a instant orgasm, her well trained core muscles clenching so hard it felt like a guillotine and his dick was the criminal deserving death for having teased her so long, this brought him to the limit as well releasing everything inside the girl, every sperm cell being produced right now was being pumped inside her, there was no time to hoard them, each time a new batch was ready he offered them to his beloved, his testes going into overdrive to offer as much as they could to the woman in front of him, after 3 minutes of non stop coitus both were basking in the post orgasm bliss."This was everything i ever expected and more" the lizard girl caressed her new husband"Yes, for me as well" the man utterly spent smiled looking at her, his gamble was a risky one and he failed utterly in the end, the man couldn't escape her charms."I hope you aren't forgetting about someone hubby~" the couple looked at the girls who had a mysterious grin on their faces."Ah right, these are my dear rivals, i used to train with them during my journey until now" the Man explained to the lizardman who was piecing the puzzle."And we love him just as much as you do Lizardman!" the orc harumphed."Neh hubby why you feel for her charms but not for ours, we too are toned and tomboyish" the werewolf ears fell with sadness."Well, when i began caressing her as a last gamble to win, i just didn't want to stop, you are my types just as much as my beloved" He kept caressing the Lizardman who was half glad for having won him first and half angry because her hubby would 3 time her with the others."Hubby~ for playing with a maiden heart like this you know what awaits you right?""Yes... Can we have a multiple marriage my dear?" the man looked at her expression and it was a smile."As punishment you'll have to give me 3 times the amount you'll be giving to them later hu~u~bby~" the girl was angry, but couldn't do much of anything, the nature of mamono couldn't stop a man like him from having multiple wives."Thank you sis!""Now let's partake at last!"Suffice to say the Warrior's journey ended here, he never stopped his training to be stronger but not it was more core exercises than swordplay, he had to satisfy 3 monsters after all.What if 4: Vs the Ogre"Hubby! Nooooooooo!" the girls were in despair, the worst thing happened, the warrior evasion by a hair width gamble was too risky and he failed in the end, with a well delivered punch from the Ogre the man fell, then was picked up as a sack of potatoes and kidnaped to god knows where...."Hnnng, what?" The man woke up with a sadistic looking woman smiling at him like he was lower than dirt while she kept jumping at his dick."Ohh you woke up already meat~ for a moment i was afraid you would be just a cum dispenser for me, if it wasn't for your little friend being so lively i thought i had killed you~ Ahnn~" the Ogre teased him never stopping from her wild ride soon enough she would getting her reward."Hnnnng" splurt splurt splurtthe Warrior felt weakened from the battle before and now was even more weakened thanks to cumming inside the monster."You're so tasty! but you have more don't you? Give me more my delicious meat~" the woman swung her hips in a circular fashion to squeeze until the last drop."So are you" the man said stopping the big girl on her tracks."What the fuck did you say?" the Ogre snarled."You are my type" the warrior came open with his tastes."You consider this a battle wont you? either i lose and become meat for your amusement or i win and become your beloved and master" the warrior remembered very well her entry in the encyclopedia."Ara~ the little meat knows about the Ogres, and even knowing that you challenged me, i lucked out and got a perv GAHAHAHA" the Ogre resumed her milking, if the man liked her then accepting his fate as meat would be all fine and dandy."Yes i am a pervert, only someone insane would train his entire life to confront the Lilim and employ the help of monsters attacking him constantly as a training method" this got a whistle of approval from the Ogre he was a bloodthirsty bastard just like he acted."And now Ogre, i will show you that i am your equal!" the man said with determination.The warrior began pumping hard from bellow the girl, employing all his core muscles to confront the monster making the Ogre laugh at his actions, he just sealed his fate and his pelvis would become fine powder now."Bad idea meat~ fighting a Ogre while bellow one is the dumbest thing you could ever do... What!?"The warrior then pinched her nipples and began caressing them, suckling, massaging, biting, his caressing climbed to her her face, ears, horns, nape."You asshole!" the Ogre was furious, this piece of meat was hitting all her sensitive spots, her pussy relaxed for a instant because of this.The warrior not missing his change changed his posture getting up while bending the ogre backwards, he wouldn't be free from her but at least he could make it not so one-sided, now they were fucking while sitting embraced gazing at one another's eyes, determination and a iron will in their expression."You really are beautiful" the man compliments her."STO- HNF?!"The warrior jammed his tongue inside the Ogre's mouth shutting her up and exploring her flesh, like a slithering snake his tongue explored her entire oral cavity and the woman did the same to his.pfuhah"W-Well, my meat has balls, but if you think i'm weak to lovel dovey shit like this you're wrong?!" catching her breath from the tonguing she just got the woman kept teasing the man.The warrior pushed her further back and now was on top of the woman, the girl crossed her legs at his back and smiled with a predatory grin."You just signed your death sentence you asshole, i won't release you until you satisty me!" the woman laughed before being deeply kissed once again."It will be my pleasure" the man smiled at her wordsThe warrior now in a position that favored him would make this haughty woman submit and began pounding hard at her, she felt like it wasn't a dick inside but a fist punching her womb non stop.plap plap plap plap"What do you think of my little friend now that he's truly awake, instead of raping him while i was passed out my dear~" the warrior spoke close to her ear before licking and nibbling it, earning a moan as response"N-Not bad meat, i must admit you know some moves" the Ogre was loving this but would never fully admit it."Ahnnn~" she had a mini orgasm.As if on cue the warrior kept punching womb her harder and harder, and she kept her leg lock on him like a vice pulling him back inside with so much strength he felt his spine would snap each time he pulled it out to pierce her more."You really like violent sex, not caring about your partner at all" he commented feeling the backpains."What of it? chickening out my little meat~ is the tiny man unable to sate the big bad monster?" the woman teased."No, in fact i'm loving you more and more, i give you my permission break my everything and reforge my body into something even greater my beloved~" the man flirted and for the first time the Ogre blushed."It's your grave, meat~"The man put even more strength into his thrusts, if before she felt like she was being punched, now it was a battering ram trying to destroy the castle walls of her cervix, the warrior wanted in and will get in!"Wait wait wait this isn't supposed to happeeeeennn!" the woman felt the danger to her insides and tried to escape releasing her leg lock but it was too late, the man wouldn't ever let her escape!plop"AHNNNNNNN~" the Ogre heard about this bout never thought this would happen one day to her, this man just pierced her most sacred spot and was destroying it completely with his Ogre of a cock."MORE~ MORE~ MORE~ HUB~ I MEAN MEAT!" feeling pure ecstasy mixed with some amount of pain, her womb was doing everything to either milk the man or kick him out from it, sadly for her precious womb he was here to stay."AHNNNN YESSSSS~!" The Ogre had a brain rocking orgasm and her contractions sucked everything from the man."HNNNF OGRE!" The man pierced her even deeper than before, and as if her womb wanted his fertile seed at its deepest, he felt like he was piercing yet another hole inside her, then released everything inside the Ogre's fallopian tubes, caking her ovaries with sperm.splurt splurt splurtsquirt squirt squirt"AHNNNN~" the pleasure was so much that the Ogre fainted and released him completely while pissing herself, her pussy still squeezing everything he had wanting to make a new life inside her with his seed, but soon his dick would soften enough to get out from her depths."You truly are beautiful" the man kissed her gently and caressed her head before rising up and searching in this cave for any type of food or water he could get, soon enough the Ogre would wake up again and demand a rematch, only if he won a second time she would accept being his woman. Finding some food and water that still looked edible for humans, the man recovered his strength before waiting patiently for the Ogre to wake up.sometime later"That was the best but if you think i will accept defe- Hnnf?!" the Ogre woke up just to have the man jam his dick inside her mouth while he licked her pussy"Oh you woke up already my love? i was feeling lonely so i began it before you" the man licked away at her honey pot, his semen long gone absorbed by the monster, it saddened him that the chances of a new life being born with her was so slow even after what he did just now."I'll keep trying, soon we'll have to build a happy place for our children that would be a dream come true" the man said making sure the Ogre heard it, making her flustered."This lady killing asshole! But raising a family huh? maybe being lovey dovey with this meat won't be so bad every now and then..." the Ogre thought to herself and suckled him away, tasting every single vein and curve of his, its overpowering scent from their last round threatened to make her dumb from the smell of her pussy mixed with his dick and cum and she fucking loved it, soon enough the man who wanted to give her pleasure stopped licking her and began face fucking the monster furiously while she was doing her best to accept his girth."Ogre your mouth is so good! I'm melting! it's hot, too hot!"" all reason gone the warrior became an animal.pound pound pound pound"So this is what was beating me before? i can't breathe!" The Ogre regreted giving him headpound pound pound pound"Oi asshole you wanna break my neck with this? it's too big!" The bulge forming at her neck would make one think she was a lamia trying to swallow an entire prey.pound pound pound"Oh no no no no, this is a joke end, is this how i fucking die? drowing in cum?" The Ogre feared for her lifesplurt splurt splurt splurtsquirt squirt squirt squirt"AHHHHHHNNNNNNN~" the suffocation, the fact the man once again reached a place he shouldn't and pieced her stomach sphincter, the fact he was violently fucking her without a care in the world, the fact he asked to build a family with her, and the fact copious amounts of the tastiest semen she ever had was being injected inside her with such force made the Ogre once again pass out while pissing herself.plop"Hmm? Ogre? hey Ogre!? OGRE!" Out of his sex induced insanity after detaching himself from the woman, the man despaired when seeing the girl completely unresponsive, did he kill her, what kind of bad taste ending is this?!coff coff coff buheeehhh"Hey you asshole! that last part was too much! i almost died here!" The Ogre with tears in her eyes kept coughing and sneezing cum and phlegmHug"Thank god, i thought i lost you Ogre!" the Warrior embraced the woman, not caring about her current disgusting condition."H-hey, stop it... i won't die so easily... didn't you want to build a family with me... damn i can't abandon you now can i it would be too much of a joke" the girl embraced him back and caressed the man."Get yourself ready hubby~ if i want to feel pierced again~ you bastard how the hell you even got inside my tubes?" cervix and falopian penetration, the Ogre never felt so destroyed like today, this man lost to her during their fight but proved himself more than worthy in the one fight that really matters."I can pierce you as many times as you want my love~" the man caressed her face before kissing her."Oh stop that, i'm all dirty and disgusting with snot" she was self conscious she wasn't at her best right now."You are beautiful for me no matter how you are..." the man kept caressing and cuddling with her."So this is how you conquered those girls heh you perv?" this was a first for the Ogre, one of the most feared monsters being the small spoon in a relationship."My rivals!" the warrior came to the realization."What about those weak monsters?" the woman asked."Ogre, i promised them that if i ever fell and was defeated in my journey then... I would accept their advances..." the warrior fucked it up"Huhhhhh, i seeeeee, you wanna cheat on me with others is that righ ~" the woman turned around and smiled to him, a smile that meant death."Before that let's fulfil your wish, the one about breaking your everything and reforging your body into something greater, since now you'll have to satisfy me 10 times the amount of times you do with each one of them~" the Ogre kept smiling, the fate of someone who wants an harem of monsters is bleak in this world.The warrior smiled, caressed her hair then kissed her."Everything for you my beloved" were his last words before being utterly destroyed.
  
    Chapter Text
    What if 5: the Warrior kingThe amazon chieftain and the warrior were the last ones standing while all the others lay defeated around them, his companions cheering for yet another victory."You are truly worthy of being our husband, no your power made you be worthy of being our chieftain, wouldn't you accept taking us all as your wives?" the chieftain offered, his worthiness was proven, the woman did something no one would expect from their species and bowed to the man pleading at him instead of trying to mount him.Pondering his choices, and looking all around at their battle field of beautiful tanned bodies the man couldn't bring himself to refuse them this time."I accept" the Warrior looked at the woman and raised her above his shoulders "Tell me where your tribe is, i will defeat all of you and solidify my position as your new leader, and you better have no kidnaped people in there either i will finish you all""WHAT THE FUCKING HELL?""Hubby no way!""You perv~!""You really want to kill yourself don't you?""(So this is where our adventure ends partner? maybe it is for the best after all...)"Guided by the leader, the entire tribe moved as in a procession, his angry companions with a mix of many emotions following them and a hidden kunoichi tailing everyone from behind curious at what the warrior would do.Days after, the group finally reached a hidden village inside another forest, which honestly looked bad, he didn't expect such decadence"A MAN! A MAN! CHIEF YOU FINALLY DID IT, OUR VILLAGE IS SAVED!" a bunch of young looking amazons walked out from their huts with curiosity and looking at the catch couldn't help in becoming excited about him."This is it my dear, this is our entire tribe as you can see there's no one kidnaped, we all followed Druella because we were the weakest of our kinds and couldn't find a single man until now""Chief, why are you treating this man as if he's our superior?""Why he's carrying you as if you were the one hunted down?""W-well" the chieftain blushed and when the rest of the tribe looked at the others they could only lower their heads and look away, red with shame the entire thing amused to no end the warrior's other companions and the kunoichi began feeling hot at the man posture, he looked far above everyone else in here."I'm you chieftain now, if you don't approve of it you are free to fight me, i will beat you all into submission and make fine warriors out of you" the man put the the ex chieftain down and issued the challenge."Ahahahah as if you could beat our entire tribe alone, what a joke, ahahahaha, prepare your pelvis human, soon you'll be at the podium ashamed for everyone to rape~" his challenge boiled the blood of the new girls and they attacked...after fighting an army under a rain of arrows, that had stealth at their favor and even a demon trying to mess with his mind, this new battle honestly was disappointing for the warrior and soon enough the entire tribe admitted him as their superior."Now let us begin, make a line and come to me" the man stood at the podium he knew the tribe used to show off their captives to fuck them into submission, and now would do the same to every amazon, and his partners, and the hidden interloper for last.The first to come was the chieftain, the woman knew he could defeat them in combat but to defeat them all with the thing monsters were the most skilled with, soon enough the tables would turn, and she smiled thinking about it."Down" with one word the man knocked the woman to the ground and pounded her away with a mating press, the opposite of these girls favorite position he would put into their very souls the taste of submission to him.slam slam slam slam the podium trembled, threatening to have both fall through it but holding on for its life, as a symbol it wouldn't fall it wasn't allowed to"Ahn ahn ahn ahnn" the amazon with a mix of utter shame and masochism for being raped like this in front of everyone had her values desecrated she lost utterly as a warrior and the example she was setting to the younger generations would fuck up this tribe entire culture.slam slam slam slameach time he stabbed her with his dick she felt like she was being punched in the gut, she couldn't take it anymore and began cumming from her own accord, her pussy like a vice squeezed hard at the man wanting his seed but he wouldn't give her this reprieve, focusing on his core muscles the man completely blocked his rising ejaculation, the warrior had to prove himself to the tribe after all, his adventures would end here but at least he would take an entire settlement of would be raiders and their future generations with him to fade into obscurity.the vicious mating continued for about half an hour now and the girl wasn't taking the stimuli too well anymore, pleasure and pain broke her mind and now she had a silly expression on her face"P-lease.. cum Ggive cum! p-lese!" the chieftain's pussy still milking him like mad while having body shaking orgasms and pissing herself all over the podium pleaded with tears and spit"You'll all have my cum later, for now i must make you submit utterly""I submit hubby i submiiiiiiit~! she was leg locking him and her womb opened, as the last act of submission she let him take her utterly."Good girl" he patted her head and she smiled rubbing herself against his hand!POUND POUND POUND POUND SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAPThe entire village could feel the tremors, and wet noises and by now was in a masturbation frenzy wanting this warrior to dominate them as well, the sound of his engorged testicles furiously slapping against her buttocks sending shivers of pain at the girls even thought they weren't males, everyone wanted the man to finish it and stop torturing his own precious balls."AHNNNNNNNNN~ NOT FAIR HUBBYYYYY~" the chieftain lost, she was utterly conquered body and soul her last orgasm knocked her out and the man didn't cum one single drop.plopFreeing himself from her, the man stepped down from the podium while bridal carrying the chieftain and gently put her down onto some skins the tribe prepared to rest after a hunt, then as a gourmet choosing his next meal he began evaluating the girls in front of him, all of them with eyes glued at his shimmering manhood, wanting it, to be dominated by it, to be destroyed by it."Kyah!" another girl was picked up and carrying her above his shoulders the man kidnaped her to the podium, moans of jealousy and complaining from rest of the tribe being made."Well look at the asshole go, all that fucking and he still didn't come tch he's more of a monster than us!" the Ogre complained before taking some amazon and proceeding to vent her frustrations at the poor girl, lesbianism wasn't her first choice by a long way, but she wouldn't just stand in here and do nothing until the warrior finished his work before giving her some love as well."His balls look so pained, please hubby stop torturing them like this" the orc said worried about the strain he was putting himself into, if he took too long his ejaculation would be ultra creamy, thick, clogging and painful, the orc didn't want to see him in pain even if he was feeling pleasure form it."Fucking an entire warrior race into submission, i couldn't expect less of my dear~" the lizardman began panting hard and soon enough was attacked by other amazons who felt her desires and wanted to fulfill them."Awoooo i want it, i want hubby, please make me your biiiitch awooooooo~" the werewolf with sadness howled to the scene."... my scabbard, you really are worthy of holding me, such thirst, now i know why i bonded with you so well, go and drink them all GYAHAHAH" the girl materializing herself spoke with emotions that weren't there before."He really is dangerous, ahnnn i can't wait for my spot" the kunoichi revealed herself and began masturbating like the others, the rest knew she was there long ago but by this point didn't really care.POUND POUND POUND POUND, the warrior pounded the night away, in the future stories would be told of a nomadic amazon tribe ruled by a single man, attacking other tribes to kidnap their members and save many villages from being raided in the process, the man eventually would be know as the Warrior king, feared and revered by all.What if 6: Nightmare BaphometThe little goat forgone her scythe in favor of her own body, she would beat her nii-chan to submission then ride him until he forgot any adult girl, of course she wouldn't steal him from the others, she was more than happy in making them become lolis themselves so everyone could enjoy their nii-chan."(this is your chance, one last cut and she will be depleted, be careful they are at their strongest when they are cornered, she will try to mount you and rape you, do not let her do it, do not even try to disarm her by caressing or hugging her, it wont work this time!)" the warrior nodded.The little girl charged at him trying to grip his members and pin him down, he wouldn't sidestep it because her reflexes would make her catch him and it would be the end, so he ran backwards while deflecting her strikes, the sword made her wary she didn't want to touch it because at this point it would drink from her without even needing to cut her.Angry at her failures the little girl had an idea."(partner watch out!)"A portal opened behind the man and he stepped inside, the Baphomet quickly followed."Welcome to our sabbath nii-chan~" the girl had a maniacal laugh and all around him were loli type monster girls with different expressions looking at him and at their sister."SLASH" the warrior bisected the Baphomet with the sword while she was gloating"Wha- Ahnnnnnnnnnnnn~ NIIIII-CHAAAANNNN~!" her mana depleted and pleasure replaced her, she began spasming with forced orgasms"THIS IS IT, I REMEMBER WHO I WAS, I WAS THE HIGHEST BAPHOMET BEFORE BEING SEALED BY THE OLD DEMON LORD FOR THREATENING HIS RULE GYAHAHAHAHA THANKS MAN, DRINKING MY LITTLE SISTER HERE OPENED MY EYES!" the Cursed sword jumped from his hands and transformed itself, soon a beautiful goat like girl, with darkened skin like the purest obsidian and chiseled muscles appeared in front of the congregation shocking all the lolis."B-big sister? whyy you want to take nii-chan away from meeee! meehhhh meehhhh!" the orgasming baphomet complained at the thing before her tearing up."Oh you poor little girl, big sister will help you get your nii-chan ok?" she turned around and looked at the warrior, now wasted and deep inside enemy territory, who kept gazing at her with awe, she was totally his type."Ara~ nii-chan wants to taste his big sister~ come here my little boy and lets make a beautiful sabbath~" she offered and the warrior accepted, her charm too strong for him to resist, and by now he really didn't want to anyways, his throbbing manhood exposed after the little girls around understood what was happening and pulled his pants down.But before he could fuck his partner the little girl with spread legs jumped at him and devoured his dick whole."Hnnng?" the warrior looked down and saw the mix of tears and lust in of the Baphomet slamming against him with a grip that threatened to rip his dick apart, the encyclopedia tales about the danger of their ultra tight pussies wasn't exaggeration, but above all he noticed he was too large for her, making a bulge that made him worried he would literally explode her guts."But before you take this magnificent big sister as yours, could you please reward her for making me remember who i was?" His attention was back to his partner who spoke with a gentle tone while looking at the girl, he nodded.Caressing the little goat and swiping her tears away the warrior gently calmed her down and told her to not overexert herself, then with slow movements he began stabbing at her, earning a adorable "meeh" each time."Here here little one, take your time, make it pleasurable for both of us" he rocked the little goat and pampered her, making all the other lolis of the sabbath squee, their big sister finally found the nii-chan of her dreams.This lovey dovey sex continued much for the little goat happiness, but it was becoming harder and harder for the warrior to keep his composure, he could feel her charm creeping inside wanting to remake him, turning into something he disliked, his will fought with everything it had to not let it happen, noticing what was happening with his partner the Cursed sword raised an eyebrow and with a snap of her fingers casted a ward on him and broke this spell, she wouldn't let him fall like this even if it was a reward for the little girl, feeling his soul calming down he looked to his partner and thanked her, to which she just got flustered."t'was nothing at all man, hehe~" the Big girl blushed at his sincere gratitude before looking down at the little devil and giving her a piece of his mind."You are a very bad girl you know that?" the man scolded the little goat who was lost in pleasure donning a impish smile."Nii-chan is a meanie you should have fallen for my charms, and big sister why did you do that buuuhhh" the girl complained and the woman grinned"I said i would reward you, not that i would give him to you, learn to share will ya selfish brat""But still, even if my influence didn't work, i doubt nii-chan can ever return to any grow up after tasting my pussy hehe~" the little Baphomet now used to his girth rocked her hips while gripping him even tighter, if she couldn't mess with his head she would mess with this one."Ah yes, about that, how about a little punishment for what you did~" the Baphomet said with a smile that wasn't a smile and snapped her fingers once again casting another spell both at the little goat and the warrior."AHNNN~!? Big sis- ahnnnn~ what did you ahnnn! this is too muuuuch!""GROAAAHHHHHH" the warrior lost all reason and was like a beserker attacking the little goat insides.SLAM SLAM SLAM SLAM"Just teaching your little pussy a lesson it won't ever forget~" the woman smiled.The sealed Baphomet casted a engorgement spell on the man's cock making something huge even bigger, his dick was thicker than the little girl's torso at this point and so long, it rearranged her internals moving them upwards to let it in, for the little goat she gave a extreme pleasure and pain charm, she would suffer and walk really funny in the next days to come."Nii-chan p-please mercy mmeehh meehhh mehhhh!" the girl cried with pleasure and pain each time he pulled out his improved member from her, her insides prolapsed glued to his member then right after he brutally shoved everything in, if it wasn't her nature as one of the strongest monsters she would be dead long ago.The lolis around in the sabbath could only look with awe and fear at the nii-chan in front of them and the new nee-san, treating their leader as some cumrag, son they became wet and masturbated while calling for him."Meeeh meanie meehhhh~" the Baphomet pussy lost long ago, the famed tightness she was proud of that could make any man fall to the charms of petite girls would be looser than a adult woman that had multiple pregnancies."And now a little plus for my partner lovely balls~ eyyy~" the evil being snapped her fingers once again and a crest appeared on his testicles, the warrior could feel his entire energy being converted into cum, also a itch of some sorts creeping up?"GRUUUAAAAAHHHH!" the warrior roaredSLAM SLAM SLAM SLAM"NIII-CHAAAAAANNNNNN!" the girl criedsplurt splurt splurt splurtLike a dam being opened, inhuman amounts of semen filled the little girl's hole, having nowhere to go they inflated her like a balloon, his enraged tadpoles raping her immature ovaries into releasing their undeveloped eggs, they raped and destroyed many of them as they were being released, her body going into overdrive to please these greedy invaders and make at leastt one egg strong enough to resist the barrage before she was completely depleted, the girls where in absolute horror watching the sexual violence happening, then they noticed something even worse, from their connection sometimes a little tadpole looking thing would fall to the ground and keep flailing around as a fish out of water, when one of the most curious built the courage to pick it up they noticed it was a huge sperm flailing around and soon more would fill the ground and jump at them, the sabbath was throw into absolute chaos from this."GYAHAHAHHAHA THIS IS HORRIBLE~ AND SO AMUSING!" the malicious grown up Baphomet kept laughing at the show before snapping her fingers and a wave of dark spreading from them."Ah what? what happened?!" the warrior looked confused"Nii-chan please, no more... my eggs, my poor eggs, forgive meeehhh mehhhh mehhhh~" the little goat cried on his arms then the man looked at his partner demanding answers."Did you like it? everything was a illusion by this magnificent one~" the woman grinned like a Cheshire cat."sniff Meehhh MEEEHHH sniff MEEEEHHHH" the little goat kept crying and the man did his best to comfort her to no avail and looked at his partner with utter disapproval."I-think it was too much..." the Sealed One regretful from her prank took the little goat on her arms and rocked her around to calm her down"Here here little one, it was just a bad dream, please don't cry" she rocked and soothed her around with a motherly tone in her voice."Meeehh sniff meeehhh""Big sister was too mean, please forgive her ok, i promise i won't do it again..." she kept rocking and lulling the little goat"sniff meehhh""I'm sorry ok, you can ask for anything later please don't let this become a trauma for life, big sister just wanted to reward you, i didn't know it would be so scary" her mood was utterly destroyed, the joy she felt from her prank became complete regret for what she done, in her excitement she just acted like her old self would but these times were too peaceful for such a thing."sniff o-ok... i forgive you nee-chan... i admit it was dreamy being dominated by nii-chan like that... but then you made him scary and i was afraid, please never do it again!""ok i promise, pinky promise at that""Well, some punishment is needed now don't you think?" the man grabbed her shoulders and looked at her with a smile that wasn't a smile."My partner, do it again, this time i will give to you the same thing you made me do to her, also no pleasure charm, you'll have to take everything with only increased pain" he would avenge the little girl."Hehe... partner can't we negotiate this? why are scaring your big sister... heh it was a prank... calm down will you?" she began stepping back but was blocked by the little girls of the sabbath."Nee-chan was a meanie, nee-chan must be punished~""Nooooooo!"Forced to live through the same thing the little one did, the big Baphomet was broken down completely, she would become a fine masochist later and ask for her partner even more deranged plays much to his concern.What if 7: Nightmare incubusThe man defeated the High Orc, tamed the Hellhound made the Salamander into a living fireball and Deboned the manticore spikes, now with the 3 following him after his last victory he stopped and unable to resist this temptation any further the man decided to indulge on them all."I hope you are ready, i still won't forgive you for beating me puny human you will know your place" the Hellhound gnarled at the warrior, these would be the last words she spoke while still remaining her mental faculties.stab stab stab stabwith lots of care to not poison himself he picked up the wasted barbs of the orgasming manticore littering the ground and threw a bunch of them at the girls"What did you do you asshole!" the hellhound complained before the venom took action and melted her into a orgasming puppy, the same happened to the High Orc and the Salamander, the latter one now threatened to burn the entire forest down because the aphrodisiacs only increased their intensity."I'm just indulging on my desires, nothing more" the man walked and kneeled down in front of the manticore who looked at him with spite."W-what do you want you bitch, here to humiliate me even more?" the girl snarled at the man who defeated her."Yes""WHA-"Before she could even protest, the man pierced her wanting pussy against her consent, sex with their vagina instead of their tail was a ritual of bonding, something that only happened when the manticore decided they would dedicate their entire lives to their man, after making them completely addicted to their tail and venom."You asshole! Ahnnn" with the curse of the sword sapping her away and filling her with pleasure she couldn't fight the warrior at all and soon enough bonded with him skipping the formal procedures of her species."Let's not waste time with your tail and poison" the man pounded the girl without a care then raised her up and fucking her while walking he came back to the 3 newcomers he just filled with spikes, putting his sweaty balls and the manticore pussy right in front of the reddened faces of the high orc, hellhound and salamander."LICK IT!" the man ordered, the High Orc and Salamander instantly did as he said to while the hellhound still had fight in her eyes, but soon that fight would be gone once the man without any fear grabbed the manticore's tail and whipped the girl with it piercing her all over with the new barbs.Slap slap slap slap he pierced the manticore, his engorged balls slapping up and down, beating against her ass giving the girl even more stimulus and slapping the girls faces when going down, they were trying their best to lick and suck at them complaining in their minds only 2 balls wasn't enough for everyone.splurt splurt splurt splurt without a care in the word and injecting himself with the aphrodisiac venom as well by rubbing his face all over in the manticore's tail and letting the spikes pierce him, the man too by this point was a pincushion and this only increased his insanity.PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP"Ahhnnnnn~" the manticore orgasmed with the insane penetration, her pussy milking all his cum with everything she had and the trio bellow licking ferociously at any droplet that escaped, the girl squirted all over and just as a malicious joke when she did so, the man targeted the still stubborn hellhound face with it giving her a shower of ejaculate and piss."ROAAAAAARRRR!" hurling the manticore, behind him the man proceeded to facefuck the stubborn dog who still looked at him with a mix of hate and lust, but not before rubbing his cock over her entire face to humiliate the doggy further and also to stab himself with any remaining poison left in the spikes that pierced her."HNNNNF" His penis engorged more than ever thanks to the poison couldn't fit completely inside the girl's mouth anymore and she felt her jaw dislocating to accommodate the monster before her, this ignited her flames more and more and even thought she couldn't breathe she refused to let him go, her pride as a hellhound wouldn't let any man tame her with sex, sadly this was a battle she was fated to lose, the salamander and high orc kept giving him stimuli this time by rimming and caressing his balls to produce more semen while also piercing them with even more aphrodisiac poison spikes, they also stabbed the bulge of his dick on the hellhound's neck, this was enough for him to cum again, this time with even more force thanks to the increased poison.Splurt splurt splurt splurt splurt splurtAs if a dam had been broken his balls kept churning more and more semen drowning the hellhound with it, her tonned belly soon became chubby with all the semen being poured inside."HNNNF!" she felt like she would drown, her rate of consumption wasn't even close to his rate of production, her belly couldn't take it anymore and she began vomiting his semen back, the high orc and salamander licking her all over to taste it.plopPulling his dick out the hellhound's mouth she fell like a puppet with its strings cut, as the only thing keeping her upright was pulled away, she squirted and squirted, if it wasn't for all the liquids inside her right now she would pass out from dehydration.By now the manticore who was hurled back was standing again and with a sadistic smile blasted his entire back with her spikes as payback for what he did to her, a big mistake she would soon realize"ROAAAAAARRRR!" "GYAHAHAHAHAHAH!"Everyone in the jungle heard this, even the Lilim in the monster camp was curious to see the commotion, she then opened a portal to the source and together with the Baphomet and the Demon found out the results of a aphrodisiac maddened warrior, it was a massacre, many bodies sprawled over, no one was forgiven from his ire, his spirit rising to unimaginable heights, the man was a complete incubus by now and he just drank the equivalent of decades of demonic energy from his companions through sex, if the man was strong enough to beat the Baphomet what would happen now that he was a incubus as well mixed with so many different energies?"Lilim..." the creature inside a swirl of reddish darkness felling a unforgettable presence looked at her with a cold expression, this filled the fourth borne with a mix of fear and desire for the thing in front of her, before she could even speak it rushed at the woman, with a laughing sword in hands"THAT'S IT PARTNER, DRINK THEM ALL, MIX YOUR ENERGY WITH THEIRS, BECOME MORE THAN A HUMAN, MORE THAN A HERO, REACH THE PEAK OF THE GODS! GYAHAHAHAHAH!"The ensuing battle would raze down the entire jungle, the man wouldn't forgive the Lilim and would drink and rape her soul out of her body much to her happiness, the man was everything he was hyped up to be finally a hubby worthy of her and she couldn't wait to tell her mom and dad all about it.The Demon had the time of her life in the presence of so much corruption she didn't think twice about of her next actions, consequences be damned she bound everyone's souls together into a contract to keep this decadence going for eternity.The Baphomet summoned her entire Sabbath and was in awe once again of her nii-chan strength, the man rapped all the petite girls as well much to their happiness, the sheer might of demonic energy being released from this insanity blasted away the entire area into a Demonic Realm, no one in Lescatie was ready for this and the town fell as it was fated to happen.A single Valkyrie appeared in the air and cried watching the warrior's fate, he fell completely and now was nothing more than an animal, but soon she began blushing and panting looking at the scene and desiring him, to Hel with it she thought, she developed feelings for the man, so what if he fell? So be it she would fall together with him and support him forever.Later the wandering scholar would write about a incubus warrior so filled with insanity and lust he threatened to topple down the entire order of the world, no wild monster was safe from being taken as his wife, no human was safe from his corruption, the man was a catastrophe of nature and everywhere the storm passed by only moans of pleasure and pools of cum and squirt would be left, with time the warrior after hunting down and marrying all of her daughters while followed by a Baphomet the size of a castle challenged the Demon Lord herself, his fate? Not even the author would know.This is it, the final end, who knew the Warrior would turn into world fucking (literally) catastrophe once he lost his sanity? this is why manticores are dangerous, aphrodisiac poison that induces madness + strong as fuck people with a raging libido who blueballed themselves for months resisting temptation = we screwed it up bois.
