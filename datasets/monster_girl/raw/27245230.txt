    It was a normal day at least for Akihsia till the ground shock and he fell down on top of what looked like a white unicorn with wings and a green flash came turning them to stone.time past planes crashed plants exploded buildings fell apart trees grow. Thanks to being on contact Akihisa could speak to her, her name was celestia, this allowed both their minds to stay active.thousand of years later in his Mind Akihisa saw himself as an anthro version of an alicorn white fur wings his tailand mane his old hair color but with blue green and pink high lights, green eyes.his mental projection of himself was dressed in a green jacket, open with pink lining the zipper the rim of the sleeves blue no shirt under it, brown pants with a brown rope belt holding them up no shoes. He and Celestia thanks to time had developed. But for some reason a crack was on his left eye he didn't know why it just showed up and would glow.Celestia like wise saw herself anthro her mental projection was easily seven foot tall with a figure that would make most models jealous, she had a crack on her visible left shoulder. Her mental projection was dressed in an orange one piece sideless dress that ended at her knees and had no shoulder or neck showing a lot. Orange sleeve gloves with white fur rims around the top gold bands around her wrist, orange stockings orange tiger print heel boots, and she had a wooden staff.the former princess looked at the crack glowing, "What are this?"A voice said, "proof of about to brake free!" they turned to see a man in cold war ever outfit as he said, "Please relax I am a friend I forgot my name just call me scp nine nine zero or nine hundred ninety , or dream man whatever floats your boats!"Akihsia got up as something appeared on his wrist he looked at it to see an omniverse style omnitrix as he said, "look I am just here to tell you what the fuck happened the bad guy got born took peace of other worlds copied them smashed them together and turned all living on it to stone. Well most of them My foundation survived thanks to taking this slave owners underground city before hand. I gave the boy the greatest tool on this world the omnitrix. It'll let him turn in to other things truly ten on quick access but by lifting the dial up after it pops up you can use manual to use all of them! Now you're going to wake up!"in a moment in the outside world Akihisa woke's stone body broke revealing the alicorn anthro under the human stone form as he got up in his outfit but with a foundation logo on his jacket.be then watched celestia's pony statue brake apart revealing the anthro woman he had come ot call mom after thousands of years under it in her mental realm outfit.she stretched standing with help form her heels, "Dam it!" she looked around at a large green jungle, " how long were we out!"Akihsia was about to speak but what looked like Timberwolves in a moment Celestia fired on them but they seemed to eat magic her eyes widened so Akihisa looked at that omnitrix as it called out, "starting up quick change between starting ten NRG!"In a moment Akihisa took on the form of omnitrix nrg and out of reflex fired off a radiation blast at it, eating it seem to make one member of the pack sick as he said, "…. I think I am a walking nuke!"next it changed his form to fourarms the omniverse versionas it said, "TRANSFORMATION FOURARMS!" in a moment he picked up a rock to throw at one knocking it apart.Celestia used her magic to scatter the parts before it reformed, next the omnitrix called out, "XLR8!" making Akihisa change again. The version of xlr8 he looked like, was omniverse as he used speed to avoid an attack and stand by his mom, "I feel so fucking weird yet still like me! does that make sense?"the thing then said, "DIAMONDHEAD!" and Akihsia turned into the reboot version of diamondhead out of reflex he fired off crystal shards at a timberwolf they hit and made it limp away.Celestia was pocking up a stick that was shaped like a staff and using it to knock another one away, "At this point anything makes sense!"another member of the back brought it's paw down and it would have hit Akihsia but the thing said, "BIG CHILL!" and in a moment he was the alien force version and he phased through the paw and breath ice freezing it. " …. I kind of feel like Eating a bolt cutter!"next the thing said, "GOOP!" And he became the reboot version of the slime as he said, "…. Ok Ick!" the next pack member clawed at him only for the paw to melt in the slime as it was digested Goop then fired off an acid ball at it's face, "I tasted that! Better then Himeji's cooking!"the omnitrix then said, "CANNONBOLT!" as he became the reboot version of the alien and rolled in to a ball and charged bouncing off and knocking down more of the pack as he said, "THE PIN BALL HAS A HORRIBLE LIFE!"he then stopped as it said, "WATERHAZARD!" he said turning into the ultimate alien version and he fired off a water jet out of instinct at one knocking it away, "BAD DOG!... I can do better sorry!"Celestia ducked and looked up to see the sun form soul eater, " the fuck?"next the omnitrix said, "terraspin!" changing akihsia into the ultimate alien version his air jets fired out blowing a shattered one's parts away leaving just one and the watch said, "armadrillo!" in a moment he became the omnivere version and his drill fist span as he shredded the last one into tooth pick.he then timed out and he felt himself," yeah everything is normal! Well that was something!"Celestia then stopped as her ear twitched as what looked like a jeep with humans in military gear colored in black with guns as Luna in a business suit black ,black skirt black high heels and sunglass got out and she smiled, "Big sister?" she asked adjusting her black tie.In a moment the sisters hugged Luna matched her sister in figure as Akihisa asked, "… Aunt luna?" at that point Luna looked at him then to Celestia and said, "…. Story checks out. anyway please get in the jeep it's a long away the dream man told us about you and Right now nephew we need help your help!"they got in and were soon in a war room.on a screen was Vilgax no armor just pants boots with two light sabers in red, "this is Vilgax the sith lord. We tried to revive as many people a simple acid can melt the stone but the revived at least here become anthro ponies. He found an alien ship with a human and he has been using the tech and what he learned to rule this area. His learned ability to move things with his mind and throw lighting is dangerous but Big chill has no mass to manipulate!"Akihsia crossed his arms, "So you want me to turn into the ice bug to beat up an alien war lord?"Luna sighed, "he is holding captive the power ponies and a zony girl named Yuuko and a few other people form this school called fumizuki with you attented.akihsia got up, "MY FRIENDS ARE THEIR! OK BRING IT ON!" he said cracking his knuckles.The aunt point up at a screen showing the soul eater moon, "it's late get rest maybe look at manual mode to set up play list of forms so you can find them quicker Akihisa we need prep time you just got that thing you need to learn all you can I mean the scp foundation is only armed by copies of this organic gun that shoots teeth!" he and Celestia nodded.to be continued.quick access list.NRG(1), fourarms(1), diamond head(1), xlr8l(1) big chill(1), goop(1), Cannonbolt (1), Waterhazard(1) Terraspin(1), armadrillo(1)manual listnone yet.

She said charging only to be knocked away by a force push letting Akihsia strike his back with his ice mace making the warlord bleed.Yuuko charged going in for a staff strike only to be force choked but she was soon set free by Akihisa breathing ice at Vilgax's left side making him scream in shock.Trot went to fire off a magic beam of energy only for Vilgax to hold out his light saber to deflect it but while he did that Akihisa's ice mash smashed through the frozen side making the warlords left arm shatter like glass.Marey screamed in pain roaring as his eyes glow yellow and he charged slashing like a mad beast.

The hero then phased through another light saber slash, "you are just got getting it are you!?"Mare-velous dropped her stone sword and picked up one of those red energy blades and turned it on " Taking this!" she said using it to hold back Vilgax's own slash. "thank you!"Zapp was in the air calling down lighting now while Vilgax waved a hand making it fly back at her she avoid and Akihisa ran his ice saber through his head form behind.Akihsia then timed out into his alicorn self and adjusted his jacket as the warlord dropped dead, " and he is gone only one thing left to do!"while Marey was running around freeing the slaves most of with where now the anthro people of the human version of Canterlot city all dressed in Grey rage one piece simple and easy to mass make, Akihsia kicked Wilgax's dead body in to the crowd many where laughing and kicking at the corpse happily.Unknown to them in another part of the massive jungle continent they were on, someone was watching he looked human he looked like Jaune arc but with paler greier skin, darker more orange hair golden eyes shining with rage and hate. He was dressed like his volume seven self but the armor was grey the trim red he had his weapon in sword sword mode. The colors also altered to fit it the pummel and handle also red, " Well be steal my force infused sword!"At with point the anthro version of spoiled rich dressed nice in a simple white dress and sandals walked in, "What is it papa?"Jaune smiled as he laughed looking at a crystal ball, "that idiot Vilgax finally got himself killed!

He was a fool who thought he could get by on half his listens if it was for the fact we were both taught by lord Vader I would have done it my self!"form a holocron a ghostly image of darth Vader appeared and said, "I respect that allow! Now what are you going to do my true apprentice!"Jaune held his chin, he was watching Akihisa as goop making the acid need to revive people in mass, " he can create the acid need to revive as all I want is to perfect that and experiment with that I shall strike a truce!

After all unlike the squid Jaune was a believer in the slacker ant state of mind. Doing the minimum to get what you want in a large group. Numbers were safe easy made work quick. Not that he couldn't take over like Vilgax did, it was just pointless as he would have to lead instead of fight slaughter and preform his dark side experiments, with chimera creation and raising the dead.On the monitor the seven power ponies each took turns kissing him showing they want Akihisa to be their shared stallion and Jaune said, "Sharing is instinct for an female equine anthro doesn't matter what they where before and they are warriors so make ssense.to be continued.quick access list.NRG(1), fourarms(1), diamond head(1), xlr8l(1) big chill(2), goop(1), Cannonbolt (1), Waterhazard(1) Terraspin(1), armadrillo(1)manual listGoop(1)

And I've been running the Scp foundation remnants in place of dead husband for the last fifty years!"the white one covered her mouth, "you're a widow I didn't know!?"the night princess said, "it's ok he took 682 with him!" she then walked along, "Now as for game plan when your son is done as they are clock work machines and the angle of the tank with I have the files on!" she said pulling them out form inside her suit top and said, "it comes form the other said of that volcano so I have a theory I would like to test with you!"Later on in the air by the smoke Celestia sniffed, "this isn't smoke it's steam!" Luna nodded as she flapped her wings knocking it away to reveal the volcano it was uppose to becoming form was a Plateau a flat topped mountain.the white one gasped, "so it was a trick logically there is a steam punk city on the other city run by this mechanoids?" she asked stunned.Luna smiled as she nodded lowering her sun glasses, "yes my husband he was so happy when the clockwork virus was destroyed by magic… yet part of it still remains…. They most all die for my husband sake in the afterlife!"the white alicorn blinked, "they aren't friendly so I most agree But what are we going to do they are living machines the best we have are organic guns that fire teeth!"Luna sighed and said, "their sister you forget what your son is! He does test in the foundation and we have translated the alien status of his watch to English and now have on file one hundred of his manual mode alien list. I can name five off the top of my head that can help!"later on the steam punk copper city was quickly turned black with purple circuit lines ben had become the reboot version of upgrades spreading through the city and with it all inside of it like a virus.before long the upgrade machine men was first to self-terminate as Akihisa's voice said, "sorry I have to do this guys but you aren't going to play nice so to protect mine I have to neutralize you all to protect my people!"before long the city was empty of life a ghost town as Akihisa demerged into upgrades before timing out and kicking the ground, "…. This sucks I am pretty sure I heard yuji's voice screaming no man don't make me kill myself!" he said sadly before looking through the manual mode and turning into the omniverse version of Jury-rig working on the city to adjust it for organic people!Elsewhere one of the mechanoids was running screaming in yuji's voice," AKIHISA HAS BECOME A MONSTER AT WORLDS END AND I THOUGHT BENG A ROBOT WAS BAD!"he was with another group of mechanoids when Jaune walked out hand on his sword blade as his other hand closed crushing most of the other clockwork men in to copper cubes.yuji screamed one could still tell who he was as his copper and glass face with leather hair still looked like him he point with his clawed hand and said, "don't kill me bro I want to live!"Jaune looked at him, "this isn't life or unlife! It's mobile stone cage you never returned! You are just moving around while trapped! That is interesting to me! I knew the foundation's actions and I've slaughtered thousand of yours to understand your organic machine nature and captured more as test subjects noun survived but you will be different or just another corpse for dissection!"he said drawing his sword in sword sword mode as he pulled yuji closer to slash his left arm and legs off as he laughed, "you won't be need it or this!" he then slashed the head off making the still living head scream.Jaune carried it, "time to get twisted metal man!" he said happily as he went to what looked like a make up lab in a cave with a human skeleton and piles of bone, "this will either unmecha form you partially or kill you doesn't matter to me!"Medusa walked out wearing a nurse hat as she said, " Ready to operate doctor! Let's dismantle and place the metal on the bones while I gather up the donation flesh form those monkeys and lizards!"Yuuji screamed as Jaune drew the blade in his sheave while drew lines on his head, "it's time!"Later on Yuuji was running he was in a humanoid body with green scale just a lion cloth his steam metal legs still their form the knee down he still had his robotic arms one a clap one a normal hand. His scaled head's top and left eye was still robotic copper with lens eye. It was the only eye he could see through and he ran through the scp foundation camp.As medusa ran out, "HE'S TREATMENT ISN'T OVER!"Luna grabbed yuji and looked at him, "Jaune found a cure? Or at least made a temp one! This could have saved my brother in law! Well it's too late and pointless as the virus can't spread so I guess have fun!" She said throwing him back to the witchvector arrows covered yuji as she smiled and said, "Will do come alone Yuji we need to see if rejection will happen!"Meanwhile Akihisa was four arms punching at a large steam punk tank, "A CURE HE COULD CURE IT WE COULD HAVE RETURNED HUMANITY TO THEM! I MADE MILLIONS KILL THEMSELVES FOR NO REASON!"Luna then walked up and spoke up, "you saw Yuji's reaction he wanted to run away form the cure! They won't have wanted it they didn't want to be organic again they would have looked at us as enemies still it wasn't for nothing yuji will probably end his own life when he is cured by Jaune and it was unavoidable and a lot of work for nothing you did the right thing nephew."next day Yuji was looking at a completely human corpse of yuji's with a throat slash him holding a stone knife covered in blood, "She was right it was pointless!" he said letting go of guild over genocide he commited the other day and going back home.unknown to him Jaune walked out, "And make it look like you killed yourself worked, I know I can remove and added organic steel to and from someone all I want I can make cyborgs or techno beast that can think for themselves now with your copper brains thanks Yuji!" he said tapping the corpses head with his hand affectionately, " you were a great help and friend man going to miss you! Now I am off to make my daughter a nice doll out of the leather that was your internal organs for a gift! Thanks man you the best!" he said getting up and leaving.Later on tiara was hugging an old time plush doll that looked cute happily, "thanks dad!" jaune petted her head, "don't thank me it's a parting gift form yuji! He was thankful for being restored but couldn't handle what he did as a machine so he made this then went to go end it all! But I told him you would love it!" he said happily.Jaune then walked off to a room filled with revived missing parts, " Ok now I can put the mechonoids parts on you guys just like I did for the rainbooms legs in one line eyes in another arms in the third line and only one eye per person sense they are made of glass they were the hardest to salvage!"to be continued.quick access list.NRG(2), fourarms(3), diamond head(2), xlr8l(2) big chill(2), goop(2), Cannonbolt (2), Waterhazard(2) Terraspin(2), armadrillo(2)manual listbrainstorm (1) upgrades.

    Out in the forest Miharu was holding Hazuki's club form swinging it to fire off energy shots knocking away patch work monster that could only be called in the shape of crabs.but they stopped one crab was using a pair of stone legs as a pincer and it was swinging it at them as Hazuki said, "I want to kill it! but how we smash with out braking that sun of a gun's legs?"Miharu blinked in confusion just using Hazuki to block the strikes as she said, "No idea!"Jaune then walked up closed his hand crushing every part of the grab that wasn't stone parts into a pile of slime as he said, "that's how!" he then continued walking hand on his sword handle.He soon came to the clockwork steam city being altered for living things as he came to Luna waving his hand making her go into a trance like state, "Hi luna as you know something knocks back anything with wings when they go to fly to far away but I found it doesn't happen with machines or boats and I see you now have zeppelins I would very much like to take one and head out exploring!"Luna nodded as she said," you can have a zeppelin Jaune arc it's the least we can do for all the revival help you give! "she then shock her head snapping out of it, "… did you just hypnotize me?" but he was already gone and she rolled her eyes, "Don't trust wizards kids!"that is when Akihisa walked up and asked, "yo Aunt luna what you wanted more cross tests or something!?"Luna sighed, "No as you know I've been getting cryptically noted gifts whatever is leaving them wants me to meet them!"Akihisa held up a hand and went into the manual list to pick ghostfreak turning into the omniverse version, "Ok I am unseen backup Got it!" he then vanished.Luna then headed off into a cave she had her horn lighting up the area as she noticed carvings matching standard scp foundation coded messages carved pictures and statues of her but the message were getting more and more maddened.That is when she saw it and she gasped backing away in shock. Their it was lit by a fire was a humanoid version of six eight two. Lizard skull head green scaled body visible rips wings now standing on two legs his front paws now massively clawed hand. He was dressed in a lion cloth.it's eight eyes looked at her as it groaned out in a voice that haunted her," Luna!"Luna gasped her sunglasses falling off, "you merged with 682!"the beast nodded as he said, "and I am losing my mind! The beast is returning!"Akihisa appeared his watch saying, "unstable DNA deteched should firing repair beam!" it then fired off a ray that made the merged monster roar as it was trying to split the fusions two halves apart a screaming human skull forming form the neck to yell, "NO IT'S THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME ALIVE!"In a moment it charged slashing forcing akihsia to jump ending the beam, "ok that was new!" the fusion returned to it's other state as he turned into armadrillo. Where he landed a piston powered left hook knocking back the monster that was technically his uncle to Luna's horror.the creature laughed happily, "that's it I wanted to die and take this lizard with me! come at me nephew!" it said charging on all fours as Akihsia went in to drill fist mode, to strike the beast but his drills did nothing on it making the monster slap him away.Akihisa hit the dial to become goop, "Ok time to do this ant style! " he then melted and dove down his uncles throat making the monster gasp as it hissed as goop said, "I MELT YOUR KIDNEY I MELT IT!"the beast fell over in pain screaming as Akihisa said, "fuck uncle it's regenerating faster then I can melt going to need to do this the gross way! Hold on I can use manual while transformed.in a moment the scp human hybrid screamed as he inflated like a balloon the crying Luna looking away In horror before Humungousaur the reboot version dressed in lion cloth armored left arm with spikes and gauntlet shoulder plat and leather strap across the chest holding the dial explode out of him turning the lizard human fusion into slime all over the walls.Luna was in an energy bubble jaw dropped as her mouth dropped at this as Akihisa said, "I got the idea form the manga naruto! But he used clones…. Oh I could have did that too… darn!"The alicorn of the night picked up her sunglasses and dropped the shield as she said, "…. Ok but what if the original six eight two reforms form this slime or each part of the slime turns back into a new one! It could be the end of our real life game of civilization!"In a moment Akihisa timed up and the omnitrix glow yellow sucking in all the slime as it said, "DNA collecting!" In a moment all the slime was sucked inside and the manual list hologram screen showed up with 682 now added. In a moment he tapped it and turned into the lizard.Luna jumped but Akihisa looked himself over and said, "I feel gross but still me! Also kind of like cuddling with a black eyed child! Having a staring contest with something that will snap my neck if I look away, and talking to a computer virus!"the princess held her chin, "yeah that's it's memories bleeding into your head! This changes so fucking much! If it can absorb Bio mass to gain new transformations we could fight fire with fire on all the scps!" she happily. Akihsia timed out and Luna hugged him, 'This is something your uncle would have loved he is surely thankful for the mercy kill now come on let's head out!"Later on Jaune was looking down form the zeppelin winder he saw an island one half was artic waste land the other half red waste land of sand.he used a telescope to look down there was a lake formed by ocean water flowing in between the gap. He saw a lab under it turned to stone and what looked like humanoid bugs fighting people and Faunus but the bugs seemed to have merged themselves with other animalshe held his chin as he said, "I need a closer look!"daring do who was driving said," easier said than down the winds are keeping us up high like it doesn't want us to land!"Jaune then opened a door and walked out hovering in air before lowering himself down on to the red side of the planet.the archer fish Terra former then tried to shoot him with water but he side stepped it drew his blade and in a moment he slashed and the shock wave cut the thing in half in the middle but it left one gross organ intact that was between the sides and he walked over touching it making it and him glow, "now that I removed the brain let's see how you do this!"he smiled as what he read, "yes that is how you mix and match other creatures thank you Terra former!" he then looked up and used the force to pull down the airship allowing it to anchor as daring Do stared eyed widened.Jaune then spoke up, "Now make sure the others are ready for a fight I see a flash turned to stone lab below and a statue I am going to go get it's information!" he said jumping into the water bending it so there was a tunnel of air always around and above him as he came to the statue of a man and drug it out with him.to be continued.quick access list.NRG(2), fourarms(3), diamond head(2), xlr8l(2) big chill(2), goop(3), Cannonbolt (2), Waterhazard(2) Terraspin(2), armadrillo(3)manual listbrainstorm (1) upgrades.

He made me a living weapon how could I not nora?"Nora nodded stunned as she charged off slashing the bugs apart.Meanwhile back on the lush jungle of the Green.Akihsia was walking with Yuuko, "I mean the creepy thing about this knocked out cold guardian is it kind of looks like Atomix that's this transformation I have but only used to compare pretty much just color scheme!"Yuuko then nodded as she shouldered her staff, "yes but I would rather you focus on me instead of duty and learning new things for the time being stallion!" she said giving a flirty wink.Akihsia jumped bright red.Later on while at the pit Akihsia was sitting with Trot summers formerly known as masked matter horn, " I honestly don't know if I can handle this weight form you girls the world around me the foundation!"the pink mare grabbed him and kissed him deeply making his wings pop as she broke it and said, "you need to stop stressing the world already ended multiple times just focus on rebuilding it."when that one on one time meeting was over Akihsia was atomix using it to block Mare-velous light saber strikes she had a few on her build currently using two as she said, "Stone sword did not last long did it marefriend?"the Filizon used two to slash at her boyfriend but she couldn't brake it, "no it didn't as it wasn't powerful enough!

I guess that's why I joined your herd! I love it!" she said going in for a drop kick only for Akihsia to become Cannonbolt and roll in to shell so when she kicked she jumped back holding her leg hopping around screaming, "MEANIE MEANIE MEANIE! STILL LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU BUT YOU'RE A MEANIE!"Akihisa unrolled and rolled his eyes, "you said anything goes not my fault I can change form!"up next the last power ponies Aurora.he was on a mountain looking out as he said, "And as we don't have enough hours on the day Tomorrow is the rainbooms date time with me! so what do you want to do weather princess."the white mare pinned Akihisa to a stone wall and kissed him deeply.Laterakihisa was fixing his air in a river when he spotted Miharu and said, "Not giving you pointers Miharu!" he said turning.Miharu rolled her eyes and shouldered hazuki's club form, "Not about that but also mad respect while on it warrior prince! But I am here mainly as Kubo needs a hand all the fire wood is wet and he needs his light his furnace to metal work."Akihsia pulled the dial up revealing the manual setting and hit wildvine turning into the original series version he spawned form his back massive wooden logs, "dry fire wood there!" he then timed himself out as the earth pony mare grabbed them and said, "thank you!"Hazuki then asked, "Can we go smash some rocks or something doesn't he need to melt stone to make metal!"her meister then said, "one task at a time Hazuki deliver wood then smash rocks to make metal by melting!"Later on in the alien ship Akihsia as jury-rig was timing out as he said," there is connect to our budding power grid powering it just like the water wheel and other things." He said with a smile.as a ghostly image popped up of dark Vader, "such power trusted upon you it is a burden isn't it! I know such burdens but do not let others tell you how you should use your power it's your power it's use it's your choice! And if others don't like it their say so has no matter!" he said pointing.Akihsia held his chin looking at the watch as he said, "you know your making a point! I really want to rebuild civilization but I am feeling like I am being tore between all the things I want to do!... I know I'll make a weekly rotation of what I do or help out with! So I don't have this pressure! Thanks ghost man! I am just guesting your Jaune and Vilgax's teacher?"Vader nodded as the alicorn anthro turned and said," well you're a wise man or ghost I'll give you that!

I guess that's why they are more lifelike Wait the chip here reveals a stone face they are bones and statues!"Marble used her mace to smash the last Golems chest joint making it snap in half it's top half falling into a pit, "now this is a problem I have using people and ponies to make living rocks isn't right!"Akihisa sighed and said, "they aren't alive! If they are made from destroyed statues and bones, they are technically speaking undead powered by the souls of those used to make them screaming to be set free!" he said pointing the omnitrix to one of the smashed parts and turning on the hologram screen to show energy mouthing thank you escaping them. " Self-aware to know what has happened but unable to act!" he said with rage.The rock farmer siblings growled holding their weapons Maud yelled out, "I love rocks I don't want to be one!" Limestone growled, "I WILL SHOVE MY PICK AXE INSIDE THEIR SKULL!"Marble climbed down the pit to finish smashing the one she split in half, "I'll be right back going to go let this guys rest in peace. "Akihisa held his chin as he said, "this is sick at first I thought they where made by studying the one in the scp file but this goes beyond that!" he said as they to a stream next following the golem foot steps to find destroyed ones.he also noticed human foot prints, "Ok human foot prints can't be a revival form here we're still in the magic melt who ever it was would have revived as an anthro here! Well most of the foundation are human but they are decedents form ones who were saved form turning to stone under ground and look at the marks there is a clear sigh of a fight and who ever it was being injured and they lead to that cave!"Marble gasped as she looked in, "he's right human lady holding cut on her side up in here!" Akihsia ran in to see the blonde woman with primitive glasses in primitive made white bikini. She was as hot as the pie sisters figure wise but he had no time for that she was knocked out.he got down looking through his manual listings " heat blast time!" he then transformed, into the omniverse version of the alien quickly running a finger over the slash on her abs burning the wound closed, "that'll stop the bleeding! Why most the lighting Aliens all be in manual!"he timed out and quickly used the manual settings to become brainstorm where he gave the woman a shock waking her up as he timed out and he and the girls stopped her form getting up, "Don't move the wound was just burned closed lady."the blonde adjusted her goggles and said, "I am Michelle you all?"After a round of introductions and explaining Akihisa was upgrades looking at her, "you said you managed to take down a few golems with out your powers and you need a drug to use them let's fix that shall we!" he said using his eye to scan her.he then morphed his hand and used it to brant into the wave wall a list before timing out, "Give me a minute to do two manual changes Ms!" he was then Wildvine, who grow a lot of planets, "the scan showed the drug you need to turn on your ant DNA is all natural all plants!"he then removed the planets and timed out, "Ok back to brainstorm to write down instructions!" he then did that and once he wrote the instructions on the wall by clawing them in he said, "now diamond head to make using crystal tools!"he then transformed again to Michelle's shock as all she was seeing was the most transformations ever all she could think about was if he was fighting terra formars. As diamond head worked and grinded them he said, "won't be as fast acting as an injection as this is a digestible but it'll do!"Maud pulled out a cloth and used it to tie a bag out of it to hold the grind up plant matter rolled into balls.Michelle took one and right away her antenna popped up as he race changed she felt more coming but right now it was just her stomach wound healing by way of regeneration. Her arms form the elbow down became armor plated as did her legs form the knee down. She also gained platting on her shoulders and that was it, "Also not as complete but it works!"She said getting ready as more of the Golems showed up and the group of five charged.Limestone said, "Sense this Bug lady crashed the date think she'll join and be girl Eightteen of the princes harem?" She said fighting golems.Maud just slashed one in half down the middle as she said, "she should he saved her life and gave her back her super powers!"Marble nodded as she said, "truly shoot!" she then went to attack but her weapon bounced off this golems had magic enhancements.so Akihsia turned to big chill and breathed ice freezing them with made them shatter, "enchanced against Melee attacks that's new I think we are being watched and our golem smith is upgrading them as he or she needs to by watching!"one of the golem heads spoke up, "correct!" the voice was male and as it turned to sand to reveal a gem " yes that scp Golem was informative but combat testing is better the lady and you have upgrade me completely soon my master work Kaboo will be finished!"with that said Akihsia turned back to Daimondhead and quickly used his powers to make a pare of gauntlets with a handle for grabbing and knuckle covering with spikes as he handed them to Michelle " that this they are made of diamonds not high tech but still should be power to hit with!"Michhelle took them as she tied the bag of the bug drug to her waist band blushing at Akihisa's power she was a fighter so she would be attracted to one and her bug side had her screening she found the king to start a large hive with.

" he said as he held up a golden band with blue gems "COME WORTH KABOO!"In a moment the massive Golem looking humanoid with square feet ball joints with pawn like formed parts and a head that had to side fins with eight gems on it for eyes. It was big and it held out it's left fist shooting it out!"Maud slashed using her sword to hold it back as she said," THIS THING IS MASSIVE YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR THIS!" She then jumped out of the way to her right as the fist returned to it's owner.the golem did it again with it's other hand As Marble and Limestone held this one back form Akihsia as he searched through the manual list," I have something for this Waybig In a moment Michelle and Maud joined the struggle allowing them to shatter that fist.the unicorn gasped as his giants rocket punch was not only held back twice but one was broken, "I made this thing to counter anything you sub creatures could throw at us pure bloods!"In a moment his eyes widened as akihsia hit the dial becoming the original series version of Waybig matching his Golem in size.Kaboom went in for a punch with it's one hand only for Akihsia to hold his arms out blade out blocking it and slashing the hand apart.the Golem jumped down as the owner said, "It's not possible! It's not!" Waybig then landed a left hook to Kaboom's round chest leaving a fist hole in it!the beast of Stone backed away in shock it's eyes firing off beams only for Waybig to cross his arms and fire off his green cosmic ray over taking the blast and destroying the head.the golem fell over. The man simple held out his bracelet making new stone come and repair Kaboom, "SO WHAT YOU CAN BRAKE IT I CAN FIX IT ALL I WANT IT WON'T TIRE BUT YOU WILL!"The restored Kaboom was up as Akihsia growled," I hate this kind of boss! Ladies get the stallions bracelet he is the target! This thing is just a hazard!" he said charging in to trade punches with the stone giant.Maud nodded and took off with her sisters and Michelle as she said, "blondie welcome to the harem!"Marble come down with her mace as Limestone came out with her two weapons the unicorn using his magic to knock them away only for him to step to avoid Maud's sword slash allowing Michelle to punch the unicorn's arm the one with the band.She smirked before her chemical punch made his arm explode making him scream in pain! The blast destroying the band making Kaboom shake and short out with magical energy.Akihsia smirked as he used a left hook to shatter the head making it fall down and this time it would stay down as he timed out and flow up to him, "so pure bloods I take it you people have never been stone then?" he said using the omnitrix to scan him, "why yes I'm right! Well now that was an impressive Golem clearly made form the scp's remains but nicely upgrade but sadly your in the way!"Michelle returned to her human form as she watched Akihsia become brainstorm ready to rip the knowledge out of the enemy's head.Meanwhile in the main village the anthro nurse red heart and doctor Caramel where in nice hospital outfits given to them by the foundation, in a new hospital room build out of the crashed alien ship.he smiled ready to start his job again. " Bless the prince!"Luna was leaving," Now we have a road connect this place to the steam punk city now to get the one area the revived stay human in revived for human town sense we don't like transporting statues more the new have to."Celestia walked up with her staff, "then exploring as Akihsia called in ocean travel is flawless and he now has eighteen women in his harem….

    On the red and the white Jaune was walking in to a cave with was the Atlas Camp a few heads turned mostly at Pyrrha who was waving, "hello?"at with point Cardin fainted as Jaune said, "yeah yeah necromancer brought the dead back to life big fucking deal! Now if you don't mind I want to speak to you're leader!" he said snapping his fingers making a golem out of bones and rock form around him and roar," or I could just kill everyone and raise them form the grave murder is not a lost for someone like me!"Nora point to him and said, "he's insane stand with him or be the mindless kind of zombie not the you still got a soul kind like these bitches! No offense bitches!"Spoiled summoned her sword, "None taken we are bitches! just try not to curse in front of Tiara!"Iron wood walked out dressed in primitive artic wear unlike most of the camp he was looking at Jaune as a savior he had power to bring about an endless army , clearly weapons and tech form his armor and the fact Nora was no wielding a metal sledge hammer with what looked like a jet on the end. " James ironwood Mr arc! Ms. Nikos nice to see you back on your feet if it were"Pyrrha then rolled her eyes, " they're not my feet!"James coughed "anyway Mr Arc you come here with advanced weapons resurrect team rwby with more animal traits then a Faunus!" at with point he ducked to avoid a stream of techno colored yellow fire.yang had smoke coming form her mouth, "Sorry still getting use to the fire breath!" she said covering it.James smiled and he said, "I see now upon revival you weaponized the new bodies you gave them interesting biological living weapons that fight for themselves I am impressed if things were normal you would have replaced everything Atlas had in weapon production!"Jaune had his hand on his sword as he said, "No one likes an ass kisser Jim! Come on out and say it!"ironwood put his hands behind his back as he said, "Fine then it was a under I was able to be revived with how much metal I had! And here we are in a war with blasted insects!"Nora held up a hand and said, "yeah don't got to worry about that Jaune resurrect their dead as an unliving army and sent them to go kill their friends and family So they are currently in the middle of a genocide carried out by the faces of their loved ones!"James turned to Jaune and said," normally I would call that insane but ms Nikos is proof enough of your claims of necromancer Jaune! We can rebuild this land in to a new city! A new golden age for humanity!"Jaune rolled his golden eyes as he said, "here is the thing with that Jim even before the world ended we had more then humans on the planet and the only human with me is Nora and I guess myself If I still count after all the enchantments I gave myself!" he said making a large bone like stinger come from the top of his left hand before retracting it, "I simple couldn't help myself! Surely you understand mr if it brakes cut it off and replace it with metal so I can fight again!"Iron wood held his chin and said, "why yes I do understand completely. And sorry for my phrasing!" he said looking to Tiara putting it together that Jaune fathered the child, "I have only had humans under my command for so long…."Jaune drew his blade and said, "Save the phrasing Jim I know what you want me to be your weapon maker but here is the thing You don't have anything to offer me for that to happen! The foundation on the Green have a magic library, stone revival potion and so many wonderous life forms to work with! After all a scale form their collection of scps is how I brought Yang back as a dragon of then there is my pet!"the undead dinosaur then roared into the inside a cave village making them all jump at the sight of the undead beast as Jaune said, "I did not raise it form the grave it was already undead and moving around man! I just had to grab hold of it's soul and bend it to my will to make it obey me!"James held his chin noticing the sword and how it appeared to be unnaturally sharp like the blade itself was unnatural, " you use this magic of yours in making your sword didn't you?"Jaune opened a portal and pulled out a copy of his unsheaved blade " yes but I made more then one!" he said throwing James the sword, " now Jim I am a reasonable man. You are clearly the war lord here the big boss! So I say we fight for the title! I win I'm the boss you win your still the boss and I'll revive seven of your solider like Team rwby here on honor of you doing the impossible!?"In a moment James swung his sword only for Jaune to block it with the back of his hand as white light sparked as Jaune said, "really dirty swings that's what we are doing ok then!" he then flicked a finger knocking Ironwood back with unseen force.Jaune held his sword, "I was going to be a sporty man and just use swordsman ship but sense we are fighting dirty might as well use my fell might!" he said forming and firing off balls of lighting through the dark side.James was running avoiding them as he said, "where did you learn this skills!" the Sith lord said, "Form a ghost!"In a moment James jumped to avoid a sword dropping Jaune was still holding his he was using that portal to drop blades.Ruby was about to go grab one but spoiled stopped her," No! if you grab one of his force forged blades he will cut the hand that grabbed them off!"she said just as Jaune slashed off iron woods hand making him drop the sword as Jaune grabbed the falling blade and stabbed jim right in the head through his Aura pinning him to the cave wall to the gathered people's horror, "Ok now he's dead and I'm your new war lord Everyone got that shit!"they all noddedJaune said," good now show me , my women, and my daughter around my new kingdom!" he said hand on his chest as he put up the blade and send away the copies, " but first let's not make waste!"he then looked to Jim's body and in a moment everything on the bones was removed with a snap of the fingers as the bones got up bowing be fore standing as jaune formed a stone spear and shield form it out of the ground along with some permeative armor " go join the line the undead Terra formars in the line they will form when they finish killing their friends and family!"those watching jumped back in horror at what they saw as their former leader ran off to do that, "Jaune see his much more pleasant now!"Meanwhile on the Green.Kubo was hammering metal as Miharu walked in shouldering Hazuki in weapon form, "hay Kubo we need more metal! The weapon formula doesn't mix if it's not made in metal drums! And they want it mixed with the revival potion for the budding human done! If the no mads are so raciest form was a different race they will be heading to human town so we are trap setting."Kubo nodded as he said, "And with Akihsia taking the week off to be with his harem we need it, and I guess the help form the harem girls not with him on those days sense there are to many to be with in one day at eight teen I always knew he was a man among men!

We are working on roads only problem is power we can power capital with the alien ship, the steam punk city has steam power but what about human town."A human Scp agent then showed up as he said, "I think I can help with that my lady it was common to turn old train engines into generators!

    Through the forest what looked like a train on tank tracks was rolling into a village to act as a generator.In this human town Village was eight woman. All dressed in simple Brown dress rope belts one of them named yomi had sumple glasses, next to here cheering happily was her friend tomo, Sasaki their other friend was petting a cat or trying to but it ran.Kagura sighed watching, "Some things never change!"Osaka held a hand up, "Say if we were stone brought to life does that make us wonder woman!"the little girl chiyo rolled her eyes, "I don't think so miss Osaka."an older woman named yukari turned into a shotgun before returning to normal and asking an Scp foundation something, "How come I am the only one it worked for?"her friend Nyamo rolled her eyes, "thousands of years later and your still immature the point is it worked and you are have super powers how about work on it to protect the students who are still looking for their families."the human foundation member fired his tooth shooting organic gun at a lion as he said, "I think you best listen to your friend this is nuts!"Elsewhere on the forest trail Miharu was holding Hazuki in club form before was what looked like a nuckelavee the things heads looked but it trotted off past them with out trying to strike them.Hazuki yelled, "HAY GET BACK HERE AND FIGHT US I WANT TO SMASH A SKULL IN ALREADY!"Miharu hit the weapon on the ground making Hazuki scream in pain, "SHUT UP IT LET US GO!"An anthro agent of the foundation came up, "That's three four five six it matches the nuckelavee it normal hunts humans but it leaves revived and anthros along. I can see revived as it probably things of them as golems it's why so many of the natural born humans in our underground city stay underground it can't appear there sense it's surrounded and with streams many running through it! there is no place for it to warp in safely! We had it marked as harmless for the most part thanks to this! But with human town coming… yeah! It'll be bad!"the anthro agent was a dark blue furred earth pony, "Look I know you don't swing that way so know when I ask you to join me it's just to hunt this thing down! I am agent three six five seven nine one zero! But just call me Zero!" he said holding a hand out.Miharu rolled her eyes, "most everything be numbered! With you guys!?" she asked before Hazuki yelled," WHO CARE LET'S HUNT!"Later on Miharu was knocking down plant matter, "What's the plant for this?"the agent point to his left hip to show a mask, "Zero three five is the plan! It's a cursed mask the thing regenerates so In theory the curse that makes a host rot won't happen and the spirit inside it will have a forever body! Killing two birds with one stone!"Miharu then swung Hazuki sending out an energy blast that hit the nuckelavee in the ass while it's horse head was drinking water.the torso turned roaring sending them sliding back as it's slasher claw hands stretched and the agent fired on the hands blasting the fingers off watching them grow back as he jumped back, "Ok Getting in range is going to be harder then I thought!"Miharu jumped and throw Hazuki the club glow hitting the human head in the jaw before turning and returning to her hand like a boomerang.Zero looked to her," you smart nag! He put the mask on the club," DO IT AGAIN NOW!"the earth pony anthro used that attack again while Hazuki laughed, "BOOMRANG SHOT UPSIDE THE HEAD!" As she hit dropping the mask on to the body of the scp.As she turned to her bat pony form flying. The monster twitched before a voice said, "My my this patch work thing is horrible!"Zero blinked before pulling out a note pad, "what do you mean by that?"the mask spirit said, "it's all human flesh made into this chape by mixing and matching it's why they hunted but this one is the last if it's brains are right. Don't worry it regenerates for years till the flesh rots and it falls apart I should be fine for a thousand years and no more of this guy so go ahead stamp his papers naturalized!"he then walked off saying, "Now I have things I want to go see! So I can only move legs or the arms not both well that's bullshit!"Zero smiled and said, "perfect mission complete Now I am off to ask this Kubo guy out! he looks like my kind of stallion!"Miharu nodded as Hazuki landed and they head off, "I honestly would do anything to spend a day with any woman in akihisa's harem I am almost tempted to join as girl nine teen just so I can be with them after all Akihisa is a nice guy got game if I was going to be a mother I would ask for his help any dam way! Not kubo! No offense he's just sterile I know when I brought that question up in high school about two gay friends working together to have a family. He was for it but couldn't."zero blinked and asked, "oh did he say why?"Hazuki then blinked and said, " I said thanks to cancer he was gelded whatever that means!"Meanwhile.mare-velous was using her energy blade to slash through a golem she was on a train protecting it form the pure bloods, "this shit has to end!"A golem spoke," it'll end when you beefy bitches lay down and die like you should have this world isn't for you!" the golem spoke for the millionth time it was a prerecorded message nothing more.She used her metal shield to block a hammer fist drop before charging forward and jumping slashing it's head with gem in it off, "is golems all you guys do?"In a moment an earth pony anthro with white fur a green mohawk green crystal sunglasses in green fabric pants lion skin boots green shirt lion skin coat brown leather gloves and on his back Six tentacle made of stone peace with claws connect to his stone belt," No we weaponized it octo is my name know it well for I am a doctor of golem weapons!"mare-velous point and got ready, "well bring it on doc ock!... that was horrible!" She said jumping to avoid a tendril smash. Where she slashed it off.Only for the remains to hold over the train and absorb more rock to rebuild it's self, "Pointless struggle!" he said trying to use all four to smash her only for her to throw her beam saber to slash his stone belt making his tendrils fall off.She then charged in shield bashing him off the train, "Well now we'll make a note of that!"to be continued.quick access list.NRG(2), fourarms(4), diamond head(5), xlr8l(3) big chill(3), goop(4), Cannonbolt (3), Waterhazard(2) Terraspin(2), armadrillo(4)manual listbrainstorm (4) upgrades(3) atomix(2) jury-rig ( 3 ) ghostfreak (1) Humungousaur (1) wildvine(3) heatblast (1) Waybig (1) 91 others at leastAdded to manual list682 (2)Omake.Akihisa for the first time and hours came out to see Miharu and he ask, "so Miharu what can I do for you"" to his shock Miharu grabbed him and kissed him before pushing him back.the orange haired lady said, "Do you know what you did pig?

Form regenerating whip like weapons like Ock used to Golems! Other things such as self repairing shields club, and hammers , armor and maces are also possible!"Trott nodded as she added, "it is also possible for them to use stone as replacement limps if his belt could make arm like tendrils so easily as our world is mostly stone now! This plus self-repairing armor will make it easy to hide with their muted Colors! Unlike us who stick out in the jungle!"the Alicorn nodded as she drank some water, "but this is where they fail we know they will target those different, we know they will target the humans, We know they use sneak attacks and golem foot soldiers! They are predictable and knowing this facts about them will help you adjust to counter whatever they throw at you!"the unicorn smiled as she said, "all their stone is controlled by a focus gem!

The Zony shouldering a shovel as she happily said, "come on time to dig!"Limestone rolled her eyes as she said, "this trees are treey!"Akihsia then turned to Armadrillo and started digging as he said, "yeah that's because till I burned it to death their was a living wooden horse that turned all it touched into trees!"At with point Limestone looked to see a face in a tree and backed away form it, "gee forest of corps digging in the dirt how fucking romantic!" she said using her pick axe to start digging.Yuuko smiled as she started shoveling as she said, "I can't believe that gold digger Nami throwing herself at you Akihsia I mean you turned her down but fuck was she stupid for trying!"At with point Zoro with Minami and himeji's statues showed up and Yuuko point to a bag of shovels, "drop the statues we'll take them back in the mean time grab some shovels and help us out!"the sword man then did as told and picked up three shovels holding them like his three swords as he started digging quickly as Limestone said," Remind me again what we are looking for?"Yuuko smiled as she held out a finger and said, "about time someone asked. Any how before akihisa woke up and we are all still Vilgax's slaves I watched for five nights as lights fell form above to this area Something landed here Something that could help and we need to find it!"In a moment Zoro said," found something!" As he throw a large peace of metal that was odd shaped up!Limestone hit something too and said," I found something too and it looks like the same kind of thing!"at with point Yuuko and Akihsia found the same, with end with Zorro finding a second one so five twist piece of metal.As our shape shifter returned to normal he said, "looks like a puzzle!" he said easily picking up and connecting two peace's and they seemed to fuse , " it is a puzzle!"Lime stone smiled as they got to work finishing the puzzle revealing a large rectangle metal block as zorro said," And what is this a monolith or something?"In a moment the solved puzzle spoke up, " yes it is! One question answered you have two left!"the swordsmen face palmed at it, "great it's an answer box and I just used it by mistake! Just like a genie!"Yuuko quickly covered Limestone and Akihsia's mouth, "shhh we have to ask vague questions to get the most information out of it! Akihsia turn into something smart!"Akihisa then went into the manual list and became grey matter as he held his chin, "I am small but very smart! The most vague thing is what has happened to get us to this point!?"the block spoke up, "the bad guy got bored and decide to copy locations with their people to make his own planet then turn everyone to stone to see what would happen, and the rest you know form living it and hearing it!"they all rolled their eyes as it said, "one question left!"Limestone had an eye twitch, "well that was a lot of nothing! I think it's programed to answer by saying as little as possible guys!"Zorro then spoke up, "As much as I hate to say it let's think what would Nami do! What does our world look like!"In a moment it became a map! They were at the top their was a few island and one continent that kind of looked like the letter M.Yuuko grabbed it and looked at it, "that is honestly the best it would probably do for us thanks Zorro,, oh wait his gone!"Akihsia was goop, "come on let's wake them up!" he said putting simple fabric dresses over both statues in a moment Minami was back looking like an older version of her sister but Flat screaming at them then at her.goop then said, "yeah welcome to the end of the world… now I have to revive the other one!" he then fired a shot of slime.Making the stone melt Himeji had a visible scar that ran form her left index finger to her arm over ber back on to the left index finger, she had white fur as a unicorn anthro her mane and tail pink, her eyes the same and she screamed, akihsia timed out as he said, "why does everyone scream when they reanimate form stone?"Limestone shrugged, "come on let's head back we found what we were looking for and got useful thing! You two can follow or stay here and die!"the two looked confused but they turned to walk behind the the group of three.later on.akihsia was Humungousaur using his mace tail to smash a golem apart it did not reform as he said, "Ok this golem forces project is not going to work they are easier than the ones I battled when the pure bloods were a thing!" he said just punching one making it shatter, " Let's focus on getting the ship build so we can start exploring and help the witches who so kindly asked for our help!"Celestia then walked up, "ok time out please I found something amazing!" Akihsia returned to normal and walked to his mother," what mom?"Celestia sighed for her son to watch as she lead him to a door in the middle of no where and opened it up to see a restraint inside as she said, "I found this last week the people within it says we are on earth right now as the doors lead here ever Saturday but you can't leave through any other way only out the door with sends you back to where you where before!"the master chief of the place walked out, "Oh it's you again lady so this is your son you are so proud of, Let me guess two tofu Stakes with grilled veggies?"the white alicorn nodded and he went to start cooking.Akihisa blinked and said," ok this is just fucking weird!time till the ship is finished Two weeks.to be continued.quick access list.NRG(2), fourarms(4), diamond head(7), xlr8l(3) big chill(3), goop(6), Cannonbolt (3), Waterhazard(2) Terraspin(2), armadrillo(6)manual listbrainstorm (4) upgrades(3) atomix(2) jury-rig ( 4 ) ghostfreak (2) Humungousaur (2) wildvine(3) heatblast (2) Waybig (1) Greymatter(1) 90 others at leastAdded to manual list682 (2)Omake.in the bar upstairs Akihsia was drinking talking to the bar keep who said, "you have ten different apple ciders I know where I am taking Rainbow this Saturday!"A lion man walked up and said," this seat taken?"

    In the stone world.Himeji was pointing at rainbow dash, "what makes you think you should be in his harem you metal faced bitch! Me and Minami knew akihisa way before he was the warrior prince at worlds end!"Minami was about to say something but Rainbow dash appeared behind her in a burst of speed and covered the bat pony's mouth with a bandage as she said, "Shut up you Nags! Why do I deserve to be in his harem I'll tell you both wise I say I love you instead of hurting him!"both ladies jumped as the blue mare said, "this isn't anime! Your Tsundere attitude loses you the guy you like dumbasses!"Pinkie pie walked by saying, "never go full Tsundere people never go full Tsundere! You can go fourth or even a half then your just a little bitchy with some guys like but never full! Never full if any guy likes full even seventy five precent can be ok if both parties Agree but never full never full!" she said holding a large peace of wood bigger then her.Elsewhere.Fluttershy was avoiding slash form glowing blades of Black light. Before her was a white furred purple mane, a purple tail bound in died black bandages. He was in died black fabric primitive pants.he growled, "I HATE MARES!" he scremed As his sword construct morphed into massive spiked clubs that Fluttershy was still avoiding he was an earth pony so his flight and black energy magic aura made no sense!In a moment a pink wall appeared between them as Green Gardener hovered over and said, "your fight is with me blacklight Green gardener formerly known as radiance!"the now named black light charged at her screaming as Green made a pink arm shield to block the strikes as she said, "I understand in a reverse gender role world we came form you lost everything because you were always passed up for as a mare, if not you would have probably been a hero! But the society you are taking your rage out on is gone!"black light growled as he traded his clubs for two lances and was stabbing Radiance blocking with now two shields "that's the thing it isn't! As long as mares born into it come back it is still around people wanting to bring it back! They may look to the prince but it's his mother and aunt that lead running this show!"Fluttershy then said, "THEN FLY TO THE RED AND WHITE JAUNE IS A MALE AND HE LEADS IT!" he yelled making him look where she used her stare and he was Frozen.Allowing Green to change to a katana construct and use it to cut off his head as she said," so sorry Black Light!" she cried as he fell down dead as Black energy flow off as she said, "….. it's all the fault of a culture that looks down on males… the amazons abuse Males it's way worst we have to stop it we have to help the witches!"Fluttershy looked at the Black energy as it hit her making her eyes turned Black like black light as she said," what just happened?" She said as she noticed her mane and tail turn red and her fur get a bit darker as well.Radiance rolled her eyes, "it's just the thing that gave him power he called it the darkness but it's just a bootleg version of my bracelets! It just merges in form one owner and then moves on to a new one normally the last pony the last owner thought of he was looking at you so makes sense."Fluttershy held her hand out making a black light staff she span it around making it go form staff to spear to Axe, to scythe before making it go away, "so I have the same powers as you now?"Green nodded and Fluttershy bowed and said, "then teach me Sensei! We need to use all we have to help the witches!"Later on at light.Around the cover of street lights Fluttershy was showing off her new powers to sunset by making a black like Chinese dragon that followed her left finger around making it fly in a mystifying partner as she smiled, "isn't it cool!"Sunset held her chin, "I guess it is!" she said touching the dragon, " it feels like real scales!" she said shocked!Fluttershy smiled as she make it go away, "all I know is I can grow to like this power and I think I look good as a red head!" she said adjusting her mane, " don't you my harem mate?"sunset jumped and blushed, "… did you just flirt with me?" she seemed shocked.Fluttershy giggled and said, "Well being in a harem as brought me out of my shell Sunset, and hate to brake it to you shimmer but harem is one big relationship if Akihisa is both of our boyfriends and we agree to it then we are girlfriends same thing with the other members!"Sunset blinked having not thought of that before, "oh ….. ok then…..wait does that make us spruce bitches?... because some how she is the current alpha female of the herd or harem or what ever?"the yellow mare walked off and said, "silly shimmer, the answer is yes we are spruce bitches!" she then bumped her rump against sunsets making the other mare jump.Shimmer was wide eyed as she said," …. And that was a thing that happened and wait is that a pool of blood SANJI YOU CREEP!" she said running off to hurt the cook!a few days later Frank was in human town on ending of work hours yelling, "this time next week it'll be done and we'll be setting sail everyone! I know my captain can't wait to be on the ocean again!"That is when what looked like a winged snake fly down holding a note in it's mouth and it put the note in Franky's big hand.the man looked at it, "too Celestia form Medusa oh air mail cool cool! I'll hand it off don't worry!" he said walking off as the snake followed and he looked at it, "you are suppose to bring the reply aren't you?" the snake nodded.Later on Franky gave it to Celestia and she opened it, "Oh the witch contacted Jaune and as it's so close he is already helping them he found that beside them is a graveyard of giants, but it turned out to be biomechs!"the ship building was about to ask Celestia then said, "that's artificial living giants someone can control as the brain is a robotic control room!"Franky held his chin and said, "Super creepy but impressive! So what the witches want to get one of those things running again and give it some new armor and weapons to crush the amazons in one go?"Celestia turned the note around and pulled out a pen to write, "yes but Jaune says he needs fresh Giant DNA my son's form way big can give it, he also wants organic armor he as Terror farmer DNA but he wants Diamondheads DNA to to make it so the new organic bug shell is crystalline and able to spawn weapons on will!"Franken nodded as he said," so your saying my reward for making this new ship is the watching of a super monster being made to smash some evil bitches…. SUPER!" he said doing his pose.zorro then walked by Nami had a rope tying their wrist together, "we should have thought of this long ago man!"Usopp walked by as he said, "great now no one will care about my farming or my recovery of those massive plant seeds! When that is in the works! Giant killer bio bug bot!"Celestia then spoke up as she gave the snake the letter to take back, "we'll help but there is the matter of the pilot the mechs are linked to one person and that's the one that can run it While the pilot is revived and one of the witches adopted kids he is horrified of the thing!

And if she can do it that well how is she a single mother?"applejack looked at her and said, "I know right at that level it was art! Look it does look like a normal modern city!" she said as they pulled in to port.Once off they were greeted by three people and a troop of uniformed officers. The woman leading had a figure and size matching Celestia an eye path over one eye, one red eye a fang filled smirk, a coat like medusa a little red dress with black heel boots fish net stockings and black sleeve gloves. " I Am Mabaa the head witch!" she said smiling as she flipped her hair.she then pointed to a teenage boy with red eyes brown hair in a black suit and tie, "to my right my adopted Son Max who has gotten my magic!"beside him was a pink haired teen version Blair in her dressoutfit and she waved, "I am Zoe adopted daughter of Blair the cat she was witch like enough to get it so she counts as one now!

But Mizune stopped them but was injuried her son Shinji was the only one who could Pilot the Eva we got working so he's over his fear of the robot now as he wants revenge!"Max nodded as he held out his hand making a spectral magic crystal ball to see the boy using his inherited magic to make a laser blade to slash apart dummies that were made to look like amazons. "he is ready but the biomech isn't!"Akihsia was already Xlr8 and he gave a kiss to all twenty of his harem before saying," I'll be back when it's time for launch, point me to where Jaune is!" Max pointed and in a moment he took off.before long in the graveyard of smashed stone giants Akihsia now diamondhead was standing before Evangelion unit-01.

I have out done myself!"that is when Max appeared stepping out of the black energy dome with Shinji as he said," I have brought the pilot!"Shinji nodded as he used magic to hover up to the plug and get in as soon as he was in the thing's breathable blood he took a breath and opened his eyes glowing red as he brought the thing to life sparking the Stwo engine with his own magic as it roared to full life struggling in it's chains.Shinji then growled out, "OBEY ME!" he said moving his arm up forcing the other arm to do the same but slowly and growled letting out a madness wave length that made the thing howl in pain.

A jungle village filled with women dressed as your stereotype amazons sounded by almost formless humanoids used as slave labor were going about their day talking about ending Men when the Eva appeared before them opening it's mouth and spitting off a ball of dark magic power that hit their center destroying and killing most in the first blast.the Eva landed as Shinji's spoke the beast repeating it," I am a man you hurt my mother and ruined thousands of lives giving them living death for that your wickedness most be wiped out form the face of this world of stone!"he said holding out it's arms to fire off crystal spikes massive ones destroying and killing more, the crystals then exploded into thousands of needles killing all who avoided the landing of the main body.Shinji continued stepping roaring and using this crystal spike shrapnel bomb move over and over before long the area was covered in floating red Kishin egg souls and crystals, and a few haunting pure souls of the things that use to be men but where now nothing but living shadows each one smiling happily at it's death.Shinji looked around roaring in victory making the beast roar arcing it's back. Evangelion lived again and it would be the witches weapons.A few days later Celestia was walking with luffy, "so instead of going the normal way home you want to go see that desert with floating mountains next to the giant graveyard then head down till we are back at the green to explore two more areas?"Luffy nodded and he said," yeah and sense my Crew are the ones who are driving and know how to drive you don't have a choice lady any how!"the princess sighed, "True true Very well can't fight it but I have to worry about it!" he said looking to the now magically chained Eva in the middle of the witch realm officially called the Black now.

    The neo Sunny was in the air over raging stand storms in a land of floating mountains and rocks being attacked by what looked like boats carved out of those floating stones with machines and canons hooked to them.Luffy throw a rubber punch hitting one. As Usopp was firing on them with the ship cannons with franky's help as he said, "cane this Crystal gatling guns back a punch!" he said hitting one of the air ships in the steering device leaving it floating.Jinbe was doing his best to keep the ship form getting form being hit as he said, "it's amazing! A whole realm in the air floating over sand storms I wonder why they haven't invaded other realms?"Fluttershy used a giant paddle construct to knock one away where it fell like a rock, "clearly they can't get to far form the sand storm below or they fall!"Akihsia hit the omnitrix becoming original series eyeguy as the transformation declared. As he fired off optic blast hitting them," also not the ones driving are pure blood zebra, batponies and unicorns with two horns one on top of the other making them bicorns!"Masked matter horn hit one in a freeze beam, "bit time! Jinbe how about trying to head into that floating mountain cave system for us to hide! They clearly want the sunny as it doesn't use stones to fly!"Jinbe nodded as he said, "I need cover for it! Nami can you make a smoke screen!"the navigator held her staff, "We lost the dails to time this is just a stick! I can't Wait! But I still know how to do it! Zapp I need a rain storm!"the Aurora did as told before the navigator smiled and said "Celestia heated dome shield!" the princess did as told and in a moment steam blinded the enemy.when it died down they sunny was gone.in a cave they were anchored Chopper was on the ground to overheated to move as he said," if anyone needs medical treated me Ask Akihisa to cool me off with big chill first!" he said before passing out.Robin flipped her hair and said," that was a dog fight! Dog fight means in the air! It's far more difficult than what we are use too!"Zoro jumped out and saw a whole in the button of the hall as he said, "yeah they can shot form below and above!" Akihsia jumped out hitting the dial to become jury-rig as he said, "Give me eight!" he said as he started fixing.Yuuko then looked over the side, "And I think you are all missing a big sight all of those ships had one of seven different symbols and where also shooting at eachother and use!"Luffy rubbed his nose as he said, "yeah your right I noticed with my Haki but I was more focused on making sure my ship and crew made it through!"Celestia spoke up after clearing her throat, "and seven floating mountains I think that means this realm doesn't have a warlord but seven waring for the title of warlord supreme!"Jinbe looked over the side and added to the conversation, "If Sanji would be awake and not still fainted form the royal harem's make overs he would probably point out this crew always gets involved with stuff like this and Luffy is going to want to end it!"Luffy thumbed up him as he said, "yeah just one problem, with of the Seven guys are is the lesser evil! I mean we can't just go in blind and take over the whole realm! I am an explore not a king!"Brook jumped over the side to stand on the cliff walk way as he said, "Now may not be the time but their appears to be carvings on the walls!" he touched it, "what is this picture systems?"Yuuko then looked at them and said, "Kanji Japanese kanji me Miharu and Akihisa's native langue!"Miharu jumped over and blinked, "Wait I just noticed we all have been speaking what we would call English this whole time I mean I can still speak Japanese if I want but I learned how to read write and speak another langue out of nowhere upon revival!"Twilight used magic to light up the cave as she said, "Ok then more mystery so how about you read the kanji for us!"the earth pony held her chin as she said, "wish I brough Hazuki but it says meeting or the warlords check ins Slave king checked in three times, male supreme king checked in four, lady supreme king check in five times. Zebra are domination king checked in six times, eight times the bats should rule the land of sky lord checked in, ten times the Bicorn queen was here, And finally the chief of Zebrica checked in five times! each is written differently so I would say the names were sighed by the fractions."Princess arrow head had hands on her hips, " That's bizarro they would come out and say it, but every three months I wake up a different pony type with is how I went form earth to unicorn so not like I have much say in weird. But Zebrica sounds like the least evil!"that is when they heard a knock and a mare said, "I come in peace, sorry May I enter the dome.. I wish to help!"in a moment they told her and Zecora walked in as she said," I am Zecora daughter of the current chief and seer?"applejack said," she is telling the truth!" she crossed her arms and Luffy looked up, "Seer means she sees the future at random times!"Luffy cheered, "that's awesome! So prove it what do you know!" he said eyes sparkling.the mare then went around pointing out their names and past adventures before finishing on Akihsia as she addressed him as, "future husband!"the prince timed out and the twenty mares already in the harem said, "Can't argue with the future welcome aboard Zecora!" they said all walking up and welcoming there new cowife with open arms.Zecora was head, "once every ten years the warlords meet! If you wait a day you all of them you can greet!"Zoro swung a sword around, "have them come to us kick all their asses and take their titles all at once sounds like a plan!"Michelle then spoke up, "hold on their everyone! If it would be that simple they would have done so before what are the catches!"Zecora sighed putting her hands on her hearts, "the challenge can only be done one on one now two may share the same title but one can give it! but the battles are to the death"Celestia then held her hand out, "so if zecora's father already is a warlord, then six of us have to fight and win by killing six warlords. One who is a slaver, three who are raciest, and two who are sexiest! Not going to be easy to feel guilty over them!"Luffy rubbed his arms," Well Me and Zorro can handle two, akihsia can handle one, Saddle rager and Michele looks like they can each handle one, leaving just one up for grabs… geee how about Fluttershy she can test her new powers."Brook then nodded, "Well I am out already dead they would win instantly if I stepped into the ring!"to be continued.quick access list.NRG(2), fourarms(4), diamond head(8), xlr8l(4) big chill(3), goop(6), Cannonbolt (3), Waterhazard(2) Terraspin(2), armadrillo(6)manual listbrainstorm (4) upgrades(3) atomix(2) jury-rig ( 5 ) ghostfreak (2) Humungousaur (2) wildvine(3) heatblast (2) Waybig (1) Greymatter(1) eyeguy(1) and 89others at leastAdded to manual list682 (2)Omake.Meanwhile back on the green.Yukari was laying out in the sand, "my shotgun ass is bored and lonely!"Nyamo walked over hands on her hip, "Lonely you have me!"the other teacher got up and said, "yes but we are currently looking to join a harem!

    On top of the mountain Fluttershy was in a challenge being mocked by a tribal bicorn form being a woman.In a moment she made one massive sword construct and cut his head off as Luffy said, "and so ends that one the last one Ok We appoint Zecora's dad as our rep I guess and we're done hre and the yellow is united…. Feels too easy!"Akihsia had his hands in his pocket, "yes but you forget we still need to repair the sunny!"Pinkie pie looked out, and whispered."a load of tribal people we stone tech against us did you think it would be a challenge? Now come on We have to ger Zecora her make off to show she's one of us!" she said taking her away with the other members of the royal harem with smirks.Zecora was red form the way they were looking at her as Sunset said," flutterbat or shy or whatever is right we are also in a relationship with eachother might as well have fun with it!" she then gave Zecora's neck a lick and she wasn't the only member of the harem to do so.the zebra mare jumped at it and gulped.Later on she now had the same gothic make up as the others in the Black bikini top black sideless skirt, but she had a rope belt around her waist, Black heel boots but she added her jewels around her neck, her ear rings, and bands around her wrist and bicepsshe was red as she hugged Akihisa happily who was red and said, "My Sister wives are very affectionate, it's not all great but I guess this is part of finding happiness as one of your wives, mister."akihisa smiled but in a moment he heard something and hit his dial becoming Goop as a throwing star made of stone hit him and melted and he turned and said, "Come out!"what came out was in lion cloth only a zebra stallion, "I CAN NOT ACCEPT ZECORA TO WED SOMEONE WITH OUT STRIPES I HAD MY EYES ON HER FOR TO LONG SHE IS MINE!" he said drawing a spear.the stallion then stabbed the ground making spikes come up in a moment Akihsia became Cannonbolt to grab and protect Zecora as he asked, "care to explain this!" he said rolling ahead.upon impact with the guy he was replaced with a log as Zecora said, "…. I thought he was a foalhood friend, but turns out he is a stalker skilled in the way of zebra Shinobi arts!"The mane jumped out but now there was ten of him only for Cannobolt to charge and hit one and bounce off him and hit the other ones making him explode in to smoke. " so earth manipulation cloning switching places and weapons are his thing!... I got something to handle that!" he said unrolling and hitting the dial becoming NRG.In a moment the light form his grate spread revealing a shadow of a stallion as five more of him jumped out with no shadows and he fired off a radiation blast hitting the guy where he hit making him fall out gasping as he held his radiation burned chest looking at akihisa as he stood there walking over to him.his eyes widened as he hit the ground only for the spikes to come up and hit NRG and brake upon his armor! He's eyes widened in horror as NRG grabbed him by the head and drug him and spoke up, "you realize you're an idiot right? Attacking an enemy who is a walking Army! You stupid too stupid to live and that is saying something coming to me, I was not the best student!" he said walking to the edge of the floating island and throwing him over it to fall as he timed out. "yeah so bye!"he then turned and in a moment Zecora's arms were around her and she kissed him and he smiled putting his hands on her hips but the mare broke the kiss and said, "put them some place useful!"A few days later the Neo Sunny was flying over the next land a large track of semi flooded land filled with ruins of temples as Franky said," yeah to water damaged to revive so let's call this the blue and say no one here! But Look at all the temples!"Nami's eyes sparkled as Robin said, "We should land and check out the ruins!" Nami agreeing as the ship landed.Later on Akihisa as Armoadrillo hit in ot a temple wall to reveal metals mostly gold, "Ok this is like a treasure hunters dreams to many patch work piece to make sense of but all are temples or other place where valuables would be kept!"Nami was smiling as she had a massive bag of gold and hugging it, "it's perfect it's my dream come true I am not leaving!"Celestia was holding a stone tablet with instructions on it and said, "as we will need dig teams here to mine it! as this is blue prints for a generator then how about you and some of the other pirates set up camp and half your crew can take us home before coming back with back up and better digging tools!" she said happily tucking the generator under her arm.Sanji smiled, "robin will want to stay so I will too!"Chopper then yawned, "it's only ten miles forward to get back to the green I'll Just stay mostly as Sanji will be needing blood transfusions soon!"Jinbe rubbed his chin, "it's semi flood a fish man is need here! Robin can't swim because of her devil fruit and neither can chopper my underwater breathing can save there lives if the water level goes up So I most be on the stay team it's the only way!"Luffy smiled and said, "sweet straw hats we have the blue to ourselves yes!... why are we naming all the places after colors?" he asked on the subject everyone shrugged not knowing why.Akihisa smiled yawning, "perfect I just want spent a week relaxing with my harem can't believe I can say that but I have 21 of them now!" he said stunned as all twenty one of his women jumped on top of him hugging him while giggling happily.

    Back in the Green Akihisa had a long day ahead of him it was time to spent time with all twenty one of his girlfriends.he was currently with Yuuko who was reading a book, "this book on zebra potion craft is amazing I can help Zecora but because I am only half zebra they will only be half strength. I can only make blue healing potion not the red one! But oh well it's a help!"Akihsia nodded along and said, "yeah it is!" At with point he jumped when Yuuko moved her plot against his leg and winked," but now I have twenty women to compete against for the number one spot and I am not losing! I am to completive for that!"Akihsia was red and frozen as the Zony kissed him.before long he was with Trotted who was walking with him through the Canyons as she fired off a beam that split into seven beams each a different color, "I want to see if you can beat that!" she said smiling as the seven beams all hit the mountain side.In a moment Akihsia lifted the dial to bring up the manual list and quickly became the alien force version of Chromastone and both his hands fired off the same attack for fourteen energy beams.the power pony leader growled happily at the sigh, "Mama Like!" Akihisa jumped again.next up by the lake was Green who was moving a hand through her mane as she said, "So good to be hone working on the normal things for awhile before going exploring again! After all if Mane-iac is back and sane it means our villains who don't have brain damage to blame for being evil are still around and could revive! So I am a bit on guard.Akihsia nodded as he asked, "yeah but can any of them even be a threat, the pharaoh won't have his army, high heel won't have gadgets, Smudge would be cured as his form is injury, and longface's depression smoke is made form chemicals would be heard to make and beside that we just invent gas mask for getting deeper in the mind."Green held her chin thinking on that and he did have a point not all of them could be a problem.Later on.spruce was looking embarrassed as she walked with Akihsia said," I'm just too big your only up to my stomach…. I bet you feel like beside a big gorilla!" in a moment she jumped when a shadow casted over her.Akihisa as Humungousaur then held his chest," if you don't like me looking up at you then now you can look up at me!" in a moment the mare hugged him happily blushing as she said, "this is why I love you!"next up was aurora formally zapp.in the air she flew panting as Jetray hovered in the air as he asked," you good? Because that was hardly a race I can see dashie doing the same thing but I fly at miles a second you can't beat Jetray."Aurora smiled as she said, "in my home land a stallion had to beat a mare at a race to wed her.. so this is romantic to me!" she said smiling and winking making the alien jump!"later on in the bit. Marey had on a gas mask, as she stood beside Chromastone in a tunnel.the super fast pony used a pick axe to dick but Akihsia was making quicker time by firing off beam attacks to dig it deeper, they were getting close to the gas pocket and need to find it!that is when she hit it and green mist came out as she said, "thank you gas mask we hit it!"Chromastone hit the wall opening a pick enough tunnel for them to step through as he timed out back into a gas mask wearing Akihisa. " well we are!"he said as he walked in with her to see a path and plat form in the middle of a massive stone void. Marey blinked," wait wait… is the planet hollow? That makes no sense! If that was the case it won't work normal right? We would all weight less and be stronger form being used to weighing more right?"the prince then said," if we were working on logic to start with but we aren't! this planet is patch work bits and peaces of others copied and glued together those living on it turned to stone! And beside that weight is mass you can't always see mass! You can't see most gas either!"Marey then spoke up, "so most of the planet is a pocket of gas what if it all leaves!?" she askedAkihisa pointed to a wall where crystal was growing, "looks like as gas leaves crystal grows. To replace the mass. That doesn't explain anything but I've given up on trying to understand this weird world!"Next up was the last power pony Mare-velous.the fillyzon was looking at her beam sword swinging it at Akihsia who was terraspin!the shelled alien fired off a burst of wind sending her flying back as he asked," why…are…your ….dates…always…spares…?"the mare smiled as she drew another one to hold backwards with her shield strapped arm, "filizon can only wed stallions who best them in battle, so same as Aurora this is romantic for me!" she said charging in but the wind pushed her back Always.before long the alien span around his whole body pushing her back past a line as she smiled," and you won!"In a moment Akihsia timed out and Mare-velous dropped her weapons and shields. She then tackled Akihsia grabbing his face and pulling him into a kiss as she knocked him down on his back upon impact making his wings flare.Later on it was night fall and Akihsia walked in to the castle looking drained, as Luna said, "And just thing you have fourteen more mares to go tomorrow and the next day!" she giggled.the anthro Alicorn stallion looked to her, "don't you joke about this aunt Luna! This is the problem with a harem… well that and once a month they all try to kill you, but sense we're equines well most of them it's in a different way!"Luna petted his head," well reality ensues for a reason nephew now when your done the Foundation needs it's best agent you!" she said smiling.Akihsia then went to bed not his bed a guest bed to hide form his harem as he need a brake form them.

"thank you time manipulation Only reason we are not crushed!"Kubo nodded and said," Can you untie me now I have to piss man!" Akihsia nodded as he ripped the rope off and put him down making him run to the can.Elsewhere digging himself out was the batman who laughed, "and Freedom! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"the evil bruce dusted himself off, "Oh Really now I am a mix of joker and Batman I am simple too hard for you to kill!" he said smiling as he remembered his dug in trap door and tunnel he found in the cave and kept hidden to escape form.but he started dissolving in light as necro nag who was dying under the rocks said," My power make you, with out me you can't be real! You die with me!" she then closed her eyes and died making the batman who laughed fade away.the nag had a smile on her face in death she had gotten the last laugh on the batman who laughed! And there by beat both the joker and batman! Something her father two face couldn't do.Later on in the bar of the restaurant to another world Akihsia was talking to the Lion man, "and I just don't get it!" he said speaking, "she give up her eyes and her life to bring back Someone who never bet why?"the lion demon spoke up, "Sometimes we can't let go of the past and want to see what it could have been like So we try it! by doing something we wish we did in our youth. But even that could be to bitter to bare. After all nothing hurts worst then finding out it could have been great but now it's to late!"Akihsia nodded, "So she was to stuck in the past to look ahead?" the lion nodded as he got up and opened the door, "Well I'm going back home now! Bye see you all next week!" he said stepping out back into the castle.he held his chin as he sighed, "well that sucked!"That is when Luna walked by in a black bikini and Akihsia jumped "Aunty what the hell?"Luna had a towel over her shoulder, "we found a heat vent and filled it with water to make a hotspring.

    At the new hot spring pool Luna was smiling as the now normal 035 kicked around on a floaty happily.Luna adjust her bikini bottom while smiling as she happily said, "Well This is a nice day hope it lasts!" she said sitting on the edge as zero popped up with a snorkel in his mouth and goggles he hand her a water proof stack of paper before vanishing down below again.The current head of the foundation rolled her eyes as she looked at him, "That foundation really they found it in the blue! Come on!"Meanwhile with the straw hats in the Blue.Sanji was looking at the Venus statue, "So put this in a fountain the animals that drink form it start turning into humans? Really?

I mean you forget a large number of those ponies were people and a few of them were scared of things with hooves it may be able to help the people who can't look in the mirror with out screaming!"Chopper sighed as he said, "you're right captain it can do some good as well as bad! So I guess we should at least give it the chance to be used for good if that even works!"Zoro walked around his ankles a few inches in water as he said, "hate to brake this conversation up but the tide is coming in So Maybe the devil fruit eaters should get back on the Neo Sunny!"Franky adjusted his sun glasses with his little hands, "yeah this semiflood dig site isn't a good place for most of us! I know I can't swim with all this metal on me! with pains me as I found something I want to dig up! I know I can add some air tanks to my rebuilt of the general franky!" he said running off! Happily before flying on fart power!Jinbe then noticed a call coming on in the bulky phone he had on his back and said, " yes this is straw hats leading dig team! Who is this?"Celestia's voice came out, "it's Celestia I'll be coming over to pick up the statue form the neo Sunny! Buy buy I'm going to throw on a robe over my bikini now!" She then hung up.Sanji was crying while holding the statue Nami then hit him with her staff, "Stop crying over her covering her bikini! You could be releasing mutated water into the ocean! While holding that thing! We don't need no massive mutant sea creatures!"Jinbe nodded as he took it, "yes this thing is dangerous and most be stored till they find a way to use it for good!"Later on when it was retrieved.an earth pony stallion shaking trying not to look in the water because of his crippling fear of horse was being handed a cup of water by Luna who said," the fountain's was used for this take it for a month and see what happens!"A month later the Stallion was being looked at by Caramel and said, "Well your hooves became human feet and you lost your tail but that's it man Sorry! And I've said this for the rest of the group too. That fountain just isn't stronger then the magic of Equestria!"the stallion walked out sad covering his eyes as he jumped at a mare walking out and he ran screaming form the horse.at that point.Luna in her normal outfit adjusted her sunglasses as she walked down a hall with zero, "so much for that now what are we going to do with it!?"zero then spoke up, "Don't know just don't know but we have a problem! We could soulsberg! And an anthro has been added to there numbers!"Luna stopped and did a double take at him, "what but the sword was destroyed!?"Later on in soulsberg with was now inside a cave system below the Green. silver humanoid in suit and tie was speaking with Spruce as he said, "yes our settlement got a new member!"the now silver form of Himeji walked up crying," I don't want to be a living peace of metal!" she cred hiding her face.the former power pony blinked," Just tell us who was using the sword!"The woman cried," there was no blade I was strangled!" she said crying just confusing everyone!At the foundation Zero was confused," Grandma Luna how the hell can a strange make this happen!"the alicorn pulled out a block with thumb tacks glued to the palm and said, "Like this little blades Himeji probably only saw the hand grab her throat but trust me at least a fragment of that blade had to have been used in a manner similar to my mock up!"Unknown to everyone else in the dark some one was walking wearing a black glove with silver spikes on the palm looking through the plant matter for is when a light shined on it.Revealing a silver anthro mare in primitive plat matter bikini top and skirt running " the whroes most die!"the Light was coming form Kuno's horn, "… that voice belonged to Akihisa's sister!

Still stalking me!"Akira tried to run but Akihsia used his mud arm to hold her down, "now now!" he started forcing the mud down her throat as he said, "your time has past as has that weapon of yours Scps can take on new forms useful but just let it in and go to the light big sister I never need you now it's time to die!"Akira blacked out only to awaken in a jail cell as Luna smirked form the other side," he would have killed you but we can't have that weapon leaving you and going to someone else so in here you remain!"the Mare charged banging on the clear crystal all between the bars and Luna as the Alicorn smirked leaving as she said," this isn't my first stalker attack!" she adjusted her sun glasses and smiled, "and contained!"to be continued.quick access list.NRG(3), fourarms(5), diamond head(8), xlr8(5) big chill(5), goop(7), Cannonbolt (3), Waterhazard(2) Terraspin(4), armadrillo(8)manual listbrainstorm (4) upgrades(3) atomix(2) jury-rig ( 5 ) ghostfreak (2) Humungousaur (3) wildvine(3) heatblast (3) Waybig (1) Greymatter(1) eyeguy(1) Chromastone(2) Jetray (2) feedback (1) Chromastone (unseen) echo echo (1) widmutt(1) clockwork(1) mud (1) and 81 others at leastAdded to manual list682 (2)Omake.at the hot spring pool akihisa's harem were in black bikinis happily relaxing as Yuuko said," you guys think Akihisa would have really killed his sister!?"they others laughed at her calling her silly for thinking Akihsia could be a killer!

    In the foundation a human scientist was in a screen looking before " Ok let's run this test!" he said happily adjusting his collar.In there was Akihisa who quickly went Echo echo and made a clone the clone became Wildmutt.the Wildmutt clone walked over to and drank form the fountain and the watch glow activally undoing the waters very visible attempts to make the alien grow eye balls rapidly till it stopped normal, and it killed over.the real akihsia timed out, "ok so the watch stops one form messing with the transformations! Good to know! now what about my Wildmutt clone's corpse?"The man behind the class hit a button, "Simple try and remove the dial!" Akihsia walked over only for the dial to fly off and fuse back into him leaving a dead wildmutt. "yeah that didn't work!"the guy on the other side said," yeah this is raising more questions about that fucking thing then it's answering! Just to be safe try and push the wildmutt into the fountain!" Akihisa then kicked it in, as he said, "Let me guess reanimation scp!"the guy hit a button, " yes!Later on in the a cell what looked like Wildmutt but with eyes and larger Kaine eyes, the green eyes staring as it roared as the scientist held one of the organic guns out and said, "the reanimated and foundation exposed Wildmutt has developed eyes! Nothing else! and seems more savage like gaining side was a de-evolved it to a more savage state!"soon it ripped open it's cell with it's jaws making him fire as rapidly as he could to kill it, till the animal killed over once more.not soon after he was slamming his paper work on Luna's desk, "No more messing with the omnitrix! I almost fucking died by a devolved Wildmutt!"Luna blinked as she adjusted her sunglasses, "Devolved?" she seemed puzzled, "the fountain doesn't do that…. Does it?" she seemed confused. She held her chin, "how many stories are there about people becoming animals?"the guy had left her alone and Luna finished her thought, "Maybe the foundation was made to undo such an event and all the partial failures are the results of the animal having more real animal heritage then human turned animal!"A guy walking by said," if that was the case it would work on plants as well as there are just as many stories of people becoming trees but nope! Doesn't!"Luna nodded as she said, "point taken but I wonder why it act so different with the wildmutt!" she held her chin pushing it aside.Meanwhile in another location known as unlondon!this Scp city had become the hub for the foundation remains and people as well only problem is a few of the old settings would still spring up some times!"in this case the bobbies were walking up around Akihisa as heatblast throwing fireballs to burn the cyborgs leaving behind just there metal joins and screws for head. " the hell is with that!?"he said pushing closer to the home for the poor that seemed to be making this things as he throw more fire balls to burn them, "burn down the place end the civil war between the foundation and the remains of the old AI!" he commented as he throw fire at the building making it burn.As the cyborgs came out as Akihsia took to standing in air on a cloud of fire to rapidly make it rain fire, "Strange strange there are more of you guys then they are missing people! I wonder well what's teleporting for!"he called out running into the burning building to see corpse in cells but what looked like robotic arms were scanning and copying them minus joins and the head on to frames with the metal parts even down to the prison uniforms the corpse were in, "it doesn't make people into brainless cyborgs. I copies people as a base!"he then ran out as it start to fall in on itself as he said," well that was weird! Really weird!" he said as he watched the solider fall down ending this as he said, "and last of the ai for this thing! The underground is ours completely now!"that is when he timed out and noticed something and went to check it out it was a book and he picked it up reading it, "welcome to unlondon's owner guide table of contest adjustments to the food machines, how to alter the fixtures made by the home for the poor, how to adjusted the Ai's personality….. were the fuck was this a week ago!" he said running off with it.Meanwhile.Mare-velous was sword fighting with what looked like a grey maned clone of her spawned by a tree, "cloning tree why cloning tree!" she said kicking the clone away this was getting easier as the clone was degrading and aging quickly!both were using light blades as the clone grabbed one of hers form her belt, but the Fillyzon continued clashing swords with her getting older by the second clone till it was too old to move and fell down unable to stand.the mare walked away into a room and rubbed her wrist as she put up her blade, "yeah your clone still died much faster than it should have and is it normal for such things to attack on site?"Zero walked up and said," No it isn't but they have been shown to be different! So odd odd!"Elsewhere.in a field Pinkie pie was smiling as she filled a planter up with old recovered broken toys and dropped a seed in and watered it, "ok time to see if broken objects will make it grow more broken objectsA few weeks later she came in to see a small tree with a toy car a whole one growing on it she picked it and smiled," yep broken grows complete! ….. we can grow anything now!" she said happy at it!the next week she was giving out toys to the foals and human kids happily as she said, "I have like Ten toy trees for birthday gifts!" she said happily continuing seeing the kids smile as she said, "best Scp test ever!"to be continued.quick access list.NRG(3), fourarms(5), diamond head(8), xlr8(5) big chill(5), goop(7), Cannonbolt (3), Waterhazard(2) Terraspin(4), armadrillo(8)manual listbrainstorm (4) upgrades(3) atomix(2) jury-rig ( 5 ) ghostfreak (2) Humungousaur (3) wildvine(3) heatblast (4) Waybig (1) Greymatter(1) eyeguy(1) Chromastone(2) Jetray (2) feedback (1) Chromastone (unseen) echo echo (2) widmutt(2) clockwork(1) mud (1) and 81 others at leastAdded to manual list682 (2)Omake.Zoro had been giving a seed and he planted it in a planter of broken swords and watered it on the sunny.A few weeks later Sanji walked by and jumped when the things flower opened to reveal a little katana like knife.Zorro picked it and smiled happily, " yes I have done it a sword tree!"the cook looked at him and said," YOU WASTE IT ON SWORDS YOU SHOULD HAVE USED FINE ART!"the swordsmen then yelled out," YEAH LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR TASTE IN ART IS!"Nami's eyes had dollar sighs, "if I had one of those I could grow gold! it's beautiful I need to get one of those seeds!"end omake.

She then hit it. next she was crystalfist again female form was there with the mutations with it.Akihsia mirrored this change as he blinked," Strange I always figured Diamond head for asexual reproduction! Oh well learn something new everyday!"the zebra mare was blushing in crystal form before hitting the dial again up next was dark matter the mutate female galvan stood she had black and white stripped hair in a pony tail.Akihsia was grey matter and nodded he wasn't even up to her knee, "what kind of bizarre sexual Dimorphism is this? But then again the think probably isn't working right and most of this height comes form you! is a possibility!"Zecora drew out some slime and throw it at a tree were it became crystal, "I am not sure we don't have a baseline male and female!"

But I think I make it work!"Zecora's next alien Rush she had the shape of a female member of xlr8's race with fingers but bug like plating as she blinked, "Ok no way for a male to be a lizard and a lady to be a bug! And they the same species! This thing has got to be mixing two up into one!"she then hit her dial for her last transformation a female Humungousaur green scales Axe tail, same gladiator pants but with an armored bikini she also looked like she had a biological turtle shell on her back and bone helmet with a horn and she blinked," got to be mixing!"She then timed out she looked normal but her eyes were now red like her transformations as Akihsia was normal in moment she hugged and kissed him, "when my copytrix times back in I need to learn how to fight with them!"Meanwhile.Luna was burying the tree that's branches grew what ever touched the bark, "we try the omnitrix it does it but it kills over after! It was just to much for it!" she said sighing, "Too bad I will miss it's growing full beer cans"She said burying the tree as she said, "Good by Scp zero three eight! You will be missed with your growing beer, toys and well anything that touched you! we will very much miss the short lived Clones for training or dangerous stuff!

But could we!" she was cut off with a kiss and blushed as she pinned Akihsia to a tree with a smirk, "we will!"elsewhere in the blue.Sanji was cutting meet of what looked like a Reaper leviathan's skeleton and said," between this and the endless bag of potatoes we will eat good for months now hurry up with the boiling sea water to get salt we need to make jerky out of this thing before it decays!" he ordered to see a cartoonishly large pot boiling.chopper in monster point said," A watched pot doesn't Boil Sanji man!

She Smirked at it happily. "did it suck it!"elsewhere in the Green.Walking by the River was Marey she would normally be moving at speed but she was looking for something she saw the other day but couldn't find it.Till she got down and point to brainstorm prints, "Ok this is where me and Akihisa where!" she then point to the tree that wasn't there, "but that tree is in the middle! You don't think….. no no let's not go there!" She then turned and ran into a tree that wasn't there! She backed up and watched a tree on the left move and she said,"…. And I am gone!" she screamed taking off with her super speed as she said," BURN THIS SECTION OF THE FOREST IT IS ALIVE!"there was a laugh as she saw one of the trees move in such away it became clear it wasn't a tree, "Ok what are you?" in a moment it adjusted itself revealing a bipedal werewolf like timberwolf with wooden shields on each arm for hiding. It roared as it charged.the super fast Mare avoid as more revealed themselves, "Timberwolves evolved into ambush predators! JUST WHAT WE FUCKING NEED!" she was quick to pull out a stone knife to try and stab one but it broke!she then screamed only thing saving her was her super speed and even then they were smart enough to know where she would be and block her escape way.the power pony gulped," is this how I die? Eaten by trees!?" she said before turning and seeing a spark and she blinked and remembered watching the humans of human town making fire. "…. Friction! Friction yes!" she said running and rapidly rubbing her hand on one's bark while moving sooner enough it bursted into flames.she jumped back as she watched the wolf run to a lake and the others run form her after all to them it looked like she controlled fire instead of just taking adventage of her speed to make a spark.she looked to her left hand rub burned to hell and it hurt she cried, "well better then death! OUCH OUCH OUCH! OH MOTHER FUCKER! THERE IS SPLINTERS IN IT TOO FUCK!"Later on in town the former power pony had her hand bandaged in a mitten by Michele who said, "I have never seen a third degree rub burn before!"the mare rolled her eyes, "and I never saw ambush Timberwolves who are using tools for said ambush! It's like they hit cave man!"the blonde adjusted her glasses as she rubbed her harem mate's shoulders, " plants were not turned to stone! As such they had the time need to evolve a mind like ours so it's very possible they are cavemen mentally! New to thinking higher though and inventing! There known inventions being shields and camouflage. After seeing you start a fire by may try for range soon! So probably simple sharpened stick spears coming!"Little did they know elsewhere deep in a forest one of the bipedal Timberwolves had used it's claws to sharpen a long stick and throw it at a tree making it stick. It howled in victory having invented for it's kind a spear!not much longer Akihsia as Wildvine showed up looking at them he could understand there howls as words like this and he made the same howls and they understood it! he manipulate plants to hold them still as he declared, "Leave the ponies and humans Alone! Leave them alone!" he said throwing a seed bomb to explode a random building! Before letting them go and leaving.As he left the Timberwolves started bowing as they ran to start making something.A few weeks later watching there village was Zero through a scope as he said," they are bowing to a statue of wildvine! Wildvine is like a god to them! Akihisa is going to hate this! Oh well they are listening to his demand! And as such we can watch them! watching another life form develop civilization! It's like when they found out those monkey's hit the stone ages!"he heard a loud scream of "STOP WORSHIPPING ME YOU ASSHOLES!" Zero blinked and said," how the hell did he know that fast?" he shrugged it off! The new ship would take off and they would finally be mapping this world completely! This was just a distraction!Meanwhile in the next part of the world to be explored!what looked like Green versions of fourarms were dressed n gladiator gear fighting in a massive pit what looked like smaller two armed versions of four arms in the same state of dress.the two armed ones seemed to be quicker allowing them to out move and counter attack the four armed versions with were taller.What was this to mena? Did somewhere on long did four arms evolution split? Or did a group of humans and four arms interbreed to make the two arms! We may never know.but what we did know is a green skinned version of Looma was happily braking her hammer part in to four before hooking them back together in a throwing star like formation and throwing it!As it flow it knocked out many of the two arms, "YOU WON'T INSLAVE OUR KIND ANYMORE TWO ARMS!" She declared with rage as the weapon returned to her and she broke it apart to hold one hammer in each hand.to be continued.quick access list.NRG(3), fourarms(5), diamond head(9), xlr8(5) big chill(5), goop(7), Cannonbolt (3), Waterhazard(2) Terraspin(4), armadrillo(8)manual listbrainstorm (4) upgrades(3) atomix(2) jury-rig ( 5 ) ghostfreak (2) Humungousaur (3) wildvine(4) heatblast (4) Waybig (1) Greymatter(2) eyeguy(1) Chromastone(2) Jetray (2) feedback (1) Chromastone (1) Blitzwolfer(1) echo echo (2) widmutt(2) clockwork(1) mud (1) and 80 others at leastAdded to manual list682 (2)Zecora's aliensway bad (1) wrecking bolt(1) Bashmouth(1) bootleg(1) crystalfist(3) dark matter (1) hot shot (1) squad smash(2) rush(1) and Hellsaurus (1)Omake.Zecora was squad smash moving her arms in a fashion that looked like a martial art for four arms!

So stupid!"beside him Zecora was Wrecking bolt rolling and bouncing off of medieval war machines run by the reds. Now Akihsia had used brainstorm the reds had somehow made a slave race out of the Greens so a side was easy to pick.Looma was behind them both watching stunned at the two shape shifters. The reds fleeing form the unknown enemy as both timed out.Looma bowed and said, "Geee what amazing warriors say you wouldn't happen to be able to turn into my kind would you?"Akihsia held his out, "I can but the color is wrong he's red!" Zecora point to hers and said, "Blue!"Looma held her hands out and said, "No such thing as a wrong color guys! We have browns blues yellows and even redish browns on our side! the browns and redish ones are half bloods but we are as cool with them as we are with the missing half the green color ones! While we call our enemy reds it's only because those raciest bastards call us greens! No matter the color."they blinked as Looma lead to them to base.there Gar Green wind Loomas father and missing one arm point and said, "what are this creatures you bring here daughter!"In a moment Zecora and Akihsia hit there dials, Ben became big chill Zecora Bashmouth and Looma said, "powerful shapeshifters father they are both one living thing armies literally they saved me! form what I can tell the Male is a prince with a harem and back up on it's way! Come on this is our chance to end the Red's slavery!"Gar held his chin and said, "gee I don't know I never saw a plant eater that could fight! No offense just food chain!"Akihsia and Zecora then became Fourarms and Quad smack and Ben said, "How about a fight to prove it!"the leader said, "Gee that sounds fair, normally I am not a fan of the color red but you wear it well Ok my daughter can handle two at once go get them!"In a moment Looma broke her hammer into four and charged at them.Zecora was quick to block the left two arms by holding them back and Action repeated by Akihsia with the left arms. But instead of punches they went in for knee to Looma's stomack.Looma was knocked back dropping her weapons to hold it as Gar held his chin, "never seen that before what was that called?"Akihsia then said," a kick!" as he went in for four punches with Looma held back, Only for Zecora to move around back and grab Loomas arm holding them up keeping her form using them.Allowing Akihsia to land four punches at once as Gar said, "oh and what is that called?" he asked excited! Zecora called out," A hold!"Looma waved her hands giving up! And both shape shifters timed out and Gar hugged them, "you beat my daughter my tradition She is now part of your harem Welcome to the family son and daughter in law! I want to meet my other daughters in law as quick as possible!"he then heard a beeping sound as Akihsia pulled out a small disk, "land ran communication device!" he hit a button, "yeah Akihsia here! With slave rebellion and new harem girl Looma!"the device spoke with Celestia's voice, "Really you are gone for five minutes and you already have a new harem girl! I'm sorry I am Celestia this shape shifting knuckle heads mother!"Looma said, "hi mother in law!" she sounded happy trying to get Zecora and Akihsia out of her father's arms.Gar smiled as he let go so Looma could hug them "Looking forward to working with you and meeting the rest of the in laws! You have raised an amazing young lad Ms! "On the ship Celestia sighed as she said, "I know I know!" she said speaking into a tube, "We will be docking our ship on the shore line by that skull looking cliff in an hour! If you can't tell time Akihisa and Zecora know it!"Gar's voice called out, "Oh I know that beach! It's just one killmack form our current location! We'll be there in five zings!... we need to compare units of time and measurement to get a conversion system going!"Celestia rolled her eyes and said," Ok then see you when we see you! I am ending this call now! As the guy behind me wants to call his mother!" She then hung up!Later on as they docked the Greens army was there. Akihsia's harem running up to meet Looma.Spruce smiled at her, "finally someone I can look at eye to eye!" she said happy to have another tall super strong lady in it!Fluttershy summoned a war hammer construct and Looma said," Oh my you can magically make weapons! You are the best one!" Green summoned the same weapon and Looma gasped hands on her face, "Oh my two best ones!"Gar meanwhile was hugging Celestia, "so you are Celestia! Nice to meet you in person miss! I am just so happy my little Looma found someone and we can end this war with another Army with strange weapons and fighting moves the Red's never saw! We don't want to kill them just agree to a boarder and they stay on there side. you understand. We aren't violent monsters just fighting a war to not be slaves."Yuuko held her chin and said, "I've been looking at the facts how did they inslave you?"Gar put Celestia down and flexed, "I can see why you would have a hard time buying it with this muscles our arms. So I shall explain it isn't a matter of might but mind! The red had one guy who found stones that could shock and made collars and remotes to shock us with horrible pain to make us listen to them!"there was gasping as Sunset said, "Shock collars!"Gar pointed and said," yep! Anyway our rebellion start as the stones turned out to an amount of shocks they could give before just being rocks! And they ran out of new rocks! So time let us escape little by little and all! Just in time one event something called a battery with could do the job of the stones!"Miharu was shouldering Hazuki's weapons form, "nothing worst then assholes who are stupid enough to think something is limitless!"The leader smiled and said, "yes yes!

"I am playing support and I am good at it!" she commented stunned on the role she was playing.Pinkie pie was smiling as she hopped around the battle field, she then said, "not the kind of party I like but oh well!" she then pulled out a shield and swung it behind her knocking out a red that tried to sneak up on her. " ultra instinct!"Applejack was swinging around a pitch fork to hold back four red army men's swords. The Greens charged in punching the held still red's away.Celestia smiled as she swung her staff sending off a magical shock wave that knocked away the Fifty men that charged her. " Oh it's so nice to get off the throne!" she said cracking her neck, "you can almost forget I am a goddess of the sun!"the red's retreated and in a moment Crystal fist and Diamond head touched the ground making a massive crystal wall that split the location down the middle! Red side green side! Green wind's wish had come true this was victory!they all cheered.Later on Michelle was looking at one of the rocks, "Mars! This is Martian rock this location is a peace of mars!"Zecora in her normal form rolled her eyes as she eat an apple, "that does not matter it's probably a different mars then the one you battled bug people on as a bug person!"they then saw a shadow over a mountain there was a giant dragonfly but Looma said," relax those big bugs never leave the purple! That's what we call what starts at that blue mountain!

    While On the new Ship's air mode heading off to the purple.Celestia was looking over holding her chin asking a male crew member, "are you thinking what I am?"The crew men then said," that in a right world hideyoshi would be pregnant with a baby daddy not a man with two baby mommas?"The white alicorn then whacked him on the head with her staff and said," get your head out of that place!"Akihisa walked up as Waterhazard " I am off to go refill the water tanks!"The white alicorn rolled her eyes, "I was thinking on the nature of this planet for the record!"She said looking at it the crimson was part of mars but a different one then the mars part in the red and white.the Green looked like one land mass but was many fused into one! Then there was the Black. The witches restored it easy upon being freed yet it wasn't just there home there was statues of children for them to adopt and grant magic. Not one adult who didn't have magic in them!It was all too perfect to be random. She know the dream guy said it was the work of the bad guy but who is that? And how did they do this? She said looking down at the crimson as they traveled above it.How strange wonderous and odd this was! A path work plant! Yet every place was set up for something! The Green was set up to quickly go form stone age to industrial with bulky tech of stuff after that as it always had what they need. Not one resource was left out! They even had oil for pathing a road for transport.Plus the steam punk City was more modern and set up to spread around the tech and power lines being moved to bring them out of the stone age even quicker!the Black's magic tech was reverse engineered quickly as well! Plus the pure bloods magic stone tech! gave them tools that fixed themselves to make building faster.They need to travel water ways to explore thanks to the winds blowing them back if they went to far form the land masses. They had a crew who were only pirates as they were against there world government that allowed the top dogs to own slaves.The Red and White while patch work had a middle ground were Jaune found out new information to use with his dark side powers to make more chimeras Improve the not all there revival!the terrorformars did not leave there home no matter what! They had wings yet would only go as far as flying over the land mass, they never even tried.She looked ahead at a massive butterfly that was being shoot down as they crossed the line into the purple. Now this bugs didn't even travel into the crimson! It was as add as the flying stones of the yellow making air travel easier!Again it was all set up to steer them towards somegoal Quickly as possible! But what was it? What was this taking them to?she was pulled out of her though on her worlds nature by the Sight of the butterfly's back cracking open to reveal a human skeleton in the back!The ship landed as they all got out stunned by it. Looma shivered," IT was once people!"Zecora quickly became bootleg and Akihsia Greymatter. In a moment Zecora's head became a chair with a screen for Grey matter, "that is for this study to show!" he viewed it as he said," Well it is probably likely that some of this bugs were once human this skeleton is to clean! Never broken never moved! It's more likely a human morphed into a bug was this things ancestor and in the egg it develops human before switching to bug by growing around the unformed human as a base!"Zecora moved to the human skull like butterfly head with eyes that looked like a hybrid of bug eyes and human! Compete with public within the segmented eyes. She just said, "Creepy."Akihsia then jumped off, "interesting enough it appears what caused the original human to bug transformation is viral! Don't worry it's nothing that can effect anyone! The virus remains are all common things even humans can fight! The humans form were ever this rock part came form most have not evolved to same as us! If a simple thing like Small poxs turned them into bugs! No really it's the small pox virus!"both shape shifters then timed out! Celestia rolled her eyes," I was just thinking about how over convenient rebuilding has been!"Michelle adjusted her glasses, "as a human turned into a bug I feel like I should be here!"Marey allen was moving her legs, "I'll scout!" she then zipped off and a second later returned with a human statue head," found some guy!"Akihsia quickly turned into Brainstorm and said," heads to sanded down for revival but the mind is still intact so let's see if I can do this!" lighting went form his head to the guys, "I am reading the dead man's brains the hives are called cages, the bugs are known as Cagasters and YES GUESS WAS RIGHT!"Yuuko hit him on the head with her staff" people turning into killer bugs! Not something you want to be right about!"Brainstorm rubbed his shell as he said, "Look Zecora has rush who is a bug and I have big chill who is a bug! WE can explore and meet you on the other end of the purple you all take it up higher then they are flying and cross over and wait at the boarder for us!"they nodded The harem girls all giving akihisa a kiss and a hug before heading back on board, While Zecora quickly became rush and the two headed off into the cage filled ruins for study as if they didn't know Luna would have them go back to do it!While seeing it Akihsia came to some partly mutated statues and shivered, "so gross got stoned right in the middle of turning into a bug!"to be continued.quick access list.NRG(3), fourarms(6), diamond head(10), xlr8(5) big chill(6), goop(7), Cannonbolt (3), Waterhazard(3) Terraspin(4), armadrillo(8)manual listbrainstorm (5) upgrades(3) atomix(2) jury-rig ( 5 ) ghostfreak (2) Humungousaur (3) wildvine(4) heatblast (4) Waybig (1) Greymatter(3) eyeguy(1) Chromastone(2) Jetray (2) feedback (1) Chromastone (1) Blitzwolfer(2) echo echo (2) widmutt(2) clockwork(1) mud (1) and 80 others at leastAdded to manual list682 (2)Zecora's aliensway bad (1) wrecking bolt(2) Bashmouth(2) bootleg(2) crystalfist(4) dark matter (1) hot shot (1) quad smack (3) rush(2) and Hellsaurus (1)Omake.On the other end of the purple was a large Grey desert!

    Akihisa was currently big chill breathing ice to freeze a massive dragonfly as he said, 'So fucking creepy knowing it has human ancestors!"Zecora was Still rush happily using speed to remove the legs form a massive centipede leaving it flopping around almost helplessly, "I know my darling stallion!"the male shape shifter was flying, "I know they can't detect us thanks to us being bugs but still this is creepy!" he said flying past turned to stone people statues that had bug parts as part of them, 'I mean it's worst then the terraforms!"Zecora nodded as they made it to the edge of the location on to the land of grey sand were everyone else was timing out.Celestia the rest of the harem and the crew smiled they had set up shop here, as the princess said, "your just in time there is only one thing in this place!" she said pointing to a temple! " come with mommy Akihsia!" she happily said leading the way.Akihsia blinked as he followed and the temple with looked like a old school Romain temple's door opened as Celestia said, "Only mother and Son of alicorn may enter was on the door! This was put here for us Son!"the shape shifter looked at her blinking out of instinct he became eyeguy as he walked around with it, "So what this whole world was built to Test us? I don't get it and what makes me special I was just a random high school idiot before I got this watch and meet you Mom!"A digital voice said, "yet you want to be special and Celestia want to be a mother! Your wishes have been granted."Akihisa looked around for a speaker and said," And how many people did you hurt for that?"The voice said, "all locations and life forms are copied form other worlds! As copies no one was harmed or died!"Celestia looked around as she used her staff to tap awhile, "Are you this bad guy the dream man warned us about on day one of this journey?"the voice replied, "No I am just an Ai here to answer the quest I have been progrmed to answer!"While walking down the hall Akihsia fired an optic blast at a sensor he saw on a wall making a door open revealing a change form Stone to metal white metal. As they took that path the area slowly became decorated with Lunar symbols as Akihisa timed out.the princess was next to speak, "Really well what can you tell us about this?"the Ai said, "this is lunar temple! Will only work when world was mapped! Temple is too the new moon Rising phase of Stone battle world!"they soon came to a path that looked more like energy like Luna's mane as they walked on it Akihisa said, " And what is that phase!"they soon came to a model of Earth with images of Zombies as the ai said, "this is not model it is a shrunken copy of an Earth in a zombie outbrake will now send to space and reenlarge making it planetary neighbor for space travel to be a thing!"the roof opened as the small earth fly up out into the night sky where it grow large enough to be seen! The ai then said, "Restarting time on it! time flowing again! Temple done shutting down!"the temple vanished leaving them in the Grey sands the quest to map the world was over and done and it was time to return home! And deal with the new world in the sky.Meanwhile on the GreenHideyoshi was with hana and Mane-iac looking up at the sky, "What did they do now?"hana laughed and said, "what I'ts pretty better then that smirking bastard!" she said pointing at the soul eater men and yelling," GO AWAY WE DON'T NEED YOUR ASS ANYMORE!

    On the Green Loom was beside Akihisa as Fourarms and Zecora as quad smack.

"I don't know Franky is drawing a blank."Zecora was in the same state as she said, "Jetray can make the trip and open a portal!"Akihisa nodded as he said, "yeah but I owe the rest of my herd some alone time as well."Little did he know not to far away on the red and white.Jaune was sitting on his throne looking up at it the sith lord smirked, "a new world! A praise Jewel hovering in the night sky of battle world!" the ghost of lord vader appeared and spoke, "yes a gem so fresh with possibility danger and riches!"the sith lord sitting on his throne," I have a harem a throne a daughter why would I give a got dam shit about that world unless it attacks me! I am not a greedy idiot! Greed is what does you all in! your master his Greed for power lead to his end when he turned you to the dark side. you fell when you wanting it all lead to you losing it all. I have learned form the lessens of failure in Sith history!"vader tried to put on a force choke but Jaune waved his hand freeing himself form it as he summoned force wraith to attack the ghost! The ghostly lord called on a spear of dark side lighting to slash the false spirits Jaune summoned.the blonde said, "I mean no disrespect master but I have grown stronger while you grow weaker! Your holocron is braking and you are losing your grip on the realm of the living as such master! To much of your power is going to remaining here to stand up to me now! I respect your knowdlge but there comes a time were ever leader most fall back to advice for the new one."the ghost walked off vanishing as he called out, "I have trained you well!"Elsewhere on the Green.Yuuko was walking spinning her staff as she walked beside Trot as she asked, " So What are we investigating!?"Trot used her horn to light up a cave, "This place!" She said inside of it was seemingly random words and phrases. Carved refering to things like spider equals dog fine dog.Yuuko blinked before she jumped to see what looked like a spider the size of a dog panting carrying a ball in it's mouth it dropped it and panted like a puppy.Yuuko used her staff to knock the ball away and the spider crawled off after it dropped it again and Yuuko repeated this before asking, "….. am I playing fetch with a spider?"Trot nodded as she light up the area to see more dog sized spiders acting like dogs," …. Scps are the craziest! Giant spiders that act like dogs."She backed away and froze the cave door, " yeah this is going to lock it up Come on we have more rounds to find!"they head off to the next location they were exploring, a river, form the water came something! It looked like a mermaid waving at them " hi!" she said smiling she had a dolphin tail and colored skin human like face but bold and wearing shells as a bikini.Trot adjust her glasses, "Ok how?" she asked the mermaid said," Simple this fountain was in the water as me and the other dolphins swam through and bam we're mermen and women!"Yuuko rolled her eyes," and sense our mammals it worked! Well that answers that one! Ok you have any thing that may make you a threat or a request to live peacefully."the mermaid held her chin, "no not really bye bye striped cutie if your ever in the water give me a call!" she jumped into the water.Yuuko jumped," A mermaid just hit on me ok then! What's next!" she called off as they head out for there next investigation of scp!But Elsewhere the sun had set making it night.Spruce was happily walking around the forest smiling as she enjoying the peace before a next adventure but then she heard something. She turned fist up as what looked like a human skeleton made of stone came out to try and punch her but she smashed it with one hit, "More Golems? We handled the pure bloods!"the Golem did not reform as a voice said," this isn't those inbreed fucks!" she then turned to see what looked like one of the a male earth pony no mane, black tail dressed in black primitive pants.his eyes were yellow orbs and black tar, "We are the dark breed!" he summoned two more golems!"spruce flow forward smashing the Golems and then trying to hit the guy only for him to summon stone to his arms to block her hits, granted he was remaking his stone gauntlets with each hit.but he kept it up allowing him to match Saddle rager blow to blow till the sun came up and he screamed exploding into ash and dust.Saddle rager's eyes widened, "….

    At night Fluttershy was using her new darkness powers to direct A black energy construct of a Chinese dragon in a way that made it look like she was dancing at a night breed member.the night breed member was as dark furred and bold as the first, She was dressed in grey tribal top and lion cloth.the mare was a pegasus in the air she wasn't avoiding the construct instead letting it pass through her harmlessly.Fluttershy was growling as she struck a pose making the dragon curl around her as she said," Care to sure why I can't touch you and why you say you're power comes form the same thing I got power from!"the mare hovered, "fine! The darkness was a gift the pure blood splinter tribe found! It granted them power there children were rejected for being opposite in color and dammed to the shadows as the sun became toxic to us born with us! Black light find the last darkness crystal and took it! then it jumped to you upon death! Your foals will be like us! Dammed to the dark unable to pass the darkness on! It grants power but forsakes one's children! It was not a gift but a curse that you now bare!"Fluttershy's eyes widen as her construct vanished and she fell to her knees, "… No no no!" she looked at her hands, "if this is going to hurt any children I have then I don't want it!" she said screaming in rage as she held out her hands making a dark shadow in a vague anthro shape leave her.the rainboom was returned to her original form with out it and fly off, "I DON'T WANT YOU!"the shadow being then looked to the night breed mare and grabbed her making her fall dead as shadows left her and entered it!the shadow then flew forward searching for more night breeders!the next day thanks to magic cameras they had pictures of the shadow and the night breed along with Fluttershy's reborn.Luna was looking at it all sitting with Arrow head," Talk?"the pure blood said, "I don't know nothing I always thought the story of the other tribe was just a bed time story meant to scare foals into following the rules. All I can say is we have a legend that backs up the story Fluttershy heard that's it!"Luna looked to the second mare at the table Fluttershy "and about your shadow thing?"Fluttershy shrugged, "I just didn't want my powers anymore and they left! I don't know! I think it was some kind of parasite I just forced out!" She was confused by it all!Luna turned to another seat at her table, "Ok Zero tell grandma good news please?"the stallion said, "there is no Goodness just badness and weirdness!" he then put a hand on the table, "weirdness the night breed the shadow are praying are still solid not burning in day light showing burning in day light is a bodily function! Badness is the nightbreed are begging for protecting form the darkness!"Luna blinked adjusting her sun glasses, "And how is them begging for protection badness!"Zero tapped the table with his hand, "I will ask everyone to face facts what ever this is the nightbreed all have parts of it! and it's drawn to it's pieces! If we work with the nightbreed we are putting our own soldiers and civilians at risk of being collateral damage in this things hunt!"The alicorn gulped as adjusted her tie and said," oh ok then fair point! But we can't just ignore it and go to the moon! We don't know what this thing is or what it could mean! And why it was so willing to be passive while it had a host!?"elsewhere in the caves underground the nightbreed were screaming some running into the light of day to die as the shadow came to hunt!before it's rampage was over the nightbreed was done to one erth pony mare in the tribal outfit but the shadow looked at itself, "it's enough!"It became solid a humanoid bear alien with white tomach skull like face with flesh covered jaw two thin horns lack claws and talons on it's feet black stripes on it's side and a white stomach.it walked out leaving the mare gasping in fear and shaking till nightfall came.Where akihsia Sunset And Yuuko showed up Akihsia then said," so it became a life form! Come on you have a name?"the night breed lady shock as she said, "ebony!" she was shaking and shivering but Akihisa sighed and held the shaking lady, "I keep getting pulled to weird mares!" he said picking her up!MeanwhileZecora was facing the darkness as way bad as giant form was punching at a giant dark shadow energy construct of a boxer matching her blow for blow as the darkness stood laughing before giving his construct an extra left arm to hit her in the head knocking her out and making her change back!"Moments later Akihisa stepped out of a portal as clockwork and hit his dail to become feedback.he held out his hands sucking up the dark energy, "please I trained against your powers when Fluttershy had them! I know Feedback is your weakness! Zecora wake up!" he said using his tail to give her a light shock waking her up.In a moment the striped mare got up hit her dial to become Rush and fall back As akihsia charged the darkness spawning what looked like Seven Chinese dragon constructs " I am not a fragment trapped anymore!"feedsback jumped forward so, hands antenna feet and tail each absorb on construct, "you may have given yourself solid form but it's still energy to matter!" he said falling forward and landing a hand on him!the darkness screamed as the dial glow and he said," with is how 682 got captured in the omnitrix!"in a moment the bad guy was sucked in! Akihsia then changed into him but with the dial on his chest, "Well I ddi it! got another one! Contained!" he said timing out.Later that night.he was meeting up with Ebony the mare taking his hand as they walked along a beach at night A first date the night breed smiling, "We want freedom to find a cure for our course and be free I seen how they got it by making the main darkness be free! I am yours forever defeater of the darkness my prince!"Akihisa rolled his eyes, "See I am not much for those kind of lines but I'll accept it form you!"unknown to him the rest of his harem was watching form the bushes happily smiling.

But we got ebony out of it!" the night breed mare hid under the water as she was more shy then Fluttershy.Mare-velous was leaning her back against the edge, "yeah now what's the hold up on going to the other planet? We can do this! The darkness made the night breed problem easier then the pure blood one! What's the hold up Ladies?"Marey was using her speed to and dry every lady's manes at once, "Simple Akihisa doesn't like it that ebony needs to Run and hide every morning so he is on a strike not using his transformations to help they agree to space station with no windows for no daylight for Ebony to live on with out fear of burning up!"spruce was red as she said, "yeah it's a lovely thing!

Mostly!" She said pointing to this one that had normal stone walls and even then there was clearly cemented closed windows with small battery powered lights and torches lighting the ways.Looma used her four arms to wash the backs of all four pie sisters as she said, "I mean as it is he had to light proof our high spring cave! So Ebony can take a bath slash wait for night some place safe!."ebony was under water still just fine as Pinkie pie pointed," her night breed power is she needs no air! She can be down there forever!"Zecora looked through her playlist before becoming Hellsaurus to pull out ebony and hold her up saying, "Now now you most overcome this shyness as a herd we are team players not one on oners!"Sunset held her hands up and said," yeah we have become too Close in that respect!"Twilight flapped her wings to pull Sunset closer to her making the red head blush, "come on now sunset don't be so Shy! Beside We all know the alpha female here is Spruce!"Rarity was fanning herself, "so much yuri in a group harem bath! It's so scandalous!" she said looking away as Rainbow dash hugged applejack form behind making the country girl go read.Applejack was red faced and said, "While ah's will put on a show for Akihisa that's not how my barn door swings!"Dashie nibbled Aj's ear," Applejack it's a harem we are akihisa and each other's wives! You have more wives then husbands so yes it is! It's the most way it swings!"Fluttershy blushed and looked away, "I should have just kept my darkness powers should have did it and skipped all this and not been so shy!"Maud then let out a flat," you are in a royal harem Fluttershy! How can you still be shy?"Limestone laughed as she turned to hug Looma, "yes we are a group of girls who have gone a bit wild! Heheheheh!"marble sighed as she said," Mommy warned us about those kind of guys!... I hoped she was right!" she said happily.Arrow head rolled her eyes as she grabbed a towel to get up and out, "yeah now if you don't mind I am going off to try off! My fur fluffs after being tired So I have an hour of fighting it down so I don't look like a giant marshmallow!"Yuuko waved as she grabbed a towel to and got out, "I best get out too! If I get to hot my stripes get all funky angled and I look like an abstract painting!"Zecora timed out letting Ebony go as she grabbed a towel to leave as well putting it on with a cry off, "Agreed my sister we most look our best for our mister!"sunset was red and toweled up, "I am leaving as Twilight is clearly drunk and in a flirty move!"the purple Alicorn was red blushing as she held a sake bottle, "if they didn't want you to be drunk in the hot spring with your wives they would have that sake raft that magically appears and makes a lap before vanishing! Oh look there it is!" she said as it passed by.she put her empty one up and grabbed another, "yay! I'm drunk in a hotspring with gives me reason to pass out in to one of my fellow harem girls love pillows even though society says I shouldn't be interested when I really really am!.. Oh did I say that out loud! Oh well Looking your way Fluttershy the heavy weight!"Fluttershy was holding her chest like she always did manly because they would float if she didn't spruce didn't even have that problem! " eeep!" was all she could say!" So she used a wing to grab a towel and leave.Twilight saw dashi toweled up as she said," well the only acup is out So it'll be a fun landing no matter who is left in with me!"Miharu looked to her she had remained quite this whole time but she said, "yeah you think that would be me but no! I honestly think her acups are what makes dashie the hot one! But you know me! I had a think for Minami! Now I would get out but I like to be out last!"the purple alicorn smirked as she said, "then you the landing pad!" she started hiccupping as she said, "I need someone to help me stand up before I pee in here…. To late!"Every woman jumped out grabbing a towel and they cried out, "TWILIGHT SPARKLE!"the purple lady said," what it has fliters for that!"Meanwhile Celestia walked over to her son who was sitting in a circle holding an on strike sigh. The mare said, "Ok you win we will make your space station!"Pinkie pie was toweled up passing, "good someone go tell ebony when we get the net to fish out Twilight's drunk as a stunk plunk!

    In space Akihisa and a group of ponies were building on a plate form he was currently Graveattack to give gravity so they could build. Thanks to a suit ripping and an anthro being find they found out this nutty place had air in space!akihsia was smiling, "air in space makes this simpler we can skip all the air systems on it!" he said as they were building a plate form the size of a city before working on it more!Zecora was melting them down as hot shot while working she whistled. They would have there space station.Meanwhile down below on Earth.Twilight sparkle was stretching her wings beside Rainbow dash and Spruce, "We really doing this?"spruce adjusted her Wings, "Trying to fly all the way to the other earth? Yes!"an hour later the three mares were in a river washing ash off there fur as Marey brough them new cloths as she said," Sorry Twilight your magic bumble just wasn't strong enough to handle three at that fricktion!"Twilgiht put on new glasses, "that's the thing there should be friction! If there is air in space our world's air should be connect directly to space! No leaving the atmosphere!" she then used a spell to put the new cloths on the three of them as she sat on a rock. " there was an unknown layer of Gas that make it a struggle to fly through that made Friction I didn't bet on happen!"Dashie sat down and stretched her cramping wings, "yeah and how could you not know that eggheads?"Spruce sighed as she got up, "simple Akihisa warped there he bypassed the unknown gas layer!" she said popping her back into place, "it simply got to hard to flap and we fell Twilight got to tired to hold her spell and we fell fast making us heat up and get a little burnt!"Marey then held her chin, "so it looks like if we don't want to wait on Franky making air ships to test or Akihsia to warp we need someone who flies with out wings!"it was a moment before the four mares all smirked! Later on Radiance was in her bumble flying through space past the construction site as she carried on camera in hand she fly making it to the other earth.On it Lots of rotten zombies she saw she took pictures making it print on ot paper new model instant print Camera had Ten shots in it!" the pictures fell into her bubble as she hovered taking more of ruined cities some lights on it!Not one sight of life though! She got curious as she picked up her pictures and landed on the top of her tower to fire off a burst that looked like fireworks a signal she hovered in the air waiting and waiting.but nothing she sighed it was looking like nothing but rotten barely moving corpse called this world home! She was disappointed and showing it! everyone dreamed of another planet to help them recover but this was nothing but corpses groaning mindlessly as they fell apart over each other.She flow off to show the pictures To Akihsia who had timed out and looked at them, "I'll just go Gutrot and spray the planet with a mist to speed up rot they will be cleared out and we can make it a home!"Radiance nodded and flow back her scouting mission complete. She headed off showing Luna the Pictures as Luna looked at them and said, "this can still be something great opportunity!"The alicorn smiled at the images, "Clock work can turn back time and restores the cities and we can move on to a world already modern! And use those factories to speed up recover here! We jump form early iron with some minor advancements we shouldn't right to the digital age! Over night!"Later on in Space Ebony was being given a tour he had used to fast forward the build it was a fortress city in space with a roof and what not enough mass to generate close enough gravity no windows but glowing fungus and animals alogn with growing mushroom forest areas "and behold a place you and any kids we have can live with out fear of burning in the light of dawn!"Within a moment she grabbed him and pulled him into a kiss! Happily holding him close before braking it and pinning him to a wall.Later on.On the other earth Akihisa was Gutrot and he let out the Gas making the undead rot to bone rapidly he kept doing this! He had given a sample for the lab ponies to make!they would continue, to rot the zombies globally not want to play god he want all of it to be rotten so he could single out organic matter in his rewind!it would be a long week of spraying for the undead to be rid of them before they would restore this world's cities to take as their own completing all goals! World mapped. Civilization restored.the goals stated when he first revived had been completed time to focus on something else.Months later people and ponies form the areas of stone battle world were in restored city going about life happily as if it was never sent back to the stone age.On top of a building Akihsia was sitting, he only restored one city of all the lands of the world one each! The rest was up to them!but it appeared to be over he sighed and looked to the omnitrix, "Do I even need you anymore!" that is when a message came up saying," yes you do!"he jumped it was coming form the omnitrix, "this was only the prologue Boy! Form here on out the real challenge starts this universe isn't as empty as it's one sun , two planets and two moons makes it out to be!"he blinked before he was turned to armadrillo and took the hint and hopped down to drill he drilled under till he found metal a massive dome, "something else is on this planet! Sleeping!"In a moment he became big chill phasing through he saw empty pods for cryo sleep clearly meant to out last the dead but he also walked around it, "I didn't effect organic matter they should have slept longer!"that is when he noticed some dirt sparkling red and he said, "I need to look at this!" he hit the dial to become upgrade. He used the eye to scan it," this stone has time altering properties and it was all around it!"he used his eye beam to burn what he was seeing in to a wall before hitting to fail to change brainstorm.

    On the New world well below it in the cave systems. Miharu had Hazuki shouldered the cave had it's own ecosystems mushroom forests glowing animals eyeless ones moving around it was creepy, " leave it to Akihsia to mistakeningly start a genesis.:the lizard man came out roaring as it charged only for Miharu to use her weapon partner to smash the thing in the face knocking it out cold," does this thing have no idea of tool use!?"Hazuki smiled," who cares we killed it easy let's find more to kill! Come on I want to be covered in blood dam it!" Miharu looked to the spiked club, "My pure blood boyfriend likes me So don't judge me bitch! Just use me to kill got dam it!"Elsewhere below Akihsia was before a group of the lizard men the omnitrix let him understand all sentient species langue but this things didn't have that! They were just animals that had people as an ancestor! He hit his tail to change form to Gutrot!he released a smoke screen before changing to heatblast to light the smoke making it explode around him making a cave in happen around him!he then walked out of it as ghostfreak. He hovered before timing out, "Another mess to clean up! Well I don't know why after all they haven't gone above why not just leave this to them!"Michele was in her part bug form stretching her arms, "We can't! it's like the terraformers they are in the way! We need to study to make cures for any virus that may have evolved. Gutrot and dark matter may be a good start for it but we still can't explore and do what needs to be done with them in the way! So let's learn form my world's mistake and handle them now!"Akihisa sighed," yeah but they were once people! How do we know they won't turn back into people at some point?" he said hitting the dial to become the darkness. Where he summoned constructs of samurai made of shadows to fight for him as more of the lizards showed up, "I don't have to like it!"Elsewhere.Zecora was Hellsaurus Smashing here way through more of the lizard men she was quickly smashing them they just charged to try and kill with a simple rush! But when they jumped on her back she just rolled along the ground crushing them to death. They were not quick and small enough for this simple strategy to do a thing!before long arrows where fired hitting them in the head making them die as Ebony stayed on a cliff smirking, "My space home is nice but I think I would prefer a below ground wing at the castle here for a home! Closer to my husband and wives! Let's leave the space station for business!"Elsehwere below.Akihsia was still with Michelle as he said," I swear the omnitrix spoke to me!" the blonde was about to say something but the watch said, "Really you dough the claim when you yourself are part insect and can copy other bug powers by kissing them! no really that freeze breath you just used was copied off big chill! And with all the scps How is a talking object of power that strange?"the blonde jumped as the alicorn flicked the watch," see what I mean! Ok I have a witness stop playing dumb and answer me what are you!"the watch then shined, "fine let me get my face on!" the watch projected a hologram of Azmuth, "I am azmuth maker of the omnitrix yes Greymatter is my DNA! But I scanned my mind to digitize it to act as the omnitrix Ai program! I've been watching you and I dare say I like you!"before they could continue Akihisa need to change quickly so he slammed down becoming Chromastone to fire energy beams at more lizard men mindlessly walking at them while Michelle smashed them with fists to the head," Ok why wait till now to speak and what do you mean it's just starting!"Azmuth's voice continued as he said, "My program was still booting up a mind is a large thing to load in the background! As for what I mean I mean that! You built a civilization that now lives on Two worlds!

She said being forceful!Azmuth then spoke up saying," I am not a dirty old man lady! This isn't an anime!

Some times I forget that!" She said nervous before saying," would it please my husband and master if I were to dance for him as a sorry!" tiara made a grossed out face.the blonde got up, "No time for that!

    Chapter Text
    Jaune was walking along a crystal rainbow path in a crystal void with Akihisa as he spoke," you see it Do you See this Akihisa! The core of our universe!"the Sith lord span holding his saber out as lighting covered it, "I have done it! all sith lords dreamed of seeing this and I fucking nailed it! and I had to take you! even if it's by way of your transformations you are the only other being in our universe with the right mix of genius and madness to enter the void between life and anti-life and walk the path down the line to the center of all things!"Akihisa blinked as he said," yeah don't I feel special!" he said looking around," were are you taking me!?"Jaune smirked as his free hand sparked with lighting, "to it! the one behind this pocket universe the stone battle world and new world! The one behind our new powers! The one behind it all!"the alicorn blinked wanting to call bullshit on this but In a moment Jaune waved his hand revealing a light in the distances on a crystal! " be hold!" he flow into the air to use his hands to force pull it to them, "behold the bad guy! The one the dream man told you about!"it was just a massive crystal spinning. Jaune summoned out what looked like force wraith to attack it but it did nothing, "Look at it! not alive or need for our universe it is just a drone doing a program for our world! We can fight what it is programed for and right now is our chance it is inactive! Not doing anything! If we destroy it now What happens on our worlds will truly be of our free will!"Akihsia slapped the omnitrix to become Waybig and he punched it before crossing his arms to fire off an energy ray just cracking it!Jaune smirked as he channeled the force into his sword and flow in it sparking it making it shatter as he said," and it is gone! Now let's leave!"Akihsia found himself on the new world while Jaune on his throne in the stone battle world.Azmuth spoke up form the omnitrix," I don't know what just happened but it happened and was something!"before long Akihsia fainted to see the dream man clapping," Relax your fine the universe is Fine! Better in fact! Those drones send in information the creators send! To alter the worlds they make how they feel! All the scps come form them! and now they can't fuck with this world anymore!"The dream man clapped, "you did it boy! What ever happens now will be by the peoples hands not the power of beings beyond our understanding fucking with us for fun!"the stallion woke up got up and walked home to his harem and mother as he rubbed the back of his head," yeah weird close out though! Kind of like that comic book I read once!"in another world.Another akihsia who had a simpler omnitrix with a built in fingerless glove was putting a book with this story's initials beside ponies test and Family's book.the other Akihisa waved," Why hello this story has come to an end! But there will be another sooner or later We thing! Only time will Tell! So bye say what you loved what you hated. What you would like to see in a future akihisa wielder of the omnitrix story so on so on!"the other akihsia adjuste his tie, "but this one is over and done! It was fun and weird very weird!
